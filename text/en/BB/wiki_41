<text>The Vauxhall Chevette is a supermini car that was manufactured by Vauxhall in the United Kingdom from 1975 to 1984. It was Vauxhall&#x27;s version of the &quot;T-Car&quot; small-car family from Vauxhall&#x27;s parent General Motors (GM), and based primarily on the Opel Kadett C. The family also included the Isuzu Gemini in Japan, the Holden Gemini in Australia, the Chevrolet Chevette in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Argentina, and in the U.S. and Canada it was also rebadged as the Pontiac Acadian/Pontiac T1000. 

==Development==

The Chevette, as its name implies, was intended to be a small (baby) Chevrolet. At the same time as the Chevette project was being considered in America, Vauxhall Motors publicised a new design project, provisionally referred to as the Baby R, later designated as the S-car by GM. However, to save costs GM management shelved the S-car project and merged its styling studies with the existing T-car programme — thus the Chevette would be derived from the Opel Kadett C. The car was first launched in Brazil in 1973 as a slightly restyled Kadett with a hatchback added to the model range. This hatchback was launched in the U.S. and Britain in 1975 with restyled front ends. Initial production was at Vauxhall&#x27;s Luton, Bedfordshire, factory, then Chevette assembly was moved to the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire to allow production of the larger Cavalier and Carlton models to be moved to Luton from Opel plants in Belgium and Germany.

The UK version of the vehicle was intended to fit into the Vauxhall range below the Viva, and was initially presented only in its hatchback version, a style that became very popular during the 1970s. With its Pontiac-inspired &#x27;shovel nose&#x27; and inset headlamps, the UK version looked radically different from the Opel Kadett and was accepted by the motoring public as a completely new car; when the saloon, estate car, and van variants appeared and the hatchback was added to the Kadett lineup the common lineage became apparent. The Chevette was one of the first British-built hatchbacks of this size, the first arguably being the Austin A40 Countryman; Ford did not respond with a similar product until the following year (their similar-sized offerings all having conventional rear boots).

Sales began on 1 May 1975, from a price of £1,593. The Chevette was sold in direct competition with its Opel sister until the latter was superseded in 1979 by which time moves were already being made to merge both the Vauxhall and Opel ranges and marketing operations.

From 1975 until 1978 the Chevette was the UK&#x27;s best-selling hatchback, as UK branded rivals failed to respond to the challenge of the imported Peugeot 104, Fiat 127, and Renault 5 until the arrival of Ford&#x27;s Fiesta at the end of 1976. Chrysler UK did not launch its Chrysler Sunbeam until 1977, while only in 1980 did British Leyland come up with the Austin Metro. The Chevette also managed to outsell larger hatchbacks, including the Austin Maxi and Chrysler Alpine.

The Chevette&#x27;s 1.3-litre engine and relatively small bodyshell allowed for good performance. The Chevette had light steering, clutch, and gear change, as well as good visibility, and was spacious inside. The Chevette&#x27;s success was probably due to its versatility, which compared well with larger cars such as the Ford Escort. It was available in three-door hatchback for the single driver, saloon models that suited families, an estate car for the service fleets, and the Chevanne van version for utility purposes.



The original hatchback was launched in the UK using Vauxhall&#x27;s slogan and musical jingle, which capitalised on its practicality and widespread appeal: &quot;It&#x27;s whatever you want it to be! — A sporty coupé, a family saloon, a handy estate...&quot;. It was made at the purpose-built factory in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, under a government initiative to bring employment to the area.

More conventional two- and four-door saloons, and three-door estate variants (essentially the Kadett C with Vauxhall front bodywork and engines) were also offered from June 1976. The two-door coupé version of the Kadett C was the only version of the Opel car not to have a Chevette equivalent.

The Viva was discontinued in 1979, with the Opel Kadett D entering production in the same year. This car was intended also to be produced in the US and UK, as the second-generation Chevette, but due to various industrial issues at the time, GM decided to shelve most of the Ellesmere Port plant, retaining only the assembly shop to build the new car. These would be assembled from knock-down kits, although they were initially imported fully built-up from Opel&#x27;s plant in Bochum. Due to the huge loss of workforce this would cause, representations were made that resulted in the decision to continue production of existing models alongside the new. This meant that a new name would have to be found for Vauxhall&#x27;s version of the new Opel Kadett, so in March 1980, the Vauxhall Astra was born, replacing the Viva in the Vauxhall range, while the Chevette remained on sale until 1984. At this time, the planned mothballing of most of the Ellesmere Port plant went ahead as originally planned. Meanwhile, General Motors would develop a new entry-level model to be sold in Europe under the Vauxhall and Opel marques, and would build a factory in Zaragoza, Spain, for the production of this new car.

This longevity led to the Chevette being exported to Germany after 1979, following the discontinuation of the Kadett C to give German buyers the option of rear-wheel drive following the Kadett D&#x27;s introduction; the Chevette was unusual as it still featured rear-wheel drive, while most of its competitors were now driven by the front wheels. A further 12,332 Chevettes were sold through Opel dealers in Germany from October 1980, although they never actually carried Opel or Vauxhall branding, being badged simply as &quot;Chevette&quot;. By this time, the Chevette was the only Vauxhall-badged car to be sold in markets such as Mauritius and New Zealand; successor models assembled in the UK for sale in mainland Europe, such as the Astra, have been badged as Opels.

A van version, based on the estate and called the Bedford Chevanne, was also built, and badged as part of GM&#x27;s Bedford commercial vehicles marque.

Following the introduction of the Astra in 1980, the Chevette line-up was gradually slimmed down in terms of both trim options and body styles. By the time of the Nova&#x27;s launch in 1983 only the four-door saloon and the three-door estate versions (in two trim levels) remained on sale until the end of production.

Although the Chevette was essentially a rebadged Opel Kadett C with revised front-end styling (detailed below), it used the 1,256 cc overhead valve (OHV) engine from the Viva HC instead of the Kadett&#x27;s 1,196 cc engines, which were produced by Opel. The Kadett&#x27;s double wishbone front suspension, rear-wheel drive, and rear suspension with panhard rod, torque tube, and coil-sprung live axle, were carried over unaltered. Inside, the two cars differed only in terms of their dashboard and switchgear; the Chevette stuck to the British and Japanese right-hand drive tradition of having the indicator stalk switch on the right side of the steering column, with wipers on the left; while the Kadett used a single stalk system (typical of many 1970s German cars) on the left of the steering column to control turn signals, headlamps and wipers. The Chevette also had a much more angular instrument binnacle, although the instrument cluster itself was directly from the Kadett (though with imperial rather than metric scales).

The Chevette&#x27;s front end featured a more aerodynamic-looking nose than the Kadett, based loosely on the design of the &quot;droopsnoot&quot; Firenza, itself said to be inspired by the Pontiac Firebird, a sister GM product. In contrast the Kadett had a more conventional, flat-fronted design. In 1980, the Chevette underwent a facelift with flush fitting headlights, giving it a &quot;family look&quot; alongside the larger Vauxhall Cavalier version of the Opel Ascona B. Mechanical changes included the introduction of Bosch distributors, revised heater ducting, and a simplified throttle linkage. It also received new wheel designs, revised C-pillar vent covers, and revamped interior trim with redesigned front seats to increase rear knee room marginally. However, it was effectively the beginning of a phase-out in favour of the newer Astra, Vauxhall&#x27;s version of the front-wheel drive Kadett D, which was launched in March 1980, though it was not produced in Britain until November 1981. The Vauxhall Nova (the rebadged version of the Spanish built Opel Corsa) became the entry-level model in the Vauxhall range when it was launched in April 1983, although the Chevette continued alongside it for another year.

Production of the Chevette finally finished in 1984. A total of 415,000 Chevettes were sold in Britain.

==Overseas markets==

===Austria===
The Chevette was also sold in Austria, where it was also offered with the option of a low output version of the 1,256 engine (49.5 bhp). The range included two- and four-door L saloon and estate, GL three-door hatch, GLS four-door saloon and three-door hatch.

===Ecuador===
The local factory AYMESA produced a version of the Chevette starting in 1978. This version was called the AYMESA Cóndor. It had a glass fibre (fibreglass or glass reinforced plastic) body and a 1,500 cc engine with the higher compression cylinder head from GM Brazil to compensate for the Andean altitudes.

===France===
The Chevette was also sold in France but it did not sell well against the Peugeots and Renaults of the time. The Chevette was the last Vauxhall sold in France.

On 6 December 1979, Vauxhall announced that they were withdrawing from 11 major European countries where Vauxhall and Opel models were sold together. This was to be completed by the end of 1981.

===Germany===
Despite announcing its withdrawal from continental Europe, Vauxhall said it would export Chevettes to West Germany. At the time Opel had already started selling the Kadett D / Astra Mk1, but it was felt that there was still a market for the previous rear-wheel drive model, as a low-cost option and for buyers resistant to front-wheel drive. Accordingly, the Chevette was sold without Vauxhall badging through Opel dealers with a 1256 cc 53 PS N and a 57 PS S automatic. The only Vauxhall badging to remain was on the hub caps and steering wheel.

===New Zealand===
The Chevette was assembled by General Motors New Zealand between 1976 and 1981. All body styles that were available in the UK were sold. The first models built were three-door hatchbacks.

New Zealand had the Chevette as well as the Isuzu Gemini, while neighbouring Australia had only the Isuzu Gemini-based Holden Gemini. The Vauxhall 1,256 OHV (from the Viva and Magnum) was the standard engine unit for all New Zealand Chevette models.

Most models were of GL specification and all had metric instrumentation. A lower trim Chevanne commercial fleet model was also offered, however, unlike the European models, it used the estate bodyshell — complete with side windows — and was badged as a Vauxhall, rather than as a Bedford.

In 1979 the New Zealand Chevette had a mechanical update not fitted to the European models, Holden-developed Radial Tuned Suspension and wider tyres, giving the car superior handling over its rivals.

At the beginning of 1980 the Chevette received the facelift which included flush mounted headlamps and various new interior appointments, including extra air vents and different seats, giving more legroom in the cars.

An additional base E model was introduced to the range in 1980, aimed at fleets and budget-minded buyers, using the four-door bodyshell. This car was incredibly spartan – fitted with plain wheels and vinyl seats – and lacked reversing lamps, hazard flashers, radio and many gauges.

Production of the New Zealand Chevette ceased in June 1981, when it was replaced by the Holden Gemini, which for the New Zealand market had initially been sold as an Isuzu in the mid-1970s and then been dropped before being reintroduced. The Chevette was the last British-sourced GM product to be assembled in New Zealand.

===Sweden===
The Chevette was also sold in Sweden. It entered the market for 1976, originally only as a hatchback so as not to compete directly with the larger Viva. The range ended up a little differently from that of the UK with the two-door saloon and three-door estate only available in L spec and the hatch and four-door saloon only available in GLS spec — no E or GL models were offered, although the GL was originally planned.

===Uruguay===
In Uruguay, the Viva-based Grumett had been marketed since 1962. This was a 2+2 coupé utility based on the Viva HC, with imported metal doors and locally made fibreglass front and rear ends. A similarly constructed version of the Vauxhall Chevette was created to replace the original Grumett. However, this featured the 1.4-litre engine and mechanical underpinnings of the Brazilian Chevrolet Chevette. This was succeeded by a version which featured the Brazilian Chevette bodywork, although this time it was also available as an estate.

==Special models==

===Chevette HS and HSR===
In 1976, at the instigation of new chairman Bob Price, Vauxhall decided to increase their profile in international rallying. They developed a rally version of the Chevette in conjunction with Blydenstein Racing, which ran Dealer Team Vauxhall, the nearest equivalent to a &#x27;works&#x27; (manufacturer run) competition team that GM policy would allow.

In order to compete in international rallying, the car had to be homologated; for Group 4, the class the HS was to compete in, this meant building 400 production vehicles for public sale. Vauxhall created a far more powerful Chevette variant by fitting the 2.3 litre slant-four engine, using a 16-valve cylinder head which Vauxhall was developing — though the rally cars used the Lotus 16-valve head until a rule change by the FIA banned them in 1978. Fitted with two Stromberg carburettors the engine developed 135 bhp. Suspension and rear axle were from the Opel Kadett C GT/E and the gearbox was a Getrag five-speed. Chevrolet Vega alloy wheels (similar in appearance to the Avon wheels used on the droopsnoot Firenza) were used, as well as a newly developed glass-reinforced plastic air dam. The result was a very fast and well handling, if rather unrefined, road car. Like the Droopsnoot Firenza, the HS was available only in silver, with red highlighting and a bright red, black and tartan interior; though (partly to help sell unsold vehicles) some cars were repainted in other colours, such the black HS-X designed by David Harley of Mamos Roundabout Garage — Greenford.
The HS became a successful rally car, chalking up notable wins for drivers such as Pentti Airikkala, Jimmy McRae and Tony Pond. It was a challenge to the most successful rally car of the time, the Ford Escort, winning the British Open Rally Championship for drivers in 1979 and for manufacturers in 1981. It was also successful in other national rally championships, such as Belgium&#x27;s.

To keep the rally car competitive into the 1980s an evolution version, the Chevette HSR, was developed which was successful for several more years. The modified cars featured glass reinforced plastic (fibreglass) front and rear wings, spoiler, bonnet and tailgate (giving the HSR the nickname &#x27;Plastic Fantastic&#x27;), revised suspension (particularly at the rear, where extra suspension links were fitted), and other minor changes. Group 4 evolution required a production run of 50 cars incorporating the new modifications; these were made by rebuilding unsold HSs and by modifying customers&#x27; vehicles. However, the merger of the Vauxhall and Opel marketing departments resulted in Dealer Team Vauxhall and Dealer Opel Team (DOT) joining to form GM Dealer Sport (GMDS); with the Chevette soon to be obsolete, Opel were able to force the cancellation of the HSR rally programme in favour of the Manta 400. A 2.6-litre engine for Clubsport rallying and a , turbocharged derivative were never fully developed, thanks to the budget cuts. A few examples of the 2.6-litre engine were built, with Blydenstein offering the engine for hire to replace the 2.3-litre &quot;international&quot; engine for single events.

===Chevette Blackwatch===

These were special edition Chevettes made by Star Custom Vehicles, Station Road, Ampthill. They came with black and silver paint, red graphics, a plaque inside the door stating styles by Farina, sport steering wheel, flared arches and low-profile wheels. &quot;Blackwatch&quot; was written on the nose of the car and on the bottom of each door.

===Chevette Grenadier===

Also produced by Star Custom Vehicles, based on the Chevette L hatchback specification, with black, silver and orchid livery, colour impregnated front air dam, flexi rear spoiler, alloy wheels with locking option, head restraints, black four-spoke sport steering wheel, centre console, burled walnut fascia, hinged glove box and door capping, removable tinted glass sun hatch, and two-wave band radio / stereo cassette player with door speakers.

Both the above special editions were created by Rob Darcus of Star Custom Vehicles, who began developing special trim versions of standard models to help sell more vehicles when he was district manager for Vauxhall in London. He and Vauxhall dealer Hamilton Motors set up the Star Custom Vehicles facility in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, to carry out specialised paint work on Chevette &#x27;dealer specials&#x27; (cars restyled and re-trimmed for the dealer network and not available as a standard trim from the manufacturer). Initially cars were supplied to the London dealers that Rob Darcus was responsible for; following interest from Vauxhall, the vehicles were supplied nationally.

===Chevette Jubilee===
This special edition was produced in silver to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1977.

===Bedford Chevanne===

The Bedford Chevanne was a small commercial vehicle based on the GM T platform Vauxhall Chevette estate. Unlike the Chevette it had a flat rear floor, no rear seats and panels in place of the side windows. It was introduced in September 1976. Intended as a replacement for the Bedford HA, the Chevanne was replaced by the Bedford Astravan before the HA was cancelled. It was fitted with the same 1,256 cc inline-four as the Chevette (and the Bedford HA), although here it produced with a 7.3 to 1 compression ratio. As part of making the Chevanne as car-like as possible, it was also available with a three-speed automatic transmission. The automatic also included a heavy-duty battery and front suspension, better carpeting, and a higher compression engine (8.7 to 1) with .

A similar T-Car variant existed in Australia, the Holden Gemini van, which utilized the Chevanne&#x27;s rear panels.

<text>Salome (; , related to , &quot;peace&quot;; ), also known as Salome III, was a Jewish princess, the daughter of Herod II and princess Herodias. She was granddaughter of Herod the Great and stepdaughter of Herod Antipas. She is known from the New Testament, where she is not named, and from an account by Josephus. In the New Testament, the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas demands and receives the head of John the Baptist. According to Josephus, she was first married to her uncle Philip the Tetrarch, after whose death in AD 34 she married her cousin Aristobulus of Chalcis, thus becoming queen of Armenia Minor.

The gospel story of her dance at the birthday celebration of her stepfather, who had John the Baptist beheaded at her mother&#x27;s request, inspired art, literature and music over an extended period of time. Among the paintings are those by Titian and Gustave Moreau. Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1891 eponymous play and its 1905 operatic setting by Richard Strauss are among the literary and musical realisations which portrayed her. She also appeared in film, for instance in the 1953 &quot;Salome&quot; starring Rita Hayworth.

==First-century accounts and sources==
Salome is commonly identified with the daughter of Herodias who, according to accounts in the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew, danced for Herod Antipas. In his &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot;, Josephus mentions marriages and children of the daughter of Herodias named Salome.

===New Testament===
According to the Gospel of Mark, Herodias bore a grudge against John the Baptist for stating that Herod&#x27;s marriage to her was unlawful. Herodias&#x27;s daughter had danced before Herod at his birthday celebration, and in return she was told she could ask for anything. After consulting with her mother, the girl asked for the head of John.

The account in the Gospel of Mark reads:But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias&#x27;s daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, &quot;Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.&quot; And he vowed to her, &quot;Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.&quot; And she went out and said to her mother, &quot;For what should I ask?&quot; And she said, &quot;The head of John the Baptist.&quot; And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, &quot;I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&quot; And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John&#x27;s head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.

The parallel passage in the Gospel of Matthew reads:

Some ancient Greek versions of Mark read &quot;Herod&#x27;s daughter Herodias&quot; (rather than &quot;daughter of the said Herodias&quot;). To scholars using these ancient texts, both mother and daughter had the same name. However, the Latin Vulgate Bible translates the passage as it is above, and western Church Fathers therefore tended to refer to Salome as &quot;Herodias&#x27;s daughter&quot; or just &quot;the girl&quot;. Because she is otherwise unnamed in the Bible, the idea that both mother and daughter were named Herodias gained some currency in early modern Europe. The New Revised Standard Version follows this, translating Mark 6:22 as &quot;When his daughter Herodias[a] came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, &#x27;Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it, with a footnote: &quot;[a] Other ancient authorities read &#x27;the daughter of Herodias herself.

Herodias&#x27;s daughter is arguably not Salome the disciple, who is a witness to the crucifixion of Jesus in Mark 15:40. However, the apocryphal &quot;Book of the Resurrection of Christ&quot;, pseudonymically attributed to the apostle Bartholomew, names a &quot;Salome the temptress&quot; as among the women who went to the empty tomb; perhaps reflecting an early tradition that Salome, the daughter of Herodias, was at the tomb.

===Josephus===
Salome is mentioned as a stepdaughter of Herod Antipas in Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (Book XVIII, Chapter 5, 4):Herodias [...] was married to Herod, the son of Herod the Great, who was born of Mariamne, the daughter of Simon the high priest, who had a daughter, Salome; after whose birth Herodias took upon her to confound the laws of our country, and divorced herself from her husband while he was alive, and was married to Herod, her husband&#x27;s brother by the father&#x27;s side, he was tetrarch of Galilee; but her daughter Salome was married to Philip, the son of Herod, and tetrarch of Trachonitis; and as he died childless, Aristobulus, the son of Herod, the brother of Agrippa, married her; they had three sons, Herod, Agrippa, and Aristobulus;
According to William Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities&quot;:
A tradition based on Joseph situates her birth in the Spanish city of Italica and her death in Lleida.

===Coins===

A few coins with portraits of Aristobulus and Salome have been found.

==Depictions in art and media==


The story of her dance before Herod with the head of John the Baptist on a platter led medieval Christian artists to depict her as the personification of the lascivious woman, a temptress who lures men away from salvation.

Christian traditions depict her as an icon of dangerous female seductiveness, notably in regard to the dance mentioned in the New Testament, which is thought to have had an erotic element to it, and in some later transformations it has further been iconized as the &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot;. Other elements of Christian tradition concentrate on her lighthearted and cold foolishness that, according to the gospels, led to John&#x27;s death. David Flusser, a scholar of early Christianity, believes that her &quot;biographical profile suggests a normal, moral personality&quot;. Nevertheless, a similar motif was struck by Oscar Wilde in his &quot;Salome&quot;, in which she plays a femme fatale, and by Ada L. Harris in her 1906 novel &quot;The Sin Of Salome&quot;, who casts her as a predatory vampire seductress. This parallel representation of the Christian iconography, made even more memorable by Richard Strauss&#x27; opera based on Wilde&#x27;s work, is as consistent with Josephus&#x27; account as the traditional Christian depiction; however, according to the Romanized Jewish historian, Salome lived long enough to marry twice and raise several children. Few literary accounts elaborate the biographical data given by Josephus.

Despite Josephus&#x27; account, she was not consistently called Salome until the 19th century when Gustave Flaubert (following Josephus) referred to her as &quot;Salome&quot; in his short story &quot;Herodias&quot;.

===Painting and sculpture===
This biblical story has long been a favorite of painters. Painters who have done notable representations of Salome include Masolino da Panicale, Filippo Lippi, Benozzo Gozzoli, Leonardo da Vinci followers Andrea Solario and Bernardino Luini, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Titian, Caravaggio, Guido Reni, Fabritius, Henri Regnault, Georges Rochegrosse, Gustave Moreau, Lovis Corinth, Federico Beltran-Masses and Henry Ossawa Tanner.

Titian&#x27;s version (&quot;illustration&quot; c.1515) emphasizes the contrast between the innocent girlish face and the brutally severed head. Because of the maid by her side, this Titian painting, like others of the subject, is also considered to be &quot;Judith with the Head of Holofernes&quot;. Unlike Salome who goes nameless in the Christian bible, Judith is a Judeo-Christian mythical patriot whose story is perhaps less psychological and as she was a widow, may not be particularly girlish nor innocent in representations.

In Moreau&#x27;s version (&quot;illustration&quot;) the figure of Salome is emblematic of the femme fatale, a fashionable trope of fin-de-siecle decadence. In his 1884 novel &quot;À rebours&quot;, Frenchman Joris-Karl Huysmans describes the depiction of Salome in Moreau&#x27;s painting:

No longer was she merely the dancing-girl who extorts a cry of lust and concupiscence from an old man by the lascivious contortions of her body; who breaks the will, masters the mind of a King by the spectacle of her quivering bosoms, heaving belly and tossing thighs; she was now revealed in a sense as the symbolic incarnation of world-old Vice, the goddess of immortal Hysteria, the Curse of Beauty supreme above all other beauties by the cataleptic spasm that stirs her flesh and steels her muscles, – a monstrous Beast of the Apocalypse, indifferent, irresponsible, insensible, poisoning.
===Sacred vocal music===
Salome appears as a character in Alessandro Stradella&#x27;s oratorio (St. John the Baptist), composed in 1676, which includes &quot;Queste lagrime e sospiri&quot;, an aria sung by the Salome character.

===Theatre and literature===
In 1877 Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Three Tales&quot; were published, including &quot;Herodias&quot;. In this story, responsibility for John&#x27;s death is given to Herodias and the priests who fear his religious power. Salome is shown as a young girl who forgets the name of the man whose head she requests as she is asking for it. Jules Massenet&#x27;s 1881 opera &quot;Hérodiade&quot; is based on Flaubert&#x27;s short story. Playwright Doric Wilson created a modern retelling of the Salome story in &quot;Now She Dances!&quot;, first produced off-off-Broadway at the Caffe Cino in 1961.
====Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play====

Salome&#x27;s story was made the subject of a symbolist play by Oscar Wilde that was first banned in London in 1892 while rehearsals were underway and which subsequently premiered in Paris in 1896 under the French name &quot;Salomé&quot;. In Wilde&#x27;s play, Salome takes a perverse fancy for Jokanaan (John the Baptist), and causes him to be executed when he spurns her affections. In the finale, Salome takes up Jokanaan&#x27;s severed head and kisses it.

At the time, British law forbade the depiction of biblical figures on stage. Wilde wrote the play originally in French and then published an English translation by his lover Lord Alfred Douglas (titled &quot;Salome&quot;). To this Granville Bantock composed incidental music, which was premiered at the Court Theatre, London, on 19 April 1918.

====Operas based on Wilde&#x27;s play====

The Wilde play (in a German translation by Hedwig Lachmann) was edited down to a one-act opera by Richard Strauss. The opera, which premiered in Dresden in 1905, is famous for the Dance of the Seven Veils. As with the Wilde play, it turns the action to Salome, reducing her mother to a bit-player, though the opera is less centered on Herod&#x27;s motivations than the play.

Shortly after the success of Strauss&#x27; opera, Antoine Mariotte created another opera based on Wilde&#x27;s original French script. It was premiered on 30 October 1908 at the Grand Théâtre at Lyon. This opera was revived only in 2005 at the Montpellier Festival.

====Ballet====
In 1907 Florent Schmitt received a commission from Jacques Rouché to compose a ballet, &quot;La tragédie de Salomé&quot;, for Loie Fuller to perform at the Théâtre des Arts. Another &quot;Salome&quot; ballet was composed by the Japanese composer Akira Ifukube in 1948. Danish choreographer Flemming Flindt&#x27;s ballet &quot;Salome&quot; with music by Peter Maxwell Davies premiered in 1978. 
====Poetry====
In &quot;Salome&quot; (1896) by the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, Salome instigates the death of John the Baptist as part of a futile effort to get the interest of &quot;a young sophist who was indifferent to the charms of love&quot;. When Salome presents to him John&#x27;s head, the sophist rejects it, remarking in jest &quot;Dear Salome, I would have liked better to get your own head&quot;. Taking the jest seriously, the hopelessly infatuated Salome lets herself be beheaded, and her head is duly brought to the sophist, who however rejects it in disgust and turns back to studying the Dialogues of Plato.

===Other music===
A descriptive piano piece by Mel Bonis entitled &quot;Salomé&quot; (1909) is part of her series, &quot;Femmes de Légende&quot;. Archibald Joyce composed three &#x27;valses orientales&#x27; throughout his career: &quot;Vision of Salome&quot; (1909), &quot;Passing of Salome&quot; (1912), and &quot;Phantom of Salome&quot; (1945).

===Film===

Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; has often been made into a film, notably a 1923 silent film, &quot;Salome&quot;, starring Alla Nazimova in the title role and a 1988 Ken Russell play-within-a-film treatment, &quot;Salome&#x27;s Last Dance&quot;, which also includes Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas as characters. Steven Berkoff filmed his stage version of the play in 1992.

In the 1950 film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, the principal character Norma Desmond is portrayed as writing a screenplay for a silent film treatment of the legend of Salome, attempting to get the screenplay produced, and performing one of the scenes from her screenplay after going mad.

She was portrayed by Jayalalitha in the 1973 film Jesus.

Among the numerous art references in Dario Argento&#x27;s 1977 film, &quot;Suspiria&quot;, we can see four of Aubrey Beardsley&#x27;s illustrations for Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1891 tragedy, &quot;Salome&quot;.

Other Salome films include:
* &quot;Salomé&quot; (1918), starring Theda Bara in the title role. Flavius Josephus was credited for the story.
* &quot;Salomé&quot; (1953), starring Rita Hayworth in the title role.
* &quot;Salomé&quot; (1972), starring Carmelo Bene and Donyale Luna in the title role.
* &quot;Salome&quot; (1986), a French-Italian production.
* &quot;Salomé&quot; (2002), directed by Carlos Saura, using flamenco dance.
* &quot;Salome&quot; (2013), a film by Al Pacino. Salomé is played by Jessica Chastain.

<doc id="232205" wikidata="Q1756688" url="?curid=232205" title="Panhard rod">
<text>A Panhard rod (also called Panhard bar, track bar, or track rod) is a suspension link that provides lateral location of the axle. Originally invented by the Panhard automobile company of France in the early twentieth century, this device has been widely used ever since.

==Overview==
The purpose of automobile suspension is to let the wheels move vertically with respect to the body, while preventing movement forward and backwards (longitudinally), or side to side (laterally). 

The Panhard rod is a simple device designed to prevent lateral movement. It consists of a rigid bar running sideways in the same plane as the axle, connecting one end of the axle to the car body or chassis on the opposite side of the vehicle. The bar attaches on either end with pivots that let it swivel upwards and downwards only, limiting the axle&#x27;s movement to the vertical plane. This does not effectively locate the axle longitudinally, therefore it is usually used in conjunction with trailing arms that stabilize the axle in the longitudinal direction. 

A Panhard rod is typically used with coil spring suspensions; with a leaf spring suspension, the springs themselves usually supply enough lateral rigidity. However, Ford used a similar connected &quot;rear axle damper&quot; (fifth shock) on some Explorers and light trucks with rear leaf springs. Jaguar also used a Panhard rod to locate the rear axle on its unusual cantilever leaf sprung Mark 2.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The advantage of the Panhard rod is its simplicity. Its major disadvantage is that the body must necessarily move in an arc relative to the axle, with the radius equal to the length of the Panhard rod. If the rod is too short, it allows excessive sideways movement between the axle and the body at the ends of the spring travel. Therefore, the Panhard rod is less desirable on smaller cars than larger ones. 

Two notable exceptions to this are the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini and Suzuki Jimny. Both are small light vehicles (they fall in the light vehicles category in Japan) that have a Panhard rod, but the off-road nature of these vehicles mean that the lateral movement between axle and body is not important. A suspension design that is similar but dramatically reduces the sideways component of the axle&#x27;s vertical travel is a Watt&#x27;s linkage.

==Applications==
Some vehicles with live-axle suspensions cannot use a Watt&#x27;s linkage due to design or other practical constraints; these often incorporate a Panhard rod as a component of the front suspension. The Mercedes-Benz G-Class was redesigned in 2018 to include a Panhard rod on the rear axle to improve its on-road handling characteristics.

<doc id="232210" wikidata="Q244730" url="?curid=232210" title="Rajya Sabha">
<text>The Rajya Sabha (lit: &quot;States&#x27; Assembly&quot;), also known as the Council of States, is the upper house of the Parliament of India which is bicameral. , it has a maximum membership of 245, of which 233 are elected by the State legislative assemblies of India and of union territories using single transferable votes through open ballots, while the President of India can appoint 12 members for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social service. The total allowed capacity is 250 (238 elected, 12 appointed) according to article 80 of the Constitution of India. The current potential seating capacity of the Rajya Sabha is 245 (233 elected, 12 appointed), after the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Act. The maximum seats of 250 members can be filled up at the discretion and requirements of the house of Rajya Sabha.

Members sit for staggered terms lasting six years, with about a third of the 233 designates up for election every two years, in even-numbered years. Unlike the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha is a continuing chamber and hence not subject to dissolution. However, the Rajya Sabha, like the Lok Sabha, can be prorogued by the president.

The Rajya Sabha has equal footing in legislation with the Lok Sabha, except in the area of Loss of supply, where the latter has overriding powers. In the case of conflicting legislation, a Joint Session of Indian Parliament of the two houses can be held, where the Lok Sabha would hold a greater influence because of its larger membership. The vice president of India (currently, Jagdeep Dhankhar) is the &quot;ex-officio&quot; chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its sessions. The Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who is elected from amongst the house&#x27;s members, takes care of the day-to-day matters of the house in the absence of the chairman. The Rajya Sabha held its first sitting on 13 May 1952.

The Rajya Sabha meets in the eponymous chamber in Parliament House (India) in New Delhi. Since 18 July 2018, the Rajya Sabha has the facility for simultaneous interpretation in all the Languages with official status in India. The Rajya Sabha proceedings are televised live on channel Sansad TV, headquartered within the premises of Parliament.
The new parliament has a seating capacity of 384 for Rajya Sabha.

==Qualifications==
Article 84 of the Constitution lays down the qualifications for membership of Parliament. A member of the Rajya Sabha must:
* Be a citizen of India.
* Make and subscribe before some person authorized in that behalf by the Election Commission an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule to the Constitution.
* Be at least 30 years old.
* Not be a proclaimed criminal.
* Not be a subject of insolvency, i.e. they should not be in debt that they are not capable of repaying in a current manner and should have the ability to meet their financial expenses.
* Not hold any other office of profit under the Government of India.
* Not be of unsound mind.
* Possess such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by Parliament.

==Membership==
===Elected Members===
Based on the , 233 members are elected by the Legislative Assembly of States and Union territories by means of single transferable vote through proportional representation.

===Nominated members===
Based on the , twelve members are nominated by the President of India who have special knowledge in various areas like arts and science. However, they are not entitled to vote in presidential elections as per Article 55 of the Constitution.

==Limitations==
The Constitution of India places some restrictions on the Rajya Sabha, and the Lok Sabha (the lower house, House of the People) is more powerful in certain areas.

===Money bills===
The definition of a money bill is given in Article 110 of the Constitution of India. A money bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha by a minister and only on the recommendation of the president of India. When the Lok Sabha passes a money bill then the Lok Sabha sends the money bill to the Rajya Sabha for 14 days during which it can make recommendations. Even if the Rajya Sabha fails to return the money bill in 14 days to the Lok Sabha, that bill is deemed to have passed by both houses. Also, if the Lok Sabha rejects any (or all) of the amendments proposed by the Rajya Sabha, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both houses of Parliament in the form the Lok Sabha finally passes it. Hence, the Rajya Sabha can only give recommendations for a money bill, but the Rajya Sabha cannot amend a money bill. This is to ensure that the Rajya Sabha must not add any non-money matters to the money bill. There is no joint sitting of both the houses for money bills, because all final decisions are taken by the Lok Sabha.

===Joint Sitting of the Parliament===
Article 108 provides for a joint sitting of the two houses of Parliament in certain cases. A joint sitting can be convened by the president of India when one house has either rejected a bill passed by the other house, has not taken any action on a bill transmitted to it by the other house for six months, or has disagreed with the amendments proposed by the Lok Sabha on a bill passed by it. Considering that the numerical strength of the Lok Sabha is more than twice that of the Rajya Sabha, the Lok Sabha tends to have a greater influence in a joint sitting of Parliament. A joint session is chaired by the speaker of the Lok Sabha. Also, because the joint session is convened by the president on the advice of the government, which already has a majority in the Lok Sabha, the joint session is usually convened to get bills passed through a Rajya Sabha in which the government has a minority.

Joint sessions of Parliament are a rarity, and have been convened three times in the last 71 years, for passage of a specific legislative act, the latest time being in 2002:
* 1961: &quot;Dowry Prohibition Act, 1958&quot;
* 1978: &quot;Banking Services Commission (Repeal) Act, 1977&quot;
* 2002: &quot;Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002&quot;

===No-confidence motion===
Unlike the Lok Sabha, members of the Rajya Sabha cannot bring to the house a no-confidence motion against the government.

==Powers==

In the Indian quasi-federal structure, the Rajya Sabha is representative of the States and Union territories in the union legislature (hence the name, Council of States). For this reason, the Rajya Sabha has powers that protect the rights of States against the Union government.

===Union-State relations===
The Constitution empowers the Parliament of India to make laws on the matters reserved for States. However, this can only be done if the Rajya Sabha first passes a resolution by a two-third majority granting such a power to the Union Parliament. The Union government cannot make a law on a matter reserved for States without any authorisation from the Rajya Sabha.

The Union government reserves the power to make laws directly affecting the citizens across all the 
States whereas, a single state in itself reserves the power to make rules and governing laws of their region. The Rajya Sabha plays a vital role in protecting the States&#x27; culture and interests.

===Creation of All-India services===
The Rajya Sabha, by a two-thirds super majority, can pass a resolution empowering the Indian government to create more all-India services common to both the union and the states.

==Membership by party==

Members of the Rajya Sabha by their political party ():
==Composition==

Seats are allotted in proportion to the population of each state or union territory. Because of population changes since previous apportionment of seats, states which once had higher relative populations may have more seats than other states which currently have a higher population. For example, Tamil Nadu has 18 representatives for 72 million inhabitants (in 2011) whereas Bihar (104 million) and West Bengal (91 million) only have 16. As the members are elected by the state legislature, some small union territories, those without legislatures, cannot have representation. Hence, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Ladakh and Lakshadweep do not send any representatives. Twelve members are nominated by the president.

As per the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950, the Rajya Sabha was to consist of 216 members, of which 12 members were to be nominated by the president and the remaining 204 elected to represent the states. The present sanctioned strength of the Rajya Sabha in the Constitution of India is 250, which can be increased by constitutional amendment. However, the present strength is 245 members according to the Representation of People Act, 1951, which can be increased up to 250 by amending the act itself, of whom 233 are representatives of the states and union territories and 12 are nominated by the president. The 12 nominated members of the Rajya Sabha are persons who are eminent in particular fields and are well-known contributors in the particular field.

=== Number of members by state/union territory ===
== Officers of the House ==
===Chairman===
The Chairman is the presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha and is ex-officio the Vice President of India. Currently, Jagdeep Dhankhar serves as the Chairman, since August 2022. 

===Deputy Chairman===
The Deputy Chairman is elected by the Rajya Sabha from among its members and acts as the presiding officer in the absence of the Chairman. Currently, Harivansh Narayan Singh serves as the Deputy Chairman, since September 2020.

===Leader of the House===
Besides the chairman (vice-president of India) and the deputy chairman, there is also a position called &quot;leader of the House&quot;. This is a cabinet minister – the prime minister if they are a member of the House or another nominated minister. The leader has a seat next to the chairman, in the front row.

===Leader of the Opposition===
Besides the leader of the House, who is the government&#x27;s chief representative in the House, there is also a leader of the opposition (LOP) – leading the opposition parties. The function was only recognized in the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of the Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977. This is commonly the leader of the largest non-government party and is recognized as such by the chairman.

===Panel of Vice-Chairpersons===
A group of members nominated by the Chairman to preside over the sessions of the Rajya Sabha in the absence of both the Chairman and Deputy Chairman. The current Vice-Chairpersons include Phangnon Konyak, P. T. Usha, Kiran Choudhry, Mamata Mohanta, Ghanshyam Tiwari, Sasmit Patra, Ajay Makan, and Bhubaneswar Kalita.

===Secretary General===
The Secretary General is the principal executive officer of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat and serves as the chief advisor to the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha on parliamentary matters. Currently, Pramod Chandra Mody serves as the Secretary General, since November 2021.

==Secretariat==
The Secretariat of the Rajya Sabha was set up under the provisions contained in Article 98 of the Constitution. The said Article, which provides for a separate secretarial staff for each house of Parliament, reads as follows:- 98. Secretariat of Parliament – Each House of Parliament shall have a separate secretarial staff: Provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed as preventing the creation of posts common to both Houses of Parliament. (2) Parliament may by law regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to the secretarial staff of either House of Parliament.

The Rajya Sabha Secretariat functions under the overall guidance and control of the chairman. The main activities of the Secretariat &quot;inter alia&quot; include the following:

(i) providing secretarial assistance and support to the effective functioning of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha); (ii) providing amenities as admissible to Members of Rajya Sabha; (iii) servicing the various Parliamentary Committees;
(iv) preparing research and reference material and bringing out various publications;
(v) recruitment of manpower in the Sabha Secretariat and attending to personnel matters; and
(vi) preparing and publishing a record of the day-to-day proceedings of the Rajya Sabha and bringing out such other publications, as may be required concerning the functioning of the Rajya Sabha and its Committees.

In the discharge of their constitutional and statutory responsibilities, the chairman of the Rajya Sabha is assisted by the secretary-general, who holds the rank equivalent to the cabinet secretary to the government of India. The secretary-general, in turn, is assisted by senior functionaries at the level of secretary, additional secretary, joint secretary and other officers and staff of the secretariat. The present secretary-general is Pramod Chandra Mody. In the winter 2019 session, uniforms of Rajya Sabha marshals were restyled from traditional Indian attire comprising turbans to dark navy blue and olive green military-style outfits with caps.

==Media==

Sansad TV (STV) is a 24-hour parliamentary television channel owned and operated jointly by both houses of Indian Parliament. The channel aims to provide in-depth coverage and analysis of parliamentary affairs, especially its functioning and policy development. During sessions, Sansad TV provides live coverage and presents an analysis of the proceedings of the house as well as other day-to-day parliamentary events and developments.

Earlier both houses of parliament had their own channels named Rajya Sabha TV and Lok Sabha TV Respectively.

<doc id="232213" wikidata="Q8038640" url="?curid=232213" title="Wrongful death claim">
<text>Wrongful death is a type of legal claim or cause of action against a person who can be held liable for a death. The claim is brought in a civil action, usually by close relatives, as authorized by statute. In wrongful death cases, survivors are compensated for the harm and losses they have suffered after losing a loved one.

== Types of wrongful death claims ==
Any fatality caused by the wrongful acts of another may result in a wrongful death claim. Wrongful death claims are often based upon death resulting from negligence, for example following a motor vehicle accident caused by another driver, a dangerous roadway or defective vehicle, product liability, and medical malpractice. Dangerous roadway claims result from deaths caused in whole or in part by the condition of the roadway.

==Common law jurisdictions==

In most common law jurisdictions, there was no common law right to recover civil damages for the wrongful death of a person. Under common law, a dead person cannot bring a suit (under the maxim &quot;actio personalis moritur cum persona&quot;), and this created an anomaly in which activities that resulted in a person&#x27;s injury would result in civil sanction, but activities that resulted in a person&#x27;s death would not. Some jurisdictions recognized a common law right of recovery for wrongful death, reasoning that &quot;there is no present public policy against allowing recovery for wrongful death.&quot; In other jurisdictions the cause of action did not exist until the passage of a wrongful death statute.

Jurisdictions that recognize the common law right to recovery for wrongful death have used the right to fill in gaps in statutes or to apply common law principles to decisions. Many jurisdictions enacted statutes to create a right to such recovery. The issue of liability will be determined by the tort law of a given state or nation.

It may be possible for a family to seek retribution against someone who kills or is accused of killing a family member through tort rather than a criminal prosecution, which has a higher burden of proof. However, the two actions are not mutually exclusive; a person may be prosecuted criminally for causing a person&#x27;s death (whether in the form of murder, manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, or some other theory) and that person can also be sued civilly in a wrongful death action (as in the O.J. Simpson murder case).

===Australia===
In Australia, the standard of proof in a wrongful death action is &#x27;on the balance of probabilities&#x27;.

To an extent, people can protect themselves from wrongful death lawsuits by having the participants sign a waiver.

===United States===

&quot;Wrongful death&quot; is a cause of action, or type of claim, that can be brought when one person or entity wrongfully causes someone&#x27;s death. It allows a lawsuit to be filed even though the person who was harmed is no longer alive to bring the case. Each state has its own wrongful death statute and, although the details of the statutes vary significantly from state to state, the roots of most can be traced back to Lord Campbell&#x27;s Act, passed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Parliament in 1846. In some states, the family of the decedent must bring two different types of claims: a &quot;wrongful death&quot; claim to recover the &quot;full value of the life&quot; of the deceased, and a &quot;survival&quot; claim on behalf of the decedent&#x27;s estate to recover for funeral expenses, pain and suffering, or punitive damages.

The standard of proof in the United States is typically preponderance of the evidence as opposed to clear and convincing or beyond a reasonable doubt.

Each state has different laws regarding wrongful death claims. In most states, the statute of limitations (time limit to file a case) varies according to how the death occurred. For example, in Oregon, many wrongful death claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations - but there are many exceptions, including: when alcohol is involved, when a public body is involved, or in product liability claims.

One of the most difficult wrongful death issues — and a particularly poignant illustration of how wrongful death expands liability beyond what was available at common law — is whether a wrongful death claim can be founded upon intentional infliction of emotional distress that caused the decedent to commit suicide. The first jurisdiction to allow such a claim was California in 1960, followed by Mississippi, New Hampshire, and Wyoming.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, liability for causing a wrongful death was initially codified into legislation by the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 (Lord Campbell&#x27;s Act). The burden of proof in a wrongful death action is &#x27;on the balance of probabilities&#x27;.

Liability is now to be had via the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.

<text>The Bloods are a primarily African-American street gang which was founded in Los Angeles, California. The gang is widely known for its rivalry with the Crips. It is identified by the red color worn by its members and by particular gang symbols, including distinctive hand signs.

The Bloods comprise various subgroups known as &quot;sets&quot;, among which significant differences exist, such as colors, clothing, operations, and political ideas that may be in open conflict with each other. Since the gang&#x27;s creation, it has branched throughout the United States.

== History ==
The Bloods gang was formed initially to compete against the influence of the Crips in Los Angeles. The rivalry originated in the late 1960s when Raymond Washington and other Crips attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School in Compton, California. As a result, Scott formed the Piru Street Boys, the first &quot;Bloods&quot; gang. Owens subsequently established the West Piru gang. The Bloods was initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. Many of the non-Crip gangs used to call one another &quot;blood&quot;. On March 21, 1972, shortly after a concert featuring Wilson Pickett and Curtis Mayfield, 20 youths belonging to the Crips attacked and robbed Robert Ballou Jr. outside the Hollywood Palladium. Ballou was beaten to death after refusing to give up his leather jacket. The sensational media coverage of the crime and the continued assaults by the Crips increased their notoriety. Several non-Crips gangs formed during this period were no match for the Crips and became concerned with the escalating Crip attacks. The Pirus, Black P. Stones, Athens Park Boys and other gangs not aligned with the Crips often clashed with them. On June 5, 1972, three months after Ballou&#x27;s murder, Fredrick &quot;Lil Country&quot; Garret was murdered by a Westside Crip. This marked the first Crips murder against another gang member and motivated non-Crip gangs to align with each other. The Brims struck back on August 4, 1972, by murdering Thomas Ellis, an original Westside Crip. By late 1972, the Pirus held a meeting in their neighborhood to discuss growing Crip pressure and intimidation. Several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips joined the Pirus to create a new federation of non-Crips neighborhoods. This alliance became the Bloods. The Pirus are therefore considered the founders of the Bloods.

By 1978, there were 15 Blood sets. Crips still outnumbered Bloods 3 to 1. To assert their power, the Bloods became increasingly violent. During the 1980s, Bloods began distributing crack cocaine in Los Angeles. Blood membership soon rose dramatically as did the number of states in which they were present. These increases were primarily driven by profits from crack cocaine distribution. The huge profits allowed members to relocate to other cities and states.

=== United Blood Nation ===

&quot;Bloods&quot; is a universal term used to refer to West Coast Bloods and United Blood Nation (UBN, also known as the East Coast Bloods). These two groups are traditionally distinct, but both call themselves &quot;Bloods&quot;. UBN started in 1993 in Rikers Island&#x27;s George Motchan Detention Center (GMDC) to form protection from the Latin Kings and Ñetas who were targeting African-American gang members. UBN is a loose confederation of predominantly African-American street gangs. Once released from prison, UBN leaders went back to their New York neighborhoods, where they retained the Bloods name and started recruiting members. UBN has between 7,000 and 15,000 members in the Eastern US. It makes its income through various criminal activities, including distribution of crack cocaine and smuggling drugs into prison.

==Membership==
Bloods are a loosely structured association of smaller street gangs, known as &quot;sets&quot;, that have a common gang culture. Each set has its own leader and generally operates independently from the others. Most Bloods members are African-American males, although some sets have recruited female members as well as members from other races and ethnic backgrounds. Members range in age from early teens to mid-20s, but some hold leadership positions into their late twenties and occasionally thirties.

There is no known national leader of the Bloods but individual Blood sets have a hierarchical leadership structure with identifiable levels of membership. These levels of membership indicate status within a gang. A leader, typically an older member with a more extensive criminal background, runs each set. A set leader is not elected but rather asserts himself by developing and managing the gang&#x27;s criminal enterprises through his reputation for violence and ruthlessness and his charisma. The majority of set members are called &quot;soldiers&quot;, who are typically 16 to 22. Soldiers have a strong sense of commitment to their set and are extremely dangerous because of their willingness to use violence both to obtain the respect of gang members and to respond to any person who &quot;disrespects&quot; the set. &quot;Associates&quot; are not full members, but identify with the gang and take part in various criminal activities. To the extent that women belong to the gang, they are usually associates and tend to be used by their male counterparts to carry weapons, hold drugs, or prostitute themselves to make money for their set.

Recruitment is often influenced by a recruit&#x27;s environment. Bloods recruit heavily among school-age youth in poor African-American communities. Gang membership offers youth a sense of belonging and protection. It also offers immediate gratification to economically disadvantaged youth who desire the trappings of gang life, such as gold jewelry, cash, and expensive sports clothing. Blood sets have a loose structure of ranks based on how long a person has been involved with a particular set. The ranks do not signify leadership or dominance over the set; they merely signify respect for those who have been in the set longer and have survived the longest. Those with a higher rank do not have a position of authority over those of lower rank.

Bloods members commonly call themselves CKs (Crip Killer), MOBs (Member of Bloods), dawgs, or ballers (meaning drug dealers). The gang has a membership of between approximately 15,000 and 20,000 active in 123 cities and in 33 U.S. states, primarily on the West Coast and, to a lesser extent, the Great Lakes region and the Southeast. Gangs including Bloods have been documented in the U.S. military, in both U.S. and overseas bases. Blood sets also operate in the Canadian cities of Montreal and Toronto.

==Identification==

Bloods members identify themselves through various indicators, such as colors, clothing, symbols, tattoos, jewelry, graffiti, language, and hand signs. The Bloods&#x27; gang color is red. They like to wear sports clothing, including jackets that show their gang color. The most commonly used Bloods symbols include the number &quot;5&quot;, the five-pointed star, and the five-pointed crown. These symbols are meant to show the Bloods&#x27; affiliation with the People Nation, a large coalition of affiliates created to protect alliance members in federal and state prison. These symbols may be seen in the tattoos, jewelry, and clothing gang members wear as well as the gang graffiti with which Bloods mark their territory. Such graffiti can include gang names, nicknames, declaration of loyalty, threats against rival gangs, or descriptions of criminal acts in which the gang has been involved.

Bloods graffiti can include rival gang symbols (especially those of the Crips) drawn upside down. This is meant as an insult to the rival group and its symbols. Bloods members also have a distinctive slang. They greet each other using the word &quot;Blood&quot; and often avoid using words with the letter &quot;C&quot;. Bloods use hand signs to communicate with one another. Hand signs may be a singular movement, like the American Sign Language letter &quot;B&quot;, or a series of movements using one or both hands for more complex phrases. United Blood Nation (UBN) or East Coast Bloods initiates often receive a dog paw mark, represented by three dots, often burned with a cigarette on their right shoulder. Other UBN symbols include a bulldog and a bull.

==Sets==
The Bloods gang is a network of individual chapters known as &quot;sets&quot;. These sets are often loosely connected, having their own leader(s) and operating independently from one another.

<text>Sidney Gilman is an American retired physician, neurologist, and educator. He is an expert on Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and has spent the majority of his career at the University of Michigan, its medical school, and its Health System.

==Early life, family and education==
Gilman was raised in California. In 1950, he graduated from Huntington Park High School in Huntington Park, California.

He graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for his undergraduate degree in 1954 and its medical school in 1957, receiving the highest academic honors. During his college years, he was a gymnastics athlete.

He completed his medical residency at Boston City Hospital and a neurology fellowship at Harvard Medical School. He completed a neurophysiology fellowship from 1958 to 1960 at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Career==
Dr. Gilman taught at Harvard Medical School after he completed his research fellowship. He worked at the National Institutes of Health and performed authoritative research regarding brain control of motor functions and muscle tone. He began working at Columbia University in 1968, and in 1976 he was named the first H. Houston Merritt chair in research neurology. In 1977, however, he became professor, chair and chief of service of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School. The hospital&#x27;s neurology service named after him, as well as a lecture series. He published hundreds of articles and delivered decades of lectures. His university salary eventually was over US$300,000.

His research and areas of interest have involved brain and spinal cord injury, neurological degenerative diseases, and the effects of alcohol on the brain, R.E.M. sleep disorders, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Lewy body disease, and cardiac denervation among many other subjects. Some of his research has been in connection with many of the world&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. In the 2000s, he also worked as a consultant for Wall Street investors including Pequot Capital and Longitude Capital. These jobs increased Gilman&#x27;s income by more than US$200,000 per year.

Gilman has held numerous editorial and advisory board positions with major scientific publications, including &quot;Neurology&quot;, &quot;Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology&quot;, &quot;Applied Neurophysiology&quot;, &quot;Experimental Neurology&quot;, &quot;Annals of Neurology&quot;, &quot;Neurobiology of Disease&quot;, and &quot;Alzheimer Disease &amp; Associated Disorders&quot;.

== Bapineuzumab controversy ==
In 2013, Gilman was implicated in the insider trading scandal concerning the Alzheimer&#x27;s medication bapineuzumab, a drug which was being developed by Wyeth and Élan. In exchange for lighter punishment, Gilman agreed to testify and implicate Mathew Martoma of CR Intrinsic, a company affiliated with the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. It was considered &quot;the most lucrative insider trading scheme in history.&quot; Gilman served no prison time and returned his earnings with interest.

As a result, the University of Michigan disassociated itself from him.

==Personal life==
Gilman and his first wife Linda had two sons, Jeff and Todd. The marriage ended in divorce. Jeff, like his paternal grandmother, committed suicide.
In 1984 Sid Gilman married Carol Barbour, a psychoanalyst.

After being diagnosed with lymphoma, he received chemotherapy treatment successfully.

<doc id="232223" wikidata="Q247034" url="?curid=232223" title="Mezuzah">
<text>A mezuzah ( &quot;doorpost&quot;; plural: mezuzot) is a piece of parchment inscribed with specific Hebrew verses from the Torah, which Jews affix in a small case to the doorposts of their homes. These verses are the Biblical passages in which the use of a mezuzah is commanded ( and ); they also form part of the Shema prayer.

According to traditional Jewish law, a &quot;mezuzah&quot; must be placed on every post-and-lintel entrance to a residence, courtyard, or city. Since the time of Meir of Rothenburg (), religious Jews have increasingly also placed &quot;mezuzot&quot; on the entrances to non-residential buildings such as synagogues and offices, and on each internal doorway of the home or building, with the exception of bathrooms (where the name of God is forbidden) and small closets.

The &quot;klaf&quot; is prepared by a qualified scribe (&quot;&quot;sofer stam&quot;) who has undergone training, both in studying the relevant religious laws, and in the more practical parts—i.e., carving the quill and practising writing. The verses are written in indelible black ink with a special quill pen made either from a feather or, now quite rare, a reed. The &quot;klaf&quot; is then rolled up and placed inside the case.

== Etymology ==
In the Bible, the word &quot;mezuzah&quot; only refers to the two &#x27;doorposts&#x27; or &#x27;doorjambs&#x27; of a door, the upright posts on either side of it which support the lintel, and appears in various contexts unrelated to any religious commandment or parchment. The word later acquired the modern meaning of piece of parchment in post-Biblical Hebrew due to the Deuteronomy commandment above requiring to write verses on doorposts.

The word&#x27;s origin is disputed:

* one accepted understanding derives &quot;mezuzah&quot; from the root (ז-ו-ז) meaning &#x27;motion&#x27; or &#x27;shift&#x27; (), describing a doorpost as the device enabling the door to move or shift. The root is unused in the Bible but is common in post-Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, and is considered to have existed in the language then.
* another accepted understanding derives &quot;mezuzah&quot; from the Akkadian word &quot;mazzāzu&quot; &#x27;stand&#x27; (like the socle or plinth of a column or stele), from the Akkadian verb &quot;izuzzu&quot; &#x27;to stand&#x27;, describing a doorpost as the socle or stand of the entrance, as opposed to the moving part, the door which revolves – a description similar to its corresponding Greek translation in the Septuagint, which in addition to &#x27;doorpost&#x27; generally means &#x27;something fixed, something standing&#x27; from &#x27;to stand&#x27;. However, there is no example of Akkadian &quot;mazzazu&quot; specifically meaning doorpost and some researchers doubt that Hebrew &quot;mezuzah&quot; borrowed this word.

==Purpose==
In the biblical verses where the mezuzah command is found, the purpose is educational, to constantly remind a person of God&#x27;s commandments:
In later generations, though, the mezuzah began to be interpreted as an apotropaic device, protecting the house from forces of evil. A culture-comparative analysis suggests that the objects placed on domestic thresholds often bear the function of an amulet repelling the broadly understood evil. Some early Rabbinic sources (including JT Megillah 4:12, BT Bava Metziya 102a, and BT Pesahim 113b) explicitly witness the belief in the anti-demonic function of mezuzot. While some Jewish sources indicate that mezuzah is construed as a device protecting against divine anger, others vehemently reject such an interpretation.

The belief in the protective power of mezuzah is prevalent in modern times as well. In the 1970s, after a series of terrorist attacks in Ma&#x27;alot, the representatives of Chabad started the campaign for the systematic checking of mezuzahs. The general assumption underlying the action was that adhering to the &quot;mitzvot&quot; would guarantee personal safety.

According to various pieces of sociological research, approximately three-quarters of adults in Israel believe the mezuzah guards their houses.

==Design==
The mezuzah must be written on parchment (klaf) by a specially trained scribe (sofer).

===Additional inscriptions===
It is customary to write two inscriptions on the back of the parchment:
*the Hebrew word (&quot;Shaddai&quot;)
*the phrase &quot;&quot;

&quot;Shaddai&quot;, [&quot;Almighty&quot;] one of the biblical names of God, also serves here as an acronym for &quot;Shomer Daltot Yisrael&quot;, &quot;Guardian of Israel&#x27;s doors&quot;. Many mezuzah cases are also marked with the Hebrew letter (Shin), for &quot;Shaddai&quot;.

&quot;&quot; is a Caesar cipher—a one-letter shift—of the third, fourth, and fifth words of the Shema, &quot;Adonai, Eloheinu, Adonai&quot;, &quot;The Lord, our God, the Lord&quot;; it is written on the back of the case, opposite the corresponding words on the front. This inscription dates from the 11th century and is found among the &quot;Hasidei Ashkenaz&quot; (medieval German Jewish mystics).

The Sephardic custom (minhag) leaves out the phrase , and only the Hebrew word (&quot;Shaddai&quot;) is written on the back of the mezuzah. This follows the Shulchan Aruch and the writings of the Rambam. The Ashkenazi custom of writing both phrases, however, was supported in the writings of the Remo. (Yoreh De&#x27;ah 288:15)

In this regard it is worthwhile to refer to the often cited passage from Rambam&#x27;s &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; which states:

It is a common custom to write [God&#x27;s name,] Shaddai, on the outside of a mezuzah opposite the empty space left between the two passages. There is no difficulty in this, since [the addition is made] outside. Those, however, who write the names of angels, other sacred names, verses, or forms, on the inside [of a mezuzah] are among those who do not have a portion in the world to come. Not only do these fools nullify the mitzvah, but furthermore, they make from a great mitzvah [which reflects] the unity of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, the love of Him, and the service of Him, a talisman for their own benefit. They, in their foolish conception, think that this will help them regarding the vanities of the world.

===Mezuzah cases===
While the most important part of the mezuzah is the &quot;klaf&quot;, or the parchment, and not the case, designing and producing mezuzah cases has been elevated to an art form over the ages. Mezuzah cases are produced from a wide variety of materials, from silver and precious metals, to wood, stone, ceramics, pewter, and even polymer clay. Some dealers of mezuzah cases will provide or offer for sale a copy of the text that has been photocopied onto paper; this is not a kosher (valid) mezuzah, which must be handwritten onto a piece of parchment by a qualified scribe.

==Practices==
===Affixing the mezuzah===
====Position and integrity====
According to &quot;halakha&quot;, the &quot;mezuzah&quot; should be placed on the right side of the door or doorpost, in the upper third of the doorpost (i.e., approximately shoulder height), within approximately of the doorway opening. Care should be taken to not tear or damage the parchment or the wording on it, as this will invalidate the &quot;mezuzah&quot;.

====Angle====
Where the doorway is wide enough, many Ashkenazi Jews tilt the mezuzah so that the top slants toward the room into which the door opens. This is done to accommodate the variant opinions of Rashi (1040–1105) and of his grandson, Rabbeinu Tam, as to whether it should be placed vertically (Rashi) or horizontally (Rabbeinu Tam), and also to imply that God and the Torah (which the mezuzah symbolizes) are entering the room. The compromise solution was suggested by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher ().

Most Sephardi Jews, Mizrahi Jews and other non-Ashkenazi Jews affix the mezuzah vertically, though Spanish and Portuguese Jews living in countries where the majority of Jews are Ashkenazim usually place it slanting.

====Time====
Generally, &quot;halakha&quot; requires Jews living in the diaspora (i.e., outside of the Land of Israel) to affix a &quot;mezuzah&quot; within 30 days of moving into a rented house or apartment. For a purchased home or apartment in the diaspora, or a residence in Israel (owned or rented), the mezuzah is affixed immediately upon moving in. The reason for this difference is that there is an assumption that when a Jew lives in Israel, Israel shall remain their permanent residence, whereas a home in the diaspora is temporary.

====Blessing====
The procedure is to hold the &quot;mezuzah&quot; against the spot upon which it will be affixed, then recite a blessing:
:
:Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His &quot;mitzvot&quot;, and commanded us to affix a &quot;mezuzah&quot;.

Any Jew can recite the blessing, provided they are old enough to understand the significance of the &quot;mitzvah&quot;. After the blessing, the &quot;mezuzah&quot; is attached.

When affixing several &quot;mezuzot&quot;, it is sufficient to recite the blessing once, before affixing the first one.

===Touching the mezuzah===
Whenever passing through the doorway, many people touch a finger to the mezuzah as a way of showing respect to God. Many people also kiss their finger after touching it to the mezuzah.

===Checking the parchment===
Many observant Jews from all Jewish denominations have a qualified scribe check the mezuzot parchments for defects (such as small tears or faded lettering) at least twice every seven years. This job can be done by a sofer (scribe) or by anyone with similar training. A sofer also can make new mezuzot parchments which are in accordance with Jewish law.

==Karaite and Samaritan mezuzah==
This article deals mainly with the &quot;mezuzah&quot; as it is used in Rabbinic Judaism, but Karaite Judaism and Samaritanism have their own traditions.
In Karaite Judaism the Deuteronomic verse &quot;And you shall write them on the doorposts of your houses and your gates&quot; () is interpreted to be a metaphor and not as referring to the Rabbanite &quot;mezuzah&quot;. Thus Karaites do not traditionally use &quot;mezuzot&quot;, but put up a small plaque in the shape of the two Tablets of the Law with the Ten Commandments. In Israel, where they might try not to make other Jews feel uncomfortable, many Karaites make an exception and place a mezuzah on their doorpost as well. The Karaite version of the &quot;mezuzah&quot; is fixed to the doorways of public buildings and sometimes to private buildings, too.

The Samaritans interpret the deuteronomic commandment to mean displaying any select text from the Samaritan version of the five Books of Moses. This can contain a blessing or a particularly holy or uplifting message. In the past they placed a stone plaque inscribed with the Ten Commandments above the house door, some examples dating back to the Byzantine (4th–7th century) and Early Muslim (7th–11th century) periods being now shown in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

Nowadays a Samaritan &quot;mezuzah&quot; is usually made of either marble, a wooden plate, or a sheet of parchment or high quality paper, on which they inscribe select verses from the Samaritan Torah. This they place either above the house door, or inside the house, in the entrance hall or at a prominent place on a large wall. These &quot;mezuzot&quot; are found in every Samaritan household as well as in the synagogue. Today some Samaritans would also use a Jewish-style mezuzah case and place inside it a small written Samaritan scroll, i.e. a text from the Samaritan Torah, written in the Samaritan alphabet. The more such &quot;mezuzot&quot; there are in the house, the better it is considered to be.

==Legal battles in the U.S.==
The Jewish practice of affixing a mezuzah to the entranceway of a residential unit was rarely challenged in the United States or Canada, However, in Chicago in 2001, a condominium association at Shoreline Towers banned &quot;mats, boots, shoes, carts or objects of any sort… outside unit entrance doors&quot;, which by board vote in 2004 was interpreted to be absolute. Shoreline Towers management removed the hallway mezuzot of condominium tenants. Complaints were subsequently filed with the Chicago Commission on Human Relations, Illinois Attorney General, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleging housing discrimination on the basis of religion. Shoreline Towers was not the sole condominium association in Chicago with such a restriction, although one of them agreed to modify its rule.

On reading a news report of the mezuzah dispute, Chicago alderman Burton Natarus drafted an amendment to the city&#x27;s municipal code which made it illegal for a renter or owner of an apartment, house, or condo to be prohibited from &quot;placing or affixing a religious sign, symbol or relic on the door, door post or entrance.&quot; Although there was opposition, it became law in Chicago that December. The first such legislation in North America, it included a maximum $500 fine for its violation.

Notwithstanding this legislation, in 2006, a federal court judge determined that the rule did not violate the Federal Fair Housing Act; the district court upheld the opinion on appeal in 2008; in 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in Chicago reversed the 2008 decision, and the case proceeded. Meanwhile, records of the &quot;Chicago Jewish Star&quot; were unsuccessfully subpoenaed, and Illinois&#x27; anti-SLAPP legislation was applied. In 2011, a confidential settlement to the Shoreline Towers disputes was achieved.

In 2006, a more narrowly focused amendment to the state&#x27;s Condominium Property Act was initiated by Illinois Senator Ira Silverstein, the first such state law.

In 2006, a woman in a condo building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was instructed to remove the mezuzah from her hallway unit and threatened with a fine. After a lengthy legal battle, the condo association was found guilty of discrimination. In 2008, House Bill 995, an amendment to the Florida Condominium Act, modeled on the Illinois state legislation, became law.

In Texas in 2007, a couple living in Houston was instructed to &quot;remove the item attached to your door frame&quot; to avoid violating association rules. A legal battle ensued, during which a U.S. District Court judge ruled in 2008 on behalf of the condo association. Subsequently, the couple turned to Texas House of Representatives member Garnet F. Coleman. His bill to protect such religious displays, as introduced in 2009, was not adopted, but in June 2011 a slightly revised version (HB1278) was signed into law by Texas Governor Rick Perry.

A bill designed to prevent mezuzah bans nationwide was proposed in 2008 (H.R. 6932) by U.S. Congressman Jerrold Nadler. It never became law.

<text>Shekhar Kulbhushan Kapur (born 6 December 1945) is an Indian filmmaker. Born into the Anand-Sahni family, Kapur is the recipient of several accolades, including a BAFTA Award, a National Film Award, a National Board of Review Award and three Filmfare Awards, in addition to nomination for a Golden Globe Award.

Kapur became known in Bollywood with his recurring role in the television series &quot;Khandaan&quot;. He then made his directorial debut with cult classic &quot;Masoom&quot; in 1983, before gaining widespread acclaim with &quot;Mr. India&quot; in 1987. He then gained international recognition and acclaim in 1994 with biographical film &quot;Bandit Queen&quot;, based on the infamous Indian bandit and politician Phoolan Devi. The film premiered in the directors&#x27; fortnight section of the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival.

Kapur achieved further international prominence with the 1998 period film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, a fictional account of the reign of British Queen Elizabeth I, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards. He then directed war drama film &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (2002). In 2007, he directed &quot;&quot;, the sequel to his &quot;1998 film&quot;. 

Shekhar Kapur was awarded Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third highest civilian award, in 2025.

== Early life and education ==
Shekhar was born on 6 December 1945 in Lahore, Punjab, British India, in a Punjabi Hindu family to Kulbhushan Kapoor, a doctor with a flourishing practice, and his wife Sheel Kanta Kapoor.

While on a train from the newly created Pakistan to India, a massacre took place; Kapur&#x27;s mother Sheel played dead and hid both himself and his sister under her body. Reflecting on this, Kapur stated that the partition of India happened through &quot;the blood of one people&quot;.

The nephew of famous Indian actor Dev Anand, he was discouraged from getting into films by his father. Sheel Kanta was the sister of actors Chetan, Dev and Vijay Anand. Kapur is the only son of his parents and he has three sisters. One of his sisters, Neelu, was the first wife of actor Navin Nischol, while another sister, Aruna, is the wife of actor Parikshit Sahni. His third and youngest sister is Sohaila Kapur.

Kapur attended Modern School of New Delhi. He studied economics at St. Stephen&#x27;s College. At 22, he became a Chartered Accountant with the ICAEW in England, having studied accountancy at the behest of his parents. He then started his career working with a multinational oil company. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1970, and spent several years working as an accountant and management consultant.

== Filmmaking career ==

=== In India ===

He turned director with the family drama &quot;Masoom&quot; (1983), starring Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and a young Jugal Hansraj and Urmila Matondkar. The plot followed the story of an illegitimate boy who struggles to find acceptance from his stepmother. He then directed the 1987 science-fiction film &quot;Mr. India&quot;, starring Anil Kapoor, Sridevi and Amrish Puri in his most famous role as the villain Mogambo. Puri&#x27;s most famous dialogue in this film &quot;Mogambo Khush Hua&quot; is still remembered. In 1994 he directed the critically acclaimed &quot;Bandit Queen&quot; and played a cameo in the film as a truck driver.

Kapur was infamous for abandoning several films he was originally the director of. He was originally the director of the 1989 film &quot;Joshilaay&quot;, which starred Sunny Deol, Anil Kapoor, Sridevi and Meenakshi Sheshadri before leaving the production halfway, and its producer Sibti Hassan Rizvi stepped in to complete the film. In 1992, he had shot some scenes for &quot;Barsaat&quot;, which was originally titled &quot;Champion&quot; and was going to be the debut film of Bobby Deol, but he left the production and was replaced by Rajkumar Santoshi. In 1995, he partly directed &quot;&quot;, starring Sunny Deol, Jackie Shroff and Manisha Koirala before its producer Bunty Soorma stepped in to complete the film.

Kapur was the executive producer of the film &quot;The Guru&quot;. He established an Indian film company with Ram Gopal Verma and Mani Ratnam, though the group has thus far produced only one film, &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998), starring Shahrukh Khan and Manisha Koirala. Kapur executive-produced the Bollywood-themed musical &quot;Bombay Dreams&quot; by Andrew Lloyd Webber, which ran in London&#x27;s the West End and on Broadway in New York City for 1 year.

In 2016, Kapur delivers an autobiographical film and documentary about Amma, well known as Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, called &quot;The Science of Compassion&quot;.

=== International ===
In 1998, he received international recognition for the second time after &quot;Bandit Queen&quot;, when he directed the Academy Award-winning period film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, a fictional account of the reign of British Queen Elizabeth I nominated for seven Oscars. The 2007 sequel, &quot;&quot;, was nominated for two Oscars. He was accused of being anti-British by British tabloids for his portrayal of the British Army in the 2002 movie &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;. However, he denied the accusations and stated that he was merely &quot;anti-colonisation&quot;.

=== Future projects ===
It was announced in March 2019 that Kapur will be directing a TV series for Endemol Shine based on historical novels by Amitav Ghosh, known as the &quot;Ibis Trilogy&quot;, which details the opium wars among Britain, India and China in the mid-19th century.

Kapur is all set to adapt Amish Tripathi&#x27;s critically acclaimed book series Shiva Trilogy into a television web show. He will be co-directing the show with Suparn Verma.

==Other ventures==
Kapur started his career as an actor in the movie (1975) starring Prem Kishen and Trilok Kapoor and later in &quot;Toote Khilone&quot;, in Bollywood. He appeared in several Hindi television dramas, such as &quot;Udaan (Doordarshan)&quot;, opposite Kavita Chaudhary, &quot;Upanyaas&quot; (Doordarshan) opposite Nisha Singh, and &quot;Masoom&quot; opposite Neena Gupta.

He served as judge on the reality TV series &quot;India&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, aired on Colors.

In an unusual role for him, Kapur provided the voice of Mohandas Gandhi in the Charkha Audiobooks title of &quot;The Story of My Experiments with Truth&quot;, alongside Nandita Das as narrator.

In 2013, Kapur hosted the TV show on ABP News. On the show, which aims to bring never-seen-before facets of Indian history, he was the narrator.

===Comic book publishing===

In 2006, Kapur formed Liquid Comics and Virgin Animation, an entertainment company focused on creating new stories and characters for a global audience. The Shakti titles of Kapur and Deepak Chopra&#x27;s company debuted with &quot;Devi&quot; and &quot;The Sadhu&quot;. &quot;Devi&quot; is about &quot;a fierce feminine warrior, stronger than the Gods themselves ... a champion of the heavens, and the protector of man&quot;, while &quot;The Sadhu&quot; &quot;is about one man&#x27;s choice between his spiritual oath and his human instinct.&quot;

==Unrealized projects==
== Personal life ==
Kapur had a relationship for seven years with actress Shabana Azmi. He first was married to Medha Gujral, niece of former Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral. They divorced in 1994. She died on 25 November 2014 at a hospital in New York City of liver failure following a second heart and first kidney transplant. Kapur later married actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthi in 1999. They have a daughter named Kaveri Kapur. The couple divorced in 2007.

In March 2020, Krishnamoorthi filed a case against Kapur over a property dispute concerning their daughter Kaveri. She claimed that the property rightfully belongs to their daughter, but has been rented to actor Kabir Bedi and his wife Parveen.

==Filmography==

== Awards and honours ==
In 2000, he received Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India. In 2010, he served as one of the Jury Members in international competition at the 63rd Cannes Film Festival. In 2020, Kapur became the president of the Film and Television Institute of India.

In 2023, Kapur served as the chairperson of the International competition Jury at the 54th International Film Festival of India held from 20 November to 28 November.

<doc id="232225" wikidata="Q2899553" url="?curid=232225" title="Lingua Franca (magazine)">
<text>Lingua Franca was an American magazine about intellectual and literary life in academia.

==Founding==
The magazine was founded in 1990 by Jeffrey Kittay, an editor and professor of French literature at Yale University. Kittay, as the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;saw a niche for vivid reporting about the academic world and especially about its many personal feuds and intellectual controversies.&quot; Kittay told the newspaper, &quot;I was an academic who was very, very hungry for information about what made my profession so alive, where people became passionate about abstract ideas.&quot; Describing the magazine&#x27;s impact years later, in the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, Ron Rosenbaum wrote that &quot;It soon became a much-talked-about phenomenon inside and outside academia.&quot; In November, 2000, on the journal&#x27;s tenth anniversary, the &quot;Village Voice&quot; commented that &quot;&quot;Lingua Franca&quot;&#x27;s influence on nineties magazine culture has been so strong, it&#x27;s sometimes hard to remember that it was unique in academia when it began.&quot;

==Contents and contributors==
In a 2002 retrospective article, Andrew Delbanco wrote about the magazine that &quot;It ran stories about everything, from a historians&#x27; quarrel over the efficacy of the 1960s student movement, to a dispute among anthropologists over whether cannibalism ever existed, to the fight between the Harvard biologists E.O. Wilson and Richard Lewontin over the extent to which genes control human behavior, to the question of whether dissertation advisers should sleep with their students.&quot;

Contributors included editors and writers who went on to careers at &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;The London Review of Books&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: Peter Beinart, Lev Grossman, Fred Kaplan, Robert S. Boynton, Warren St. John, Jonathan Mahler, Jennifer Schuessler, Matthew Steinglass, Daniel Mendelsohn, Laura Secor, Hillary Frey, Lawrence Osborne, Caleb Crain, Rachel Donadio, Jeet Heer, Corey Robin, Chris Mooney, James Ryerson, Emily Nussbaum, Clive Thompson, and Adam Shatz. As cultural critic Ron Rosenbaum wrote in &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, &quot;The kind of writing about ideas that once found a home at &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; has since — with the assistance of many talented &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; alumni, both writers and editors — succeeded in changing the face of serious journalism for the better.&quot;

==Editors==
Jeffrey Kittay served as the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief. For its first year, the editor was Peter Edidin. From 1991 to 1994, &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; was co-edited by Judith Shulevitz and Margaret Talbot. In late 1994, Alexander Star became the editor, joined by Emily Eakin. The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic A.O. Scott served as a senior editor, as did &quot;New Yorker&quot; features editor Daniel Zalewski. Historian and journalist Rick Perlstein, the author of &quot;Nixonland&quot;, began his journalism career as an intern there, later becoming associate editor.

==Sokal Affair==
&quot;Lingua Franca&quot; was where the Sokal Affair — a parody of academic practices and post-structuralist language — was first revealed; &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; editors later produced a book of selected papers on the subject, &quot;The Sokal Hoax&quot;, published by the University of Nebraska Press.

==Final issue==
The magazine halted publication during the 2001 economic downturn, after a financial backer withdrew support. &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor David Remnick told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;That is terrible. I really enjoyed it — I always found something fascinating to read in that magazine, and not infrequently something that I wish we had had for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.&quot; The company behind the magazine declared bankruptcy in April 2002. Later in 2002, editor Alexander Star assembled an anthology: &quot;Quick Studies: The Best of Lingua Franca&quot;, published by Farrar Straus Giroux.

In 2006, at age 19, Aaron Swartz wrote a program to put up a mirror archive of the magazine on the web.

==Honors==
&quot;Lingua Franca&quot; received the National Magazine Award for General Excellence (under 100,000 circulation) in 1993. The magazine was nominated again in 1994, 1996, 1998, and 1999.

<text>Banrisul is a Brazilian bank. It is the largest bank of Southern Brazil and operates primarily in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), with a network that serves more than 365 cities. It has more than 1,312 service points, over 500 agencies and 593 ATMs in Rio Grande do Sul, in the Federal District and in the states of Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina and São Paulo; besides, it keeps agencies in Miami and Grand Cayman.

==History==
In 1927, with the accomplishment of 1º Congress of Creators, appeared the proposal of the creation of a farm loan bank. The event, carried through with all the pomp and circumstance in the &quot;Sao Pedro Theater&quot;, in Porto Alegre, aimed at to analyze the problems of the state economy, with direct focus on the crisis faced for &quot;charqueadas&quot; and all the production related to the cattle one.

The arguments were strong excessively to pass unobserved for the federal government, and president Washington Luís lowered decree, authorizing the state to create a credit bank. To 10h of day 12 of September 1928, in solemnity that counted on the presence of then the president of the State, Getúlio Vargas, was created the Bank of the Rio Grande do Sul.

With an initial capital of 50 a thousand réis, the main objective of the new institution was to take care of the necessities of credit of the cattle gaucho. As official bank, the state taxation started to soon collect of beginning all, until then received for the &quot;Banco Pelotense&quot; (Pelotense Bank, in English), that later was incorporated by the Banrisul.

In 1969 and 1970, the institution incorporated, respectively, Banco Real de Pernambuco s.a. and the &quot;Banco Sul do Brasil s.a.&quot; (South Bank of Brazil s.a., in English), extending its net until Pernambuco and Ceará, besides extending the number of existing agencies already in Santa Catarina, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The opening of an agency in New York, in 1982, inserted the Banrisul in the group of international operators.

The decade of 1980s marked the beginning of the automation in the services of the bank. The massive investments effected since March 1991 had placed the institution in the vanguard of the banking automation in the State.

In March 1990, the Banrisul got authorization of the Brazilian Central Bank to operate as Commercial bank, with accounts receivables, of mortgage loans and credit, financing and investment.

In 1998, the Banrisul incorporated the agencies of the old &quot;Caixa Econômica&quot; (State Public, in English) saving bank, consolidating its position of bigger net of distribution of the south of the country, besides becoming a retail bank. The actions directed in credit facilities of long stated period had passed to be operated, in 2002, for &quot;Caixa Estadual S.A.&quot; - Agency of Promotion.

==Advertising==
Grêmio, one of the most important soccer teams in Rio Grande do Sul, have been sponsored by Banrisul since 2001. Banrisul also sponsors most of the professional teams of the state, like those in the &quot;Gauchão&quot;.

<text>The Gonorynchiformes are an order of ray-finned fish that includes the important food source, the milkfish (&quot;Chanos chanos&quot;, family Chanidae), and a number of lesser-known types, both marine and freshwater.

The alternate spelling &quot;Gonorhynchiformes&quot;, with an &quot;h&quot;, is frequently seen but not official.

Gonorynchiformes have small mouths and no teeth. They are the sole group in the clade Anotophysi, a subgroup of the superorder Ostariophysi. They are characterized by a primitive Weberian apparatus formed by the first three vertebrae and one or more cephalic ribs within the head. This apparatus is believed to be a hearing organ, and is found in a more advanced and complex form in the related cypriniform fish, such as carp. Also like the cypriniforms, the gonorynchiforms produce a substance from their skin when injured that dissolves into the water and acts an alarm signal to other fish.

== Taxonomy ==
Although many of the families are rather small, there are several fossil genera. This listing of the groups of Gonorynchiformes includes fossil fish with a short description. They are listed in approximate order of how primitive their characteristics are.

The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies the extant taxa in this order as follows, as does &quot;Eschmeyer&#x27;s Catalog of Fishes&quot;:

Order Gonorynchiformes 
* Family Chanidae (milkfishes)
* Family Gonorynchidae (beaked sandfishes)
* Family Kneriidae (shellears)
* Family Phractolaemidae (snake mudheads)

<text>An Aeolian harp (also wind harp) is a musical instrument that is played by the wind. Named after Aeolus, the ancient Greek god of the wind, the traditional Aeolian harp is essentially a wooden box including a sounding board, with strings stretched lengthwise across two bridges. It is often placed in a slightly opened window where the wind can blow across the strings to produce sounds. The strings can be made of different materials (or thicknesses) and all be tuned to the same pitch, or identical strings can be tuned to different pitches. Besides being the only string instrument played solely by the wind, the Aeolian harp is also the only string instrument that plays solely harmonic frequencies. They are recognizable by the sound which is a result of this property, which has been described as eerie and ethereal.

The Aeolian harp – already known in the ancient world – was first described by Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) in his books &quot;Musurgia Universalis&quot; (1650) and &quot;Phonurgia Nova&quot; (1673). It became popular as a household instrument during the Romantic era, and Aeolian harps are still hand-crafted today. Some are now made in the form of monumental metal sound sculptures located on the roofs of buildings and windy hilltops.

The quality of sound depends on many factors, including the lengths, gauges, and types of strings, the character of the wind, and the material of the resonating body. Metal-framed instruments with no sound board produce a music very different from that produced by wind harps with wooden sound boxes and sound boards. There is no percussive aspect to the sound like that produced by a wind chime; rather crescendos and decrescendos of harmonic frequencies are played in rhythm to the winds. As Aeolian harps are played without human intervention, the sounds they produce are an example of aleatoric music.

Aside from varying in material, Aeolian harps come in many different shapes. Some resemble standard harps, others box zithers, others lyres, and, in one monument, a fiddle. More modern Aeolian harps can more closely resemble lawn ornaments than any traditional string instrument. The unifying characteristic between all Aeolian harps, regardless of appearance, is their source of sound, the strings, and the fact they are played by the wind. This distinguishes Aeolian harps from other instruments played by the wind, such as wind chimes.

== Operation ==

The harp is driven by the von Kármán vortex street effect. The motion of the wind across a string causes periodic vortices downstream, and this alternating vortex causes the string to vibrate. Lord Rayleigh first solved the mystery of the Aeolian harp in a paper published in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; in 1915. The effect can sometimes be observed in overhead utility lines, fast enough to be heard or slow enough to be seen. Similar taut wires like non-telescoping radio antennae, ships&#x27; anchor lines, and stiff rods also exhibit this phenomenon.

The effect results in Aeolian harps only producing overtones. Were the strings plucked, they would produce the fundamental frequency in addition to several overtones. When the string oscillates due to the wind, though, it always does so in fractions such as halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, and so on. This naturally produces overtones, most commonly the third, octave, and twelfth, without resulting in the fundamental frequency being played.

== Construction ==
An Aeolian harp can, in concept, be constructed from as little as a single taut string. Most household Aeolian harps are made of wood, featuring a sound board and sound hole to improve how the instrument resonates. In terms of size, they are usually about one metre by 13 centimetres by 8 centimetres, with ten to twelve gut strings stretched over two bridges. On some Aeolian harps, all the strings are tuned to the same frequency, as the wind will already influence the pitch by yielding different overtones depending on its intensity. Other Aeolian harps have differently tuned strings, which enable them to produce chords. Aeolian harps lend themselves to being tuned to a major or minor pentatonic scale and octaves of the notes within, as all intervals in these scales are at least moderately consonant. This way, no matter how the wind strikes the strings, the resulting music will be euphonious.

There are more challenges with designing a larger Aeolian harp. For one, a sound chamber at such sizes takes much more material to make. Instead of making a large sound chamber, designers of Aeolian harps approaching seven meters in height use different mechanisms to increase the volume of their instruments. At these heights, they usually prefer upright designs, which allow the instrument to catch more wind for a louder sound. To this same end, Aeolian harps can be placed in the way of natural wind tunnels or have wind scoops to direct more airflow over the strings. In one case, large metal dishes have even been used as amplification devices. For a building material, metal is generally preferred to wood at this scale due to how metal can withstand the environment for longer, needs less maintenance, and is stabler and stronger than wood.

== History ==
The ability of the wind to play string instruments has been known and referenced since ancient times. Aeolian harps have been found in China, Ethiopia, Greece, India, Indonesia, and Melanesia.

== Prevalence ==
Aside from famous Aeolian harp monuments, many can be found along isolated expanses of the European coast in countries such as Denmark, Germany, and Sweden, where they are played by strong ocean winds. Recently, they have become more popular as lawn and window ornaments.

== In literature and music ==

=== Literature ===
The Aeolian harp has a long history of being associated with the numinous, perhaps for its vibrant timbres that produce an ethereal sound. Homer relates that Hermes invented the lyre from dried sinews stretched over a tortoise shell. It was able to be played by the wind. The same is said of the lyre of King David, which was played by a wind sent from God.

Aeolian harps have been featured and mentioned in a number of poems. These include at least four Romantic-era poems: &quot;The Eolian Harp&quot; and &quot;Dejection, an Ode&quot;, both by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and &quot;Mutability&quot; and &quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot; by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The former of these two appears alongside his essay &quot;A Defence of Poetry&quot;. Henry David Thoreau also wrote a poem called &quot;Rumors from an Aeolian Harp&quot;, which he included in the &quot;Monday&quot; chapter of his first book, &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot;.

Aeolian harps have also been mentioned in several novels. These include George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1871–72), Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; (1880) and &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1886), and Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955). James Joyce had a short section &quot;O, Harp Eolian!&quot; in the Aeolus chapter of &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922). More recently, an Aeolian harp was also featured in Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1964 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; to make a cave seem haunted. In William Heinesen&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lost Musicians&quot; (1950), set in Tórshavn, character Kornelius Isaksen takes his three sons to a little church where, in the tower, they sit listening to the &quot;capriciously varying sounds of an Aeolian harp&quot;, which leads the boys into a lifelong passion for music. &quot;El arpa eólica&quot; (&quot;The Aeolian Harp&quot;) is an alternate history novelette written by Óscar Esquivias. It was originally published in 2011 by Fábulas de Albión. The novelette depicts the life of Berlioz as a young student in Paris.

=== Music===
Imitations of the Aeolian harp have been present in classical music since at least the early nineteenth century. Builders of pipe organs have included stops intended to imitate the sound and timbre of the Aeolian harp. German builders were the first to include such a stop from the 1820s. The organ stop labeled &quot;aeolian harp&quot; is not a harp – it does not use a vibrating string – it is simply a rank of low-air-pressure pipes, voiced to imitate the sound of the real aeolian harp. It is, therefore, classified as a string stop. The &quot;aeolian&quot; stops are among the softest found on pipe organs.
A number of classical pieces have been compared to the sounds of the Aeolian harp. One of the oldest has to be the Étude in A-flat major Op. 25, No. 1 for piano (1836) by Frédéric Chopin, which is sometimes called the &quot;Aeolian Harp etude&quot;. This nickname was not Chopin&#x27;s own, being given to it by Robert Schumann. The piece features a delicate, tender, and flowing melody in the fifth finger of the pianist&#x27;s right hand, over a background of rapid pedaled arpeggios as the free resonances of the pedal-lifted strings flow air-like. A piece written to imitate the instrument&#x27;s sounds is Sergei Lyapunov&#x27;s &quot;12 études d&#x27;exécution transcendante&quot;, Op. 11, No. 9, written between 1897 and 1905, which is named by the author (Aeolian harps). In this virtuoso piece, the tremolo accompaniment seems to imitate the sound of the instrument. In classical harp repertoire, an example of such imitation (mostly employing glissandi and arpeggios) is &quot;La harpe éolienne&quot; by Félix Godefroid. Later, Henry Cowell&#x27;s &quot;Aeolian Harp&quot; (1923) was one of the first piano pieces to feature extended techniques on the piano that included plucking and sweeping the pianist&#x27;s hands directly across the strings of the piano.

The Aeolian harp&#x27;s sounds have also been sought after in more recent music. In 1972, Chuck Hancock and Harry Bee recorded a giant Aeolian harp designed and built by 22-year-old Thomas Ward McCain on a hilltop in Chelsea, Vermont. United released their double LP titled &quot;The Wind Harp: Song from the Hill&quot;. An excerpt of this recording appears in the movie &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. The harp was destroyed in a hurricane, but it was rebuilt and now resides in Hopkinton, New Hampshire.

Australian artist, composer and sound sculptor Alan Lamb has created and recorded several very large-scale Aeolian harps, and Roger Winfield&#x27;s album &quot;Windsongs&quot; was &quot;created using an orchestra of eight aeolian harps played entirely by the wind.&quot; (Discogs) In the spirit of this, in 2003 an Aeolian harp was constructed at the Burning Man festival.

The Aeolian harp is especially common in modern music being sampled as a backing track for its eerie, exotic, and unique sound. On his album &quot;Dis&quot; (1976), jazz saxophonist Jan Garbarek used as a background sound recordings of an Aeolian harp, designed and built by Sverre Larssen (1916–1983), that was situated at a Norwegian fjord. British producer Bonobo also sampled an Aeolian harp on his album &quot;Black Sands&quot; (2010).
== Monumental Aeolian harps ==

In recent history, a number of Aeolian harps exceeding six metres in height have been constructed. Aeolian harps of this size are normally made from metal.

In Negrar, in the province of Verona (Italy), is a modern monument Aeolian harp more than six metres high. It is a sound monument designed by the Italian architect Giuseppe Ferlenga which was inaugurated in November 2015 from the Sports and Cultural Group of Mazzano. The acoustic part of this tool is composed of a frame that contains a copper harmonic case. The Aeolian Harp of Negrar has six strings of different lengths and materials. If there is wind, this monumental harp produces audible sounds up to a distance of about four metres.

There are many more Aeolian harps of this size and larger in North America. In the Mimbres Valley of New Mexico, there is an Aeolian harp, titled &quot;Tempest Song&quot;, exceeding seven metres in height. &quot;Tempest Song&quot; is similar in appearance to a standard harp with 45 strings tuned to the C minor pentatonic scale and a central bearing originally from a semi-truck. It was built by Bob Griesing and Bill Neely in June and July 2000, and at the time was mistakenly declared the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Aeolian Harp&quot;.

An even larger Aeolian harp, measuring eight metres tall, can be found at the Exploratorium, a museum in San Francisco. This harp was built in 1976 by Douglas Hollis, a local artist. Its volume is amplified by two metal disks placed on one side of it. In addition, a natural wind tunnel ensures that enough wind passes over the harp&#x27;s seven high-pitched strings.

In Sydney, Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton is an even larger 18-metre-tall, 10 ton steel Aeolian harp which doubles as the world&#x27;s largest fiddle. It was erected to honour the fiddling traditions and folk music of the region&#x27;s Celtic population. This fiddle, unveiled in 2005, is titled &quot;Fidhael Mhor a&#x27; Ceilidh&quot;, or, in English, &quot;Big Fiddle of the Ceilidh&quot;, &quot;Ceilidh&quot; roughly translating from Gaelic into &quot;visit.&quot; This fiddle is so large it can be seen by ships coming into harbour on the island.

The largest Aeolian harp in the world is the Lucia and Aristides Demetrios Wind Harp in South San Francisco, which stands at 28 metres tall. This Aeolian harp is located a little over 74 metres above sea level, which means it always receives a suitable breeze and that it comes with a panoramic view of South San Francisco and some of the Bay. The instrument which resembles a set of steel beams connected by curved grates, is visible throughout much of the city.

<doc id="232237" wikidata="Q237829" url="?curid=232237" title="Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby">
<text>Edward George Geoffrey Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby (29 March 1799 – 23 October 1869), known as Lord Stanley from 1834 to 1851, was a British statesman and Conservative politician who served three times as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. To date, he is the longest-serving leader of the Conservative Party (1846–68). He is one of only four British prime ministers to have three or more separate periods in office. However, his ministries each lasted less than two years and totalled three years and 280 days. Derby introduced the state education system in Ireland, and reformed Parliament.

Historian Frances Walsh has written that it was Derby:
Scholars long ignored his role but in the 21st century rank him highly among all British prime ministers.

==Early life and education==
Edward Smith-Stanley was born on 19 March 1799 at Knowsley Hall, Lancashire. He was the eldest son of Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, and his wife (and first cousin) Charlotte Margaret Hornby. He was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford. 

The Stanley family, originally bearing the surname Audley, rose to prominence in the 15th century after adopting the name from estates in Staffordshire and Derbyshire. Sir John Stanley solidified the family&#x27;s influence by acquiring Knowsley Hall and during reign of Henry VII, one of his descendants, Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, fought at the Battle of Bosworth Field after which the family was ennobled under the Tudors and the Stanleys became one of the wealthiest and most influential noble families. The family fell under hardship during the English Civil War in which James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby was executed for his loyalty to the Crown in 1651 after the Royalist defeat. The family’s fortunes waned even during the Restoration but rebounded economically due to Liverpool estates, with political prominence resuming under Edward Stanley in the 19th century.

Stanley attended Eton College before moving to Christ Church, Oxford and was slightly ahead of the groups that were associated with the Oxford and Young England movements. During his time at Oxford, the intellectual ferment of his later years had not yet begun, and the university, particularly Christ Church, was marked by camaraderie and fair scholarship rather than essential and practical intellectual activity. Christ Church, at the time under Dean Cyril Jackson had already seen its peak and it was common for students to leave without taking a degree, a path Stanley also followed. However, his academic talent was evident when he won the Chancellor&#x27;s Prize for Latin poetry in 1819 with a poem on Syracuse. This achievement indicates that he could have excelled academically if he had chosen to pursue honours. His time at Oxford reflected a transitional period in the university’s history, lacking the stimulation that defined later decades.

==Early political career, 1822–1852==

=== Member of Parliament ===
In 1822 Edward Stanley, as he was then, was elected to Parliament in the rotten borough of Stockbridge as a Whig, the traditional party of his family. The seat itself was not attained through a family borough but was sold. Previously, the seatcontrolled by a Tory West Indian merchant who sold it to a Whig peer, which was used to nominate Stanley as a member of the House of Commons. Years later, Stanley himself later criticised rotten boroughs, arguing that their representatives, no matter how talented, lacked true legitimacy in the eyes of the people. At the this time, his grandfather, 12th Earl of Derby, was serving in the House of Lords and was alive when his grandson quit the Whigs and became a Tory.

Early in his Parliamentary career, Stanley was noted for wearing the traditional “buff and blue” uniform associated with Whig gentlemen, a style already becoming outdated. In 1824, he undertook a tour of North America, an unusual venture at the time, which reflected on his curiosity and broadening perspective. By 1826, he was elected as the MP for Preston, a seat with family connections but not solely dependent on family influence. Outside politics, he was also known for his passion for sports, a tradition encouraged by his grandfather, who had founded the Oaks horse race.

During the election in Preston in 1826, Stanley received 3,041 votes, defeating his main rival, a Tory Wood, who secured 1,982 votes. Barrie, a naval candidate, polled 1,657 votes, while the prominent radical William Cobbett, garnered only just 995 votes. Cobbett had been backed by a subscription headed by Sir Thomas Beevor of Hargham in Norfolk, aiming to carry Preston, but he finished at the bottom of the poll. Despite their political rivalry, Cobbett rarely made disparaging remarks about Stanley. Stanley, nevertheless, was able to escape the ire of Cobbett&#x27;s critique by running as a moderate reformist. The election was significant due to the wide franchise in the borough, which was essentially household suffrage, allowing a broad base of electors to cast their votes. Stanley’s victory came amid a competitive contest, where he triumphed with a clear majority. 

In the 1820s, the Whigs struggled to hold power and was without a coherent creed or power to implement their policies. For much of their history, they were preoccupied with the issue of Jacobitism and even when that concern faded, they lacked a unified stance. Likewise, the Tories had no strong political doctrine either and was similarly fragmented. In 1821, the Whigs had some common cause with the Tories, particularly on issues like Catholic Emancipation, which had been reaapproached by William Pitt the Younger. In 1824, However, he alienated some of his Whig colleagues by voting against Joseph Hume&#x27;s motion for an investigation into the established Protestant Church of Ireland. Stanley&#x27;s speech pushed the principle that no circumstances should justify interference with private property, particularly funded and commercial property. This stance, which was at odds with the Whig party’s more reformist leanings, indicated a clear departure from the Whigs&#x27; political ideology.

=== In government ===
He lost his seat in 1826. Stanley began to associate with the Tories as the 1820s progressed and in 1827, Stanley joined with George Canning as Under-Secretary for the Colonies, which led to him aligned him more with the Tory cause. He criticised the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel for their treatment of Canning as he began to disdain “Tories of the old school.” By the time he publicly rejected Wellington’s government, Stanley had fully embraced a Tory stance, advocating for a stronger, less reformist political position. When the Whigs returned to power in 1830, Stanley became Chief Secretary for Ireland in Lord Grey&#x27;s Government, and entered the Cabinet in 1831. As Chief Secretary Stanley pursued a series of coercive measures which frequently brought him into conflict with the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Anglesey. In October 1831, Stanley wrote the Stanley Letter, to Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster, establishing the system of National Education in Ireland. This letter remains today the legal basis for the predominant form of primary education in Ireland. In 1833, Stanley moved up to the more important position of Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, overseeing the passage of the Abolition of Slavery Bill.

Stanley, a religiously devout Anglican, broke with the ministry over the reform of the Anglican Church of Ireland in 1834 and resigned from the government. He then formed a group called the &quot;Derby Dilly&quot; and attempted to chart a middle course between what they saw as the increasingly radical Whiggery of Lord John Russell and the conservatism of the Tories. Tory leader Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s turn to the centre with the 1834 Tamworth Manifesto, published three days before Stanley&#x27;s &quot;Knowsley Creed&quot; speech, robbed the Stanleyites of much of the uniqueness of their programme.

The term &quot;Derby Dilly&quot; was coined by Irish Nationalist leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell. Besides Stanley, the other principal members of the Dilly were Sir James Graham, who had resigned as First Lord of the Admiralty; Lord Ripon, who had resigned as Lord Privy Seal; and the Duke of Richmond, who had resigned as Postmaster General. These four ministers had come from notably different political backgrounds—Stanley and Graham were old Whigs, Ripon was a former Canningite Tory prime minister, while Richmond was an arch-conservative Tory who had incongruously found himself in the Grey cabinet.

Although they did not participate in Peel&#x27;s short-lived 1835 ministry, over the next several years they gradually merged into Peel&#x27;s Conservative Party, with several members of the &quot;Derby Dilly&quot; taking prominent positions in Peel&#x27;s second ministry. Joining the Conservatives, Stanley again served as Colonial Secretary in Peel&#x27;s second government in 1841. In 1844 he was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Stanley of Bickerstaffe in his father&#x27;s Barony of Stanley by a Writ of acceleration. He broke with the Prime Minister again in 1845, this time over the repeal of the Corn Laws, and managed to bring the majority of the Conservative Party with him (including, among others, the young Benjamin Disraeli). He thereafter led the protectionist faction of the Conservative Party. In the House of Lords, on 23 November 1847, he accused the Irish Catholic clergy of using the confessional to encourage lawlessness and crime. This was disputed in a series of letters by the coadjutor Bishop of Derry, Edward Maginn. In 1851 he succeeded his father as Earl of Derby.

The party system was in a state of flux when the Conservatives left office in 1846, the outstanding issues being the question of Ireland and the unresolved franchise. The protectionists had a core of leaders, of whom Derby was a leading light.

==Premierships, 1852–1869==
He is the only modern-era prime minister who never enjoyed a parliamentary majority. In his private diary, the Earl of Malmesbury in 1857 commented on Derby&#x27;s failure to exploit the press:
===First government===

Derby formed a minority government in February 1852 following the collapse of Lord John Russell&#x27;s Whig Government. In this new ministry, Benjamin Disraeli was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer. With many senior Conservative ministers having followed Peel, Derby was forced to appoint many new men to the office of the Cabinet, only three were pre-existing Privy Counsellors. When the aged Duke of Wellington, by then very deaf, heard the list of inexperienced cabinet ministers being read aloud in the House of Lords, he gave the government its nickname by shouting &quot;Who? Who?&quot;. From then this government would be known as the &quot;Who? Who?&quot; ministry.

Traditionally Derby&#x27;s ministries were thought in hindsight to have been dominated by Disraeli. However, recent research suggests that this was not always the case, especially in the government&#x27;s conduct of foreign policy. There, Derby and his Foreign Secretaries, Lord Malmesbury and later his son Lord Stanley, pursued a course of action that was aimed at building up power through financial strength, seeking to avoid wars at all costs, co-operating with other powers, and working through the Concert of Europe to resolve diplomatic problems. This contrasted sharply with the policy of military strength and prestige that Disraeli would later pursue, and Derby&#x27;s very different take on foreign policy could be seen as the precursor of &quot;splendid isolation&quot;, as well as the diplomatic settlement of Europe pursued by later Conservatives in the late 19th century and the 1930s.

In the general election of June 1852, the Conservative party under Derby and Disraeli won only 330 seats in the House of Commons—42.9% of the total. Although the Whigs actually won fewer seats—292 seats—there were several small groups in Parliament that might be willing to side with the Whigs on particular issues, including the 38 Conservative members of Parliament who were Peelites, who had already joined with the Whigs in June 1846 to repeal the Corn Laws; the 113 members who were Free Traders and who were interested in eliminating all tariffs on consumer goods; and the 63 members of the Irish Brigade who were interested in the independence of Ireland and Tenant&#x27;s Rights for Irish tenants. Immediately following the election in June 1852, none of these small groups were willing to work with the Whigs to form a government. Accordingly, the Earl of Derby was invited to form a minority government. Derby did so and appointed Disraeli as the new Chancellor of the Exchequer.

As with all minority governments, Derby&#x27;s minority government had a difficult time governing. Their main preoccupation was avoiding any issue which might cause any of the government&#x27;s small components to go over to Whigs and cause a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote. However, the real issues facing Parliament could not be postponed for long, and when Disraeli submitted his first budget to Parliament in December 1852, it proved so unpopular with the Peelites, the Free Traders, and the Irish Brigade that it was voted down in a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote. As a result, Derby&#x27;s minority government fell, making way for a Peelite–Whig coalition under Lord Aberdeen. When Aberdeen&#x27;s administration fell in 1855, Queen Victoria asked Derby to form a government. Much to the consternation of some sections of his party, including Disraeli, Derby declined this offer, believing that he would be in a position to form a stronger government after a short-lived failed administration led by one of the Conservative Party&#x27;s rivals such as Lord John Russell or Lord Palmerston.

===Second government===
In 1858, Derby formed another minority government upon the resignation of Lord Palmerston following a parliamentary defeat to an opposition motion which, in the context of a failed plot to assassinate Napoleon III of France, charged that &quot;the ministry had admitted they sheltered assassins&quot;. Disraeli was again at the Exchequer and Leader of the Commons. Among the notable achievements of this administration was the end of the British East India Company following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which brought India under direct British control for the first time. Once again the government was short-lived, resigning after only one year, having narrowly lost a vote of no-confidence brought by Lord Hartington on behalf of various Whig and Radical factions which had coalesced at the Willis&#x27;s Rooms meetings in St James&#x27;s Street to mark the birth of the Liberal Party. In July 1859, Derby was appointed a Knight of the Garter.

Back in opposition, Derby pursued a strategy of trying to lure the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, away from his more radical colleagues, Lord John Russell in particular. This tactic was thwarted by Russell&#x27;s declining influence and by Chancellor of the Exchequer William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s 1861 budget which united the cabinet and increased divisions amongst the Conservatives. Palmerston continued as Prime Minister until his death in 1865, when he was succeeded by the ineffective Russell.

===Third government===
Derby returned to power for the third and last time in 1866, following the collapse of Lord Russell&#x27;s second government after its failed attempt at further electoral reform. Once again, Disraeli was a leading figure. This administration was particularly notable for the passage of the Reform Act 1867, which greatly expanded the suffrage but which provoked the resignation of three cabinet ministers including the Secretary for India and future three-time Prime Minister, Lord Cranborne (later Lord Salisbury). In early 1868, Derby retired from political life on medical advice, leaving Disraeli to succeed him. In 1869, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in recognition of his former role as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Lancashire Rifle Volunteer Corps on 10 September 1862, beginning a family connection with the regiment that endured for over 100 years.

Derby&#x27;s tenure of 22 years as party leader still stands as the longest in Conservative Party history and indeed the history of any other political party in British history. Only Labour&#x27;s Clement Attlee came close, at 20 years.

During Derby&#x27;s third premiership, a factory Act was passed in 1866 “dealing with uncleanliness, inadequate ventilation, and overcrowding in factories.” The provisions of this Act were extended to other trades in 1867, and as a result of this Act &quot;1,500,000 women and children were admitted to the benefits of the factory laws.&quot; That same year an Act was passed regulating the hours of women workers in every workshop. The Master and Servant Act 1867 was also introduced during his final term.

==Marriage and issue==

Stanley married The Hon. Emma Bootle-Wilbraham, the second daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale, on 31 May 1825. They had six children, half of whom survived to adulthood:

*Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby (21 July 1826 – 21 April 1893), married Lady Mary Sackville-West (daughter of 5th Earl De La Warr) on 5 July 1870, without issue
* Ferdinand Charles (26 – 27 July 1829), died in infancy
* Daughter (born and died 3 May 1832), died in infancy
*Lady Emma Charlotte Stanley (25 December 1835 – 23 August 1928). She married Colonel Sir Patrick Chetwynd-Talbot KCB (son of Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 2nd Earl Talbot) on 11 October 1860. They had eight children.
*Hon. Charles Stanley (born and died 6 August 1838), died in infancy
*Frederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby (15 January 1841 – 14 June 1908), married Lady Constance Villiers (daughter of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon) on 31 May 1864. They had ten children.

==Death==
Lord Derby died at Knowsley Hall on 23 October 1869 at the age of 70. The Countess of Derby died on 26 April 1876.

==Legacy==
Historian David Cannadine argues:
Historian Frances Walsh has written:
The National School system in Ireland, the predominant form of primary school education, was unable to sustain the multi-denominational system set up by Stanley in the Stanley Letter. The letter had tried to deal with the seemingly intractable issue of different Christian religions living together in Ireland, but by the end of the century denominational schools had become the norm.

The former site of Fort Langley, British Columbia was renamed Derby by the Royal Engineers in 1858, apparently in honour of the Earl, who was British Prime Minister at the time. Stanley (sometimes referred to as &quot;Port Stanley&quot;) on East Falkland, capital of the Falkland Islands, is named after Edward Smith-Stanley as are Port Stanley in Ontario, Canada (he did not visit his namesake but he had visited nearby Port Talbot, Ontario during his Canadian/American trip in 1824), as well as the area Stanley in Hong Kong. Stanley was Prime Minister when Queen Victoria opened Wellington College, in Berkshire, a tribute to the Duke of Wellington, where the boarding house Stanley is named after him. The County of Stanley, Queensland, Australia, is named after the Earl. Notably, it contains the important Australian city of Brisbane.

A library book about Smith-Stanley titled &quot;The Earl of Derby&quot;, written by George Saintsbury and published in 1892, was borrowed from the Newtown Library in Wellington, New Zealand, in March 1902 and returned in August 2020 (118 years later) after being discovered in Sydney, Australia. The book was described as being &quot;in OK condition&quot;.

<text>The Vauxhall Slant-4 (or Slant Four) is an inline four-cylinder petrol car engine manufactured by Vauxhall Motors. Unveiled in 1966, it was one of the first production overhead camshaft designs to use a timing belt to drive the camshaft. The Slant-4 block was used as a development mule for the Lotus 900 series of engines. Vauxhall used the engine in a variety of models until production ended in 1983.

==History==
===Design===
The Slant-4 gets its name from the fact that its cylinders are inclined at an angle of approximately 45° from vertical. This layout came about because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There were to be slant-4s and V8s in both petrol and diesel versions, designed under the guidance of Vauxhall&#x27;s then chief engineer, John Alden. Although a V8 petrol prototype and several 4-cylinder diesel prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol engine made it to series production.

The engine has a single overhead camshaft driven by a timing belt. The Slant-4 was one of three engines using this method of driving the camshaft released the same year, the others being the Fiat Twin Cam engine and the Pontiac straight-6 OHC. Prior to 1966, belt-driven camshafts had only appeared in the Glas 1004 series starting in 1962 and in the few Devin-Panhard cars built starting in 1956. The camshaft operated two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined socket head cap screw allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a feeler gauge and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout lowers the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic vehicle bodies to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, with the exception of the exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are &quot;underneath&quot; the slanted cylinders.

===Applications===
Prototype engines were fitted to the FC Victor, and the engine also appeared in the Vauxhall XVR concept car. The first production car to use the engine was the 1967 FD Victor. The original engine capacities were and . For the 1972 launch of the FE Victor, the smaller engine was increased to , and the larger to . Blydenstein Racing developed a long stroke version with a capacity of capable of producing almost . Having been designed to withstand the stresses of diesel compression ignition, the block is immensely strong and able to handle large increases in power without modification. The crank was also designed to be shared with the diesel version, which meant its strength was assured for the petrol version. The larger displacement versions are known for their immense torque, but also as not very smooth running or high-revving. A fuel-injected version of the 2.3-litre engine was planned for both the HP Firenza and VX4/90. Running prototypes were tested before the project was abandoned due to cost and the impending merger of Vauxhall&#x27;s design and engineering pool with that of Opel in Germany.

Apart from its use in passenger cars, the engine was also developed for marine applications. It grew popular with tuners due to its great strength, tunability and simplicity. A 2-litre version of the Slant-4 powered the eight Costin Amigos that were built between 1970 and 1972. The engine remained in production well into the 1980s for the Bedford CF van.

Although arguably more technically advanced, the Slant-4 was considered less reliable than its continental GM counterpart, the Opel CIH (Cam In Head) engine. The Slant-4 was replaced by the CIH in the badge-engineered Vauxhall Cavalier Mk.1s from the mid 1970s onward, whilst the Bedford CF van lost the Slant-4 in favour of the CIH when revised in 1983.

==Engine specifications==
==Lotus 900 series engines==

It is said that when Vauxhall unveiled its new slant-four engine at the 1966 Earls Court Motor Show its bore centers were exactly the same as those proposed by Lotus for their new all-alloy engine. Lotus boss Colin Chapman immediately negotiated a deal with Vauxhall to buy some of their cast-iron blocks so that development of Lotus’ own aluminum 907 engine could be sped up. For racing the hybrid engines were called LV220 and LV240, with LV standing for Lotus/Vauxhall and the numbers standing for the reported horsepower developed by each version. Lotus tested the production intent hybrid engine in a Vauxhall Victor and a Vauxhall Viva GT (registration number RAH 713F), as well as in a converted Bedford CF van.

The Lotus 900 series engine block was cast in aluminium alloy instead of iron, which made it considerably lighter than the Slant-4. The Lotus engine also used a cylinder head of light alloy that featured double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. With a few modifications the Lotus head could be fitted to the Vauxhall block. Engines with Lotus heads were used in Vauxhall&#x27;s dealer team race and rally programmes until the late 1970s.

==Vauxhall 16-valve engines==
After experimenting with an 8-valve twin cam cylinder head, Vauxhall began development of a 16-valve, twin cam head for the Slant-4 in the early 1970s. The first test engine, &#x27;Old Number 1&#x27;, was running by 1973. The cylinder head was similar to the Lotus head in principle, but different in detail; in particular the cam carriers on the Vauxhall engine were angled upwards so that the covers were both horizontal (those on the Lotus engine were equal about the cylinder centreline).

The 16-valve was announced for use in the Chevette 2300 HS, which was immediately homologated for racing by the RAC MSA. Vauxhall&#x27;s own 16-valve head had passed beyond the design stage, but initially was in such short supply that the rally team continued to use the Lotus heads. To address the production shortfall Vauxhall approached Cosworth and had them produce the 400 cylinder heads needed for the racing homologation requirements. When the new Vauxhall heads appeared in the Chevette 2300 HST the other teams complained, which led to a homologation scandal. This in turn led to the cars being prevented from starting the 1978 Rally of Portugal. As a result, all cars competing in international rallies were forced to use the Vauxhall head.

==Motorsports==
Lotus raced the hybrid LV engine in two Lotus 62s for a single season.

While Vauxhall&#x27;s General Motors parent company had a &quot;no racing&quot; policy, the Slant-4 was campaigned in various cars by the independent Dealer Team Vauxhall (DTV) organization. Development of the cars was handled by different groups, including Bill Blydenstein Racing, who ran the rally team and both raced the Lotus-head cars and improved the Vauxhall head to a point where it performed better than the Lotus head. Chris Coburn&#x27;s &quot;Coburn Improvements&quot; also raced under the DTV banner.

<text>The milkfish (Chanos chanos) is a widespread species of ray-finned fish found throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is the sole living species in the family Chanidae, and the only living member of the genus Chanos.
The repeating scientific name (tautonym) is from Greek ( ‘mouth’). They are grouped in the order Gonorhynchiformes and are most closely related to the Ostariophysi—freshwater fishes such as carps, catfish, and loaches. 

The species has many common names. The Hawaiian name for the fish is &quot;awa&quot;, and in Tahitian it is &quot;ava&quot;. It is called &quot;bangús&quot; () in the Philippines, where it is popularly known as the national fish, although the National Commission for Culture and the Arts has stated that this is not the case as it has no basis in Philippine law. In the Nauruan language, it is referred to as . Milkfish is also called &quot;bandeng&quot; or &quot;bolu&quot; in Indonesia. 

The following are common names for milkfish by country: 
==Geographic distribution==

&quot;Chanos chanos&quot; occurs in the Indian Ocean and across the Pacific Ocean, from South Africa to Hawaii and the Marquesas, from California to the Galapagos, north to Japan, south to Australia. A single specimen was reported in 2012 in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. 
In 1877, the California Fish and Game Commission introduced one hundred milkfish from Hawaii to the inland waters of Solano County, California. The introduced population could not establish itself permanently and it’s currently unknown how their presence affected the native ecosystem.

Milkfishes commonly live in tropical offshore marine waters around islands and along continental shelves, at depths of . They also frequently enter estuaries and rivers.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Chanos&quot; is the only surviving genus of the ancient family Chanidae, which has existed since the Early Cretaceous. The only surviving species is the widespread &quot;C. chanos&quot;. Several fossil species of &quot;Chanos&quot; are known from the Paleogene of the Tethys and North Seas, dating as far back as the earliest Eocene. The earliest fossil Chanos were found in freshwater Eocene deposits in Europe and North America—hinting that the species first appeared in freshwater environments 40–50 million years ago. It’s possible that their invasion into the ocean happened during high sea-level or flooding events after the Eocene. Global cooling during the Mid-Eocene likely wiped out the population of milkfish in the Atlantic, but the species persisted in the Indo-Pacific. 

The following fossil species of &quot;Chanos&quot; are known:

* †&quot;C. brevis&quot; - Oligocene of the Chiavon Limestone, Italy
* †&quot;C. compressus&quot; [otolith] - Late Ypresian of the Wittering Formation, England
* †&quot;C. forcipatus&quot; - Late Ypresian of Monte Bolca, Italy
* †&quot;C. torosus&quot; - Earliest Ypresian of the Danata Formation, Turkmenistan
* †&quot;C. zignoi&quot; - Oligocene of the Chiavon Limestone, Italy

The extinct &quot;Caeus leopoldi&quot; from the Early Cretaceous (Albian) of Italy is also sometimes placed in &quot;Chanos&quot; as &quot;Chanos leopoldi&quot;, which would be the earliest record of the genus and extend its occurrence even further back. However, more recent studies have affirmed it being a distinct genus.

== Anatomy ==

The milkfish can grow to , but are most often no more than in length. They can reach a weight of about . and an age of 15 years. They have an elongated and almost compressed body, with a generally symmetrical and streamlined appearance, one dorsal fin, falcate pectoral fins and a sizable forked caudal fin. The head is small relative to the body. The mouth is small and toothless. The body is olive green, with silvery flanks and dark bordered fins. They have 13–17 dorsal soft rays, 8–10 anal soft rays and 31 caudal fin rays. There are numerous fine intramuscular bones, which may complicate human consumption of the fish (see &quot;Consumption&quot; below).

Their silvery complexion is similar to many other fish species of the Indo-Pacific. They are often mistaken for species of Clupeidae, &quot;Megalops cyprinoides&quot;, &quot;Gonorhynchus gonorhynchus&quot;, and &quot;Elops machnata&quot;. &quot;Chanos&quot; can be distinguished from these species by their size, absence of scutes, tubercle on the lower jaw, fin placement, no gular plate between arms of the lower jaw, and having only four branchiostegal rays.

Variant milkfish body types have occasionally been found. The ‘goldfish-type’ milkfish was discovered in the Philippines and is characterized by distinctly elongated dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins, and a caudal fin as long as the body. In Hawaii, Indonesia, and Australia, dwarf or hunchback ‘shad-type’ specimens have been recorded. They have a standard length-to-depth ratio of 2.0-2.5 instead of the usual 3.5-4.0. In Northern Australia, a milkfish with a red head, red fins, and blue dorsal coloration was reported.

==Life history==
Reproduction of milkfish in nature is far less understood than populations of milkfish bred and propagated in captivity (see &quot;Aquaculture&quot; below). In the wild, milkfish take 3–5 years to mature. Females can produce 0.5-6 million eggs and have the ability to spawn more than once a year. Spawning takes place at night, may be lunar periodic, and is strongly seasonal. Milkfish eggs are pelagic and range between in diameter. Spawning sites are clear, warm, shallow waters above sand or coral reefs. It is believed milkfish prefer these locations to minimize predation from benthic planktivores.

Milkfish larvae have a pelagic planktonic stage. Younger larvae occur mostly at the surface, or sometimes deeper (). Older larvae are only found at the surface and in near-shore environments. Larvae metamorphose into fry and become benthic-feeding juveniles that are opportunistically herbivorous, detritivorous, or omnivorous, depending on the predominant food types in the habitat. 

Juvenile milkfish larger than typically bear the characteristics of adults. They have complete fin rays, a forked caudal fin, scales, and silvery coloration. Juveniles have been found to inhabit a diverse range of shallow-water ecosystems such as coral lagoons, estuaries, marsh flats, tidal creeks, and tide pools.

===Diet===
Milkfish are omnivorous opportunistic feeders. Juvenile milkfish eat a variety of foods including phytoplankton, zooplankton, filamentous green algae, and small invertebrates. Similarly to juveniles, adults also eat benthic invertebrates and additionally planktonic and nektonic items such as clupeid juveniles. 

===Habitat===
Adults tend to school around coasts and islands with coral reefs. The young fry live at sea for two to three weeks and then migrate during the juvenile stage to mangrove swamps, estuaries, and sometimes lakes, and return to sea to mature sexually and reproduce. Juveniles prefer to settle in undisturbed coastal ecosystems that are semi-enclosed, calm, shallow, free from predators, and rich in aquatic vegetation. In their natural habitats, milkfish are very adaptable to both changes in environmental conditions and diet. Milkfish are good osmoregulators and extremely euryhaline.

The wide geographic distribution of milkfish has led to genetic variation in the species across the Indo-Pacific. Milkfish populations differ between the Hawaiian islands, the central Pacific islands, Tonga, Tahiti, Philippines-Taiwan-Indonesia, Thailand-Malaysia, India, and Africa. However, all populations are thought to be inter-breeding, thus they are all considered one species, and their genetic diversity is low. However, populations may still differ in their reproductive, migratory, and survival methods.

==Conservation status==
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, milkfish are not currently a threatened species. However, little information is available on wild stocks.

Although milkfish populations are not threatened with extinction, they are at risk of ingesting or absorbing pollutants. Milkfish frequent environments that have been affected by industrial pollutants, land runoff, and plastics. Asia is one of the largest contributors of plastic litter into both the ocean and freshwater systems. A population of milkfish from San Jose, Northern Samar, Philippines was found to have concentrations of lead in the meaty part of their bodies. Pollutants have also impacted the aquaculture industry. In an aquaculture system in Butuan, Philippines, 97% of the fish sampled had microplastics in their gastrointestinal tracts. A similar study in Indonesia showed similar results. The presence of pollutants in milkfish poses a threat to the species’ health, aquaculture, and humans.

==Fishing==
In the Philippines, it is prohibited to fish for adult milkfish, also known as &quot;sabalo&quot;, over . The government enacted this law in 1975 in an effort to protect spawning stocks of fish. However, &quot;sabalo&quot; are incidentally caught in fish corrals and are products of bycatch from fisheries. The ban was reinforced by the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998 and violations are punishable by imprisonment for 6 months to 8 years, and/or a fine of , forfeiture of the catch and fishing equipment used, and revocation of the fishing license. 

== Consumption ==
The milkfish is an important seafood in Southeast Asia and some Pacific Islands. Because it is notorious for being much bonier than other food fish, deboned milkfish, called &quot;boneless &quot;bangús&quot;&quot; in the Philippines, has become popular in stores and markets. Despite the notoriety however, many people in the Philippines continue to enjoy the fish cooked regularly or even raw using kalamansi juice or vinegar to make &quot;kinilaw na bangus&quot;.

Popular presentations of milkfish in Indonesia include &quot;bandeng duri lunak&quot; (soft-boned milkfish, &quot;ikan bandeng&quot; is Indonesian for milkfish) from Central and East Java or &quot;bandeng presto&quot;, which is pressure cooked milkfish until the thorns are rendered tender, and &quot;bandeng asap&quot; or smoked milkfish. Either fresh or processed, milkfish is the popular seafood product of Indonesian fishing towns, such as Juwana near Semarang in Central Java, and Sidoarjo near Surabaya in East Java.

Milkfish is the most popular fish in Taiwanese cuisine; it is valued for its versatility as well as its tender meat and economical price. Popular presentations include as a topping for congee, pan fried, braised, and as fish balls. There is a milkfish museum in Anping District and city of Kaohsiung holds an annual milkfish festival.

Milkfish is an oily fish, and is rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

== Aquaculture ==

=== History ===
Milkfish aquaculture first occurred around 1800 years ago in the Philippines and spread to Indonesia, Taiwan, and into the Pacific. Traditional milkfish aquaculture relied upon restocking ponds by collecting wild fry. This led to a wide range of variability in quality and quantity between seasons and regions.

In the late 1970s, farmers first successfully spawned breeding fish. However, they were hard to obtain and produced unreliable egg viability. In 1980, the first spontaneous spawning happened in sea cages. These eggs were found to be sufficient to generate a constant supply for farms.

Milkfish aquaculture accounts for 14% of all aquaculture production worldwide. Indonesia and the Philippines were the leading producers of the species in 2017. The fish is especially desirable for aquaculture because of their rapid growth rate, disease resistance, acclimation to captivity, low mortality, high market value, and high-quality flesh.

=== Farming methods ===

Fry are raised in either sea cages, large saline ponds (Philippines), or concrete tanks (Indonesia, Taiwan). Milkfish reach sexual maturity at , which takes five years in floating sea cages, but eight to 10 years in ponds and tanks. Once they reach , (eight years), 3–4 million eggs are produced each breeding cycle. This is mainly done using natural environmental cues. However, attempts have been made using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-A) to induce spawning. Some still use the traditional wild stock method — capturing wild fry using nets.
Milkfish hatcheries, like most hatcheries, contain a variety of cultures, for example, rotifers, green algae, and brine shrimp, as well as the target species. They can either be intensive or semi-intensive. Semi-intensive methods are more profitable at per thousand fry in 1998, compared with for intensive methods. However, the experience required by labour for semi-intensive hatcheries is higher than intensive.
Milkfish nurseries in Taiwan are highly commercial and have densities of about 2000/L. Indonesia achieves similar densities, but has more backyard-type nurseries. The Philippines has integrated nurseries with grow-out facilities and densities of about 1000/L. 
The three methods of outgrowing are pond culture, pen culture, and cage culture.
* Shallow ponds are found mainly in Indonesia and the Philippines. These are shallow (), brackish ponds with benthic algae, usually used as feed. They are usually excavated from &quot;nipa&quot; or mangrove areas and produce about per year. Deep ponds () have more stable environments and their use began in 1970. They so far have shown less susceptibility to disease than shallow ponds.
* In 1979, pen culture was introduced in Laguna de Bay, which had high primary production. This provided an excellent food source. Once this ran out, fertilizer was applied. They are susceptible to disease.
* Cage culture occurs in coastal bays. These consist of large cages suspended in open water. They rely largely on natural sources of food.
Most food is natural (known as &quot;lab-lab&quot;) or a combination of phytoplankton and macroalgae. Traditionally, this was made on site; food is now made commercially to order.
Harvest occurs when the individuals are long and in weight. Partial harvests remove uniformly sized individuals with seine nets or gill nets. Total harvest removes all individuals and leads to a variety of sizes. Forced harvest happens when an environmental problem occurs, such as depleted oxygen due to algal blooms, and all stock is removed.
Possible parasites include nematodes, copepods, protozoa, and helminths. Many of these are treatable with chemicals and antibiotics.

===Challenges===
Modern milkfish aquaculture faces some challenges: acquiring viable milkfish fry, overcoming their status as a low-value species, attempting to expand outside of an ethnic market and struggling to find a sustainable cost-production balance. In 1987, Taiwan developed the outdoor hatchery technique, which resulted in lower-cost technology, and their fry production surpassed that of the wild. Since then, Taiwan has been one of the biggest hatchery fry producers in the Indo-Pacific. To stimulate market demand, sellers have been taking a fast-food approach, to make the product more accessible and desirable to common consumers.

=== Processing and marketing ===
Traditional post-harvest processing include smoking, drying, and fermenting. Bottling, canning, and freezing are of recent origin.
Demand has been steadily increasing since 1950. In 2005, were harvested worth US$616 million.

A trend toward value-added products is occurring. In recent years, the possibility of using milkfish juveniles as bait for tuna long-lining has started to be investigated, opening up new markets for fry hatcheries.

=== Golden &quot;bangus&quot; ===
On April 21, 2012, a Filipino fisherman donated a milkfish with yellowish coloring to the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, which was later on called the &quot;golden &quot;bangus&quot;&quot;. However, the fish soon died, allegedly because of a lower level of oxygen in the pond to which it was transferred.

==Cultural significance== 
Milkfish have appeared in the traditions and mythology of the native Pohnpeians, Hawaiians, Tongans, and Nauruans in the Pacific.

===&quot;Bangus&quot; Festival===

In the city of Dagupan in Pangasinan, Philippines, they host an annual &quot;Bangus&quot; Festival. The festival was initially a bangus harvest or ‘&quot;Gilon&quot;’ conceptualized in the 1990s by Mayor Al Fernandez. Now, the festival has become an extravagant event including street dance competitions. The street dance competition named &quot;Gilon-gilon ed Dalan&quot; was established to celebrate the &quot;bangus&quot; harvest. The festival also honors the city’s patron Saint John, who was originally a fisherman and figured prominently in biblical stories of bountiful fish harvests. The Dagupan province is considered the country’s top producer of milkfish cultured in marine cages and pens. Two ‘species’ of milkfish are cultured in the city—the more popular of the two is the Bonuan &quot;Bangus&quot;.

<text>The sacrum (: sacra or sacrums), in human anatomy, is a large, triangular bone at the base of the spine that forms by the fusing of the sacral vertebrae (S1S5) between ages 18 and 30.

The sacrum situates at the upper, back part of the pelvic cavity, between the two wings of the pelvis. It forms joints with four other bones. The two projections at the sides of the sacrum are called the alae (wings), and articulate with the ilium at the L-shaped sacroiliac joints. The upper part of the sacrum connects with the last lumbar vertebra (L5), and its lower part with the coccyx (tailbone) via the sacral and coccygeal cornua.

The sacrum has three different surfaces which are shaped to accommodate surrounding pelvic structures. Overall, it is (curved upon itself). The base of the sacrum, the broadest and uppermost part, is tilted forward as the sacral promontory internally. The central part is curved outward toward the posterior, allowing greater room for the pelvic cavity.

In all other quadrupedal vertebrates, the pelvic vertebrae undergo a similar developmental process to form a sacrum in the adult, even while the bony tail (caudal) vertebrae remain unfused. The number of sacral vertebrae varies slightly. For instance, the S1S5 vertebrae of a horse will fuse, the S1S3 of a dog will fuse, and four pelvic vertebrae of a rat will fuse between the lumbar and the caudal vertebrae of its tail.

The &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; dinosaur had a greatly enlarged neural canal in the sacrum, characterized as a &quot;posterior brain case&quot;.

==Structure==
The sacrum is a complex structure providing support for the spine and accommodation for the spinal nerves. It also articulates with the hip bones. The sacrum has a base, an apex, and three surfaces – a pelvic, dorsal and a lateral surface. The base of the sacrum, which is broad and expanded, is directed upward and forward. On either side of the base is a large projection known as an ala of sacrum and these alae (wings) articulate with the sacroiliac joints. The alae support the psoas major muscles and the lumbosacral trunk which connects the lumbar plexus with the sacral plexus. In the articulated pelvis, the alae are continuous with the iliac fossa. Each ala is slightly concave from side to side, and convex from the back and gives attachment to a few of the fibers of the iliacus muscle. The posterior quarter of the ala represents the transverse process, and its anterior three-quarters the costal process of the first sacral segment. Each ala also serves as part of the border of the pelvic brim. The alae also form the base of the lumbosacral triangle. The iliolumbar ligament and lumbosacral ligaments are attached to the ala.

In the middle of the base is a large oval articular surface, the upper surface of the body of the first sacral vertebra, which is connected with the under surface of the body of the last lumbar vertebra by an intervertebral fibrocartilage. Behind this is the large triangular orifice of the sacral canal, which is completed by the lamina and spinous process of the first sacral vertebra. The superior articular processes project from it on either side; they are oval, concave, directed backward and medialward, like the superior articular processes of a lumbar vertebra. They are attached to the body of the first sacral vertebra and to each ala, by short thick pedicles; on the upper surface of each pedicle is a vertebral notch, which forms the lower part of the foramen between the last lumbar and first sacral vertebrae.

The apex is directed downward and presents an oval facet for articulation with the coccyx. The sacral canal as a continuation of the vertebral canal runs throughout the greater part of the sacrum. The sacral angle is the angle formed by the true conjugate with the two pieces of sacrum. Normally, it is greater than 60 degrees. A sacral angle of lesser degree suggests funneling of the pelvis.

===Promontory===
The sacral promontory marks part of the border of the pelvic inlet, and comprises the iliopectineal line and the linea terminalis. The sacral promontory articulates with the last lumbar vertebra to form the sacrovertebral angle, an angle of 30 degrees from the horizontal plane that provides a useful marker for a sling implant procedure.

===Surfaces===
The pelvic surface of the sacrum is concave from the top, and curved slightly from side to side. Its middle part is crossed by four transverse ridges, which correspond to the original planes of separation between the five sacral vertebrae. The body of the first segment is large and has the form of a lumbar vertebra; the bodies of the next bones get progressively smaller, are flattened from the back, and curved to shape themselves to the sacrum, being concave in front and convex behind. At each end of the transverse ridges, are the four anterior sacral foramina, diminishing in size in line with the smaller vertebral bodies. The foramina give exit to the anterior divisions of the sacral nerves and entrance to the lateral sacral arteries. Each part at the sides of the foramina is traversed by four broad, shallow grooves, which lodge the anterior divisions of the sacral nerves. They are separated by prominent ridges of bone which give origin to the piriformis muscle. If a sagittal section be made through the center of the sacrum, the bodies are seen to be united at their circumferences by bone, wide intervals being left centrally, which, in the fresh state, are filled by the intervertebral discs.

The dorsal surface of the sacrum is convex and narrower than the pelvic surface. In the middle line is the median sacral crest, surmounted by three or four tubercles—the rudimentary spinous processes of the upper three or four sacral vertebrae. On either side of the median sacral crest is a shallow sacral groove, which gives origin to the multifidus muscle. The floor of the groove is formed by the united laminae of the corresponding vertebrae. The laminae of the fifth sacral vertebra, and sometimes those of the fourth, do not meet at the back, resulting in a fissure known as the sacral hiatus in the posterior wall of the sacral canal. The sacral canal is a continuation of the spinal canal and runs throughout the greater part of the sacrum. Above the sacral hiatus, it is triangular in form. The canal lodges the sacral nerves, via the anterior and posterior sacral foramina.

On the lateral aspect of the sacral groove is a linear series of tubercles produced by the fusion of the articular processes which together form the indistinct medial sacral crest. The articular processes of the first sacral vertebra are large and oval-shaped. Their facets are concave from side to side, face to the back and middle, and articulate with the facets on the inferior processes of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

The tubercles of the inferior articular processes of the fifth sacral vertebra, known as the sacral cornua, are projected downward and are connected to the cornua of the coccyx. At the side of the articular processes are the four posterior sacral foramina; they are smaller in size and less regular in form than those at the front, and transmit the posterior divisions of the sacral nerves. On the side of the posterior sacral foramina is a series of tubercles, the transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae, and these form the lateral sacral crest. The transverse tubercles of the first sacral vertebra are large and very distinct; they, together with the transverse tubercles of the second vertebra, give attachment to the horizontal parts of the posterior sacroiliac ligaments; those of the third vertebra give attachment to the oblique fasciculi of the posterior sacroiliac ligaments; and those of the fourth and fifth to the sacrotuberous ligaments.
The lateral surface of the sacrum is broad above, but narrows into a thin edge below. The upper half presents in front an ear-shaped surface, the auricular surface, covered with cartilage in the immature state, for articulation with the ilium. Behind it is a rough surface, the sacral tuberosity, on which are three deep and uneven impressions, for the attachment of the posterior sacroiliac ligament. The lower half is thin, and ends in a projection called the inferior lateral angle. Medial to this angle is a notch, which is converted into a foramen by the transverse process of the first piece of the coccyx, and this transmits the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve. The thin lower half of the lateral surface gives attachment to the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments, to some fibers of the gluteus maximus at the back and to the coccygeus in the front.

=== Articulations ===

The sacrum articulates with four bones:
* the last lumbar vertebra above
* the coccyx (tailbone) below
* the ilium portion of the hip bone on either side

Rotation of the sacrum superiorly and anteriorly whilst the coccyx moves posteriorly relative to the ilium is sometimes called &quot;nutation&quot; (from the Latin term which means &quot;nodding&quot;) and the reverse, postero-inferior motion of the sacrum relative to the ilium whilst the coccyx moves anteriorly, &quot;counter-nutation&quot;.
In upright vertebrates, the sacrum is capable of slight independent movement along the sagittal plane. On bending backward the top (base) of the sacrum moves forward relative to the ilium; on bending forward the top moves back.

The &quot;sacrum&quot; refers to all of the parts combined. Its parts are called &quot;sacral vertebrae&quot; when referred individually.

=== Variations ===
In some cases, the sacrum will consist of six pieces or be reduced in number to four. The bodies of the first and second vertebrae may fail to unite.

===Development===
The somites that give rise to the vertebral column begin to develop from head to tail along the length of the notochord. At day 20 of embryogenesis, the first four pairs of somites appear in the future occipital bone region. Developing at the rate of three or four a day, the next eight pairs form in the cervical region to develop into the cervical vertebrae; the next twelve pairs will form the thoracic vertebrae; the next five pairs the lumbar vertebrae and by about day 29, the sacral somites will appear to develop into the sacral vertebrae; finally on day 30, the last three pairs will form the coccyx.

==Clinical significance==

===Congenital disorders===
The congenital disorder, spina bifida, occurs as a result of a defective embryonic neural tube, characterised by the incomplete closure of vertebral arch or of the incomplete closure of the surface of the vertebral canal. The most common sites for spina bifida malformations are the lumbar and sacral areas.

Another congenital disorder is that of caudal regression syndrome also known as &quot;sacral agenesis&quot;. This is characterised by an abnormal underdevelopment in the embryo (occurring by the seventh week) of the lower spine. Sometimes part of the coccyx is absent, or the lower vertebrae can be absent, or on occasion a small part of the spine is missing with no outward sign.

=== Fracture ===

Sacral fractures are relatively uncommon; however, they are often associated with neurological deficits. In the presence of neurological signs, they are mostly treated with surgical fixation.

===Cancer===
The sacrum is one of the main sites for the development of the sarcomas known as chordomas that are derived from the remnants of the embryonic notochord.

==Other animals==
In dogs, the sacrum is formed by three fused vertebrae. The sacrum in the horse is made up of five fused vertebrae. In birds, the sacral vertebrae are fused with the lumbar and some caudal and thoracic vertebrae to form a single structure called the synsacrum. In the frog, the ilium is elongated and forms a mobile joint with the sacrum that acts as an additional limb to give more power to its leaps.

==History==
English &quot;sacrum&quot; was introduced as a technical term in anatomy in the mid-18th century, as a shortening of the Late Latin name &quot;os sacrum&quot; &quot;sacred bone&quot;, itself a translation of Greek ἱερόν ὀστέον, the term found in the writings of Galen. Prior to the adoption of &quot;sacrum&quot;, the bone was also called &quot;holy bone&quot; in English, paralleling German &quot;heiliges Bein&quot; or &quot;Heiligenbein&quot; (alongside &quot;Kreuzbein&quot;) and Dutch &quot;heiligbeen&quot;.

The origin of Galen&#x27;s term is unclear. Supposedly the sacrum was the part of an animal offered in sacrifice (since the sacrum is the seat of the organs of procreation). Others attribute the adjective ἱερόν to the ancient belief that this specific bone would be indestructible. As the Greek adjective ἱερός may also mean &quot;strong&quot;, it has also been suggested that &quot;os sacrum&quot; is a mistranslation of a term intended to mean &quot;the strong bone&quot;. This is supported by the alternative Greek name μέγας σπόνδυλος by the Greeks, translating to &quot;large vertebra&quot;, translated into Latin as &quot;vertebra magna&quot;.

In Classical Greek the bone was known as κλόνις (Latinized &quot;clonis&quot;); this term is cognate to Latin &quot;clunis&quot; &quot;buttock&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;&quot; &quot;haunch&quot; and Lithuanian &quot;šlaunis&quot; &quot;hip, thigh&quot;. The Latin word is found in the alternative Latin name of the sacrum, &quot;ossa clunium&quot;, as it were &quot;bones of the buttocks&quot;. Due to the fact that the os sacrum is broad and thick at its upper end, the sacrum is alternatively called &quot;os latum&quot;, &quot;broad bone&quot;.

<text>A crystal radio receiver, also called a crystal set, is a simple radio receiver, popular in the early days of radio. It uses only the power of the received radio signal to produce sound, needing no external power. It is named for its most important component, a crystal detector, originally made from a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena. This component is now called a diode.

Crystal radios are the simplest type of radio receiver and can be made with a few inexpensive parts, such as a wire for an antenna, a coil of wire, a capacitor, a crystal detector, and earphones (because a crystal set has insufficient power for a loudspeaker). However they are passive receivers, while other radios use an amplifier powered by current from a battery or wall outlet to make the radio signal louder. Thus, crystal sets produce rather weak sound and must be listened to with sensitive earphones, and can receive stations only within a limited range of the transmitter.

The rectifying property of a contact between a mineral and a metal was discovered in 1874 by Karl Ferdinand Braun. Crystals were first used as a detector of radio waves in 1894 by Jagadish Chandra Bose, in his microwave optics experiments. They were first used as a demodulator for radio communication reception in 1902 by G. W. Pickard. Crystal radios were the first widely used type of radio receiver, and the main type used during the wireless telegraphy era. Sold and homemade by the millions, the inexpensive and reliable crystal radio was a major driving force in the introduction of radio to the public, contributing to the development of radio as an entertainment medium with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920.

Around 1920, crystal sets were superseded by the first amplifying receivers, which used vacuum tubes. With this technological advance, crystal sets became obsolete for commercial use but continued to be built by hobbyists, youth groups, and the Boy Scouts mainly as a way of learning about the technology of radio. They are still sold as educational devices, and there are groups of enthusiasts devoted to their construction.

Crystal radios receive amplitude modulated (AM) signals, although FM designs have been built. They can be designed to receive almost any radio frequency band, but most receive the AM broadcast band. A few receive shortwave bands, but strong signals are required. The first crystal sets received wireless telegraphy signals broadcast by spark-gap transmitters at frequencies as low as 20 kHz.

== History ==


Crystal radio was invented by a long, partly obscure chain of discoveries in the late 19th century that gradually evolved into more and more practical radio receivers in the early 20th century. The earliest practical use of crystal radio was to receive Morse code radio signals transmitted from spark-gap transmitters by early amateur radio experimenters. As electronics evolved, the ability to send voice signals by radio caused a technological explosion around 1920 that evolved into today&#x27;s radio broadcasting industry.

=== Early years ===

Early radio telegraphy used spark gap and arc transmitters as well as high-frequency alternators running at radio frequencies. The coherer was the first means of detecting a radio signal. These, however, lacked the sensitivity to detect weak signals.

In the early 20th century, various researchers discovered that certain metallic minerals, such as galena, could be used to detect radio signals.

Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose was first to use a crystal as a radio wave detector, using galena detectors to receive microwaves starting around 1894. In 1901, Bose filed for a U.S. patent for &quot;A Device for Detecting Electrical Disturbances&quot; that mentioned the use of a galena crystal; this was granted in 1904, #755840. On August 30, 1906, Greenleaf Whittier Pickard filed a patent for a silicon crystal detector, which was granted on November 20, 1906.

A crystal detector includes a crystal, usually a thin wire or metal probe that contacts the crystal, and the stand or enclosure that holds those components in place. The most common crystal used is a small piece of galena; pyrite was also often used, as it was a more easily adjusted and stable mineral, and quite sufficient for urban signal strengths. Several other minerals also performed well as detectors. Another benefit of crystals was that they could demodulate amplitude modulated signals. This device brought radiotelephones and voice broadcast to a public audience. Crystal sets represented an inexpensive and technologically simple method of receiving these signals at a time when the embryonic radio broadcasting industry was beginning to grow.

=== 1920s and 1930s ===
In 1922 the (then named) United States Bureau of Standards released a publication entitled &quot;Construction and Operation of a Simple Homemade Radio Receiving Outfit&quot;. This article showed how almost any family having a member who was handy with simple tools could make a radio and tune into weather, crop prices, time, news and the opera. This design was significant in bringing radio to the general public. NBS followed that with a more selective two-circuit version, &quot;Construction and Operation of a Two-Circuit Radio Receiving Equipment With Crystal Detector&quot;, which was published the same year and is still frequently built by enthusiasts today.

In the beginning of the 20th century, radio had little commercial use, and radio experimentation was a hobby for many people. Some historians consider the autumn of 1920 to be the beginning of commercial radio broadcasting for entertainment purposes. Pittsburgh station KDKA, owned by Westinghouse, received its license from the United States Department of Commerce just in time to broadcast the Harding-Cox presidential election returns. In addition to reporting on special events, broadcasts to farmers of crop price reports were an important public service in the early days of radio.

In 1921, factory-made radios were very expensive. Since less-affluent families could not afford to own one, newspapers and magazines carried articles on how to build a crystal radio with common household items. To minimize the cost, many of the plans suggested winding the tuning coil on empty pasteboard containers such as oatmeal boxes, which became a common foundation for homemade radios.

=== Crystodyne ===
In early 1920s Russia, Oleg Losev was experimenting with applying voltage biases to various kinds of crystals for the manufacturing of radio detectors. The result was astonishing: with a zincite (zinc oxide) crystal he gained amplification. This was a negative resistance phenomenon, decades before the development of the tunnel diode. After the first experiments, Losev built regenerative and superheterodyne receivers, and even transmitters.

A crystodyne could be produced under primitive conditions; it could be made in a rural forge, unlike vacuum tubes and modern semiconductor devices. However, this discovery was not supported by the authorities and was soon forgotten; no device was produced in mass quantity beyond a few examples for research.

=== &quot;Foxhole radios&quot; ===
In addition to mineral crystals, the oxide coatings of many metal surfaces act as semiconductors (detectors) capable of rectification. Crystal radios have been improvised using detectors made from rusty nails, corroded pennies, and many other common objects.

When Allied troops were halted near Anzio, Italy during the spring of 1944, powered personal radio receivers were strictly prohibited as the Germans had equipment that could detect the local oscillator signal of superheterodyne receivers. Crystal sets lack power driven local oscillators, hence they could not be detected. Some resourceful soldiers constructed &quot;crystal&quot; sets from discarded materials to listen to news and music. One type used a blue steel razor blade and a pencil lead for a detector. The lead point touching the semiconducting oxide coating (magnetite) on the blade formed a crude point-contact diode. By carefully adjusting the pencil lead on the surface of the blade, they could find spots capable of rectification. The sets were dubbed &quot;foxhole radios&quot; by the popular press, and they became part of the folklore of World War II.

In some German-occupied countries during WW2 there were widespread confiscations of radio sets from the civilian population. This led determined listeners to build their own clandestine receivers which often amounted to little more than a basic crystal set. Anyone doing so risked imprisonment or even death if caught, and in most of Europe the signals from the BBC (or other allied stations) were not strong enough to be received on such a set.
=== &quot;Rocket Radio&quot; ===

In the late 1950s, the compact &quot;rocket radio&quot;, shaped like a rocket, typically imported from Japan, was introduced, and gained moderate popularity. It used a piezoelectric crystal earpiece (described later in this article), a ferrite core to reduce the size of the tuning coil (also described later), and a small germanium fixed diode, which did not require adjustment. To tune in stations, the user moved the rocket nosepiece, which, in turn, moved a ferrite core inside a coil, changing the inductance in a tuned circuit. Earlier crystal radios suffered from severely reduced Q, and resulting selectivity, from the electrical load of the earphone or earpiece. Furthermore, with its efficient earpiece, the &quot;rocket radio&quot; did not require a large antenna to gather enough signal. With much higher Q, it could typically tune in several strong local stations, while an earlier radio might only receive one station, possibly with other stations heard in the background.

For listening in areas where an electric outlet was not available, the &quot;rocket radio&quot; served as an alternative to the vacuum tube portable radios of the day, which required expensive and heavy batteries. Children could hide &quot;rocket radios&quot; under the covers, to listen to radio when their parents thought they were sleeping. Children could take the radios to public swimming pools and listen to radio when they got out of the water, clipping the ground wire to a chain link fence surrounding the pool. The rocket radio was also used as an emergency radio, because it did not require batteries or an AC outlet.

The rocket radio was available in several rocket styles, as well as other styles that featured the same basic circuit.

Transistor radios had become available at the time, but were expensive. Once those radios dropped in price, the rocket radio declined in popularity.

=== Later years ===

While it never regained the popularity and general use that it enjoyed at its beginnings, the crystal radio circuit is still used. The Boy Scouts have kept the construction of a radio set in their program since the 1920s. A large number of prefabricated novelty items and simple kits could be found through the 1950s and 1960s, and many children with an interest in electronics built one.

Building crystal radios was a craze in the 1920s, and again in the 1950s. Recently, hobbyists have started designing and building examples of the early instruments. Much effort goes into the visual appearance of these sets as well as their performance. Annual crystal radio &#x27;DX&#x27; contests (long distance reception) and building contests allow these set owners to compete with each other and form a community of interest in the subject.
==Basic principles==

A crystal radio can be thought of as a radio receiver reduced to its essentials. It consists of at least these components:

* An antenna in which electric currents are induced by electromagnetic radiation.
* A resonant circuit (tuned circuit) which selects the frequency of the desired radio station from all the radio signals received by the antenna. The tuned circuit consists of a coil of wire (called an inductor) and a capacitor connected together. The circuit has a resonant frequency, and allows radio waves at that frequency to pass through to the detector while largely blocking waves at other frequencies. One or both of the coil or capacitor is adjustable, allowing the circuit to be tuned to different frequencies. In some circuits a capacitor is not used and the antenna serves this function, as an antenna that is shorter than a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves it is meant to receive is capacitive.
* A semiconductor crystal detector that demodulates the radio signal to extract the audio signal (modulation). The crystal detector functions as a square law detector, demodulating the radio frequency alternating current to its audio frequency modulation. The detector&#x27;s audio frequency output is converted to sound by the earphone. Early sets used a &quot;cat whisker detector&quot; consisting of a small piece of crystalline mineral such as galena with a fine wire touching its surface. The crystal detector was the component that gave crystal radios their name. Modern sets use modern semiconductor diodes, although some hobbyists still experiment with crystal or other detectors.
* An earphone to convert the audio signal to sound waves so they can be heard. The low power produced by a crystal receiver is insufficient to power a loudspeaker, hence earphones are used.
As a crystal radio has no power supply, the sound power produced by the earphone comes solely from the transmitter of the radio station being received, via the radio waves captured by the antenna. The power available to a receiving antenna decreases with the square of its distance from the radio transmitter. Even for a powerful commercial broadcasting station, if it is more than a few miles from the receiver the power received by the antenna is very small, typically measured in microwatts or nanowatts. In modern crystal sets, signals as weak as 50 picowatts at the antenna can be heard. Crystal radios can receive such weak signals without using amplification only due to the great sensitivity of human hearing, which can detect sounds with an intensity of only 10−16 W/cm2. Therefore, crystal receivers have to be designed to convert the energy from the radio waves into sound waves as efficiently as possible. Even so, they are usually only able to receive stations within distances of about 25 miles for AM broadcast stations, although the radiotelegraphy signals used during the wireless telegraphy era could be received at hundreds of miles, and crystal receivers were even used for transoceanic communication during that period.

==Design==
Commercial passive receiver development was abandoned with the advent of reliable vacuum tubes around 1920, and subsequent crystal radio research was primarily done by radio amateurs and hobbyists. Many different circuits have been used. The following sections discuss the parts of a crystal radio in greater detail.

=== Antenna ===

The antenna converts the energy in the electromagnetic radio waves to an alternating electric current in the antenna, which is connected to the tuning coil. Since, in a crystal radio, all the power comes from the antenna, it is important that the antenna collect as much power from the radio wave as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long (AM broadcast band waves are long) the antenna is made as long as possible, from a long wire, in contrast to the whip antennas or ferrite loopstick antennas used in modern radios.

Serious crystal radio hobbyists use &quot;inverted L&quot; and &quot;T&quot; type antennas, consisting of hundreds of feet of wire suspended as high as possible between buildings or trees, with a feed wire attached in the center or at one end leading down to the receiver. However, more often, random lengths of wire dangling out windows are used. A popular practice in early days (particularly among apartment dwellers) was to use existing large metal objects, such as bedsprings, fire escapes, and barbed wire fences as antennas.

=== Ground ===
The wire antennas used with crystal receivers are monopole antennas which develop their output voltage with respect to ground. The receiver thus requires a connection to ground (the earth) as a return circuit for the current. The ground wire was attached to a radiator, water pipe, or a metal stake driven into the ground. In early days if an adequate ground connection could not be made a counterpoise was sometimes used. A good ground is more important for crystal sets than it is for powered receivers, as crystal sets are designed to have a low input impedance needed to transfer power efficiently from the antenna. A low resistance ground connection (preferably below 25 Ω) is necessary because any resistance in the ground reduces available power from the antenna. In contrast, modern receivers are voltage-driven devices, with high input impedance, hence little current flows in the antenna/ground circuit. Also, mains powered receivers are grounded adequately through their power cords, which are in turn attached to the earth through the building wiring.

=== Tuned circuit ===
The tuned circuit, consisting of a coil and a capacitor connected together, acts as a resonator, similar to a tuning fork. Electric charge, induced in the antenna by the radio waves, flows rapidly back and forth between the plates of the capacitor through the coil. The circuit has a high impedance at the desired radio signal&#x27;s frequency, but a low impedance at all other frequencies. Hence, signals at undesired frequencies pass through the tuned circuit to ground, while the desired frequency is instead passed on to the detector (diode) and stimulates the earpiece and is heard. The frequency of the station received is the resonant frequency &quot;f&quot; of the tuned circuit, determined by the capacitance &quot;C&quot; of the capacitor and the inductance &quot;L&quot; of the coil:

:formula_1

The circuit can be adjusted to different frequencies by varying the inductance (L), the capacitance (C), or both, &quot;tuning&quot; the circuit to the frequencies of different radio stations. In the lowest-cost sets, the inductor was made variable via a spring contact pressing against the windings that could slide along the coil, thereby introducing a larger or smaller number of turns of the coil into the circuit, varying the inductance. Alternatively, a variable capacitor is used to tune the circuit. Some modern crystal sets use a ferrite core tuning coil, in which a ferrite magnetic core is moved into and out of the coil, thereby varying the inductance by changing the magnetic permeability (this eliminated the less reliable mechanical contact).

The antenna is an integral part of the tuned circuit and its reactance contributes to determining the circuit&#x27;s resonant frequency. Antennas usually act as a capacitance, as antennas shorter than a quarter-wavelength have capacitive reactance. Many early crystal sets did not have a tuning capacitor, and relied instead on the capacitance inherent in the wire antenna (in addition to significant parasitic capacitance in the coil) to form the tuned circuit with the coil.

The earliest crystal receivers did not have a tuned circuit at all, and just consisted of a crystal detector connected between the antenna and ground, with an earphone across it. Since this circuit lacked any frequency-selective elements besides the broad resonance of the antenna, it had little ability to reject unwanted stations, so all stations within a wide band of frequencies were heard in the earphone (in practice the most powerful usually drowns out the others). It was used in the earliest days of radio, when only one or two stations were within a crystal set&#x27;s limited range.

==== Impedance matching ====
An important principle used in crystal radio design to transfer maximum power to the earphone is impedance matching. The maximum power is transferred from one part of a circuit to another when the impedance of one circuit is the complex conjugate of that of the other; this implies that the two circuits should have equal resistance. However, in crystal sets, the impedance of the antenna-ground system (around 10–200 ohms) is usually lower than the impedance of the receiver&#x27;s tuned circuit (thousands of ohms at resonance), and also varies depending on the quality of the ground attachment, length of the antenna, and the frequency to which the receiver is tuned.

Therefore, in improved receiver circuits, in order to match the antenna impedance to the receiver&#x27;s impedance, the antenna was connected across only a portion of the tuning coil&#x27;s turns. This made the tuning coil act as an impedance matching transformer (in an autotransformer connection) in addition to providing the tuning function. The antenna&#x27;s low resistance was increased (transformed) by a factor equal to the square of the turns ratio (the ratio of the number of turns the antenna was connected to, to the total number of turns of the coil), to match the resistance across the tuned circuit. In the &quot;two-slider&quot; circuit, popular during the wireless era, both the antenna and the detector circuit were attached to the coil with sliding contacts, allowing (interactive) adjustment of both the resonant frequency and the turns ratio. Alternatively a multiposition switch was used to select taps on the coil. These controls were adjusted until the station sounded loudest in the earphone.
==== Problem of selectivity ====
One of the drawbacks of crystal sets is that they are vulnerable to interference from stations near in frequency to the desired station. Often two or more stations are heard simultaneously. This is because the simple tuned circuit does not reject nearby signals well; it allows a wide band of frequencies to pass through, that is, it has a large bandwidth (low Q factor) compared to modern receivers, giving the receiver low selectivity.

The crystal detector worsened the problem, because it has relatively low resistance, thus it &quot;loaded&quot; the tuned circuit, drawing significant current and thus damping the oscillations, reducing its Q factor so it allowed through a broader band of frequencies. In many circuits, the selectivity was improved by connecting the detector and earphone circuit to a tap across only a fraction of the coil&#x27;s turns. This reduced the impedance loading of the tuned circuit, as well as improving the impedance match with the detector.
==== Inductive coupling ====
In more sophisticated crystal receivers, the tuning coil is replaced with an adjustable air core antenna coupling transformer which improves the selectivity by a technique called &quot;loose coupling&quot;. This
consists of two magnetically coupled coils of wire, one (the &quot;primary&quot;) attached to the antenna and ground and the other (the &quot;secondary&quot;) attached to the rest of the circuit. The current from the antenna creates an alternating magnetic field in the primary coil, which induced a current in the secondary coil which was then rectified and powered the earphone. Each of the coils functions as a tuned circuit; the primary coil resonated with the capacitance of the antenna (or sometimes another capacitor), and the secondary coil resonated with the tuning capacitor. Both the primary and secondary were tuned to the frequency of the station. The two circuits interacted to form a resonant transformer.

Reducing the &quot;coupling&quot; between the coils, by physically separating them so that less of the magnetic field of one intersects the other, reduces the mutual inductance, narrows the bandwidth, and results in much sharper, more selective tuning than that produced by a single tuned circuit. However, the looser coupling also reduced the power of the signal passed to the second circuit. The transformer was made with adjustable coupling, to allow the listener to experiment with various settings to gain the best reception.

One design common in early days, called a &quot;loose coupler&quot;, consisted of a smaller secondary coil inside a larger primary coil. The smaller coil was mounted on a rack so it could be slid linearly in or out of the larger coil. If radio interference was encountered, the smaller coil would be slid further out of the larger, loosening the coupling, narrowing the bandwidth, and thereby rejecting the interfering signal.

The antenna coupling transformer also functioned as an impedance matching transformer, that allowed a better match of the antenna impedance to the rest of the circuit. One or both of the coils usually had several taps which could be selected with a switch, allowing adjustment of the number of turns of that transformer and hence the &quot;turns ratio&quot;.

Coupling transformers were difficult to adjust, because the three adjustments, the tuning of the primary circuit, the tuning of the secondary circuit, and the coupling of the coils, were all interactive, and changing one affected the others.

=== Crystal detector ===


The crystal detector demodulates the radio frequency signal, extracting the modulation (the audio signal which represents the sound waves) from the radio frequency carrier wave. In early receivers, a type of crystal detector often used was a &quot;cat whisker detector&quot;. The point of contact between the wire and the crystal acted as a semiconductor diode. The cat whisker detector constituted a crude Schottky diode that allowed current to flow better in one direction than in the opposite direction. Modern crystal sets use modern semiconductor diodes. The crystal functions as an envelope detector, rectifying the alternating current radio signal to a pulsing direct current, the peaks of which trace out the audio signal, so it can be converted to sound by the earphone, which is connected to the detector.
The rectified current from the detector has radio frequency pulses from the carrier frequency in it, which are blocked by the high inductive reactance and do not pass well through the coils of early date earphones. Hence, a small capacitor called a bypass capacitor is often placed across the earphone terminals; its low reactance at radio frequency bypasses these pulses around the earphone to ground. In some sets the earphone cord had enough capacitance that this component could be omitted.

Only certain sites on the crystal surface functioned as rectifying junctions, and the device was very sensitive to the pressure of the crystal-wire contact, which could be disrupted by the slightest vibration. Therefore, a usable contact point had to be found by trial and error before each use. The operator dragged the wire across the crystal surface until a radio station or &quot;static&quot; sounds were heard in the earphones. Alternatively, some radios &quot;(circuit, right)&quot; used a battery-powered buzzer attached to the input circuit to adjust the detector. The spark at the buzzer&#x27;s electrical contacts served as a weak source of static, so when the detector began working, the buzzing could be heard in the earphones. The buzzer was then turned off, and the radio tuned to the desired station.

Galena (lead sulfide) was the most common crystal used, but various other types of crystals were also used, the most common being iron pyrite (fool&#x27;s gold, FeS2), silicon, molybdenite (MoS2), silicon carbide (carborundum, SiC), and a zincite-bornite (ZnO-Cu5FeS4) crystal-to-crystal junction trade-named &quot;Perikon&quot;. Crystal radios have also been improvised from a variety of common objects, such as blue steel razor blades and lead pencils, rusty needles, and pennies In these, a semiconducting layer of oxide or sulfide on the metal surface is usually responsible for the rectifying action.

In modern sets, a semiconductor diode is used for the detector, which is much more reliable than a crystal detector and requires no adjustments. Germanium diodes (or sometimes Schottky diodes) are used instead of silicon diodes, because their lower forward voltage drop (roughly 0.3 V compared to 0.6 V) makes them more sensitive.

All semiconductor detectors function rather inefficiently in crystal receivers, because the low voltage input to the detector is too low to result in much difference between forward better conduction direction, and the reverse weaker conduction. To improve the sensitivity of some of the early crystal detectors, such as silicon carbide, a small forward bias voltage was applied across the detector by a battery and potentiometer. The bias moves the diode&#x27;s operating point higher on the detection curve producing more signal voltage at the expense of less signal current (higher impedance). There is a limit to the benefit that this produces, depending on the other impedances of the radio. This improved sensitivity was caused by moving the DC operating point to a more desirable voltage-current operating point (impedance) on the junction&#x27;s I-V curve. The battery did not power the radio, but only provided the biasing voltage which required little power.

=== Earphones ===
The requirements for earphones used in crystal sets are different from earphones used with modern audio equipment. They have to be efficient at converting the electrical signal energy to sound waves, while most modern earphones sacrifice efficiency in order to gain high fidelity reproduction of the sound. In early homebuilt sets, the earphones were the most costly component.
The early earphones used with wireless-era crystal sets had moving iron drivers that worked in a way similar to the horn loudspeakers of the period. Each earpiece contained a permanent magnet about which was a coil of wire which formed a second electromagnet. Both magnetic poles were close to a steel diaphragm of the speaker. When the audio signal from the radio was passed through the electromagnet&#x27;s windings, current was caused to flow in the coil which created a varying magnetic field that augmented or diminished that due to the permanent magnet. This varied the force of attraction on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations of the diaphragm push and pull on the air in front of it, creating sound waves. Standard headphones used in telephone work had a low impedance, often 75 Ω, and required more current than a crystal radio could supply. Therefore, the type used with crystal set radios (and other sensitive equipment) was wound with more turns of finer wire giving it a high impedance of 2000–8000 Ω.

Modern crystal sets use piezoelectric crystal earpieces, which are much more sensitive and also smaller. They consist of a piezoelectric crystal with electrodes attached to each side, glued to a light diaphragm. When the audio signal from the radio set is applied to the electrodes, it causes the crystal to vibrate, vibrating the diaphragm. Crystal earphones are designed as ear buds that plug directly into the ear canal of the wearer, coupling the sound more efficiently to the eardrum. Their resistance is much higher (typically megohms) so they do not greatly &quot;load&quot; the tuned circuit, allowing increased selectivity of the receiver. The piezoelectric earphone&#x27;s higher resistance, in parallel with its capacitance of around 9 pF, creates a filter that allows the passage of low frequencies, but blocks the higher frequencies. In that case a bypass capacitor is not needed (although in practice a small one of around 0.68 to 1 nF is often used to help improve quality), but instead a 10–100 kΩ resistor must be added in parallel with the earphone&#x27;s input.

Although the low power produced by crystal radios is typically insufficient to drive a loudspeaker, some homemade 1960s sets have used one, with an audio transformer to match the low impedance of the speaker to the circuit. Similarly, modern low-impedance (8 Ω) earphones cannot be used unmodified in crystal sets because the receiver does not produce enough current to drive them. They are sometimes used by adding an audio transformer to match their impedance with the higher impedance of the driving antenna circuit.

== Use as a power source ==

A crystal radio tuned to a strong local transmitter can be used as a power source for a second amplified receiver of a distant station that cannot be heard without amplification.

There is a long history of unsuccessful attempts and unverified claims to recover the power in the carrier of the received signal itself. Conventional crystal sets use half-wave rectifiers. As AM signals have a modulation factor of only 30% by voltage at peaks, no more than 9% of received signal power (formula_2) is actual audio information, and 91% is just rectified DC voltage. &lt;correction&gt; The 30% figure is the standard used for radio testing, and is based on the average modulation factor for speech. Properly-designed and managed AM transmitters can be run to 100% modulation on peaks without causing distortion or &quot;splatter&quot; (excess sideband energy that radiates outside of the intended signal bandwidth). Given that the audio signal is unlikely to be at peak all the time, the ratio of energy is, in practice, even greater. Considerable effort was made to convert this DC voltage into sound energy. Some earlier attempts include a one-transistor amplifier in 1966. Sometimes efforts to recover this power are confused with other efforts to produce a more efficient detection. This history continues now with designs as elaborate as &quot;inverted two-wave switching power unit&quot;.

During the wireless telegraphy era before 1920, crystal receivers were &quot;state of the art&quot;, and sophisticated models were produced. After 1920 crystal sets became the cheap alternative to vacuum tube radios, used in emergencies and by youth and the poor.

<text>The tundra swan (Cygnus columbianus) is a small swan of the Holarctic. The two taxa within it are usually regarded as conspecific, but are also sometimes split into two species: Bewick&#x27;s swan (&quot;Cygnus bewickii&quot;) of the Palaearctic and the whistling swan (&quot;C. columbianus&quot;) proper of the Nearctic. Birds from eastern Russia (roughly east of the Taymyr Peninsula) are sometimes separated as the subspecies &quot;C. c. jankowskii&quot;, but this is not widely accepted as distinct, with most authors including them in &quot;C. c. bewickii&quot;. Tundra swans are sometimes separated in the subgenus &quot;Olor&quot; together with the other Arctic swan species.

Bewick&#x27;s swan was named in 1830 by William Yarrell after the engraver Thomas Bewick, who specialised in illustrations of birds and animals. &quot;Cygnus&quot; is the Latin for &quot;swan&quot;, and &quot; columbianus&quot; comes from the Columbia River, the type locality.

==Description==

&quot;C. columbianus&quot; is the smallest of the Holarctic swans, at in length, in wingspan and a weight range of . In adult birds, the plumage of both subspecies is entirely white, with black feet, and a bill that is mostly black, with a thin salmon-pink streak running along the mouthline and – depending on the subspecies – more or less yellow in the proximal part. The iris is dark brown. In birds living in waters that contains large amounts of iron ions (e.g. bog lakes), the head and neck plumage acquires a golden or rusty hue. Pens (females) are slightly smaller than cobs (males), but do not differ in appearance otherwise.

Immatures of both subspecies are white mixed with some dull grey feathering, mainly on the head and upper neck, which are often entirely light grey; their first-summer plumage is quite white already, and in their second winter they moult into the adult plumage. Their bills are black with a large dirty-pink patch taking up most of the proximal half and often black nostrils, and their feet are dark grey with a pinkish hue. Downy young are silvery grey above and white below.

Bewick&#x27;s swans are the smaller subspecies. There is a slight size cline, with the eastern birds being slightly larger; good measurement data only exists for the western populations however. These weigh , on average in males and in females. They measure in overall length; each wing is long, on average in males and in females. The tarsus measures in length, the bill , averaging . Bewick&#x27;s swan is similar in appearance to the parapatric whooper swan (&quot;C. cygnus&quot;), but is smaller, shorter-necked and has a more rounded head shape, with variable bill pattern, but always showing more black than yellow and having a blunt forward edge of the yellow base patch. Whooper swans have a bill that has more yellow than black and the forward edge of the yellow patch is usually pointed. The bill pattern for every individual Bewick&#x27;s swan is unique, and scientists often make detailed drawings of each bill and assign names to the swans to assist with studying these birds. The eastern birds, apart from being larger, tend towards less yellow on the bill, perhaps indicating that gene flow across Beringia, while marginal, never entirely ceased. An apparent case of hybridization between a Bewick&#x27;s and a vagrant whistling swan has been reported from eastern Siberia.

Whistling swans weigh – on average in males and in females –, and measure in length. Each wing is long; the tarsus measures in length, and the bill is long. &quot;C. c. columbianus&quot; is distinguished from &quot;C. c. bewickii&quot; by its larger size and the mostly black bill, with just a small and usually hard to see yellow spot of variable size at the base. It is distinguished from the largely allopatric trumpeter swan (&quot;C. buccinator&quot;) of North America by that species&#x27; much larger size and particularly long bill, which is black all over except for the pink mouthline, which is stronger than in the whistling swan.

Note that color variations with more or less yellow, or pink instead of yellow or black, are not exceptional, especially in Bewick&#x27;s swans, which very rarely may even have yellowish feet. The small size and particularly the rather short neck, which make it look like a large white goose, are still distinguishing marks.

Tundra swans have high-pitched honking calls and sound similar to a black goose (&quot;Branta&quot;). They are particularly vocal when foraging in flocks on their wintering grounds; any conspecific arriving or leaving will elicit a bout of loud excited calling from its fellows. Contrary to its common name, the ground calls of the whistling swan are not a whistle and neither notably different from that of Bewick&#x27;s swan. The flight call of the latter is a low and soft ringing bark, &quot;bow-wow...&quot;; the whistling swan gives a markedly high-pitched trisyllabic bark like &quot;wow-wow-wow&quot; in flight. By contrast, the whooper and trumpeter swans&#x27; names accurately describe their calls—a deep hooting and a higher-pitched French horn-like honk, respectively. Flying birds of these species are shorter-necked and have a quicker wingbeat than their relatives, but they are often impossible to tell apart except by their calls.

==Distribution==


As their common name implies, the tundra swan breeds in the tundra of the Arctic and subarctic, where they inhabit shallow pools, lakes and rivers. These birds, unlike mute swans (&quot;C. olor&quot;) but like the other Arctic swans, are migratory birds. The winter habitat of both subspecies is grassland and marshland, often near the coast; they like to visit fields after harvest to feed on discarded grains and while on migration may stop over on mountain lakes. According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, when migrating these birds can fly at altitudes of in a V formation.

The breeding range of &quot;C. c. bewickii&quot; extends across the coastal lowlands of Siberia, from the Kola Peninsula east to the Pacific. They start to arrive on the breeding grounds around mid-May, and leave for winter quarters around the end of September. The populations west of the Taymyr Peninsula migrate via the White Sea, Baltic Sea and the estuary of the Elbe to winter in Denmark, the Netherlands and the British Isles. They are common in winter in the wildfowl nature reserves of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and of the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust. Some birds also winter elsewhere on the southern shores of the North Sea. Bewick&#x27;s swans breeding in eastern Russia migrate via Mongolia and northern China to winter in the coastal regions of Korea, Japan, and southern China, south to Guangdong and occasionally as far as Taiwan. A few birds from the central Siberian range also winter in Iran at the south of the Caspian Sea; in former times these flocks also migrated to the Aral Sea before the late 20th century ecological catastrophe turned most of the habitat there into inhospitable wasteland. Arrival in winter quarters starts about mid-October, though most spend weeks or even months at favorite resting locations and will only arrive in winter quarters by November or even as late as January. The birds leave winter quarters to breed starting in mid-February. Vagrants may occur south of the main wintering range in cold years and have been recorded from most European countries where the birds do not regularly winter, as well as Algeria, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Nepal, northeast Pakistan, and on the Mariana and Volcano Islands in the western Pacific. Vagrants on the spring migration have been sighted on Bear Island, Iceland and Svalbard, and in Alaska, Oregon and Saskatchewan in North America.

&quot;C. c. columbianus&quot; breeds in the coastal plains of Alaska and Canada, leaving for winter quarters about October. They arrive in winter quarters by November/December. Birds breeding in western Alaska winter along the Pacific coast from southern Alaska to California; they often move inland – particularly to the rich feeding grounds in the Central Valley – and some cross the Rocky Mountains again and winter as far east as Utah and south to Texas and northern Mexico. The birds breeding along the Arctic Ocean coast migrate via Canada and the Great Lakes region to winter at the Atlantic coast of the United States, mainly from Maryland to North Carolina, but some move as far south as Florida. Whistling swans start leaving for the breeding grounds again by mid-March, and arrive by late May. Vagrants have been recorded on the Bermudas, Cuba the Hawaiian Islands, Puerto Rico, and in England, Ireland, Japan, northeastern Siberia and Sweden.

==Ecology and biology==
===Diet===
In summer, their diet consists mainly of aquatic vegetation, e.g. mannagrass (&quot;Glyceria&quot;), &quot;Potamogeton&quot; pondweeds and marine eelgrass (&quot;Zostera&quot;), acquired by sticking the head underwater or upending while swimming; they also eat some grass growing on dry land. At other times of year, leftover grains and other crops such as potatoes, picked up in open fields after harvest, make up much of their diet. Tundra swans forage mainly by day. In the breeding season, they tend to be territorial and are aggressive to many animals who pass by; outside the breeding season they are rather gregarious birds.

===Natural predator===
Healthy adult birds have few natural predators. The Arctic fox (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;), parasitic jaegers (&quot;Stercorarius parasiticus&quot;), and glaucous gull (&quot;Larus hyperboreus&quot;) can take the eggs and hatchlings. Adults typically can stand their ground and displace foxes and birds but occasionally they are successful when both adults are absent due to disturbance or territorial dispute. Another surprisingly serious nest predator for tundra swans are brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), which were apparently the primary cause of nesting failure in both the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. Other potential nest predators include red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;). Brown bear, golden eagles and rarely, gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) may on occasion succeed at capturing and killing an adult. Small or avian predators usually elicit either an aggressive response or the behavior of sitting tight on nests while larger mammals, perhaps more dangerous to adults, usually elicit the response of leading the cygnets into deep waters and standing still until they pass. About 15% of the adults die each year from various causes, and thus the average lifespan in the wild is about 10 years. The oldest recorded tundra swan was over 24 years old.

===Reproduction===

The tundra swans mate in the late spring, usually after they have returned to the nesting grounds; as usual for swans, they pair monogamously until one partner dies. Should one partner die long before the other, the surviving bird often will not mate again for some years, or even for its entire life. The nesting season starts at the end of May. The pair build the large mound-shaped nest from plant material at an elevated site near open water, and defend a large territory around it. The pen (female) lays and incubates a clutch of 2–7 (usually 3–5) eggs, watching for danger while sitting on the nest. The cob (male) keeps a steady lookout for potential predators heading towards his mate and offspring. When either of them spots a threat, they give a warning sound to let their partner know that danger is approaching. Sometimes the cob will use his wings to run faster and appear larger in order to scare away a predator.

The time from laying to hatching is 29–30 days for Bewick&#x27;s swan and 30–32 days for the whistling swan. Since they nest in cold regions, tundra swan cygnets grow faster than those of swans breeding in warmer climates; those of the whistling swan take about 60–75 days to fledge—twice as fast as those of the mute swan for example—while those of Bewick&#x27;s swan, about which little breeding data is known, may fledge a record 40–45 days after hatching already. The fledglings stay with their parents for the first winter migration. The family is sometimes even joined by their offspring from previous breeding seasons while on the wintering grounds; Tundra swans do not reach sexual maturity until 3 or 4 years of age.

==Conservation status==

The whistling swan is the most common swan species of North America, estimated to number almost 170,000 individuals around 1990. Its numbers seem to be slowly declining in the west of its range since the late 19th century, coincident with the expansion of human settlement and habitat conversion in the birds&#x27; wintering areas; the eastern whistling swan populations on the other hand seem to be increasing somewhat, and altogether its numbers seem to have slightly risen in the late 20th century (the population was estimated at 146,000 in 1972). Bewick&#x27;s swan remains far less known; although its population is in decline in northwestern Europe, for currently unexplained reasons. The European winter population was estimated at 16,000–17,000 about 1990, with about 20,000 birds wintering in east Asia. The Iranian wintering population is small—1,000 birds or so at most—but they usually disperse to several sites, some of which are still unknown to scientists.

Although tundra swan numbers are stable over most of its range, they are increasingly dependent on agricultural crops to supplement their winter diet, as aquatic vegetation in their winter habitat dwindles due to habitat destruction and water pollution. But the main cause of adult mortality is hunting; 4,000 whistling swans are bagged officially each year, while a further 6,000–10,000 are killed by poachers and native subsistence hunter-gatherers. Bewick&#x27;s swan cannot be hunted legally, but almost half the birds studied contained lead shot in their body, indicating they were shot at by poachers. Lead poisoning by ingestion of lead shot is a very significant cause of mortality also, particularly in the whistling swan. The tundra swan is not considered threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its large range and population. The proposed subspecies &quot;jankowskii&quot; was for some time placed on CITES Appendix II; it was eventually removed since it is not generally accepted as valid.

Bewick&#x27;s swan is one of the birds to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

Toxic mining wastes in the Silver Valley, Idaho in the United States has been known to be responsible for the death of migrating tundra swans.

<text>Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey (13 March 1764 – 17 July 1845), known as Viscount Howick between 1806 and 1807, was a British Whig politician, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1834. Prime Minister Grey notably enacted the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, which abolished slavery in the British Empire via compensated emancipation, ordering the British government to purchase the freedom of all slaves in the British Empire.

Grey was a long-time leader of the reform movement. He presented his first petition to extend the electoral franchise of voting as a member of parliament in 1792, and as prime minister, he ultimately legislated the Reform Act of 1832, which extended the franchise of voting in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and which was accompanied by extensions of the electoral franchise in Scotland and Ireland with the Scottish Reform Act 1832 and the Irish Reform Act 1832. He resigned as prime minister in 1834 over disagreements in his cabinet regarding Ireland, and he retired from politics. Scholars rank him highly among British prime ministers, believing that he defused civil strife and enabled Victorian progress. He is the namesake of Earl Grey tea. 

==Early life==
Grey was born at Howick Hall, Northumberland on 13 March, 1674, the second son of Lieutenant-General Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey and his wife Countess Elizabeth Grey. He had four brothers and two sisters. He was educated at Richmond School, Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge.

== Early political career==
=== Member of Parliament ===
Grey was elected to Parliament for the Northumberland constituency on 14 September 1786, aged 22 years old. He became a part of the Whig circle of Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and the Prince of Wales, and soon became one of the major leaders of the Whig party. He was the youngest manager on the committee for prosecuting Warren Hastings.

Grey was also notable for advocating parliamentary reform and electoral reform. During the French Revolution and the revolutionary ideals of liberty, freedom and equality became widespread across Europe and beyond. In Britain, the demand for universal suffrage inspired the Tory Prime Minister Pitt to enact legislation against sedition and revolutionary activities deemed as being against British values of democracy. Pitt&#x27;s later tenure was dubbed by his enemies as &quot;Pitt&#x27;s Terror&quot;. Charles Fox and Richard Sheridan Brinsley, allies and mentors of the young Grey, denounced the government&#x27;s actions for suppressing reform movements due to association with revolutionary ideals.

In 1792, Grey was the driving force of a petition presented to Parliament in favor of reforms aimed at restoring &quot;the freedom of election and a more equal representation of the people in parliament, and securing to the people a more frequent exercise of their right of electing their representatives,&quot; as a 1884 book described it. In his drive for egalitarian representation, he sought to extend the democratic franchise, and he favored Catholic emancipation. Although the 1792 petition produced no change, his reform was finally achieved 40 years later with his enactment of the Reform Act of 1832.

==Foreign secretary, 1806–1807==
In 1806, Grey became First Lord of the Admiralty, and he was a part of the Ministry of All the Talents (a coalition of Foxite Whigs, Grenvillites, and Addingtonites).

Following Fox&#x27;s death later that year, Howick took over both as foreign secretary and as leader of the Whigs. The ministry broke up in 1807 when George III blocked Catholic Emancipation legislation and required that all ministers individually sign a pledge, which Howick refused to do, that they would not &quot;propose any further concessions to the Catholics&quot;.

==Years in opposition, 1807–1830==

The government fell from power the next year, and, after a brief period as a member of parliament for Appleby from May to July 1807, Howick went to the Lords, succeeding his father as Earl Grey. He continued in opposition for the next 23 years. In 1811, the Prince Regent tried to court Grey and his ally William Grenville to join the Spencer Perceval ministry following the resignation of Lord Wellesley. Grey and Grenville declined because the Prince Regent refused to make concessions regarding Catholic emancipation.

On the Napoleonic Wars, Grey took the standard Whig party line. After being initially enthused by the Spanish uprising against Napoleon, Grey became convinced of the French emperor&#x27;s invincibility following the defeat and death of Sir John Moore, the leader of the British forces in the Peninsular War. Grey was then slow to recognise the military successes of Moore&#x27;s successor, the Duke of Wellington. When Napoleon first abdicated in 1814, Grey objected to the restoration of the Bourbons&#x27; authoritarian monarchy; and when Napoleon was reinstalled the following year, he said that the change was an internal French matter.

In 1826, believing that the Whig party no longer paid any attention to his opinions, Grey stood down as leader in favour of Lord Lansdowne. The following year, when George Canning succeeded Lord Liverpool as prime minister, it was, therefore, Lansdowne and not Grey who was asked to join the Government, which needed strengthening following the resignations of Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington. When Wellington became prime minister in 1828, George IV (as the Prince Regent had become) singled out Grey as the one person he could not appoint to the Government.

==Prime Minister (1830–1834)==
In 1830, following the death of George IV and the resignation of the Duke of Wellington on the question of Parliamentary reform, the Whigs finally returned to power, with Grey as prime minister. In 1831, he was made a member of the Order of the Garter.

In 1832, Grey enacted the Great Reform Act of 1832, which expanded the electorate in the United Kingdom. The legislation granted the right to vote to a broader segment of the male population by standardizing property qualifications, extending the franchise to small landowners, tenant farmers, shopkeepers. all householders who paid a yearly rental of £10 or more. 

In 1833, Grey enacted the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, which abolished slavery in the British Empire. The legislation ordered the British government to purchase the freedom of all slaves in the British Empire, in the way of compensated emancipation, and by outlawing the further practice of slavery in the British Empire. 

Grey also contributed to a plan to found a new colony in South Australia: in 1831 a &quot;Proposal to His Majesty&#x27;s Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia&quot; was prepared under the auspices of Robert Gouger, Anthony Bacon, Jeremy Bentham and Grey, but its ideas were considered too radical, and it was unable to attract the required investment. In the same year, Grey was appointed to serve on the Government Commission upon Emigration (which was wound up in 1832).

In 1831 two acts were introduced concerning Truck wages. The first repealed all existing enactments on the subject, &quot;and the second provided that workmen in a number of the principal industries must receive payment in the current coin of the realm.&quot;

In 1834, the cabinet was divided over Catholic emancipation. Lord Anglesey, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, preferred conciliatory reform, including the partial redistribution of the income from the tithes to the Roman Catholic Church, and away from the established Church of Ireland, a policy known as &quot;appropriation&quot;. The Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Stanley, however, preferred coercive measures. At this gridlock, Grey resigned as prime miniser in 1834, and he nominated Lord Melbourne as his successor.

==Personal life==
Before his marriage, Grey had an affair with the married Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. Grey met Cavendish while attending a Whig society meeting in Devonshire House. In 1791, the Duchess of Devonshire became pregnant with Grey&#x27;s child, and she was sent to France, where she gave birth to their illegitimate daughter, who was raised by Grey&#x27;s parents. Their daughter was named Eliza Courtney (20 February 1792 – 2 May 1859). She married Robert Ellice.

===Marriage and children===
On 18 November 1794, Grey married Mary Elizabeth Ponsonby (1776–1861), only daughter of William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Imokilly and Louisa Molesworth. They had ten sons and five daughters, as follows:

*Louisa Elizabeth Grey (7 April 1797 – 26 November 1841). She married John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, on 9 December 1816. They had five children, including Charles William, Grey&#x27;s favourite grandson, who died young.
*Elizabeth Grey (10 July 1798 – 8 November 1880). She married John Crocker Bulteel on 13 May 1826. They had five children.
*Caroline Grey (30 August 1799 – 28 April 1875). She married Captain George Barrington on 15 January 1827. They had two children

*William Grey (13 May 1808 – 11 February 1815), who died at the age of six.
*Admiral George Grey (16 May 1809 – 3 October 1891). He married Jane Stuart (daughter of General Sir Patrick Stuart) on 20 January 1845. They had eleven children.
*Thomas Grey (29 December 1810 – 8 July 1826), who died at the age of fifteen. 
*Rev. John Grey MA, DD (2 March 1812 – 11 November 1895), Canon of Durham, Rector of Houghton-le-Spring. He married Lady Georgiana Hervey (daughter of Frederick William Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol) in July 1836. They had three children. He remarried Helen Spalding (maternal granddaughter of John Henry Upton, 1st Viscount Templetown) on 11 April 1874.
*Rev. Francis Richard Grey MA (31 March 1813 – 22 March 1890), Canon of Durham, Canon of Newcastle, Rector of Morpeth. He married Lady Elizabeth Dorothy Anne Howard, daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle on 12 August 1840.
*Captain Henry Cavendish Grey (16 October 1814 – 5 September 1880)
*William George Grey (15 February 1819 – 19 December 1865). He married Theresa Stedink on 20 September 1858.
===Later years and death===
Grey spent his last years in contented, if sometimes fretful, retirement at Howick with his books, his family, and his dogs. The one great personal blow he suffered in old age was the death of his favourite grandson, Charles, at the age of 13. Grey became physically feeble in his last years and died quietly in his bed on 17 July 1845, forty-four years to the day since going to live at Howick. He was buried in the Church of St Michael and All Angels there on the 26th in the presence of his family, close friends, and the labourers on his estate.

His biographer G. M. Trevelyan argues: &quot;In our domestic history 1832 is the next great landmark after 1688 ... [It] saved the land from revolution and civil strife and made possible the quiet progress of the Victorian era.

==Legacy==
Grey is commemorated by Grey&#x27;s Monument in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne, which consists of a statue of Lord Grey standing atop a high column. The monument was damaged by lightning in 1941 and the statue&#x27;s head was knocked off. The monument lends its name to Monument Metro station on the Tyne and Wear Metro, located directly underneath. Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne, which runs south-east from the monument, is also named after Grey.

Durham University&#x27;s Grey College is named after Grey, who as prime minister in 1832 supported the Act of Parliament that established the university.

Earl Grey tea, a blend which uses bergamot oil to flavour the brew, is named after Grey.

<text>The Vauxhall Magnum is a car which was manufactured by Vauxhall from 1973 to 1978. First seen at the London Motor Show in October 1973, the Magnum was an HC Viva with a larger engine, more luxurious interior, higher trim level and four rather than two headlights. It shared its suspension and drive train with the larger-engined variants of the Vauxhall Viva and Firenza.

The smaller-engined version used the 1800 cc Slant-Four engine, and a twin-dial instrument panel, while the more powerful version used the 2279 cc Slant-Four and had a seven-dial instrument panel. Both were available in 2- and 4-door versions, a 3-door fastback estate and a coupé. All had &quot;Rostyle&quot; wheels. Confusingly, it was also possible to buy certain Viva models with the larger engines, but with vinyl interior trim. The continuing lack of coherency of the model range during that period was one of Vauxhall&#x27;s main marketing problems. Late in the model&#x27;s life there was a mild &quot;upgrade&quot; which saw the 2300 switch from twin to single carb with a drop of 2 hp to 108 hp, although the 1800 jumped from 77 hp to 88 hp which cut the 0–60 mph time by 3s to 12.5s, and raised the top speed to 100 mph from 93 mph previously.

The Magnum badge also superseded the Firenza badge used on the two-door coupé model, which name was then used exclusively for the HPF &quot;droopsnoot&quot; model from 1974 (see Firenza). The Magnum model range continued until 1978: by then it was increasingly being overshadowed in the domestic market place by the Ascona-based Vauxhall Cavalier.

The various trim and body options that were originally exclusive to the Magnum made their way over to the Viva, producing the top-of-the-line Viva GLS, in a bid to shore up the increasingly poor sales of the model. The main difference aside from badging was that the Viva GLS only had the 1256 cc and 1759 cc engines, the latter only with an automatic box. The Viva range was finally discontinued in 1979. The Magnum name was adopted for the Viva 1300 in New Zealand from 1975, where it had the four headlight frontal treatment of the British Magnum, but standard Viva interior trim.

A special variant of the Magnum estate, known as the Sportshatch, was produced in limited numbers (197) in 1976. This model used the &quot;droopsnoot&quot; nose cone, which had been designed by Wayne Cherry, Vauxhall&#x27;s Chief Design Engineer to be used in the HP Firenza Droop Snoot model. In Trevor Alder&#x27;s book &quot;Vauxhall — The Post War Years&quot; mention is made of a HP Firenza Sport Hatch prototype which was a one-off and was painted in silver starfire, with a six-light version of the droop snoot nose and also sharing the Viva/Magnum estate body shell. This car (registration plate GNK 31N) has survived and is known to be in the hands of Vauxhall enthusiasts.

The HP Firenza project was proposed to produce over 2,000 cars a year, but production of this model ceased after just 204 examples were built. Some nose cones were left over at end of production and these were used in the limited run of &quot;Sports Hatch&quot; models as described above.

The Sports Hatch limited edition did not share the uprated 2279 cc slant four engine with the HP Firenza Droop Snoot model, but instead was fitted with the standard tune single carb 2279 cc slant four engine and running gear of the Magnum. Also included in the standard specification was the famous &quot;seven dial dash&quot;, Avon Safety Wheels and a distinctive paint finish in a then brand new Vauxhall &quot;Extra Dark Wine&quot; (only available otherwise on the brand new for 1976 VX 2300 GLS model) which was complemented with bright red striping and highlights. This model was always rare with 197 vehicles being completed and is now highly collectable. Vauxhall marketed this car as a &quot;hatchback&quot;, since it was coming under increasing pressure from new European models such as the Golf that were hatchbacks. However, the Sportshatch shared its bodyshell with the Viva Estate (which was only ever produced in a two-door plus tailgate configuration).

The Magnum coupé is also worthy of mention in the Magnum range. There were only 1692 coupés produced from late 1973 to early 1975 with the majority sold later in the model&#x27;s life due to the 1973 oil crisis. The Magnum range had larger engines than most other Vauxhalls thus were one of the cars with the most affected sales in this period. The 2279 cc engined car had a particularly short run of only 525, according to Vauxhall 427 cars were produced in 1974 and 98 in 1975, only 1167 1759 cc engined coupés were produced.

Performance was quite brisk, but fuel economy was never the Magnum&#x27;s (or the Vauxhall Slant Four Engine&#x27;s generally) strong point. In normal use the Magnum 2300 would manage around 25mpg, rising to over 30mpg on a restrained motorway journey.

<text>The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was a country in Southeast and Central Europe that existed from 1918 until 1941. From 1918 to 1929, it was officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, but the term &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; () has been its colloquial name as early as 1922 due to its origins. The official name of the state was changed to &quot;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&quot; by King Alexander I on 3 October 1929.

The preliminary kingdom was formed in 1918 by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (itself formed from territories of the former Austria-Hungary, encompassing what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina and most of what are now the states of Croatia and Slovenia) and Banat, Bačka and Baranja (that had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary within Austria-Hungary) with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia. In the same year, the Kingdom of Montenegro also proclaimed its unification with Serbia, whereas the regions of Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia had become parts of Serbia prior to the unification.

The state was ruled by the Serbian dynasty of Karađorđević, which previously ruled the Kingdom of Serbia under Peter I from 1903 (after the May Coup) onward. Peter I became the first king of Yugoslavia until his death in 1921. He was succeeded by his son Alexander I, who had been regent for his father. He was known as &quot;Alexander the Unifier&quot; and he renamed the kingdom &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; in 1929. He was assassinated in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), during his visit to France in 1934. The crown passed to his 11-year-old son, Peter. Alexander&#x27;s cousin Paul ruled as Prince regent until 1941, when Peter II came of age. The royal family flew to London the same year, prior to the country being invaded by the Axis powers.

In April 1941, the country was occupied and partitioned by the Axis powers. A royal government-in-exile, recognized by the United Kingdom and, later, by all the Allies, was established in London. In 1944, after pressure from the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the King recognized the government of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia as the legitimate government. This was established on 2 November following the signing of the Treaty of Vis by Ivan Šubašić (on behalf of the Kingdom) and Josip Broz Tito (on behalf of the Yugoslav Partisans).

==Formation==


Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by the Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip and the outbreak of World War I, Serbia was invaded and occupied by a combined Bulgarian, Austrian and German force on 6 October 1915. This saw the escalation of South Slavic nationalism and calls by Slavic nationalists for the independence and unification of the South Slavic nationalities of Austria-Hungary along with Serbia and Montenegro into a single State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.

The Dalmatian Croat politician Ante Trumbić became a prominent South Slavic leader during the war and led the Yugoslav Committee that lobbied the Allies to support the creation of an independent Yugoslavia. Trumbić faced initial hostility from Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić, who preferred an enlarged Serbia over a unified Yugoslav state. However, both Pašić and Trumbić agreed to a compromise, which was delivered at the Corfu Declaration on 20 July 1917 that advocated the creation of a united state of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes to be led by the Serbian House of Karađorđević.

In 1916, the Yugoslav Committee started negotiations with the Serbian Government in exile, on which they decided on the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, declaring the joint Corfu Declaration in 1917, the meetings were held at the Municipal Theatre of Corfu.

In November 1918, the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs appointed 28 members to start negotiation with the representatives of the government of the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro on creation of a new Yugoslav state, the delegation negotiated directly with regent Alexander Karađorđević. The negotiations would end, with the delegation of the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs led by Ante Pavelić reading the address in front of regent Alexander, who represented his father, King Peter I of Serbia, by which acceptance the kingdom was established.

The name of the new Yugoslav state was Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (; ) or its abbreviated form Kingdom of SCS ( / ).

The new kingdom was made up of the formerly independent kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro (Montenegro having been absorbed into Serbia the previous month), and of a substantial amount of territory that was formerly part of Austria-Hungary, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The main states which formed the new Kingdom were the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs; Vojvodina; and the Kingdom of Serbia with the Kingdom of Montenegro.

The creation of the state was supported by pan-Slavists and Yugoslav nationalists. For the pan-Slavic movement, all of the South Slav (Yugoslav) people had united into a single state. The creation was also supported by the Allies, who sought to break up the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

The newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes participated in the Paris Peace Conference with Trumbić as the country&#x27;s representative. Since the Allies had lured the Italians into the war with a promise of substantial territorial gains in exchange, which cut off a quarter of Slovene ethnic territory from the remaining three-quarters of Slovenes living in the Kingdom of SCS, Trumbić successfully vouched for the inclusion of most Slavs living in the former Austria-Hungary to be included within the borders of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Nevertheless, with the Treaty of Rapallo a population of half a million South Slavs, mostly Slovenes, were subjected to forced Italianization until the fall of Fascism in Italy. At the time when Benito Mussolini was willing to modify the Rapallo borders in order to annex the independent state of Rijeka to Italy, Pašić&#x27;s attempts to correct the borders at Postojna and Idrija were effectively undermined by the regent Alexander who preferred &quot;good relations&quot; with Italy.

The Yugoslav kingdom bordered Italy and Austria to the northwest at the Rapallo border, Hungary and Romania to the north, Bulgaria to the east, Greece and Albania to the south, and the Adriatic Sea to the west. Almost immediately, it ran into disputes with most of its neighbours. Slovenia was difficult to determine, since it had been an integral part of Austria for 400 years. The Vojvodina region was disputed with Hungary, Macedonia with Bulgaria, Rijeka with Italy.

A plebiscite was also held in the Province of Carinthia, which opted to remain in Austria. Austrians had formed a majority in this region although numbers reflected that some Slovenes did vote for Carinthia to become part of Austria. The Dalmatian port city of Zadar and a few of the Dalmatian islands were given to Italy. The city of Rijeka was declared to be the Free State of Fiume, but it was soon occupied, and in 1924 annexed, by Italy, which had also been promised the Dalmatian coast during World War I, and Yugoslavia claiming Istria, a part of the former Austrian Littoral which had been annexed to Italy, but which contained a considerable population of Croats and Slovenes.

The formation of the Vidovdan Constitution in 1921 sparked tensions between the different Yugoslav ethnic groups. Trumbić opposed the 1921 constitution and over time grew increasingly hostile towards the Yugoslav government that he saw as being centralized in the favor of Serb hegemony over Yugoslavia.

==Economy==

=== Farming ===
Three-quarters of the Yugoslav workforce was engaged in agriculture. A few commercial farmers existed, but most were subsistence peasants. Those in the south were especially poor, living in a hilly, infertile region. No large estates existed except in the north, and all of those were owned by foreigners. Indeed, one of the first actions undertaken by the new Yugoslav state in 1919 was to break up the estates and dispose of foreign, and in particular Hungarian landowners. Nearly 40% of the rural population was surplus (i.e., excess people not needed to maintain current production levels), and despite a warm climate, Yugoslavia was also relatively dry. Internal communications were poor, damage from World War I had been extensive, and with few exceptions agriculture was devoid of machinery or other modern farming technologies.

The 1931 census revealed that 34% of Yugoslav peasants owned less than five acres of land; another 34% owned between five-twelve acres of land; 29% owned fifty acres; and 3% owned more than fifty acres. The interwar era saw the emergence of a class known as the worker-peasants who engaged in seasonal work, working part of the year on the farm and another part in industry, usually mining. About 90% of Yugoslav farmers owned their own land, which explained why so many were unwilling to break with their rural lifestyle completely. More than half of industrial workers belonged to the worker-peasant category. In 1931, the Social Ministry reported: that in Yugoslavia there is a constant stream of laborers coming and going from agriculture to industry and vice versa. What has developed is a new class of workers-we call them industrialized peasants-who are regularly employed industry without having broken their ties to agriculture&quot;. The Great Depression hurt Yugoslavia very badly with most people living a lower standard of living in 1940 than they had in 1920. Between 1925-1933, the income of peasants fell by two-thirds.

=== Manufacturing ===
Manufacturing was limited to Belgrade and the other major population centers, and consisted mainly of small, comparatively primitive facilities that produced strictly for the domestic market. The commercial potential of Yugoslavia&#x27;s Adriatic ports went to waste because the nation lacked the capital or technical knowledge to operate a shipping industry. On the other hand, the mining industry was well developed due to the nation&#x27;s abundance of mineral resources, but since it was primarily owned and operated by foreigners, most production was exported. Yugoslavia was the third least industrialized nation in Eastern Europe after Bulgaria and Albania.

Yugoslavia was rich in deposits of coal, iron, copper, gold, silver, lead, zinc, chrome, manganese and bauxite, and mining was one of the most important industries in the kingdom. The backwardness of Yugoslavia prevented the mining industry from becoming the basis of an industrial society. The lack of electricity was a major problem. In 1934, the electricity consumption in Belgrade was 90 kilowatts per hour compared to 253 kilowatts per hour in Budapest and 367 kilowatts per hour in Paris. The lack of a manufacturing basis led to the situation where raw materials were exported from Yugoslavia to more developed nations, usually Britain, France or Germany, and Yugoslavs had to buy the products from those nations made with their raw materials. Despite these limitations, industry did begin to grow in Yugoslavia with 2,193 factories being opened between 1919-1938. The majority of the factories were opened in Slovenia, which had 47% of the factories, followed by Croatia at 37% and Serbia at 24%. The least industrialized regions were Kosovo and Macedonia, which 14% of the factories that were opened.

=== Debt ===
Yugoslavia was typical of Eastern European nations in that it borrowed large sums of money from the West during the 1920s. When the Great Depression began in 1929, the Western lenders called in their debts, which could not be paid back. Some of the money was lost to graft, although most was used by farmers to improve production and export potential. Agricultural exports, however, were always an unstable prospect as their export earnings were heavily reliant on volatile world market prices. The Great Depression caused the market for them to collapse as global demand contracted heavily and the situation for export-oriented farmers further deteriorated when nations everywhere started to erect trade barriers. Italy was a major trading partner of Yugoslavia in the initial years after World War I, but ties fell off after Benito Mussolini came to power in 1922. In the grim economic situation of the 1930s, Yugoslavia followed the lead of its neighbors in allowing itself to become a dependent of Nazi Germany.

=== Education ===
Although Yugoslavia had enacted a compulsory public education policy, it was inaccessible to many peasants in the countryside. Official literacy figures for the population stood at 50%, but it varied widely throughout the country. Less than 10% of Slovenes were illiterate, whereas over 80% of Macedonians and Bosnians could not read or write. Approximately 10% of initial elementary school students went on to attend higher forms of education, at one of the country&#x27;s three universities in Belgrade, Ljubljana, and Zagreb.

==Political history==

===Early politics===

Immediately after 1 December proclamation, negotiations between the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and the Serbian government resulted in agreement over the new government which was to be headed by Nikola Pašić. However, when this agreement was submitted to the approval of the regent, Alexander Karađorđević, it was rejected, producing the new state&#x27;s first governmental crisis. Many regarded this rejection as a violation of parliamentary principles, but the matter was resolved when the regent suggested replacing Pašić with Stojan Protić, a leading member of Pašić&#x27;s Radical Party. The National Council and the Serbian government agreed and the new government came into existence on 20 December 1918.

In this period before the election of the Constituent Assembly, a Provisional Representation served as a parliament which was formed by delegates from the various elected bodies that had existed before the creation of the state. A realignment of parties combining several members of the Serbian opposition with political parties from the former Austria-Hungary led to the creation of a new party, The Democratic Party, that dominated the Provisional Representation and the government.

Because the Democratic Party led by Ljubomir Davidović pushed a highly centralized agenda a number of Croatian delegates moved into opposition. However, the radicals themselves were not happy that they had only three ministers to the Democratic Party&#x27;s 11 and, on 16 August 1919, Protić handed in his resignation. Davidović then formed a coalition with the Social Democrats. This government had a majority, but the quorum of the Provisional Representation was half plus one vote. The opposition then began to boycott the parliament. As the government could never guarantee that all of its supporters would turn up, it became impossible to hold a quorate meeting of the parliament. Davidović soon resigned, but as no one else could form a government he again became prime minister. As the opposition continued their boycott, the government decided it had no alternative but to rule by decree. This was denounced by the opposition who began to style themselves as the Parliamentary Community. Davidović realized that the situation was untenable and asked the King to hold immediate elections for the Constituent Assembly. When the King refused, he felt he had no alternative but to resign.

The Parliamentary Community now formed a government led by Stojan Protić committed to the restoration of parliamentary norms and mitigating the centralization of the previous government. Their opposition to the former governments program of radical land reform also united them. As several small groups and individuals switched sides, Protić now even had a small majority. However, the Democratic Party and the Social Democrats now boycotted parliament and Protić was unable to muster a quorum. Hence the Parliamentary Community, now in government, was forced to rule by decree.

For the Parliamentary Community to thus violate the basic principle around which they had formed put them in an extremely difficult position. In April 1920, widespread worker unrest and a railway strike broke out. According to Gligorijević, this put pressure on the two main parties to settle their differences. After successful negotiations, Protić resigned to make way for a new government led by the neutral figure of Milenko Vesnić. The Social Democrats did not follow the Democratic Party, their former allies, into government because they were opposed to the anti-communist measures to which the new government was committed.

The controversies that had divided the parties earlier were still very much live issues. The Democratic Party continued to push its agenda of centralization and still insisted on the need for radical land reform. A disagreement over electoral law finally led the Democratic Party to vote against the government in Parliament and the government was defeated. Though this meeting had not been quorate, Vesnić used this as a pretext to resign. His resignation had the intended effect: the Radical Party agreed to accept the need for centralization, and the Democratic Party agreed to drop its insistence on land reform. Vesnić again headed the new government. The Croatian Community and the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party were however not happy with the Radicals&#x27; acceptance of centralization. Neither was Stojan Protić, and he withdrew from the government on this issue.

In September 1920 a peasant revolt broke out in Croatia, the immediate cause of which was the branding of the peasants&#x27; cattle. The Croatian community blamed the centralizing policies of the government and of minister Svetozar Pribićević in particular.

===Constituent assembly to dictatorship===
One of the few laws successfully passed by the Provisional Representation was the electoral law for the constituent assembly. During the negotiations that preceded the foundation of the new state, it had been agreed that voting would be secret and based on universal suffrage. It had not occurred to them that universal might include women until the beginning of a movement for women&#x27;s suffrage appeared with the creation of the new state. The Social Democrats and the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party supported women&#x27;s suffrage but the Radicals opposed it. The Democratic Party was open to the idea but not committed enough to make an issue of it so the proposal fell. Proportional Representation was accepted in principle but the system chosen (d&#x27;Hondt with very small constituencies) favored large parties and parties with strong regional support.

The election was held on 28 November 1920. When the votes were counted the Democratic Party had won the most seats, more than the Radicals – but only just. For a party that had been so dominant in the Provisional Representation, that amounted to a defeat. Further it had done rather badly in all former Austria-Hungarian areas. That undercut the party&#x27;s belief that its centralization policy represented the will of the Yugoslav people as a whole. The Radicals had done no better in that region but this presented them far less of a problem because they had campaigned openly as a Serbian party. The most dramatic gains had been made by the two anti-system parties. The Croatian Republican Peasant Party&#x27;s leadership had been released from prison only as the election campaign began to get underway. According to Gligorijević, this had helped them more than active campaigning. The Croatian community (that had in a timid way tried to express the discontent that Croatian Republican Peasant Party mobilized) had been too tainted by their participation in government and was all but eliminated. The other gainers were the communists who had done especially well in the wider Macedonia region. The remainder of the seats were taken up by smaller parties that were at best skeptical of the centralizing platform of the Democratic Party.

The results left Nikola Pašić in a very strong position as the Democrats had no choice but to ally with the Radicals if they wanted to get their concept of a centralized Yugoslavia through. Pašić was always careful to keep open the option of a deal with the Croatian opposition. The Democrats and the Radicals were not quite strong enough to get the constitution through on their own and they made an alliance with the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO). The Muslim party sought and got concessions over the preservation of Bosnia in its borders and how the land reform would affect Muslim landowners in Bosnia.

The Croatian Republican Peasant Party refused to swear allegiance to the King on the grounds that this presumed that Yugoslavia would be a monarchy, something that it contended only the Constituent Assembly could decide. The party was unable to take its seats. Most of the opposition though initially taking their seats declared boycotts as time went so that there were few votes against. However, the constitution decided against 1918 agreement between the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbia, which stated that a 66% majority that 50% plus one vote would be needed to pass, irrespective of how many voted against. Only last minute concessions to Džemijet, a group of Muslims from Macedonia and Kosovo, saved it.
On 28 June 1921, the Vidovdan Constitution was passed, establishing a unitary monarchy. The pre–World War I traditional regions were abolished and 33 new administrative &quot;oblasts&quot; (provinces) ruled from the center were instituted. During this time, King Peter I died (16 August 1921), and the prince-regent succeeded to the throne as King Alexander I.

Ljubomir Davidović of the Democrats began to have doubts about the wisdom of his party&#x27;s commitment to centralization and opened up negotiations with the opposition. This threatened to provoke a split in his party as his action was opposed by Svetozar Pribićević. It also gave Pašić a pretext to end the coalition. At first the King gave Pašić a mandate to form a coalition with Pribićević&#x27;s Democrats. However, Pašić offered Pribićević too little for there to be much chance that Pribićević would agree. A purely Radical government was formed with a mandate to hold elections. The Radicals made gains at the expense of the Democrats but elsewhere there were gains by Radić&#x27;s Peasant&#x27;s Party.

Serb politicians around Radic regarded Serbia as the standard bearer of Yugoslav unity, as the state of Piedmont had been for Italy, or Prussia for the German Empire; a kind of &quot;Greater Serbia&quot;. Over the following years, Croatian resistance against a Serbo-centric policy increased.

In the early 1920s, the Yugoslav government of prime minister Nikola Pašić used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets and other measure to rig elections. This was ineffective against the Croatian Peasant Party (formerly the Croatian Republican Peasant Party), whose members continued to win election to the Yugoslav parliament in large numbers, but did harm the Radicals&#x27; main Serbian rivals, the Democrats.

Stjepan Radić, the head of the Croatian Peasant Party, was imprisoned many times for political reasons. He was released in 1925 and returned to parliament.

In the spring of 1928, Radić and Svetozar Pribićević waged a bitter parliamentary battle against the ratification of the Nettuno Convention with Italy. In this they mobilised nationalist opposition in Serbia but provoked a violent reaction from the governing majority including death threats. On 20 June 1928, a member of the government majority, the Serb deputy Puniša Račić, shot five members of the Croatian Peasant Party, including their leader Stjepan Radić, after Radić refused to apologize for earlier offense in which he accused Račić of stealing from civilian population. Two died on the floor of the Assembly while the life of Radić hung in the balance.

The opposition now completely withdrew from parliament, declaring that they would not return to a parliament in which several of their representatives had been killed, and insisting on new elections. On 1 August, at a meeting in Zagreb, they renounced 1 December Declaration of 1920. They demanded that the negotiations for unification should begin from scratch. On 8 August Stjepan Radić died.

===6 January dictatorship===


On 6 January 1929, using as a pretext the political crisis triggered by the shooting, King Alexander abolished the Constitution, prorogued the Parliament and introduced a personal dictatorship (known as the &quot;January 6 Dictatorship&quot;, &quot;Šestosiječanjska diktatura&quot;, &quot;Šestojanuarska diktatura&quot;) with the aim of establishing the Yugoslav ideology and single Yugoslav nation. He changed the name of the country to &quot;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&quot;, and changed the internal divisions from the 33 oblasts to nine new &quot;banovinas&quot; on 3 October. This decision was made following a proposal by the British ambassador to better decentralize the country, modeled on Czechoslovakia. A Court for the Protection of the State was soon established to act as the new regime&#x27;s tool for putting down any dissent. Opposition politicians Vladko Maček and Svetozar Pribićević were arrested under charges by the court. Pribićević later went into exile, whereas over the course of the 1930s Maček would become the leader of the entire opposition bloc.

Immediately after the dictatorship was proclaimed, Croatian deputy Ante Pavelić left for exile from the country. The following years Pavelić worked to establish a revolutionary organization, the Ustaše, allied with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) against the state.

In 1931, Alexander decreed a new Constitution which made executive power the gift of the King. Elections were to be by universal male suffrage. The provision for a secret ballot was dropped, and pressure on public employees to vote for the governing party was to be a feature of all elections held under Alexander&#x27;s constitution. Further, half the upper house was directly appointed by the King, and legislation could become law with the approval of one of the houses alone if also approved by the King.

That same year, Croatian historian and anti-Yugoslavist intellectual Milan Šufflay was assassinated in Zagreb. As a response, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann sent an appeal to the International League of Human Rights in Paris condemning the murder, accusing the Yugoslav government. The letter states of a &quot;horrible brutality which is being practiced upon the Croatian People&quot;. The appeal was addressed to the Paris-based &quot;Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (Human Rights League). In their letter Einstein and Mann held the Yugoslav king Aleksandar explicitly responsible for these circumstances.

Croat opposition to the new régime was strong and, in late 1932, the Croatian Peasant Party issued the &quot;Zagreb Manifesto&quot; which sought an end to Serb hegemony and dictatorship. The government reacted by imprisoning many political opponents including the new Croatian Peasant Party leader Vladko Maček. Despite these measures, opposition to the dictatorship continued, with Croats calling for a solution to what was called the &quot;Croatian question&quot;. 

On 9 October 1934, the king was assassinated in Marseille, France, by Bulgarian Veličko Kerin (also known by his revolutionary pseudonym Vlado Chernozemski), an activist of IMRO, in a conspiracy with Yugoslav exiles and radical members of banned political parties in cooperation with the Croatian extreme nationalist Ustaše organisation.

===Yugoslav regency===

Because Aleksandar&#x27;s eldest son, Peter II, was a minor, a regency council of three, specified in Aleksandar&#x27;s will, took over the new king&#x27;s royal powers and duties. The council was dominated by the 11-year-old king&#x27;s first cousin once removed Prince Paul.

Prince Paul decided to appoint well-known economist Milan Stojadinović as prime minister in 1935. His solution to solving the economic problems left over from the Great Depression was to make trade deals and get closer to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The JRZ had majority support from Slovenes, Bosniaks, and Serbs. The only part missing was the support from Croats. This is why Milan Stojadinović called the JRZ regime a &quot;Three-Legged Chair&quot;, Stojadinović wrote in his memoirs: &quot;I called our party the three-legged chair, on which it was possible to sit when necessary, although a chair with four legs is far more stable&quot; - the fourth leg being the Croats, whose support was mostly behind the HSS. Prince Paul did not like this at first, but let him continue as long as it fixed the economy. Paul was concerned with rising tensions in Europe, especially with the Anschluss and the Munich Agreement Therefore, Paul ousted Milan Stojadinović replacing him with Dragiša Cvetković for being a Germanophile.

In the late 1930s, internal tensions continued to increase with Serbs and Croats seeking to establish ethnic federal subdivisions. Serbs wanted Vardar Banovina (later known within Yugoslavia as Vardar Macedonia), Vojvodina, Montenegro united with the Serb lands, and Croatia wanted Dalmatia and some of Vojvodina. Both sides claimed territory in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina populated also by Bosnian Muslims. The expansion of Nazi Germany in 1938 gave new momentum to efforts to solve these problems and, in 1939, Prince Paul appointed Dragiša Cvetković as prime minister, with the goal of reaching an agreement with the Croatian opposition. Accordingly, on 26 August 1939, Vladko Maček became vice premier of Yugoslavia and an autonomous Banovina of Croatia was established with its own parliament.

These changes satisfied neither Serbs, who were concerned with the status of the Serb minority in the new Banovina of Croatia and who wanted more of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Serbian territory, nor the Croatian nationalist Ustaše, who were also angered by any settlement short of full independence for a Greater Croatia including all of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===Downfall===

Fearing an invasion by the Axis powers, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941, pledging cooperation with the Axis. Massive anti-Axis demonstrations followed in Belgrade.

On 27 March, the regime of Prince Paul was overthrown by a military coup d&#x27;état with British support. The 17-year-old Peter II was declared to be of age and placed in power. General Dušan Simović became his Prime Minister. Yugoslavia withdrew its support for the Axis &quot;de facto&quot; without formally renouncing the Tripartite Pact. Although the new rulers opposed Nazi Germany, they also feared that if Germany attacked Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom was not in any real position to help. Regardless of this, on 6 April 1941, the Axis powers launched the invasion of Yugoslavia and quickly conquered it. The royal family, including Prince Paul, escaped abroad and were kept under house arrest in British Kenya.

Yugoslavia was soon divided by the Axis into several entities. Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria annexed some border areas outright. A Greater Germany was expanded to include most of Slovenia. Italy added the Governorship of Dalmatia, part of Macedonia and Kosovo, Montenegro, southerly part of Croatia, and more than a third of western Slovenia to the Italian Empire. An expanded Croatia was recognized by the Axis as the Independent State of Croatia (&quot;Nezavisna Država Hrvatska&quot;, NDH). On paper, the NDH was a kingdom and the 4th Duke of Aosta was crowned as King Tomislav II of Croatia, but in reality the King was merely a figurehead and the real power was held by &quot;Poglavnik&quot; Ante Pavelić. The rump territory became a military administration of Germany run by military governors and a Serb civil government led by Milan Nedić. Nedić attempted to gain German recognition of Territory of Serbia as a successor state to Yugoslavia and claimed King Peter II as Serbia&#x27;s monarch. Hungary occupied several northern regions.

Following the July 1943 fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, Tomislav II abdicated from his Croatian throne and Pavelić assumed direct control over the NDH, annexing the Italian Governorate of Dalmatia in the process. After the invasion of Italy by the Axis powers in September 1943, the Italian governorates in Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia and Slovenia were occupied by the Germans and placed under direct German control.

===Exile of the king===
King Peter II, who had escaped into exile, was still recognized as King of the whole state of Yugoslavia by the Allies. From 13 May 1941, the largely Serb guerilla force, Chetniks (&quot;Yugoslav Army of the Fatherland&quot;, &quot;Jugoslovenska vojska u otadžbini&quot;, or JVUO) resisted the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia and supported Peter II. This resistance movement, which was both anti-German and anti-communist, was commanded by Royalist General Draža Mihailović. For a long time, the Chetniks were supported by the British, the United States, and the Yugoslav royal government in exile of King Peter II.

However, over the course of the war, effective power changed to the hands of Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Communist Partisans. In 1943, Tito proclaimed the creation of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia (&quot;Demokratska federativna Jugoslavija&quot;). The Allies gradually recognized Tito&#x27;s forces as the stronger opposition forces to the German occupation. They began to send most of their aid to Tito&#x27;s Partisans, rather than to the Royalist Chetniks. On 16 June 1944, the Tito–Šubašić agreement was signed which merged the &quot;de facto&quot; and the &quot;de jure&quot; government of Yugoslavia.

In early 1945, after the Germans had been driven out, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formally restored, however real political power was held by Tito&#x27;s Communist Partisans. On 29 November, King Peter II was deposed (and the monarchy abolished) by Yugoslavia&#x27;s Communist Constituent Assembly while he was still in exile. On 2 December, the Communist authorities claimed the entire territory as part of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia. The new Yugoslavia covered roughly the same territory as the Kingdom had, now a federal republic ruled by the Communist Party rather than a unitary monarchy.

==Foreign policy==
===Pro-Allied government===
The Kingdom nourished a close relationship with the Allies of World War I. This was especially the case between 1920 and 1934 with Yugoslavia&#x27;s traditional supporters of Britain and France.

====Little Entente====
From 1920, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had formed the &quot;Little Entente&quot; with Czechoslovakia and Romania, with the support of France. The primary aim of the alliance was to prevent Hungary from regaining the territories it had lost after the First World War. The alliance lost its significance in 1937 when Yugoslavia and Romania refused to support Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, in the event of military aggression.

====Balkan alliances====
In 1934, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia formed a &quot;Balkan Bloc&quot; with Greece, Romania, and Turkey that was intent on keeping balance on the Balkan peninsula. The alliance was formalized and entrenched on 9 February 1934 when it became the &quot;Balkan Entente&quot;. In 1934, with the assassination of King Alexander I by Vlado Chernozemski in Marseille and the shifting of Yugoslav foreign policy, the alliance crumbled.

====Tensions with Italy====
The Kingdom of Italy had territorial ambitions against the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Relations between Italy and the kingdom&#x27;s predecessors, the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs became sour and hostile during World War I, as Italian and Yugoslav politicians were in dispute over the region of Dalmatia which Italy demanded as part of Italy. These hostile relations were demonstrated on 1 November 1918, when Italian forces sunk the recently captured Austro-Hungarian battleship SMS Viribus Unitis being used by the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.

Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini accepted the extreme Croatian nationalist Ustase movement of Ante Pavelić to reside in Italy and use training grounds in Italy to prepare for war with Yugoslavia. Hungary also permitted such Ustase training camps as well. Mussolini allowed Pavelić to reside in Rome.

=====Friendship agreement=====
In 1927, in response to the growing Italian expansionism, the royal government of Yugoslavia signed an agreement of friendship and cooperation with the United Kingdom and France.

===1935–1941===
Officially, the last words of King Aleksandar had been &quot;Save Yugoslavia, and the friendship with France&quot;. His successors were well aware of the need to try and do the first, but the second, maintaining close ties with France, was increasingly difficult. There were several reasons for this. By the mid-1930s, France, internally divided, was increasingly unable to play an important role in Eastern Europe and support its allies, many of whom had suffered badly from the economic crisis of that period. By contrast, Germany was increasingly willing to get into barter agreements with the countries of south east Europe. In the process those countries felt it was against their interests to closely follow France. An additional motive to improve relations with Italy and Germany was Italy&#x27;s support of the Ustase movement. As Maček intimated Italy would support Croatian secession from Yugoslavia, First Regent Prince Paul judged closer relations with Italy were inevitable. In an effort to rob the HSS from potential Italian support, a treaty of friendship was signed between the two countries in 1937. This diminished the Ustasa threat somewhat since Mussolini imprisoned some of their leaders and temporarily withdrew financial support. In 1938, Germany, annexing Austria, became a neighbour of Yugoslavia. The feeble reaction of France and Britain, later that year, during the Sudeten Crisis convinced Belgrade that a European war was inevitable and that it would be unwise to support France and Britain. Instead, Yugoslavia tried to stay aloof, this in spite of Paul&#x27;s personal sympathies for Britain and Serbia&#x27;s establishment&#x27;s predilections for France. In the meantime, Germany and Italy tried to exploit Yugoslavia&#x27;s domestic problems, and so did Maček. In the end, the regency agreed to the formation of the Banovina of Croatia in August 1939. This did not put an end to the pressures from Germany and Italy, and Yugoslavia&#x27;s strategic position deteriorated by the day. It was increasingly dependent on the German market, about 90% of its exports went to Germany, and in April 1939 Italy invaded and annexed Albania. In October 1940 it attacked Greece, by when France had already been eliminated from the scene, leaving Britain as Yugoslavia&#x27;s only potential ally – given that Belgrade had not recognized the Soviet Union. London however wanted to involve Yugoslavia in the war, which it rejected.

From late 1940, Hitler wanted Belgrade to unequivocally choose sides. Pressure intensified, culminating in the signing of the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later, Prince Paul was deposed in a coup d&#x27;état and his nephew Peter II was proclaimed of age, but the new government, headed by General Simović, assured Germany it would adhere to the Pact. Hitler nonetheless ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia. On 6 April 1941, Belgrade was bombed; on 10 April, the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed; and on 17 April, the weak Yugoslav Army capitulated.

===1941–1945===
After the invasion, the Yugoslav royal government went into exile and local Yugoslav forces rose up in resistance to the occupying Axis powers. Initially the monarchy preferred Draža Mihailović and his Serb-dominated Četnik resistance. However, in 1944, the Tito–Šubašić agreement recognised the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia as a provisional government, with the status of the monarchy to be decided at a later date. Three regentsSrđan Budisavljević, a Serb; Ante Mandić, a Croat; and Dušan Sernec, a Slovenewere sworn in at Belgrade on 3 March 1945. They appointed the new government, to be headed by Tito as prime minister and minister of war, with Šubašić as foreign minister, on 7 March.

On 29 November 1945, while still in exile, King Peter II was deposed by the constituent assembly. The Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia was internationally recognized as Yugoslavia and Peter II became a pretender.
==Demographics==

=== Ethnic groups===
The small middle class occupied the major population centers and almost everyone else were peasants engaged in subsistence agriculture. The largest ethnic group were Serbs followed by Croats and Slovenes, as three constitutive peoples of the Kingdom, while Montenegrins, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians were not recognized as distinctive ethnic groups; further historical minority groups included Germans, Italians, Hungarians, Slovaks, Jews and Rusyns. Religion followed the same pattern with half the population following Orthodox Christianity, around 40% Roman Catholicism and most of the rest Sunni Islam. Beside &quot;Serbo-Croato-Slovene&quot; (which includes Macedonian, then recognized as a southern dialect of Serbian), the most widely spoken languages by number of speakers were Albanian, Italian, Hungarian, German, Slovak and Rusyn.

In a multiethnic, multireligious and multilinguistic society, ethnic tensions and regional interests commonly surfaced in both politics and daily life, especially between the two largest and most influential groups who monopolized all political power in the country, the Serbs and Croats. Other quarrels were those between Serbs and Macedonians, as the Yugoslav government had as its official position that the latter were ethnic Serbs from &quot;Old Serbia&quot; (). In the early 20th century the international community viewed the Macedonians predominantly as regional variety of Bulgarians on linguistic basis and cultural similarities, but during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Allies sanctioned the Serbian control of Vardar Macedonia and its view, that Macedonian Slavs were in fact Southern Serbs. Bulgarian politicians later interpreted the decision as punishment for it being a Central Power during World War I and as sanctioned Serbian irredentism.

Rights of the Muslim minority were never enshrined in law but concessions were made to accommodate for religious relativism. Some regions of the country were allowed to exist as enclaves of Islamic law.

Aside from Vlachs, the Yugoslav government awarded no special treatment to non-Slavic ethnic minorities in terms of respect for their language, culture, or political autonomy.

Until 1929, Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were the constitutional nations, when they were merged into a single &quot;Yugoslav&quot; nationality. With the language of the country being institutionalized and mandatory, ethnic minorities were expected to gradually assimilate into the Yugoslav panethnic identity.

=== Persecution of Albanians ===
From the end of World War I to the beginning of World War II in Yugoslavia, ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia were subject to persecution. The discrimination faced by the Albanians existed in the forms of deportations, mass killings, executions, imprisonment, etc. The Yugoslav authorities attempted to colonize Kosovo to change its ethnic character. There were a number of massacres that took place in Kosovo and Montenegro, some of which were reported by Sherman Miles to the United States Department of State in May 1919. During the interwar period, between 90,000 and 300,000 Albanians were deported from Yugoslavia.

==Subdivisions==
The subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia existed successively in three different forms. From 1918 to 1922, the kingdom maintained the pre–World War I subdivisions of Yugoslavia&#x27;s predecessor states. In 1922, the state was divided into thirty-three &quot;oblasts&quot; (provinces). In 1929, after the establishment of the January 6 Dictatorship, a new system of nine &quot;banovinas&quot; (regions) was implemented by royal decree. In 1939, as an accommodation to Yugoslav Croats in the Cvetković-Maček Agreement, a single Banovina of Croatia was formed from two of these &quot;banovinas&quot; (and from sections of others).

==Sport==

The most popular sport in the Kingdom was association football. The Yugoslav Football Association was founded in Zagreb in 1919. It was based in Zagreb until the 6 January Dictatorship, when the association was moved to Belgrade. From 1923, a national championship was held annually. The national team played its first match at the 1920 Summer Olympics. It also participated in the inaugural FIFA World Cup, finishing fourth.

Other popular sports included water polo, which was dominated nationally by the Croatian side VK Jug.

The Kingdom participated at the Olympic Games from 1920 until 1936. During this time, the country won eight medals, all in gymnastics and six of these were won by Leon Štukelj, a Slovene who was the most nominated gymnast of that time.

<text>Westron (called Adûni in Westron, or Sôval Phârë meaning &quot;Common Speech&quot; in Westron), is the constructed language that was supposedly the Common Speech used in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s world of Middle-earth in the Third Age, at the time of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It ostensibly developed from Adûnaic, the ancient language of Númenor. In practice in the novel, Westron is nearly always represented by modern English, in a process of pseudo-translation which also sees Rohirric represented by Old English. That process allowed Tolkien not to develop Westron or Rohirric in any detail. In the Appendices of the novel, Tolkien gives some examples of Westron words.

== Context ==

From his schooldays, J. R. R. Tolkien was, in the words of his biographer John Garth, &quot;effusive about philology&quot;; his schoolfriend Rob Gilson called him &quot;quite a great authority on etymology&quot;. Tolkien was a professional philologist, a scholar of comparative and historical linguistics. He was especially familiar with Old English and related languages. He remarked to the poet and &quot;The New York Times&quot; book reviewer Harvey Breit that &quot;I am a philologist and all my work is philological&quot;; he explained to his American publisher Houghton Mifflin that this was meant to imply that his work was &quot;all of a piece, and fundamentally linguistic in inspiration. ... The invention of languages is the foundation. The &#x27;stories&#x27; were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows.&quot;

Tolkien created a large family of Elvish languages, the best-known and most developed being Quenya and Sindarin. In addition, he sketched in the Mannish languages of Westron&#x27;s precursor, Adûnaic, and Rohirric; the Dwarvish language of Khuzdul; the Entish language; and the Black Speech of the Orcs.

== Linguistic mapping ==

When writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–55), a sequel to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937), Tolkien came up with the literary device of using real languages to &quot;translate&quot; fictional languages. He pretended that he had not composed the book himself but translated it from Westron (named &quot;Adûni&quot; in Westron) or Common Speech (&quot;Sôval Phârë&quot;, in Westron) into English. The purpose of this was to provide an explanation for why the Common Speech is almost entirely rendered as English in the novel. This device of rendering an &quot;imaginary&quot; language with a &quot;real&quot; one was carried further by rendering:

* Rohirric, the language of Rohan (related to Westron) by the Mercian dialect of Old English;
* names in the tongue of Dale by Old Norse forms;
* names of the Kingdom of Rhovanion by Gothic forms, thus mapping the genetic relation of his fictional languages on to the existing historical relations of the Germanic languages.

The whole device of linguistic mapping was essentially a fix for the problems Tolkien had created for himself by using real Norse names for the Dwarves in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, rather than inventing new names in Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves. This seemed a clever solution, as it allowed him to explain the book&#x27;s use of Modern English as representing Westron. Because of this, Tolkien did not need to develop Westron grammar or vocabulary in any detail. 

Tolkien went further, using Gothic names for the early leaders of the Northmen of Rhovanion, ancestors of Rohan, and for the first Kings of Rohan. Gothic was an East Germanic language, and as such is a forerunner of Old English, not a direct ancestor. Christopher Tolkien suggests that his father intended the correspondence between the language families to extend back to the ancestral language of the Northmen. 

== Language ==

Westron (also called Adûni) supposedly developed from Adûnaic, the ancient language of Númenor. It became the lingua franca for all the peoples of Middle-earth: Tolkien gives some examples of Westron words in Appendix F to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, where he summarizes Westron&#x27;s origin and role as &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Middle-earth:

He explains further that:

Tolkien gives a few names in Westron, saying that &quot;Karningul&quot; was the translation of Elvish &quot;Imladris&quot;, Rivendell, while &quot;Sûza&quot; was Westron for the Shire. Hobbit surnames Took and Boffin were &quot;anglicize[d]&quot; from Westron &quot;Tûk&quot; and &quot;Bophîn&quot;. The original form of Brandybuck was &quot;Zaragamba&quot;, &quot;Oldbuck&quot;, from Westron &quot;zara&quot;, &quot;old&quot;, and &quot;gamba&quot;, &quot;buck&quot;. He explains, too, that Sam[wise] and Ham[fast] &quot;were really called &quot;Ban&quot; and &quot;Ran&quot;&quot;, shortened from Westron &quot;Banazîr&quot; and &quot;Ranugad&quot;. Tolkien states that these had been nicknames, meaning &quot;halfwise, simple&quot; and &quot;stay-at-home&quot;, which he had chosen to render by English names, from Old English &quot;samwís&quot; and &quot;hámfoest&quot; with equivalent meanings. Nick Groom states that &quot;Sûza&quot;, &quot;Banazîr&quot;, and the Westron for Sam&#x27;s surname &quot;Gamgee&quot;, &quot;Galbasi&quot;, are all derived from Gothic, a precursor of Old English, adding a further layer of linguistic complexity to the pseudotranslation.

The word &quot;Hobbit&quot;, which Tolkien&#x27;s fictional persona, the narrator of the appendices, admits &quot;is an invention&quot;, could, he explains, easily be a much-worn form of the Old English &quot;holbytla&quot;, &quot;hole-dweller&quot;. This corresponds to the Westron dialect form &quot;kuduk&quot;, used in Bree and the Shire, which the narrator supposes was probably a worn form of the word &quot;kûd-dûkan&quot;, of the same meaning, stating that Merry had heard King Théoden of Rohan use this name for &quot;Hobbit&quot;.

<doc id="232272" wikidata="Q1300686" url="?curid=232272" title="Altamira oriole">
<text>The Altamira oriole (Icterus gularis) is a New World oriole. The bird is widespread in subtropical lowlands of the Mexican Gulf Coast and northern Central America, the Pacific coast and inland. They have since spread to southern Texas, but this was not until 1939.

At and , this is the largest oriole in genus &quot;Icterus&quot;. The bird nests in open woodland, with the nest being a very long woven pouch, attached to the end of a horizontal tree branch, sometimes to telephone wires.

This bird forages high in trees, sometimes in the undergrowth. They mainly eat insects and berries.

These birds are permanent residents, and unlike the migratory orioles that breed in the US, the species is sexually monomorphic—both the males and the females have elaborate coloration and patterning.

==Description==
Both males and females have a black mandible and throat, as well as a black back and long black tail. Wings are black, but the remiges and rectrices (flight feathers) are fringed with white. These form a single white wing bar and white wing spots when folded. The secondary coverts form orange epaulets. The underside is almost uniformly orange or yellowish-orange. In general, immature specimens have an olive back, and a dull yellow on its head and its body. The first-year bird is similar to the adult, but it has an olive, not black, back, and yellow-olive tail.

==Behavior==

The bird lives in semi-arid areas with scattered trees, and open riparian woodland. The bird is a solitary nester as well, with an average of a quarter kilometer between nests. Little aggression has been observed in breeding season from this bird, and it is not known to be territorial.

=== Reproduction ===
In Texas, their breeding season ranges from late April to late July. Their nest resembles a small pouch made of moss, grass, palm fibers, weeds, strips of bark, and is lined with feathers. The nest may also hang from telephone wires. The nest is assumed to be built by the female, but it is not known how long this takes. 4–6 eggs are laid, and nestlings are fed and cared for by both parents.

=== Diet ===
The Altamira oriole is a forage gleaner, searching for food through the tree-tops to the near-ground bottom of the tree. Its diet includes fruit (small fruits, hackberries and figs) and insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets, and caterpillars.

===Voice===
The song of the Altamira oriole is a series of clear, slow musical whistles. In contrast, the Altamira&#x27;s calls are harsh whistles, rasping chatter, and nasal &quot;ike&quot;s.

<doc id="232273" wikidata="Q1126243" url="?curid=232273" title="Connecticut Sun">
<text>The Connecticut Sun are an American professional basketball team based in Uncasville, Connecticut. The Sun compete in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) as a member of the Eastern Conference. The team is currently the only major league professional sports team based in Connecticut.

The team was established as the Orlando Miracle in 1999, during the league&#x27;s expansion from ten to twelve teams, as a sister team to the NBA&#x27;s Orlando Magic. In 2003, as financial strains left the team on the brink of disbanding, the Mohegan Indian tribe purchased and relocated the team to Mohegan Sun, becoming the first Native American tribe to own a professional sports franchise. The team&#x27;s name comes from its affiliation with Mohegan Sun and its logo is reflective of a modern interpretation of an ancient Mohegan symbol. Capitalizing on the popularity of women&#x27;s basketball in the state, as a result of the success of the UConn Huskies, the Sun held the distinction of being the only WNBA franchise not to share its market with an NBA team, until the relocation of the Seattle SuperSonics in 2008 left the Storm as an independent team in Seattle.

The Sun have qualified for the WNBA playoffs in 15 of their 21 seasons in Connecticut. Despite this, they are the oldest remaining franchise without a championship title.

==History==

===Orlando Miracle (1999–2002)===
Before the franchise relocated to Connecticut in 2003, the team operated as the Orlando Miracle. The Miracle played their home games at TD Waterhouse Centre in Orlando, Florida, as the sister team of the Orlando Magic. After the 2002 season, the NBA sold off all of the WNBA franchises to the operators of the respective teams, which placed the league in the middle of team contractions, relocations, and potential labor strife. Since Magic ownership was no longer interested in retaining the rights to the Miracle and no local partnership was reached, the organization ceased operations and was purchased by the Mohegan Tribe. On January 28, 2003, it was announced that the Miracle would immediately move to Uncasville, Connecticut and change its nickname to the Sun (in reference to the Mohegan Sun casino). The Sun&#x27;s nickname, color scheme and logo are similar to that of another defunct Florida-based franchise, the Miami Sol, which folded at the same time as the Miracle&#x27;s relocation to Connecticut.

===Relocation and ascendancy to prominence (2003–2004)===

With a new home in Uncasville and two former UConn Huskies on the roster, the Sun entered the 2003 season looking to build upon a 2002 campaign in which they missed the playoffs due to a tiebreaker with Indiana. The Sun underwent a total overhaul during the off-season – selecting Debbie Black in the dispersal draft and acquiring former Connecticut star Rebecca Lobo to add another local attraction to join Nykesha Sales. General manager Chris Sienko named Mike Thibault, a coaching veteran with two NBA titles as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers, as the first head coach for the franchise.

On May 24, 2003, the Sun hosted the first regular season game of its inaugural season, which was shown on ABC, the league&#x27;s new broadcast partner. The Sun yielded to the two-time defending champion Sparks before a sellout crowd of 9,341. At the conclusion of the 2003 season, the Sun finished with an 18–16 record, which clinched the first playoff berth since the franchise relocated. The Sun swept the second-seeded Sting in the first round of the playoffs, and before being swept by the Detroit Shock in the Eastern Conference Finals.

Rebecca Lobo announced her retirement after seven seasons in the WNBA. The Sun returned Katie Douglas, Nykesha Sales and Taj McWilliams-Franklin, the group that formed Thibault&#x27;s nucleus. General manager Chris Sienko fortified that core with former UConn product Asjha Jones, who was acquired in a three-team trade, and Minnesota Golden Gophers phenom Lindsay Whalen, who was taken with the fourth overall pick in the 2004 Draft. The Sun managed to snag a top pick in one of the deepest draft classes in league history by trading perennial all-star point guard Shannon Johnson. The Sun selected Lindsay Whalen amidst rumors they would trade her to the Minnesota Lynx. However, she remained on the team as the Sun posted an 18–16 record in an equally-talented Eastern Conference, winning the #1 seed. In the first round, the Sun defeated the Washington Mystics 2–1. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sun rolled on, sweeping the New York Liberty. The Sun had made it to the WNBA Finals in their second season of existence. In the Finals, their run would end, as they lost a hard-fought three-game series, 2–1, to the Seattle Storm.

===Dynastic turmoil (2005–2007)===
In the 2005 offseason, the Sun acquired 7&#x27;2&quot; (2.18 m) center Margo Dydek. With a dominant post presence, the Sun controlled the Eastern Conference, posting a 26–8 record, the best regular season record for an Eastern Conference team in WNBA history. In the playoffs, the Sun flew to the finals, sweeping the Detroit Shock and the Indiana Fever. In the 2005 WNBA Finals, the Sun were matched up against an equally dominant Sacramento Monarchs team while having to deal with injuries to Lindsay Whalen. Despite having home-court advantage, the Sun lost in four games in the first ever best-of-five format WNBA Finals.

The success of the franchise was rewarded in 2005, when the Sun were selected to host the annual WNBA All-Star Game. Sun coach Mike Thibault served as coach for the Eastern Conference, which lost 122-99. At the end of the game, Lisa Leslie became the first woman to ever dunk in an All-Star Game.

In 2006, the Sun would match their 2005 record. Mike Thibault received the WNBA Coach of the Year Award while all five starters were named to the WNBA Eastern Conference All-Star team: Katie Douglas, Margo Dydek, Taj McWilliams-Franklin, Nykesha Sales and Lindsay Whalen. In the playoffs, the Sun beat the Washington Mystics 76-61 in the first game and 68-65 in the second. But in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sun lost to the Detroit Shock 1-3, where Connecticut hosted the last game.

The Sun stumbled out of the gate in 2007, posting a dismal 5–10 record by late June. However, the Sun stormed back into playoff contention by winning 11 of their next 13 games, to finish the regular season at 18–16, enough to win the #3 seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Sun faced the Indiana Fever in the first round. The Sun came into the series having won all four regular season contests against the Fever. In game 1, despite holding a 17-point lead in the third quarter, the Fever raced back to force overtime. The game went into three overtimes, the first time it had happened in WNBA playoff history, ending with a 93–88 victory for the Sun. However, the Fever would respond by winning the next two games and therefore the series, including a playoff record 22-point come-from-behind win in Game 3.

===Brief decline (2008–2009)===
During the 2007–08 offseason, the Connecticut Sun made major changes to their roster in an effort to win that ever-elusive championship title. The Sun made three trades, one sending Katie Douglas to the Indiana Fever. In return, the Sun received Tamika Whitmore. Following the monumental trade, Nykesha Sales announced she would sit out the 2008 season due to multiple nagging injuries. 7&#x27;2&quot; center Margo Dydek also took the season off due to her pregnancy.

With a lineup with three new starters, the Sun started the season by winning eight of their first nine games. The team did slow in progression by losing five games in a row at one point, but they finished the regular season with a 21–13 record, which placed them second in the Eastern Conference, only one game out of first place. In the playoffs, the New York Liberty won the decisive game three on the Sun&#x27;s home floor and for the second straight year, the Sun failed to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. 

The 2009 WNBA All-Star Game was held on July 25 at 3:30 p.m. at Mohegan Sun Arena, the second time the Sun had hosted the game. It was broadcast nationally on ABC (HD). The 2009 season would prove to be a middling one for the team, which fought to stay around .500 the entire season. An injury to Asjha Jones did not help their chances, and the team ultimately finished 16–18, which was the same record as the Washington Mystics and Chicago Sky for fourth place, but Washington won the tiebreaker to advance.

===Charles triggers resurgence (2010–2012)===

Connecticut started its rebuilding process by acquiring DeMya Walker in the dispersal draft of the Sacramento Monarchs, which was held on December 14, 2009. The Sun then snagged the first overall pick in the 2010 collegiate draft in a trade with the Minnesota Lynx; a trade that saw Lindsay Whalen along with the second overall pick traded to Minneapolis. This package netted the Sun Renee Montgomery. Thibault continued to reshape his roster after introducing Kara Lawson at a press conference as a new member of the Sun. Lawson, along with Montgomery was meant to shape a formidable backcourt, which would go with their plans in signing reserves Anete Jēkabsone-Žogota and Tan White.

The Sun came into the 2010 WNBA draft with two picks in the first round – the first and seventh overall picks, the latter of which was acquired one day prior to the draft from the Tulsa Shock. With its first overall selection in franchise history, the Sun took UConn standout and Player of the Year recipient, Tina Charles, the consensus top prospect available. To diminish the losses of Amber Holt and Chante Black, both of whom were part of the package deal with the Shock, the Sun selected Kansas product Danielle McCray. Prior to the draft, it was understood that McCray wouldn&#x27;t be available to participate in the upcoming season due to an ACL injury she sustained in college. There was risk involved concerning her durability, but McCray&#x27;s potential as a superstar was reason enough to take the leap of faith. The Sun cemented its guard corps with the selection of Allison Hightower in the second round. He then nabbed former Cornhusker Kelsey Griffin, who was taken third overall, in a trade once again involving the Lynx. This trade would have the Sun relinquishing their first and second round picks in next year&#x27;s draft. After the 2010 WNBA season (after going 17-17 and missing the playoffs), news surfaced that the Connecticut Sun was the first franchise in WNBA history to turn a profit.

The 2011 season started well for the Sun. Few changes were made in the off-season, which gave the team some consistency and a year of experience on which to build. Sandrine Gruda and Anete Jēkabsone-Žogota decided to sit out the season, so the Sun looked elsewhere, adding Jessica Moore. In a tough Eastern Conference, the Sun held a 9–5 record going into the All-Star break and finished 21-13 before losing in the Conference Semifinals. The 2012 offseason saw them try to build their team in small ways with a free agency approach – making small waves to pry Thompson and Cash from their respective teams and then getting forward Mistie Mims The team had won 13 of their first 17 games before finishing 25-9 to finish 1st in the Eastern Conference. 

The Sun fended off the Liberty in two close semifinal games to face the Indiana Fever in what was the team&#x27;s first Conference finals since 2010. They won Game 1 76–64 in Connecticut to find themselves one win away from the Finals. However, the Fever struck back with a close victory in Game 2 that saw Shavonte Zellous hit a two-point jump shot with 0.5 seconds remaining to provide the winning points in a 78–76 loss. Back in Connecticut, the Fever got onto a hot start and the Sun (who missed their first thirteen shots from the 3-point line) never recovered. The Fever, who had never won a road elimination playoff game, won 87–71. After the season, Tina Charles was named WNBA Most Valuable Player Award while Montgomery was named WNBA Sixth Woman of the Year Award. On November 20, Thibault (along with his two assistants) was fired with one year remaining on his contract; he had gone 206–134 in ten seasons as coach.

===Change at the top (2013–2016)===
With an eye to accomplishing the objective of a WNBA title, the team hired Hall of Famer Anne Donovan as Thibault&#x27;s successor. Among other WNBA stints, Donovan was the head coach of the 2004 Seattle Storm team that captured the league title over Connecticut. Donovan hired Catherine Proto and Jennifer Gillom as her assistant coaches for her initial season. In 2014, Proto became Scouting and Video Operations Manager for the Sun and Steven Key replaced her as an assistant coach. During Anne Donovan&#x27;s run as head coach, she would go 38–64 in three seasons with the Connecticut Sun before resigning as the head coach in 2015. Curt Miller would be named head coach of the Connecticut Sun starting in 2016.

During this period, the Sun also hosted two more WNBA All-Star Games at Mohegan Sun Arena. Connecticut acted as host for the 2013 and 2015 contests.

===A new era (2016–present)===
With Curt Miller at the helm, changes were made. Elizabeth Williams was sent to the Atlanta Dream for the 2016 fourth overall pick in Rachel Banham. In April 2016, the Sun traded Chelsea Gray to the Los Angeles Sparks along with two second round picks in the 2016 WNBA Draft and a 2017 first round pick for Jonquel Jones and the Sparks second round selection in the 2016 WNBA Draft. In the 2016 WNBA Draft, the Connecticut Sun selected Morgan Tuck with their third overall draft pick. After getting three wins in sixteen games on the 2016 season, the Sun moved Kelsey Bone to the Phoenix Mercury for Courtney Williams and a second round draft selection in the 2017 WNBA Draft. Closing out the 2016 WNBA Season the Sun would win eleven out of the remaining twenty games to finish with a record of 14–20, missing out on the postseason by three wins. 

In February 2017, the Sun would trade Camille Little to the Phoenix Mercury for Lynetta Kizer from the Indiana Fever and eighth overall draft selection Brionna Jones in the 2017 WNBA Draft from a three team trade. Ahead of the 2017 WNBA Season, Chiney Ogwumike was suspended due to an injury she suffered overseas causing her to miss the 2017 WNBA Season. By the halfway point of the season, they were 10–7. By the end of the season, they had won 21 games with 13 losses to narrowly finish one game out of 1st place in the East to reach their first postseason in five years. In the one-game Second Round, they lost to the Phoenix Mercury 88–83. Chiney returned to action in the 2018 WNBA Season while Stricklen resigned for another run with the Connecticut Sun. 

The 2019 team continued on the run from last year, as they finished with a 23–11 record to finish as the second best team in the league overall and earn a bye to the Semifinals. In the best-of-five round, they won in a three-game sweep over the Los Angeles Sparks to meet the Washington Mystics, now coached by former Sun Mike Thibault. In the first WNBA Finals in Connecticut in 14 years, with the #1 Mystics having home-court advantage. The teams split the first two games before Washington won Game 3 94–81. A sixteen-point halftime lead for the Sun in Game 4 proved important when the attempted comeback of the Mystics came short in a 90–86 decision. In Game 5, the Sun led by two points going into the final quarter. However, the Mystics overpowered them with 27 fourth quarter points to the 14 of the Sun to win 89–78 for the championship. 

The 2020 season was meant to have a new record of games played with 36. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the WNBA to announce a change to the plan that would instead see 22 games played without fans at IMG Academy in Florida. In a twelve-team league that would see eight teams make the playoffs, the Sun went 10–12 to make it as the seventh seed. They won the first two playoff games to reach the Semifinals against the Las Vegas Aces. They won two of the first three games to be on the verge of the WNBA Finals. However, they lost 75–84 and 63–66 to fall short. 

The 2021 team returned with 32 games played where they lost only six times to clinch the #1 overall seed. The 26 wins tied a franchise record and gave them a bye to the Semifinals. They met the Chicago Sky, who beat them as a #6 seed by winning in four games, which included a 101–95 Game 1 win in double overtime. 

In 2022, now with the 36-game schedule, the Sun went 25–11 to finish 3rd. They beat the Dallas Wings in the First Round to make the Semifinals, where they narrowly beat the Chicago Sky in five games to reach the WNBA Finals for the second time in four seasons. Facing the #1 seed Las Vegas Aces, the Aces narrowly won Game 1 67–64 and then rolled to a 14-point win in Game 2. The Sun scored 105 points in Game 3 back home, but the Aces prevailed in Game 4 78–71 to win the championship.

===&quot;The Mohegan Sun Massacre&quot;===
In early 2025, during free agency, the Sun traded away three of their previous starting five players while DeWanna Bonner signed with the Indiana Fever and the Phoenix Mercury acquired Alyssa Thomas in a sign and trade deal. It marked the first time in WNBA history that a starting five was completely dismantled after a playoff appearance.

===Current home===
The Sun play in the Mohegan Sun Arena. Mohegan Sun is owned by the Mohegan tribe. The arena is located at Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. Despite the inclusion of “Connecticut” in the name, the team technically isn’t under the jurisdiction of the State of Connecticut as Native American tribes are sovereign entities and the Mohegan Sun Arena is located on the Mohegan reservation, though the team is still considered to be located in Connecticut. Mohegan Sun Arena is smaller than most other WNBA arenas, with the maximum capacity (lower and upper levels) for a basketball game being 9,323. The Sun is the only top-level professional sports franchises located in the state of Connecticut. The New England Black Wolves of the National Lacrosse League formerly shared the Mohegan Sun Arena with the Sun until their relocation in 2020. 

The Mohegan Sun Arena is located in the center of the mall area of the Mohegan Sun Casino.

==Media coverage==
Currently, the Sun television rights are held by NBC Sports Boston. Select games air instead on sister station NECN.

Until 2023, Sun games aired on NESN. Previously, Connecticut Sun games also aired on WCTX (MyTV 9), a local television station for the state of Connecticut. It was the second time WCTX had aired Sun matches. They were also the original home of Sun matches prior to the 2010 season. More often than not, NBA TV picked up the feed from the local broadcast, which are shown nationally. Broadcasters for the Sun games on WCTX consisted of Bob Heussler and Rebecca Lobo, Jennifer Rizzotti or Kara Wolters. From 2012–2014 Sun games were broadcast on CPTV Sports (CPTV-S). For the 2011 season, Sun games were broadcast on Comcast Sports Net New England, with Mike Gorman as an announcer. In addition to Mike Gorman, broadcasters in the past have included Leah Secondo and Kara Wolters.

Audio broadcasts for all home games are done by Bob Heussler, which (excluding blackout games, in which case are available on ESPN3.com) are streamed to the WNBA League Pass game feeds on the league website. Furthermore, some Sun games are broadcast nationally on CBS (locally via WFSB), CBS Sports Network, Ion Television (locally via WHPX), ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC (locally via WTNH).

<doc id="232280" wikidata="Q12858303" url="?curid=232280" title="Freon">
<text>Freon ( ) is a registered trademark of the Chemours Company and generic descriptor for a number of halocarbon products. They are stable, nonflammable, low toxicity gases or liquids which have generally been used as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants. These include chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, both of which cause ozone depletion (although the latter much less so) and contribute to global warming. &#x27;Freon&#x27; is the brand name for the refrigerants R-12, R-13B1, R-22, R-410A, R-502, and R-503 manufactured by The Chemours Company, and so is not used to label all refrigerants of this type. They emit a strong smell similar to acetone. Freon has been found to cause damage to human health when inhaled in large amounts. Studies have been conducted in the pursuit to find beneficial reuses for gases under the Freon umbrella as an alternative to disposal of the gas.

==History==
The first CFCs were synthesized by Frédéric Swarts in the 1890s. In the late 1920s, a research team was formed by Charles Franklin Kettering in General Motors to find a replacement for the dangerous refrigerants then in use, such as ammonia. The team was headed by Thomas Midgley Jr. In 1928, they improved the synthesis of CFCs and demonstrated their usefulness for such a purpose and their stability and nontoxicity. Kettering patented a refrigerating apparatus to use the gas; this was issued to Frigidaire, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors.

In 1930, General Motors and DuPont formed Kinetic Chemicals to produce Freon. Their product was dichlorodifluoromethane and is now designated &quot;Freon-12&quot;, &quot;R-12&quot;, or &quot;CFC-12&quot;. The number after the R is a refrigerant class number developed by DuPont to systematically identify single halogenated hydrocarbons, as well as other refrigerants besides halocarbons.

Most uses of CFCs are now banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August 1987, as they have been shown to be responsible for ozone depletion. Brands of Freon containing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) instead have replaced many uses, but they, too, are under strict control under the Kyoto Protocol, as they are deemed &quot;super-greenhouse effect&quot; gases.

==Beneficial reuse==
It is possible to convert Freon-11 into three dimensional graphene through chemical treatment involving magnesium powder. Injecting CCl3F (Freon-11) into an argon filled container and across the surface of molten magnesium powder allows the chemicals to undergo a reduction reaction that creates three dimensional graphene. This three dimensional graphene is highly conductive and can be used to create high-rate supercapacitors for storage of electrical power. 

==Health effects==
Freon, when used as an inhalant has been found to have desired effects such as euphoria or intoxication. This has led to some individuals using Freon recreationally in order to achieve these effects. When inhaled, Freon has toxic effects that can have detrimental impacts on various systems in the body. These effects can damage the brain and the cardiovascular system, potentially causing abnormalities in heart functions as well as seizures. Freon inhalation can also cause damage to the lungs and in rare cases, respiratory failure. Injury of the lungs due to Freon inhalation is known as hydrocarbon pneumonitis. 

==See also==
* Chlorodifluoromethane (R-22 or HCFC-22), a type of Freon.
* Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or CFC-12), the most commonly used Freon brand refrigerant prior to its ban in many countries in 1996 and total ban in 2010.
* 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (R-134a or HFC-134a), one of the main replacements for the formerly widespread R-12.
* Opteon halogenated olefins now replacing Freons in many applications.

<text>Rayong province (, ) is one of seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) within Thailand, and lies in eastern Thailand. The province is bordered by Chonburi to its west and north; Chanthaburi to its east; and the Gulf of Thailand to its south.

, per capita earnings were higher in Rayong province than in any other Thai province.

==History==
Rayong began to appear in 1570 in the reign of Maha Thammaracha, The Khmer Ruler has invaded Siam in the eastern coastal city but unable to seize the city.

Following the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese during the Burmese–Siamese War, the future king of the Thonburi kingdom, Taksin, arrived in Rayong. In Rayong, Taksin built a new navy before going on to Chanthaburi to assemble forces to fight the Burmese. Taksin then passed back through Rayong during the reunification of Siam as the Thonburi kingdom. The oldest temple in Rayong, Wat Pa Pradu, is dedicated to Taksin where locals worship his spirit.

In 1906, Rayong was merged to Monthon Chanthaburi. In 1908, Klaeng district was merged to Rayong.

In the reign of King Rama VI, changed the name of &quot;Rayong City&quot; to &quot;Rayong province&quot; in 1916 but it still part of Monthon Chanthaburi. Later in 1931, Monthon Chanthaburi was dissolved and Rayong was merged to Monthon Prachinburi.

==Geography==

Although the north is hilly, the province consists mostly of low coastal plains. The total forest area is or 8 percent of provincial area. Off the shoreline of Mueang Rayong District is Khao Laem Ya–Mu Ko Samet National Park, consisting of several islands.
===National parks===
There are two national parks, along with five other national parks, make up region 2 (Si Racha) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Khao Laem Ya–Mu Ko Samet National Park, 
* Khao Chamao–Khao Wong National Park, 

==Symbols==
The seal of the province shows the island Ko Samet. The provincial tree is the Alexandrian laurel (&quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot;). &quot;Neolissochilus soroides&quot; is a provincial fish.

==Economy==
Rayong is one of the three Thai provinces, together with Chonburi and Chachoengsao, at the center of the nation&#x27;s Eastern Economic Corridor. The three provinces are to become Thailand&#x27;s hub for manufacturing, research, and services tightly coupled with its ASEAN neighbors and the world logistically. The project is the centerpiece of the government&#x27;s &quot;Thailand 4.0&quot; economic initiative.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into eight districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 58 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 388 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 21 November 2019 there are: one Rayong Provincial Administrative Organization - PAO (&quot;&quot;) and 30 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. The capital Rayong has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Ban Chang and Map Ta Phut have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and 27 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 37 Subdistrict Administrative Organizations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

== Health ==
Rayong&#x27;s main hospital is Rayong Hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

P. Sailaja and Chakri Toleti. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and became a box office hit. The film has received two National Film Awards, three Filmfare Awards South and the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film (Bronze).

The film was premiered at the 9th IFFI in 1984, and retrospectively at the 45th IFFI in the &quot;Celebrating Dance in Indian cinema&quot; section. The film was dubbed into Russian, and was screened at the Moscow International Film Festival, Asia Pacific Film Festival and AISFM Film Festival. &quot;Salangai Oli&quot; was released on the same day as &quot;Sagara Sangamam&quot;.

==Plot==
Balakrishna, fondly called Balu, is an economically disadvantaged but multi-talented dancer, adept at the Indian classical dances of Kuchipudi, Bharatanatyam, Kathak, etc. His simple and very honest soul does not permit him to attain professional success in the commercial world that requires a certain level of moral laxness. Madhavi, a wealthy young woman and a dance patron, notices his talent and acts as his benefactor, helping him secure an opportunity to participate in a high-level classical dance festival.

Balu&#x27;s aging mother passes away from the afflictions of poverty, two days before his performance. Balu, who was very attached to her, is emotionally devastated and fails to participate in the dance festival. Madhavi nevertheless, gives him support and encouragement and sets him on the mend. Balu gradually develops a fondness for Madhavi as their relationship grows. He hides his love for her but eventually picks up the courage to express it. Balu discovers that, while Madhavi shares his feelings, she is a married woman separated from her husband. Her husband later returns to unite Madhavi and Balu, but Balu decides to sacrifice his love, showing respect for the institution of marriage.

Years pass, and Balu, a disappointed man, has become an inconsolable alcoholic and a newspaper journalist/art critic. Once he critiques a dancer, Sailaja, for a lack of concentration on her form and more towards the audience, which results in them having a fight. The article is in-turn read by Madhavi, who turns out to be Sailaja&#x27;s mother, and has lost her husband. She finds out about Balu, his medical condition, never ending love for her, and her family. In a bid to revive his will to live and his passion for his art, she tends to his medical needs through his friend, Raghu, and solicits Balu to be the dance instructor for her daughter. She does not come in front of him, worried that he would not be able to cope with the news of her being a widow. However, a situation arises where she saves him from falling into a well. She comes in front of him wearing a bhindi. He later learns the truth about her husband and his condition deteriorates.

The film ends with Sailaja&#x27;s on-stage performance with Balu watching her in a wheelchair, his health completely deteriorated. He dies while watching her performance. A heartbroken Raghu takes him away quietly, without interrupting the performance. Madhavi, devastated, follows them with an umbrella, covering Balu from the rain.

==Cast==
==Production==
Kamal and R. C. Sakthi wanted to make a film on a subject, about a dancer who was an alcoholic, which they named &quot;Anupallavi&quot; when K. Viswanath approached him with a similar subject, Kamal felt he had to do the film. On the sets of the film, Gopi Krishna, one of the choreographers, insisted that Kamal should train for at least a month. Kamal was one of the top stars of the time, doing multiple shifts, and had to find the time. Kamal said it was the &quot;greatest sacrifice from my side&quot;. Playback singer S. P. Sailaja was recruited to play a prominent role, thereby making her debut as an actress and it also remains the only film she had acted in so far. K. Viswanath who is related to Sailaja, decided that she would fit perfectly in the role of Kamal Haasan&#x27;s pupil, after seeing the photos. Sailaja recalled: &quot;I was reluctant as I was trained only in Bharatanatyam, but in the film I had to perform other dance forms like Kathak too. While shooting my introductory song &quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot; at Ravindra Bharathi, I became nervous on the stage and refused to act&quot;. Chakri Toleti did the role of a photographer boy in the film. Thota Tharani said that the budget was drastically cut for the song in which Kamal dances on the well.

==Soundtrack==
The film score and soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja . The lyrics for the Telugu version were written by Veturi, while Vairamuthu has written the lyrics for the Tamil version and Sreekumaran Thampi for Malayalam version.

<doc id="232298" wikidata="Q646725" url="?curid=232298" title="Dénia">
<text>Dénia (; ) is a historical coastal city in the province of Alicante, Spain, on the Costa Blanca halfway between Alicante and Valencia, and the capital and judicial seat of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Marina Alta. Denia&#x27;s historical heritage has been influenced by Iberian, Greek, Roman, Islamic, Napoleonic and Christian civilizations. , it had a population of 49,700, although this is more than doubled by tourism during the summer months.

==History==
There is evidence of human habitation in the area since prehistoric times and there are significant Iberian ruins on the hillsides nearby. In the 4th century BC it was a Greek colony of Marseille or Empúries, perhaps the one mentioned by Strabo as &quot;Hēmeroskopeion&quot; () (meaning &quot;watchtower&quot;). It was an ally of Rome during the Punic Wars, and later was absorbed into the Roman Empire under the name of &quot;Dianium&quot; (after their goddess Diana). In the 1st century BC Quintus Sertorius established a Roman naval base here.

From 636696, under Visigothic rule, it was the seat of a bishop subordinate to Toledo. After the Muslim conquest of Iberia and the dissolution of the Caliphate of Córdoba, Dénia (, ) became the capital of a Taifa kingdom that reigned over part of the Valencian coast and Ibiza. Slavic Muslim slaves, &quot;saqālibah&quot;, led by Mujahid ibn Yusuf ibn Ali, profited from the progressive crumbling of the Caliphate&#x27;s superstructure to gain control over the province of Dénia. The &quot;saqālibah&quot; managed to free themselves and run the kingdom, which extended its reach as far as the islands of Majorca and its capital . The &quot;saqālibah&quot; taifa lost its independence in 1076, when it was captured by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, lord of Zaragoza, under which it remained until the Almoravid invasion in 1091. The Muslim Arabs originally built the castle fortress, and the French, who occupied the city for four years during the Peninsular War, rebuilt it in the early 19th century.
The town was reconquered by the Christians in 1244. This caused a decline for the city, which remained nearly uninhabited after the exile of most of the Muslim population. It was later repopulated by the Valencian government. Created a fief in 1298, it was held by the de Sandoval family from 1431, although the city itself was returned to the Aragonese crown in 1455. A marquisate from 1487, Dénia gained many privileges thanks to Francisco Gómez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma, a favourite of Philip III of Spain. It suffered a further period of decay after the decree of Expulsion of the Moriscos (1609), by which 25,000 people left the marquisate, leaving the local economy in a dismal state.

During the War of the Spanish Succession Dénia was besieged by 9,000 French troops in June 1707, who broke down several sections of the town walls using cannon, but their attacks in July were repulsed by the small garrison with great loss of life to the attackers resulting in the siege being raised after 27 days. Dénia, however, fell to the French forces that November. In 1713 the Treaty of Utrecht recognised Louis XIV&#x27;s grandson Philip, Duke of Anjou, as King of Spain (as Philip V), so returning Dénia to Spanish rule.

It was reacquired by the Spanish crown in 1803, after which Denia gained an increasingly important role as a trading port. A community of English raisin traders lived in Denia from 1800 until the time of the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s.

==Main sights==
Dénia is home to a large Moorish castle named Castle of Dénia on a rocky crag overlooking the city. It was built in the 11th and 12th century and offers views around the sea, the city and the surrounding area. Located in the castle is the Palau del Governador and its corresponding museum.

Dénia also has the &quot;Museu Etnològic&quot; with further details on the history and culture of the city.

* Route of the Valencian classics

==Climate==
Dénia has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;), with mild winters and hot summers. The average annual temperature surpasses and the rainfall amount is around . The mean temperature of the coldest month (January) is around , while the mean of the hottest month (August) is around . Autumn is by far the wettest season, receiving more than of rainfall, mostly falling in few days but with heavy rainfalls, a phenomenon called cold drop in Spain that is very common on the Valencian coast. Both September and October receive more than of rainfall while November receives close to 100mm as well. Summer is the driest season, but not rainless, as on average, it receives around although July is almost rainless as on average it receives under of rain, being the sunniest month as well. Storms are common in Autumn, averaging about 15 stormy days per year. The city enjoys around 2750 sunshine hours per year.

==Transportation==

The ferry to Ibiza and the other Balearic Islands departs daily. The city also serves as the northern terminus for a railway line through the mountains from Alicante (popularly known as the Limón Express), run by FGV. This is not a specific tourist railway; it provides transport throughout the year and is geared to commuter use.

==Culture==

The bonfire festival is celebrated each March. Huge papier-mâché statues called &quot;fallas&quot; are set up throughout the town, and then set ablaze.

The &quot;Bous a la Mar&quot; (meaning &quot;Bulls at the Sea&quot;) is held in July. The highlight of this week-long festival is watching bulls run down the main street &quot;Marqués de Campo&quot;, only to be chased into the Mediterranean sea by those daring enough to enter a makeshift bull ring with them.

Since 1974 it has been home to painter and sculptor Joan Castejón. The town honored him as an Adoptive Son of Dénia in 1999.

<doc id="232299" wikidata="Q868160" url="?curid=232299" title="Society of Saint Pius X">
<text>The Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX; , FSSPX) is a canonically irregular traditionalist Catholic priestly fraternity founded in 1970 by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. Lefebvre was a leading traditionalist at the Second Vatican Council with the and Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers until 1968. The society was established as a pious union of the Catholic Church with the permission of François Charrière, the Bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg in Switzerland.

The society is named after Pope Pius X, whose anti-Modernist stance it stresses, retaining the Tridentine Mass and pre-Vatican II liturgical books in Latin for the other sacraments. The society&#x27;s current Superior General is the Reverend Davide Pagliarani, who succeeded Bishop Bernard Fellay in 2018. Several organisations derive from the SSPX such as the mostly American and effectively sedevacantist Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV) and the canonically regular Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP), that Pope John Paul II made into a society of apostolic life in 1988.

Tensions between the society and the Holy See climaxed in 1988 with the Écône consecrations: Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated four bishops without the Apostolic Mandate and against a personal warning by Pope John Paul II, resulting in Rome declaring that the bishops who consecrated or were consecrated had incurred (automatic) excommunication. Though the SSPX denied that the bishops incurred any penalty, who, citing canon law, argued that the consecrations were permissible due to a moral and theological crisis in the Catholic Church, making them permissible under canon law, the declared excommunication of the surviving bishops was at their request removed in 2009 in the hope of speedily reaching &quot;full reconciliation and complete communion&quot;.

The society&#x27;s canonical situation remains unresolved. The 2010s saw growing recognition by the Holy See of its sacramental and pastoral activities, with papal recognition extended indefinitely in 2017 to confessions heard by its priests, and local ordinaries allowed to grant delegation to its priests for officially witnessing marriages. In addition, the Holy See named SSPX bishop Fellay as judge in a canonical trial against one of the society&#x27;s priests. The significance of these recognitions is that, unlike other Catholic sacraments, both confession and marriage require canonical jurisdiction for their validity. While its critics claim the society&#x27;s priests were not explicitly granted the requisite jurisdiction, it contends that they possessed &quot;supplied jurisdiction&quot; for confessions due to a &quot;state of necessity&quot;.

In 2022, the society states it has over 700 priestly members, with 1,135 total members. Several religious institutes, mostly based in France, are associated with the society.

Worldwide, there are an estimated 600,000 people who attend SSPX Mass centres.

==History==

Like Traditionalist Catholicism in general, the SSPX was born out of opposition to changes in the Catholic Church that followed the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). The founder and central figure of the society was the French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had served the Catholic Church as Apostolic Delegate for French-speaking Africa, Archbishop of Dakar, and Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, a missionary order of priests.

=== Foundation of the society ===
In September 1970, shortly after his retirement as Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, Lefebvre was approached by eleven members of the Pontifical French Seminary in Rome. They sought Lefebvre&#x27;s advice on a conservative seminary where they could complete their studies. He directed them to the University of Fribourg, in Switzerland.

In late 1970, at age 65, urged by the abbot of Hauterive Abbey and the Dominican theologian Father Marie-Dominique Philippe to teach the seminarians personally, Lefebvre, feeling too old to undertake such a large project, told them he would visit François Charrière, Bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg, with a request to set up a religious society. He told them, if he said to go through with it, he would see in it a sign of Divine Providence. Charrière granted Lefebvre&#x27;s request and, with a document predated by six days to 1 November 1970, he established the Society of St. Pius X as a (Latin, for &quot;pious, or holy, union&quot;) on a provisional () basis for six years. status was the first stage through which a Catholic organisation passed prior to gaining official recognition as a religious institute or society of apostolic life. (Since 1983, the term &quot;Association of the Christian faithful&quot; has replaced .) The Society of Saint Pius X was formally founded, adhering to all canonical norms, and receiving the episcopal blessing and encouragement of the local ordinary. Some Swiss laymen offered the International Seminary of Saint Pius X at Écône to the newly formed group, and in 1971 the first 24 candidates entered, followed by a further 32 in October 1972.

Normally, after a suitable period of experience and consultation with the Holy See, a bishop would raise a to official status at the diocesan level. Lefebvre attempted to bypass this stage and contacted three different Holy See departments to secure early recognition for his society. He successfully obtained a letter of encouragement from Cardinal John Wright, prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, but there was no approval from the Holy See congregation responsible for raising an association to the level desired by Lefebvre. Cardinal Wright&#x27;s letter, dated 18 February 1971, said concerning the field of competence of Cardinal Wright&#x27;s own Congregation, that the association &quot;will be able to contribute much to accomplishing the plan drawn up by this Congregation for worldwide sharing of clergy.&quot; Cardinal Wright was still recommending prospective seminarians to apply to Écône as late as 1973.

The establishment of the SSPX was unwelcome to some churchmen, most notably the French bishops, whose theological outlook differed from Lefebvre&#x27;s, and who had important connections with the Holy See Cardinal Secretary of State, Jean-Marie Villot. According to one defender of Lefebvre, at the meeting of the French episcopal conference at Lourdes in 1972 the seminary at Écône was nicknamed —the &quot;wildcat seminary&quot;. By November 1974 the French episcopate indicated that they would not incardinate any of Lefebvre&#x27;s priests in their dioceses which was the opposite of the desire to incardinate the society&#x27;s priests by some Swiss bishops. They also publicly criticised Catholics who remained attached to the Tridentine Mass. By this time, the SSPX had opened additional seminaries in Armada, Michigan (1973), and Rome (1974).
=== Canonical visitation of seminary ===
The first sign of curial intervention was a Vatican meeting on 26 March 1974. By June 1974, a commission of cardinals had been formed to inquire into the SSPX, and decided on a canonical visitation of the seminary by two Belgian priests, held 11–13 November 1974. Franz Schmidberger, later the society&#x27;s superior general during 1983–1994, said that their report was favourable. However, the seminarians and staff at Écône were shocked by some liberal theological opinions expressed by the two priests. In what he later described as a mood of &quot;doubtlessly excessive indignation&quot;, Lefebvre wrote a declaration denouncing what he considered liberal trends &quot;clearly evident&quot; in the council and in the subsequent reforms. This document was leaked and published in January 1975, in the French Traditionalist Catholic journal &quot;Itinéraires&quot;.

Lefebvre was in serious difficulties. In January 1975, Bishop Pierre Mamie of Fribourg wrote to Rome stating his intention to withdraw the status that his predecessor had granted. In the same month, Lefebvre was summoned to the Vatican, meeting with the cardinals on 13 February and 3 March. Lefebvre was surprised by their hostility: at one point a French cardinal, Gabriel-Marie Garrone, reportedly called him a &quot;fool&quot;.

=== Growing tensions ===
On 6 May 1975, with the cardinals&#x27; approval, Bishop Mamie withdrew the SSPX&#x27;s status. Lefebvre instructed his lawyer to lodge appeals, and he ultimately petitioned the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, which turned down the appeal. From this point onward, the SSPX was no longer recognised as a canonical organization.

Lefebvre and the society&#x27;s leadership always maintained that he was treated unfairly by the Roman Curia, that the suppression of the SSPX was unjust, and that the procedures violated the 1917 Code of Canon Law.

The SSPX continued to operate in spite of its discountenance. In the consistory of 24 May 1976, Pope Paul VI rebuked Archbishop Lefebvre by name—reportedly the first time in 200 years that a pope had publicly reprimanded a Catholic bishop—and appealed to him and his followers to change their minds.

Lefebvre announced that he intended to confer ordination on some of his students at the end of June 1976. On 12 June 1976, the Nuncio in Switzerland was given instructions to inform Lefebvre that, by special order of Pope Paul VI, he was forbidden to do so. On 25 June 1976, Archbishop Giovanni Benelli, the deputy Secretary of State, wrote directly to Lefebvre, confirming, by the Pope&#x27;s special mandate, the prohibition to administer the holy orders, and warning him of the canonical penalties for Lefebvre himself and those whom he would ordain. Lefebvre ignored the warnings and went ahead with the ordinations on 29 June 1976.

In that occasion&#x27;s sermon, Lefebvre explicitly recognized that he might be struck with suspension, and the new priests with an irregularity that could theoretically prevent them from saying Mass. The next day, 1 July 1976, the Press Office of the Holy See declared that following canon 2373 of the then Code of Canon Law, Lefebvre was automatically suspended for one year from conferring ordination and that those whom he had ordained were automatically suspended from exercising the order received. It was also announced that the Holy See was examining Lefebvre&#x27;s disobedience to the Pope&#x27;s orders.

On 11 July 1976, Lefebvre signed a certificate of receipt of a letter from Cardinal Sebastiano Baggio, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, intimating that further penalties would be imposed per canon 2331 §1 of the then Code of Canon Law concerning obstinate disobedience to legitimate precepts or prohibitions of the Roman Pontiff. He was enjoined, within ten days of receipt of the letter, to take steps &quot;to repair the scandal caused.&quot; In a letter of 17 July to Pope Paul VI, Lefebvre declared that he judged his action of 29 June to be legitimate. The Pope considered this response inadequate, and on his instructions, the Congregation for Bishops, on 22 July 1976, suspended Lefebvre for an indefinite time from all exercise of holy orders—he could not confer any of the Sacraments, save Reconciliation or Baptism in an emergency (suspension ).

===Écône consecrations (1988)===

A central controversy surrounding the SSPX concerns the consecration by Archbishop Lefebvre and Brazilian bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer of four SSPX priests as bishops in 1988, in violation of the orders of Pope John Paul II.

By 1987, Archbishop Lefebvre was 81. If he had died at that point, the SSPX could have their members ordained to the priesthood only at the hands of non-SSPX bishops, regarded by Lefebvre as unreliable and unorthodox. In June 1987, Lefebvre announced his intention to consecrate a successor to the episcopacy. He implied that he intended to do this with or without the approval of the Holy See. In the Catholic Church, a bishop requires the mandate of the Pope if he is to consecrate a bishop, and an unauthorized consecration automatically incurs excommunication. Earlier, Pope Pius XII, in his encyclical , had described the sacramental activity of bishops who had been consecrated without papal approval as &quot;gravely illicit, that is, criminal and sacrilegious&quot;. The Roman authorities were grieved by Lefebvre&#x27;s plan, but they began discussions with him and the SSPX, which led to the signing, on 5 May 1988, of a skeleton agreement between Lefebvre and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the future Pope Benedict XVI.

On Pope John Paul II&#x27;s instructions, Cardinal Ratzinger replied to Lefebvre on 30 May, insisting on the observance of the 5 May agreement and adding that, if Lefebvre carried out unauthorized consecrations on 30 June, the promised authorization for the ordination to the episcopacy would be withdrawn.

On 3 June, Lefebvre wrote that he intended to proceed. On 9 June, the Pope replied with a personal letter, appealing to him to abandon a design that &quot;would be seen as nothing other than a schismatic act, the theological and canonical consequences of which are known to you.&quot; Lefebvre did not reply, and the letter was made public on 16 June.

On 30 June 1988, Archbishop Lefebvre proceeded to ordain to the episcopate four priests of the SSPX. Antônio de Castro Mayer, the retired Bishop of Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil, assisted in the ceremony. Those consecrated as Bishops were: Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Alfonso de Galarreta, and Richard Williamson.

The following day, the Congregation for Bishops issued a decree declaring that Archbishop Lefebvre and the four newly ordained bishops had incurred the automatic canonical penalty of excommunication reserved to the Holy See. On the following day, 2 July, Pope John Paul II issued an apostolic letter known as in which he condemned the Archbishop&#x27;s action. The Pope stated that, since schism is defined in the 1983 Code of Canon Law as &quot;withdrawal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or from communion with the members of the Church subject to him&quot; (canon 751), the consecration &quot;constitute[d] a schismatic act&quot;, and that, by virtue of canon 1382 of the Code, it entailed ipso facto excommunication for all the bishops involved.

Lefebvre argued that his actions had been necessary because the traditional form of the Catholic faith and sacraments would become extinct without Traditionalist clergy to pass them on to the next generation. He called the ordinations (&quot;Operation Survival&quot;), citing in his defense canons 1323 and 1324 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, the first of which says that &quot;a person who acted coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience unless the act is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls&quot; is not subject to penalty for violating a law or precept, while the other says &quot;the perpetrator of a violation is not exempt from a penalty, but the penalty established by law or precept must be tempered or a penance employed in its place if the delict was committed [...] by a person who thought in culpable error that one of the circumstances mentioned in can. 1323, nn. 4 or 5 was present.&quot;
Some members of the SSPX disassociated themselves from the society as a result of Lefebvre&#x27;s actions and, with the approval of the Holy See, formed a separate society called the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter.

Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer resigned as Bishop of Campos on 20 August 1981; he later participated in the 1988 Écône consecrations, declaring &quot;my presence here at this ceremony is a matter of conscience: It is the duty of a profession of the Catholic Faith before the entire Church.&quot; After his retirement, Bishop Mayer founded the Priestly Union of Saint John Mary Vianney (SSJV). Under the leadership of his successor, Bishop Licínio Rangel, the SSJV was reconstituted in January 2002 by Pope John Paul II as the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney, with the same territory as the Diocese of Campos.

===Discussions with the Holy See===

Discussions between the Holy See and the Society of Saint Pius X towards an eventual reconciliation have been ongoing. For years after the 1988 consecrations, there was little if any dialogue between the SSPX and the Holy See. This state of affairs ended when the society led a large pilgrimage to Rome for the &quot;Great Jubilee&quot; of 2000.

Nine years later, on 21 January 2009, the Holy See remitted the excommunications of the society&#x27;s bishops that it had declared at the time of the 1988 consecrations and expressed the hope that all members of the society would follow this up by speedily returning to full communion with the Church.

Discussions since then have been complex, stemming from the society&#x27;s insistence that the teachings of the Second Vatican Council on ecumenism, religious liberty, and collegiality are inconsistent with Catholic teaching and doctrine, a claim that the Holy See views as unacceptable, but recent discussions have indicated the possibility of an understanding. In an interview on 4 March 2017 with DICI, the official news organ of the society, Bishop Bernard Fellay stated:Whether it is a question of religious liberty, collegiality, ecumenism, the new Mass, or even the new rites of the sacraments [...] And now all of a sudden, on these points that have been stumbling blocks, the emissaries from Rome tell us that they are open questions.In the same month of March 2017, Archbishop Guido Pozzo, the prelate in charge of the Pontifical Commission &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot;, the Roman Curia&#x27;s organ for traditionalist societies, stated that the Holy See and the society were close to an agreement regularizing the society&#x27;s status. In a letter of the same month it was announced that Pope Francis authorized diocesan bishops to grant to SSPX priests faculties to officiate at a marriage valid in the Catholic Church in cases where no priest in good standing could do so.

In July 2017 Bishop Fellay signed a document along with a number of other clergy and academics labelled as a &quot;Filial Correction&quot; of Pope Francis. In twenty-five-page document, which was made public in September after receiving no reply from the Holy See, they criticized the Pope for allegedly promoting heresy through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate.

=== Expulsion of Bishop Williamson ===
In August 2012, Bishop Richard Williamson, one of those illicitely consecrated by Lefebvre, administered the sacrament of confirmation to about 100 laypeople at the Benedictine Monastery of the Holy Cross in Nova Friburgo, Brazil, during an unauthorised visit to the State of Rio de Janeiro. The society&#x27;s South American district superior, interlanguage Christian Bouchacourt, protested against his action on the SSPX website, saying that it was &quot;a serious act against the virtue of obedience.&quot; In early October 2012, the leadership of the SSPX gave Williamson a deadline to declare his submission, instead of which he published an &quot;open letter&quot; asking for the resignation of the Superior General. On 4 October 2012, the Society expelled Williamson in a &quot;painful decision&quot; citing the failures &quot;to show respect and obedience deserved by his legitimate superiors&quot;.

=== Bishop Vitus Huonder ===

In May 2019, the SSPX announced that Vitus Huonder, Bishop emeritus of Chur, Switzerland, as per a long-stated intention, had retired to one of the society&#x27;s houses in order &quot;to dedicate himself to prayer and silence, to celebrate the traditional Mass exclusively, and to work for Tradition, the only way of renewing the Church.&quot; In 2015, Bishop Huonder was sent by the former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and one of Pope Francis&#x27; top advisers in the Vatican, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller to dialogue with the SSPX. After four years Bishop Huonder was permitted to go and live at the society&#x27;s houses by Pope Francis. He became a big supporter of the society, reporting back positive things to Pope Francis and even producing a video titled &quot;My journey to the SSPX – with Bishop Vitus Huonder&quot; on Youtube. In that video, Bishop Vitus Huonder said that Pope Francis personally told him that the SSPX is not in schism. He was warmly received by the SSPX:&quot;The Society of Saint Pius X appreciates Bishop Huonder’s courageous decision and rejoices to be able to provide him with the spiritual and priestly surroundings that he desires so deeply. May this example be followed by others, so as to &#x27;restore everything in Christ&#x27;.&quot;Bishop Huonder died on 3 April 2024 at the age of 81, following serious illness. His funeral Mass on 17 April was celebrated by Bishop Fellay, and Huonder was buried at the International Seminary of Saint Pius X in Écône next to the tomb of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. Huonder&#x27;s successor, Bishop Joseph Maria Bonnemain, attended the funeral, but did not take part in the celebration, due to the irregular canonical situation of the SSPX. 

=== Death of Bishop Tissier de Mallerais ===
Bishop Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, another of the Bishops illicitely consecrated by Lefebvre, suffered a tragic accident on 28 September 2024, when he fell on the stairs of the Ecône seminary, causing a skull fracture and an internal haemorrhaging; he was promptly brought to the Hospital at Martigny and placed into an induced coma. He died on 8 October 2024, after 10 days of coma; his funeral was held at the International Seminary of Saint Pius X, on 18 October. 

The deaths of Bishops Huonder and Tissier de Mallerais, coupled with the expulsion of Bishop Williamson, means that Bernard Fellay and Alfonso de Galarreta are the only remaining Bishops affiliated to the SSPX, prompting Catholic media to speculate whether the Society will proceed to new consecrations.

==Canonical situation==

The canonical situation of the SSPX and of its clergy has been the subject of controversy since the 1988 Écône consecrations. While the society is not listed in as a recognized society of apostolic life, it has nonetheless benefited from some significant allowances normally granted only to recognized orders and societies.

=== Marriage ===
On 27 March 2017, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith communicated that Pope Francis granted local ordinaries the right to give to a priest in good standing the faculty to preside at the marriage of the society&#x27;s followers, immediately after which they will participate in a Mass celebrated by an SSPX priest, or, if no priest in good standing can receive the couple&#x27;s consent, to give the faculty instead to an SSPX priest.

The Catholic priest, Father John Zuhlsdorf opined that suspended priests cannot receive faculties:If the SSPX priests can receive faculties, and they have, all over the place, then they are not suspended.

=== Confession ===
On 20 November 2016, Pope Francis personally and indefinitely extended an allowance he created during the Holy Year of 2015 for penitents confessing to priests affiliated with the SSPX:For the Jubilee Year I had also granted that those faithful who, for various reasons, attend churches officiated by the priests of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Pius X, can validly and licitly receive the sacramental absolution of their sins.

=== Ordination and Holy Orders ===
During an interview with &quot;TV Libertés&quot; on 29 January 2017, Bishop Fellay announced that theological discussions with the Holy See had led to permission for the society to licitly ordain priests:This summer it was confirmed that the Superior General can freely ordain the priests of the society without having to ask permission from the local bishop.

=== Catholic Mass ===
In 2022, Bishop Athanasius Schneider said that the SSPX was not schismatic as it prays for the Pope during Mass. Bishop Schneider states clearly that Catholics can attend the chapels of the SSPX. 

=== Jurisdiction ===
When told by a journalist of InfoVaticana that what Pope Francis had decided in March 2017 was instead that, &quot;from now on, the weddings celebrated by the priests from the FSSPX are going to be recognized&quot;, Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who had not seen the actual document, remarked:That is a very significant action of the Holy Father, and it also indicates that in some way there must be a reconciliation of the SSPX because basically what the Pope is saying is that the priests in this society, when they witness marriages, are exercising jurisdiction in the Roman Catholic Church.In reality, it is local ordinaries, not the society, that in the document are authorized, if they wish, to delegate jurisdiction to SSPX priests to assist canonically at some marriages.

The society&#x27;s view is that, before Pope Francis&#x27;s authorizations, their priests held &quot;supplied&quot; jurisdiction (power of governance) for confessions and marriages. They received this supplied jurisdiction by law and not &quot;by delegation or by mandate of the Sovereign Pontiff or the diocesan bishops or of regularly appointed parish priests.&quot;

Since the grants by Pope Francis, the society says that its priests have or can have ordinary jurisdiction for the sacraments of confession and marriage. It adds that, in cases where a diocesan bishop refuses to grant delegation for a marriage, SSPX priests can still use extraordinary jurisdiction.

==SSPX today==

, the society had 3 bishops and 676 priests residing in 36 countries, 760 Mass centers, 159 priories, 135 religious brothers, 82 sister oblates, 190 seminarians in six seminaries, 63 pre-seminarians in three pre-seminaries. Edizioni Piane is the FSSPX&#x27;s official publishing house in its Italian district.

The society is divided into two classes of territorial units called districts and autonomous houses, each headed by a superior. An autonomous house may become a district after three priories have been established within its jurisdiction. The most recent organizational addition of the society is the Autonomous House of Central America and the Caribbean, formed from territory taken from the District of Mexico, erected on 1 October 2017. Over 120 (&gt;20%) of the society&#x27;s priests are stationed in the District of France.

The society managed to triple the number of its chapels in Poland from 2019 to 2021.

The first seminary founded by the society is the St. Pius X International Seminary located in Écône, Switzerland. Its largest is located in the United States: St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary, Dillwyn, Virginia, and having outgrown its previous facilities, relocated in 2016 from Winona, Minnesota; the former seminary complex continues to house the novitiate of the religious brothers. Other seminaries are located in France ( Seminary, Flavigny-sur-Ozerain), Germany (Sacred Heart of Jesus Seminary, Zaitzkofen), and Argentina (, La Reja). The society also runs pre-seminaries for prospective priestly vocations in Italy (Albano Laziale), Brazil (Santa Maria), and the Philippines (Santa Barbara, Iloilo).

===Notable groups that have split from the SSPX===

There have been two major kinds of splits from the SSPX. Two notable splits of the first kind involved priests who viewed the SSPX as too liberal and who use the form that the Mass had before Pope John XXIII. The other kind involved groups who have reconciled with the Holy See and who, like the SSPX, use the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal.

Groups which broke with the SSPX which are not recognized by the Holy See include:
* Society of Saint Pius VIn 1983, nine U.S. SSPX priests broke with or were forced to leave the SSPX&#x27;s Northeast USA District partly because they were opposed to Lefebvre&#x27;s instructions that Mass be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal issued by Pope John XXIII. Those in SSPX circles refer to these priests as &quot;the nine&quot;. They began their organization by refusing to complete a transaction of a church that the SSPX was attempting to purchase, using one of the nine priests as the buyer. The founding priests took the money intended for the purchase of the church and kept the church for themselves. A number of the SSPV&#x27;s priests and the lay people who go to their Masses are openly sedevacantist, a position rejected by the SSPX. Issues occasioning the split were: Lefebvre&#x27;s order that Society priests must accept the decrees of nullity handed down by diocesan marriage tribunals; the insistence that all Society Masses be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal; the acceptance of new members into the group who had been ordained to the priesthood according to the revised sacramental rites of Pope Paul VI.
* Istituto Mater Boni Consilii – (English: &quot;Institute of the Mother of Good Counsel&quot;) is a traditionalist congregation of priests that follows the sedeprivationist school of thought. The founders of the institute seceded in 1985 from the Society of St. Pius X under the leadership of Fr. Francesco Ricossa, a one-time faculty member of the Écône seminary. In contrast to the North American-based SSPV, this Institute is based in Europe.
* Company of Jesus and Mary (CJM)In 1989, several priests and seminarians in La Reja, Argentina quit the Society of St. Pius X led by their former rector Fr. Andrés Morello. Some have adopted sedevacantist beliefs and submitted under bishops such as Moisés Carmona and eventually the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI) or the Sociedad Sacerdotal Trento (SST) while Morello and his followers who founded the religious congregation CJM adopted the Cassiciacum thesis. The CJM and some sedevacantists are based in Argentina while other sedevacantists are based mostly in Mexico but also in other countries in Central and South America.
* Priestly Union Marcel Lefebvre is a traditionalist Catholic apostolic association, founded on 15 July 2014 by Bishop Richard Williamson after his expulsion from the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Pius X.

Groups which broke with the SSPX which reconciled with Rome include:
* Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP)It was established in 1988 after the Écône consecrations. Responding to the Holy See&#x27;s declaration that these constituted a schismatic act and that those involved were thereby automatically excommunicated, twelve priests left the SSPX and established the FSSP, in full communion with the Holy See.
* Institute of the Good Shepherd(, IBP) was established as a papally-recognized society of apostolic life on 8 September 2006 for a group of SSPX members who maintained it was time for the society to accept reconciliation with Pope Benedict XVI.
* Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer (, FSSR) founded as a religious community affiliated with the SSPX in 1988. In 2008 the community petitioned to be reconciled with the Holy See, which was accepted by then Pope Benedict XVI.

===Supporters===
* Antônio de Castro Mayer (1904-1991), Brazilian bishop
* François Ducaud-Bourget (1897-1984), French priest and Anti-Nazi Resistant
* Gebhard Heyder (1904-1994), German Carmelite priest and Anti-Nazi Resistant
* Rose Hu (1933-2012), former internee in a Chinese prison camp
* Vitus Huonder (1942-2024), Swiss Bishop and Bible scholar
* Victoria Villarruel (born 1975), Argentine politician

===Lifestyle and clothing amongst adherents===
In the Society of Saint Pius X, a complementarian position for gender roles is upheld; &quot;In St. Mary&#x27;s, few married women work, especially once they have children.&quot;

Richard Williamson, a former bishop of the SSPX who now aligns with the SSPX Resistance, wrote a pastoral letter, in which he stated that &quot;women&#x27;s trousers, as worn today, short or long, modest or immodest, tight or loose, open or disguised (like the &#x27;culottes&#x27;), are an assault upon woman&#x27;s womanhood and so they represent a deep-lying revolt against the order willed by God.&quot; &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, in covering SSPX, described their female adherents as being &quot;Women in long, modest skirts [who were loading] vans that had enough seats to accommodate eight or nine kids.&quot;

During Catholic Mass, though there is no strict dress code, the SSPX advises “Sunday best&quot; attire. Women are recommended to wear skirts that fall at least below the knee, and no tight-fitting clothing. It is customary for women to wear a veil during prayer and worship. Men are encouraged to wear suits and ties.

==Controversies==
=== Political ===

After Bishop Richard Williamson, the subject of the complaint by the Anti-Defamation League, denied the use of Nazi gas chambers to massacre Jews in a 2009 interview, the superior-general of the society said that if he repeated his denial, he would be expelled. His actual expulsion in 2012 was for refusing to show due respect and obedience to the SSPX authorities and calling on the superior-general to resign. A German court convicted Williamson of Holocaust denial.

French Nazi collaborator and war criminal Paul Touvier was arrested in an SSPX priory. The priory&#x27;s superiors claimed that they had granted him asylum as &quot;an act of charity to a homeless man&quot;. They claimed no knowledge about the man&#x27;s background when he first appeared in the priory. On his death, in 1996, an SSPX Requiem Mass was offered for his soul, upon his request.

On 16 October 2013, the society offered to perform a funeral for Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke. Priebke, a baptized Protestant, converted post-war with his wife to a form of Catholicism and had his children baptized. He rejected the cult of race as a &quot;mistake that led down a path of no return.&quot; The ceremony did not take place due to protests by some 500 people outside the society&#x27;s Italian district house in Albano, near Rome. The local authorities of the Catholic Church refused him a public funeral, citing a rule of canon law that, unless they gave some signs of repentance before death, a public funeral must be refused to manifest sinners to whom it cannot be granted without public scandal of the faithful.

Despite controversies surrounding Nazism, the society mentioned that Archbishop Lefebvre&#x27;s father, René Lefebvre, met his death in the concentration camp at Sonnenburg in February 1944, three years after his arrest by the Gestapo; he died, &quot;his rosary in hand, a victim of Nazi insanity.&quot;

The society is also known for supporting the far-right, nationalist, ultra-conservative political party Civitas in France. 

=== Sexual abuse allegations ===
On 5 April 2017, Uppdrag granskning, a Swedish television program focused on investigative journalism, alleged that four members of the SSPX—three priests and a former seminarian—had molested at least a dozen young people in several countries. The program also stated that evidence of abuse was kept secret by the SSPX and that the priests were allowed to continue in ministry.

Kevin Gerard Sloniker, the former seminarian and the only person accused by name in the program, was expelled from the society&#x27;s St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in 2005 and began serving a life sentence in 2015. The remaining three accusations regard priests whose names have been withheld (referred to in the program as Fathers P, S, and M); their accusers have likewise remained anonymous. Nonetheless, P was the subject of a canonical trial presided over by Bishop Fellay, authorized by the Holy See in 2013; he was found guilty, and subsequently ordered to retire to a monastery. &quot;Crux&quot; reports &quot;P refused to go and, according to officials of the SSPX, joined [Bishop] Williamson&#x27;s Resistance.&quot;

In May 2020, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation stated that, as part of its investigation into the four Catholic dioceses in the state, it was also investigating accusations that SSPX members were either perpetrating or covering up clerical sex abuse in the state. The SSPX St. Mary&#x27;s Rectory in Kansas faced sex abuse allegations, although both the U.S. district of the society and the St. Mary&#x27;s Rectory denied the allegations.

<text>Swathi Muthyam () is a 1986 Indian Telugu-language romantic drama film written and directed by K. Viswanath and produced by Edida Nageswara Rao. The film stars Kamal Haasan and Radhika, while Gollapudi Maruti Rao, J. V. Somayajulu, Nirmalamma, Sarath Babu, and Y. Vijaya play supporting roles. The soundtrack and background score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. &quot;Swathi Muthyam&quot; depicts the plight of a young widow who is rescued by an autistic man.

&quot;Swathi Muthyam&quot; was a box office success and attained cult status. The film was screened at the Moscow Film Festival, the Asian and African film festival in Tashkent, the 11th IFFI in the inaugural mainstream section. The film received the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, three Nandi Awards and the Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu. The film was selected by India as its entry for the Best Foreign Language Film for the Academy Awards in 1986, but was not nominated. It is currently the only Telugu film to be selected as the Indian Oscar submission.

The film was later dubbed into Tamil as &quot;Sippikkul Muthu&quot;, released on October 2, 1986. Upon its success, Viswanath directed its Hindi version &quot;Eeshwar&quot; (1989) and in Kannada it was remade as &quot;Swathi Muthu&quot; (2003).

==Plot==
Sivayya (Kamal Haasan) is an innocent orphan with a brain injury resulting in low intellectual function. He lives along with his grandmother (Nirmalamma) in a village. In that village, Lalitha (Radhika), a young widow with a five-year-old son, lives along with her brother Chalapati&#x27;s (Sarath Babu) family. She and her son often get abused by her sister-in-law (Y. Vijaya), but Lalitha, having nowhere to go, bears it all.

Sivayya often encounters Lalitha and gets appalled by her condition. One day, during Sri Rama Navami festival, Sivayya marries Lalitha, shocking all the villagers. His grandmother (Nirmalamma) approves of his marriage as she also has much sympathy and regard for Lalitha, but his uncle and Orthodox villagers oppose that marriage as they consider remarriage of a widow as a sin. In that brawl, Sivayya&#x27;s grandmother dies, leaving innocent Sivayya in the hands of Lalitha. Lalitha moves in with her husband with the blessings of her brother.

Some of the villagers help them to build a new life. Gradually, Lalitha makes Sivayya understand the household duties and responsibilities of a man. Sivayya finds work and starts to support his wife and stepson. Later they have a son and live happily for a long time. Years pass, and Lalitha becomes ill and dies in her husband&#x27;s arms. In the climax, Sivayya walks out of his house surrounded by his children and grandchildren. He carries a tulsi plant, which was his memory of Lalitha&#x27;s love.

==Production==
Arun Kumar and Venkatesh were the production designers for the film. The film was shot for nearly 70 days near the shores of Rajahmundry, Torredu, Tadikonda, Pattiseema, Chennai, and Mysore. Allu Arjun did a small role as one of the grandsons of Kamal Haasan.

The scene where Haasan dances like someone who cannot dance took so many days to get it &quot;rightly wrong&quot;, as Haasan is a seasoned dancer.

==Soundtrack==

The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.


== Reception ==
Baradwaj Rangan said in 2017, &quot;K. Viswanath, this year&#x27;s recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, made three films with Kamal Haasan. &quot;Sagara Sangamam&quot; is the best, &quot;Subha Sankalpam&quot; the weakest – and between these two films, chronologically and quality-wise, lies &quot;Swathi Muthyam&quot; (White Pearl).&quot; Reviewing the Tamil dubbed version &quot;Sippikul Muthu&quot;, Jayamanmadhan of &quot;Kalki&quot; wrote that even if it seems like an aimless story that started somewhere and suddenly stopped, the reality is that we have connected with the story until it happened.

<doc id="232315" wikidata="Q992150" url="?curid=232315" title="Numerically controlled oscillator">
<text>A numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e., clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued representation of a waveform, usually sinusoidal. NCOs are often used in conjunction with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).

Numerically controlled oscillators offer several advantages over other types of oscillators in terms of agility, accuracy, stability and reliability. NCOs are used in many communications systems including digital up/down converters used in 3G wireless and software radio systems, digital phase-locked loops, radar systems, drivers for optical or acoustic transmissions, and multilevel FSK/PSK modulators/demodulators.

==Operation==

An NCO generally consists of two parts: 
*A &quot;phase accumulator&quot; (PA), which adds to the value held at its output a frequency control value at each clock sample.
*A &quot;phase-to-amplitude converter&quot; (PAC), which uses the phase accumulator output word (phase word) usually as an index into a waveform look-up table (LUT) to provide a corresponding amplitude sample. Sometimes interpolation is used with the look-up table to provide better accuracy and reduce phase error noise. Other methods of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as power series can be used, particularly in a software NCO.

When clocked, the phase accumulator (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform which is then converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N is the number of bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.

The frequency accuracy relative to the clock frequency is limited only by the precision of the arithmetic used to compute the phase. NCOs are phase- and frequency-agile, and can be trivially modified to produce a phase-modulated or frequency-modulated output by summation at the appropriate node, or provide quadrature outputs as shown in the figure.

==Phase accumulator==

A binary phase accumulator consists of an N-bit binary adder and a register configured as shown in Figure 1. Each clock cycle produces a new N-bit output consisting of the previous output obtained from the register summed with the frequency control word (FCW) which is constant for a given output frequency. The resulting output waveform is a staircase with step size formula_1, the integer value of the FCW. In some configurations, the phase output is taken from the output of the register which introduces a one clock cycle latency but allows the adder to operate at a higher clock rate. 
The adder is designed to overflow when the sum of the absolute value of its operands exceeds its capacity (2N−1). The overflow bit is discarded so the output word width is always equal to its input word width. The remainder formula_2, called the residual, is stored in the register and the cycle repeats, starting this time from formula_2 (see figure 2). Since a phase accumulator is a finite-state machine, eventually the residual at some sample K must return to the initial value formula_4. The interval K is referred to as the grand repetition rate (GRR) given by 
:formula_5

where GCD is the greatest common divisor function. The GRR represents the true periodicity for a given formula_1 which for a high resolution NCO can be very long. Usually we are more interested in the &quot;operating frequency&quot; determined by the average overflow rate, given by
:formula_7      (1)

The &quot;frequency resolution&quot;, defined as the smallest possible incremental change in frequency, is given by
:formula_8      (2)

Equation (1) shows that the phase accumulator can be thought of as a programmable non-integer frequency divider of divide ratio formula_9.

==Phase-to-amplitude converter==
The phase-amplitude converter creates the sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word received from the PA. The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output waveform which typically is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed to reduce the amount of memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.

==Spurious products==
Spurious products are the result of harmonic or non-harmonic distortion in the creation of the output waveform due to non-linear numerical effects in the signal processing chain. Only numerical errors are covered here. For other distortion mechanisms created in the digital-to-analog converter see the corresponding section in the direct-digital synthesizer article.

===Phase truncation spurs===
The number of phase accumulator bits of an NCO (N) is usually between 16 and 64. If the PA output word were used directly to index the PAC look-up table an untenably high storage capacity in the ROM would be required. As such, the PA output word must be truncated to span a reasonable memory space. Truncation of the phase word causes phase modulation of the output sinusoid which introduces non-harmonic distortion in proportion to the number of bits truncated. The number of spurious products created by this distortion is given by:
:formula_10            (3)

where W is the number of bits truncated.

In calculating the spurious-free dynamic range, we are interested in the spurious product with the largest amplitude relative to the carrier output level given by:

:formula_11

where P is the size of the phase-to-amplitude converter&#x27;s lookup table in bits, i.e., M in Figure 1. For W &gt;4,

:formula_12

Another related spurious generation method is the slight modulation due to the GRR outlined above. The amplitude of these spurs is low for large N and their frequency is generally too low to be detectable but they may cause issues for some applications.

One way to reduce the truncation in the address lookup is to have several smaller lookup tables in parallel and use the upper bits to index into the tables and the lower bits to weigh them for linear or quadratic interpolation. Ie use a 24-bit phase accumulator to look up into two 16-bit LUTS. Address into the truncated 16 MSBs, and that plus 1. Linearly interpolate using the 8 LSBs as weights. (One could instead use 3 LUTs instead and quadratically interpolate). This can result in decreased distortion for the same amount of memory at the cost of some multipliers.

===Amplitude truncation spurs===
Another source of spurious products is the amplitude quantization of the sampled waveform contained in the PAC look up table(s). If the number of DAC bits is P, the
AM spur level is approximately equal to −6.02 P − 1.76 dBc.

===Mitigation techniques===
Phase truncation spurs can be reduced substantially by the introduction of white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.

<text>A digitally controlled oscillator or DCO is used in synthesizers, microcontrollers, and software-defined radios. The name is analogous with &quot;voltage-controlled oscillator&quot;. DCOs were designed to overcome the tuning stability limitations of early VCO designs.

== Confusion over terminology ==
The term &quot;digitally controlled oscillator&quot; has been used to describe the combination of a voltage-controlled oscillator driven by a control signal from a digital-to-analog converter, and is also sometimes used to describe numerically controlled oscillators.

This article refers specifically to the DCOs used in many synthesizers of the 1980s . These include the Roland Juno-6, Juno-60, Juno-106, JX-3P, JX-8P, and JX-10, the Elka Synthex, the Korg Poly-61, the Oberheim Matrix-6, some instruments by Akai and Kawai, and the recent Prophet &#x27;08 and its successor Rev2 by Dave Smith Instruments.

== Relation to earlier VCO designs ==

Many voltage-controlled oscillators for electronic music are based on a capacitor charging linearly in an op-amp integrator configuration. When the capacitor charge reaches a certain level, a comparator generates a reset pulse, which discharges the capacitor and the cycle begins again. This produces a rising ramp (or sawtooth) waveform, and this type of oscillator core is known as a ramp core.

A common DCO design uses a programmable counter IC such as the 8253 instead of a comparator.

This provides stable digital pitch generation by using the leading edge of a square wave to derive a reset pulse to discharge the capacitor in the oscillator&#x27;s ramp core.

== Historical context ==
In the early 1980s, many manufacturers were beginning to produce polyphonic synthesizers. The VCO designs of the time still left something to be desired in terms of tuning stability. Whilst this was an issue for monophonic synthesizers, the limited number of oscillators (typically 3 or fewer) meant that keeping instruments tuned was a manageable task, often performed using dedicated front panel controls. With the advent of polyphony, tuning problems became worse and costs went up, due to the much larger number of oscillators involved (often 16 in an 8-voice instrument like the Yamaha CS-80 from 1977 or Roland Jupiter-8 from 1981). This created a need for a cheap, reliable, and stable oscillator design. Engineers working on the problem looked to the frequency division technology used in electronic organs of the time and the microprocessors and associated chips that were starting to appear, and developed the DCO.

The DCO was seen at the time as an improvement over the unstable tuning of VCOs. However, it shared the same ramp core, and the same limited range of waveforms. Although sophisticated analogue waveshaping is possible, the greater simplicity and arbitrary waveforms of digital systems like direct digital synthesis led to most later instruments adopting entirely digital oscillator designs.

== Operation ==

A DCO can be considered as a VCO that is synchronised to an external frequency reference. The reference in this case is the reset pulses. These are produced by a digital counter such as the 8253 chip. The counter acts as a frequency divider, counting pulses from a high frequency master clock (typically several MHz) and toggling the state of its output when the count reaches some predetermined value. The frequency of the counter&#x27;s output can thus be defined by the number of pulses counted, and this generates a square wave at the required frequency.
The leading edge of this square wave is used to derive a reset pulse to discharge the capacitor in the oscillator&#x27;s ramp core. This ensures that the ramp waveform produced is of the same frequency as the counter output.

== Problems with the design ==
For a given capacitor charging current, the amplitude of the output waveform will decrease linearly with frequency. In musical terms, this means a waveform an octave higher in pitch is of half the amplitude. In order to produce a constant amplitude over the full range of the oscillator, some compensation scheme must be employed. This is often done by controlling the charging current from the same microprocessor that controls the counter reset value.

<doc id="232323" wikidata="Q277338" url="?curid=232323" title="Pseudogene">
<text>Pseudogenes are nonfunctional segments of DNA that resemble functional genes. Pseudogenes can be formed from both protein-coding genes and non-coding genes. In the case of protein-coding genes, most pseudogenes arise as superfluous copies of functional genes, either directly by gene duplication or indirectly by reverse transcription of an mRNA transcript. Pseudogenes are usually identified when genome sequence analysis finds gene-like sequences that lack regulatory sequences or are incapable of producing a functional product. Pseudogenes are a type of junk DNA.

Most non-bacterial genomes contain many pseudogenes, often as many as functional genes. This is not surprising, since various biological processes are expected to accidentally create pseudogenes, and there are no specialized mechanisms to remove them from genomes. Eventually pseudogenes may be deleted from their genomes by chance of DNA replication or DNA repair errors, or they may accumulate so many mutational changes that they are no longer recognizable as former genes. Analysis of these degeneration events helps clarify the effects of non-selective processes in genomes.

Pseudogene sequences may be transcribed into RNA at low levels, due to promoter elements inherited from the ancestral gene or arising by new mutations. Although most of these transcripts will have no more functional significance than chance transcripts from other parts of the genome, some have given rise to beneficial regulatory RNAs and new proteins.

==Properties==

Pseudogenes are usually characterized by a combination of similarity or homology to a known gene, together with a loss of some functionality. That is, although every pseudogene has a DNA sequence that is similar to some functional gene, they are usually unable to produce functional final protein products. Pseudogenes are sometimes difficult to identify and characterize in genomes, because the two requirements of similarity and loss of functionality are usually implied through sequence alignments rather than biologically proven.
#Homology is implied by sequence similarity between the DNA sequences of the pseudogene and a known gene. After aligning the two sequences, the percentage of identical base pairs is computed. A high sequence identity means that it is highly likely that these two sequences diverged from a common ancestral sequence (are homologous), and highly unlikely that these two sequences have evolved independently (see Convergent evolution).
#Nonfunctionality can manifest itself in many ways. Normally, a gene must go through several steps to a fully functional protein: Transcription, pre-mRNA processing, translation, and protein folding are all required parts of this process. If any of these steps fails, then the sequence may be considered nonfunctional. In high-throughput pseudogene identification, the most commonly identified disablements are premature stop codons and frameshifts, which almost universally prevent the translation of a functional protein product.

Pseudogenes for RNA genes are usually more difficult to discover as they do not need to be translated and thus do not have &quot;reading frames&quot;. A number of rRNA pseudogenes have been identified on the basis of changes in rDNA array ends.

Pseudogenes can complicate molecular genetic studies. For example, amplification of a gene by PCR may simultaneously amplify a pseudogene that shares similar sequences. This is known as PCR bias or amplification bias. Similarly, pseudogenes are sometimes annotated as genes in genome sequences.

Processed pseudogenes often pose a problem for gene prediction programs, often being misidentified as real genes or exons. It has been proposed that the identification of processed pseudogenes can help improve the accuracy of gene prediction methods.

In 2014, 140 human pseudogenes have been shown to be translated. However, the function, if any, of the protein products is unknown.

==Types and origin==
There are four main types of pseudogenes, all with distinct mechanisms of origin and characteristic features. The classifications of pseudogenes are as follows:

===Processed===

In higher eukaryotes, particularly mammals, retrotransposition is a fairly common event that has had a huge impact on the composition of the genome. For example, somewhere between 30 and 44% of the human genome consists of repetitive elements such as SINEs and LINEs (see retrotransposons). In the process of retrotransposition, a portion of the mRNA or hnRNA transcript of a gene is spontaneously reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted into chromosomal DNA. Although retrotransposons usually create copies of themselves, it has been shown in an &quot;in vitro&quot; system that they can create retrotransposed copies of random genes, too. Once these pseudogenes are inserted back into the genome, they usually contain a poly-A tail, and usually have had their introns spliced out; these are both hallmark features of cDNAs. However, because they are derived from an RNA product, processed pseudogenes also lack the upstream promoters of normal genes; thus, they are considered &quot;dead on arrival&quot;, becoming non-functional pseudogenes immediately upon the retrotransposition event. However, these insertions occasionally contribute exons to existing genes, usually via alternatively spliced transcripts. A further characteristic of processed pseudogenes is common truncation of the 5&#x27; end relative to the parent sequence, which is a result of the relatively non-processive retrotransposition mechanism that creates processed pseudogenes. Processed pseudogenes are continually being created in primates. Human populations, for example, have distinct sets of processed pseudogenes across its individuals.

It has been shown that processed pseudogenes accumulate mutations faster than non-processed pseudogenes.

===Non-processed (duplicated)===

Gene duplication is another common and important process in the evolution of genomes. A copy of a functional gene may arise as a result of a gene duplication event caused by homologous recombination at, for example, repetitive SINE sequences on misaligned chromosomes and subsequently acquire mutations that cause the copy to lose the original gene&#x27;s function. Duplicated pseudogenes usually have all the same characteristics as genes, including an intact exon-intron structure and regulatory sequences. The loss of a duplicated gene&#x27;s functionality usually has little effect on an organism&#x27;s fitness, since an intact functional copy still exists. According to some evolutionary models, shared duplicated pseudogenes indicate the evolutionary relatedness of humans and the other primates. If pseudogenization is due to gene duplication, it usually occurs in the first few million years after the gene duplication, provided the gene has not been subjected to any selection pressure. Gene duplication generates functional redundancy and it is not normally advantageous to carry two identical genes. Mutations that disrupt either the structure or the function of either of the two genes are not deleterious and will not be removed through the selection process. As a result, the gene that has been mutated gradually becomes a pseudogene and will be either unexpressed or functionless. This kind of evolutionary fate is shown by population genetic modeling and also by genome analysis. According to evolutionary context, these pseudogenes will either be deleted or become so distinct from the parental genes so that they will no longer be identifiable. Relatively young pseudogenes can be recognized due to their sequence similarity.

===Unitary pseudogenes===

Various mutations (such as indels and nonsense mutations) can prevent a gene from being normally transcribed or translated, and thus the gene may become less- or non-functional or &quot;deactivated&quot;. These are the same mechanisms by which non-processed genes become pseudogenes, but the difference in this case is that the gene was not duplicated before pseudogenization. Normally, such a pseudogene would be unlikely to become fixed in a population, but various population effects, such as genetic drift, a population bottleneck, or, in some cases, natural selection, can lead to fixation. The classic example of a unitary pseudogene is the gene that presumably coded the enzyme L-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase (GULO) in primates. In all mammals studied besides primates (except guinea pigs), GULO aids in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), but it exists as a disabled gene (GULOP) in humans and other primates. Another more recent example of a disabled gene links the deactivation of the caspase 12 gene (through a nonsense mutation) to positive selection in humans.

=== Polymorphic pseudogenes ===
Some pseudogenes are still intact in some individuals but inactivated (mutated) in others. Abascal et al. have called these pseudogenes &quot;polymorphic&quot;. They are often homozygous for loss-of-function (LoF) variants, that is, in many people both copies are inactive. Polymorphic pseudogenes often represent non-essential (or dispensable) genes, as opposed to essential genes, and their frequent mutations are actually a criterion to establish them as non-essential. Lopes-Marques et al. define polymorphic pseudogenes as genes that carry a LoF allele with a frequency higher than 1% (in global or certain sub-populations) and without overt pathogenic consequences when homozygous.

==Examples of pseudogene function==
While the vast majority of pseudogenes have lost their function, some cases have emerged in which a pseudogene either re-gained its original or a similar function or evolved a new function. In the human genome, a number of examples have been identified that were originally classified as pseudogenes but later discovered to have a functional, although not necessarily protein-coding, role.

Examples include the following:

=== Protein-coding: &quot;&quot; ===
The rapid proliferation of DNA sequencing technologies has led to the identification of many apparent pseudogenes using gene prediction techniques. Pseudogenes are often identified by the appearance of a premature stop codon in a predicted mRNA sequence, which would, in theory, prevent synthesis (translation) of the normal protein product of the original gene. There have been some reports of translational readthrough of such premature stop codons in mammals. As alluded to in the figure above, a small amount of the protein product of such readthrough may still be recognizable and function at some level. If so, the pseudogene can be subject to natural selection. That appears to have happened during the evolution of &quot;Drosophila&quot; species.

In 2016 it was reported that four predicted pseudogenes in multiple &quot;Drosophila&quot; species actually encode proteins with biologically important functions, &quot;suggesting that such &#x27;pseudo-pseudogenes&#x27; could represent a widespread phenomenon&quot;. For example, the functional protein (a glutamate olfactory receptor) from gene Ir75a is found only in neurons. This finding of tissue-specific biologically-functional genes that could have been classified as pseudogenes by &quot;in silico&quot; analysis complicates the analysis of sequence data. Another &quot;Drosophilia&quot; pseudo-pseudogene is &quot;jingwei&quot;, which encodes a functional alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme &quot;in vivo&quot;.

As of 2012, it appeared that there are approximately 12,000–14,000 pseudogenes in the human genome. A 2016 proteogenomics analysis using mass spectrometry of peptides identified at least 19,262 human proteins produced from 16,271 genes or clusters of genes, with 8 new protein-coding genes identified that were previously considered pseudogenes. An earlier analysis found that human PGAM4 (phosphoglycerate mutase), previously thought to be a pseudogene, is not only functional, but also causes infertility if mutated.

A number of pseudo-pseudogenes were also found in prokaryotes, where some stop codon substitutions in essential genes appear to be retained, even positively selected for.

=== Non-protein-coding ===

siRNAs. Some endogenous siRNAs appear to be derived from pseudogenes, and thus some pseudogenes play a role in regulating protein-coding transcripts, as reviewed. One of the many examples is psiPPM1K. Processing of RNAs transcribed from psiPPM1K yield siRNAs that can act to suppress the most common type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma. This and much other research has led to considerable excitement about the possibility of targeting pseudogenes with/as therapeutic agents

piRNAs. Some piRNAs are derived from pseudogenes located in piRNA clusters. Those piRNAs regulate genes via the piRNA pathway in mammalian testes and are crucial for limiting transposable element damage to the genome.microRNAs. There are many reports of pseudogene transcripts acting as microRNA decoys. Perhaps the earliest definitive example of such a pseudogene involved in cancer is the pseudogene of BRAF. The BRAF gene is a proto-oncogene that, when mutated, is associated with many cancers. Normally, the amount of BRAF protein is kept under control in cells through the action of miRNA. In normal situations, the amount of RNA from BRAF and the pseudogene BRAFP1 compete for miRNA, but the balance of the 2 RNAs is such that cells grow normally. However, when BRAFP1 RNA expression is increased (either experimentally or by natural mutations), less miRNA is available to control the expression of BRAF, and the increased amount of BRAF protein causes cancer. This sort of competition for regulatory elements by RNAs that are endogenous to the genome has given rise to the term ceRNA.

PTEN. The PTEN gene is a known tumor suppressor gene. The PTEN pseudogene, PTENP1 is a processed pseudogene that is very similar in its genetic sequence to the wild-type gene. However, PTENP1 has a missense mutation which eliminates the codon for the initiating methionine and thus prevents translation of the normal PTEN protein. In spite of that, PTENP1 appears to play a role in oncogenesis. The 3&#x27; UTR of PTENP1 mRNA functions as a decoy of PTEN mRNA by targeting micro RNAs due to its similarity to the PTEN gene, and overexpression of the 3&#x27; UTR resulted in an increase of PTEN protein level. That is, overexpression of the PTENP1 3&#x27; UTR leads to increased regulation and suppression of cancerous tumors. The biology of this system is basically the inverse of the BRAF system described above.

Potogenes. Pseudogenes can, over evolutionary time scales, participate in gene conversion and other mutational events that may give rise to new or newly functional genes. This has led to the concept that pseudogenes could be viewed as potogenes: potential genes for evolutionary diversification.

==Bacterial pseudogenes==
Pseudogenes are found in bacteria. Most are found in bacteria that are not free-living; that is, they are either symbionts or obligate intracellular parasites. Thus, they do not require many genes that are needed by free-living bacteria, such as gene associated with metabolism and DNA repair. However, there is not an order to which functional genes are lost first. For example, the oldest pseudogenes in &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; are in RNA polymerases and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites while the oldest ones in &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot; and &quot;Shigella typhi&quot; are in DNA replication, recombination, and repair.

Since most bacteria that carry pseudogenes are either symbionts or obligate intracellular parasites, genome size eventually reduces. An extreme example is the genome of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;, an obligate parasite and the causative agent of leprosy. It has been reported to have 1,133 pseudogenes which give rise to approximately 50% of its transcriptome. The effect of pseudogenes and genome reduction can be further seen when compared to &quot;Mycobacterium marinum&quot;, a pathogen from the same family. &quot;Mycobacteirum marinum&quot; has a larger genome compared to &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; because it can survive outside the host; therefore, the genome must contain the genes needed to do so.

Although genome reduction focuses on what genes are not needed by getting rid of pseudogenes, selective pressures from the host can sway what is kept. In the case of a symbiont from the &quot;Verrucomicrobiota&quot; phylum, there are seven additional copies of the gene coding the mandelalide pathway. The host, species from &quot;Lissoclinum&quot;, use mandelalides as part of its defense mechanism.

The relationship between epistasis and the domino theory of gene loss was observed in &quot;Buchnera aphidicola&quot;. The domino theory suggests that if one gene of a cellular process becomes inactivated, then selection in other genes involved relaxes, leading to gene loss. When comparing &quot;Buchnera aphidicola&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli,&quot; it was found that positive epistasis furthers gene loss while negative epistasis hinders it.

<doc id="232324" wikidata="Q3547264" url="?curid=232324" title="Unison (trade union)">
<text>Unison (stylised as UNISON) is a British trade union. Along with Unite, Unison is one of the two largest trade unions in the United Kingdom, with over 1.2 million members who work predominantly in public services, including local government, education, health and outsourced services.

The union was formed in 1993 when three public sector trade unions, the National and Local Government Officers Association (NALGO), the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) and the Confederation of Health Service Employees (COHSE) merged. UNISON&#x27;s current general secretary is Christina McAnea, who replaced Dave Prentis in 2021.

==Members and organisation==

Members of UNISON are typically from industries within the public sector and generally cover both full-time and part-time support and administrative staff. The majority of people joining UNISON are workers within sectors such as local government, education, the National Health Service Registered Nurses, NHS Managers and Clinical Support Workers. The union also admits ancillary staff such as Health Care Assistants and Assistant Practitioners, including Allied Health Professionals. Probation services, police services, utilities (such as gas, electricity and water), and transport. These &#x27;Service Groups&#x27; all have their own national and regional democratic structures within UNISON&#x27;s constitution.

As a trade union, UNISON provides support to members on work related issues, including protection and representation at work, help with pay and conditions of service and legal advice. Each company or organisation will usually be represented by a particular UNISON branch and members within that organisation elect volunteer stewards to represent them. The stewards receive training in workplace issues and are then able to co-ordinate and represent members both on an individual basis and collectively.

Each branch is run by an annually elected committee of members which holds regular meetings, including an annual general meeting for all members to attend. Branches elect delegates to the union&#x27;s annual National Delegate Conference (held in June every year), the supreme body within the union&#x27;s constitution with responsibility for setting the union&#x27;s policies for the forthcoming year.

UNISON own and operate a holiday resort, UNISON Croyde Bay Resort, in North Devon. Members receive a 15% discount as well as have access to a 50% low paid member discount scheme.

To encourage all voices to be heard UNISON has &quot;self organised groups&quot; of Black members, women members, lesbian, gay, bisexual &amp; transgender plus members, and disabled members. Young members and retired members also have their own sections within the union.

===Membership numbers===

Membership numbers have remained relatively stable at between 1.2 and 1.4 million over the past 17 years.
===Membership fees===
The levels of subscription are determined by the National Delegate Conference and are recorded as a Schedule in the union rules. The National Delegate Conference has the power to vary the subscriptions levied after a majority vote, although the subscription rates do not change frequently.

Local branches may also, after a majority vote of members, impose an additional &#x27;Local Levy&#x27; as long as the levy does not exceed one sixth of the subscription payable. This is in addition to the standard rate, and must be used for local branch purposes.

Membership fees vary depending on how frequently members are paid and the level of their current salary. Subscriptions are generally paid by what is commonly known as &quot;check-off&quot; or DOCAS (Deduction of Contributions at Source). This is where the employer deducts the contribution from the employee&#x27;s salary on behalf of the union. Payment is taken by Direct Debit if the member joins online, if the member specifically requests it, or if there is no DOCAS arrangement with the employer.

Student members in full-time education (including student nurses or Modern Apprentices) have a fixed rate subscription of £10 per year.

Members who have had continuous membership for at least two years may opt to pay a one-off fee of £15 upon retirement from paid employment. This allows them to retain the benefits of being a union member for life. They are then classed as &#x27;Retired Members&#x27;.

Members who are dismissed or made redundant from employment may retain their membership for £4 per year for a period of up to two years whilst they remain unemployed.

=== Membership campaigns ===

Various local campaigns are run by the union. Much of the recruitment within organisations takes place at a local level, with stewards and branches directly engaging with the staff within their remit.

The national organisation also engages in publicity such as the &quot;Ants and Bear&quot;, which was used at the formation of the new amalgamated union. This advertising campaign showed an ant trying to get past a large bear by shouting &quot;Excuse Me&quot;, however the bear did not pay attention. The next scene showed the ant being joined by many thousands more, and them all saying &quot;Get out of the way!&quot; together, which does get the bear&#x27;s attention and makes him move out of the way.
The General Political Fund funded a TV recruitment advert &quot;You&#x27;re one in a million&quot; launched in October 2004.

==Political work==

UNISON has a political fund which uses money from members for political and social campaigning. Members have the choice of paying into either a fund which supports the Labour Party, a non-affiliated General Political Fund or to opt out of contributing to a political fund at all. UNISON also carries out research and campaigns on public service issues, such as the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). It has also voted (at its 2005 annual conference) to oppose the Government&#x27;s proposals for a British national identity card.

Every UNISON region (except Northern Ireland) has a Labour Link Officer who works with the regional Labour Link committees. They are also the first point of contact for UNISON&#x27;s involvement in Labour Party activities in each region.

The union&#x27;s links to Labour and its moderate policies has caused some conflict and criticism of action taken against left-wing activists.

In April 2009 a UNISON conference voted unanimously to request that the British Department of Health ban members of the British National Party from working as nurses in the National Health Service, describing the party as racist.

===Political campaigns===
UNISON runs a range of national campaigns, such as &#x27;Positively Public&#x27;, the campaign to keep public services public and well-funded. Campaigns cover a broad area from pay and pensions to sector-specific initiatives focusing on a variety of issues from cleaner hospitals to opposing the sell-off of public housing.

They are affiliated to the Abortion Rights organisation, which campaigns &quot;to defend and extend women&#x27;s rights and access to safe, legal abortion&quot;.

Unison ran a campaign to &quot;end the two tier workforce&quot;, affecting staff employed by government contractors, with a motion carried at its 2004 National Delegate Conference. A two-tier workforce arises when employees are transferred from the public sector (e.g. a local authority or the NHS) to a private sector organisation on protected rates of pay and working conditions whereas new employees are appointed on lower rates of pay and poorer working conditions, leading to two tiers of pay and conditions. The union&#x27;s strategy was to:
*identify inequalities and the worker groups, contracts, companies and public bodies involved, and publicly expose them;
*use equality tools such as the statutory duty under the Race Relations Act (now the Equality Act 2010) and Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to challenge the continuation of contracts which widen inequality;
*expose ministers, government departments and public bodies to scrutiny, and
*produce guidance for UNISON&#x27;s bargainers at all levels on how to effectively challenge this form of discrimination. In July 2015, UNISON endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

There have also been high-profile regional and local campaigns, such as that against the controversial and unpopular &#x27;SouthWest One&#x27; private/public partnership.

The General Political Fund has also funded:

* Anti-racist events
* Local campaigns against privatisation/marketisation
* UNISON presence at various national and regional events
* Campaigns against council housing sell-off

In the run-up to several general or local elections, the fund has been used for advertising campaigns to ensure that issues of importance to UNISON are high on the agenda. Its 2010 campaign was entitled &quot;Million Voices for Public Services&quot;.

The GPF is not affiliated to any political party, but the money in the fund is used to support local campaigns and to pay for political advertising.

In February 2013, UNISON was among other organizations and individuals who gave their support to the People&#x27;s Assembly in a letter published by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. UNISON Delegates and representatives attended the People&#x27;s Assembly Conference held at Westminster Central Hall on 22 June 2013.

In August 2016 UNISON endorsed Jeremy Corbyn once again.

In the 2020 Labour leadership and deputy leadership elections, UNISON endorsed Keir Starmer for leader and Angela Rayner for deputy.

==Internal elections==
===2015 General Secretary election===
Dave Prentis was re-elected in an election with 49.4% of the vote with a 9.8% turnout of members.

===2020 General Secretary election===
General Secretary Dave Prentis stood down in December 2020, having held the post since 1 January 2001. Four candidates received enough nominations to be on the ballot: Paul Holmes, Christina McAnea, Roger McKenzie and Hugo Pierre. Peter Sharma and Margaret Greer stood and did not get onto the ballot, Voting for the General Secretary election took place from 18 October to 27 November, with the results announced on 11 January 2021.

Holmes was endorsed by UNISON&#x27;s left-wing faction &quot;UNISON Action Broad Left&quot; and was employed by Kirklees Council. During the campaign he was suspended from his role and investigated for reasons deemed &quot;serious and confidential&quot; by the council. McAnea was an Assistant General Secretary for UNISON and previously the head of its NHS division. She was considered &quot;closely aligned&quot; to Prentis and his leadership.
458 of 834 branches participated in nominating candidates for the election, higher than the 2015 General Secretary election which saw 373 participate.

Christina McAnea was elected with 47.7% of the total votes cast.
Of the 1,278,971 UNISON members at the time of election 134,082 votes were cast, a turnout of 10.5%.

===2021-22 National Elections===
On 11 June 2021 the National Executive Committee (NEC) elections took place. A slate represented the left-wing of the union &#x27;Time For Real Change&#x27; stood and won 40 of the 68 seats. Paul Holmes was selected as union president by the new NEC. In November 2021, the Labour Link Committee was elected. The left-wing &#x27;Time For Real Change&#x27; slate won a slim majority on the committee, with 6 of the 11 seats.

In 2022 the 11 Service Executive Committees will be elected.

In February 2022 the new union president, Paul Holmes, was dismissed as an employee of Kirklees Council after a disciplinary action of over two years. A campaign alleging he had been the victim of anti-union discrimination began. Details of the council investigation had been leaked to the media in December 2021.

<text>Swathi Kiranam () is a 1992 Telugu-language musical drama film directed by K. Viswanath. Produced by V. Madhusudhana Rao, the film starred Mammootty in his Telugu debut, Master Manjunath and Radhika, along with Achyuth, Jayanthi, Sakshi Ranga Rao, Dubbing Janaki and Dharmavarapu Subramanyam in supporting roles. The film is about an egotistical music teacher envious of the immense talent of his prodigious young disciple, and depicts their tumultuous relationship.

Swathi Kiranam was featured in the Indian panorama section of the 24th IFFI, the Asia Pacific Film Festival, the Moscow Film Festival and the AISFM Film Festival. The film has garnered the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer, Filmfare Award for Best Music Direction and the Akkineni Award for Best Home-viewing Feature Film. Over the years, the film has accumulated a cult following for its music, and lyrics. The lyrics were penned by Vennelakanti Rajeswara Prasad, Sirivennela Seetarama Sastry, C. Narayana Reddy, and Madugula Nagaphani Sharma.

==Plot==
The film starts with a shabby old man living as a recluse near a famous temple in Tapeswaram. When he ventures out into the village, he is beaten by the shepherds who believe that he is a thief. When they hand him over to the police, the officer in charge identifies him as a once-famous musician, Anantha Rama Sharma (Mammooty), hailed as Sangeeta Samrat (Emperor of music), who has been missing for four years. The inspector Radhakrishna (Achyuth) informs his aunt (Jayanthi), who teaches yoga and music in his native village, of this and the past of Anantha Sharma which is narrated through flashback.

; Flashback begins
Anantha Rama Sharma is a widely respected egoistic Carnatic composer and singer with inflated self-esteem. This is established when he rejects the &quot;Padma Shri&quot; bestowed upon him by the Government of India, as he believes that the other awardees are not worthy to be mentioned alongside him.

Gangadhar (Master Manjunath) lives in the same village. He rejects the society&#x27;s norms (taking music classes and going to school) and spends his time sitting by the riverside. The river inspires him to sing many songs in different tunes. His music teacher, also the policeman&#x27;s aunt, recognizes his talent and tries to nurture it. His school teacher (the music teacher&#x27;s brother) is also fond of Gangadhar.

Gangadhar wants to become a great carnatic composer and singer, like Anantha Sharma, and his father (Dharmavarapu) encourages him. Gangadhar starts performing (&quot;Pranathi Pranathi&quot;) at the Tapeswaram Meher Baba&#x27;s ashram in front of Anantha Sharma and impresses him. His day comes when Anantha Sharma is honoured with lifetime achievement award at a concert. Gangadhar sings (&quot;Aanathi Neeyara&quot;) in honour of Anantha Sharma, which many consider to be much better than any of Anantha Sharma&#x27;s works. The boy is hailed as a child prodigy by everyone including Anantha Sharma&#x27;s wife.

Anantha Sharma wants to imprison Gangadhar&#x27;s talents. So he asks Gangadhar to stay in his house and learn music as one must be well-experienced to sing on stage. Anantha Sharma makes Gangadhar compose tunes (which is required by him to perform at various concerts), but he always acts unimpressed by Gangadhar&#x27;s exceptional compositions. Anantha Sharma performs one of Gangadhar&#x27;s powerful compositions (&quot;Shivani Bhavani&quot;) at Ganapathi Sachchidananda&#x27;s ashram in Gangadhar&#x27;s absence but Gangadhar arrives at the concert whilst Anantha is performing Gangadhar&#x27;s tune. Ananta&#x27;s wife also finds the hidden stash of all tunes composed by Gangadhar. He now feels guilty and defends himself by saying that he did it because he was afraid this child would destroy his name and fame.

In this emotional moment, he suffers a heart attack. To show his gratitude towards his adopted mother, Gangadhar kills himself so that there is no competition for Anantha Sharma. The incident shocks the villagers and they call Anantha Sharma a murderer. To escape their wrath and insults, he runs away and becomes a recluse.
;Flashback ends

Ananta Sharma is still unconscious while in the police station. When he awakens, he finds himself in the house of Gangadhar&#x27;s music teacher. The music teacher&#x27;s husband tells him that they have forgiven him and asks him to return to his house. At his house, he finds his wife giving music classes (an institute named &quot;Gangadhar Music Academy&quot;) for young children. He sits down among the children learning the basics from his wife.

==Cast==
==Production==
Director K Viswanath had approached S. P. Balasubrahmanyam to dub for Mammootty in the film. According to SPB, he was ready dub for a great actor like Mammootty. But Mammootty asked the director if he can dub it himself in Telugu with his own voice, even though he did not know Telugu at the time. According to SPB, he said: &quot;I can work hard. If you still do not like it, just do it with Balu Sir.&quot; But nothing like this came about. According to SPB, the film was dubbed by Mammootty himself. Though he could not provide the voice, it was SPB who sang the song for Mammootty in the film.

During the composing sessions of this film, the music director K. V. Mahadevan was hospitalized. Hence his close associate and disciple Pughazhendi composed all the songs in the film. But due to his devotion towards the music director, he credited K. V. Mahadevan&#x27;s name instead of himself. The song “Aanati Neeyara” is written in Thyagaraja Pancharatna Krithi style by Sirivennela Sitaramasastry. Pancharatna Krithis are unique compositions where there are numerous charanams which progress into a crescendo. This song fetched Vani Jayaram the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer. This film is the only film to have same lyrical compositions sung by different singers. But with strikingly different compositions. &quot;Pranathi Pranathi&quot; is first sung in Naata by the character of Mammootty which is tuned in a different way again for Master Manjunath to sing brilliantly. The song &quot;Shivani Bhavani&quot; is sung in the same tune but with different emotional levels by the two lead characters Anantha Sharma (Mammootty) and Gangadharam (Master Manjunath) respectively. This film also marked the first and last collaboration of veteran singers Vani Jayaram and K. S. Chithra.

==Soundtrack==
==Reception==
The film was released on 1 January 1992 on New Year&#x27;s Day to widespread critical acclaim. In a retrospect interview of the film by &quot;iQlik Movies&quot;, they call the film an unmistakable epic by writing: &quot;&quot;Swathi Kiranam&quot; is called an unmistakable epic because it explores the hidden side of a successful Carnatic Music singer - his inner fears, his insecurities just because he watches a child prodigy grow in front of his own eyes.&quot; They further go on to praise the performance of the lead cast. They then praise the script, writing: &quot;Dialogues written by Jandhyala are thought provoking and heart touching. The line where a tormented Gangadharam says ,” Mimmalni choosthe maa amma gari la anipisthunnaru..kaani ayyagaru endhuku thandri la kanipinchatledho ardham kavatledhu” (“While I can see a mother in you, I don’t know why I am unable to see a father in sir!”) to Anantha Sharma&#x27;s wife can make anybody tearful.&quot; &quot;Idlebrain&quot; included the film in its series of &quot;films that were box-office failures but, that deserve to be ranked as some of the best movies of Telugu industry.&quot;

<doc id="232328" wikidata="Q243705" url="?curid=232328" title="Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury">
<text>Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury (; 3 February 183022 August 1903), known as Lord Salisbury, was a British statesman and Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times for a total of over thirteen years. He was also Foreign Secretary before and during most of his tenure. He avoided international alignments or alliances, maintaining the policy of &quot;splendid isolation&quot;.

Lord Robert Cecil, later known as Lord Salisbury, was first elected to the House of Commons in 1854 and served as Secretary of State for India in Lord Derby&#x27;s Conservative government 1866–1867. In 1874, under Disraeli, Salisbury returned as Secretary of State for India, and, in 1878, was appointed foreign secretary, and played a leading part in the Congress of Berlin. After Disraeli&#x27;s death in 1881, Salisbury emerged as the Conservative leader in the House of Lords, with Sir Stafford Northcote leading the party in the Commons. He succeeded William Ewart Gladstone as prime minister in June 1885, and held the office until January 1886.

When Gladstone came out in favour of Home Rule for Ireland later that year, Salisbury opposed him and formed an alliance with the breakaway Liberal Unionists, winning the subsequent 1886 general election. His biggest achievement in this term was obtaining the majority of the new territory in Africa during the Scramble for Africa, avoiding a war or serious confrontation with the other powers. He remained as prime minister until Gladstone&#x27;s Liberals formed a government with the support of the Irish nationalists at the 1892 general election. The Liberals, however, lost the 1895 general election, and Salisbury for the third and last time became prime minister. He led Britain to victory in a bitter, controversial war against the Boers, and led the Unionists to another electoral victory in 1900. He relinquished the premiership to his nephew Arthur Balfour in 1902 and died in 1903. He was the last prime minister to serve from the House of Lords throughout the entirety of their premiership.

Historians agree that Salisbury was a strong and effective leader in foreign affairs, with a wide grasp of the issues. Paul Smith characterises his personality as &quot;deeply neurotic, depressive, agitated, introverted, fearful of change and loss of control, and self-effacing but capable of extraordinary competitiveness.&quot; A representative of the landed aristocracy, he held the reactionary credo, &quot;Whatever happens will be for the worse, and therefore it is in our interest that as little should happen as possible.&quot; Searle says that instead of seeing his party&#x27;s victory in 1886 as a harbinger of a new and more popular Conservatism, Salisbury longed to return to the stability of the past, when his party&#x27;s main function was to restrain what he saw as demagogic liberalism and democratic excess. He is generally ranked in the upper tier of British prime ministers.

==Early life: 1830–1852==
Lord Robert Cecil was born at Hatfield House, the third son of the 2nd Marquess of Salisbury and Frances Mary, &quot;née&quot; Gascoyne. He was a patrilineal descendant of Lord Burghley and the 1st Earl of Salisbury, chief ministers of Elizabeth I. The family-owned vast rural estates in Hertfordshire and Dorset. This wealth increased sharply in 1821, when his father married his mother, Frances Mary Gascoyne, heiress of a wealthy merchant and Member of Parliament who had bought large estates in Essex and Lancashire.

Robert had a miserable childhood, with few friends, and filled his time with reading. He was bullied unmercifully at the schools he attended. In 1840, he went to Eton College, where he did well in French, German, Classics, and Theology, but left in 1845 because of intense bullying. His unhappy schooling shaped his pessimistic outlook on life and his negative views on democracy. He decided that most people were cowardly and cruel, and that the mob would run roughshod over sensitive individuals.

In December 1847, he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he received an honorary fourth class in Mathematics, conferred by nobleman&#x27;s privilege due to ill health. Whilst at Oxford, he found the Oxford movement or &quot;Tractarianism&quot; to be an intoxicating force, and had an intense religious experience that shaped his life. He was involved in the Oxford Union, serving as its secretary and treasurer. In 1853, he was elected a prize fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.

In April 1850, he joined Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but did not enjoy law. His doctor advised him to travel for his health, and so, from July 1851 to May 1853, Cecil travelled through Cape Colony, Australia, including Tasmania, and New Zealand. He disliked the Boers and wrote that free institutions and self-government could not be granted to the Cape Colony because the Boers outnumbered the British three-to-one, and &quot;it will simply be delivering us over bound hand and foot into the power of the Dutch, who hate us as much as a conquered people can hate their conquerors&quot;. He found the Native South Africans &quot;a fine set of men – whose language bears traces of a very high former civilisation&quot;, similar to Italian. They were &quot;an intellectual race, with great firmness and fixedness of will&quot; but &quot;horribly immoral&quot; because they lacked theism.

At the Bendigo goldfields in Australia, he claimed that &quot;there is not half as much crime or insubordination as there would be in an English town of the same wealth and population&quot;. Ten thousand miners were policed by four men armed with carbines and, at Mount Alexander, 30,000 people were protected by 200 policemen, with over of gold mined per week. He believed that there was &quot;generally far more civility than I should be likely to find in the good town of Hatfield&quot; and claimed that was due to &quot;the government was that of the Queen, not of the mob; from above, not from below. Holding from a supposed right (whether real or not, no matter)&quot; and from &quot;the People the source of all legitimate power,&quot; Cecil said of the Māori of New Zealand: &quot;The natives seem when they have converted to make much better Christians than the white man&quot;. A Maori chief offered Cecil near Auckland, which he declined.

==Member of Parliament: 1853–1866==

Cecil entered the House of Commons as a Conservative on 22 August 1853, as MP for Stamford in Lincolnshire. He retained this seat until he succeeded to his father&#x27;s peerages in 1868 and it was not contested during his time as its representative. In his election address, he opposed secular education and &quot;ultramontane&quot; interference with the Church of England which was &quot;at variance with the fundamental principles of our constitution&quot;. He would oppose &quot;any such tampering with our representative system as shall disturb the reciprocal powers on which the stability of our constitution rests&quot;. In 1867, after his brother Eustace complained of being addressed by constituents in a hotel, Cecil responded: &quot;A hotel infested by influential constituents is worse than one infested by bugs. It&#x27;s a pity you can&#x27;t carry around a powder insecticide to get rid of vermin of that kind&quot;.

In December 1856 Cecil began publishing articles for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, to which he contributed anonymously for the next nine years. From 1861 to 1864 he published 422 articles in it; in total the weekly published 608 of his articles. The &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; was the foremost conservative journal of the age and of the twenty-six issues published between spring 1860 and summer 1866, Cecil had anonymous articles in all but three of them. He also wrote lead articles for the Tory daily newspaper the &quot;Standard&quot;. In 1859 Cecil was a founding co-editor of &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Quarterly Review&quot;, with John Douglas Cook and Rev. William Scott; but it closed after four issues.

Salisbury criticised the foreign policy of Lord John Russell, claiming he was &quot;always being willing to sacrifice anything for peace... colleagues, principles, pledges... a portentous mixture of bounce and baseness... dauntless to the weak, timid and cringing to the strong&quot;. The lessons to be learnt from Russell&#x27;s foreign policy, Salisbury believed, were that he should not listen to the opposition or the press otherwise &quot;we are to be governed... by a set of weathercocks, delicately poised, warranted to indicate with unnerving accuracy every variation in public feeling&quot;. Secondly: &quot;No one dreams of conducting national affairs with the principles which are prescribed to individuals. The meek and poor-spirited among nations are not to be blessed, and the common sense of Christendom has always prescribed for national policy principles diametrically opposed to those that are laid down in the Sermon on the Mount&quot;. Thirdly: &quot;The assemblies that meet in Westminster have no jurisdiction over the affairs of other nations. Neither they nor the Executive, except in plain defiance of international law, can interfere [in the internal affairs of other countries]... It is not a dignified position for a Great Power to occupy, to be pointed out as the busybody of Christendom&quot;. Finally, Britain should not threaten other countries unless prepared to back this up by force: &quot;A willingness to fight is the &quot;point d&#x27;appui&quot; of diplomacy, just as much as a readiness to go to court is the starting point of a lawyer&#x27;s letter. It is merely courting dishonour, and inviting humiliation for the men of peace to use the habitual language of the men of war&quot;.

==Secretary of State for India: 1866–1867==
In 1866 Cecil, now known by the courtesy title Viscount Cranborne after the death of his brother, entered the third government of Lord Derby as Secretary of State for India. When in 1867 John Stuart Mill proposed a type of proportional representation, Cranborne argued that: &quot;It was not of our atmosphere—it was not in accordance with our habits; it did not belong to us. They all knew that it could not pass. Whether that was creditable to the House or not was a question into which he would not inquire; but every Member of the House the moment he saw the scheme upon the Paper saw that it belonged to the class of impracticable things&quot;.

On 2 August when the Commons debated the Orissa famine in India, Cranborne spoke out against experts, political economy, and the government of Bengal. Utilising the Blue Books, Cranborne criticised officials for &quot;walking in a dream... in superb unconsciousness, believing that what had been must be, and that as long as they did nothing absolutely wrong, and they did not displease their immediate superiors, they had fulfilled all the duties of their station&quot;. These officials worshipped political economy &quot;as a sort of &#x27;fetish&#x27;... [they] seemed to have forgotten utterly that human life was short, and that man did not subsist without food beyond a few days&quot;. Three-quarters of a million people had died because officials had chosen &quot;to run the risk of losing the lives than to run the risk of wasting the money&quot;. Cranborne&#x27;s speech was received with &quot;an enthusiastic, hearty cheer from both sides of the House&quot; and Mill crossed the floor of the Commons to congratulate him on it. The famine left Cranborne with a lifelong suspicion of experts and in the photograph albums at his home covering the years 1866–67 there are two images of skeletal Indian children amongst the family pictures.

===Reform Act 1867===
When parliamentary reform came to prominence again in the mid-1860s, Cranborne worked hard to master electoral statistics until he became an expert. When the Liberal Reform Bill was being debated in 1866, Cranborne studied the census returns to see how each clause in the Bill would affect the electoral prospects in each seat. Cranborne did not expect Disraeli&#x27;s conversion to reform, however. When the Cabinet met on 16 February 1867, Disraeli voiced his support for some extension of the suffrage, providing statistics amassed by Robert Dudley Baxter, showing that 330,000 people would be given the vote and all except 60,000 would be granted extra votes.

Cranborne studied Baxter&#x27;s statistics and on 21 February he met Lord Carnarvon, who wrote in his diary: &quot;He is firmly convinced now that Disraeli has played us false, that he is attempting to hustle us into his measure, that Lord Derby is in his hands and that the present form which the question has now assumed has been long planned by him&quot;. They agreed to &quot;a sort of offensive and defensive alliance on this question in the Cabinet&quot; to &quot;prevent the Cabinet adopting any very fatal course&quot;. Disraeli had &quot;separate and confidential conversations...carried on with each member of the Cabinet from whom he anticipated opposition [which] had divided them and lulled their suspicions&quot;. That same night Cranborne spent three hours studying Baxter&#x27;s statistics and wrote to Carnarvon the day after that although Baxter was right overall in claiming that 30% of £10 ratepayers who qualified for the vote would not register, it would be untrue in relation to the smaller boroughs where the register is kept up to date. Cranborne also wrote to Derby arguing that he should adopt 10 shillings rather than Disraeli&#x27;s 20 shillings for the qualification of the payers of direct taxation: &quot;Now above 10 shillings you won&#x27;t get in the large mass of the £20 householders. At 20 shillings I fear you won&#x27;t get more than 150,000 double voters, instead of the 270,000 on which we counted. And I fear this will tell horribly on the small and middle-sized boroughs&quot;.

On 23 February Cranborne protested in Cabinet and the next day analysed Baxter&#x27;s figures using census returns and other statistics to determine how Disraeli&#x27;s planned extension of the franchise would affect subsequent elections. Cranborne found that Baxter had not taken into account the different types of boroughs in the totals of new voters. In small boroughs under 20,000 the &quot;fancy franchises&quot; for direct taxpayers and dual voters would be less than the new working-class voters in each seat.

The same day he met Carnarvon and they both studied the figures, coming to the same result each time: &quot;A complete revolution would be effected in the boroughs&quot; due to the new majority of the working-class electorate. Cranborne wanted to send his resignation to Derby along with the statistics but Cranborne agreed to Carnarvon&#x27;s suggestion that as a Cabinet member he had a right to call a Cabinet meeting. It was planned for the next day, 25 February. Cranborne wrote to Derby that he had discovered that Disraeli&#x27;s plan would &quot;throw the small boroughs almost, and many of them entirely, into the hands of the voter whose qualification is less than £10. I do not think that such a proceeding is for the interest of the country. I am sure that it is not in accordance with the hopes which those of us who took an active part in resisting Mr Gladstone&#x27;s Bill last year in those whom we induced to vote for us&quot;. The Conservative boroughs with populations less than 25,000 (a majority of the boroughs in Parliament) would be very much worse off under Disraeli&#x27;s scheme than the Liberal Reform Bill of the previous year: &quot;But if I assented to this scheme, now that I know what its effect will be, I could not look in the face those whom last year I urged to resist Mr Gladstone. I am convinced that it will, if passed, be the ruin of the Conservative party&quot;.

When Cranborne entered the Cabinet meeting on 25 February &quot;with reams of paper in his hands&quot; he began by reading statistics but was interrupted to be told of the proposal by Lord Stanley that they should agree to a £6 borough rating franchise instead of the full household suffrage, and a £20 county franchise rather than £50. The Cabinet agreed to Stanley&#x27;s proposal. The meeting was so contentious that a minister who was late initially thought they were debating the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. The next day another Cabinet meeting took place, with Cranborne saying little and the Cabinet adopting Disraeli&#x27;s proposal to bring in a Bill in a week&#x27;s time. On 28 February a meeting of the Carlton Club took place, with a majority of the 150 Conservative MPs present supporting Derby and Disraeli. At the Cabinet meeting on 2 March, Cranborne, Carnarvon and General Peel were pleaded with for two hours not to resign, but when Cranborne &quot;announced his intention of resigning...Peel and Carnarvon, with evident reluctance, followed his example&quot;. Lord John Manners observed that Cranborne &quot;remained unmoveable&quot;. Derby closed his red box with a sigh and stood up, saying &quot;The Party is ruined!&quot; Cranborne got up at the same time, with Peel remarking: &quot;Lord Cranborne, do you hear what Lord Derby says?&quot; Cranborne ignored this and the three resigning ministers left the room. Cranborne&#x27;s resignation speech was met with loud cheers and Carnarvon observed that it was &quot;moderate and in good taste – a sufficient justification for us who seceded and yet no disclosure of the frequent changes in policy in the Cabinet&quot;.

Disraeli introduced his Bill on 18 March and it would extend the suffrage to all rate-paying householders of two years&#x27; residence, dual voting for graduates or those of a learned profession, or those with £50 in government funds or in the Bank of England or a savings bank. These &quot;fancy franchises&quot;, as Cranborne had foreseen, did not survive the Bill&#x27;s course through Parliament; dual voting was dropped in March, the compound householder vote in April; and the residential qualification was reduced in May. In the end the county franchise was granted to householders rated at £12 annually. On 15 July the third reading of the Bill took place and Cranborne spoke first, in a speech which his biographer Andrew Roberts has called &quot;possibly the greatest oration of a career full of powerful parliamentary speeches&quot;. Cranborne observed how the Bill &quot;bristled with precautions, guarantees and securities&quot; had been stripped of these. He attacked Disraeli by pointing out how he had campaigned against the Liberal Bill in 1866 yet the next year introduced a Bill more extensive than the one rejected. In the peroration, Cranborne said:

In his article for the October &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, entitled &#x27;The Conservative Surrender&#x27;, Cranborne criticised Derby because he had &quot;obtained the votes which placed him in office on the faith of opinions which, to keep office, he immediately repudiated...He made up his mind to desert these opinions at the very moment he was being raised to power as their champion&quot;. Also, the annals of modern parliamentary history could find no parallel for Disraeli&#x27;s betrayal; historians would have to look &quot;to the days when Sunderland directed the Council, and accepted the favours of James when he was negotiating the invasion of William&quot;. Disraeli responded in a speech that Cranborne was &quot;a very clever man who has made a very great mistake&quot;.

==In opposition: 1868–1874==
In 1868, on the death of his father, he inherited the Marquessate of Salisbury, thereby becoming a member of the House of Lords. In addition to the titles, he inherited 20,000 acres with 13,000 of these in Hertfordshire. In 1869 he was elected Chancellor of the University of Oxford and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Between 1868 and 1871, he was chairman of the Great Eastern Railway, which was then experiencing losses. During his tenure, the company was taken out of Chancery, and paid out a small dividend on its ordinary shares.

From 1868 he was Honorary Colonel of the Hertfordshire Militia, which became the 4th (Militia) Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment, in 1881, and which was commanded in South Africa during the Second Boer War by his eldest son.

==Secretary of State for India: 1874–1878==
Salisbury returned to government in 1874, serving once again as Secretary of State for India in the government of Benjamin Disraeli, and Britain&#x27;s Ambassador Plenipotentiary at the 1876 Constantinople Conference. Salisbury gradually developed a good relationship with Disraeli, whom he had previously disliked and mistrusted.

During a Cabinet meeting on 7 March 1878, a discussion arose over whether to occupy Mytilene. Lord Derby recorded in his diary that &quot;[o]f all present Salisbury by far the most eager for action: he talked of our sliding into a position of contempt: of our being humiliated etc.&quot; At the Cabinet meeting the next day, Derby recorded that Lord John Manners objected to occupying the city &quot;on the ground of right. Salisbury treated scruples of this kind with marked contempt, saying, truly enough, that if our ancestors had cared for the rights of other people, the British empire would not have been made. He was more vehement than any one for going on. In the end the project was dropped...&quot;

==Foreign Secretary: 1878–1880==
In 1878, Salisbury became foreign secretary in time to help lead Britain to &quot;peace with honour&quot; at the Congress of Berlin. For this, he was rewarded with the Order of the Garter along with Disraeli.

==Leader of the Opposition: 1881–1885==
Following Disraeli&#x27;s death in 1881, the Conservatives entered a period of turmoil. The party&#x27;s previous leaders had all been appointed as prime minister by the reigning monarch on advice from their retiring predecessor, and no process was in place to deal with leadership succession in case either the leadership became vacant while the party was in opposition, or the outgoing leader died without designating a successor, situations which both arose from the death of Disraeli (a formal leadership election system would not be adopted by the party until 1964, shortly after the government of Alec Douglas-Home fell). Salisbury became the leader of the Conservative members of the House of Lords, though the overall leadership of the party was not formally allocated. So he struggled with the Commons leader Sir Stafford Northcote, a struggle in which Salisbury eventually emerged as the leading figure. Historian Richard Shannon argues that while Salisbury presided over one of the longest periods of Tory dominance, he misinterpreted and mishandled his election successes. Salisbury&#x27;s blindness to the middle class and reliance on the aristocracy prevented the Conservatives from becoming a majority party. 
===Reform Act 1884===
In 1884 Gladstone introduced a Reform Bill which would extend the suffrage to two million rural workers. Salisbury and Northcote agreed that any Reform Bill would be supported only if a parallel redistributionary measure was introduced as well. In a speech in the Lords, Salisbury claimed: &quot;Now that the people have in no real sense been consulted, when they had, at the last General Election, no notion of what was coming upon them, I feel that we are bound, as guardians of their interests, to call upon the government to appeal to the people, and by the result of that appeal we will abide&quot;. The Lords rejected the Bill and Parliament was prorogued for ten weeks. Writing to Canon Malcolm MacColl, Salisbury believed that Gladstone&#x27;s proposals for reform without redistribution would mean &quot;the absolute effacement of the Conservative Party. It would not have reappeared as a political force for thirty years. This conviction...greatly simplified for me the computation of risks&quot;. At a meeting of the Carlton Club on 15 July, Salisbury announced his plan for making the government introduce a Seats (or Redistribution) Bill in the Commons whilst at the same time delaying a Franchise Bill in the Lords. The unspoken implication being that Salisbury would relinquish the party leadership if his plan was not supported. Although there was some dissent, Salisbury carried the party with him.

Salisbury wrote to Lady John Manners on 14 June that he did not regard female suffrage as a question of high importance &quot;but when I am told that my ploughmen are capable citizens, it seems to me ridiculous to say that educated women are not just as capable. A good deal of the political battle of the future will be a conflict between religion and unbelief: &amp; the women will in that controversy be on the right side&quot;.

On 21 July, a large meeting for reform was held at Hyde Park. Salisbury said in &quot;The Times&quot; that &quot;the employment of mobs as an instrument of public policy is likely to prove a sinister precedent&quot;. On 23 July at Sheffield, Salisbury said that the government &quot;imagine that thirty thousand Radicals going to amuse themselves in London on a given day expresses the public opinion of the day...they appeal to the streets, they attempt legislation by picnic&quot;. Salisbury further claimed that Gladstone adopted reform as a &quot;cry&quot; to deflect attention from his foreign and economic policies at the next election. He claimed that the House of Lords was protecting the British constitution: &quot;I do not care whether it is an hereditary chamber or any other – to see that the representative chamber does not alter the tenure of its own power so as to give a perpetual lease of that power to the party in predominance at the moment&quot;.

On 25 July at a reform meeting in Leicester consisting of 40,000 people, Salisbury was burnt in effigy and a banner quoted Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI&quot;: &quot;Old Salisbury – shame to thy silver hair, Thou mad misleader&quot;. On 9 August in Manchester, over 100,000 came to hear Salisbury speak. On 30 September at Glasgow, he said: &quot;We wish that the franchise should pass but that before you make new voters you should determine the constitution in which they are to vote&quot;. Salisbury published an article in the &quot;National Review&quot; for October, titled &#x27;The Value of Redistribution: A Note on Electoral Statistics&#x27;. He claimed that the Conservatives &quot;have no cause, for Party reasons, to dread enfranchisement coupled with a fair redistribution&quot;. Judging by the 1880 results, Salisbury asserted that the overall loss to the Conservatives of enfranchisement without redistribution would be 47 seats. Salisbury spoke throughout Scotland and claimed that the government had no mandate for reform when it had not appealed to the people.

Gladstone offered wavering Conservatives a compromise a little short of enfranchisement and redistribution, and after the Queen unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Salisbury to compromise, he wrote to Rev. James Baker on 30 October: &quot;Politics stand alone among human pursuits in this characteristic, that no one is conscious of liking them – and no one is able to leave them. But whatever affection they may have had they are rapidly losing. The difference between now and thirty years ago when I entered the House of Commons is inconceivable&quot;.

On 11 November, the Franchise Bill received its third reading in the Commons and it was due to get a second reading in the Lords. The day after at a meeting of Conservative leaders, Salisbury was outnumbered in his opposition to compromise. On 13 February, Salisbury rejected MacColl&#x27;s idea that he should meet Gladstone, as he believed the meeting would be found out and that Gladstone had no genuine desire to negotiate. On 17 November, it was reported in the newspapers that if the Conservatives gave &quot;adequate assurance&quot; that the Franchise Bill would pass the Lords before Christmas the government would ensure that a parallel Seats Bill would receive its second reading in the Commons as the Franchise Bill went into committee stage in the Lords. Salisbury responded by agreeing only if the Franchise Bill came second. The Carlton Club met to discuss the situation, with Salisbury&#x27;s daughter writing:

Despite the controversy which had raged, the meetings of leading Liberals and Conservatives on reform at Downing Street were amicable. Salisbury and the Liberal Sir Charles Dilke dominated discussions as they had both closely studied in detail the effects of reform on the constituencies. After one of the last meetings on 26 November, Gladstone told his secretary that &quot;Lord Salisbury, who seems to monopolise all the say on his side, has no respect for tradition. As compared with him, Mr Gladstone declares he is himself quite a Conservative. They got rid of the boundary question, minority representation, grouping and the Irish difficulty. The question was reduced to... for or against single member constituencies&quot;. The Reform Bill laid down that the majority of the 670 constituencies were to be roughly equal in size and return one member; those between 50,000 and 165,000 kept the two-member representation and those over 165,000 and all the counties were split up into single-member constituencies. This franchise existed until 1918.

==Prime minister: 1885–1892==
=== First term: 1885–1886 ===
==== Appointment ====

Salisbury became prime minister of a minority administration from 1885 to 1886. In the November 1883 issue of &quot;National Review&quot; Salisbury wrote an article titled &quot;Labourers&#x27; and Artisans&#x27; Dwellings&quot; in which he argued that the poor conditions of working-class housing were injurious to morality and health. Salisbury said &quot;&quot;Laissez-faire&quot; is an admirable doctrine but it must be applied on both sides&quot;, as Parliament had enacted new building projects (such as the Thames Embankment) which had displaced working-class people and was responsible for &quot;packing the people tighter&quot;: &quot;...thousands of families have only a single room to dwell in, where they sleep and eat, multiply, and die... It is difficult to exaggerate the misery which such conditions of life must cause, or the impulse they must give to vice. The depression of body and mind which they create is an almost insuperable obstacle to the action of any elevating or refining agencies&quot;. The &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; argued that Salisbury had sailed into &quot;the turbid waters of State Socialism&quot;; the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; said his article was &quot;State socialism pure and simple&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; claimed Salisbury was &quot;in favour of state socialism&quot;.

==== Early reforms and parliamentary majority ====
In July 1885 the Housing of the Working Classes Bill was introduced by the Home Secretary, R. A. Cross in the Commons and Salisbury in the Lords. When Lord Wemyss criticised the Bill as &quot;strangling the spirit of independence and the self-reliance of the people, and destroying the moral fibre of our race in the anaconda coils of state socialism&quot;, Salisbury responded: &quot;Do not imagine that by merely affixing to it the reproach of Socialism you can seriously affect the progress of any great legislative movement, or destroy those high arguments which are derived from the noblest principles of philanthropy and religion&quot;. The Bill ultimately passed and came into effect on 14 August 1885.

Although unable to accomplish much due to his lack of a parliamentary majority, the split of the Liberals over Irish Home Rule in 1886 enabled him to return to power with a majority, and, excepting a Liberal minority government (1892–95), to serve as prime minister from 1886 to 1902.

===Second term: 1886–1892===
Salisbury was back in office, although without a conservative majority; he depended on the Liberal Unionists, led by Lord Hartington. Maintaining the alliance forced Salisbury to make concessions in support of progressive legislation regarding Irish land purchases, education, and county councils. His nephew Arthur Balfour acquired a strong reputation for resolute coercion in Ireland, and was promoted to leadership in the Commons in 1891. The Prime Minister proved adept at his handling of the press, as Sir Edward Walter Hamilton noted in his diary in 1887 he was: &quot;the prime minister most accessible to the press. He is not prone to give information: but when he does, he gives it freely, &amp; his information can always be relied on.&quot;

====Foreign policy====
Salisbury once again kept the foreign office (from January 1887), and his diplomacy continued to display a high level of skill, avoiding the extremes of Gladstone on the left and Disraeli on the right. His policy rejected entangling alliances–which at the time and ever since has been called &quot;splendid isolation&quot;. He was successful in negotiating differences over colonial claims with France and others. The major problems were in the Mediterranean, where British interests had been involved for a century. It was now especially important to protect the Suez Canal and the sea lanes to India and Asia. He ended Britain&#x27;s isolation through the Mediterranean Agreements (March and December 1887) with Italy and Austria-Hungary. He saw the need for maintaining control of the seas and passed the Naval Defence Act 1889, which facilitated the spending of an extra £20 million on the Royal Navy over the following four years. This was the biggest ever expansion of the navy in peacetime: ten new battleships, thirty-eight new cruisers, eighteen new torpedo boats and four new fast gunboats. Traditionally (since the Battle of Trafalgar) Britain had possessed a navy one-third larger than their nearest naval rival but now the Royal Navy was set to the two-power standard; that it would be maintained &quot;to a standard of strength equivalent to that of the combined forces of the next two biggest navies in the world&quot;. This was aimed at France and Russia.

Salisbury was offered a dukedom by Queen Victoria in 1886 and 1892, but declined both offers, citing the prohibitive cost of the lifestyle dukes were expected to maintain and stating that he would rather have an ancient marquessate than a modern dukedom.

=====1890 Ultimatum on Portugal=====

Trouble arose with Portugal, which had overextended itself in building a colonial empire in Africa it could ill afford. There was a clash of colonial visions between Portugal (the &quot;Pink Map&quot;, produced by the Lisbon Geographic Society after Alexandre de Serpa Pinto&#x27;s, Hermenegildo Capelo&#x27;s and Roberto Ivens&#x27;s expeditions to Africa) and the British Empire (Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s &quot;Cape to Cairo Railway&quot;) which came after years of diplomatic conflict about several African territories with Portugal and other powers. Portugal, financially hard-pressed, had to abandon several territories corresponding to today&#x27;s Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe in favour of the Empire.

====Domestic policy====
In 1889 Salisbury set up the London County Council and then in 1890 allowed it to build houses. However, he came to regret this, saying in November 1894 that the LCC, &quot;is the place where collectivist and socialistic experiments are tried. It is the place where a new revolutionary spirit finds its instruments and collects its arms&quot;.

=====Controversies=====
Salisbury caused controversy in 1888 after Gainsford Bruce had won the Holborn by-election for the Unionists, beating the Liberal Lord Compton. Bruce had won the seat with a smaller majority than Francis Duncan had for the Unionists in 1885. Salisbury explained this by saying in a speech in Edinburgh on 30 November: &quot;But then Colonel Duncan was opposed to a black man, and, however great the progress of mankind has been, and however far we have advanced in overcoming prejudices, I doubt if we have yet got to the point where a British constituency will elect a black man to represent them... I am speaking roughly and using language in its colloquial sense, because I imagine the colour is not exactly black, but at all events, he was a man of another race.&quot;

The &quot;black man&quot; was Dadabhai Naoroji, an Indian Parsi. Salisbury&#x27;s comments were criticised by the Queen and by Liberals who believed that Salisbury had suggested that only white Britons could represent a British constituency. Three weeks later, Salisbury delivered a speech at Scarborough, where he denied that &quot;the word &quot;black&quot; necessarily implies any contemptuous denunciation: &quot;Such a doctrine seems to be a scathing insult to a very large proportion of the human race... The people whom we have been fighting at Suakin, and whom we have happily conquered, are among the finest tribes in the world, and many of them are as black as my hat&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;such candidatures are incongruous and unwise. The British House of Commons, with its traditions... is a machine too peculiar and too delicate to be managed by any but those who have been born within these isles&quot;. Naoroji was elected for Finsbury in 1892 and Salisbury invited him to become a Governor of the Imperial Institute, which he accepted. In 1888, the New York Times published an article that was extremely critical of Lord Salisbury&#x27;s remark. It included the following quotation, &quot;Of course the parsees are not black men, but the purest Aryan type in existence, with an average complexion fairer than Lord Salisbury&#x27;s; but even if they were ebony hued it would be grotesque and foolish for a Prime Minister of England to insult them in such a wanton fashion as this.&quot;

Documents in the Foreign Office archives revealed that Salisbury was made aware of a rape in 1891 and other atrocities carried out against women and children in the Niger Delta by Consul George Annesley and his soldiers but took no action against Annesley, who was &quot;quietly pensioned off.&quot;

==Leader of the Opposition: 1892–1895==
In the aftermath of the general election of 1892, Balfour and Chamberlain wished to pursue a programme of social reform, which Salisbury believed would alienate &quot;a good many people who have always been with us&quot; and that &quot;these social questions are destined to break up our party&quot;. When the Liberals and Irish Nationalists (which were a majority in the new Parliament) successfully voted against the government, Salisbury resigned the premiership on 12 August. His private secretary at the Foreign Office wrote that Salisbury &quot;shewed indecent joy at his release&quot;.

Salisbury—in an article in November for the &quot;National Review&quot; entitled &#x27;Constitutional revision&#x27;—said that the new government, lacking a majority in England and Scotland, had no mandate for Home Rule and argued that because there was no referendum only the House of Lords could provide the necessary consultation with the nation on policies for organic change. The Lords defeated the second Home Rule Bill by 419 to 41 in September 1893, but Salisbury stopped them from opposing the Liberal Chancellor&#x27;s death duties in 1894. In 1894 Salisbury also became president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, presenting a notable inaugural address on 4 August of that year. The general election of 1895 returned a large Unionist majority.

==Prime minister: 1895–1902==
Salisbury&#x27;s expertise was in foreign affairs. For most of his time as prime minister, he served not as First Lord of the Treasury, the traditional position held by the prime minister, but as foreign secretary. In that capacity, he managed Britain&#x27;s foreign affairs, but he was being sarcastic about a policy of &quot;Splendid isolation&quot;—such was not his goal.

===Foreign policy===
In foreign affairs, Salisbury was challenged worldwide. The long-standing policy of &quot;Splendid isolation&quot; had left Britain with no allies and few friends. In Europe, Germany was worrisome regarding its growing industrial and naval power, Kaiser Wilhelm&#x27;s erratic foreign policy, and the instability caused by the decline of the Ottoman Empire. France was threatening British control of Sudan. In the Americas, for domestic political reasons, U.S. President Grover Cleveland manufactured a quarrel over Venezuela&#x27;s border with British Guiana. In South Africa conflict was threatening with the two Boer republics. In the Great Game in Central Asia, the line that separated Russia and British India in 1800 was narrowing. In China the British economic dominance was threatened by other powers that wanted to control slices of China. 
The tension with Germany had subsided in 1890 after a deal exchanged German holdings in East Africa for an island off the German coast. However, with peace-minded Bismarck retired by an aggressive new Kaiser, tensions rose and negotiations faltered. France retreated in Africa after the British dominated in the Fashoda Incident. The Venezuela crisis was settled amicably and London and Washington became friendly after Salisbury gave Washington what it wanted in the Alaska boundary dispute. The Open Door Policy and a 1902 treaty with Japan resolved the China crisis. However, in South Africa a nasty Boer war broke out in 1899 and for a few months it seemed the Boers were winning.

====Venezuela crisis with the United States====
In 1895 the Venezuelan crisis with the United States erupted. A border dispute between the colony of British Guiana and Venezuela caused a major Anglo-American crisis when the United States intervened to take Venezuela&#x27;s side. Propaganda sponsored by Venezuela convinced American public opinion that the British were infringing on Venezuelan territory. The United States demanded an explanation and Salisbury refused. The crisis escalated when President Cleveland, citing the Monroe Doctrine, issued an ultimatum in late 1895. Salisbury&#x27;s cabinet convinced him he had to go to arbitration. Both sides calmed down and the issue was quickly resolved through arbitration which largely upheld the British position on the legal boundary line. Salisbury remained angry but a consensus was reached in London, led by Lord Landsdowne, to seek much friendlier relations with the United States. By standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of the British, the US improved relations with the Latin Americans, and the cordial manner of the procedure improved American diplomatic relations with Britain. Despite the popularity of the Boers in American public opinion, official Washington supported London in the Second Boer War.

==== Africa====
An Anglo-German agreement (1890) resolved conflicting claims in East Africa; Great Britain received large territories in Zanzibar and Uganda in exchange for the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea. Negotiations with Germany on broader issues failed. In January 1896 German Kaiser Wilhelm II escalated tensions in South Africa with his Kruger telegram congratulating Boer President Paul Kruger of the Transvaal for beating off the British Jameson Raid. German officials in Berlin had managed to stop the Kaiser from proposing a German protectorate over the Transvaal. The telegram backfired, as the British began to see Germany as a major threat. The British moved their forces from Egypt south into Sudan in 1898, securing complete control of that troublesome region. However, a strong British force unexpectedly confronted a small French military expedition at Fashoda. Salisbury quickly resolved the tensions, and systematically moved toward friendlier relations with France.

====Second Boer War====

After gold was discovered in the South African Republic (called Transvaal) in the 1880s, thousands of British men flocked to the gold mines. Transvaal and its sister republic the Orange Free State were small, rural, independent nations founded by Afrikaners, who descended from Dutch immigrants to the area before 1800. The newly arrived miners were needed for their labour and business operations but were distrusted by the Afrikaners, who called them &quot;uitlanders&quot;. The uitlanders heavily outnumbered the Boers in cities and mining districts; they had to pay heavy taxes, and had limited civil rights and no right to vote. The British, jealous of the gold and diamond mines and highly protective of its people, demanded reforms, which were rejected. A small-scale private British effort to overthrow Transvaal&#x27;s President Paul Kruger, the Jameson Raid of 1895, was a fiasco and presaged full-scale conflict as all diplomatic efforts failed.

War started on 11 October 1899 and ended on 31 May 1902 as Great Britain faced the two small far-away Boer nations. The Prime Minister let his extremely energetic colonial minister Joseph Chamberlain take charge of the war. British efforts were based from its Cape Colony and the Colony of Natal. There were some native African allies, but generally, both sides avoided using black soldiers. The British war effort was further supported by volunteers from across the Empire. All other nations were neutral, but public opinion in them was largely hostile to Britain. Inside Britain and its Empire there also was a significant opposition to the Second Boer War because of the atrocities and military failures.

The British were overconfident and underprepared. Chamberlain and other top London officials ignored the repeated warnings of military advisors that the Boers were well prepared, well armed, and fighting for their homes in a very difficult terrain. The Boers with about 33,000 soldiers, against 13,000 front-line British troops, struck first, besieging Ladysmith, Kimberly, and Mafeking, and winning important battles at Colenso, Magersfontein and Stormberg in late 1899. Staggered, the British fought back, relieved its besieged cities, and prepared to invade first the Orange Free State, and then Transvaal in late 1900. The Boers refused to surrender or negotiate and reverted to guerrilla warfare. After two years of hard fighting, Britain, using over 400,000 soldiers systematically destroyed the resistance, raising worldwide complaints about brutality. The Boers were fighting for their homes and families, who provided them with food and hiding places. The British solution was to forcefully relocate all the Boer civilians into heavily guarded concentration camps, where 28,000 died of disease. Then it systematically blocked off and tracked down the highly mobile Boer combat units. The battles were small operations; most of the 22,000 British dead were victims of disease. The war cost £217 million and demonstrated the Army urgently needed reforms but it ended in victory for the British and the Conservatives won the Khaki election of 1900. The Boers were given generous terms, and both former republics were incorporated into the Union of South Africa in 1910.

The war had many vehement critics, predominantly in the Liberal Party. However, on the whole, the war was well received by the British public, which staged numerous public demonstrations and parades of support. Soon there were memorials built across Britain. Strong public demand for news coverage meant that the war was well covered by journalists – including young Winston Churchill – and photographers, as well as letter-writers and poets. General Sir Redvers Buller imposed strict censorship and had no friends in the media, who wrote him up as a blundering buffoon. In dramatic contrast, Field Marshal Frederick Roberts pampered the press, which responded by making him a national hero.

====German naval issues====
In 1897 Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz became German Naval Secretary of State and began the transformation of the Imperial German Navy from a small, coastal defence force to a fleet meant to challenge British naval power. Tirpitz called for a &quot;Risikoflotte&quot; or &quot;risk fleet&quot; that would make it too risky for Britain to take on Germany as part of a wider bid to alter the international balance of power decisively in Germany&#x27;s favour. At the same time German foreign minister Bernhard von Bülow called for &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; (world politics). It was the new policy of Germany to assert its claim to be a global power. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s policy of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; (realistic politics) was abandoned as Germany was intent on challenging and upsetting international order. The long-run result was the inability of Britain and Germany to be friends or to form an alliance.

Britain reacted to Germany&#x27;s accelerated naval arms race with major innovations, especially those developed by Admiral Fisher. The most important development was unveiled – after Salisbury&#x27;s death – the entry of into service in 1906, which rendered all the world&#x27;s battleships obsolete and set back German plans.

Historians agree that Salisbury was a strong and effective leader in foreign affairs. He had a superb grasp of the issues, and was never a &quot;splendid isolationist&quot; but rather, says Nancy W. Ellenberger, was:

===Domestic policy===
At home he sought to &quot;kill Home Rule with kindness&quot; by launching a land reform programme which helped hundreds of thousands of Irish peasants gain land ownership and largely ended complaints against English landlords. The Elementary School Teachers (Superannuation) Act of 1898 enabled teachers to secure an annuity via the payment of voluntary contributions. The Elementary Education (Defective and Epileptic Children) Act of 1899 permitted school boards to provide for the education of mentally and physically defective and epileptic children.

===Honours and retirement===

In 1895 and 1900 he was honoured with appointments as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and High Steward of the City and Liberty of Westminster, which he held for life.

On 11 July 1902, in failing health and broken-hearted over the death of his wife, Salisbury resigned. He was succeeded by his nephew, Arthur Balfour. King Edward VII conferred upon him the Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO), with the order star set in brilliants, during his resignation audience.

==Last year: 1902–1903==
Due to breathing difficulties caused by his great weight, Salisbury took to sleeping in a chair at Hatfield House. He also experienced a heart condition and later blood poisoning caused by an ulcerated leg. His death in August 1903 followed a fall from that chair.

Salisbury was buried at St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church, Hatfield, where his predecessor as prime minister, Lord Melbourne, is also interred. Salisbury is commemorated with a monumental cenotaph near the west door of Westminster Abbey.

When Salisbury died his estate was valued at £310,336, (equivalent to £ in ).

==Legacy==


Many historians portray Salisbury as a principled statesman of traditional, aristocratic conservatism: a prime minister who promoted cautious imperialism and resisted sweeping parliamentary and franchise reforms. Robert Blake considers Salisbury &quot;a great foreign minister, [but] essentially negative, indeed reactionary in home affairs&quot;. Professor P.T. Marsh&#x27;s estimate is more favourable than Blake&#x27;s; he portrays Salisbury as a leader who &quot;held back the popular tide for twenty years.&quot; Professor Paul Smith argues that, &quot;into the &#x27;progressive&#x27; strain of modern Conservatism he simply will not fit.&quot; H.C.G. Matthew points to &quot;the narrow cynicism of Salisbury.&quot; One admirer, conservative historian Maurice Cowling, largely agrees with the critics and says Salisbury found the democracy born of the 1867 and 1884 Reform Acts as &quot;perhaps less objectionable than he had expected—succeeding, through his public persona, in mitigating some part of its nastiness.&quot; Historian Peter T. Marsh states: &quot;In the field of foreign affairs, where he was happiest and most successful, he kept his own counsel and eschewed broad principles of conduct, preferring close-eyed realism and reliability of conduct.&quot;

Considerable attention has been devoted to his writings and ideas. The Conservative historian Robert Blake considered Salisbury &quot;the most formidable intellectual figure that the Conservative party has ever produced&quot;. In 1977 the Salisbury Group was founded, chaired by Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury and named after the 3rd Marquess. It published pamphlets advocating conservative policies. The academic quarterly &quot;The Salisbury Review&quot; was named in his honour (by Michael Oakeshott) upon its founding in 1982. Cowling claimed that &quot;The giant of conservative doctrine is Salisbury&quot;. It was on Cowling&#x27;s suggestion that Paul Smith edited a collection of Salisbury&#x27;s articles from the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. Andrew Jones and Michael Bentley wrote in 1978 that &quot;historical inattention&quot; to Salisbury &quot;involves wilful dismissal of a Conservative tradition which recognizes that threat to humanity when ruling authorities engage in democratic flattery and the threat to liberty in a competitive rush of legislation&quot;.

In 1967, Clement Attlee (Labour Party prime minister, 1945–51) was asked who he thought was the best prime minister of his lifetime. Attlee immediately replied: &quot;Salisbury&quot;.

The 6th Marquess of Salisbury commissioned Andrew Roberts to write Salisbury&#x27;s authorised biography, which was published in 1999.

After the Bering Sea Arbitration, Canadian Prime Minister Sir John Sparrow David Thompson said of Lord Salisbury&#x27;s acceptance of the Arbitration Treaty that it was &quot;one of the worst acts of what I regard as a very stupid and worthless life&quot;.

The British phrase &#x27;Bob&#x27;s your uncle&#x27; is thought to have derived from Robert Cecil&#x27;s appointment of his nephew, Arthur Balfour, as Chief Secretary for Ireland.

Fort Salisbury (now Harare) was named in honour of him when it was founded in September 1890. Subsequently, simply known as Salisbury, the city became the capital of Southern Rhodesia, from 1890, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland from 1953 to 1963, Rhodesia from 1963 to 1979, Zimbabwe Rhodesia, in 1979, and finally Zimbabwe, from 1980. The name was changed to Harare by the Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe in April 1982, on the second anniversary of Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence. Cecil Square, near to Parliament, was also named after him and not, as is erroneously but popularly thought, after Cecil Rhodes. Other Rhodesian/Zimbabwean connections include the suburbs of Hatfield, Cranborne and New Sarum.

To date he is the only British prime minister to sport a full beard. At tall, he was also the tallest prime minister.

==Family and personal life==
Lord Salisbury&#x27;s father, James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury, a minor Conservative politician, wanted him to marry a rich heiress to protect the family&#x27;s lands. In 1857, he defied his father and instead married Georgina Alderson, the daughter of Sir Edward Alderson, a moderately notable judge of lower social standing than the Cecils, outside the aristocracy or landed gentry. The marriage proved a happy one. Robert and Georgina had eight children, all but one of whom survived infancy. He was an indulgent father and made sure his children had a much better childhood than the one through which he suffered. Cut off from his family money, Robert supported his family through journalism and was later reconciled with his father.
