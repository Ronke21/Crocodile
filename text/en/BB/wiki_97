<text>In ecology, a biological interaction is the effect that a pair of organisms living together in a community have on each other. They can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions). These effects may be short-term, or long-term, both often strongly influence the adaptation and evolution of the species involved. Biological interactions range from mutualism, beneficial to both partners, to competition, harmful to both partners. Interactions can be direct when physical contact is established or indirect, through intermediaries such as shared resources, territories, ecological services, metabolic waste, toxins or growth inhibitors. This type of relationship can be shown by net effect based on individual effects on both organisms arising out of relationship.

Several recent studies have suggested non-trophic species interactions such as habitat modification and mutualisms can be important determinants of food web structures. However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across ecosystems, and whether non-trophic interactions affect food webs randomly, or affect specific trophic levels or functional groups.

==History==
Although biological interactions, more or less individually, were studied earlier, Edward Haskell (1949) gave an integrative approach to the thematic, proposing a classification of &quot;co-actions&quot;, later adopted by biologists as &quot;interactions&quot;. Close and long-term interactions are described as symbiosis; symbioses that are mutually beneficial are called mutualistic.

The term symbiosis was subject to a century-long debate about whether it should specifically denote mutualism, as in lichens or in parasites that benefit themselves. This debate created two different classifications for biotic interactions, one based on the time (long-term and short-term interactions), and other based on the magnitude of interaction force (competition/mutualism) or effect of individual fitness, according the stress gradient hypothesis and Mutualism Parasitism Continuum. Evolutionary game theory such as Red Queen Hypothesis, Red King Hypothesis or Black Queen Hypothesis, have demonstrated a classification based on the force of interaction is important.

== Classification based on time of interaction ==

=== Short-term interactions ===

Short-term interactions, including predation and pollination, are extremely important in ecology and evolution. These are short-lived in terms of the duration of a single interaction: a predator kills and eats a prey; a pollinator transfers pollen from one flower to another; but they are extremely durable in terms of their influence on the evolution of both partners. As a result, the partners coevolve.

==== Predation ====

In predation, one organism, the predator, kills and eats another organism, its prey. Predators are adapted and often highly specialized for hunting, with acute senses such as vision, hearing, or smell. Many predatory animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, have sharp claws or jaws to grip, kill, and cut up their prey. Other adaptations include stealth and aggressive mimicry that improve hunting efficiency. Predation has a powerful selective effect on prey, causing them to develop antipredator adaptations such as warning coloration, alarm calls and other signals, camouflage and defensive spines and chemicals. Predation has been a major driver of evolution since at least the Cambrian period.

==== Pollination ====
In pollination, pollinators including insects (entomophily), some birds (ornithophily), and some bats, transfer pollen from a male flower part to a female flower part, enabling fertilisation, in return for a reward of pollen or nectar. The partners have coevolved through geological time; in the case of insects and flowering plants, the coevolution has continued for over 100 million years. Insect-pollinated flowers are adapted with shaped structures, bright colours, patterns, scent, nectar, and sticky pollen to attract insects, guide them to pick up and deposit pollen, and reward them for the service. Pollinator insects like bees are adapted to detect flowers by colour, pattern, and scent, to collect and transport pollen (such as with bristles shaped to form pollen baskets on their hind legs), and to collect and process nectar (in the case of honey bees, making and storing honey). The adaptations on each side of the interaction match the adaptations on the other side, and have been shaped by natural selection on their effectiveness of pollination.

==== Seed dispersal ====

Seed dispersal is the movement, spread or transport of seeds away from the parent plant. Plants have limited mobility and rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic vectors such as the wind and living (biotic) vectors like birds. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. The patterns of seed dispersal are determined in large part by the dispersal mechanism and this has important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant populations, as well as migration patterns and species interactions. There are five main modes of seed dispersal: gravity, wind, ballistic, water, and by animals. Some plants are serotinous and only disperse their seeds in response to an environmental stimulus. Dispersal involves the letting go or detachment of a diaspore from the main parent plant.

=== Long-term interactions (symbioses) ===

The six possible types of symbiosis are mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, neutralism, amensalism, and competition. These are distinguished by the degree of benefit or harm they cause to each partner.

==== Mutualism ====

Mutualism is an interaction between two or more species, where species derive a mutual benefit, for example an increased carrying capacity. Similar interactions within a species are known as co-operation. Mutualism may be classified in terms of the closeness of association, the closest being symbiosis, which is often confused with mutualism. One or both species involved in the interaction may be , meaning they cannot survive in the short or long term without the other species. Though mutualism has historically received less attention than other interactions such as predation, it is an important subject in ecology. Examples include cleaning symbiosis, gut flora, Müllerian mimicry, and nitrogen fixation by bacteria in the root nodules of legumes.

==== Commensalism ====

Commensalism benefits one organism and the other organism is neither benefited nor harmed. It occurs when one organism takes benefits by interacting with another organism by which the host organism is not affected. A good example is a remora living with a manatee. Remoras feed on the manatee&#x27;s faeces. The manatee is not affected by this interaction, as the remora does not deplete the manatee&#x27;s resources.

==== Parasitism ====

Parasitism is a relationship between species, where one organism, the parasite, lives on or in another organism, the host, causing it some harm, and is adapted structurally to this way of life. The parasite either feeds on the host, or, in the case of intestinal parasites, consumes some of its food.

==== Neutralism ====

Neutralism (a term introduced by Eugene Odum) describes the relationship between two species that interact but do not affect each other. Examples of true neutralism are virtually impossible to prove; the term is in practice used to describe situations where interactions are negligible or insignificant.

==== Amensalism ====

Amensalism (a term introduced by Edward Haskell) is an interaction where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by itself. Amensalism describes the adverse effect that one organism has on another organism (figure 32.1). This is a unidirectional process based on the release of a specific compound by one organism that has a negative effect on another. A classic example of amensalism is the microbial production of antibiotics that can inhibit or kill other, susceptible microorganisms.

A clear case of amensalism is where sheep or cattle trample grass. Whilst the presence of the grass causes negligible detrimental effects to the animal&#x27;s hoof, the grass suffers from being crushed. Amensalism is often used to describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions, such as has been observed between the Spanish ibex and weevils of the genus &quot;Timarcha&quot; which feed upon the same type of shrub. Whilst the presence of the weevil has almost no influence on food availability, the presence of ibex has an enormous detrimental effect on weevil numbers, as they consume significant quantities of plant matter and incidentally ingest the weevils upon it.

==== Competition ====

Competition can be defined as an interaction between organisms or species, in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another. Competition is often for a resource such as food, water, or territory in limited supply, or for access to females for reproduction. Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition. According to the competitive exclusion principle, species less suited to compete for resources should either adapt or die out. This competition within and between species for resources plays a critical role in natural selection.

== Classification based on effect on fitness ==

Biotic interactions can vary in intensity (strength of interaction), and frequency (number of interactions in a given time). There are direct interactions when there is a physical contact between individuals or indirect interactions when there is no physical contact, that is, the interaction occurs with a resource, ecological service, toxine or growth inhibitor. The interactions can be directly determined by individuals (incidentally) or by stochastic processes (accidentally), for instance side effects that one individual have on other. They are divided into six major types: Competition, Antagonism, Amensalism, Neutralism, Commensalism and Mutualism.

==Non-trophic interactions==

Some examples of non-trophic interactions are habitat modification, mutualism and competition for space. It has been suggested recently that non-trophic interactions can indirectly affect food web topology and trophic dynamics by affecting the species in the network and the strength of trophic links. It is necessary to integrate trophic and non-trophic interactions in ecological network analyses. The few empirical studies that address this suggest food web structures (network topologies) can be strongly influenced by species interactions outside the trophic network. However these studies include only a limited number of coastal systems, and it remains unclear to what extent these findings can be generalized. Whether non-trophic interactions typically affect specific species, trophic levels, or functional groups within the food web, or, alternatively, indiscriminately mediate species and their trophic interactions throughout the network has yet to be resolved. sessile species with generally low trophic levels seem to benefit more than others from non-trophic facilitation, though facilitation benefits higher trophic and more mobile species as well.

<text>Data Resources Inc or DRI was co-founded in 1969 by Donald Marron and Otto Eckstein. Marron is best known as the former CEO of PaineWebber and founder of Lightyear Capital. Eckstein was a Harvard University economics professor, economic consultant to Lyndon Baines Johnson and member of the Council of Economic Advisors; he is best known for the development of the theory of core inflation. 

DRI became the largest non-governmental distributor of economic data in the world. The company also built the largest macroeconometric model of its era. Allen Sinai was a leading architect. Richard Hokenson did much of the maintenance work. 
DRI was a major customer of Burroughs Computer. During the 1970s era of rapid expansion, DRI used the Burroughs 6700 and 7700 mainframes. DRI also developed innovative software, including the PRIMA and AID database languages; EPL Econometric Programming Language; MODSIM for solving models; and MODEL for solving econometric models in particular. Later the functionality of all these programs was merged into the EPS Econometric Programming System by the chief architect of all this software, Robert P. Lacey. Other programmers in this effort included John Ahlstrom, Greg George, and Joe Polak. 
The DRI Review was published monthly and summarized what the models said for the economic outlook. This information was presented in outlook conferences. DRI also held educational seminars.

==General corporate timeline==
* 1979: Eckstein and Marron sold DRI to McGraw-Hill for over $100 million Joseph Kasputys was named president in 1981.
* 1984: After Eckstein&#x27;s death, DRI was slow to adopt new technology. DRI was wed to mainframe computers when the industry was moving this kind of analytic work to personal computers.
* 1987: Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA) merged with Chase Econometrics, a competitor to DRI and WEFA.
* 2001: DRI merged with WEFA to form Global Insight. 
* 2008: Global Insight was bought by IHS Inc., thus inheriting 50 years of experience and more than 200 full-time economists, country risk analysts, and consultants.

<text>Marcus Minucius Felix (died c. 250 AD in Rome) was one of the earliest of the Latin apologists for Christianity.

Nothing is known of his personal history, and even the date at which he wrote can be only approximately ascertained as between AD 150 and 270. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; No. 58 speaks of him as &quot;Romae insignis causidicus&quot; [one of Rome&#x27;s notable solicitors], but in that he is probably only improving on the expression of Lactantius who speaks of him as &quot;non-ignobilis inter causidicos loci&quot; [not unknown among solicitors].

== Octavius ==
He is now exclusively known by his &quot;Octavius&quot;, a dialogue on Christianity between the pagan Caecilius Natalis and the Christian Octavius Januarius. Written for educated non-Christians, the arguments are borrowed chiefly from Cicero, especially his &quot;De natura deorum&quot; (&quot;Concerning the Nature of the Gods&quot;), and Christian material, mainly from the Greek Apologists.

The &quot;Octavius&quot; is admittedly earlier than Cyprian&#x27;s &quot;Quod idola dei non-sint&quot;, which borrows from it; how much earlier can be determined only by settling the relation in which it stands to Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;Apologeticum&quot;.

The name Caecilius Natalis contains the nomen Caecilius and cognomen Natalis, which may refer to the gens Caecilia, a plebeian family at Rome.

The name Octavius Januarius contains the nomen Octavius and cognomen Januarius, which may refer to the gens Octavia – the family name of Emperor Augustus.

== Minucia Gens ==
The name of Marcus Minucius Felix indicates his association with the gens Minucia.

== Stoic Influence ==
Stoic influences can also be seen in his work.

<text>Hubert Ashton Holden (12 May 1822 – 1 December 1896) was an English classical scholar.

==Biography==
He was born in Birmingham into an old Staffordshire family. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s College, Birmingham, under Francis Jeune (afterwards bishop of Peterborough), and subsequently under James Prince Lee (afterwards bishop of Manchester).
He proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, and in his first year of residence, 1842, gained the first Bell university scholarship. 
He graduated B.A. in 1845, being senior classic, and junior optime in the mathematical tripos, and was fellow of Trinity College from 1847 to 1854; he was LL.D. in 1863.

In 1848, he was ordained deacon, and took priest&#x27;s orders in 1859. 
He discharged the duties of assistant tutor and classical lecturer of his college from 1848 until 1853, when he was appointed vice-principal of Cheltenham College, and continued in that post until 1858. 
From 1858 to 1883, he was headmaster of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School, Ipswich. In 1890, he was appointed by the crown to a fellowship of the university of London, in which he had been classical examiner from 1869 till 1874, and examiner in Greek from 1886 till 1890. In 1892 the degree of Litt.D. was conferred on him by Dublin University. He died on 1 Dec. 1896, at 20 Redcliffe Square, London, in his seventy-fifth year, and was buried on 5 December in the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

In addition to several school editions of portions of Cicero, Thucydides, Xenophon and Plutarch, he published an expurgated text of Aristophanes with a useful &quot;onomasticon&quot; (re-issued separately, 1902) and larger editions of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De officiis&quot; (revised ed., 1898) and of the &quot;Octavius&quot; of Minucius Felix (1853).

He married Letitia Lofft and was the father of Brig.-Gen. Sir Capel Lofft Holden.

==Works== 
Those by which he was best known are &#x27;Foliorum Silvula : Selections for Translation into Latin and Greek Verse, chiefly from the University and College Examination Papers,&#x27; Cambridge, 1852 (four parts : pt. i. 2nd ed. 1888 ; pt. ii. 4th ed. 1890 ; pt. iii. 3rd ed. 1864) ; &#x27;Foliorum Centuriæ,&#x27; 1852 (10th ed. 1888), a similar collection of pieces for translation into Latin and Greek prose, and &#x27;Folia Silvulæ, sive Eclogæ Poetarum Anglicorum in Latinum et Græcum conversæ&#x27; (Cambridge, vol. i. 1865 ; vol. ii. 1870), containing select translations, by various hands, of pieces from the preceding volumes. 
All these were edited for the syndics of the Cambridge University Press.

For the same body he edited Cicero&#x27;s &#x27;De Officiis&#x27; (1869 ; 6th ed. 1886 ; revised edition, 1898), and &#x27;Pro Gnteo Plancio Oratio ad Judices&#x27; (1881) ; Xenophon&#x27;s &#x27;Cyropædeia&#x27; (3 vols. 1887–90) ; Plutarch&#x27;s &#x27; Lives of the Gracchi&#x27; (1885), &#x27;Lucius Cornelius Sulla&#x27; (1885), &#x27;Nicias&#x27; (1887), &#x27;Timoleon&#x27; (1889), and &#x27;Demosthenes&#x27; (1893); the &#x27;Octavius&#x27; of Minucius Felix : the text newly revised from the original manuscript (1853) ; &#x27;Thucydides, book vii.&#x27; (1891) ; the comedies of Aristophanes&#x27; (1848). He published, in collaboration with Richard Dacre Archer Hind, &#x27;Sabrinæ Corolla in Hortulis Regiæ Scholæ Salopiensis continuerunt tres Viri Floribus Legendis&#x27; (1850; 4th ed. 1890), a collection of poetical extracts with translations into Latin or Greek. Holden edited also the following works for Macmillan&#x27;s &#x27;Classical Series:&#x27; Plutarch&#x27;s &#x27;Lives&#x27; of Pericles (1894) and Themistocles (1881 ; 3rd ed. enlarged, 1892); Xenophon&#x27;s &#x27;Hieron&#x27; (1883; 3rd ed. 1888) and &#x27;Œconomicus&#x27; (1884; 4th ed. 1889); and Cicero&#x27;s &#x27;Pro Public Sestio&#x27; (1883 ; 3rd ed. 1889).

<doc id="240258" wikidata="Q1137023" url="?curid=240258" title="Council of Economic Advisers">
<text>The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) is a United States agency within the Executive Office of the President established in 1946, which advises the president of the United States on economic policy. The CEA provides much of the empirical research for the White House and prepares the publicly-available annual Economic Report of the President. The council is made up of its chairperson and generally two to three additional member economists. Its chairperson requires appointment and Senate confirmation, and its other members are appointed by the President.

==Activities==
=== Economic Report of the President ===
The report is published by the CEA annually in February, no later than 10 days after the Budget of the US Government is submitted. The president typically writes a letter introducing the report, serving as an executive summary. The report proceeds with several hundred pages of qualitative and quantitative research reviewing the impact of economic activity in the previous year, outlining economic goals for the coming year (based on the President&#x27;s economic agenda), and making numerical projections of economic performance and outcomes. The data referenced or used in the report are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

==History==

=== Establishment ===
The Truman administration established the Council of Economic Advisers via the Employment Act of 1946 to provide presidents with objective economic analysis and advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and international economic policy issues. It was a step from an &quot;ad hoc style of economic policy-making to a more institutionalized and focused process&quot;. The act gave the council the following goals:

In 1949 Chairman Edwin Nourse and member Leon Keyserling argued about whether the advice should be private or public and about the role of government in economic stabilization. Nourse believed a choice had to be made between &quot;guns or butter&quot; but Keyserling argued for deficit spending, asserting that an expanding economy could afford large defense expenditures without sacrificing an increased standard of living. In 1949, Keyserling gained support from Truman advisors Dean Acheson and Clark Clifford. Nourse resigned as chairman, warning about the dangers of budget deficits and increased funding of &quot;wasteful&quot; defense costs. Keyserling succeeded to the chairmanship and influenced Truman&#x27;s Fair Deal proposals and the economic sections of NSC 68 that, in April 1950, asserted that the larger armed forces America needed would not affect living standards or risk the &quot;transformation of the free character of our economy&quot;.

=== 1950s–80s ===
During the 1953–54 recession, the CEA, headed by Arthur Burns, deployed non-traditional neo-Keynesian interventions, which provided results later called the &quot;steady fifties&quot; wherein many families stayed in the economic &quot;middle class&quot; with just one family wage-earner. The Eisenhower Administration supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish Keynesianism as a possible bipartisan economic policy for the nation. Especially important in formulating the CEA response to the recession—accelerating public works programs, easing credit, and reducing taxes—were Arthur F. Burns and Neil H. Jacoby.

Until 1963, during its first seven years the CEA made five technical advances in policy making, including the replacement of a &quot;cyclical model&quot; of the economy by a &quot;growth model&quot;, the setting of quantitative targets for the economy, use of the theories of fiscal drag and full-employment budget, recognition of the need for greater flexibility in taxation, and replacement of the notion of unemployment as a structural problem by a realization of a low aggregate demand.

The 1978 Humphrey–Hawkins Full Employment Act required each administration to move toward full employment and reasonable price stability within a specific time period. It has been criticized for making CEA&#x27;s annual economic report highly political in nature, as well as highly unreliable and inaccurate over the standard two or five year projection periods.

===1980–present===

Since 1980, the CEA has focused on sources of economic growth, the supply side of the economy, and on international issues. In the wake of the Great Recession of 2008–09, the Council of Economic Advisers played a significant role in supporting the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

President Trump has nominated Stephen Miran to be the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

==Organization==
The council&#x27;s chairman is nominated by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate. The members are appointed by the president. As of July 2017, the council&#x27;s eighteen person staff consisted of a chief of staff (Director of Macroeconomic Forecasting), fifteen economists (five senior, four research, four staff economists, two economic statisticians) and two operations staff. Many of the staff economists are academics on leave or government economists on temporary assignment from other agencies.

<text>Otto Eckstein (August 1, 1927 – March 22, 1984) was a German-American economist. He was a key developer and proponent of the theory of core inflation , which proposed that in determining accurate metrics of long run inflation, the transitory price changes of items subject to volatile pricing, such as food and energy, are to be excluded from computation.

== Life and career ==
Eckstein was born in Germany in 1927 to a Jewish business family.
In 1938, when he was 11 years old, he and several other family members fled the Nazi regime, first emigrating to England, and then, a year later, moving to the United States, where he made his permanent home. He held an A.B. from Princeton University and a Ph.D. from Harvard University and became a Harvard University economics professor, an economic consultant to President Lyndon Baines Johnson, and a member of the President&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers from 1964 to 1966. In 1969, he and Donald Marron co-founded Data Resources Inc., the largest non-governmental distributor of economic data in the world, which built and maintained the largest macroeconometric model of the era. In 1975 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. In 1979 he sold DRI for over $100 million to McGraw Hill.

Eckstein was married and had three children. He died of cancer in 1984, at the age of 56.

<text>Arthur Stanley Goldberger (November 20, 1930 – December 11, 2009) was an econometrician and an economist. He worked with Nobel Prize winner Lawrence Klein on the development of the Klein–Goldberger macroeconomic model at the University of Michigan.

He spent most of his career at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he helped build the Department of Economics. He wrote classic graduate and undergraduate econometrics textbooks, including &quot;Econometric Theory&quot; (1964), &quot;A Course in Econometrics&quot; (1991) and &quot;Introductory Econometrics&quot; (1998). Among his many accomplishments, he published a number of articles critically evaluating the literature on the heritability of IQ and other behavioral traits.

In 1968 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

<doc id="240267" wikidata="Q361215" url="?curid=240267" title="Anthony Michael Hall">
<text>Anthony Michael Hall (born Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall; April 14, 1968) is an American actor, producer and comedian. He starred in the teen-centered John Hughes films &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, and &quot;Weird Science&quot;.

Hall diversified his roles to avoid becoming typecast as his geek persona, joining the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1985–1986) and starring in films such as &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; (1986), &quot;Johnny Be Good&quot; (1988), &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990) and &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (1993). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, he starred as Microsoft&#x27;s Bill Gates in the 1999 television film &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;. He had the leading role in the USA Network series &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; from 2002 to 2007. In 2008, he appeared in a minor role in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. From 2019 to 2023, Hall appeared in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;. He also starred in the slasher film &quot;Halloween Kills&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall was born on April 14, 1968, in the West Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. He is the only child of blues-jazz singer Mercedes Hall&#x27;s first marriage. She divorced Hall&#x27;s father, Larry, an auto-body-shop owner, when their son was six months old. When Hall was three, he and his mother relocated to the West Coast, where she found work as a featured singer. After a year and a half, they returned to the East, eventually moving to New York City, where Hall grew up. Hall&#x27;s ancestry is English, Irish and Italian. He has a half-sister, Mary Chestaro, from his mother&#x27;s second marriage to Thomas Chestaro, a show business manager. His half-sister is a singer performing under the name Mary C. He transposed his first and middle names when he entered show business because there was another actor named Michael Hall who was already a member of the Screen Actors Guild. Hall attended St. Hilda&#x27;s &amp; St. Hugh&#x27;s School of New York before moving on to Manhattan&#x27;s Professional Children&#x27;s School. Hall began his acting career at age eight and continued throughout high school. &quot;I did not go to college,&quot; he has said, &quot;but I&#x27;m an avid reader in the ongoing process of educating myself.&quot; Through the 1980s, Hall&#x27;s mother managed his career, eventually relinquishing that role to her second husband.

== Career ==
=== Early years ===
At the age of seven, Hall started his career in commercials. He was the Honeycomb cereal kid and appeared in several commercials for toys and Bounty. His stage debut was in 1977, when he was cast as the young Steve Allen in Allen&#x27;s semi-autobiographical play &quot;The Wake&quot;. He went on to appear in the Lincoln Center Festival&#x27;s production of &quot;St. Joan of the Microphone&quot;, and in a play with Woody Allen. In 1980, he made his screen debut in the Emmy-winning TV movie &quot;The Gold Bug&quot;, in which he played the young Edgar Allan Poe. In 1981 he starred as Huck Finn in &quot;Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn&quot; opposite Patrick Creadon, but it was not until the release of the 1982 Kenny Rogers film &quot;Six Pack&quot; that he gained real notice.

=== John Hughes: 1983–1986 ===
The following year, Hall landed the role of Rusty Griswold, Chevy Chase and Beverly D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s son, in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, catching the attention of the film&#x27;s screenwriter John Hughes, who was about to make the jump to directing. &quot;For [Hall] to upstage Chevy, I thought, was a remarkable accomplishment for a 13-year-old kid,&quot; said Hughes. The film was a significant box office hit in 1983, grossing over $61 million in the United States. After &quot;Vacation&quot;, Hall moved on to other projects and declined to reprise his role in the 1985 sequel.

Hall&#x27;s breakout role came in 1984, when he was cast as &quot;The Geek&quot;, the scrawny, braces-wearing geek who pursued Molly Ringwald&#x27;s character in John Hughes&#x27;s directing debut &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;. Hall tried to avoid the clichés of geekiness. &quot;I didn&#x27;t play him with 100 pens sticking out of his pocket,&quot; he said. &quot;I just went in there and played it like a real kid. The geek is just a typical freshman.&quot; Hall landed a spot on the promotional materials along with co-star Ringwald. Reviews of the film were positive for Hall and his co-stars, and a review in &quot;People&quot; even claimed that Hall&#x27;s performance &quot;pilfer[ed] the film&quot; from Ringwald. Despite achieving only moderate success at the box office, the film made overnight stars of Ringwald and Hall.

In 1985, Hall starred in two additional teen-oriented films written and directed by Hughes. He was cast as Brian Johnson, &quot;the brain&quot;, in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, co-starring Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, and Molly Ringwald. Film critic Janet Maslin praised Hall, stating that the 16-year-old actor and Ringwald were &quot;the movie&#x27;s standout performers&quot;. Hall and fellow co-star Molly Ringwald dated for a short period after filming &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. Later that year, Hall portrayed Gary Wallace, another likable misfit, in &quot;Weird Science&quot;. Critic Sheila Benson from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said Hall was &quot;the role model supreme&quot; for the character, but she also acknowledged that &quot;he [was] outgrowing the role&quot; and &quot;[didn&#x27;t] need to hold the patent on the bratty bright kid&quot;. &quot;Weird Science&quot; was a moderate success at the box office but was generally well received by critics. Those roles established him as the 1980s&#x27; &quot;nerd-of-choice&quot;, as well as a member of Hollywood&#x27;s Brat Pack. Hall, who portrayed Hughes&#x27;s alter egos in &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and &quot;Weird Science&quot;, credited the director for putting him on the map and giving him those opportunities as a child. &quot;I had the time of my life,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;d consider [working with Hughes again] any day of the week.&quot;

To avoid being typecast, Hall turned down roles written for him by John Hughes in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (Cameron Frye) and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (Phil &quot;Duckie&quot; Dale), both in 1986. Instead, he starred in the 1986 film &quot;Out of Bounds&quot;, Hall&#x27;s first excursion into the thriller and action genre. The film grossed only $5 million domestically and was a critical and financial disappointment. Critic Roger Ebert described &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; as &quot;an explosion at the cliché factory&quot;, and Caryn James from &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed that not even &quot;Hall, who made nerds seem lovable in John Hughes&#x27; &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; and &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, [couldn&#x27;t] do much to reconcile&quot; the disparate themes of the movie.

=== &quot;SNL&quot;: 1985 ===
Hall joined the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live (SNL)&quot; during its 1985–86 season at the age of 17. He was, and remains, the youngest cast member in the show&#x27;s history. Art Garfunkel, Edd Byrnes, Robert F. Kennedy, and Daryl Hall were among Hall&#x27;s celebrity impersonations. Hall had admired the show and its stars as a child, but he found the &quot;SNL&quot; environment to be far more competitive than he had imagined. &quot;My year there, I didn&#x27;t have any breakout characters and I didn&#x27;t really do the things I dreamed I would do,&quot; he said, &quot;but I still learned a lot and I value that. I&#x27;ll always be proud of the fact that I was a part of its history.&quot; Hall was one of six cast members (the others being Joan Cusack, Robert Downey Jr., Randy Quaid, Terry Sweeney and Danitra Vance) who were dismissed at the end of that season.

=== Post-Hughes ===
Hall was offered the starring role in the 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; in a conversation with Stanley Kubrick, but after an eight-month negotiation, a financial agreement could not be reached. &quot;It was a difficult decision, because in that eight-month period, I read everything I could about the guy, and I was really fascinated by him,&quot; Hall said when asked about the film. &quot;I wanted to be a part of that film, but it didn&#x27;t work out. But all sorts of stories circulated, like I got on set and I was fired, or I was pissed at him for shooting too long. It&#x27;s all not true.&quot; He was replaced with Matthew Modine. His next film was 1988&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Be Good&quot;, in which he worked with Uma Thurman and fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Robert Downey Jr. The film was a critical failure, and some reviewers panned Hall&#x27;s performance as a high school football star, stating that he, the movies&#x27; reigning geek, was miscast in the role. A review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; claimed that the film was &quot;crass, vulgar, and relentlessly brain-dead&quot;.

Hall was considered for the role of Nuke Laloosh in &quot;Bull Durham&quot;. He was the top choice of Orion Pictures executives, but the actor irritated writer-director Ron Shelton by showing up unprepared for interviews. &quot;I thought Ron was going to shoot him,&quot; said producer Mark Burg.

=== 1990s ===
After a two-year break due to a reported drinking problem, Hall returned to acting by starring opposite Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder in Tim Burton&#x27;s 1990 hit &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, this time as the film&#x27;s villain. By then in his 20s, he shifted to more mature roles, trying to establish himself as an adult actor. After &quot;Scissorhands&quot;, he appeared in a series of low-budget films, including the 1990 film &quot;A Gnome Named Gnorm&quot;, where he starred as a detective who was forced to team up with a strange looking Gnome, making for a buddy cop movie with mixed reviews. He also was in the 1992 comedy &quot;Into the Sun&quot;, where he starred as a visiting celebrity at a military air base. Film critic Janet Maslin praised his performance, writing that &quot;Hall, whose earlier performances (in films like &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; and &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;) have been much goofier, remains coolly funny and graduates to subtler forms of comedy with this role.&quot; The following year, he played a gay man who teaches down-and-out Will Smith to dupe rich people in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;; Hall claimed that it was &quot;the hardest role [he] ever had&quot;.

In 1994, Hall starred in and directed his first feature film, a low-budget Showtime comedy titled &quot;Hail Caesar&quot; about a would-be rock star who works in a pencil eraser factory. The film also co-starred Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Downey Jr., and Judd Nelson. In addition, he produced the soundtrack for the film with composer Herbie Tribino. The film featured songs written and performed by Hall.

=== Music ===
Following his family tradition, Hall pursued his other passion of music. He was the lead singer and songwriter for his band, Hall of Mirrors, formed in 1998. The band released an album, &quot;Welcome to the Hall of Mirrors&quot;, through Hall&#x27;s own RAM Records label in 1999, with collaborations from former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke and Prince&#x27;s former keyboard player Tommy Barbarella. It featured songs from his self-directed film &quot;Hail Caesar&quot; (1994).

=== Bill Gates ===
After a series of appearances in low-budget films and guest roles on TV series in the mid and late 1990s, he gained media attention once again in the 1999 Emmy-nominated TNT original movie &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;, co-starring Noah Wyle as Apple Computer&#x27;s Steve Jobs. Hall was widely praised for his portrayal of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates. &quot;I really fought for this part because I knew it would be the role of a lifetime,&quot; Hall said. &quot;It was a thrill and a daunting challenge to play someone of his stature and brilliance.&quot; Hall described his physical appearance as 20-year-old Gates to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;:

=== 2000s ===
After making a cameo appearance as himself in the 2000 comedy film &quot;Happy Accidents&quot;, Hall appeared in several made-for-TV films. He starred opposite Sheryl Lee as a cheating husband in the 2001 USA Network cable movie &quot;Hitched&quot;. In the same year, he played renowned music producer Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange in VH1&#x27;s movie &quot;Hysteria: The Def Leppard Story&quot; and starred as legendary lefty baseball pitcher Whitey Ford in Billy Crystal&#x27;s highly acclaimed HBO film, &quot;61*&quot;.

On the big screen, Hall took on supporting roles in the mystery-drama &quot;The Caveman&#x27;s Valentine&quot; (2001) opposite Samuel L. Jackson, the critically panned &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; (2001) opposite Tom Green, and the action-comedy &quot;All About the Benjamins&quot; (2002) opposite Ice Cube.

=== &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;: 2002–2007 ===
Hall began his first regular series role in 2002, starring as Johnny Smith in USA Network&#x27;s supernatural drama &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, a TV series adapted from Stephen King&#x27;s best-selling novel. He was cast in the show after executive producer Michael Piller saw his performance in &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;. The show debuted on June 16, 2002, and drew higher ratings for a premiere than any other cable series in television history with 6.4 million viewers. &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and Hall receiving strong reviews. The &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; wrote that &quot;Hall&#x27;s Johnny flashes the qualities - comic timing, great facial expressions - that made him a star in the 1980s movies &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; and &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, Hall said, &quot;has transformed my career.&quot; The show proved to be one of USA Network&#x27;s top shows and one of the highest-rated programs on basic cable.

&quot;The Dead Zone&quot; opening credits list Hall as co-producer (seasons 1–3), producer (seasons 5) and co-executive producer (season 6). Hall also directed an episode from season three, &quot;The Cold Hard Truth,&quot; guest starring standup comic Richard Lewis. &quot;[&#x27;The Cold Hard Truth&#x27;], I feel, is my best work as a director, because I had this great crew that knows me well and has been working with me,&quot; said Hall. &quot;I also had the best script that I&#x27;ve had an opportunity to direct.&quot; The show&#x27;s sixth and final season premiered on June 17, 2007. USA Network officially canceled &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; in December 2007.

=== Late 2000s ===
Hall appeared in the tenth episode of &quot;Criss Angel Mindfreak&quot;″s fourth season.

In 2008, Hall appeared as Gotham City television reporter/anchor Mike Engel in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;.

Hall develops film and television projects under his production company banner AMH Entertainment. Hall starred in &quot;Aftermath&quot;, a 2010 independent crime-drama film, with Tony Danza and Frank Whaley.

=== 2010s ===

Hall made guest appearances in two episodes of the sitcom &quot;Community&quot;.

In 2011, he played the main antagonist in Season 3 of &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;. He played Walter Sykes, a man who once benefited from the use of an artifact but harboured a deep-seated anger towards the Warehouse and its agents when the artifact was taken from him (episodes 3.09, 3.11, 3.12). He also guest-starred in &quot;Z Nation&quot; in the role of Gideon, a former communications manager leading a group of zombie apocalypse survivors (only episode 2.11).

Hall reprised his role as Rusty Griswold from &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation,&quot; in a series of Old Navy 2012 holiday commercials featuring the Griswold family. 
In 2015, Hall was cast in the 2017 Netflix film &quot;War Machine&quot; and worked alongside Brad Pitt. Hall played General Greg Pulver, a character based on U.S. General Michael Flynn, who became a controversial public figure around the time of the film&#x27;s release. At the end of production, Pitt presented his co-stars with engraved wristwatches as a memento for their time making the film. Hall: &quot;It was just such a privilege to work with him [Pitt].&quot;

In 2016, Hall played himself as a customer in an AT&amp;T Mobile commercial. The same year, Hall was cast in a recurring role on the TNT drama series &quot;Murder in the First&quot;.

In 2019, Hall began appearing on the ABC sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, when he played Rusty in the season 7 premiere, &quot;Vacation&quot;, which paid homage to and poked fun at his character from the 1983 film. He had a recurring role on the show as guidance counselor Mr. Perott for the remainder of the series.

=== 2020s– ===
Hall was cast as Tommy Doyle in the 2021 &quot;Halloween&quot; sequel, &quot;Halloween Kills&quot;. While he expressed interest in returning for 2022&#x27;s &quot;Halloween Ends&quot;, this did not come to pass.

In 2023, Hall appeared in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;&quot; for 5 episodes, a follow-up to the critical acclaimed series &quot;Bosch&quot; (2014–2021).

Hall was cast in Lee Child&#x27;s hit series &quot;Reacher&quot;, and will appear in the third season as the role of Zachary Beck.

As of June 2024 Hall was said to be developing a new series with Robert Downey Jr called &quot;Singularity&quot;.

== In the media ==

Hall became a regular subject of tabloid media after &quot;New York&quot; magazine named him a member of the &quot;Brat Pack&quot;, the group of young actors who became famous in the 1980s and frequently starred together. In the late 1980s, Hall&#x27;s drinking problem, which began in his early teens, made headlines. Hall eventually quit drinking and became fully sober by 1990. &quot;The truth is, I had my partying nights, but I never really bounced at the bottom,&quot; he said. &quot;I never went to rehab...I was able to govern myself and continue my work.&quot;

In 1990, Hall&#x27;s physical appearance in &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; surprised audiences. His more muscular appearance and intimidating physical demeanor provoked rumors of steroid use, but Hall later said that &quot;the weight gain was natural.&quot;

Hall&#x27;s role in the 1993 film &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; made news not because of what occurred onscreen, but rather what failed to occur. Hall played a gay love interest to Will Smith, who had previously agreed to a kissing scene between the two. However, on the day of the shoot, Smith refused to film the scene. Smith told the press that he called Denzel Washington for advice, who told him that an onscreen same-sex kiss was a bad career move. When asked about the incident during an interview, Hall said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t care. I wasn&#x27;t that comfortable with it, either, and ultimately, we used a camera trick.&quot;

=== Disturbance ===
On November 17, 2016, the Los Angeles District Attorney charged Hall with felony assault with serious bodily injury following a September 13 confrontation with a neighbor at Hall&#x27;s Playa del Rey condominium complex. In September 2017, Hall pleaded no contest to a lesser charge, was found guilty, and sentenced to three years probation and 40 hours of community service. He was subsequently sued by the victim. In August 2020, Hall caught the media&#x27;s attention after an argument with hotel guests at a pool in Austin, Texas. Hall apologized immediately afterwards.

==Recognition==
The 2001 film &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; pays tribute to Hall&#x27;s numerous appearances in the teen-oriented, 1980s comedy films parodied by the movie. A brief shot of the sign over the door of a high school cafeteria reveals that the facility is named the Anthony Michael Dining Hall. In 2006, Hall was ranked #4 in VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Teen Stars&quot; and number 41 in &quot;100 Greatest Kid Stars&quot;.

In June 2005, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; was rewarded with the Silver Bucket of Excellence Award at the MTV Movie Awards, in honor of the film&#x27;s twentieth anniversary. For the show, MTV attempted to reunite the original cast. Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, and Hall appeared together on stage, and Paul Gleason gave the award to his former castmates. 
Emilio Estevez could not attend due to family commitments, while Judd Nelson appeared earlier on the red carpet, but while moving to seats closer to the stage, got separated from the group. Hall quipped that the two were &quot;in Africa with Dave Chappelle.&quot;

==Personal life==
As of 2016, Hall lives in the Playa del Rey neighborhood of Los Angeles. He is godfather to Robert Downey Jr.&#x27;s son, Indio Falconer Downey.

In 2019, Hall became engaged to Slovak-Canadian actress Lucia Oskerova. In February 2023, they announced that they were expecting their first child. Their son was born in June 2023.

Hall assists at-risk youth through his literacy program, The Anthony Michael Hall Literacy Club, in association with Chapman University.

=== Politics ===
Hall, during a 2020 interview on YouTube, described Republican president Donald Trump as &quot;great&quot; and further stated &quot;I think what he&#x27;s done for the country is incredible&quot;. Hall also suggested that conservative actors get blacklisted in Hollywood and said he had personally witnessed it in practice.

<doc id="240270" wikidata="Q379715" url="?curid=240270" title="Advanced SCSI Programming Interface">
<text>The Advanced SCSI Programming Interface (ASPI) is a programming interface developed by Adaptec which standardizes communication on a computer bus between a SCSI driver module on the one hand and SCSI (and ATAPI) peripherals on the other.

== Structure ==
The ASPI manager software provides an interface between ASPI modules (device drivers or applications with direct SCSI support), a SCSI host adapter, and SCSI devices connected to the host adapter. The ASPI manager is specific to the host adapter and operating system; its primary role is to abstract the host adapter specifics and provide a generic software interface to SCSI devices.

On Windows 9x and Windows NT, the ASPI manager is generic and relies on the services of SCSI miniport drivers. On those systems, the ASPI interface is designed for applications which require SCSI pass-through functionality (such as CD-ROM burning software).

The primary operations supported by ASPI are discovery of host adapters and attached devices, and submitting SCSI commands to devices via SRBs (SCSI Request Blocks). ASPI supports concurrent execution of SCSI commands.

== History ==

ASPI was developed by Adaptec around 1989 and was formally introduced in January 1990. Originally supporting only MS-DOS, support for NetWare was added in 1991, while support for OS/2 and Windows 3.x was added in 1992. Originally developed only for SCSI devices, support for ATAPI devices was added later. Most other SCSI host adapter vendors (for example BusLogic, DPT, AMI, Future Domain, DTC) shipped their own ASPI managers with their hardware.

Adaptec also developed generic SCSI disk and CD-ROM drivers for DOS ( and ).

At least a couple of other programming interfaces for SCSI device drivers competed with ASPI in the early 1990s, including CAM (Common Access Method), developed by Apple; and Layered Device Driver Architecture, developed by Microsoft. However, ASPI was far and away more common than any of its competitors in this space, with &quot;PC Magazine&quot; declaring it a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for developing SCSI device drivers only two years after its introduction.

Starting in 1995, Microsoft licensed the interface for use with their Windows 9x operating systems. At the same time Microsoft developed SCSI Pass Through Interface (SPTI), an in-house substitute that worked on the NT platform. Microsoft did not include ASPI in Windows 2000/XP, in favor of its own SPTI.

To support USB drives under DOS, Panasonic developed a universal ASPI driver () that bypasses the lack of native USB support by DOS.

== Drivers ==
ASPI was provided by the following drivers:

<doc id="240294" wikidata="Q2779171" url="?curid=240294" title="Urizen">
<text>In the mythology of William Blake, Urizen () is the embodiment of conventional reason and law. He is usually depicted as a bearded old man; he sometimes bears architect&#x27;s tools, to create and constrain the universe; or nets, with which he ensnares people in webs of law and conventional society. Originally, Urizen represented one half of a two-part system, with him representing reason and Los, his opposition, representing imagination. In Blake&#x27;s reworking of his mythic system, Urizen is one of the four &quot;Zoas&quot; that result from the division of the primordial man, Albion, and he continues to represent reason. He has an Emanation, or paired female equivalent, Ahania, who stands for Pleasure. In Blake&#x27;s myth, Urizen is joined by many daughters with three representing aspects of the body. He is also joined by many sons, with four representing the four elements. These sons join in rebellion against their father but are later united in the Last Judgment. In many of Blake&#x27;s books, Urizen is seen with four books that represent the various laws that he places upon humanity.

==Character==
In Blake&#x27;s original myth, Urizen, the representation of abstractions and an abstraction of the human self, is the first entity. He believes himself holy and he sets about establishing various sins in a book of brass that serves as a combination of various laws as discovered by Newton, given to Moses, and the general concept of deism, which force uniformity upon mankind. The rest of the Eternals in turn become indignant at Urizen turning against eternity, and they instill these essences of sin within Urizen&#x27;s creation. This torments Urizen, and Los soon after appears. Los&#x27;s duty within the work is to watch over Urizen and serve as his opposition.

In terms of Blake&#x27;s Orc cycle, Urizen serves as a Satanic force similar to Milton&#x27;s Satan. After Urizen defeats the serpent/Orc figure in the Garden of Eden story, the Orc figure, in the form of Urizen&#x27;s son Fuzon, battles against him in a story based on Exodus. Urizen, as a pillar of cloud that hinders the Israelites in their journey home, battles against Fuzon, as a pillar of fire that guides them by night. Eventually, Urizen is able to destroy his rebellious son and impose laws upon the Israelites in the form of the Ten Commandments. This also leads to a death of the Israelite society, and the Israelites under Urizen are imprisoned in a similar manner to how they were under the Egyptians. Symbolically, the Orc cycle describes how Urizen and Orc are part of one unified whole, with Urizen representing the destructive and older essence while Orc is the young and creative essence.

In Blake&#x27;s later myth, Urizen is one of the four Zoas, the fourfold division of the central god. The other three represent aspects of the trinity and he represents the fallen, Satanic figure although he is also the creator figure. Among the Zoas, he represents the south and the concept of reason. He is described as what binds and controls the universe through creating laws. He is connected to his Emanation known as Ahania, the representation of pleasure, and he is opposed to the Zoa named Urthona, the representation of Imagination. His name can mean many things, from &quot;Your Reason&quot; or a Greek word meaning &quot;to limit&quot;. Urizen originates in the beginning of Blake&#x27;s version of Genesis. He was the entity created when a voice said that light should be born, and he was the fourth child of the characters Albion and Vala. He is said to represent the Heavenly host, but he experiences a Satanic fall in that he desired to rule. He is motivated by his pride and becomes a hypocrite. When Albion asks for him, Urizen refuses and hides, which causes him to experience his fall. After his fall, Urizen set about creating the material world and his jealousy of mankind brought forth both Wrath and Justice.

In the material world, he had Steeds and a Chariot of Day that were stolen from him by Luvah. This occurred because he, reason, sought to take over the Northern lands of Luvah, Imagination. After setting to take over Imagination, Luvah&#x27;s stealing of the horses, which represented instruction, showed how emotion could dominate over reason. After Luvah falls and becomes Orc, Urizen tries to regain his horses but can only witness them bound. Eventually, the horses are returned to him after the Final Judgment.

Within the early works, Urizen represents the chains of reason that are imposed on the mind. Urizen, like mankind, is bound by these chains. Additionally, these works describe how Newtonian reason and the enlightenment view of the universe traps the imagination. The poems emphasize an evolutionary development within the universe, and this early version of a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; universe is connected to a fallen world of tyranny and murder.

Urizen&#x27;s daughters started as the children of light and are possible images of either the planets or of the stars. After his fall, they gain human form. Three of his daughters are Eleth, Uveth and Ona, which represent the three parts of the human body. Together, they also organize the waters of Generation, they are the creators of the Bread of Sorrow, and read from the Book of Iron. At the Last Judgment, they watch over Ahania. His sons are differently organised, in different poems: as Thiriel, Utha, Grodna, Fuzon, aligned with the four classical elements; or as twelve, aligned with the signs of the Zodiac, and builders of the Mundane Shell and seek to keep mankind from falling. In Blake&#x27;s early myths, they dwell in various cities and do not abide by Urizen&#x27;s laws; Fuzon directly rebels against Urizen, is able to cut Urizen&#x27;s loins, and is crucified for his actions. In later versions of the children, they are wise and dwell with Urizen. They, with Urizen, fall after Luvah takes over Urizen&#x27;s realm. After their fall, they are tortured in hell, and Urizen&#x27;s creation of science is seen as his domination over them. However, the four sons are placed in charge of Urthona&#x27;s armies and rebel against Urizen&#x27;s rule. During the Last Judgment, the sons get rid of their weapons and celebrate Urizen&#x27;s return to the plow, and they join together for the harvest.

Urizen is described as having multiple books: Gold, Silver, Iron, and Brass. They represent science, love, war, and sociology, which are four aspects of life. The books are filled with laws that seek to overcome the seven deadly sins. He constantly adds to the works, even when he faces his opposition in Orc, but the books are destroyed in the Last Judgment. The Book of Brass sets forth Urizen&#x27;s social beliefs that seek to remove all pain and instill peace under one rule. The attempt to force love through law encouraged the Eternals to put forth the Seven Deadly Sins that Urizen hoped to prevent. The Book of Iron was lost in the Tree of Mystery, and represents how Urizen can create wars but cannot control them.

==Appearances==

The character Urizen is first directly mentioned in Blake&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Liberty&quot; (1793) where he is first described in his dispute with Orc. He is described as a &quot;starry king&quot;. In &quot;To Nobodaddy&quot;, he is given the title &quot;Father of Jealousy&quot; and he is an enslaver. In &quot;America a Prophecy&quot;, he is the evil God who rules during the Enlightenment. The work also describes how Urizen created the world. This was followed by the &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; (1794) where he appears as the creator of the Tyger and in many of the poems: &quot;Earth&#x27;s Answer&quot;, &quot;The Tyger&quot;, &quot;The Human Abstract&quot; and &quot;A Divine Image&quot;. He is mentioned later that year in &quot;Europe a Prophecy&quot; and it is in the work that Urizen is freed from his bounds and he opens the Book of Brass in response to the American revolution.

In the &quot;Book of Urizen&quot;, Urizen is an eternal self-focused being that creates itself out of eternity, and, it is only Urizen, the representation of abstractions and is an abstraction of the human self that exists in the beginning. Eventually, he creates the rest of creation but is tormented from the rest of the Eternal essence. Urizen is seen as the essence of the eternal priest and is opposed by Los, the eternal prophet. Parts of the story were later revised in &quot;The Book of Los&quot; and &quot;The Book of Ahania&quot;: The &quot;Book of Ahania&quot; describes Urizen&#x27;s relationship with his son Fuzon, and the &quot;Book of Los&quot; (1795) describes Urizen&#x27;s creations from Los&#x27;s viewpoint. The &quot;Song of Los&quot; (1795) describes how Urizen&#x27;s laws are given to humanity and their destructive effects. The work ends with Orc&#x27;s appearance and Urizen weeping.

Urizen appears within Blake&#x27;s illustrations of Job as an image of Apollo. He and his realm are described in Blake&#x27;s &quot;Milton a Poem&quot;, and he is said to have a throne of silver/love. His realm included his children and was surrounded by justice and eternal science. The work also describes Urizen&#x27;s Satanic fall. The Urizen of &quot;Milton&quot; is in the form of reason, and it is he that Milton follows. He appears again in the image &quot;Milton&#x27;s Dream&quot; as illustrated for &quot;Il Penseroso&quot;. In the image, Urizen is with images of despair and is interfering with the image of the true God.

In &quot;Vala, or The Four Zoas&quot;, Urizen was said to have been born as the son of Albion and Vala, and is the fourth son. He was made the leader of Heaven&#x27;s host and commanded the material sun. The work also describes his fall. Urizen appears in &quot;Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion&quot; in a form similar to the previous works. Urizen is the organiser of the universe while Los is the forger. He creates Natural Religion, and, in his returned form after Albion awakes, he is a farmer.

==Derivation==

Urizen has clear similarities with the creature called the Demiurge by Gnostic sects, who is likewise largely derived of the Old Testament god (more specifically, like Blake&#x27;s Urizen, the demiurge is a radical remodelling of that figure achieved by expanding that figure&#x27;s original contextual setting, or by removing him to one that is almost completely new). Speculative Freemasonry is another possible source of Blake&#x27;s imagery for Urizen; Blake was attracted to the Masonic and Druidic speculations of William Stukeley. The compass and other drafting symbols that Blake associates with Urizen borrow from Masonic symbolism for God as the &quot;Great Architect of the Universe&quot;.

<text>Pierre de la Broce or de la Brosse (died 30 June 1278) was a royal favorite and councilor during the early reign of Philip III of France.

De la Broce was from a family of petty nobility in Touraine, and was the royal physician (by 1255) and chamberlain (by 1266) for Louis IX. After Louis&#x27; death in 1270, de la Broce quickly became a favorite of the new king. He accumulated a substantial fortune, built from Philip&#x27;s largess and from gifts from those hoping to cultivate his influence with the king.

This influence was greatly resented by many of the nobility and by associates of the Queen. In 1276 he was accused of having poisoned the king&#x27;s eldest son and his wife, Isabelle d&#x27;Aragon. In 1277 letters allegedly written by de la Broce were presented to Philip, which caused the king to have de la Broce arrested. He was finally hanged six months later. No trial was held, and the evidence was apparently suppressed, so the contents of the letters are unknown. Evidence has been put forward that de la Broce was framed.

==Divine Comedy==
De la Broce appears in Dante&#x27;s Purgatory, in Canto VI, with the other spirits of those who, though redeemed, were prevented from making a final confession and reconciliation due to having died by violence:

:I saw the soul&lt;br&gt;
:cleft from its body out of spite and envy—&lt;br&gt;
:not, so it said, because it had been guilty—&lt;br&gt;
:I mean Pier de la Brosse,&lt;br&gt;
:and may the Lady of Brabant [the Queen of France]&lt;br&gt;
:while she&#x27;s still in this world, watch&lt;br&gt;
:her ways—or end among a sadder flock&lt;br&gt;

<text>Amboise (; ) is a commune in the Indre-et-Loire department in central France. Today a small market town, it was once home of the French royal court.

==Geography==
Amboise lies on the banks of the river Loire, east of Tours. It is also about away from the historic Château de Chenonceau, situated on the river Cher near the small village of Chenonceaux. Amboise station, on the north bank of the Loire, has rail connections to Orléans, Blois and Tours.

==History==
Clovis I ( 466 – 511) and the Visigoths signed a peace treaty of alliance with the Arvernians in 503, which assisted him in his defeat of the Visigothic kingdom in the Battle of Vouillé in 507.

Joan of Arc passed through in 1429 on her way to Orleans to the Battle of Patay.

Château du Clos Lucé was the residence of Leonardo da Vinci between 1516 and his death in 1519. Da Vinci died in the arms of King Francis I, and he was buried in a crypt near the Château d&#x27;Amboise. The house has lost some of its original parts, but it still stands today containing a museum of da Vinci&#x27;s work and inventions, and overlooks the river Loire.

The Amboise conspiracy was the conspiracy of Condé and the Huguenots in 1560 against Francis II, Catherine de&#x27; Medici and the Guises.

The Château at Amboise was home to Mary Stewart, Queen of Scots, for much of her early life, being raised there at the French court of Henry II. She arrived in France from Scotland in 1548, aged six, via the French king&#x27;s favourite palace at Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris, and remained in France until 1561, when she returned to her homeland—sailing up the Firth of Forth to Edinburgh on 15 August that year.

The Edict of Amboise (1563) conceded the free exercise of worship to the Protestants.
 
Here was born in 1743 Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, French philosopher, known as &quot;Le Philosophe Inconnu&quot; (d. 1803).

Abd el Kader Ibn Mouhi Ad-Din (c. 1807 – 1883) was imprisoned at the Château d&#x27;Amboise.

In 2019, the 500th anniversary of da Vinci&#x27;s death, Amboise held many events celebrating the master&#x27;s life and his work completed in the town. The number of visitors to Château du Clos Lucé, for example, was estimated as 500,000 in 2019, a 30% increase over the typical annual number.

==Population==
==Sights==
The city is known for the Clos Lucé manor house where Leonardo da Vinci lived (and ultimately died) at the invitation of King Francis I of France, whose Château d&#x27;Amboise, which dominates the town, is located just away. The narrow streets contain some good examples of timbered housing.

Just outside the city is the Pagode de Chanteloup, a Chinese pagoda built in 1775 by the Duke of Choiseul. The pagoda is seven levels high, with each level slightly smaller than the last one. An interior staircase to reach all levels is open to the public.

The Musée de la Poste (in the Hôtel Joyeuse) is a museum tracing the history of the postal delivery service.

A 20th-century fountain by Max Ernst stands in front of the market place.

== Economy ==
Amboise has a thriving tourism-related business community. Until 2021, it had also the headquarters of Mecachrome, a precision engineering company that operates in the aerospace, motor racing, energy and defence sectors.

==International relations==
Amboise is twinned with:
* Boppard, Germany
* Fana, Mali
* Suwa (prefecture of Nagano), Japan
* Vinci, Italy
* Băleni (province of Galați), Romania

<text>The Aboriginal Tasmanians (palawa kani: Palawa or Pakana) are the Aboriginal people of the Australian island of Tasmania, located south of the mainland. At the time of European contact, Aboriginal Tasmanians were divided into a number of distinct ethnic groups. For much of the 20th century, the Tasmanian Aboriginal people were widely, and erroneously, thought of as extinct and intentionally exterminated by white settlers. Contemporary figures (2016) for the number of people of Tasmanian Aboriginal descent vary according to the criteria used to determine this identity, ranging from 6,000 to over 23,000.

First arriving in Tasmania (then a peninsula of Australia) around 40,000 years ago, the ancestors of the Aboriginal Tasmanians were cut off from the Australian mainland by rising sea levels 6000 BC. They were entirely isolated from the outside world for 8,000 years until European contact.

Before British colonisation of Tasmania in 1803, there were an estimated 3,000–15,000 Aboriginal Tasmanians. The Aboriginal Tasmanian population suffered a drastic drop in numbers within three decades, so that by 1835 only some 400 full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal people survived, most of this remnant being incarcerated in camps where all but 47 died within the following 12 years. No consensus exists as to the cause, over which a major controversy arose. The traditional view, still affirmed, held that this dramatic demographic collapse was the result of the impact of introduced diseases, rather than the consequence of policy. Others attributed the depletion to losses in the Black War, and the prostitution of women. Many historians of colonialism and genocide consider that the Tasmanian decimation qualifies as genocide by the definition of Raphael Lemkin adopted in the UN Genocide Convention.

By 1833, George Augustus Robinson, sponsored by Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur, had persuaded the approximately 200 surviving Aboriginal Tasmanians to surrender themselves with assurances that they would be protected and provided for, and eventually have their lands returned. These assurances were no more than a ruse by Robinson or Lieutenant-Governor Arthur to transport the Tasmanians quietly to a permanent exile in the Furneaux Islands. The survivors were moved to Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment on Flinders Island, where disease continued to reduce their numbers. In 1847, the last 47 survivors on Wybalenna were transferred to Oyster Cove, south of Hobart. Two individuals, Truganini (1812–1876) and Fanny Cochrane Smith (1834–1905), are separately considered to have been the last people solely of Tasmanian descent.

All of the Aboriginal Tasmanian languages have been lost; research suggests that the languages spoken on the island belonged to several distinct language families. Some original Tasmanian language words remained in use with Palawa people (a community of people descended from European men and Tasmanian Aboriginal women on the Furneaux Islands off Tasmania, which survives to the present) and there are some efforts to reconstruct a language from the available wordlists. Today, some thousands of people living in Tasmania describe themselves as Aboriginal Tasmanians, since a number of Tasmanian Aboriginal women bore children to European men in the Furneaux Islands and mainland Tasmania.

==History==
===Before European settlement===
People crossed into Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago via a land bridge between the island and the rest of mainland Australia, during the Last Glacial Period. Genetic studies show that once the sea level rose to flood the Bassian Plain, the island&#x27;s population was isolated for approximately 8,000 years, until European exploration in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

The discovery of 19,000-year-old deposits at Kutikina (or Fraser) Cave demonstrated occupation of the highlands since the Ice Age. In 1990, archaeologists excavated material in the Warreen Cave in the Maxwell River valley of the south-west, proving Aboriginal occupation from as early as 34,000 BP, making Aboriginal Tasmanians the southernmost population in the world during the Pleistocene era. Digs in southwest and central Tasmania turned up abundant finds, affording &quot;the richest archaeological evidence from Pleistocene Greater Australia&quot; from 35,000 to 11,000 BP.

==== Migration chronology ====
Tasmania was colonised by successive waves of Aboriginal people from southern Australia during glacial maxima, when the sea was at its lowest. The archeological and geographic record suggests a period of drying during the colder glacial period, with a desert extending from southern Australia into the midlands of Tasmania, with intermittent periods of wetter, warmer climate. Migrants from southern Australia into peninsular Tasmania would have crossed stretches of seawater and desert, and finally found oases in the King highlands (now King Island).

The archeological, geographic and linguistic record suggests successive waves of occupation of Tasmania, and coalescence of three language groups into one broad group. Colonial settlers found two main language and ethnic groups in Tasmania upon their arrival, the western &quot;Nara&quot; and eastern &quot;Mara.&quot; The admixture of &quot;Nara&quot; toponyms (place-names) in the Eastern territory of the &quot;Mara&quot; languages seem to be a relic of ancient conquests mirroring the hostilities during colonial times.
* &quot;Pleistocene Palawa&quot; language group – the first ethnic and language group in Tasmania; absorbed or displaced by successive invasions except for remnant group on Tasman peninsula. Absorbed population in Eastern Tasmania combined with &quot;Victorian&quot; speakers to form &quot;Mara&quot; language group across broader eastern Tasmania
* &quot;Furneaux speakers&quot; displace Palawa in north-east Tasmania as far south as Orford. Themselves disappear or are absorbed into the &quot;Mara&quot; language group, a composite of Pleistocene Palawa, Furneaux, and Victorian
* &quot;Nara&quot; speakers invade, but are pushed back to Western Tasmania. Correlates with Western nation of Tasmanian Aboriginal people.

After the sea rose to create Bass Strait, the Australian mainland and Tasmania became separate land masses, and the Aboriginal people who had migrated from mainland Australia became cut off from their cousins on the mainland. Archeological evidence suggests remnant populations on the King and Furneaux highlands were stranded by the rising waters and died out.

===Early European contact===
Abel Jansen Tasman, credited as the first European to discover Tasmania (in 1642) and who named it Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, did not encounter any of the Aboriginal Tasmanians when he landed.
In 1772, a French exploratory expedition under Marion Dufresne visited Tasmania. At first, contact with the Aboriginal people was friendly; however the Aboriginal Tasmanians became alarmed when another boat was dispatched towards the shore. It was reported that spears and stones were thrown and the French responded with musket fire, killing at least one Aboriginal person and wounding several others. Two later French expeditions led by Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux in 1792–93 and Nicolas Baudin in 1802 made friendly contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians; the d&#x27;Entrecasteaux expedition doing so over an extended period of time.

The &quot;Resolution&quot; under Captain Tobias Furneaux (part of an expedition led by Captain James Cook) had visited in 1773 but made no contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians although gifts were left for them in unoccupied shelters found on Bruny Island. The first known British contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians was on Bruny Island by Captain Cook in 1777. The contact was peaceful. Captain William Bligh also visited Bruny Island in 1788 and made peaceful contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.

===Contact with sealers, and the formation of the Bass Strait community===
More extensive contact between Aboriginal Tasmanians and Europeans resulted when British and American seal hunters began visiting the islands in Bass Strait as well as the northern and eastern coasts of Tasmania from the late 1790s. Shortly thereafter (by about 1800), sealers were regularly left on uninhabited islands in Bass Strait during the sealing season (November to May). The sealers established semi-permanent camps or settlements on the islands, which were close enough for the sealers to reach the main island of Tasmania in small boats and so make contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.

Trading relationships developed between sealers and Tasmanian Aboriginal tribes. Hunting dogs became highly prized by the Aboriginal people, as were other exotic items such as flour, tea and tobacco. The Aboriginal people traded kangaroo skins for such goods. However, a trade in Aboriginal women soon developed. Many Tasmanian Aboriginal women were highly skilled in hunting seals, as well as in obtaining other foods such as seabirds, and some Tasmanian tribes would trade their services and, more rarely, those of Aboriginal men to the sealers for the seal-hunting season. Others were sold on a permanent basis. This trade incorporated not only women of the tribe engaged in the trade but also women abducted from other tribes. Some may have been given to incorporate the new arrivals into Aboriginal society through marriage.

Sealers engaged in raids along the coasts to abduct Aboriginal women and were reported to have killed Aboriginal men in the process. By 1810 seal numbers had been greatly reduced by hunting so most seal hunters abandoned the area, however a small number of sealers, approximately fifty mostly &quot;renegade sailors, escaped convicts or ex-convicts&quot;, remained as permanent residents of the Bass Strait islands and some established families with Tasmanian Aboriginal women.

Some of the women were taken back to the islands by the sealers involuntarily and some went willingly, as in the case of a woman called Tarenorerer (Eng: Walyer). Differing opinions have been given on Walyer&#x27;s involvement with the sealers. McFarlane writes that she voluntarily joined the sealers with members of her family, and was responsible for attacking Aboriginal people and white settlers alike. Ryan comes to a different conclusion, that Walyer had been abducted at Port Sorell by Aboriginal people and traded to the sealers for dogs and flour. Walyer was later to gain some notoriety for her attempts to kill the sealers to escape their brutality. Walyer, a Punnilerpanner, joined the Plairhekehillerplue band after eventually escaping and went on to lead attacks on employees of the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company. Walyer&#x27;s attacks are the first recorded use of muskets by Aboriginal people. Captured, she refused to work and was banished to Penguin Island. Later imprisoned on Swan Island she attempted to organise a rebellion. Although Aboriginal women were by custom forbidden to take part in war, several Aboriginal women who escaped from sealers became leaders or took part in attacks. According to Lyndall Ryan, the women traded to or kidnapped by sealers became &quot;a significant dissident group&quot; against European/white authority.

Historian James Bonwick reported Aboriginal women who were clearly captives of sealers but he also reported women living with sealers who &quot;proved faithful and affectionate to their new husbands&quot;, women who appeared &quot;content&quot; and others who were allowed to visit their &quot;native tribe&quot;, taking gifts, with the sealers being confident that they would return. Bonwick also reports a number of claims of brutality by sealers towards Aboriginal women including some of those made by Robinson. An Aboriginal woman by the name of Bulrer related her experience to Robinson, that sealers had rushed her camp and stolen six women including herself &quot;the white men tie them and then they flog them very much, plenty much blood, plenty cry.&quot; Sealing captain James Kelly wrote in 1816 that the custom of the sealers was to each have &quot;two to five of these native women for their own use and benefit&quot;. A shortage of women available &quot;in trade&quot; resulted in abduction becoming common, and in 1830 it was reported that at least fifty Aboriginal women were &quot;kept in slavery&quot; on the Bass Strait islands.

There are numerous stories of the sealers&#x27; brutality towards the Aboriginal women; with some of these reports originating from Robinson. In 1830, Robinson seized 14 Aboriginal women from the sealers, planning for them to marry Aboriginal men at the Flinders Island settlement. Josephine Flood, an archaeologist specialising in Australian mainland Aboriginal peoples, notes: &quot;he encountered strong resistance from the women as well as sealers&quot;. The sealers sent a representative, James Munro, to appeal to Governor George Arthur and argue for the women&#x27;s return, on the basis that they wanted to stay with their sealer husbands and children rather than marry Aboriginal men unknown to them. Arthur ordered the return of some of the women. Shortly thereafter, Robinson began to disseminate stories, told to him by James Munro, of atrocities allegedly committed by the sealers against Aboriginal people, and against Aboriginal women in particular. Brian Plomley, who edited Robinson&#x27;s papers, expressed scepticism about these atrocities and notes that they were not reported to Archdeacon William Broughton&#x27;s 1830 committee of inquiry into violence towards Tasmanians. Abduction and ill-treatment of Aboriginal Tasmanians certainly occurred, but the extent is debated.

The raids for and trade in Aboriginal women contributed to the rapid depletion of the numbers of Aboriginal women in the northern areas of Tasmania – &quot;by 1830 only three women survived in northeast Tasmania among 72 men&quot; – and thus contributed in a significant manner to the demise of the full-blooded Aboriginal population of Tasmania. However, a mixed-race community of partial Tasmanian Aboriginal descent formed on the Islands, where it remains to the present, and many modern day Aboriginal Tasmanians trace their descent from the 19th century sealer communities of Bass Strait.

===British colonisation===

Between 1803 and 1823, there were two phases of conflict between the Aboriginal people and the British colonists. The first took place between 1803 and 1808 over the need for common food sources such as oysters and kangaroos, and the second between 1808 and 1823, when only a small number of white females lived among the colonists, and farmers, sealers and whalers took part in the trading, and the abduction, of Aboriginal women as sexual partners. These practices also increased conflict over women among Aboriginal tribes. This in turn led to a decline in the Aboriginal population. Historian Lyndall Ryan records 74 Aboriginal people (almost all women) living with sealers on the Bass Strait islands in the period up to 1835.

In 1804, the first major massacre of Aboriginal Tasmanians occurred a few months after the establishment of the first British settlements at Risdon Cove and Hobart. The 1804 Risdon Cove massacre resulted in a large number of Aboriginal people being killed after an attack by British soldiers and settlers. A boy whose parents were killed in the massacre was taken and given the name Robert Hobart May. This boy became the first Indigenous Tasmanian to have extended contact with the British colonial society.

By 1816, kidnapping of Aboriginal children for labour had become widespread. In 1814, Governor Thomas Davey issued a proclamation expressing &quot;utter indignation and abhorrence&quot; in regards to the kidnapping of the children and in 1819 Governor William Sorell not only re-issued the proclamation but ordered that those who had been taken without parental consent were to be sent to Hobart and supported at government expense. A number of young Aboriginal children were known to be living with settlers. An Irish sealer named Brien spared the life of the baby son of a native woman he had abducted, explaining, &quot;as (he) had stolen the dam he would keep the cub&quot;. When the child grew up he became an invaluable assistant to Brien but was considered &quot;no good&quot; by his own people as he was brought up to dislike Aboriginal people, whom he considered &quot;dirty lazy brutes&quot;. Twenty-six were definitely known (through baptismal records) to have been taken into settlers&#x27; homes as infants or very small children, too young to be of service as labourers. Some Aboriginal children were sent to the Orphan School in Hobart. Lyndall Ryan reports fifty-eight Aboriginal people, of various ages, living with settlers in Tasmania in the period up to 1835.

Some historians argue that European disease did not appear to be a serious factor until after 1829. Other historians including Geoffrey Blainey and Keith Windschuttle, point to introduced disease as the main cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal population. Keith Windschuttle argues that while smallpox never reached Tasmania, respiratory diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis and the effects of venereal diseases devastated the Tasmanian Aboriginal population whose long isolation from contact with the mainland compromised their resistance to introduced disease. The work of historian James Bonwick and anthropologist H. Ling Roth, both writing in the 19th century, also point to the significant role of epidemics and infertility without clear attribution of the sources of the diseases as having been introduced through contact with European, and Bonwick notes that Tasmanian Aboriginal women were infected with venereal diseases by Europeans. Introduced venereal disease not only directly caused deaths but, more insidiously, left a significant percentage of the population unable to reproduce. Josephine Flood, archaeologist, wrote: &quot;Venereal disease sterilised and chest complaints – influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis – killed.&quot;

Bonwick, who lived in Tasmania, recorded a number of reports of the devastating effect of introduced disease including one report by a Doctor Story, a Quaker, who wrote: &quot;After 1823 the women along with the tribe seemed to have had no children; but why I do not know.&quot; Later historians have reported that introduced venereal disease caused infertility amongst the Aboriginal Tasmanians. Bonwick also recorded a strong Aboriginal oral tradition of an epidemic even before formal colonisation in 1803. &quot;Mr Robert Clark, in a letter to me, said: &#x27;I have gleaned from some of the Aborigines, now in their graves, that they were more numerous than the white people were aware of, but their numbers were very much thinned by a sudden attack of disease which was general among the entire population previous to the arrival of the English, entire tribes of natives having been swept off in the course of one or two days&#x27; illness. Such an epidemic may be linked to contact with sailors or sealers.

Henry Ling Roth, an anthropologist, wrote: &quot;Calder, who has gone more fully into the particulars of their illnesses, writes as follows ...: &#x27;Their rapid declension after the colony was founded is traceable, as far as our proofs allow us to judge, to the prevalence of epidemic disorders. Roth was referring to James Erskine Calder who took up a post as a surveyor in Tasmania in 1829 and who wrote a number of scholarly papers about the Aboriginal people. &quot;According to Calder, a rapid and remarkable declension of the numbers of the Aborigines had been going on long before the remnants were gathered together on Flinders Island. Whole tribes (some of which Robinson mentions by name as being in existence fifteen or twenty years before he went amongst them, and which probably never had a shot fired at them) had absolutely and entirely vanished. To the causes to which he attributes this strange wasting away ... I think infecundity, produced by the infidelity of the women to their husbands in the early times of the colony, may be safely added ... Robinson always enumerates the sexes of the individuals he took; ... and as a general thing, found scarcely any children amongst them; ... adultness was found to outweigh infancy everywhere in a remarkable degree ...&quot;

Robinson recorded in his journals a number of comments regarding the Aboriginal Tasmanians&#x27; susceptibility to diseases, particularly respiratory diseases. In 1832 he revisited the west coast of Tasmania, far from the settled regions, and wrote: &quot;The numbers of Aborigines along the western coast have been considerably reduced since the time of my last visit [1830]. A mortality has raged amongst them which together with the severity of the season and other causes had rendered the paucity of their number very considerable.&quot;

Between 1825 and 1831 a pattern of guerilla warfare by the Aboriginal Tasmanians was identified by the colonists. Rapid pastoral expansion, a depletion of native game and an increase in the colony&#x27;s population triggered Aboriginal resistance from 1824 onwards when it has been estimated by Lyndall Ryan that 1000 Aboriginal people remained in the settled districts. Whereas settlers and stock keepers had previously provided rations to the Aboriginal people during their seasonal movements across the settled districts, and recognised this practice as some form of payment for trespass and loss of traditional hunting grounds, the new settlers and stock keepers were unwilling to maintain these arrangements and the Aboriginal people began to raid settlers&#x27; huts for food.

The official Government position was that Aboriginal people were blameless for any hostilities, but when Musquito was hanged in 1825, a significant debate was generated which split the colonists along class lines. The &quot;higher grade&quot; saw the hanging as a dangerous precedent and argued that Aboriginal people were only defending their land and should not be punished for doing so. The &quot;lower grade&quot; of colonists wanted more Aboriginal people hanged to encourage a &quot;conciliatory line of conduct&quot;. Governor Arthur sided with the &quot;lower grade&quot; and 1825 saw the first official acceptance that Aboriginal people were at least partly to blame for conflict.

In 1826 the Government gazette, which had formerly reported &quot;retaliatory actions&quot; by Aboriginal people, now reported &quot;acts of atrocity&quot; and for the first time used the terminology &quot;Aborigine&quot; instead of &quot;native&quot;. A newspaper reported that there were only two solutions to the problem: either they should be &quot;hunted down like wild beasts and destroyed&quot; or they should be removed from the settled districts. The colonial Government assigned troops to drive them out. A Royal Proclamation in 1828 established military posts on the boundaries and a further proclamation declared martial law against the Aboriginal people. As it was recognised that there were fixed routes for seasonal migration, Aboriginal people were required to have passes if they needed to cross the settled districts with bounties offered for the capture of those without passes, £5 (equivalent to about £ or AU$ in ) for an adult and £2 for children, a process that often led to organised hunts resulting in deaths. Every dispatch from Governor Arthur to the Secretary of State during this period stressed that in every case where Aboriginal people had been killed it was colonists that initiated hostilities.
Though many Aboriginal deaths went unrecorded, the Cape Grim massacre in 1828 demonstrates the level of frontier violence towards Aboriginal Tasmanians.

The Black War of 1828–1832 and the Black Line of 1830 were turning points in the relationship with European settlers. Even though many of the Aboriginal people managed to avoid capture during these events, they were shaken by the size of the campaigns against them, and this brought them to a position whereby they were willing to surrender to Robinson and move to Flinders Island.

====Aboriginal Tasmanians and settlers mentioned in literature 1800–1835====
European and Aboriginal casualties, including the Aboriginal residents who were captured, may be considered as reasonably accurate. The figures for the Aboriginal population shot is likely a substantial undercount.
====Resettlement of the Aboriginal population====
In late 1831, Robinson brought the first 51 Aboriginal people to a settlement on Flinders Island named The Lagoons, which turned out to be inadequate as it was exposed to gales, had little water and no land suitable for cultivation.
Supplies to the settlement were inadequate and if sealers had not supplied potatoes, the Aboriginal people would have starved. The Europeans were living on oatmeal and potatoes while the Aboriginal people, who detested oatmeal and refused to eat it, survived on potatoes and rice supplemented by mutton birds they caught. Within months 31 Aboriginal people had died. Roth wrote:

By January 1832 a further 44 captured Aboriginal residents had arrived and conflicts arose between the tribal groups. To defuse the situation, Sergeant Wight took the Big River group to Green Island, where they were abandoned, and he later decided to move the rest to Green Island as well. Two weeks later Robinson arrived with Lieutenant Darling, the new commander for the station, and moved the Aboriginal people back to The Lagoons. Darling ensured a supply of plentiful food and permitted &quot;hunting excursions&quot;. In October 1832, it was decided to build a new camp with better buildings (wattle and daub) at a more suitable location, Pea Jacket Point. Pea Jacket Point was renamed Civilisation Point but became more commonly known as the Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment. Wybalenna in the Ben Lomond language meant &quot;dwellings&quot; but is generally translated as &quot;black man&#x27;s houses&quot;.
Robinson befriended Truganini, learned some of the local language and in 1833 managed to persuade the remaining 154 &quot;full-blooded&quot; people to move to the new settlement on Flinders Island, where he promised a modern and comfortable environment, and that they would be returned to their former homes on the Tasmanian mainland as soon as possible. At the Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment on Flinders Island, described by historian Henry Reynolds as the &quot;best equipped and most lavishly staffed Aboriginal institution in the Australian colonies in the nineteenth century&quot;, they were provided with housing, clothing, rations of food, the services of a doctor and educational facilities. Convicts were assigned to build housing and do most of the work at the settlement including the growing of food in the vegetable gardens. After arrival, all Aboriginal children aged between six and 15 years were removed from their families to be brought up by the storekeeper and a lay preacher. The Aboriginal people were free to roam the island and were often absent from the settlement for extended periods on hunting trips as the rations supplied turned out to be inadequate. By 1835 the living conditions had deteriorated to the extent that in October Robinson personally took charge of Wybalenna, organising better food and improving the housing. However, of the 220 who arrived with Robinson, most died in the following 14 years from introduced disease and inadequate shelter. As a result of their loss of freedom, the birth rate was extremely low and few children survived infancy.
In 1839, Governor Franklin appointed a board to inquire into the conditions at Wybalenna that rejected Robinson&#x27;s claims regarding improved living conditions and found the settlement to be a failure. The report was never released and the government continued to promote Wybalenna as a success in the treatment of Aboriginal people. In March 1847 six Aboriginal people at Wybalenna presented a petition to Queen Victoria, the first petition to a reigning monarch from any Aboriginal group in Australia, requesting that the promises made to them be honoured. In October 1847, the 47 survivors were transferred to their final settlement at Oyster Cove station. Only 44 survived the trip (11 couples, 12 single men and 10 children) and the children were immediately sent to the orphan school in Hobart. Although the housing and food was better than Wybalenna, the station was a former convict station that had been abandoned earlier that year due to health issues as it was located on inadequately drained mudflats. According to the guards, the Aboriginal people developed &quot;too much independence&quot; by trying to continue their culture which they considered &quot;recklessness&quot; and &quot;rank ingratitude&quot;. Their numbers continued to diminish, being estimated in 1859 at around a dozen and, by 1869, there was only one, who died in 1876.

Commenting in 1899 on Robinson&#x27;s claims of success, anthropologist Henry Ling Roth wrote:

==== Anthropological interest ====

The Oyster Cove people attracted contemporaneous international scientific interest from the 1860s onwards, with many museums claiming body parts for their collections. Scientists were interested in studying Aboriginal Tasmanians from a physical anthropology perspective, hoping to gain insights into the field of paleoanthropology. For these reasons, they were interested in individual Aboriginal body parts and whole skeletons.

Tasmanian Aboriginal skulls were particularly sought internationally for studies into craniofacial anthropometry. Truganini herself entertained fears that her body might be exploited after her death and two years after her death her body was exhumed and sent to Melbourne for scientific study. Her skeleton was then put up for public display in the Tasmanian Museum until 1947, and was only laid to rest, by cremation, in 1976. Another case was the removal of the skull and scrotum – for a tobacco pouch – of William Lanne, known as King Billy, on his death in 1869.

However, many of these skeletons were obtained from Aboriginal &quot;mummies&quot; from graves or bodies of the murdered. Amalie Dietrich for example became famous for delivering such specimens.

Aboriginal people have considered the dispersal of body parts as being disrespectful, as a common aspect within Aboriginal belief systems is that a soul can only be at rest when laid in its homeland.

=== 20th century to present ===

Body parts and ornaments are still being returned from collections today, with the Royal College of Surgeons of England returning samples of Truganini&#x27;s skin and hair (in 2002), and the British Museum returning ashes to two descendants in 2007.

During the 20th century, the absence of Aboriginal people of solely Aboriginal ancestry, and a general unawareness of the surviving populations, meant many non-Aboriginal people assumed they were extinct, after the death of Truganini in 1876. Since the mid-1970s Tasmanian Aboriginal activists such as Michael Mansell have sought to broaden awareness and identification of Aboriginal descent. After campaigning by Tasmanian Aboriginal people in April 2023 UNESCO removed a document claiming they were extinct.

A dispute exists within the Tasmanian Aboriginal community, however, over what constitutes Aboriginality. The Palawa, mainly descendants of white male sealers and Tasmanian Aboriginal women who settled on the Bass Strait Islands, were given the power to decide who is of Tasmanian Aboriginal descent at the state level (entitlement to government Aboriginal services). Palawa recognise only descendants of the Bass Strait Island community as Aboriginal and do not consider as Aboriginal the Lia Pootah, who claim descent, based on oral traditions, from Tasmanian mainland Aboriginal communities. The Lia Pootah feel that the Palawa controlled Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre does not represent them politically.
Since 2007 there have been initiatives to introduce DNA testing to establish family history in descendant subgroups. This is strongly opposed by the Palawa and has drawn an angry reaction from some quarters, as some have claimed &quot;spiritual connection&quot; with Aboriginality distinct from, but not as important as the existence of a genetic link. The Lia Pootah object to the current test used to prove Aboriginality as they believe it favours the Palawa, a DNA test would circumvent barriers to Lia Pootah recognition, or disprove their claims to Aboriginality.

In April 2000, the Tasmanian Government &quot;Legislative Council Select Committee on Aboriginal Lands&quot; discussed the difficulty of determining Aboriginality based on oral traditions. An example given by Prof. Cassandra Pybus was the claim by the Huon and Channel Aboriginal people who had an oral history of descent from two Aboriginal women. Research found that both were non-Aboriginal convict women.

The Tasmanian Palawa Aboriginal community is making an effort to reconstruct and reintroduce a Tasmanian language, called palawa kani out of the various records on Tasmanian languages. Other Tasmanian Aboriginal communities use words from traditional Tasmanian languages, according to the language area they were born or live in.

==Nations==

The social organisation of Aboriginal Tasmanians had at least two hierarchies: the domestic unit or family group and the social unit or clan – which had a self-defining name with 40 to 50 people. It is contentious whether there was a larger political organisation, hitherto described as a &quot;tribe&quot; in the literature (and by colonial observers), as there is no evidence in the historical literature of larger political entities above that of the clan. Robinson, who gathered ethnographic data in the early 1800s, described Aboriginal political groups at the clan level only. Nevertheless, clans that shared a geographic region and language group are now usually classified by modern ethnographers, and the Palawa, as a nation.

Estimates made of the combined population of Aboriginal people of Tasmania, before European arrival in Tasmania, are in the range of 3,000 to 15,000 people. Genetic studies have suggested much higher figures which is supported by oral traditions that Aboriginal people were &quot;more numerous than the white people were aware of&quot; but that their population had been greatly reduced by a sudden outbreak of disease before 1803. It is speculated that early contacts with sealers before colonisation had resulted in an epidemic. Using archaeological evidence, Stockton (I983:68) estimated 3,000 to 6,000 for the northern half of the west coast alone, or up to six times the commonly accepted estimate, however he later revised this to 3,000 to 5,000 for the entire island, based on historical sources. The low rate of genetic drift indicates that Stockton&#x27;s original maximum estimate is likely the lower boundary and, while not indicated by the archaeological record, a population as high as 100,000 can &quot;not be rejected out of hand&quot;. This is supported by carrying capacity data indicating greater resource productivity in Tasmania than the mainland.

Aboriginal Tasmanians were primarily nomadic people who lived in adjoining territories, moving based on seasonal changes in food supplies such as seafood, land mammals and native vegetables and berries. They socialised, intermarried and fought &quot;wars&quot; against other clans.

According to Ryan, the population of Tasmania was aligned into nine nations composed of six to fifteen clans each, with each clan comprising two to six extended family units who were relations. Individual clans ranged over a defined nation boundary with elaborate rites of entry required of visitors.

There were more than 60 clans before European colonisation, although only 48 have been located and associated with particular territories.
The location and migratory patterns discussed below come from the work of Jones (cited in Tindale). Ryan used Jones&#x27; work in her seminal history of Aboriginal Tasmanians but Taylor discusses in his thesis how Jones&#x27; original work is uncited and possibly conjectural. Moreover, Jones published his work without recourse to Plomley&#x27;s later extensive descriptions of Tasmanian Aboriginal clan groups. Given this, the clan boundaries and nomadic patterns discussed below should be taken with caution unless referenced from primary documents.

===Oyster Bay (Paredarerme)===
The Paredarerme was estimated to be the largest Tasmanian nation with ten clans totalling 700 to 800 people. The members of the Paredarerme nation had good relations with the Big River nation, with large congregations at favoured hunting sites inland and at the coast. Relations with the North Midlands nation were mostly hostile, and evidence suggests that the Douglas-Apsley region may have been a dangerous borderland rarely visited (Ferguson 1986 p. 22). Generally, the clans of the Paredarerme ranged inland to the High Country for spring and summer and returned to the coast for autumn and winter, but not all people left their territory each year with some deciding to stay by the coast. Migrations provided a varied diet with plentiful seafood, seals and birds on the coast, and good hunting for kangaroos, wallabies and possums inland. The High Country also provided opportunities to trade for ochre with the North-west and North people, and to harvest intoxicating gum from &quot;Eucalyptus gunnii&quot;, found only on the plateau. The key determinant of camp sites was topography. The majority of camps were along river valleys, adjacent north facing hill slopes and on gentle slopes bordering a forest or marsh (Brown 1986).

===North East===
The North East nation consisted of seven clans totalling around 500 people. They had good relations with the Ben Lomond nation - granted seasonal access to the resources of the north-east coast.
===North===
The Northern nation consisted of four clans totalling 200–300 people. Their country contained the most important ochre mines in Tasmania, accessed by well defined roads kept open by firing. They traded the ochre with nearby clanspeople. They would spend part of the year in the country of the North West nation to hunt seals and collect shells from Robbins Island for necklaces. In return, the North West nation had free access to the ochre mines Relatively isolated, the region was first explored by Europeans in 1824 with the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company being given a grant of , which included the greater part of the clan hunting grounds. The settlement was a failure, with the inland areas described as &quot;wet, cold and soggy&quot;, while the coastal region was difficult to clear, as Superintendent Henry Hellyer noted the &quot;forest [was] altogether unlike anything I have seen in the Island&quot;. However, in 1827 a port was established at Emu Bay. In 1828 Tarerenorerer (English name: Walyer), a woman who had escaped from sealers, became the leader of the Emu Bay people and attacked the settlers with stolen weapons, the first recorded use of muskets by Aboriginal people.
===Big River===
The Big River nation numbered 400–500 people consisting of five clans. Little is known of their seasonal movements although it is believed that four of the five clans moved through Oyster Bay territory along the Derwent River to reach their coastal camps near Pitt Water. The Oyster Bay People had reciprocal movement rights through Big River territory.

===North Midlands===
The North Midlands nation occupied the Midland plains, a major geographical area formed in a horst and graben valley which was also subject to previous major freshwater lacustrine inundation.
The result being a relatively flat and fertile landscape that supported a large biomass, thus being a major food source for the Aboriginal peoples.
The North Midlands nation is likely to have consisted of several clans but there are three accepted major clan divisions described in the ethnographic literature today. The total population of the North Midlands nation has been estimated to be between 300 and 500 and, although migratory, the archeological and historical record infers seasonal residency in locations adjacent to permanent water sources in the Midlands valley.

====Boundaries====
The North Midlands nation was circumscribed by the geographical constraints of the Midlands valley. To the west the nation was bounded by the escarpment of the Great Western Tiers, to the north-east the boundaries are less certain; with the eastern Tamar appearing to have been occupied by the Letteremairrener as far east as Piper&#x27;s River: where the Poremairrenerner clan of the North-east nation were resident.
The occupation of the western Tamar is open to dispute – the ethnographic record suggests that it was the province of the Pallitorre and Parnillerpanner clans of the North nation; or the Leterrmairrener; or a hitherto unnamed clan of the North Midlands nation. It is likely that the west Tamar valley, or the Meander river valley formed the NNW boundaries of the North Midlands nation – with the arc of highlands formed by Cluan Tier and Dry&#x27;s Bluff forming the nor-western extremity of their country.
To the east the natural boundary was the South-Esk River and, running northwards, the high tier of Mts Barrow, Arthur and Tippogoree Hills: beyond which lay the North-east nation. Running south past the eastern bend of the South-Esk it appears that the North Midlands Nation held land to some extent along the south bank of the Esk, at least as far as Avoca and possibly as far as the natural boundary of the St Pauls River, beyond which the Oyster Bay nation were resident.
To the south their country was constrained by the uplands beyond Tunbridge, as the plains narrow towards Big River and Oyster Bay country.

====Language====
The North Midlands language is classified as &quot;mairremenner&quot; and was spoken by the Ben Lomond and North-east nations and also the Luggermairrenerpairer clan of the Central Highlands. This language group is likely to be a derivation of three other Tasmanian languages.

====Clans====
Three major national divisions are generally ascribed to the North Midlands nation, although it is likely that more clans existed and Ryan (2012) asserts the possibility of another two clan territories. What is known of the composition of the North Midlands nation derives from settler description (who ascribed simple tribal divisions based upon locality), direct attribution from contemporary Aboriginal Tasmanians (recorded by Robinson collated by Plomley) and later research by Rhys Jones. From this we can be certain that there were three major clan divisions, described by colonials as the Port Dalrymple tribe (Leterrermairrener clan), at the Tamar River; Pennyroyal Creek tribe (Panninher), at Norfolk Plains; and the Stony Creek tribe (Tyrrernotepanner), at Campbell Town.

=====Letteremairrener &quot;Port Dalrymple&quot; clan=====
The Letteremairrener (Letter-ramare-ru-nah) clan occupied country from Low Head to modern day Launceston. In colonial times reports were made of clusters of huts, up to ten in number, in the Tamar valley and there are extensive archeological remains of occupation on both sides of the Tamar river and north coastal country.

======Toponymy======
Little is recorded of the toponymy of their country but some local placenames have survived and are likely to be of the &quot;Nara&quot; language group.
* Tamar River: kunermurluker, morerutter, ponrabbel
* Low Head: Pilerwaytackenter
* Georgetown area: Kennemerthertackenloongentare
* Launceston (Port Dalrymple): Taggener, Lorernulraytitteter
* North-Esk River: Lakekeller
* Mt Barrow: Pialermaligena

======Significant sites======
Little is known of specific sites of significance to the Letteremairrener, but contemporary Palawa assert the significance of the Cataract Gorge
as a place of ceremony and significance. Certainly, in 1847, when a surviving Aboriginal &quot;chief&quot; was temporarily returned to Launceston from exile in Wybalenna, he requested to be taken to the Cataract Gorge and was described as being jubilant at return to the Gorge, followed with apparent lamentation at what had been lost to him.
There are no recorded significant archeological remains in the Gorge precinct, although the area was subject to significant seasonal flooding before damming.

The Letteremairrener had been recorded to have specific meeting places at Paterson&#x27;s Plains (near modern-day St Leonards) and groups as large as 150 had been recorded in colonial times in this vicinity. The clan country overlapped with that of the Panninher and Tyrrernotepanner and it is likely that, at times, the clans shared resources across clan borders.

======Colonial contact======
The Letteremairrener were among the first Aboriginal peoples to be affected by the impact of colonisation by the British as colonial occupation commenced at Port Dalrymple and progressed to Launceston, with settlers progressively occupying land up the Tamar valley.
By the early 1800s the Letteremairrener had been involved in skirmishes with exploratory parties of colonials, in the second decade of that century they had reached some accommodation with the interlopers; and were observed practising spear throwing near present-day Paterson Barracks and watching colonial women wash clothes at Cataract Gorge.
Between 1811 and 1827 several Aboriginal children were baptised in Launceston, either abducted or the progeny of settler/Aboriginal liaisons. By 1830 the people of the Letteremairenner had largely disappeared from their homeland and the survivors were waging a desperate guerrilla war with colonial British, living a fringe existence in Launceston or living life on the margin at the peripheries of their traditional land.
By 1837 the Letteremairrenner had disappeared completely from the Tamar Valley and would eventually die in the squalor of Wybalenna or Oyster Cove.

=====Panninher &quot;Pennyroyal Creek&quot; clan=====
The Panninher (parn-in-her) were known to colonial people as the Penny Royal Creek tribe, named eponymously from the river that comes off the Western Tiers south of Drys Bluff (which is now called the Liffey River). The Panninher named the Liffey river &quot;tellerpanger&quot; and Drys Bluff, the mountain rearing above their homeland, was &quot;taytitkekitheker&quot;. Their territory broadly covered the north plains of the midlands from the west bank of the Tamar River across to what is now Evandale and terminating at the Tyerrernotepanner country around modern day Conara.

The Panninher also freely moved from the Tamar to the central highlands and brokered trade in ochre from the Toolumbunner mine to neighbouring clans.
Robinson describes the road used by the Panninher from their home up to the Central Highlands, via the gully of the Liffey river, and the South road along the base of the Western Tiers – up the Lake River to modern day Interlaken.

======Significant sites======
Whilst sites of ritual significance to the Panninher are not known, the Panninher were known to frequent Native Point, on the South Esk River between modern day Perth and Evandale, where flint quarries were located and clans met for celebration. Here local historians believe that cemetery (hollowed) trees were used to inter the dead.
Similarly, Reibey&#x27;s Ford, near modern-day Hadspen, was a known &quot;resort of the natives&quot; and they named this site &quot;moorronnoe&quot;. Archaeological evidence shows also indicates signs of continuous occupation at permanent lagoons near Cleveland, which was known historically as a clan meeting place.

The Panninher were affected early by settlement around Norfolk Plains and aggressive assertion of property rights by settlers at first hindered their hunting and migration through their country and, subsequently, led to outright hostility from both parties. Captain Ritchie, an early settler near Perth, tolerated, or fostered, forays by his assigned men against the Panninher and this culminated in a massacre by settlers near modern-day Cressy.
The Panninher, or their neighbouring clansmen, retaliated in various attacks against settlers at Western Lagoon and in remote country up the Lake River, reaching a peak in aggression against the colonial interlopers by 1827.
In 1831 a war party of &quot;100 or 150 stout men&quot; attacked settlers at the base of the Western Tiers and up the Lake River but it is unclear whether this was the action of the Panninher alone or a confederation of warriors from remnant North Tasmanian nations. The colonial settlers made little discrimination between Panninher and members of the &quot;Stony Creek tribe&quot; and it is likely that the North Midlands nation had disintegrated and the amalgamated band was known under the overarching name of &quot;Stony Creek tribe&quot; by this time. This notwithstanding, it seems that the Panninher were resourceful enough to survive in some numbers until late in the Black War.

=====The Tyerrernotepanner &quot;Stony Creek&quot; clan=====
The Tyerrernotepanner (Chera-noti-pana) were known to colonial people as the Stony Creek tribe, named eponymously from the small southern tributary of the South Esk at Llewellyn, west of modern-day Avoca.

The clan Tyerrernotepanner were centred at Campbell Town and were one of up to four clans in the south central Midlands area.
Nevertheless, this clan name is now used as a general term for all Aboriginal peoples of this region. The ethnographic and archaeological evidence describes areas of significance to the south central Midlands clans: modern day Lake Leake, Tooms Lake, Windfalls farm, Mt Morriston, Ross township and the lacustrine regions of the midlands all show evidence of tool knapping, middens and records of hut construction consistent with occupation.

===== Significant sites =====
Lake Leake (previously Kearney&#x27;s Bogs), Campbell Town, Ellinthorpe Plains (near modern day Auburn) and Tooms Lake were described as &quot;resorts of the natives&quot; by settlers and showed substantial evidence of seasonal occupation. Furthermore, several small lagoons in the midlands area all show substantial archeological evidence of regular occupation consistent with tool-making and semi-nomadic use. Aboriginal roads, &quot;markenner&quot;, are described as passing up the Eastern Tiers to Swanport, up the Western Tier to Interlaken and up the Lake River to Woods Lake and thence to the Central Highlands.

The clan divisions of the southern central Midlands are suggested below. Caution must be exercised as to the provenance of the names and the complete accuracy of attributing discrete geographical regions.
* &quot;Tyrrernotepanner&quot;: clan at Northern Campbell Town/Lake river/ South Fingal Valley
* &quot;Marwemairer&quot;: clan at Ross/Mt Morriston region
* &quot;Peenrymairmener&quot;: clan at Glen Morriston/Lake Leake
* &quot;Polemairre&quot;: clan at Tunbridge area

The Tyerrernotepanner are described consistently in contemporary records as a &quot;fierce tribe&quot; and the records describe consistent and concerted violence by the Tyerrernotepanner during the Black War. The Tyeerrernotepanner, along with clansmen from other remnant tribes, conducted raids across the midlands during the Black War and, until &quot;conciliated&quot; by Robinson, were the subject of fearful reminiscence by colonial people.
The famed Aboriginal leader Umarrah was a member of this clan and he was noted for his aggression and sustained campaign against European interlopers - although he was raised by colonials himself.

===Ben Lomond===
The Ben Lomond nation consisted of at least three clans totalling 150–200 people. They occupied the 260 km of country surrounding the Ben Lomond plateau. Three clan names are known but their locations are somewhat conjectural – the clans were recorded as Plangermaireener, Plindermairhemener and Tonenerweenerlarmenne.

The Plangermaireener clan is recorded as variously inhabiting the south-east aspect of the Ben Lomond region and also has been associated with the Oyster Bay or Cape Portland clans to the east; indeed, the chief Mannalargenna is variously described as a chief of the Oyster Bay, Cape Portland and Ben Lomond nations.
Plangermaireener is also used as a blanket term for the Ben Lomond nation, which reflects the suffix &quot;mairreener&quot;; meaning &quot;people&quot;.

The Plindermairhemener are recorded in association with the south and south-western aspects of the region and the location of the Tonenerweenerlarmenne is uncertain, but were probably centred in the remaining Ben Lomond nation territory from White Hills to the headwaters of the North and South-Esk rivers or the upper South-Esk Valley.
This notwithstanding, the Palawa were a nomadic people and likely occupied these lands seasonally.

The Ben Lomond nation is sometimes described as the Ben Lomond/Pennyroyal Creek nation from an entry in Robinson&#x27;s journal:
&quot;(Mannalargenna) ... said that &#x27;the smoke...was that of the Ben Lomond-Pennyroyal Creek natives. This is a misnomer, as the Pennyroyal Creek was the original European name for the Liffey River and the Pennyroyal Creek tribe was the contemporary name of the Panninher clan of the North Midlands nation.
Mannalargenna would be familiar with the clans neighbouring his own traditional country and could be relied upon to report accurately the composition of the clanspeople in question. It is plausible that when Robinson was writing in 1830 the remnant peoples of the Ben Lomond nation had federated with that of the Panninher and this was the provenance of the conjoined title.

====Seasonal movement====
The clans of the Ben Lomond nation were nomadic, and the Aboriginal residents hunted along the valleys of the South Esk and North Esk rivers, their tributaries and the highlands to the northeast; as well as making forays to the plateau in summer. There are records of Aboriginal huts or dwellings around the foothills of Stacks Bluff and around the headwaters of the South Esk River near modern-day Mathinna. On the plateau there is evidence of artifacts around Lake Youl that suggests regular occupation of this site by Aboriginal peoples after the last ice age. The clans of the Ben Lomond nation had close enough relationships with neighbouring clans of the East Coast and North Midlands that they enjoyed seasonal foraging rights to these adjoining territories. John Batman describes the seasonal movement of the Plangermaireener in his diary of May 1830:

Batman further describes the relationship between the clans of the Ben Lomond nation and the North East nation:

===North West===
The North West nation numbered between 400 and 600 people at time of contact with Europeans and had at least eight clans. They had good relations with the North nation, who were allowed access to the resources of the north-west coast. First explored by Europeans in 1824, the region was considered inhospitable and only lightly settled, although it suffered a high rate of Aboriginal dispossession and killings.

===South West Coast===
===South East===
Risdon Cove, the first Tasmanian settlement, was located in south-east country. There is eyewitness evidence that the South East nation may have consisted of up to ten clans, totalling around 500 people. However, only four groups totalling 160–200 people were officially recorded as the main source by Robinson, whose journals begin in 1829. By this time, Europeans had settled in most of the South East tribe&#x27;s country, with the country dispossessed and food resources depleted. Their country contained the most important silcrete, chert and quartzite mines in Tasmania.
The South East people had a hostile relationship with the Oyster Bay people whom they frequently raided, often to kidnap women.
Truganini was a Nuenonne from Bruny Island, which they called &quot;Lunawanna-Alonnah&quot;. The first two European towns built on the island were named Lunawanna and Alonnah, and most of the island&#x27;s landmarks are named after Nuenonne people. The island was the source of the sandstone used to build many of Melbourne&#x27;s buildings, such as the Post Office and Parliament House.

==Culture==

Aboriginal culture was disrupted severely in the 19th century after dispossession of land and incarceration of Aboriginal people on Wybalenna and Oyster Cove. Much traditional knowledge has irrevocably disappeared and what remains has been nurtured over several generations starting with the Aboriginal wives of sealers on the Furneaux Islands.

But, as the Aboriginal writer Greg Lehman states, &quot;Aboriginal culture (is not) past tense.&quot; Aboriginal people, in a variety of forms, continue to express their culture in unique ways – expressing themes that lament the past but also celebrate endurance and continuity of culture into the future.

===Pre-colonial contact===
Contemporary accounts of the ceremonial and cultural life of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people are very limited. There were no observers trained in the social sciences after the French expeditions in the 18th century had made formal study of Tasmanian Aboriginal culture. Moreover, those who wrote most comprehensively of Aboriginal life in the 19th century did so after colonial contact, and the ensuing violence and dislocation, had irrevocably altered traditional Aboriginal culture. Those that most closely observed Aboriginal cultural practices either did not write accounts of what they observed or, if they did, observed culture through the ethnocentric lens of religious and proselytising 19th century European men.

==== Mythology ====
The mythology of the Aboriginal Tasmanians appears to be complex and possibly specific to each clan group. One of their creation myths refers to two creator deities, Moinee and Droemerdene; the children of Parnuen, the sun, and Vena, the moon.

Moinee appears as the primeval creator, forming the land and rivers of Tasmania and fashioning the first man, Parlevar – embodied from a spirit residing in the ground. This form was similar to a kangaroo, and Aboriginal people consequently take the kangaroo as a totem. Similarly, Moinee then created the kangaroo, who emerged, like the first man, from the soil.

Droemerdene appears as the star Canopus who helped the first men to change from their kangaroo-like form. He removed their tails and fashioned their knee joints &quot;so that they could rest&quot; and thus man achieved differentiation form the kangaroo.

Moinee fought with his brother Droemerdene, and many &quot;devils&quot;, after Droemerdene changed the shape of the first men and Moinee was finally hurled to his death from the sky to take form as a standing stone at Cox Bight. Droemerdene subsequently fell into the sea at Louisa Bay.
Toogee Low (Port Davey) remained in mythology as a residence of many &quot;devils&quot;.

Tasmanian Aboriginal mythology also records in their oral history that the first men emigrated by land from a far-off country and the land was subsequently flooded – an echo of the Tasmanian people&#x27;s migration from mainland Australia to (then) peninsular Tasmania, and the submergence of the land bridge after the last ice age.

==== Spirituality ====
Little has been recorded of traditional Tasmanian Aboriginal spiritual life. Colonial British recorded that Aboriginal people describe topographical features, such as valleys and caves, as being inhabited by spiritual entities recorded by contemporaries as &quot;sprites&quot;. Furthermore, Robinson recorded members of some clans as having animistic regard for certain species of tree within their domain.
Robinson recorded several discussions regarding spiritual entities that his companions describe as having agency or a source of interpretive power to aid their navigation of their physical world. Tasmanian Aboriginal people would describe these entities as &quot;devils&quot; and related that these spiritual beings as walking alongside Aboriginal people &quot;carrying a torch but could not be seen&quot;.

Mannarlargenna, in particular, described consulting his &quot;devil&quot; which seems to be a resident personal spirituality that provided prognostic or oracular powers.
The &quot;devil&quot; might also be used to describe malevolent spiritual entities in the Aboriginal cosmos.

Aboriginal people recounted that there was a prime malevolent spirit called &quot;rageowrapper&quot;, who appeared as a large black (Aboriginal?) man and is associated with the darkness. &quot;Rageowrapper&quot; might appear borne on a strong wind or be the source of severe illness;
this malign spirit might be released from a sick individual by cutting the skin to &quot;let him out&quot;.

Several researchers assert that there was belief in a kind of manichaean cosmos with a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; spirit – delineated by day and night – although this may reflect the cultural bias of the observers. Milligan (a contemporary at Wyballenna) described a creator spirit called &quot;tiggana marrabona&quot; – translating as &quot;twilight man&quot; but as referred to above there are a number of supernatural beings associated with creation.

Etymological study of Milligan&#x27;s ethnographic data describes a pantheon of spiritual beings associated with environmental or supernatural phenomena:
* &quot;nama burag&quot; – or &quot;the ghost of the thunderstorm&quot;
* &quot;ragi roba&quot; – (see rageowrapper) the &quot;revered spirit&quot; – frequently connoted to awesome/revered/dreaded and a signifier of ghosts/phantoms of the departed when connected with signifier &quot;ragi&quot;
* &quot;laga robana&quot; – &quot;awful spirit of the dead&quot; i.e. the dead man, some kind of dreaded spirit, malevolent phantom
* &quot;maian ginja&quot; – &quot;the killer&quot; – translates also to fiend/demon: bringer of death
* &quot;muran bugana luwana&quot; – &quot;the bright spirit of the night&quot; – a kind of benign or ebullient entity, often described of female form &quot;clothed in grass&quot;
* &quot;wara wana&quot; – &quot;the spirit being&quot; – also &quot;warrawah&quot; translates to transcendental/ethereal/spirit of dead associated with celestial bodies- may be malevolent
* &quot;badenala&quot; – &quot;shadow man&quot; – ghost or spirit
* &quot;kana tana&quot; – &quot;the bone man&quot; – Western Nation language term for spirit of the dead
* &quot;nangina&quot; – &quot;shadow/ghost&quot; – contemporary association with &quot;fairy&quot; or &quot;elf&quot; – a supernatural entity dwelling &quot;in the hill – dancing (and) fond of children&quot;
* &quot;buga nubrana&quot; – &quot;the man&#x27;s eye&quot; – associated with the sun – possibly a benign entity

Traditional Aboriginal Tasmanians also related beliefs of a spiritual afterlife. One such belief, related by an Aboriginal person from the west coastal nation, was that the spirit of the dead travelled to a place over the sea: to the far north-west, called &quot;Moo-ai&quot;. This possibly reflects the ancestral memory of the &quot;Mara&quot; language group, resident in Western Tasmania, who are believed to have settled Tasmania from the Warrnambool region in modern day Victoria, but other Tasmanians state that after death their spirits would have a post-corporeal existence in their traditional lands. Other references are made to an Island of the Dead, &quot;tini drini&quot;, described as &quot;an island in Bass Strait&quot; where the dead would be reincarnated or &quot;jump up white men&quot;. White here does not refer to European, but rather the skeletal or phantasmic nature of returned dead.

==== Funeral customs ====
The dead might be cremated or interred in a hollow tree or rock grave, dependent on clan custom.
Aboriginal people were also recorded to keep bones of dead people as talismans or amulets. The bones might be worn on a kangaroo sinew string bare around the neck or enclosed in a kangaroo skin bag.

==== Cosmology ====
Traditional Aboriginal Tasmanians saw the night sky as residence of creator spirits (see above) and also describe constellations that represent tribal life; such as figures of fighting men and courting couples.

=== Material culture ===
==== Use of fire ====
Tasmanian Aboriginal peoples used bark wrapping to protect fire-starting coals from Tasmania&#x27;s wet maritime climate. When their last coal was extinguished, they would ask fire from neighbouring hearths or clans, but also probably used friction fire-starting methods and possibly mineral percussion, despite claims that the native Tasmanians had &quot;lost&quot; the ability to make fire. Tasmanian Aboriginal people extensively employed fire for cooking, warmth, tool hardening and clearing vegetation to encourage and control macropod herds. This management may have caused the buttongrass plains in southwest Tasmania to develop to their current extent.

==== Hunting and diet ====
Approximately 4,000 years ago, Aboriginal Tasmanians largely dropped scaled fish from their diet, and began eating more land mammals, such as possums, kangaroos, and wallabies. Aboriginal Tasmanians had employed bone tools, but it appears that they switched from worked bone tools to more efficient sharpened stone tools. The significance of the disappearance of bone tools (believed to have been primarily used for fishing) and fish in the diet is heavily debated. Some argue that it is evidence of a maladaptive society, while others argue that the change was economical, as large areas of scrub at that time were changing to grassland, providing substantially increased food resources. Fish were never a large part of the diet, ranking behind shellfish and seals, and with more resources available, the cost/benefit ratio of fishing may have become too high.
Archaeological evidence indicates that around the time these changes took place, the Tasmanian people began expanding their territories, a process that was still continuing when Europeans arrived.

==== Basket making ====
Basket making is a traditional craft which has been developed into contemporary art. Baskets had many uses, including carrying food, tools, shells, ochre, and eating utensils. Basket-like carriers were made from plant materials, kelp, or animal skin. The kelp baskets or carriers were used mainly to carry and serve water.

Plants were carefully selected to produce strong, thin, narrow strips of fibre of suitable length for basket making. Several different species of plant were used, including white flag iris, blue flax lily, rush and sag, some of which are still used by contemporary basket makers, and sometimes shells are added for ornament.

====Shell necklace art====
Making necklaces from shells is a significant cultural tradition among Tasmanian Aboriginal women.
Necklaces were used for adornment, as gifts and tokens of honour, and as trading objects. Dating back at least 2,600 years, necklace-making is one of the few Palawa traditions that has remained intact and has continued without interruption since before European settlement. A number of shell necklaces are held in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.

The necklaces were initially only made out of the shells of the &quot;Phasianotrochus irisodontes&quot; snail, commonly known as the rainbow kelp and usually referred to as maireener shells. There are three other species of maireeners found in Tasmanian waters. In the past 20 years, there has been a decline in the number of shells, since the decline in kelp and seaweed growth around Flinders Island, Cape Barren and Big Dog islands due to climate change, which has led to erosion of the sea bed.

==== Ochre ====
Ochre is highly significant in Tasmanian Aboriginal culture. Tasmanian ochre ranges in colour from white through yellow to red. Its uses include ceremonial body marking, colouring wood craft products, tie-dyeing, and other crafts and arts.

Traditionally, Aboriginal women had the exclusive role of obtaining ochre, and many Tasmanian Aboriginal men continue to respect this custom by obtaining ochre only from women. Though ochre is mined from sites throughout Tasmania, the most celebrated source is Toolumbunner in the Gog Range of NW Tasmania, in the traditional lands of the Pallitorre clan. This was also a significant site of tribal meeting, celebration and trading.

==== Ceremony ====
Colonial settlers describe various traditional ceremonies of Aboriginal people. One has been called &quot;corobery&quot;, although that is a mainland Aboriginal word adopted by British settlers. Ceremonial dance and singing depicted traditional tales as well as recent events.
Robinson describes &quot;horse-dance&quot; depicting a horseman hunting an Aboriginal person, as well as the sensual &quot;devil-dance&quot; performed by women from the Furneaux islands.

Battles and funerals were also occasions for painting the body with ochre or black paint. At the funeral of an Aboriginal man named &quot;Robert&quot; in Launceston, an Aboriginal mourner was asked the meaning of his body paint, and replied &quot;what do you wear fine clothes for?&quot;

==== Visual art ====
Contemporary colonial settlers relate several examples of pictorial art drawn on the insides of huts or on remnants of discarded paper. These designs are generally circular or spiral motifs that represent celestial bodies or figures of clans-people. Robinson related that one design in an Aboriginal hut was very accurately drawn and was created via the use of a kind of wooden compass.

The most enduring art form left by Tasmanians are petroglyphs, or rock art. The most elaborate site is at Preminghana on the West Coast, although other significant sites exist at the Bluff in Devonport and at Greenes Creek. Smaller sites include the cupules at &quot;meenamatta&quot; Blue Tier and isolated circle motifs at Trial Harbour.

Aboriginal people inhabited Tasmania&#x27;s South-west from the last glacial maximum and hand stencils and ochre smears are found in several caves, the oldest of which is dated to 10000 years ago.
=== Modern culture ===
==== Visual art ====
Tasmanian Aboriginal people are asserting their identity and culture through the visual arts. The art expresses the Aboriginal viewpoint on colonial history, race relations and identity. Themes consistent in modern Tasmanian Aboriginal art are loss, kinship, narratives of dispossession but also survival. The art is modern, using textiles, sculpture and photography but often incorporates ancient motifs and techniques such as shell necklaces and practical artifacts.

Photographer Ricky Maynard has had his work exhibited internationally and his documentary style &quot;brings to light the stories of Aboriginal people where they have previously been absent or distorted. His photographs mark historical sites, events and figures of great significance to Tasmanian and mainland Aboriginal people, and speak to their struggle in a subtle, poetic, and powerful way.&quot;

Modern painting in Tasmania is starting to use techniques shared by Aboriginal art in mainland Australia but incorporating traditional Tasmanian motifs, such as spirals and celestial representation.
This shows that, like mainland Australia, Aboriginal art is dynamic and evolving from established post-colonial preconceptions.

Tasmanian Aboriginal women have traditionally collected &quot;Maireener&quot; shells to fashion necklaces and bracelets.
This practice continues by Aboriginal women whose families survived on the Furneaux Islands, handed down by elder women to maintain an important link with traditional lifestyle.
Late in the nineteenth century a number of women aimed to keep this part of their traditional culture alive in order to allow their daughters and granddaughters to participate in their cultural heritage. Today, there are only a few Tasmanian Aboriginal women who maintain this art, but they continue to hand down their knowledge and skills to younger women in their community. Shell necklace manufacture continues to maintain links with the past but is expressed as a modern art form.

==== Writing ====
The earliest publication attributed to Tasmanian authors, predating the journalism of David Unaipon by a century, was &quot;The Aboriginal/Flinders Island Chronicle&quot;, written between September 1836 and December 1837, though it is unclear to what degree its composition was influenced by &quot;The Commandant&quot;, George Robinson.

Tasmanian Aboriginal authors in the past century have written history, poetry, essays and fiction. Authors such as Ida West have written autobiographies recounting their experiences growing up within white society; Phyllis Pitchford, Errol West and Jim Everett have written poetry, while Everett and Greg Lehman have explored their tradition as essayists.

==Genocide==

While no consensus exists as to the cause of the decimation of the Aboriginal Tasmanian population, many scholars consider the decimation to constitute a genocide. The debate about the cause generated a major controversy. The traditional view held that this dramatic demographic collapse was the result of the impact of introduced diseases, rather than the consequence of policy. Geoffrey Blainey, for example, wrote that by 1830 in Tasmania: &quot;Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating.&quot; Keith Windschuttle claimed that in addition to disease, the prostitution of women in a society already in decline, explained the extinction. Henry Reynolds attributed the depletion to losses in the Black War.

Many historians of colonialism and genocide, such as Ben Kiernan, Colin Tatz, and Benjamin Madley, consider that the Tasmanian decimation qualifies as genocide by the definition of Raphael Lemkin adopted in the UN Genocide Convention. Lemkin himself considered Tasmania to be the site of one of the world&#x27;s clear cases of genocide and Robert Hughes has described the loss of Aboriginal Tasmanians as &quot;the only true genocide in English colonial history&quot;. Other scholars who have supported the assessment of the near-destruction of the Aboriginal Tasmanians as genocide including: James Boyce, Lyndall Ryan, Tom Lawson, Mohamed Adhikari, Ashley Riley Sousa, Rebe Taylor, and Tony Barta.

==Legislated definition==
In June 2005, the Tasmanian Legislative Council introduced a reformed definition of Aboriginality into the Aboriginal Lands Act.
The bill was passed to allow Aboriginal Lands Council elections to commence, resolving the uncertainty over who was &quot;Aboriginal&quot;, and thus eligible to vote.

Under the bill, a person can claim &quot;Tasmanian Aboriginality&quot; if they meet all of the following criteria:
* Ancestry
* Self-identification
* Community recognition

==Government compensation for &quot;Stolen Generations&quot;==
On 13 August 1997 a Statement of Apology (specific to removal of children) was unanimously supported by the Tasmanian Parliament:

There are many people currently working in the community, academia, various levels of government and NGOs to strengthen Tasmanian Aboriginal culture and improve the conditions of the descendant community.

In November 2006, Tasmania became the first Australian state or territory to offer financial compensation for the Stolen Generations, Aboriginal people forcibly removed from their families by Australian government agencies and church missions between about 1900 and 1972. The Stolen Generations of Aboriginal Children Act 2006 was passed unanimously by all members of the Tasmanian Parliament. Up to 40 Aboriginal Tasmanians&#x27; descendants are expected to be eligible for compensation from the $5 million package.

<doc id="240308" wikidata="Q3496446" url="?curid=240308" title="Baltimore Stallions">
<text>The Baltimore Stallions (known officially as the &quot;Baltimore Football Club&quot; and previously as the &quot;Baltimore CFL Colts&quot; in its inaugural season) were a Canadian Football League team based in Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States, which played the 1994 and 1995 seasons. They were the most successful American team in the CFL&#x27;s southern expansion into the United States, and by at least one account, the most successful expansion team in North American professional sports history at the time. They had winning records in each season, and in both years advanced to the Grey Cup Final. In 1995, they became the only American franchise to win the Grey Cup.

In the final weeks of the Stallions&#x27; second season, it became public knowledge that the Maryland Stadium Authority and City of Baltimore were in serious negotiations with Art Modell, the long-time owner of the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL), to move his franchise to Baltimore for the 1996 season. Stallions owner Jim Speros knew his team could not begin to directly compete with the overwhelmingly more popular NFL brand. Even before the agreement with Modell became official within a month of the Stallions&#x27; Grey Cup triumph, he was actively seeking to re-locate his team elsewhere. Speros ultimately chose to move his football organization to Montreal and reconstitute it as the third and current iteration of the Montreal Alouettes. The Stallions franchise was dissolved, thus becoming one of three Grey Cup champions in the modern era to subsequently fold (the others being the Ottawa Rough Riders and the original Alouettes). The CFL considers the Stallions to be a separate franchise from the Alouettes.

==History==
For some 30 years, Baltimore had been home to the Baltimore Colts, a popular NFL team that suddenly moved literally overnight to Indianapolis in 1984. The former Philadelphia Stars of the United States Football League (USFL) nominally represented Baltimore in spring 1985. However, after being blocked from Memorial Stadium, the Colts&#x27; old home, due to objections from the Major League Baseball Baltimore Orioles, they were forced to play well outside the city bounds in College Park. The Stars had planned to move to Memorial Stadium in fall 1986, but the league failed before this could happen.

In the years after the Colts left, Baltimore made two serious bids to get another NFL team. It heavily wooed the St. Louis Cardinals football team owned by the Bidwill family, but they ultimately moved to Phoenix, Arizona as the Phoenix (later Arizona) Cardinals. In 1993, an ownership group failed to win an NFL expansion franchise, the Baltimore Bombers.

Soon after the expansion effort failed, entrepreneur and former Washington Redskins assistant Jim Speros was granted a CFL expansion franchise for Baltimore that would play in Memorial Stadium. Attempting to trade on the city&#x27;s love for the Colts, he invited the old Baltimore Colts Marching Band, which had stayed together along with the old team&#x27;s uniformed cheerleaders for over a decade, to play at his games. He recruited the remaining Baltimore Colts football fan clubs (&quot;Colt Corrals&quot;) to follow and support the new CFL franchise.

Speros initially called the team the &quot;Baltimore CFL Colts&quot;. Although the CFL club had adopted a color scheme that added silver to the Baltimore Colts&#x27; traditional colors of blue and white, as well as a stylized horse&#x27;s head logo that bore no resemblance to the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts&#x27; established horseshoe logo, the NFL nevertheless went to court and successfully obtained a legal injunction against the franchise&#x27;s use of any iteration of &quot;Colts&quot; in their name just hours before the team was to play its first game. Speros not only had to discard tons of purchased merchandise and souvenirs along with an advertising campaign, but also had to quickly change the franchise&#x27;s official name to the &quot;Baltimore Football Club,&quot; which some just called the &quot;Baltimore CFL&#x27;s.&quot;

Speros kept the team&#x27;s distinctive horse&#x27;s head logo with the expectation that local fans, long disillusioned with the NFL, would be disinclined to stop referring to the team as the &quot;Baltimore Colts.&quot; The team tacitly encouraged this sentiment to the extent they were legally permitted to do so. For example, for most of the 1994 season, Memorial Stadium&#x27;s public address announcer, Jack Taylor, would announce the team as &quot;your Baltimore CFL...&quot; – followed by a pause, during which time the crowd shouted &quot;COLTS!&quot; – after which he would conclude, &quot;...football team.&quot;

Number 19 was never issued out of respect to the Baltimore Colts&#x27; great Johnny Unitas.

===1994 season===
Speros&#x27;s approach to building the team was simple. He knew Canadian football was very different from the American game, so he made a point of hiring personnel and players with CFL experience. In contrast, the other American CFL teams stocked their rosters with former NFL players, former college football players, and locally-known players. Speros hired career CFL assistant Jim Popp as general manager, and named longtime CFL coach Don Matthews as head coach. Popp and Matthews, in turn, brought in experienced CFL players like QB Tracy Ham, RB Mike Pringle, LB O. J. Brigance, DT Jearld Baylis, DE Elfrid Payton. One of the more prominent NFL castoffs was K Donald Igwebuike; the team also offered a tryout to former Super Bowl XXII champion, Timmy Smith, who had been out of football several years by that point, but Smith failed to make the regular season roster. It also helped that Memorial Stadium had been originally built to accommodate baseball as well as football (moreover, by then the Orioles had vacated the venue for Camden Yards, thus making Memorial Stadium fully available for the CFL&#x27;s summer-to-fall schedule). Using Memorial Stadium&#x27;s baseball seating configuration gave it a field large enough to accommodate the full 150-yard length and 65-yard width of a regulation CFL field.

Even though they lacked an official name, the team finished second in the CFL East Division, with a 12–6 regular season record – more wins than any CFL expansion team before or since. In addition, the team was ranked third in the entire CFL in team scoring, and second in team defense.

Mike Pringle was the team&#x27;s offensive standout. Among other accomplishments, he earned the league&#x27;s leading rushing title with a record 1,972 yards and thirteen touchdowns. Pringle also returned 38 kicks for 814 yards, which made him a CFL All-Star, Eastern All-Star, and a Terry Evanshen Trophy winner.

In the playoffs, Baltimore hosted the Toronto Argonauts in the East semifinals at Memorial Stadium and won the game, 34–15. After the semifinal game, Baltimore ended up defeating the favored Winnipeg Blue Bombers at Winnipeg Stadium 14–12 to become the first (and only) American and expansion team to make it to the Grey Cup.

In the Grey Cup game, Baltimore was up against the B.C. Lions at BC Place Stadium in what amounted to a road game. Baltimore had the upper hand against the Lions, leading 17–10 at halftime and silencing the Lions&#x27; faithful; however, the Lions came back in the second half, winning by a score of 26–23 on a last-second Lui Passaglia field goal.

===1995 season===

After the 1994 season, the CFL announced that the League&#x27;s five U.S. teams—Baltimore, the San Antonio Texans (the former Sacramento Gold Miners), the Shreveport Pirates and the expansion Memphis Mad Dogs and Birmingham Barracudas—would be placed in a new South Division, while the Canadian teams would reside in the North Division. Just before the start of the 1995 season, a name-the-team fan poll was held to decide a new team name. After the team finished the first week of its second season still calling itself &quot;the Baltimore Football Club&quot;, the fan poll ended; Speros publicly announced that Baltimore&#x27;s team would be known as the &quot;Baltimore Stallions&quot;. The name change was a convenient one in that it allowed Baltimore&#x27;s logo and colors to remain unchanged from the 1994 season. Notably, the Stallions nickname had previously been used by a United States Football League team in Birmingham, nevertheless it was still available for Speros&#x27; team. Barracudas owner Art Williams had previously rejected reviving the moniker for his club, apparently because he considered it too timid (Birmingham would later reclaim the nickname for its reconstituted USFL/UFL franchise in the 2020&#x27;s).

Despite the changes to their name and team re-alignment, the Stallions returned with virtually the same roster for their next season. The exception was the signing of former Posse kicker Carlos Huerta to replace Igwebuike, who moved on to play with Memphis. With essentially the same team from the 1994 season, optimism and Grey Cup expectations were high for the Stallions. Optimism became reality as Baltimore continued their on-field dominance from the previous season. They started the season 2–3, but did not lose another game for the rest of the season. They ultimately finished with a 15–3 regular season record – first place in the South Division, and tying the Calgary Stampeders for the best record in the CFL.

Quarterback Tracy Ham with Mike Pringle and Robert Drummond were the most potent backfield in the CFL. Chris Armstrong became the team&#x27;s top receiver and the defense continued dominating opponents by allowing only 369 points-against, ranking the squad third in team defense. Mike Pringle had a slight drop-off from his 1994 numbers by rushing for 1,791 yards, being named the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player.

After defeating Winnipeg 36–21 in the divisional semifinals, the Stallions defeated the Texans 21–11 in the South final in what is (as of the 2024 season) the last meaningful CFL game played in the United States. This vaulted them to the Grey Cup final for the second straight season. They traveled to Regina&#x27;s Taylor Field to face the 15–3 North Division champion Stampeders, who were led by coach Wally Buono, QB Doug Flutie, and his two top receivers, Allen Pitts and Dave Sapunjis. During the game, the winds at Taylor Field were particularly strong and gusted up to 85 km/h (52.8 mph). That did not slow down the Stallions, as they defeated the Stampeders, 37–20 to become the first American team to win the Grey Cup, with Tracy Ham becoming the Grey Cup&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Counting the playoffs, the Stallions ended the season on a 16-game winning streak.

===Fan support===

In addition to being the most successful of the U.S. CFL teams on the field, Baltimore was far and away the most successful of the CFL&#x27;s American teams at the box office. It had significant fan support and strong attendance – averaging 37,347 in 1994 (best in the CFL), and 30,112 in 1995 (second best).

Fan support in Baltimore was driven by a number of factors not present in the CFL&#x27;s other U.S. markets. Their success on the field was one obvious factor. However many fans were motivated to support the CFL out of antipathy towards the NFL, which had not only backed the re-location of the NFL Colts to Indianapolis, but had subsequently spurned several attempts to return an NFL franchise to the city. Another major factor in Baltimore&#x27;s success at the gate was the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which wiped out the last two months of the Orioles&#x27; season. Baltimore was also a significantly more heavily populated market than the other CFL American markets and the only one to have previously hosted an NFL team, giving the Stallions a larger base from which to draw fans. Finally, the Stallions did not have to compete with college football for an audience to nearly the same extent as the other U.S. CFL franchises.

===In the end===

After the 1995 season, the CFL decided to disband three of its five American franchises and return to its traditional East–West divisional alignment for the 1996 season. The two remaining American teams, Baltimore and San Antonio, were to be placed in the CFL&#x27;s East Division.

However, this strategy collapsed on the week of the South Division final, when longtime Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell announced he would be moving his team to Baltimore. Speros had initially not believed the rumors of Modell courting Baltimore when they cropped up in September. However, when it emerged that Modell was in talks with state and local officials, Speros began scouting out cities for a possible move.

This proved prescient; as soon as the move was announced, local support for the Stallions dried up almost overnight, with fans switching virtually &quot;en masse&quot; to the NFL. It quickly became apparent that most Stallions fans had only supported the CFL out of resentment towards the NFL, or even just as a means of pressuring the NFL to return. Whatever the case, the loss of support was so dramatic that the Stallions were forced to basically give away tickets for the South Division final. Even the Grey Cup victory celebration at Inner Harbor went almost unnoticed in the local media and the press, despite a few local dignitaries such as Mayor Kurt Schmoke attending.

Even after the NFL&#x27;s return to Baltimore became certain, Schmoke and other city leaders claimed that the Stallions could coexist with Modell&#x27;s team, which was eventually reconstituted as the Baltimore Ravens. However, Speros and CFL officials soon realized that no matter how successful the Stallions had been, they had no realistic prospect of competing head-to-head with an NFL team. As the team&#x27;s successful Grey Cup run was still underway, it became apparent that there would not be enough advertising revenue or fan support to go around. Even without that to consider, the Stallions would have been left without a suitable place to play. The conditions set by the NFL to permit the Ravens to temporarily play at Memorial Stadium pending completion of a new stadium would have made it all but impossible for the venue to convert its grass field back and forth between the two leagues&#x27; configurations when their seasons overlapped. In any case, the Stallions would have likely been evicted from Memorial Stadium anyways to make way for the Ravens. No other stadium in the Baltimore area was large enough or suitable enough even for temporary CFL use.

Rather than risk being reduced to the secondary team in Baltimore, Speros ceded Baltimore to the Ravens and announced plans to move the franchise. He was actually very close to moving the franchise to Houston, Texas to take advantage of the pending departure of the NFL&#x27;s recently departed Houston Oilers from the Astrodome, with then-Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane as a minority partner. However, under prodding from CFL officials who believed the American experiment was a lost cause, Speros began talks with officials in Montreal. CFL commissioner Larry Smith believed the defending CFL champions would be a better vehicle for bringing the CFL back to Montreal rather than what would have essentially been an expansion team. At a league meeting on February 2, 1996; Speros was granted permission to move the Stallions to Montreal, effectively ending the American experiment. Although Speros seriously considered whether to keep the Stallions name, he ultimately decided to give up the Stallions franchise and reconstitute his organization as the third and current incarnation of the Montreal Alouettes. Speros kept the Alouettes for only one year before selling the franchise to Robert C. Wetenhall in 1997.

Sixteen former Baltimore Stallions players earned tryouts for NFL teams in 1996.

===Historical note===
The CFL does not officially consider the Stallions to be part of the Alouettes&#x27; history. According to official league records, Speros canceled the Stallions franchise after the 1995 season and reclaimed the dormant Alouettes franchise. Consequently, when Speros moved the team to Montreal, all of the Stallions players were released from their contracts, though Popp managed to re-sign many of them. The current Alouettes claim the history of the 1946–1986 Alouettes (including their stint as the Concordes from 1982 to 1985) as their own, and the CFL has retconned the Alouettes as having suspended operations from 1987 to 1995.

As of the end of the 2016 season, team president Mark Weightman is the only remaining link between the Stallions and Alouettes. General manager Jim Popp followed the team to Montreal as general manager and guided the franchise to 8 Grey Cup Finals, winning 3 of them – giving him a total of 10 Grey Cup Finals appearances and 4 Grey Cups with the Stallions/Alouettes organization. Popp resigned as general manager at the end of the team&#x27;s 2016 season. Weightman served as an operations intern for the Stallions in 1995 and then joined the Alouettes as an operations staffer in 1996.

<text>The subfamily Caprinae, also sometimes referred to as the tribe Caprini, is part of the ruminant family Bovidae, and consists of mostly medium-sized bovids. A member of this subfamily is called a caprine.

Prominent members include sheep and goats, with some other members referred to as goat antelopes. Some earlier taxonomies considered Caprinae a separate family called Capridae (with the members being caprids), but now it is usually considered either a subfamily within the Bovidae, or a tribe within the subfamily Antilopinae of the family Bovidae, with caprines being a type of bovid.

==Characteristics==
Although most goat-antelopes are gregarious and have fairly stocky builds, they diverge in many other ways – the muskox (&quot;Ovibos moschatus&quot;) is adapted to the extreme cold of the tundra; the mountain goat (&quot;Oreamnos americanus&quot;) of North America is specialised for very rugged terrain; the urial (&quot;Ovis orientalis&quot;) occupies a largely infertile area from Kashmir to Iran, including much desert country. The Armenian mouflon (&quot;Ovis gmelini gmelini&quot;) is thought to be the ancestor of the modern domestic sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;).

Many species have become extinct since the last ice age, probably largely because of human interaction. Of the survivors:
* Five are classified as endangered,
* Eight as vulnerable,
* Seven as of concern and needing conservation measures, but at lower risk, and
* Seven species are secure.

Members of the group vary considerably in size, from just over long for a full-grown grey goral (&quot;Nemorhaedus goral&quot;), to almost long for a musk ox, and from under to more than . Musk oxen in captivity have reached over .

The lifestyles of caprids fall into two broad classes: &#x27;resource-defenders&#x27;, which are territorial and defend a small, food-rich area against other members of the same species; and &#x27;grazers&#x27;, which gather together into herds and roam freely over a larger, usually relatively infertile area.

The resource-defenders are the more primitive group: they tend to be smaller, dark in colour, males and females fairly alike, have long, tessellated ears, long manes, and dagger-shaped horns. The grazers (sometimes collectively known as tsoan caprids, from the Hebrew &quot;&quot; meaning sheep and goats) evolved more recently. They tend to be larger, highly social, and rather than mark territory with scent glands, they have highly evolved dominance behaviours. No sharp line divides the groups, but a continuum varies from the serows at one end of the spectrum to sheep, true goats, and musk oxen at the other.

==Evolution==

The goat-antelope, or caprid, group is known from as early as the Miocene, when members of the group resembled the modern serow in their general body form. The group did not reach its greatest diversity until the recent ice ages, when many of its members became specialised for marginal, often extreme, environments: mountains, deserts, and the subarctic region.

The ancestors of the modern sheep and goats (both rather vague and ill-defined terms) are thought to have moved into mountainous regions – sheep becoming specialised occupants of the foothills and nearby plains, and relying on flight and flocking for defence against predators, and goats adapting to very steep terrain where predators are at a disadvantage.

<text>The Birmingham Barracudas were a Canadian football team that played the 1995 season in the Canadian Football League. The Barracudas were part of a failed attempt to expand the CFL into the United States.

==History==

===In the beginning===
Insurance tycoon, former high school football coach and motivational speaker Art Williams was awarded a CFL expansion franchise in Birmingham. He wanted a nickname for the team that would &quot;scare the spit out of people,&quot; and chose Barracudas.

The Barracudas hired an experienced head coach in Jack Pardee, who had coached at the college level with the University of Houston and at the professional level with the WFL, USFL, and NFL. (Pardee is perhaps better known as one of the few six-man football players to have ever made it to the professional leagues; his knowledge of that wide-open game proved to serve him well in the similarly wide-open CFL.) The Barracudas were also led by veteran CFL quarterback Matt Dunigan, who had his greatest season while in Birmingham.

===During the season===
Birmingham competed in the Southern Division along with the San Antonio Texans, Baltimore Stallions, Memphis Mad Dogs, and Shreveport Pirates. After losing their two pre-season games, they played their first game July 4, 1995, versus the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in Winnipeg. They won 38–10, and would lose to the Tiger-Cats in Hamilton 31–13. They would get their revenge a week later at home by beating the Cats 51–28 in front of 31,000 fans.

The biggest home game of the season came against the Baltimore Stallions. It also proved to be the biggest disappointment, as the Barracudas lost 36–8.

Attendance at Legion Field was very good at first. The Birmingham crowds were some of the largest in the league. However, the CFL traditionally plays on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, largely to avoid competing on television (both in its native country and the U.S.) with the National Football League. Williams knew that Birmingham was a high school and college football hotbed. Well aware the CFL&#x27;s scheduling model would cause serious attendance problems in the fall, Williams persuaded the league to let the &#x27;Cudas play their September and October home games on Sundays so as not to compete directly against high school teams on Fridays and Alabama or Auburn on Saturdays. Because Alabamians in general are not loyal to any one NFL team, Williams reckoned that competing with that league on television was the more sensible risk to take. Despite this, attendance still fell through the floor as most Birmingham-area fans stayed home to watch the NFL on TV. Their last four home games did not attract more than 9,000 people, and looked even smaller than that since Legion Field seated over 83,000 people at the time. The Memphis Mad Dogs were plagued by similar attendance problems.

In the team&#x27;s final home game, against the Edmonton Eskimos, Matt Dunigan left the game due to a shoulder injury, and Birmingham was forced to turn to back-up quarterback Jimmy Klingler. Despite the loss, the Barracudas still had a chance to claim home-field advantage in the playoffs. However, they lost a shootout of a season finale in San Antonio, finishing third in the Southern Division. They returned to San Antonio the following week for the Southern Division Semi-Final, but were whipped by the Texans 52–9, ending their first and only playoff run.

===After the season===
Owner Art Williams estimated that he had spent $10 million to launch the Barracudas, and had probably lost at least that, if not more, during the season. He also began criticizing the Canadian Football League, and its unique concept. Along with other U.S. owners, Williams wanted several changes made:

*Reducing the size of a CFL field to American football standards.
*Allowing only 11 players on each side of the ball, rather than 12.
*Changing the name of the league to show more of a U.S. presence.

The biggest change Williams wanted, however, was to move the season to the spring; he was not willing to risk another season of going head-to-head with college football. When the league refused to go along, Williams decided to get out. A day after losing in the South semifinals, he announced that the &#x27;Cudas would not return to Birmingham in 1996, if they returned at all. In January 1996, he sold the team for $750,000—a significant loss, based on his own estimates—to a group of investors called Ark-La-Tex Football Association, who intended to move the team to Shreveport as a replacement for the Shreveport Pirates, who had collapsed under the mismanagement of infamous CFL owner Bernard Glieberman. The Pirates had been barely competitive on the field (winning only eight games in two years) and hamstrung by Glieberman off it, but nevertheless had managed to attract a fairly consistent and numerous fan base comparable with the established CFL teams that didn&#x27;t disappear when college football season started. Although Shreveport was far smaller than Birmingham, it was thought that moving the &#x27;Cudas there would match a team that had made a good showing in its first season with a market that was at least potentially capable of supporting it. The relocation, which hinged upon league approval, would have been part of a plan to keep at least three American teams in the CFL by concentrating the American teams in the Southwest: the Baltimore Stallions would have moved to Houston, while the San Antonio Texans would stay where they were.

By the end of January, it became clear that the league was no longer interested in playing in the United States. The league rejected the sale of the Barracudas and ordered them shut down. The Stallions ownership group was concurrently awarded the remains of the inactive Montreal Alouettes franchise, which started play in 1996. Without a second American team, Anderson was unwilling to go it alone and folded the Texans, ending the CFL&#x27;s American experiment. Williams would go on to purchase the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League in 1998, and sell the club a year later.

<doc id="240312" wikidata="Q6492616" url="?curid=240312" title="Las Vegas Posse">
<text>The Las Vegas Posse were a Canadian Football League (CFL) team, that played at the Sam Boyd Silver Bowl in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, in the league&#x27;s 1994 season as part of the CFL&#x27;s failed American expansion. Lasting only one season, the Posse were one of the least successful teams in CFL history, both on the field and off.

==History==
===On the field===
The Posse had notable football talent such as KR Tamarick Vanover, RB Jon Volpe, LB Greg Battle, LB Shonte Peoples, DB/QB Darian Hagan and K Carlos Huerta, and also had rookie quarterback Anthony Calvillo, who would later go on to become the all-time leader in passing yards in all of professional football. 

The franchise also had an experienced coaching staff with Head Coach Ron Meyer, who had previous coaching experiences with UNLV and in the NFL, and also had future Winnipeg Blue Bombers coach Jeff Reinebold as one of their Assistant Coaches. Carlos Huerta won the Jackie Parker Trophy as the Most Outstanding Rookie of the West Division that year.

The Posse started with wins over the Sacramento Gold Miners and Saskatchewan Roughriders, but things quickly went downhill, in part due to a lack of familiarity with the Canadian game.

For instance, during a game against the BC Lions, Vanover signaled for a fair catch, not knowing that there is no fair catch in Canadian football, with the ball rolling into the Posse end zone, which the Lions promptly recovered it for a touchdown. Players also openly complained about the apathy of their coaches and teammates.

The Posse finished the season 5–13, finishing last in the West Division and next-to-last in the CFL.

===Off the field===
When the Posse started the 1994 season, it was clear that CFL football would not last in Las Vegas. They were owned by a publicly held corporation whose largest shareholder was Cleveland, Ohio-based Nick Mileti, former owner of MLB&#x27;s Cleveland Indians, the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers and the AHL&#x27;s Cleveland Barons. Although Mileti was the public face of the ownership group, he had little direct involvement in team operations, with chairman Glenn Golenberg having more active involvement in team affairs.

The team played at Sam Boyd Stadium in suburban Whitney. As was the case with many of the other playing fields of the American CFL teams, the end zones at the stadium were only 15 yards long, instead of the usual 20 yards needed for the Canadian game. In addition, the stadium was uncovered and offered no protection from the infamous Las Vegas summer heat. Head coach Ron Meyer was seen at many practices running drills with no shirt on in the sweltering heat. 

The Posse practiced on a smaller-than-regulation field (only 70 yards long) at the Riviera Casino and Resort, where a sign read &quot;Field of ImPOSSEable Dreams.&quot; With no marketing assistance from the league and a myriad of other entertainment options, local interest was virtually nonexistent.

The most memorable moment for the franchise occurred on July 8, 1994, when the team played the Sacramento Gold Miners in the first ever CFL match involving two American-based teams. The Posse defeated the Gold Miners 32–26 at Sacramento&#x27;s Hornet Stadium.

There were also several infamous moments. At the team&#x27;s first home game against Saskatchewan, the singer of the national anthems, Dennis Casey Parks (singing under the pseudonym &quot;Greg Bartholomew&quot;), sang &quot;O Canada&quot;, which he had only begun practicing the day before after returning from performing in Japan, to the tune of &quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; after the music system failed. The incident prompted complaints by Canadians to the CFL, negative press for the new team, as well as a letter from Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to Posse ownership. Two weeks later, Parks was brought to a game in Hamilton where he sang it properly. On another occasion, Posse head coach Ron Meyer asked the &quot;Showgirls&quot; to loiter behind the bench of the BC Lions in an attempt to distract the opposition. The scheme did not work and Las Vegas lost the game 39–16.

The Posse&#x27;s attendance figures were never good to begin with, but significantly tailed off as the summer wore on. Management unsuccessfully tried to sell tickets by employing tactics such as:
* Reducing ticket prices to US$9 for each seat. The few who bought season tickets for about US$750 (in more expensive categories) were given extra tickets to make up for the price difference.
* Advertising their scantily-clad cheerleaders, the &quot;Showgirls&quot;, and by staging halftime bikini contests.

The Posse&#x27;s penultimate home game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers had an announced attendance of only 2,350 people, the lowest recorded attendance in CFL history. Several hundred of those in attendance were fans who made the trip from Winnipeg. Just before the team&#x27;s last scheduled home game, against the Edmonton Eskimos, Mileti announced the team would disband due to massive losses.

The CFL, however, does not allow teams to fold in midseason. Instead, it moved the game to Edmonton&#x27;s Commonwealth Stadium, citing the Posse&#x27;s meager gate. Several Eskimo season ticket holders had already arrived in Las Vegas when the game was moved, and were forced to watch the game in a ballroom at the Imperial Palace when Air Canada was unable to fly them back to Edmonton on such short notice. The Posse&#x27;s average attendance was a dismal 8,953.

==== Seasons ====
===In the end===
After the season, Mileti entered talks with a group from Milwaukee led by Marvin Fishman. Fishman was looking for a way to keep professional football in Milwaukee after the Green Bay Packers, who had made been playing part of their schedule in Milwaukee for sixty seasons, announced they would play in Green Bay full time from the 1995 NFL season onward. These talks very nearly came to fruition before the Milwaukee Brewers, who objected to sharing Milwaukee County Stadium with a team that played nine home games with many of them in the summer, blocked the lease. The Brewers had tolerated late-season Packers home games as that team played mostly outside baseball season, but with the Packers&#x27; pending departure they wanted as few obstacles as possible to that stadium&#x27;s eventual replacement with a baseball-only facility at a time when such venues were still considered an expensive novelty by many local governments and much of the public. Even after the failure of the proposed Posse move, the CFL still wanted to bring a team to Milwaukee, as it was far more ideal in terms of proximity to Canada than its other teams. 

After the failure of the Milwaukee plans, a group led by singer and business mogul Jimmy Buffett attempted to buy and relocate the franchise to Jackson, Mississippi. Buffett had gone so far as to begin assembling a front office (led by general manager Eric Tillman) and coaching staff (led by John Payne), and the CFL included the Jackson team in its 1995 draft schedule. Buffett&#x27;s first managing partner, William L. Collins, had a sale contract written up before the Posse&#x27;s board of directors unexpectedly raised the price of the team, prompting Collins to drop his bid. The CFL considered revoking the franchise and awarding a new expansion team to Collins, only to be threatened with a lawsuit from the Posse board of directors. Another investor for Jackson, Norton Herrick, offered an even higher price than Collins but backed out when he could not secure the money to fund the team through its expected losses. By this time, league officials had become increasingly cool toward moving to Jackson. The CFL was pressing for a U. S. television contract, and league officials did not feel that placing a team in such a small market would aid that cause.

The league then voted to suspend the Posse franchise and gave the Mileti group until December 1995 to sell the team. A dispersal draft was held for its players in 1995. Defensive end Derrell Robertson, who had been killed in a December 1994 car accident, was included; the league was unaware of Robertson&#x27;s death and included him in the pool of potential draftees, and the Ottawa Rough Riders selected him. It was only after making inquiries about Robertson that the Rough Riders and the CFL discovered that Robertson had died. According to Riders coach Jim Gilstrap in a June 1995 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article, &quot;the league didn&#x27;t know he was dead until we told them, and we didn&#x27;t know until we couldn&#x27;t find him.&quot;

The failure of the Posse also affected the team&#x27;s geographically closest rival, the Sacramento Gold Miners. Before the Posse&#x27;s arrival, the Miners had been nearly away from their nearest opponent, the BC Lions. The Posse&#x27;s failure meant that the Gold Miners again faced the prospect of traveling extremely long distances for away games. This, along with dissatisfaction with Hornet Stadium, prompted the Miners to become the San Antonio Texans for 1995.

After the dispersal draft another group from Miami tried to purchase the remains of the Posse and move the team to Miami. The deal called for the franchise would return for the 1996 season as the Miami Manatees. In order to introduce the Miami fans to the CFL game, a pre-season game was played at the Orange Bowl between the Baltimore Stallions and the Birmingham Barracudas in 1995 (Baltimore won the game by a score of 37–0 in front of 20,216 fans). Unlike the Mississippi proposals, the Manatees would have retained the services of Meyer as head coach. However, the deal fell apart when the CFL ended its American experiment after the 1995 season. The last active player from the Las Vegas Posse (or any American CFL franchise) was quarterback Anthony Calvillo, who last played for the Montreal Alouettes in 2013.

===After the Posse===
The Posse was the first attempt by one of the major professional sports leagues in North America to place a team in Las Vegas proper. Las Vegas had only ascended to major-city status in the 1980s, and even after that most major leagues traditionally avoided it due in part to its gambling reputation. Future professional football leagues would place teams in Las Vegas, with the XFL&#x27;s Las Vegas Outlaws, the Arena League&#x27;s Las Vegas Sting, Las Vegas Gladiators and Las Vegas Outlaws, and the UFL&#x27;s Las Vegas Locomotives all residing in the city. The XFL Outlaws and Locomotives did somewhat better drawing fans to Sam Boyd Stadium than the Posse did, although both experienced steep declines as the years went on (to the point where the Locomotives were drawing fewer than the Posse by the end of their run). They also had better on-field performance, particularly the Locomotives, who played in all three championship games the UFL had and won two of them. In the early 2000&#x27;s, Las Vegas, which has been home to a Triple-A Pacific Coast League team since 1983 was briefly considered by Major League Baseball as a potential new home for the Montreal Expos (who were soon to relocate) but in the end they would move to Washington, D.C. to become the Washington Nationals, in 2016 however Rob Manfred (current Commissioner of the MLB) said the city was a &quot;viable alternative&quot; for a potential expansion team. 

Major league sports interest in Las Vegas would ultimately culminate when the National Hockey League 21 years later awarded the city an expansion team known as the Vegas Golden Knights which began play for the 2017-18 NHL season. The Golden Knights would go on to become the most successful expansion team in North American sports history and make it to the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals in their very first season only to lose (in five games) to the Washington Capitals. Major league professional football finally settled in the area for good when the NFL&#x27;s Oakland Raiders relocated to Las Vegas and began play in the city in 2020 playing in Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, which replaced Sam Boyd, making Las Vegas the second former CFL city (after Baltimore) to become home to an NFL franchise.

<text>The Ottawa Renegades were a Canadian Football League franchise based in Ottawa, Ontario founded in 2002, six years after the storied Ottawa Rough Riders folded. After four seasons, the Renegades franchise was suspended indefinitely by the league due to financial instability, and its players were absorbed by the other teams in a dispersal draft.

After two years in limbo, the Renegades franchise was awarded to Jeff Hunt, best known as the owner of the Ottawa 67&#x27;s, in March 2008. The new franchise was revived in 2014 and rebranded as the Ottawa Redblacks. For historical purposes, the CFL classifies the Redblacks, Renegades and Rough Riders as one discontinuous franchise.

== History ==

The Ottawa Renegades returned Canadian Football League action to Canada&#x27;s capital in 2002. Ottawa had been without a team since 1996, when the Ottawa Rough Riders folded. The logo chosen draws similarities to the logo used by the Rough Riders for much of their existence up until 1992. The Renegades played four seasons and never qualified for the playoffs. In May 2005, Bernard Glieberman (former owner of the Rough Riders and the CFL USA&#x27;s Shreveport Pirates) took ownership of the team, and made his son Lonie Glieberman team president, and many of the same names they had employed during the unsuccessful years of Glieberman&#x27;s ownership of their previous teams started reappearing (for example, Björn Nittmo, by this point severely brain-damaged, almost 39 years old and out of football since 2001, was brought in as a potential kicker in the 2005 season). The team&#x27;s only head coach was Joe Paopao. On November 7, 2005, the Ottawa Renegades announced John Jenkins as head coach and General Manager for 2006, with Forrest Gregg serving as the team&#x27;s Executive VP for football. However, this did not occur because of the suspension of the team&#x27;s operations.

On March 3, 2006, Lonie Glieberman resigned from day-to-day operations of the team, acknowledging that he made mistakes during his tenure.

With the team losing $3.8 million in 2005, and the possibility of losing an additional $2.3 million to $5.8 million in 2006, the organization requested financial assistance from the CFL, which the league was not willing to provide. On March 22, 2006, Bernie Glieberman decided to stop funding the Renegades. While the CFL previously took over operations of the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 2003, on April 9, 2006, the CFL&#x27;s board of governors decided against doing the same for the Renegades, instead choosing to look for a new owner. The CFL moved its easternmost-West Division team, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, back to the East Division for the third time in its history to take Ottawa&#x27;s place and to balance out the divisions (the Bombers played in the East from 1987–94, 1997–2001 and this time from 2006–13).

The players of the Ottawa Renegades were dispersed to the remaining eight CFL teams in a dispersal draft, with QB Kerry Joseph going #1 to the Saskatchewan Roughriders.

Steelback Brewery president Frank D&#x27;Angelo announced in April 2006 that he was exploring opportunities to revive the team. The announcement was not cleared with the Canadian Football League, who indicated that they had had only one informal conversation with D&#x27;Angelo, in which no decision was made.

On May 15, 2007, the CFL announced that it had ended discussions with a group led by William Palmer regarding the return of a CFL team to Ottawa for the 2008 season.

CFL Commissioner Mark Cohon stated &quot;[s]everal parties have expressed interest regarding a franchise for Ottawa, and we have decided to concentrate efforts on these new opportunities. The CFL remains committed to the City of Ottawa, and we remain determined to return a franchise to the nation’s capital only at a time and under circumstances that will ensure strength and stability in the long run&quot;.

However, in September 2007, the lower south side of Frank Clair Stadium was closed, due to cracks in the concrete structure. Ottawa mayor Larry O&#x27;Brien was quoted at the time that this was an opportunity to do a review of the usage and the facilities of Lansdowne Park.

On March 25, 2008, the league ended the team&#x27;s indefinite limbo by awarding the franchise to Jeff Hunt, owner of the Ottawa 67&#x27;s. The team began play in 2014, and did not retain the name &quot;Renegades&quot; because of its troubled history (and could not use the &quot;Rough Riders&quot; name due to objections from the Saskatchewan Roughriders), instead being called the Ottawa Redblacks.

== Seasons ==
== Players ==

As of the start of the 2018 CFL season, Kyries Hebert was the last active former Renegade player still on a CFL team roster. He is also the only former Renegade to have played for the Ottawa Redblacks. Former Renegades Korey Banks, Kerry Joseph, Yo Murphy, Marc Parenteau, and Markus Howell have also gone on to be Grey Cup champions.

Dan Crowley was the team&#x27;s first starting quarterback. Throughout 2002, backup quarterbacks Chuck Clements and Oteman Sampson, also saw some starting time. However, in 2003, Kerry Joseph, was the quarterback to ultimately succeed Crowley. During 2003, Romaro Miller also started at quarterback. During 2004 and 2005, Joseph functioned as the primary starting quarterback. However, backups Darnell Kennedy and Brad Banks also saw time as the starter, in relief of Joseph.

<doc id="240317" wikidata="Q6815845" url="?curid=240317" title="Memphis Mad Dogs">
<text>The Memphis Mad Dogs were a Canadian football team that played the 1995 season in the Canadian Football League. The Mad Dogs were part of a failed attempt to expand the CFL into the United States. They played at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium.

The team&#x27;s principal owner was Fred Smith, founder of FedEx.

==History==

Prior to the Mad Dogs, Smith fronted an ownership group (along with such entities as former Memphis Showboats owner William Dunavant and the estate of Elvis Presley) that tried to get a National Football League team into Memphis in 1993. The Memphis Hound Dogs, as the proposed team was to be called, was one of five teams to be considered, but was passed over in favor of the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars. Smith, after briefly considering a proposed &quot;new league&quot; backed by CBS, then turned to the CFL. The league was very impressed with Smith; his group was the richest in CFL history at the time. It seriously considered selling either the Hamilton Tiger-Cats or Calgary Stampeders to Smith. After those teams resolved their ownership situations, Smith&#x27;s group was granted an expansion franchise for 1995. With Presley&#x27;s estate no longer involved, the team eschewed &quot;Hound Dogs&quot; in favor of &quot;Mad Dogs,&quot; ostensibly through a name-the-team contest.

===On the field===
The Mad Dogs hired Pepper Rodgers as their first head coach. Rodgers was familiar to Memphis pro football fans as he was the head coach of one of the city&#x27;s previous pro football team, the Memphis Showboats of the USFL; the Mad Dogs had also hired Steve Ehrhart, the Showboats&#x27; general manager, in the same capacity. Ehrhart had been trying since 1987 to get the CFL to expand into the United States. The team&#x27;s mascot was a black Labrador retriever named Alien, who was known for charging the field and retrieving the kicking tee following each kickoff.

The Mad Dogs tried to copy the Baltimore Stallions&#x27; blueprint by getting staff and players who had previous CFL experience. As part of that blueprint, the Mad Dogs hired former CFL coach Adam Rita to become their new offensive coordinator. Rita had coached the Toronto Argonauts and the Edmonton Eskimos to Grey Cup championships in 1991 and 1993. The Mad Dogs then signed veteran QB Damon Allen, who won the Grey Cup with the Eskimos in 1987 and 1993 (the latter with Rita), earning Grey Cup MVP honors in both years. Other notable players on offense included Eddie Brown (SB), Joe Horn (WR) and former NFL kicker Donald Igwebuike.

However, the offense was only able to score a total of 346 points, last in the CFL behind the Ottawa Rough Riders. On a positive note, the Mad Dogs were known for their strong defense that was rated second, behind Edmonton, in the CFL for giving up the fewest points with 364, due in large part to the strong defensive play of Tim Cofield and Rodney Harding.

One of the reasons for poor offense and great defense was the size of the field. The Liberty Bowl was not as well suited to the Canadian game, as the stands were very close to the field of play, making it difficult to reconfigure the field to CFL standards. As a result, even with the addition of AstroTurf cutouts to widen and lengthen the field, it was still narrower and shorter than all other CFL fields, including other US fields which were not regulation. In order to shoehorn even an approximation of a Canadian field onto the playing surface, the end zones became half-grass/half-Astroturf pentagons that were only nine yards long in the middle and seven yards long at the sidelines. CFL rules call for a 20-yard end zone, and no other stadium had end zones shorter than 15 yards. The stands jutted into the corners of the end zones, creating a clear safety hazard.

Memphis ended the 1995 CFL season with a 9–9–0 regular season record, which placed them fourth in the South Division and one game out of the playoffs.

===Off the field===
Pepper Rodgers was known around the football world as a likable man. However, he often made uncomplimentary remarks about the Canadian Football League, which also showed signs that the CFL&#x27;s foray into the United States was doomed to failure from the start.

The team drew relatively well during the first two months of the season. While the crowds were not nearly as large as those the Showboats or Southmen had drawn, they were still comparable to those for the established CFL franchises. However, the Mad Dogs had their legs cut out from under them by quirks in the CFL schedule. The CFL traditionally plays on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays — the same days as high school and college football games in the United States - largely to avoid competing on television (both in its native country and the U.S.) with the National Football League. Smith realized that the Mad Dogs could not hope to draw respectable crowds if they had to go head-to-head with high school games on Fridays and Tennessee Volunteers and Ole Miss Rebels football on Saturdays. The Birmingham Barracudas, also based in a high school and college football hotbed, faced the same problem. With this in mind, Smith and Barracudas owner Art Williams persuaded the CFL to let their teams play late-season home games on Sundays. They apparently believed that attempting to compete with NFL broadcasts in markets that did not support any one NFL team in particular was the more sensible risk to take. It did not work; several late season games in Memphis drew crowds of fewer than 10,000, dropping the team&#x27;s average attendance to around 14,550 by the end of the season. As early as September, Smith was blaming community indifference and outright hostility from the media for the team&#x27;s steep decline at the gate.

Tim Cofield became the only Mad Dogs player to win the James P. McCaffrey Trophy as the Most Outstanding Defensive Player of the South Division.

===In the end===
Due to massive losses and the late-season attendance collapse, the Mad Dogs folded at the December 1995 CFL meetings. 

By February 1996, the Barracudas, Texans and Shreveport Pirates had also folded while the Stallions had reconstituted themselves as the third incarnation of the Montreal Alouettes, ending the CFL&#x27;s three-year experiment south of the border.

Besides financial and attendance problems, the Mad Dogs were hobbled by the promotional efforts of the CFL itself. The league positioned itself directly against the NFL when it attempted to move south of the border. The CFL adopted the marketing slogan, &quot;Longer, Wider, Faster&quot; to appeal to the American football market. Rodgers had expressed frustration in the efforts to market the Mad Dogs and Canadian football to the Mid-South.

===After the Mad Dogs===

The city of Memphis would go on to host several more professional football franchises. The most notable was the Liberty Bowl&#x27;s hosting of the NFL&#x27;s Tennessee Oilers for the 1997 season. The plan was for the Oilers, who were to be based in Nashville once a new stadium was ready, to play two full seasons in Memphis because the city had the state&#x27;s only stadium that was ideally sized for the NFL at the time. The largest stadium in Nashville at the time, Vanderbilt Stadium, seated only 41,000 people and was deemed too small even for temporary use. The state&#x27;s largest stadium, Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, seated over 102,000 people, far too large to sell out in time to avoid local blackouts. If successful, it could have set Memphis up to make another bid on the expansion franchise that was to be awarded in the wake of the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy (what eventually became the Houston Texans).

However, like the Mad Dogs, the Oilers proved to be an attendance disaster in Memphis. Due to Memphians&#x27; unwillingness to support a lame-duck team and Nashvillians&#x27; reluctance to travel on Interstate 40 to see &quot;their&quot; team play, Oilers games didn&#x27;t draw much more than the Mad Dogs had drawn even on a good day and often drew more opponents&#x27; fans than Oilers fans. The Oilers backed out of the Memphis arrangement after only one season and played the 1998 season at Vanderbilt.

The Memphis Pharaohs played two seasons in the Arena Football League, their first concurrent with the Mad Dogs, in 1995 and 1996. In 2001, Memphis would host the XFL&#x27;s Memphis Maniax. in 2019, the AAF&#x27;s Memphis Express and the 2000s AF2&#x27;s Memphis Xplorers. The Xplorers would last for six seasons. Currently Memphis is home to a second incarnation of the Memphis Showboats in the United Football League. Memphis would also have success in other professional sports, landing another Canadian export with the relocation of the Vancouver Grizzlies in 2001, which became the Memphis Grizzlies that have been playing there ever since.

<doc id="240318" wikidata="Q702643" url="?curid=240318" title="Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ">
<text>is the third installment in Sunrise&#x27;s long running &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise and the last TV series in the franchise released in Japan&#x27;s Shōwa period. A direct follow up to &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, it is directed and written by Yoshiyuki Tomino, and he assembled a new team consisting of character designer Hiroyuki Kitazume, who had been one of &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;″s animation directors, and mechanical designers Makoto Kobayashi, Yutaka Izubuchi and Mika Akitaka. Initially airing on Nagoya Broadcasting Network and affiliated ANN stations in Japan, the series was later aired by the anime satellite television network Animax across Japan and its respective networks worldwide, including Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, South Asia, and other regions. The now-defunct video streaming website Daisuki had the rights to stream the series worldwide. Sunrise themselves released the series on home video via Right Stuf Inc. to North America in 2015. On June 24, 2022, the series was made available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

==Overview==

&quot;Gundam ZZ&quot; was conceived as a sequel to &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;, featuring a mostly all-new cast. Its broadcast immediately followed that of Zeta Gundam and continues to follow a major plotline from &quot;Zeta&quot; involving Haman Karn, regent to Mineva Lao Zabi, and also continues to follow Captain Bright Noa and the ship, &quot;Argama&quot;, as well as introducing the new characters led by Judau Ashta.

This sequel to &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; sometimes struck a much lighter, often comical, tone, in contrast to its predecessor&#x27;s brooding drama. For example, in the second episode, the protagonist Judau Ashta attempts to help Yazan Gable by throwing oranges at the Argama. This is contrasted in the same episode however when Yazan kills the technician Saegusa, and Judau then attempts to pilot the Zeta Gundam to go after Yazan but is incredibly poor at combat in his first battle. The whimsical first opening theme song &quot;Anime Ja Nai&quot; (lit. &quot;It&#x27;s Not Anime&quot;) set the tone for the first half of the series. The second half of the series sports a more somber opening theme song &quot;Silent Voice&quot; to accompany a change in tone to the more serious.

==Plot summary==

As the continuation of &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, this series once again follows the story of the Anti Earth Union Group (AEUG) battleship &quot;Argama&quot; after &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;″s final episode. To fight off the Axis Zeon, now called the Neo Zeon, Captain Bright Noa recruits a group of teenage junk collectors led by the loudmouthed but powerful Newtype Judau Ashta to pilot the &quot;Argama&quot;″s mobile suits. Now sporting a line-up of the behemoth ZZ Gundam and the returning Zeta Gundam, Gundam Mk-II and the Hyaku Shiki, the group is nicknamed the &quot;Gundam Team&quot;. As such, this became the first of a number of Gundam series where a team of Gundam mobile suits fight alongside each other regularly. The climax takes place at Side 3 in the Battle of Axis.

Out of the major &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; characters, Captain Bright Noa and Axis leader Haman Karn are featured prominently in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ&quot;; Hayato Kobayashi, Kamille Bidan, Fa Yuiry, Wong Lee, Yazan Gable, Mineva Lao Zabi, and the children Shinta and Qum are featured in various episodes as well; Sayla Mass, who had appeared in the first series but had no speaking role in &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, also appeared in several episodes of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ&quot;; Char Aznable&#x27;s planned appearance was canceled when Tomino was given the go-ahead to do the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; film. Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s original plan for the show which involved Char&#x27;s return was never revealed, nor does Tomino himself remember it. Also, aside from the openings and story recap/preview episode, Amuro Ray does not make an appearance in the series either.

==Reception==
The series remains one of the more polarizing series in the franchise due to the lighthearted and campy tone of the first half of the series when compared to Zeta Gundam&#x27;s grittier tone. In 2016, to coincide with the show&#x27;s Blu-Ray release, Ollie Barder of &quot;Forbes&quot; referred to &quot;Gundam ZZ&quot; as a &quot;misunderstood and underappreciated classic.&quot; James Whitbrook of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; called &quot;Gundam ZZ&quot; &quot;the black sheep of early &quot;Gundam&quot;&quot;, citing the show&#x27;s early comedic tone in comparison to the dark ending of its predecessor.

<text>The San Antonio Texans were a Canadian Football League (CFL) team that played in the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, in the 1995 CFL season. They had relocated from Sacramento, California, where the team had been called the Sacramento Gold Miners. After relocating, the team still had the same ownership in Fred Anderson and the same staff, including President Tom Bass and Head Coach/General Manager Kay Stephenson. The Gold Miners/Texans franchise played three seasons (five if the Texans&#x27; WLAF iteration, the Sacramento Surge, is also counted) before folding in 1995. They were the southernmost team in CFL history and the only team in CFL history to have ever officially relocated from another market (the Baltimore Stallions and Montreal Alouettes are considered separate teams by the league).

==History==

Before the 1993 season, the CFL granted expansion franchises to the owners of two WLAF teams, the Sacramento Surge and San Antonio Riders. The Riders changed their name to the Texans to avoid confusion with the Ottawa Rough Riders and Saskatchewan Roughriders. However, the original Texans franchise folded without ever playing a down when its owner, Larry Benson, ran out of money and was forced to withdraw. In a second attempt to place a team in San Antonio, Larry Ryckman threatened to move the Calgary Stampeders to San Antonio for the 1995 season if Calgary fans did not buy 16,000 season tickets; the tickets were purchased, though Ryckman was forced to sell the team a year later.

The Surge changed their name to the Gold Miners, and played the 1993 and 1994 seasons in Sacramento. However, their home stadium, Sacramento State&#x27;s Hornet Stadium, was completely inadequate as a professional football venue. At the time, it consisted mostly of temporary-style bleacher seats, had few amenities and did not have permanent bathrooms. Additionally, it was uncovered, and thus offered no protection from Sacramento&#x27;s blistering summer heat. They were also relatively isolated from the rest of the league; for their first two seasons, their nearest opponent was the BC Lions, north.

Unable to persuade Sacramento State to upgrade Hornet Stadium to something approaching CFL standards, Anderson tried to build a new stadium, but those plans fizzled. Neither of the other two stadiums in the Sacramento area, Toomey Field and Charles C. Hughes Stadium, offered anything significantly better; like Hornet Stadium, they were both inadequate even for temporary use. The failure of the Las Vegas Posse after only one season left the Gold Miners once again isolated from the rest of the league. Faced with an inadequate stadium and an unsustainable travel situation, Anderson reluctantly opted to move the team to San Antonio as the Texans. The move brought the Texans closer to the league&#x27;s three Southern teams—the Birmingham Barracudas, Memphis Mad Dogs and Shreveport Pirates.

===On the field===
The Texans were unique in that their stadium, the Alamodome, had a playing surface large enough to accommodate a regulation Canadian football field. Although the facility had been designed primarily with American football in mind, its sideline seats could be retracted to create a playing surface wide enough for the full 65-yard width of a CFL field, and its end zone seating could be retracted to accommodate the full 150-yard length of a CFL field.

In their third season in the CFL and their first as the Texans, the team had the second-highest scoring offence in the league, which was led by veteran quarterback David Archer. The franchise finished the 1995 CFL season with a 12–6 record, finishing in second place of the South Division, which sent them to their first playoff berth.

In the playoffs, the Texans soundly defeated the Barracudas, 52–9, in the Southern Semi-Final at the Alamodome, in what was the only CFL playoff game ever held in an American city other than Baltimore. However, their playoff run would end with a loss to the eventual Grey Cup champion Baltimore Stallions in the Southern Final by a score of 21–11. As it turned out, it would be the last game the Texans would ever play, and (as of the 2015 season) the last meaningful CFL game ever played in the United States.

San Antonio&#x27;s two backup quarterbacks had connections to the National Football League″s (NFL) Buffalo Bills. The first was 45-year-old former Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson, who had retired five years earlier and came out of retirement when Dave Archer, the Texans&#x27; long-time starting quarterback, suffered an injury. The second was Jimmy Kemp, son of Bills quarterback (and politician) Jack Kemp. Head coach Kay Stephenson was Jack Kemp&#x27;s backup on the Bills squad in 1968 and served as head coach of the Bills during Ferguson&#x27;s last season with the team in 1984.

===Off the field===
The San Antonio Texans had respectable attendance, with the average being 15,855. In one of their games at the Alamodome, attendance reached 22,043, in a 38–32 loss to the Calgary Stampeders. The turmoil surrounding most of the other American CFL teams was not a significant factor in San Antonio.

===The end===
Anderson was heavily committed to the American CFL experiment. Indeed, by most accounts, he and the Baltimore Stallions&#x27; Jim Speros were the only truly dedicated American-based owners. When the experiment appeared to be in jeopardy near the end of the 1995 season, Anderson attempted to orchestrate a plan to save it. Under the plan, the Stallions, who were about to be forced out of Baltimore due to the pending establishment of the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Ravens, would have moved to Houston, a city that was about to lose their NFL team, the Oilers, and Speros would have sold a minority stake to Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane. Meanwhile, the Barracudas would have been sold to a new investment group and relocated to Shreveport to take the place of the Pirates. This would have matched up a team that made a good account of itself in its first season with a market that at least had the potential to support it. The &#x27;Cudas&#x27; attendance had dwindled to unsustainable levels once college football season started. In contrast, while Shreveport was the smallest American market in the league, it had proven it could support CFL football for a full season despite being saddled with one of the league&#x27;s worst teams both on and off the field. The plan would have concentrated the CFL&#x27;s American experiment in the Southwest, and the three cities would have been close enough to make both it and the three teams more viable. The proposal would likely have meant the end of the CFL&#x27;s South Division. The most likely alignment would have been to place the three U.S. teams in a re-constituted East Division, while the Winnipeg Blue Bombers would have returned to the West Division.

However, only two months after the Grey Cup, the Mad Dogs and Pirates had both folded. The Barracudas were about to be euthanized as well, as by then it was obvious the CFL would not approve their proposed sale and relocation to Shreveport. Speros was seriously considering moving his team to Montreal, in response to pressure from the league office. Anderson was not enamored at the prospect of being the only American owner in the CFL once again. He believed that the league needed at least three more American teams for the Texans to be viable in the long term. However, he was willing to play another season in San Antonio provided the Stallions stuck to their initial plan to move to Houston.

On February 3, 1996, the Stallions received formal approval to move to Montreal (they later reconstituted themselves as the third incarnation of the Montreal Alouettes) and the Texans were shuttered along with the Mad Dogs, Pirates and Barracudas. Anderson had little choice but to accept the euthanization of his team; earlier he had stated that he&#x27;d lost $6 million in 1995—far too much to make it worth the effort to go it alone. With the Stallions&#x27; move to Montreal, his nearest opponent would have been in Hamilton, over 1,400 miles away. With the Stallions opting to move to Montreal, there was no longer a viable place for Anderson to relocate had he decided to follow the Stallions&#x27; example. Although several other markets in Canada had expressed interest in joining the CFL, none had a stadium at the time that was suitable even for temporary use.

Malcolm Frank was the last remaining player from the Texans to play in the Canadian Football League when he was a member of the Edmonton Eskimos in 2006. He retired after that season.

<text>The Sacramento Gold Miners were a Canadian football team based in Sacramento, California. The franchise was the first American team in the Canadian Football League. The Gold Miners inherited a home stadium, front office staff and much of the roster of the Sacramento Surge from the defunct World League of American Football. The team played its home games at Hornet Stadium.

==History==
===On the field===
====1993 season====
When the WLAF suspended operations in 1992, Surge owner Fred Anderson received a franchise in the CFL after that league expanded to the United States in 1993. The two teams could be seen as one and the same. The two entities had the same colors (aqua and yellow) and head coach (Kay Stephenson). Additionally, several players and administrators made the switch from the WLAF to the CFL. These players included starting quarterback David Archer, Carl Parker (WR), Rod Harris (WR), George Bethune (DT), Mike Oliphant (RB) and Mike Pringle (RB). One notable team administrator was Jack Youngblood, who was the Gold Miners&#x27; Director of Marketing in 1993 and 1994, which was a similar post he held with the Surge in 1991 and 1992. Rick Mueller, the team&#x27;s wide receivers coach (after serving as a defensive assistant with the Surge) and later director of player personnel, later would become general manager of the Omaha Nighthawks in the United Football League.

When the 1993 CFL season started, the Gold Miners, with an all-US staff, took some time to learn the intricacies of Canadian football. But the team was fortunate enough to have leadership from Archer and got great plays from Harris. In their first season, the Sacramento Gold Miners entered the CFL history books by:

* Becoming the first American team to play in the CFL.
* Becoming the first American team to host a CFL game, against the Calgary Stampeders (losing 38–36) on July 17. 
* Becoming the first American team to record a win in the CFL, against the Saskatchewan Roughriders (winning 37–26) on July 24. (However, they were not the first American team to win against a CFL team—see below.)

It is sometimes stated that the Gold Miners were the first American team to play against a Canadian team and to play on Canadian soil when they were the guests of the Ottawa Rough Riders (losing 32–23) on July 7. However, in the 1950s and 1960s the National Football League and the CFL (and the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union, forerunner of the CFL&#x27;s East Division) played a series of exhibition games, all in Canada, with the NFL team winning all of those matches. The American Football League also played one game in Canada against a CFL team in 1961, with CFL&#x27;s Hamilton defeating AFL&#x27;s Buffalo, 38–21. Prior to that, the Columbus Bullies of the American Football League (1940) played the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1941 in a three-game series, which Columbus won, 2 games to 1.

The Gold Miners also entered the CFL record books by recording the most wins by an expansion team with 6 wins (the record was broken the following year by the Baltimore Stallions). The Gold Miners finished the season with a 6–12 record, which placed them in last place of the West Division. The positives for the franchise were the facts that they had a 5–4 home record and were ranked 5th in team defense. Harris was also selected as a member of the 1993 CFL All-Star Team, which showed signs that the team had a good mix of players and staff to improve on for the following season.

====1994 season====

In their second season, the Gold Miners were no longer the lone American team as the CFL introduced three new teams: the Las Vegas Posse, the Shreveport Pirates and the Baltimore Stallions (who were known as the CFLers when the NFL did not allow the Colts name to be used). The Gold Miners were once again a part of CFL history when they played against the Las Vegas Posse in Sacramento on July 8, 1994. The game was the first-ever game that involved two American-based teams in the CFL. Las Vegas won the game, 32–26.

The Gold Miners made a decided improvement from their 1993 inaugural season with a 9–8–1 record. They had a 5–3–1 home record and a 4–5 road mark. Sacramento was ranked fourth in team defense, behind Calgary, Edmonton and Baltimore — the teams with the three best records in the league. But the record was only good enough for fifth place in the tough West Division. The Miners would have finished fourth with a 10–7–1 record, if not for a poor call by the officials in the team&#x27;s last game of the season in Edmonton. Archer appeared to throw a game-winning touchdown pass to Freeman Baysinger, but the officials ruled that it had short-hopped into Baysinger&#x27;s hands. Replays showed that Baysinger had caught the ball cleanly. As it was, the Gold Miners finished one point behind the 10-8 Saskatchewan Roughriders for the last playoff spot in the West. As it turned out, this would be the last game the team would play in Sacramento.

===Off the field===
Despite a mediocre on-field record, the Gold Miners represented a serious attempt to form a viable professional football organization. Anderson and Baltimore Stallions owner Jim Speros were considered the only truly dedicated US CFL owners. Anderson&#x27;s longtime sidekick Tom Bass handled the day-to-day operations, while coach Kay Stephenson and GM Tom Huiskens handled the football side. As with the team, it took Stephenson some time to adapt to the Canadian game, but he was eventually successful.

However, the Gold Miners were hobbled by substantial off-the-field problems that ultimately proved too much to overcome. Since the San Antonio club that was also supposed to be a part of the 1993 expansion had folded, the Gold Miners were the only American team in the CFL during the 1993 season. Their nearest opponent was the BC Lions, over away. They had to market themselves, receiving no assistance from the CFL. This distance was partially lessened when the CFL added the Las Vegas Posse for the 1994 season, but that team&#x27;s collapse after only one season left the Gold Miners once again far isolated from even their American competitors (the only other American teams, Shreveport and Baltimore, were away, respectively).

Another drag on attendance was Hornet Stadium, which was well below the standards expected for a professional football team. At the time, it was made up mostly of temporary-style bleacher seats. It only had threadbare amenities, and fans were forced to use port-a-potties. The stadium was also uncovered, and offered no protection from Sacramento&#x27;s often oppressive summer heat. One area in which Hornet Stadium would prove to be ideal was field size; because it was built with a running track, it was relatively easy to accommodate the full length and width of the larger Canadian field (110 yards x 65 yards [with 20 yard endzones] vs 100 yards x yards [with 10 yard endzones] for the American field) within the track and only cut small portions of the corners, a situation accommodated at a few other Canadian stadiums as well. Attendance did hover around 15,000 per game, but it was widely known that as many as 2,000 of those 15,000 were given free tickets. In 1993 the average home attendance was 16,979, but in 1994 the average home attendance fell to 14,226.

Unable to persuade Sacramento State to upgrade Hornet Stadium to something approaching professional standards, Anderson tried to get the city to build a new stadium for the Gold Miners and his minor-league baseball club, the Modesto A&#x27;s. He planned to complete a project that had been started several years earlier to lure the then-Los Angeles Raiders to Sacramento, but had ended up being mothballed. Anderson, however, could not come to terms with the local governments. Years later, Sacramento State would upgrade Hornet Stadium to professional standards to accommodate the Sacramento Mountain Lions and the stadium would later be named after Anderson.

===Move to San Antonio===
Deciding that Hornet Stadium was inadequate even for temporary use, Anderson decided to look for a new home for the Gold Miners. However, the only other football stadiums in the area, Sacramento City College&#x27;s Charles C. Hughes Stadium (where the Surge had played in 1991) and UC Davis&#x27; Toomey Field, were similarly unacceptable. Hughes Stadium was ruled out because it was used by several high schools; the CFL plays many games on Friday nights, the same night as most American high school football games. Toomey Field seated just over 10,000 people—only half the minimum capacity for a CFL stadium. Even if it could have been expanded, it was only connected to Sacramento by way of the narrow Yolo Causeway. In any event, the CFL frequently plays on Saturdays.

Faced with an unsustainable travel situation and the lack of a suitable facility, Anderson moved the team to San Antonio as the Texans for the 1995 CFL season. San Antonio had the benefits of having a brand-new stadium, the Alamodome, and was geographically close to the American CFL clubs in Shreveport, Memphis, and Birmingham, greatly reducing travel burdens. The Texans only played one season in San Antonio before the CFL exited the American market.

== Seasons ==
==Radio and television==
Gold Miners games were broadcast on KFBK radio and KRBK-TV with Tim Roye and Lee Grosscup on radio and Grant Napear and Jack Youngblood on television. Roye replaced Youngblood as TV analyst in 1994 and former San Francisco Giants announcer David Glass became the Miners&#x27; radio play-by-play announcer.

<text>The Shreveport Pirates were a Canadian Football League team, playing at Independence Stadium in Shreveport, Louisiana, United States, in 1994 and 1995. Despite a relatively strong fan base, they were one of the least successful of the CFL&#x27;s American franchises on and off the field.

==History==
The Pirates were created when Bernard Glieberman and his son Lonnie, owners of the Ottawa Rough Riders, expressed a desire to move the struggling franchise to the United States. The CFL rejected this move, but engineered a deal in which the Rough Riders were essentially split in two. The Gliebermans received an expansion franchise in Shreveport, while a new ownership group took over the Rough Riders name, colours, and history.

General manager J. I. Albrecht hired John Huard as head coach, but the Gliebermans overruled him and installed Forrest Gregg as coach before the team took its first snap. They needed until week 15 to record their first victory, a 24–12 win over the Sacramento Gold Miners. After the historic victory, the team won two out of their last three games, but they still finished last in the CFL East Division with a 3–15 record. Albrecht resigned and sued Glieberman and the Pirates.

Top performers were wide receiver Charles Thompson with 641 yards receiving and three touchdowns and running back Martin Patton was the team leading rusher with 659 yards and eight touchdowns. Terrence Jones had 1,046 yards passing with four touchdowns and nine interceptions and Mike Johnson, of the University of Akron, passed for 1,259 yards and four touchdowns with 12 interceptions. The club averaged 17,871 fans per game (second-highest of the American teams, behind only Baltimore), and once the team snapped its losing streak, attendance rose near the end of the season, with a high of 32,011 for their season-ending victory over the Ottawa Rough Riders, a single-game attendance record for the American teams outside of Baltimore.

Shreveport averaged more than 26 points per game in 1995, but gave up more than 28 en route to a 5–13 record. Billy Joe Tolliver completed 252 of 429 passes for 3,440 yards and 14 touchdowns. His favorite target was fellow Texas Tech product Wayne Walker, who caught 51 passes for 790 yards. Curtis Mayfield led the team in receptions with 58 for 846 receiving yards and two touchdowns. The team&#x27;s leading rusher was former University of Miami player Martin Patton, who ran for 1,040 yards, third in the league. Kicker Björn Nittmo finished 46 of 53 in field goals and was sixth in the league in scoring.

==Fan support==
Despite their dreadful on-field record and the Gliebermans&#x27; mismanagement, the Pirates had a very loyal following. Shreveport was by far the smallest U.S. market to host a CFL team, and second smallest in the entire league after Regina, Saskatchewan. Also, the Shreveport market had four major college teams with large fan bases in the region–LSU, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, and Arkansas. On paper, this should have resulted in attendance severely dropping off once college football started, as was the case with the CFL&#x27;s other Southern teams, the Memphis Mad Dogs and Birmingham Barracudas. However, Shreveport was far enough away from the campuses of LSU, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, and Arkansas that high school football was the Pirates&#x27; biggest local sports competition in the second half of the season. As such, despite winning only eight games in their history, the Pirates&#x27; attendance remained roughly comparable with the established Canadian teams throughout their run.

==Demise==

The problems continued off the field as the Gliebermans tried to relocate the team to Norfolk, Virginia. However, officials there broke off talks after learning that Glieberman faced several lawsuits in Shreveport. Notable about the move to Virginia was &quot;the Great Tucker Caper&quot; when the City of Shreveport tried to seize Bernard Glieberman&#x27;s 1948 Tucker (which was on loan to a classic automobile museum in downtown Shreveport) for defaulting on debts related to the Pirates&#x27; lease at Independence Stadium, including payments for the scoreboard. Glieberman&#x27;s lawyer, Mark Gilliam, tried to escape with the car and hide the vintage auto, but he ran out of gas along the way. The police spotted him, and took the car back to the museum where it was being stored until the case could be settled. Norfolk was not interested in the team in any event due to the Gliebermans&#x27; poor business record.

By the end of 1995, anticipating that the Pirates would not continue beyond that season, a group of investors dubbing itself the &quot;Ark-La-Tex Football Association&quot; proposed purchasing the Barracudas and moving them to Shreveport. The Barracudas had compiled a winning record and made the playoffs, winning two more games than the Pirates had won in their entire existence. However, owner Art Williams had already decided not to bring the team back to Alabama once it became clear the Barracudas could not successfully compete with the state&#x27;s well-established college football programs for an audience late in the season. The Ark-La-Tex Football association bought the &#x27;Cudas from Williams for a significant discount, provided that the league approve the sale. The sale would have brought the team closer to the San Antonio Texans and what would have been the Houston Stallions (as Baltimore had proposed moving to Houston after the season) and created a three-team nucleus that would have made the CFL&#x27;s long-term presence in the U.S. viable. It would have also matched a team that made a good account of itself on the field with a market that was at least potentially capable of supporting it at the box office. 

Instead, on February 2, 1996, the CFL folded four of its American franchises and allowed the owners of the fifth, the Stallions, to resurrect the Montreal Alouettes, ending the CFL&#x27;s experiment south of the border.

==Aftermath==
The Gliebermans eventually re-emerged in the CFL owning the Ottawa Renegades. Like their previous efforts, the Renegades were a failure.

Some notable players include former New Orleans Saints running back Gill Fenerty and defensive end Dexter Manley. Kicker Björn Nittmo was also a fan favorite, both for making some very long field goals and for being friendly to the fans, often attending meetings of their booster club. Jon Heidenreich played two seasons with the club, and later became popular as a wrestler (WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship). Curiously, two players, Joe Montford and Elfrid Payton, later went on to fame as winners of the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award (added to this pair is Greg Stumon, who was a former winner of the same award). Uzooma Okeke went on to become one of the best linemen in the history of the Montreal Alouettes and won the 1999 CFL Most Outstanding Lineman award. He became a scout with the Alouettes in 2007.

The Pirates booster club was formed during the team&#x27;s first season to support the team, and remained active long after the team became defunct, spearheading various later attempts to get another professional football team in the Shreveport area.

<text>The Ottawa Rough Riders were a Canadian Football League team based in Ottawa, Ontario, founded on September 19, 1876. Formerly one of the oldest and longest-lived professional sports teams in North America, the Rough Riders won the Grey Cup championship nine times. Their most dominant era was the 1960s and 1970s, in which they won five Grey Cups. The team&#x27;s fortunes waned in the 1980s and 1990s, and they ultimately ceased operations following the 1996 season. Five years later, a new CFL team known as the Ottawa Renegades was founded, though they suspended operations in 2006. The Ottawa Redblacks, which own the Rough Riders and Renegades intellectual properties, joined the league in 2014.

==History==
=== 1876 – 1930 ===

The Ottawa Football Club was organized on Wednesday, September 20, 1876, where they won the first game they played on September 23 against the Aylmer Club at Jacques Cartier Square. The team&#x27;s colours were cerise, grey, and navy blue. The club adopted the name Ottawa Rough Riders on Friday, September 9, 1898, and changed its team colours to red and black. Since then, red and black have been Ottawa&#x27;s traditional sporting colours. Although in later years the name was said to derive from logging (or more specifically, the logdrivers who guided timber down the rivers), the team based its colours on Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s regiment in the Spanish–American War, which, with the date of the renaming, suggests that the name also comes from the war. The team changed its nickname to Ottawa Senators from 1925 to 1930.

Ottawa&#x27;s first Canadian championship came in 1898. The Ottawa Football Club transferred from the Quebec Union to the Ontario League that season. The Riders defeated the Hamilton Tigers 15–8 for the Ontario championship, then defeated Toronto Varsity, the Intercollegiate champions 7–3 and defeated Ottawa College 11–1 to win the Canadian championship. In those days, Ottawa athletes played in multiple sports and the Riders had athletes famous in other sports, such as Harvey Pulford and Frank McGee. The Riders and Ottawa College were the Canadian champions for the next several years, with the Riders defeating Brockville 17–10 in 1900, and defeating Ottawa College 5–0 in 1902, College being the 1901 Canadian champions. The Riders moved back to the Quebec Union, winning the 1903 Quebec championship, in a year where there was no playoff for the Canadian title. In 1905, Ottawa won the Quebec title, only to lose to the Toronto Varsity team 11–9 in the Canadian championship.

The club absorbed the Ottawa St. Pats when the Riders helped found the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union in 1907. The Riders won the IRFU championship in 1909 over the Hamilton Tigers, but lost in the Canadian final in Toronto to Toronto Varsity. The Riders declined and became uncompetitive during the 1910s, attributed to the First World War, and the lure of salaries in professional ice hockey meaning athletes chose hockey over football in Ottawa.

During the decline of the Riders, another Ottawa team, Ottawa St. Brigids, was on an ascent. St. Brigids, which played in the Ottawa City league, and later the Ontario league, was developing top talent. In 1923, St. Brigids and the Riders merged, with St. Brigids manager Jim McCaffery becoming the manager of the Riders. McCaffery was a member of the Riders executive for several decades. The team won the Grey Cup in 1925 and 1926, a time when they were known as the &quot;Ottawa Senators&quot;. In 1925, Ottawa defeated three-time defending champion Queen&#x27;s in the Eastern semi-final. Ottawa then defeated Winnipeg 24–1 in the championship, held in Ottawa, and defeated Toronto Varsity 10–7 in Toronto in 1926. The team was led by top players such as Eddie Emerson, Joe Tubman, Joe Miller, Jess Ketchum, Jack Pritchard, Harold Starr and Don Young.

=== 1930 – 1950 ===
The Riders went back into a decline after the championships. Again, another Ottawa team, the Ottawa Rangers, was developing talent and enjoying success, winning the Quebec title. The Riders absorbed the Rangers in 1933, getting Rangers stars Andy Tommy, Arnie Morrison and &quot;Fat Quinn&#x27;. That same year the Riders added more talent, bringing in American imports &quot;Windy&quot; O&#x27;Neil and Lorne Johnson. In 1935, the Riders added Roy Berry who was mysterious about his origins. The Riders defeated the Toronto Argonauts in the final two games of the Big Four schedule to deny Toronto the Big Four championship. On November 19, 1935, Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Mail and Empire&quot; accused the Riders of using an illegal player in those matches. Editor Edwin Allen stated &quot;Roy Berry&quot; was an alias for Bohn Hilliard, a Texas Longhorns footballer who had played semi-professional baseball. In February 1936, Amateur Athletic Union of Canada president W. A. Fry announced the suspension of nine members of the Ottawa team due to the Roy Berry incident.

In 1936, the Riders won the Big Four title defeating the Hamilton Tigers 3–2. The team progressed to the Eastern final against the Sarnia Imperials. The Imperials won the game 26–20 in a frozen battle held at Toronto&#x27;s Varsity Stadium. Since there was no western challenge that year, the Imperials became Canadian champions. The highlight of Rough Rider Joe Zelikovitz&#x27;s football career came in the Big Four game in Hamilton against the Hamilton Tigers on October 15, 1938, when he set the Big Four record with seven interceptions, a record that still stands unofficially compared to the CFL. The Riders next won the Big Four and Eastern title in 1939, but lost to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 8–7 in the Grey Cup game, held in Ottawa. In 1940, the Riders won the Big Four and Eastern titles, defeating Toronto Balmy Beach. The win over Balmy Beach carried the Canadian title, as the west refused the Canadian Rugby Union code.

The Big Four went out of existence during the Second World War, but the Riders were able to field a club in the Eastern Rugby Football Union, along with Balmy Beach, Montreal and the Argonauts. The Riders won the 1942 ERFU title over the Argonauts, but again lost to the Blue Bombers in the Canadian final, 18–16 at Varsity Stadium.

The ERFU folded and the Riders continued in the Ottawa City league until 1945 when the Big Four was restarted. During the Riders&#x27; time in the Ottawa City league, another team from Ottawa, the Trojans won the Ontario title, and in 1948 the Trojans were absorbed into the Riders.

=== The 1950s ===

The Rough Riders were pioneers in international play in the 1950s. In 1950 and 1951, Ottawa hosted the New York Giants in exhibition games; the Giants won both times, and NFL-CFL matches were not attempted again until 1959. In the first season of the CFL, the Ottawa Rough Riders and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats made history when they played the first regular season CFL game at Philadelphia&#x27;s Municipal Stadium on September 14, 1958 as Hamilton defeated Ottawa, 24–18. The Toronto Argonauts had played the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in Buffalo in an exhibition game in 1951, and the Argonauts later faced the Calgary Stampeders in another exhibition game in Portland, Oregon in 1992; and several CFL games with at least one Canadian team occurred in the United States during the CFL USA era of the early/mid 1990s.)

=== 1960s and 1970s ===

The 1960s and 1970s were the Rough Riders&#x27; glory years. With General Manager Red O&#x27;Quinn and Coach Frank Clair at the helm along with players Russ Jackson, Whit Tucker, Ron Stewart, Tom Clements, and Tony Gabriel, the Riders were one of the CFL&#x27;s best teams, winning the Grey Cup in 1968 and 1969 to finish out the decade and then two more under Clair as GM, including their last victory in 1976, where Tony Gabriel made the game-winning touchdown catch in the end zone in a 23–20 win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. The Rough Riders&#x27; final appearance in the Grey Cup game was 1981 against the heavily favoured Edmonton Eskimos. The game started out as a shocker when the Riders jumped out to a 20–1 halftime lead over the Eskimos. But a controversial double interference call against Riders receiver Tony Gabriel late in the game proved to be costly, as the Eskimos, led by backup quarterback Tom Wilkinson, came from behind to beat the Riders 26–23 on a game-winning field goal by kicker Dave Cutler, giving the Eskimos their fourth (out of five) consecutive Grey Cup championship.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s, except for two even (.500) records (8–8 in 1983 and 9–9 in 1992), the Riders struggled with losing seasons, poor ownership, mismanagement, and decreased fan support. In 1988, Jo-Anne Polak was named the co-General Manager of the Rough Riders. She became the first woman in CFL history to be appointed to an executive post, and the first female General Manager of any professional sports franchise in North America. Three years later, the team was purchased by Detroit businessman Bernard Glieberman and his son Lonie Glieberman, who became team president, for a dollar. The team changed its logo from a simple block &quot;R&quot; to a double flaming red and silver &quot;RR&quot;, and added silver to their traditional red and black colours. Despite a promising year in 1992 the bottom fell out in 1993, when the Gliebermans began making noise about moving the Rough Riders to the United States. The CFL, obviously, did not take kindly to Glieberman&#x27;s suggestion, but allowed him to split the Rough Riders into American and Canadian halves. The American half became an expansion franchise known as the Shreveport Pirates under Glieberman&#x27;s ownership. The Canadian half retained the Rough Riders name, colours and history under the ownership of modern Ottawa Senators co-founder Bruce Firestone. This arrangement is similar to the arrangement made by Art Modell and the Cleveland Browns made later in the 1990s.
For the 1994 season the team unveiled its final logo design with the team colours changing from black, silver, and red, to dark navy, red, and gold. The colour changes proved to be unpopular as the team dropped dark navy in favour of a return to black for the 1996 season. Despite the ownership changes, neither Ottawa nor Shreveport played well. In 1995, after a lengthy bankruptcy process in ownership, the Riders were purchased by Chicago businessman and minor league sports entrepreneur Horn Chen, who did not attend a single Riders game. In the dispersal draft of Las Vegas Posse players, Ottawa management drafted Derrell Robertson, who had died the previous December. Following the 1996 season, years of poor ownership and mismanagement took a toll on the Rough Riders franchise that ultimately led to its folding after a storied 120 years. After the Rough Riders folded, the CFL moved its easternmost-West Division team, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, back to the East Division for a second time to take Ottawa&#x27;s place and to balance out the divisions (they played in the East from 1987 to 1994, and the Bombers stayed in the East Division from 1997 to 2001; it returned there upon the folding of the Renegades from 2006 to 2013).

=== Two Riders ===
For much of the team&#x27;s history, it played in the same league as the Saskatchewan Roughriders, confusing many, and also attracting general ridicule to the CFL for being a league with only eight or nine teams, but two of them being named &quot;rough riders&quot; (spelled identically although configured differently; also, the Saskatchewan team&#x27;s nickname has a well-documented derivation that has nothing to do with the Spanish–American War or logging). For a time, both clubs shared the same colours of red and black until 1948, when the Saskatchewan team became green and white, which remain their colours to this day. The teams had historically belonged to separate leagues (&#x27;unions&#x27;) until the CFL was formed in 1958. When the CFL was formed, they were allowed to keep their long-standing names; Ottawa was frequently known as the &quot;Eastern Riders&quot; while Saskatchewan was referred to as either the &quot;Western Riders&quot; or &quot;Green Riders&quot;. On four occasions, the two teams met in the Grey Cup (1951, 1966, 1969, and 1976); Ottawa won all but the 1966 meeting, which was also Saskatchewan&#x27;s first Grey Cup in team history. The Riders vs. Riders matchups were often confusing for fans. Errors were occasionally made on the official scoreboard and commentators often got confused.

=== Ottawa Renegades ===
A CFL franchise in Ottawa was absent for the next five years until 2002, when the city regained a CFL team, named the Renegades. Although sentiment arose toward resurrecting the Rough Riders name, Chen expected payment for the rights to it; the new franchise declined the request, and went with a &#x27;fresh&#x27; name for the new team. The team also faced financial problems, ceasing play after the 2005 CFL season.

The Saskatchewan Roughriders opposed the CFL&#x27;s application to register &quot;Ottawa Rough Riders&quot; as a trademark, and the league abandoned the application in 2016.

=== Ottawa Redblacks ===
In 2008, a partnership of five Ottawa business leaders acquired the Ottawa CFL franchise rights with the intent of relaunching professional football in Ottawa. The CFL also acquired the Rough Riders intellectual properties from Chen. Because the Saskatchewan Roughriders enforced their trademark on the Rough Riders name, Ottawa&#x27;s new franchise was required to choose a new name. It took the field in 2014 as the Ottawa Redblacks.

Despite being denied the use of the Rough Riders nickname, the Redblacks do pay homage to the Rough Riders. The Redblacks&#x27; primary logo is a stylized version of the block &quot;R&quot; used by the Rough Riders from 1975 to 1991. The currently-used &quot;R&quot; is set within the outline of a saw blade, a nod to Ottawa&#x27;s logging heritage. In the Redblacks&#x27; first home game, they retired the 10 player numbers that the Rough Riders had retired.

For a few years, the CFL did not acknowledge the Redblacks (or for that matter, the Renegades) as the Rough Riders&#x27; successor in the same way it considered all three incarnations of the Montreal Alouettes as a single franchise. However, according to the 2017 CFL&quot; Guide and Record Book&quot;, the CFL now recognizes all three Ottawa-based clubs that played in the CFL or its predecessors–the Rough Riders, the Renegades, and the Redblacks–as &quot;a single entity&quot; dating to 1876 for record-keeping purposes, with &quot;two intervals of non-participation (1997–2001 and 2006–2013).&quot;

==Media personnel==
&quot;Ottawa Journal&quot; sports editor Bill Westwick poked fun at the team rather than criticize during their struggles in the mid-1950s. When coach Chan Caldwell suggested that the team could practice on a train ride to an away game by attaching a railway flatcar filled with dirt, Westwick played along with the joke although the plan never happened. A fellow journalist recalled that and Westwick reported on the idea with &quot;brilliant clarity and memorable hilarity&quot;.

Newspaper journalist Eddie MacCabe regularly reported on the Rough Riders, travelled with the team, and was the link between the players and the Ottawa community, and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

Notable radio broadcasters for the Rough Riders include Canadian Football Hall of Fame inductees Ernie Calcutt and John Badham.

<text>The BC Lions are a professional Canadian football team based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Lions compete in the West Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL), and play their home games at BC Place.

The Lions played their first season in 1954, and have played every season since, making them the oldest professional sports franchise in British Columbia. They have appeared in the league&#x27;s Grey Cup championship game 10 times, winning six, with their most recent championship occurring in 2011.

The Lions were the first Western Canadian team to win the Grey Cup at home, doing so in 1994 and 2011, before Saskatchewan achieved the feat in 2013. Also in 1994, the Lions became the first and only team to play and defeat an American-based franchise for the Grey Cup. The Lions hold the second-longest playoff streak in CFL history, making the postseason 20 consecutive seasons, from 1997 to 2016 (only Edmonton has had a longer playoff streak, going 34 seasons from 1972 to 2005). With the Winnipeg Blue Bombers Grey Cup win in 2019 after a 29-year wait, the Lions currently have the longest Grey Cup drought of the West Division teams, and the longest drought since appearing the Grey Cup, last playing and winning in 2011.

==History==

===Before the Lions===
Compared to the rest of the country, senior football arrived late in British Columbia. Rugby unions had been organized in all of the Prairie provinces by 1907 and the Western Canada Rugby Football Union had been formed in 1911.

However, it was not until 1926 (after the sudden collapse of the Western Hockey League) that the British Columbia Rugby Football Union was formed, and not until 1930 that the BCRFU competed to represent the West in the Grey Cup. The black and orange Vancouver Meralomas were the most successful British Columbian team of the era. They played in the Western Final in 1930 and again in 1934, only to lose on both occasions to the Regina Roughriders of the Saskatchewan Rugby Football Union.

The BCRFU stopped challenging for the Grey Cup following the formation of the Western Interprovincial Football Union. After the BCRFU disbanded in 1941, the Vancouver Grizzlies joined the WIFU. They played only one season, finishing 1–7, before the WIFU suspended operations for the duration of the Second World War. The Grizzlies did not return after the war.

===Origin of the Lions===
In 1951, a group led by Ken Stauffer and Tiny Radar were inspired by &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; columnist Andy Lytle&#x27;s article to start a new football team in Vancouver that would play in the WIFU. The ownership group sent Radar and Orville Burke to represent them at the off-season WIFU meetings to initiate Vancouver&#x27;s bid for a team. Radar and Burke were told to return to the meetings the following year with a $25,000 good-faith bond if they could generate sufficient interest in the Vancouver area. The first meetings were held at the Arctic Club in November and a committee headed by Burke and Harry Spring of the Meraloma Rugby Club, set out to sell memberships for $20 each.

Though Burke, Vic Spencer, and John Davidson offered the good-faith bond to the WIFU in 1952, the idea of having a Vancouver team was rejected when both Winnipeg and Saskatchewan voted against the idea of a fifth team. The group in Vancouver, however, did not give up their efforts to have a franchise in the WIFU.

On January 22, 1953, the first annual meeting of the club was held, and Arthur E. Mercer was confirmed as the club&#x27;s first president. Later in the year, Mercer, Bill Morgan, Bill Ralston, and Whit Matthews went back to the WlFU meetings. One of the founding members included Indo-Canadian businessman, Jab Sidhoo. This time, they sold the idea of a fifth Western team, and Vancouver was granted a conditional franchise. They were required to provide a 15,000-seat stadium, sell at least 6,500 season tickets, and guarantee travel expenses for the visiting teams.

All the pieces began to fall into place when it was announced that Vancouver would host the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. That entailed the building of Empire Stadium, which seated 32,300 people and would be more than suitable for the new WIFU team once the Games concluded. By Easter of 1953, Annis Stukus was then lured away from the Toronto Argonauts to return to the West to become the first public relations manager, general manager, and head coach of the franchise.

===Naming the team===
During the rest of 1953, a fan contest was held by all of the local media to pick the new team&#x27;s name. Lions was chosen because it represented a local landmark and legend of the area. The Lions are twin mountain peaks that rise northwest of Vancouver, and according to legend, resemble two mountain lions (cougars) guarding the city.

After the name was chosen, Stukus decided that the team should represent and embrace the entire province of British Columbia, introducing the team to the Canadian football world as the British Columbia Lions or &quot;BC Lions&quot; for short.

Native to BC, the mountain lion has a strong connection to team&#x27;s brand, as it is renowned for speed, courage and strength, and carefully respected as a remarkable, but dangerous predator. The new team&#x27;s logo combined this animal with the black and orange colours of the Meralomas.

====Indigenous recognition====

In 2021, the Lions embarked on a special project to support Indigenous residential schools and missing children by recognizing Orange Shirt Day, later known as the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation. Kwakwaka’wakw/Tlingit artist Corrine Hunt created a rendition the team&#x27;s logo in an Indigenous design to call attention to the families and survivors as a part of the Every Child Matters movement in the UK. This marked this first time attention was brought to the movement. The Edmonton Elks would follow suit shortly afterward. The remaining teams would join in the recognition in 2023 and 2024 with redesigned logos of their own.

==Notable seasons==
The BC Lions have won 13 Western Conference/West Division regular-season championships and played for the Grey Cup 10 times, winning six.

===First seasons (1954–1960)===
For their inaugural season in 1954, Stukus sold football fever on the streets of Vancouver. The team made history when they stepped on the field of Empire Stadium for their first home game, against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, on Saturday, August 28, 1954. Fullback By Bailey scored the first touchdown in franchise history in an 8–6 loss. The first Lions win came on September 18, 1954, with Bailey scoring the winning touchdown to overtake the Calgary Stampeders 9–4. Fans celebrated in the streets, but it turned out to be their only win, as the Lions went 1-15 for the year.

In 1955, the team improved to a 5–11 record, eking out fourth place ahead of Calgary, but missing the playoffs. In October, the team&#x27;s directors asked Stukus to step down as the team&#x27;s head coach. While fan reaction to his dismissal was loud and divided, Stukus asked the fans to continue their support of the BC Lions. Stukus&#x27; assistant Clem Crowe was later named head coach for the upcoming 1956 season.

In 1956, the Lions again finished fourth in the West and missed the playoffs, despite improving to 6–10 in Crowe&#x27;s first year.

During the offseason, Bill McMahan assumed the role of team president. One of his first duties involved him bringing back Kelowna native Herb Capozzi from the Montreal Alouettes as the new general manager. BC continued to struggle on the field, finishing the 1957 season with a 4–11–1 record, missing the playoffs for the fourth straight year.

1958 marked the beginning of the CFL era, but the Lions lost their first 5 games, en route to a league-worst 3–13 record. The team&#x27;s on-field struggles compelling Capozzi to fire Crowe as the head coach and replace him with Danny Edwards, who returned after playing with the club during the 1957 season. Although it was a season to forget, rookies Tom Hinton and Sonny Homer showed promising signs of being future football stars.

Capozzi improved the team for the 1959 season, first by hiring Wayne Robinson, from Winnipeg, as the new head coach, then bringing in a corps of veteran players to add more experience to the team. This was followed by signing rookie running back Willie &quot;the Wisp&quot; Fleming, adding more youth to play alongside Hinton and Homer. Capozzi&#x27;s moves proved successful. By winning their final regular season game, at home, over Calgary, the 1959 Lions managed both their first winning season, with a 9–7–0 record, first playoff appearance. The postseason ended with two straight losses to the Edmonton Eskimos, but the team&#x27;s future looked bright heading into the 1960s.

The high hopes of the Lions heading into 1960 faded and the team finished with a 5–9–2 record, which eliminated them from playoff contention again. It was disappointing considering the addition of rookie talents Steve Cotter, Lonnie Dennis, Jim Carphin, and Neal Beaumont to a strong core of veteran and young players from the previous season. The only positive for the Lions was Beaumont winningWIFU Outstanding Rookie of the Year honors, becoming the first Lions player to win a major CFL award.

===Dave Skrien and the first Grey Cup title (1961–1967)===
The Lions started the 1961 season by signing former Minnesota Golden Gopher Tom Brown, but the team continued performing poorly on the field.

In September, in a trade that was considered a major gamble, the Lions received quarterback Joe Kapp from Calgary, in exchange for four players. A week later, Robinson was relieved of his duties as head coach and replaced by assistant Dave Skrien. The year ended with a 1–13–2 record.

In 1962, Skrien made an immediate impact in his first full season as head coach, finishing with a 7–9 record. After eight years of hard work, the Lions were on the verge of success for the first time.

====1963 Grey Cup finalists====
Before the 1963 season, there was optimism that the Lions could contend for the Grey Cup. With a veteran roster headlined by Kapp and Fleming, the Lions surged to their first regular-season conference title with a 12–4 record. After a 2–1 series victory over the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Western Conference finals, the Lions lined up in the 51st Grey Cup, held at Empire Stadium, against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. However, their momentum stalled as a series of injuries in the championship game affected the team&#x27;s performance. Star running back Fleming was hurt after he received a late, out-of-bounds hit by Tiger-Cat defensive tackle Angelo Mosca. This proved to be a huge blow to the Lions&#x27; chances of victory. Hamilton took the Grey Cup, 21–10.

In the offseason, Kapp was awarded the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as most valuable player of the Western Conference, Tom Brown won the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award, and Skrien won the Annis Stukus Trophy as coach of the year, the first time any of those three awards had been handed to Lions players. Fullback-kicker Peter Kempf became the second Lion to win the Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy for rookie of the year honours in the Western Conference.

====1964 Grey Cup champions==== 
After achieving an 11–2–3 regular-season record in 1964, and defeating the Calgary Stampeders in a three-game series in the Western Conference finals, the Lions advanced to meet the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in a Grey Cup rematch at Toronto&#x27;s Exhibition Stadium. BC got their revenge, as Kapp, Fleming, and Bill Munsey, who gave a two-touchdown, two-way starring effort, helped the Lions to their first Grey Cup victory, 34–24. The win ended 11 years of waiting for the British Columbia faithful. At the end of the 1964 season, defensive lineman Tom Brown was named a CFL All-Star, a back-to-back Schenley Award winner as CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Lineman Award, and won the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player in the Western Conference. Joining Brown as All-Stars on defence were Mike Cacic, Dick Fouts, and Munsey. Kapp and tackle Lonnie Dennis were named CFL All-Stars on offence.

During the offseason, Bailey left, and the roster was beginning to age. Any hopes of the BC Lions becoming a dynasty quickly disappeared in 1965, as the team fell to fourth in the west with a 6–9–1 record, missing the playoffs one year after being on top of the CFL world. It was clear that head coach Skrien would never again experience the same success as he achieved the previous two seasons.

The situation went from bad to worse in 1966, as the Lions posted a 5–11 record. Capozzi was fired as general manager after nine seasons, and just two years after taking the franchise to consecutive Grey Cup appearances. Fleming and Tom Hinton retired, and Kapp left the team to continue his playing career in the NFL with the Minnesota Vikings.

In the 1967 season, Denny Veitch became the new general manager of the club. His first move was to fire Skrien after three straight losses to start the season. Veitch named Jim Champion as head coach, and the Lions ended up finishing the season with a 3–12–1 record. The only positives for the club were two rookies; wide receiver Jim Young and kicker Ted Gerela, who ended up winning the Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy as the Western Conference&#x27;s rookie of the year.

===Instability at coach (1968–1976)===
Following Skrien&#x27;s departure, the Lions went through five head coaches between 1968 and 1976, qualifying for the playoffs only three times. Champion remained as head coach in 1968, and CFL legend Jackie Parker was hired as an assistant coach, and even came out of retirement for eight games at quarterback. The Lions finished the season with a 4–11–1 record, again missing the playoffs.

Eleven games into the 1969 season, with a 1–10 record, Champion was fired as head coach and replaced by assistant Jackie Parker. The Lions responded by winning four of their last five games to finish 5–11, tied with Edmonton. By virtue of winning the season series, BC won the tie breaker and squeezed into the playoffs, where they fell to the Stampeders, in Calgary, 35–21 in the semifinal. Individually, Dave Easley won CFL and Western Division rookie of the year honours, and Young was a Schenley finalist.

In 1970, the first artificial turf field in Canada was installed, at Empire Stadium (3M&#x27;s Tartan Turf). Young became the first Lion to win the Schenley Outstanding Canadian Award, while the team finished fourth place in the Western Conference at 6–10, and missed the playoffs.

The 1971 season began with a major off-season restructuring that saw head coach Parker elevated to general manager, and replaced by former Saskatchewan coach Eagle Keys. Don Moorhead was recruited at quarterback, and a total of fifty-three different players put on a Lions uniform in a year of change, including movie and TV personality Carl Weathers at linebacker. Running back Jim Evenson finished the season with 1,237 yards to lead the Western Conference in rushing, and won the Eddie James Memorial Trophy. The Lions again finished the season at fourth place in the West Division with a 6–9–1 record, missing the playoffs for a second consecutive year. Parker became the first Lion player inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

In 1972, the Lions added new players such as defensive back Rocky Long, running back Johnny Musso, linebacker Ray Nettles and centre Al Wilson, but finished fifth in their division with a 5–11 record. Young won his second Schenley Award as outstanding Canadian.

The Lions&#x27; fortunes improved during the 1973 season, as they posted a 5–9–2 record, good enough for a third-place finish in the Western Conference and a playoff berth, their first in four years. The Lions lost in the semi-finals to the Saskatchewan Roughriders 33–13. Linebacker Nettles won the CFL&#x27;s Outstanding Defensive Player Award.

In 1974, the Lions showed continued improvement in posting an 8–8 record, and returned to the playoffs for the second straight year. They faced familiar foe Saskatchewan in the semi-finals, where they lost again, 24–14. Second-year running back Lou Harris replaced injured Musso to lead the Lions in both rushing and receiving, winning CFL All-Star honours in the process. Stukus became the first Lion inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame as a builder.

The Lions began the 1975 season with a change at quarterback, as Eric Guthrie and Peter Liske platooned at the position, replacing Moorhead. They lost five of their first six games before a major change was announced in August. General manager Parker and head coach Keys were both dismissed, with Bob Ackles moving up from his assistant general manager post and Cal Murphy elevated to head coach. The Lions played .500 football the rest of the season, but finished in fifth place in their division with a 6–10 record.

The Lions&#x27; 1976 season concluded with a 5–9–2 fourth-place finish. Individually, Sciarra became the second Lion to win the Schenley Award as the CFL&#x27;s most outstanding rookie, while Bill Baker won the Schenley Defensive Player Award. Harry Spring became the second Lion inducted into the Hall of Fame as a builder. Rookies and local talents, linebacker Glen Jackson and punter-kicker Lui Passaglia were two other bright spots in an otherwise disappointing season.

===Returning to contention (1977–1982)===
A complete off-season overhaul in the coaching staff brought Edmonton assistant Vic Rapp in as the 10th head coach of the Lions as they opened their 1977 season. A revamped Leos lineup included rookies Leon Bright, John Blain, Ken Hinton, and quarterback Jerry Tagge, as well as several newly acquired veterans. The Lions last-minute heroics earned them the nickname, the &quot;Cardiac Kids.&quot; They finished with a 10–6 record, good enough for second place in the Western Division—the first time the Lions had finished with a winning record since the Grey Cup year of 1964. BC opened the playoffs with a 33–32 upset of Winnipeg at home before being trounced 38–1 in Edmonton by the Eskimos in the Western Division final. Wide receiver Leon Bright captured the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Rookie award, and Al Wilson became the first Lion to win the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman Award.

In 1978, the Lions finished the season at 7–7–2 and in fourth place in their division. Rookie running backs John Henry White and Larry Key provided a much improved rushing game, but depth was still the missing ingredient, as the Leos missed the playoffs. 1978 also saw the emergence of rookie quarterback Joe Paopao, the &quot;Throwin&#x27; Samoan.&quot;

The Lions&#x27; 1979 season began with Tagge at quarterback, but his season—and his career—were ended by a knee injury. Led by Joe Paopao, the Lions skidded down the stretch, losing five games in a row. Despite this, the team finished third in the Western Conference with a 9–6–1 record, making the playoffs. In the semi-finals, the Lions were blasted 37–2 by the Calgary Stampeders. Jim Young retired at the end of the season, and Norm Fieldgate became the second Lions player to be inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. Rising costs and an aging Empire Stadium cast a shadow over future prospects. To head off a crisis, the directors, led by past-president Jack Farley, developed a plan to sell stock and seek a strong partnership with a major corporate sponsor to keep operations viable while waiting for the construction of a new stadium in downtown Vancouver.

The Lions failed to make the playoffs in 1980, despite a winning record of 8–7–1. Off the field, the decision was made to begin construction of a new indoor stadium in downtown Vancouver.

In 1981, the Lions returned to the playoffs with a third-place divisional finish and a 10–6 record. The team qualified for the playoffs on the final weekend of the season with a victory over the Saskatchewan Roughriders in a driving rainstorm at Empire Stadium. The key play was a late fourth-quarter fumble by Saskatchewan fullback Greg Fieger at the Rider two-yard line which the Lions recovered. The Lions turned this into a touchdown two plays later to take the lead for good after Saskatchewan had led for most of the game up to that point. In the playoffs, the Lions again upset the Blue Bombers 15–11 in the semi-finals before losing 22–16 in the Western Division final to eventual Grey Cup champion Edmonton. Paopao and second-year quarterback Roy Dewalt had wide-out Ty Grey as their deep-threat receiver, while rookie defensive back Larry Crawford led the CFL in interceptions. The Labatt Brewing Company became the Lions&#x27; major sponsor in a marketing agreement that brought much-needed financial stability to the team.

Standout wide receiver &quot;Swervin&#x27;&quot; Mervyn Fernandez was among the rookies who joined the Lions in 1982, winning the Jackie Parker Trophy as the Western Division&#x27;s most outstanding rookie. Despite a 9–7 record, the Lions finished fourth in their division and failed to make the playoffs. As in the previous four seasons, the Lions got off to a fast start only to stumble badly after Labour Day. In most cases after this point in the season, the Lions lost crucial divisional games by a very large margin. Due to this disturbing trend, head coach Vic Rapp and his entire coaching staff were dismissed at the end of the season. Lions&#x27; running back great Willie &quot;The Wisp&quot; Fleming was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

===A New Home, the New Western powerhouse (1983-1987)===

In January 1983, former Edmonton defensive coordinator Don Matthews was named BC&#x27;s new head coach. The Lions also moved into the domed BC Place Stadium, their new home stadium, which opened in June 1983. The quarterback-receiver combination of Dewalt to Fernandez led the Lions&#x27; attack, while the defence set a new CFL record of 42 interceptions. The Lions finished 11–5 for the second-best record in team history and returned to first place for the first time since the 1964 season. They stormed into the playoffs, defeating Winnipeg in the Western Division finals, 39–21. The Western Division champions hosted the Toronto Argonauts in the 71st Grey Cup, ending a 19-year absence from the classic. BC Place fans watched the Argonauts defeat their hometown team in a taut 18–17 contest.

In 1984, the Lions&#x27; biggest trade since the Joe Kapp deal brought CFL All-Star James &quot;Quick&quot; Parker to their defence from Edmonton. The Lions again finished first in the Western Division with a league-leading 12–3–1 record, but the second straight first-place finish was dampened by the late-season loss of quarterback Roy Dewalt to injury. In a repeat Western finals matchup at BC Place, Winnipeg triumphed 31–14 and went on to win their first Grey Cup since 1962. Average crowds in excess of 40,000 in each of the first two years at BC Place reversed the team&#x27;s financial fortunes, with stockholders receiving early repayment. Lions greats Joe Kapp and linebacker Tom Brown were inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

====1985 Grey Cup champions====
The Lions&#x27; 1985 season began with much promise. Mervyn Fernandez shattered several team receiving records and second-year receiver Jim Sandusky broke the 1,000 yard mark. Rookie defensive tackle Mike Gray was the most visible of several rookies. With depth and few injuries, the final season record of 13–3 was the best in team history, bringing the Lions their third consecutive first-place divisional finish. The Lions avenged their prior year&#x27;s playoff defeat by beating Winnipeg 42–22. One week later, the same Lions line-up met Hamilton at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal. Twenty-one years of waiting ended with a 37–24 Grey Cup championship victory over the Tiger-Cats in the 73rd Grey Cup. Quarterback Roy Dewalt won the Grey Cup&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award on offence, while defensive end James &quot;Quick&quot; Parker took home the Grey Cup&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award on defence. Kicker Lui Passaglia was named the Grey Cup&#x27;s Most Valuable Canadian. Don Matthews won his first CFL Coach of the Year award. Mervyn Fernandez became the first Lion to win the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player Award and defensive tackle Mike Gray won both the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Rookie award and the Jackie Parker Trophy. Linebacker Tyrone Crews won the first of two consecutive CFL Players Association Outstanding Community Service Awards. The CFL champions returned to Vancouver for a victory celebration that swept across the entire province.

Defending their championship in 1986 proved even harder than winning it the year before, as the Lions battled the Eskimos, Blue Bombers, injuries, and the CFL&#x27;s newly extended 18-game regular season. The Lions reached the halfway mark at 7–2 losing at Edmonton, and at home to Calgary. The Lions then ran their record to 9–2 before hitting a four-game losing streak, started by back-to-back losses to Edmonton. The Lions rebounded to win back-to-back games against Winnipeg to finish the season 12–6, and second in the Western Division. Under the new playoff format, the Lions met the Bombers for a third straight week, winning the Semi-Finals 21–14, before travelling to Edmonton for the Lions&#x27; first Western final road game in four years. The Lions lost their fourth game of the year to the Eskimos 41–5, ending the Lions&#x27; hopes of defending their title in front of a home crowd at BC Place. The 1985 Grey Cup title, the prospect of defending the title at home, and the excitement in the area generated from Expo 86 helped the Lions outdraw the Vancouver Canucks in total attendance in 1986, despite the fact the Lions had only nine regular-season home games compared to the Canucks&#x27; 40. Off the field, the big news of the year was the departure of general manager Bob Ackles to the NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys, ending Ackles&#x27; 33-year association with the Lions (he returned in 2002). Ackles was replaced by former Montreal general manager Joe Galat in August 1986.

The Lions began their 1987 campaign without the services of stand-out wide receiver Mervyn Fernandez, who left during the offseason to join the Los Angeles Raiders. The season began with a four-game winning streak, but the team seemed to lose focus through the middle of the season, looking invincible in one game and lethargic the next. Entering the last half of the year, the Lions were still in contention for first place but not playing like a team driving for a title. When the team suffered a three-game losing streak, general manager Joe Galat fired Don Matthews, the winningest coach in Lions history with just four games to go. The Lions instantly responded to new coach Larry Donovan, winning the final four games including a thrilling come-from-behind 33–32 victory over Edmonton at Commonwealth Stadium that many observers called the CFL&#x27;s greatest comeback ever. The win gave the Lions first place in the Western Division for the fourth time in five years with a 12–6 record. Home field advantage at BC Place in the Western final was not enough however, as the Lions fell to the eventual Grey Cup champion Eskimos, 31–7.

===Fading into mediocrity (1988–1992)===
The CFL&#x27;s competition cap forced the Lions to start the 1988 season with 22 new faces in their lineup, one of which was star quarterback Matt Dunigan, acquired in a trade with Edmonton. Despite the large number of new players, the Lions jelled and finished the regular season with a 10–8 record. The Lions entered the playoffs with momentum and were touted as Grey Cup favourites. The Leos managed hard-earned playoff victories on the road at Saskatchewan, beating the Roughriders, 42–18 in the semi-final, before defeating the Eskimos in the Western Division final at Commonwealth Stadium, 37–19; it marked their first playoff win over the Eskimos in their history. That set the stage for the 76th Grey Cup Championship Game against the Blue Bombers, in front of a crowd in excess of 50,000 in unseasonably mild but windy conditions at Ottawa. The lead changed hands several times during the hard-fought contest. The Leos drove to the Winnipeg seven-yard line in the final minutes only to have Matt Dunigan&#x27;s pass deflected by two defenders and intercepted to snuff out the drive. The Bombers went on to win the Cup, 22–21.

Buoyed by their Grey Cup appearance the previous season, the Lions entered the 1989 season with much optimism. However, the team opened the campaign with a loss to Edmonton in Commonwealth Stadium, followed by three more losses before coach Larry Donovan was fired and replaced by general manager Joe Galat. After dropping their fifth straight game to the Eskimos, the Lions put together a four-game winning streak, fuelling playoff hopes. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers shattered those hopes in back-to-back games, rolling over the Leos 53–34 in Winnipeg, and then edging the Lions 24–20 in an overtime contest in Vancouver. Prior to the Winnipeg home game on September 16, new owner Murray Pezim (who had bought the team from community ownership on September 7) and his minority partners, ex-NFL all-star Mark Gastineau and his wife Brigitte Nielsen were introduced to the home fans. The Lions never did get back on track, finishing the year with a disappointing 7–11 record, and missing the playoffs for the first time since 1982. Bright spots included running back Darrell Wallace, who won the Western Division&#x27;s Jackie Parker Trophy as Most Outstanding Rookie (Wallace was second in the CFL in total offensive yardage), and quarterback Matt Dunigan who won the CFL Players Association Outstanding Community Service Award. Dunigan was traded (in another seven-to-one trade) to the Toronto Argonauts after the 1989 season ended.

In 1990, Pezim&#x27;s first full season as owner, he made big changes to the look of the team. The team ditched its predominantly orange and white uniform design to black with silver helmets and pants. Under new head coach Lary Kuharich and general manager Joe Kapp, the Lions generated a good deal of preseason hype in 1990 with the signings of West Virginia University quarterback Major Harris, who was fourth in 1989 Heisman Trophy balloting, and quarterback Doug Flutie. Minority owner Mark Gastineau even returned to active duty, but was released after playing only four games. However, the publicity did not translate into on-field victories and turmoil plagued the team. Two coaches left early in the season amid controversy. The Lions tied their first game against Calgary in the dying seconds of the contest as Doug Flutie tossed a &quot;hail Mary&quot; pass to Ray Alexander in the end zone. The Lions kept close in every game, winning a tight one against Winnipeg at home on a last-second Passaglia field goal, while losing to Hamilton in the final seconds in the next contest. The eastern road trip to Ottawa and Toronto, during which the Lions lost both games, spelled the beginning of the end for the new coach and general manager. The following week, the Leos dropped another one to the Argos, 49–19, and one week after that, another former Lions great, Jim &quot;Dirty Thirty&quot; Young, was behind the bench as interim head coach. Bob O&#x27;Billovich took over as vice president of football operations and head coach on September 14, 1990, and promptly guided the team to a strong 34–4 victory over Hamilton. The Lions gained stability as the season wore on, and although they missed the playoffs, &quot;Obie&#x27;s&quot; charges went 4–3 over the last seven games of the season, and their strong finish fuelled hopes for a much brighter 1991 season. Highlights of the year included Lui Passaglia&#x27;s new professional football scoring record, as he booted his 2,238th point, finishing the year with 2,312 points. Lui also became the longest-playing Lion in history, appearing in a total of 236 games, overtaking Al Wilson&#x27;s previous mark of 233 games.

The 1991 season opened with promise. Although the team dropped a 39–34 decision to Calgary at BC Place, the game was tight and the Lions were in the contest to the very end. It was a harbinger as Bob O&#x27;Billovich&#x27;s young team with 12 rookies in the lineup, turned virtually every contest into a nail-biter, playing in a CFL record six overtime contests, winning three and losing three. Behind the outstanding quarterbacking of Doug Flutie, the powerful running of rookie Jon Volpe, the receiving of rookie Matt Clark and veteran Ray Alexander, the Lions were capable of beating any team in the CFL. On August 1, 1991, the 2–1 Lions faced the undefeated Toronto Argonauts featuring Raghib &quot;the Rocket&quot; Ismail, at BC Place Stadium. A huge crowd of 53,527 was on hand. After falling behind 21–3 in the first quarter, the Lions battled back and took control of the game in the final quarter. Toronto managed to tie the game but in overtime, but an electrifying kickoff return for a touchdown by Raymond Ethridge and terrific play by the Lions&#x27; special teams spelled the difference. The Lions triumphed 52–41 in overtime. However, the following week, Calgary stopped the Leos, 34–30 in overtime. The Lions offence led the CFL in 11 different categories and the team was in a three-way battle with Calgary and Edmonton for first place in the Western Division, right down to the end of the season. In the last game, the Lions hosted the 2–15 Hamilton Tiger-Cats, needing a win to clinch first place. However, the Lions lost and finished third with an 11–7 record. In the Western semi-final in Calgary, the Leos took a commanding 31–15 lead by the end of the first half. Although the Lions had never lost a game all year when leading at the half, Calgary stormed back with an incredible third quarter, scoring four touchdowns, and holding off the Lions to win, 43–41. The disappointing loss was at least partially offset by the awarding of three Lions with outstanding player awards. Doug Flutie was named the CFL&#x27;s Outstanding Player, Jon Volpe won the CFL&#x27;s Outstanding Rookie award as well as the West Division&#x27;s Jackie Parker Trophy and the Eddie James Memorial Trophy for leading the division in rushing. Offensive tackle Jim Mills became the CFL&#x27;s Outstanding Offensive Lineman and the West Division&#x27;s DeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy award winner for the second consecutive year. Although quarterback Doug Flutie signed as a free agent with the Stampeders in the post-season, the acquisition of his replacement from Calgary, Danny Barrett, prior to training camp, brought hope of good things to come in 1992.

The Lions entered training camp in 1992 with high expectations. Despite the loss of Doug Flutie, two-time Grey Cup finalist quarterback Danny Barrett was counted on to be an able replacement. In the season opener against Edmonton, however, Barrett struggled, eventually giving way to back-up Tony Kimbrough in the second half. The Eskimos went on to win, 37–26. The following week, the Lions&#x27; fortunes continued to spiral downward, this time, on the road, as the Toronto Argonauts crushed the Leos, 61–20. In the third game of the year against Doug Flutie and the Calgary Stampeders, Barrett, who had regained his starting job at quarterback, went down in the third quarter with a separated shoulder. Flutie then guided Calgary to a 37–19 win, and the Lions slid further downhill from there. The team lost eight straight before finally edging out Ottawa 33–27 on September 3, 1992, with Danny Barrett back at the helm. To add insult to injury, off-season and off-field problems emerged to swing focus from football to ownership, as Lions&#x27; owner Murray Pezim declared bankruptcy, and the CFL was forced to take over the team. Three weeks later, a new owner was found, as The Brick Furniture Store owner Bill Comrie purchased the Lions from the CFL on September 23, 1992. The team on the field did not respond to the newfound ownership stability, losing the final seven games of the year to finish the season with a disappointing 3–15 record. Head coach O&#x27;Billovich and his staff were fired at season&#x27;s end, and on December 12, 1992, new general manager Eric Tillman announced the hiring of Ottawa defensive coordinator Dave Ritchie, as the new head coach of the Lions.

===Another Grey Cup (1993–1995)===
The &quot;new&quot; 1993 edition of the BC Lions, under the guidance of head coach Dave Ritchie and general manager Eric Tillman signed a number of proven CFL veterans, including Danny McManus, James &quot;Wild&quot; West, Rob Smith, Less Browne, Tyrone Jones, Sean Foudy and CFL All-Star Vic Stevenson, winner of the 1992 DeMarco-Beckett Trophy as the Outstanding Offensive Lineman in the West Division. The team also added promising rookies, such as running back Cory Philpot, draft pick Tom Europe, and Derek Grier. A contract dispute with Jon Volpe kept him from training camp, but he was back in the fold by the second game of the season. The Lions struck quickly with wins over Saskatchewan and Toronto before grinding to a halt in Winnipeg after only three days rest between road games. However, the Leos lost only two more games through July, August, and mid-September, cruising to an 8–3 record, the Lions&#x27; best start since 1987. Quarterback Danny Barrett broke the CFL&#x27;s single-game passing yard record, completing 30 passes for 601 yards, eclipsing the previous mark of 586 yards set back in 1954 by Alouettes legend, Sam &quot;The Rifle&quot; Etcheverry. The Lions entered the September 18, 1993 game against Calgary in a battle for first place in the Western Division. However, Doug Flutie and the Stamps prevailed, 40–21. The Lions went on to win only two of the next seven games, sliding to a 64–27 pounding against Sacramento in the regular-season finale, for a 10–8 finish. Nevertheless, the Lions made the playoffs after a one-year absence, facing Calgary in the West Division semi-final game on November 14, 1993. Despite generating twice as much offence as the Stamps, the Leos could not score a touchdown and fell 17–9.

====1994 Grey Cup champions====
The Lions entered the 1994 campaign with a new quarterback, Kent Austin, at the helm. Off-season trades with Ottawa provided offensive guard Denny Chronopoulos, defensive lineman Andrew Stewart, and rush linebacker Angelo Snipes. A group of young, unknown, and aggressive linebackers emerged at training camp, Henry Newby, Tyrone Chatman, and Virgil Robertson, while the secondary was strengthened with the additions of Charles Gordon and Enis Jackson. The Lions opened the season at B.C. Place and gave the fans a taste of things to come with a hard-fought 24–20 victory over Winnipeg. The Lions offensive power was amply demonstrated the following week with a 57–18 thumping of the Ottawa Rough Riders. By the end of August, 1994, the Lions were 7–1–0, and had broken several single-game offensive records, including a 67–15 point record win over Shreveport. The Leos&#x27; secondary was further bolstered by the signing of former NFL stars James Jefferson (who was also a one-time CFL star) and Barry Wilburn. The team endured a dry spell at the season&#x27;s midpoint, losing close games to Winnipeg, Edmonton, Saskatchewan, and Baltimore. A late-season win over Las Vegas (45–7) and a close 24–23 loss to Calgary, gave the Lions new hope heading into the playoffs, as well as an 11–6–1 regular-season finish. The team travelled to Edmonton for the Western Division Semi-Finals, where the Lions had only managed one playoff victory at Commonwealth Stadium. With just over four minutes left in the game, defensive back Charles Gordon&#x27;s miraculous end-zone interception stopped the Eskimos in their tracks and gave new life to the Lions. Quarterback Kent Austin, replacing an injured Danny McManus who had started the game, mounted a Lions&#x27; drive which ate up the clock and the field. Lui Passaglia kicked the winning field goal with 30 seconds left to give the Lions a tough 24–23 come-from-behind victory. The following week, in one of the most memorable CFL games ever, the Lions and the Doug Flutie led Stampeders traded touchdowns and field goals all night at McMahon Stadium. In the swirling snow with two minutes left in the game, Calgary, who led by 5 points, set up to kick a field goal. Lions&#x27; wide receiver Ray Alexander leapt up and made an amazing block, giving the Lions renewed hope and decent field position. Danny McManus, who had replaced Kent Austin in the second half after Austin re-injured a separated shoulder, staged a furious last-minute drive, hitting receivers all the way down the field to the Stampeder&#x27;s four-yard line. With Calgary leading 36–31, with four seconds left in the game, McManus found receiver Darren Flutie alone in the end zone to give the Lions their first playoff victory over Calgary in 30 years, and a berth in the Grey Cup against Baltimore at B.C. Place. The dramatics continued the following week in the 82nd Grey Cup. With 55,097 cheering fans looking on, the Lions and Stallions staged another thriller with both teams playing great football. Baltimore took a 17–10 lead at halftime, and extended their lead to 20–10 early in the third quarter. Lions&#x27; quarterback Danny McManus entered the game and staged a second-half rally. Seemingly stalled at the Baltimore 30 yard line, Lui Passaglia and Darren Flutie staged a fake field goal to gain a big first down, which changed the momentum of the game. McManus ran in from the two-yard line to tie the score at 20–20. After the teams traded field goals to make the score 23–23, McManus engineered another late-game drive to the Baltimore 37 yard line. Passaglia missed the field goal with just over one minute remaining, but the Lions&#x27; defence rose up to deny Baltimore and stop them cold within their own five-yard line. After a punt and a couple of runs to set up another field goal try, Passaglia converted a field goal with no time remaining on the clock to give the Lions an incredible 26–23 victory, the third Grey Cup championship in the team&#x27;s history. Passaglia went on to win a well-deserved Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian award for his heroics.

The 1995 season began with Grey Cup hero Danny McManus named as starting quarterback, replacing Kent Austin, who was traded to Toronto. Shelton Quarles was added to a strong linebacker corps. The season started with an exciting, late come-from-behind 37–34 victory over the Baltimore Stallions at BC Place. The Lions won their first three games before suffering a setback in Calgary. The Leos got back on track with a strong performance over Ottawa, and went on to a 7–1 record, challenging the Stampeders in the North Division. Injuries to key players during a three-game, 10-day road trip resulted in a late-season swoon that the Lions could not recover from. A victory over Saskatchewan at B.C. Place in the regular-season finale solidified 3rd place in the rugged Northern Division with a 10–8 record and a trip to Edmonton for the playoffs. The Lions&#x27; 1995 season came to an end with a 26–15 loss to the Eskimos in the semi-finals. Individually, Lions&#x27; running back Cory Philpot broke the CFL record for touchdowns in a season with 22, and won the Eddie James Memorial Trophy for the second year in a row as the Northern Division&#x27;s leading rusher. Lui Passaglia ended the season with 3,160 career points. Jamie Taras won the DeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy as the Northern Division&#x27;s Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman.

===Staying in contention (1996–2002)===
1996 was a season of turmoil for the Lions, both on and off the field. Former Lions&#x27; quarterback and fan favourite Joe Paopao returned to the team from the Edmonton Eskimos as the new head coach, replacing Dave Ritchie. On March 11, 1996, Lions&#x27; owner Bill Comrie announced that the club had been sold to a group of 10 local businessmen headed by Nelson Skalbania (who once owned the Montreal Alouettes) and Michael Jensen. The Lions held training camp at UBC with over a hundred players invited. Mike McCarthy arrived in Vancouver to become the Lions new VP of football operations. On the field, the Lions started the season with 18 new faces in the line-up, including heralded Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware at quarterback. The Lions started the season at 0–4, and quarterback Damon Allen was signed to replace Ware. As the team stumbled on the field, attendance plummeted. Stability in the front office proved short-lived, as Skalbania and his ownership group lost control of the team, and the Lions (again) went into receivership, with the CFL taking over the team once more, just as they had in 1992. The bright spot of the season was an exciting and improbable, 35–11 victory over Doug Flutie and the Toronto Argonauts, in September, 1996. On October 31, 1996, Hamilton businessman David Braley announced his intention to buy the team. November 2, 1996 marked the end of the season as the Lions defeated Ottawa 35–24 in what was the Rough Riders&#x27; final game in club history.

David Braley&#x27;s ownership and a coaching change brought the Lions much-needed stability as they entered the 1997 season, and some of that stability seemed to have translated to success on the field. Joe Paopao resigned prior to the season&#x27;s start, and was replaced as head coach by Adam Rita. The Lions made the playoffs for the 20th time in their 43-year club history, despite an 8–10, fourth place divisional finish. The Leos&#x27; 1997 playoff appearance marked the first time in CFL history that a West Division team participated in an East Division semi-final, under a newly established &quot;cross-over rule&quot; (where the fourth-place team from one division qualified for the playoffs, as long as the team earned more points than the 3rd place team from the opposing division. Once so qualified, the fourth-place team would then &quot;cross-over&quot; to the other division to play the second-place team in the opposing division). The Lions thus faced Montreal in the Eastern semi-finals, eventually losing to the Alouettes, 45–35, in a spirited contest. Fullback Sean Millington was awarded the CFL&#x27;s Outstanding Canadian Award at season&#x27;s end, while linebacker B.J. Gallis won the Jackie Parker Trophy as the West Division&#x27;s top rookie.

The Lions started the 1998 season off on the wrong foot, losing their first three games, before finally beating Saskatchewan in week four. The defence held their own, but the offence struggled. The low point of the year occurred on August 9, 1998, when the eventual Grey Cup champion Calgary Stampeders came into B.C. Place and beat the hometown Leos 55–9. With a record of 3–6–0, head coach Adam Rita resigned, and was replaced by Greg Mohns. The no-nonsense approach of Mohns seemed to spark the team, as the Lions embarked on a memorable, six-game winning streak (which the team had not done since 1986) heading into the playoffs. The Lions, who finished 9–9 on the year, lost in the semi-finals to Edmonton in heartbreaking fashion, but showed promise for the upcoming season. Kicker Lui Passaglia won the Dave Dryburgh Memorial Trophy as the top scorer in the West Division.

Expectations for the Lions were high as the 1999 season began, following the team&#x27;s promising finish a year earlier, and with the announcement that the Grey Cup game would be played in Vancouver. Quality free agents such as slotback Don Blair and cornerback Eric Carter were brought in to add depth to an already impressive lineup, and with the likes of Robert Drummond and Jimmy &quot;The Jet&quot; Cunningham back in form following injury-plagued 1998 seasons, the Lions were primed for a successful season. The Lions started fast out of the gate, winning their first three games to set a new club record with nine straight regular-season wins. The Lions either held sole possession of first place or were tied with Calgary throughout the season. The Lions ended the regular season with two straight wins, finishing first in the division with a 13–5 record, the Lions&#x27; best record since 1985, and the first divisional championship since 1987. the Lions&#x27; dream season came to a premature and heartbreaking end, as the Stamps beat the Lions 26–24 in the Lions&#x27; first home playoff game in 12 years. The Lions appeared to be driving toward a chance to kick a game-winning field goal in the last minute before Damon Allen fumbled the ball at mid-field, allowing the Stamps to kill off the remaining time. The Lions fielded three CFL All-Stars in 1999: slotback Jimmy Cunningham, centre Jamie Taras, and defensive tackle Johnny Scott. Linebacker Paul Lacoste was voted the CFL&#x27;s top rookie, and was also awarded the Jackie Parker Trophy. Defensive end Daved Benefield was named the Western Division&#x27;s top defensive player, while Jamie Taras won the DeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy as the West&#x27;s most outstanding offensive lineman, as well as the CFL Player&#x27;s Association Outstanding Community Service Award.

====2000 Grey Cup champions====

The Lions began the 2000 campaign with only one goal in mind: win the Grey Cup. Six months later, the Lions fulfilled that destiny, but the path to the 88th Grey Cup was one of the most adventurous, unpredictable, and memorable ever in CFL history. The year started well enough, with victories over Hamilton and Saskatchewan, but a 35–2 loss to Calgary began a four-game losing streak and a lot of finger-pointing. A win over the Toronto Argonauts halted the slide, but following the game, head coach Greg Mohns resigned to join the upstart XFL. Long-time CFL coach Steve Buratto, who joined the club only two weeks earlier as a receivers coach, was promoted to the top job, and got instant results with a huge 51–4 win over the Argos in the second of back-to-back games. Despite a promising start, the Lions only won one of their next five games to sit at 5–9 on Thanksgiving. Nevertheless, the Lions came together when it counted the most, winning three of their last four heading into the playoffs, and the offence gelling to become the best in the CFL that season. Quarterback Damon Allen broke Ron Lancaster&#x27;s CFL record for career passing yardage. Lui Passaglia played in a memorable, &quot;Luv Ya Lui&quot; night at his final game at B.C. Place, and also set a CFL record for single-season field goal percentage. The Lions finished the year 8–10 and in third place in the Western Division, but were the team other teams did not want to face in the playoffs. A snarly defence started to show its grit, and the Lions roared confidently into Edmonton and emerged with a 34–32 Western semi-final victory, thanks to a Passaglia field goal on the final play. The Lions next faced Calgary in the Western finals, and the Lions steamrolled to a decisive 37–23 win. The Leos&#x27; Cinderella season came to a close on November 26, 2000, in the Grey Cup at McMahon Stadium in Calgary, as the Lions won their fourth championship in team history with a nail-biting 28–26 victory over the Montreal Alouettes. Running back Robert Drummond won the Grey Cup&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award, while backfield teammate Sean Millington took home the Grey Cup&#x27;s Most Valuable Canadian trophy. The Lions&#x27; triumph marked the first time a team with a sub-.500 regular season record won the Grey Cup, and it signalled a marvellous end to Lui Passaglia&#x27;s outstanding, 25-year CFL career. The 2000 Grey Cup championship team was inducted onto the BC Lions Wall of Fame on Sept 13, 2024. 

Expectations were high for the CFL champion Lions in 2001, but the team ultimately never seemed to jell. Quarterback Damon Allen struggled, and the team hovered around the 0.500 mark all season. Finishing at 8–10, the Lions did make the playoffs, but were immediately bounced by Calgary in the Western Division semi-finals, 28–19. Matt Kellett became only the second full-time field goal kicker in 26 years, as he replaced the legendary Lui Passaglia. Rookie middle linebacker Barrin Simpson led the team in tackles and was named a first-team CFL All-Star, as well as the CFL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year and Jackie Parker Trophy winner. Cornerback Eric Carter was also named to the CFL&#x27;s 2001 All-Star team.

Bob Ackles returned to the Lions as president and CEO before the 2002 season, which saw the Lions finish at 10–8 for a third-place finish in the Western Division, and the return of Adam Rita as head coach. The Lions faced Winnipeg in the Western semi-finals, falling 30–3 to the Bombers. Individually, Eric Carter and Barrin Simpson repeated as CFL All-Stars, while slotback Jason Clermont won CFL&#x27;s most outstanding rookie award, as well as the Western Division&#x27;s Jackie Parker Trophy. Fullback Sean Millington won the Dr. Beattie Martin Trophy as the outstanding Canadian Western Division player, for the 3rd time. This was the last season that Damon Allen played for the Lions, as he finished as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in passing yards, pass completions and passing touchdowns.

===Buono era (2003–2011)===
The 2003 season marked the beginning of a new era, as Wally Buono replaced Adam Rita as head coach and GM. The Lions also acquired former Stampeders and NFL QB Dave Dickenson through free agency, which prompted Lions QB Damon Allen to leave for the Toronto Argonauts. The Lions finished in a 3-way, 2nd place tie at 11–7 with Western Division foes, Winnipeg and Saskatchewan, and faced the Eastern Division&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts by way of the CFL&#x27;s &quot;cross-over rule.&quot; The Lions closed out the season with a 28–7 loss to the Argos in the Eastern Division semi-finals. Barrin Simpson appeared as a CFL All-Star for the 3rd year in a row, joined by newcomers Ray Jacobs on defence, and electrifying slotback Geroy Simon on offence. Wide receiver Frank Cutolo won the CFL and Western Division rookie of the year awards. Offensive tackle Steve Hardin won the CFL Player&#x27;s Association Outstanding Community Service Award.

The 2004 season marked one of the Lions&#x27; best regular-season records in club history. Going 13–5 and finishing 1st in the division, the Lions set a team record of 8 consecutive wins in a single season. In addition to club records, the season brought an array of individual performances to the forefront. Quarterback Casey Printers set a CFL record for highest single-game completion average of 90.9% (completing 20 of 22 passing attempts) during an August, 2004 game against Hamilton. Outstanding slot back Geroy Simon tied three team records by catching four touchdown passes in the same game. After the conclusion of the regular season, Printers was named the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player, while Jason Clermont won the Most Outstanding Canadian award. Printers and Simon joined 4-time All-Star linebacker Barrin Simpson as 2004 CFL All-Stars. The Lions, receiving a bye in the first round of the playoffs by virtue of their first-place divisional finish, faced one of their biggest rivals, the Saskatchewan Roughriders. In a closefinish, the Lions defeated the Roughriders 27–25, in overtime. The Lions were then pitted against the Toronto Argonauts in the 92nd Grey Cup Championship, a rematch of the 2003 semi-finals. The Lions did not exact their revenge, losing 27–19. Jason Clermont won the Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian award in the effort. The game was marked with controversy for the Lions, as Dave Dickenson got the start over Casey Printers, who had led the team through most of the season as Dickenson was injured.
Before and during the 2005 season there was controversy as to which quarterback should be the starter, Casey Printers or Dave Dickenson. Printers was the CFL&#x27;s 2004 season Most Outstanding Player, but Dickenson was a veteran star destined for the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. The team ultimately chose to go with Dickenson, despite his having been somewhat injury-prone. The Lions came out of the gate roaring. Led by Dickenson and an outstanding receiving corps, the team strung together 11 consecutive wins. The final game of the win streak came on September 17, 2005, when the Leos squeaked past the Montreal Alouettes by a score of 27–26 when Don Matthews elected to go for a two-point conversion rather than tie the game. The Lions bid for an undefeated season came to a halt the very next week on September 24, 2005, when the Edmonton Eskimos defeated the Lions 37–20 at Commonwealth Stadium. Dickenson sustained a season-ending concussion and Printers took over as starting QB. The Lions won only one of their remaining seven games of the regular season. On November 20, 2005, the Lions lost in the Western Finals to the eventual Grey Cup champion Eskimos at B.C. Place. The game ended with a controversial &quot;non-call&quot; on the last play of the game; as what would have been Printers&#x27; game-winning pass to slotback Geroy Simon appeared to have been interfered with by a defending Eskimo, and was ruled incomplete. Defensive end Brent Johnson was named a 2005 CFL All-Star, and won the Outstanding Canadian Award.

====2006 Grey Cup champions====
The 2006 season saw Casey Printers go off to the NFL&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs; however, a new quarterback controversy of sorts threatened to develop. During the off-season 2005s third-stringer, Buck Pierce won the back-up role and early season injuries to Dave Dickenson forced him into action. Pierce&#x27;s best game as the starter was on October 6 against the Calgary Stampeders, where he threw 25 for 31 for 297 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception. He began the game with one incomplete pass, and then hit his next 14.
The Lions in the off-season also acquired former Roughrider Paul McCallum to stabilize the kicking game which had not recovered from Lui Passaglia&#x27;s retirement in 2000. After a sluggish 2–3 start in 2006, coach Buono signalled that no starting job was safe by releasing runningback Antonio Warren and defensive back Sam Young. The team responded by winning the next six games. New running back Joe Smith ran for over 100 yards in his first game. Brent Johnson, Barron Miles, and Mark Washington led a dominant defence; 10 different defenders scored touchdowns on turnovers. They also held opposing offences to 17 points or less on 6 occasions. Receiver Geroy Simon dominated opposing defensive backs in a manner not seen since Mervyn Fernandez in the 1980s, and broke the club record for single-season receiving yardage for the second straight year. The Lions clinched first place on October 6, earning a third straight bye into the Western Final at home, and tied a team record with a 13–5 mark for the season. 50,084 (league-best for 2006) saw BC crush the Roughriders 45–18 in the West final. Looking fully recovered from earlier concussions, Dickenson went 27 for 37 with three touchdowns and no interceptions. Paris Jackson made two circus catches for TDs, Jason Clermont bulled his way to 98 yards on 6 catches, Joe Smith scored twice and ran for 116 yards, McCallum was 5 for 5 in field goals, and the BC defence dominated Saskatchewan all afternoon.

On November 19, the BC Lions captured their first Grey Cup Championship since 2000 by defeating the Montreal Alouettes 25–14 at Canad Inns Stadium in Winnipeg. Dave Dickenson was named the Most Valuable Player of the game, while Paul McCallum was named the Most Valuable Canadian. In the post-game exuberance, the team snapped the Grey Cup off the lower base with the engraved names, but it was repaired the following Monday. The game is also noted for kicker Paul McCallum going 6 for 6 in field goals, making him a perfect 11 for 11 in the postseason. Coach Buono also used all three quarterbacks in the game: Dickenson, Pierce and third-string Jarious Jackson all took snaps.

The record-setting season was capped off with Buono&#x27;s third CFL Coach of the Year Award. The Lions nearly swept the annual player awards, with Brent Johnson, Geroy Simon, Rob Murphy, Mark Washington, and Aaron Hunt (BC&#x27;s sixth Outstanding Rookie in nine years) all taking home hardware.

In 2007 offensive coordinator Jacques Chapdelaine left for the Edmonton Eskimos in the off-season, becoming their offensive coordinator and assistant head coach. The Lions&#x27; play-calling duties for the 2007 season were handled by quarterbacks coach Steff Kruck, with play design by offensive line coach Dan Dorazio. Veteran linebacker Carl Kidd announced his retirement at the Grey Cup ring ceremony held just prior to training camp, while Bobby Singh was cut and soon picked up by the Calgary Stampeders. John Hufnagel guest-coached at training camp, having previously worked under Buono as offensive coordinator in Calgary in the 1990s.

2007 proved to be one of the best seasons for the Lions, having set a new franchise record for the most regular-season wins in club history. The season started off on a 5-game winning streak, including dominating wins over Edmonton (29–9) and Saskatchewan (42–12). However, the streak came to a halt on August 3, 2007, when the Leos suffered a 21–9 loss to the Saskatchewan Roughriders. The Lions had a little trouble getting back on track, as they suffered a loss to Winnipeg and a tie with Calgary. A 40–7 win over Toronto moved the Lions back into 1st place in the West Division, due to a Saskatchewan loss to Calgary. On September 22, 2007, the Lions battled their biggest foe, the Saskatchewan Roughriders, for the 1st place spot in the West Division. The Saskatchewan lead increased and decreased several times throughout the game. However, with Saskatchewan leading by 4, the Lions never gave up in the dying minutes of the game, and QB Jarious Jackson was able to find Geroy Simon in the endzone and pass the ball for a game-winning 33 yard touchdown. The final result was an unexpected come-from-behind 37–34 victory for the Lions. The Lions went on to win all the rest of their games of the regular season and captured 1st place in the West Division for a fourth consecutive year. The Lions also finished with a regular-season record of 14–3–1, The best in club history. The Lions felt confident heading into the Western Final, but their dreams of second consecutive Grey Cup title came to an end in a heartbreaking 26–17 loss to the eventual Grey Cup champions, the Saskatchewan Roughriders.

Just before the 2008 season, the Lions&#x27; Josh Boden was cut due to being arrested. Also, Mark Washington became the secondary coach due to salary cap issues. Quarterback star Dave Dickenson was released in the final year of his contract of $400k/yr and was picked up by the Calgary Stampeders. Jacques Chapdelaine came back from the Edmonton Eskimos after being fired as offensive coordinator and assistant head coach in his one year with the club. Defensive coordinator Dave Ritchie retired after the 2007 season and Mike Benevides was promoted to his position. As well, director of player personnel Bob O&#x27;Billovich left to become general manager of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and former Saskatchewan Roughriders general manager Roy Shivers filled his position.

The season started off on low notes, both on and off the field. After losing their first two games to Calgary and Saskatchewan, the BC Lions and the entire CFL community was shocked to hear that Lions president and CEO Bobby Ackles had suffered a heart attack and died on July 6, 2008. The Lions held a memorial ceremony at the next home game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and wore an orange paw on their helmets with &quot;Bob&quot; on the inside to commemorate Ackles.

In their first game of the season, against Calgary, starter Buck Pierce left the game with injury, meaning Jarious Jackson took over as starter. After losing their next game to the Roughriders, the Lions won three straight, synonymous with Stefan Logan&#x27;s debut with the Lions and Joe Smith sitting these games out. On July 25, Geroy Simon surpassed Jim &quot;Dirty 30&quot; Young as the Lions&#x27; all-time receiving yards leader, in a game against the Montreal Alouettes. After electing not to attend Bob Ackles&#x27; memorial, Joe Smith began to estrange himself from the organization and only played in four of the first nine games of the season. While also posting unimpressive numbers, the Lions saw fit to trade their former star running back to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for their former star running back, Charles Roberts on Sept 1, 2009. Shortly after, Roberts reached the 10,000 rushing yard mark for his career on Sept 13, 2009, against the Saskatchewan Roughriders in his first game as a Lion.

After a Labour Day loss to the Montreal Alouettes, the Lions won five straight under a healthy Buck Pierce. Since Buono had become head coach in 2003, the Lions had won at least four in a row each year, a streak that ended in 2009. The Lions finished the regular season with an 11–7 record, including a loss at Calgary in the last regular-season game. After going 3–0–1 against Calgary in the previous season, the Lions were swept by Calgary for the first time since the 2000 season. After amassing 23 sacks, Cameron Wake won the Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award for the second consecutive year. In the playoffs, the Lions defeated the Saskatchewan Roughriders at Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field 33–12, but lost, yet again, to the Calgary Stampeders, this time in the Western final.

The 2009 season saw a team that was decidedly different from the previous seasons&#x27; roster. While the coaching staff remained completely intact, the playing roster saw a number of notable players released or traded and some leaving for the NFL. Outstanding Defensive Player Cameron Wake signed with the Miami Dolphins, Team Rookie of the Year, Stefan Logan, signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rob Murphy signed with the Toronto Argonauts and Jason Clermont and Charles Roberts were released. Otis Floyd and Tyrone Williams were later released and Jason Pottinger was traded to the Argonauts. They signed all-star linebacker Anton McKenzie, while trying to fill holes in their roster with their depth players from last year and new recruits from the US.

The season was notable for the team&#x27;s use of five different quarterbacks – Buck Pierce started the year but gave way after injury to Jarious Jackson. When Jackson was injured, 3rd string QB Travis Lulay was pressed into action. Former Lion and league MVP Casey Printers then signed to the practice roster on October 8, and suited up as the third-string QB on October 9 in a game versus the Edmonton Eskimos. He then became the starting quarterback on October 24, in a 33–30 overtime loss to the Saskatchewan Roughriders. In the season finale on November 6 against Edmonton, Printers was knocked out of the game with a broken thumb. In the last regular-season game 5th string quarterback Zac Champion played more than two quarters when Buck Pierce also went down.

Losing to each of the other 3 Western teams in successive games meant BC finished fourth and last. However, Hamilton defeated Winnipeg in their last game of the season, enabling the Lions to cross over to the Eastern Division&#x27;s play-off format (ahead of both Winnipeg and Toronto). The Lions faced the Tiger-Cats in the Eastern semi-final in Hamilton on November 15 and won in overtime. The Lions then advanced the Eastern final against the Montreal Alouettes, but lost 56–18.
The 2009–10 offseason saw the club lose even more veterans, many who were cut by Buono, and others who left for the NFL. Quarterback Buck Pierce was released on March 9, 2010 after the return of Casey Printers meant that the injury-prone Pierce was expendable. The Lions also released former Special Teams Player of the Year Ian Smart, linebacker Javier Glatt and defensive back Lavar Glover, each of whom played a major role in the Lions&#x27; 2006 Grey Cup win. The team also lost Rolly Lumbala and Ryan Grice-Mullen to the NFL&#x27;s Miami Dolphins, while rookie phenom Martell Mallett signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite this, the club signed a number of proven CFL players, including Davis Sanchez and Keron Williams from the Montreal Alouettes, Jamal Robertson from the Toronto Argonauts and exiled former Bomber Derick Armstrong.

The 2010 BC Lions played all of their home games at their former site at the Pacific National Exhibition grounds at Empire Field while BC Place Stadium had a retractable roof installed. The Lions also staged their training camp in Kamloops, BC – the first of three over the next three years – as a part of the club&#x27;s desire to represent the entire province.

The season started out well for the Lions, with a win against Edmonton, but that success was short lived as the Lions lost their next seven consecutive games. Quarterback Casey Printers suffered a knee injury in game 3 against the Montreal Alouettes, which forced backup quarterback Travis Lulay to start the next three games. After losing to Toronto and the previously winless Eskimos, Lulay was replaced by Jarious Jackson in the fourth quarter in the August 7, 2010, contest against Calgary after demonstrating poor play and inexperience.

After the bye week, Printers returned and won three out of the five games he started, but due to his turnover-filled back-to-back performances, he was replaced with Lulay as the starter in game 13 against Winnipeg, which the Lions won. After Lulay had a minor injury in the following game, again against Winnipeg, Printers came into the game to protect a 21-point lead. The Blue Bombers stormed back to tie the game and force overtime, which was decided by Printers&#x27; game-clinching interception. It was Casey&#x27;s last game with the Lions as Buono released him soon after the game. Consequently, Lulay became the starting quarterback, finishing the season 4–5 as a starter. The Lions won their last three games to qualify for the playoffs after Edmonton lost their final game of the season, but lost in double overtime to the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the West semi-final game.

====2011 Grey Cup champions====

The 2011 BC Lions season was perhaps one of the greatest season turnarounds in CFL history. The Lions entered the 2011 campaign with a lot of question marks. The team had almost exactly the same coaching staff as they had the year before, which had been criticized by many fans the past season. The team also lost a few key players, most notably Emmanuel Arceneaux to the NFL. As well, the team opted to go with inexperienced third-year QB Travis Lulay at quarterback.
Despite a questionable lineup, the Lions, as well as many fans and critics alike, believed that the team was good enough to win the Grey Cup, especially since the game was scheduled to be played in Vancouver at the newly renovated BC Place Stadium. However, the season started out with five straight losses which forced changes to be made. The Lions signed two notable CFL players; defensive back Tad Kornegay, who had just been released by Saskatchewan, and wide receiver Arland Bruce, who was acquired in a trade with Hamilton. The Lions got their first win of the season when they beat the Saskatchewan Roughriders 24–11 in week 6, but the following week, the Lions were swept by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for the first time in ten years. Now sitting at 1–6, many fans and critics started to doubt the Lions playoff hopes, but after a convincing 36–1 win over the Edmonton Eskimos, the Lions went on a remarkable 8-game winning streak, skyrocketing the Leos all the way to the top of a very competitive West Division. The Lions winning streak ended after a 42–10 loss to Hamilton in week 17, but after that, the Lions won their last two games of the season, which included a 43–1 clobbering of the two-time defending Grey Cup champions Montreal Alouettes in the regular-season finale. After starting the season 0–5, the Lions rebounded to win 11 of their last 13 games to clinch 1st place in the West Division with an 11–7 record, as well as a bye in the first round of the playoffs and a home playoff game.

In the West Division Final, the Lions faced the Edmonton Eskimos, the same team that beat the Lions in the 2005 West final, which denied the Lions a home game in the Grey Cup, since Vancouver hosted the Grey Cup that year. However, in 2011, a home game in the Grey Cup is what the Lions got, as the Leos dominated the Eskimos 40–23 as the Lions advanced to the big game for the first time in five years. In the Grey Cup, the Lions were up against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for only the second time in Grey Cup history. Although Winnipeg won both regular-season meetings with BC, the Lions went on to beat the Bombers 34–23 in front of a home crowd to win their 6th Grey Cup championship in franchise history. Travis Lulay was named Grey Cup Most Valuable Player, while Winnipeg native Andrew Harris was named Most Valuable Canadian. With the Grey Cup win, the BC Lions became the first team to start a season 0–5 and win the Grey Cup.

Head coach Wally Buono announced shortly after the Grey Cup that he would step down as head coach but would remain as vice president and general manager. The BC Lions were named The Canadian Press Team of the Year for 2011 in voting by sports editors and broadcasters across Canada.

===Missed opportunities and near-misses (2012–2019)===
Defensive coordinator Mike Benevides was promoted and announced as the team&#x27;s new head coach on December 13, 2011.
Several veteran players left the team or were released prior to the start of the 2012 season. Defensive back Tad Kornegay was released by the Lions while all-star linebacker Solomon Elimimian and defensive tackle Aaron Hunt signed with the Minnesota Vikings and the Montreal Alouettes, respectively. The Lions did, however, manage to resign veteran cornerbacks Dante Marsh and Ryan Phillips during the free-agency period, as well as all-star defensive back Lin-J Shell and cornerback Byron Parker.

On December 19, 2014, Jeff Tedford was named the 25th head coach in franchise history after Mike Benevides had been let go November 20. The 2015 season saw the emergence of rookie quarterback Jonathan Jennings, who took over as the starter from Travis Lulay midway through the season. The 2015 season was the only one for Tedford, as he resigned after only one season where he led the lions to a 7–11 record, finishing third in the west and losing to Calgary in the playoffs. Upon Tedford&#x27;s resignation, Wally Buono announced that he would return as head coach in 2016.

In Buono&#x27;s first season back at the helm of the Lions, he guided the team to its first second-place finish in the West since 1986, with a 12–6 record, and defeated the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West Semi-Final, only to lose to Calgary in the West Final. The following season, the Lions missed the playoffs for the first time since 1996, finishing in 5th and last place in the West with a 7–11 record. On November 30, 2017, Buono stepped down from his position as general manager, being replaced in that stead by Ed Hervey. Buono stayed on as head coach in 2018, but he also announced it would be his last season as coach for the team. The team finished 9–9, returning to the playoffs as a crossover team, losing to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the East Semi-Final 48–8. On December 18, 2018, DeVone Claybrooks was named Buono&#x27;s successor at head coach for the Lions. He lasted only one season, finishing in 5th and last place in the West with a 5–13 mark, with Claybrooks fired on November 5. Former Ottawa Redblacks coach Rick Campbell was named the new head coach of the Lions on December 2, 2019.

===A new era, a new owner (2020–present)===
In October 2020, owner David Braley died, but bequeathed funds for the BC Lions so that the team could continue to operate for several seasons. On August 18, 2021, the BC Lions were bought by Amar Doman, who runs two private companies in British Columbia, Futura Corporation and CanWel. After the cancellation of the 2020 CFL season, the Lions returned to play along with the rest of the CFL in 2021. However, the team languished in the shortened season, with a seven-game losing streak in the second half proving fatal to the team&#x27;s season, and they finished 5–9, good for fourth in the West. 2022 saw the Lions return to the playoffs for the first time since 2018, guided by new quarterback Nathan Rourke, who led the team to a 12–6 and second place in the West. The Lions downed the Calgary Stampeders in the West Semi-Final, but their season ended at the hands of the two-time defending Grey Cup champion Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West Final game. The 2023 season saw a similar finish, a 12–6 second-place finish in the West, defeating the Stampeders in the West Semi Final game, but losing again to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West Final game. 

2024 marked the BC Lions 70th season and saw the club host several large events, including a sellout home opener featuring a pregame performance by global rap icon 50 Cent. On August 31, the Lions played the first Touchdown Pacific, defeating the Ottawa Redblacks 38–12 at Royal Athletic Park in Victoria. Based on the CFL&#x27;s Touchdown Atlantic series, Touchdown Pacific was the first regular season CFL game played on Vancouver Island. Royal Athletic Park, which is the home of the Victoria Harbourcats collegiate baseball team, increased its capacity from 3,500 to over 14,000. The BC Lions also hosted the 111th Grey Cup game at BC Place on November 17.

<doc id="240335" wikidata="Q625923" url="?curid=240335" title="The Turn of the Screw">
<text>The Turn of the Screw is an 1898 gothic horror novella by Henry James which first appeared in serial format in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from January 27 to April 16, 1898. On October 7, 1898, it was collected in &quot;The Two Magics&quot;, published by Macmillan in New York City and Heinemann in London. The novella follows a governess who, caring for two children at a remote country house, becomes convinced that they are haunted. &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; is considered a work of both Gothic and horror fiction.

In the century following its publication, critical analysis of the novella underwent several major transformations. Initial reviews regarded it only as a frightening ghost story, but, in the 1930s, some critics suggested that the supernatural elements were figments of the governess&#x27; imagination. In the early 1970s, the influence of structuralism resulted in an acknowledgement that the text&#x27;s ambiguity was its key feature. Later approaches incorporated Marxist and feminist thinking, though the validity of these later approaches is disputed. 

The novella has been adapted several times, including a Broadway play (1950), a chamber opera (1954), two films (in 1961 and 2020), and a miniseries (2020).

== Plot ==
On Christmas Eve, an unnamed narrator and some of his friends are gathered around a fire. One of them, Douglas, reads a manuscript written by his sister&#x27;s late governess. The manuscript tells the story of her being hired by a man who has become responsible for his young niece and nephew following the deaths of their parents. He lives mainly in London and has a country house in Bly, Essex.

The boy, Miles, is attending a boarding school, while his younger sister, Flora, is living in Bly, where she is cared for by Mrs. Grose, the housekeeper. Flora&#x27;s uncle, the governess&#x27;s new employer, is uninterested in raising the children and gives her full charge, explicitly stating that she is not to bother him with communications of any sort. The governess travels to Bly and begins her duties.

Miles returns from school for the summer just after a letter arrives from the headmaster, informing his caretakers that he has been expelled. Miles never speaks of the matter, and the governess is hesitant to raise the issue. She fears there is some horrible secret behind the expulsion, but is too charmed by the boy to want to press the issue.

Soon after, around the grounds of the estate, the governess begins to see the figures of a man and woman whom she does not recognize. The figures come and go at will without being seen or challenged by other members of the household, and they seem to the governess to be supernatural. She learns from Mrs. Grose that the governess&#x27;s predecessor, Miss Jessel, and another employee, Peter Quint, had had a close relationship. Before their deaths, Jessel and Quint spent much of their time with Flora and Miles, and the governess becomes convinced that the two children are aware of the ghosts&#x27; presence and influenced by them.

Without permission, Flora leaves the house while Miles is playing music for the governess. The governess notices Flora&#x27;s absence and goes with Mrs. Grose in search of her. They find her on the shore of a nearby lake, and the governess is convinced that Flora has been talking to the ghost of Miss Jessel. The governess sees Miss Jessel and believes Flora sees her as well, but Mrs. Grose does not. Flora denies seeing Miss Jessel and begins to insist that she will not see the new governess again.

The governess decides that Mrs. Grose should take Flora away to her uncle in attempt to escape Miss Jessel&#x27;s influence. Left alone with the governess, Miles at last confesses he was expelled for something he said but cannot remember what he said or to whom he said it. The ghost of Quint appears to the governess at the window. The governess shields Miles, who attempts to see the ghost. The governess insists to Miles he is no longer controlled by the ghost, only to find that Miles has died in her arms.

== Genre ==
=== Gothic fiction ===
As a piece of Gothic fiction, critics highlight the influence of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847) on the novella. &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; borrows both from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;&#x27;s themes of class and gender, and from its mid-nineteenth-century setting. The novella alludes to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; in tandem with an explicit reference to Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s Gothic novel &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; (1794), wherein the governess wonders if there might be a secret relative hidden in the attic at Bly. One critic writes that the only &quot;definite event&quot; in the novel that does not &quot;belong&quot; in Gothic fantasy is Miles&#x27; expulsion from school.

Although the influence of the Gothic on the novella is clear, it cannot only be characterised as one. James&#x27; ghosts differ from those of traditional Gothic tales – frightening, often bound in chains – by appearing like their living selves. Similarly, the novella foregoes major devices associated with Gothic novels, such as digressions, as in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818) and &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897), instead relating one whole, continuous narrative.

=== Ghost story and horror fiction ===
For the story&#x27;s publication in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, James was contracted to write a ghost story. As a result, some critics have regarded it in that tradition. L. Andrew Cooper observed that &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; might be the best-known example of a ghost story which exploits the ambiguity of a first-person narrative. Citing James&#x27; reference to the work as his &quot;designed horror&quot;, Donald P. Costello suggested that the effect of a given scene varies depending on who represents the action. In scenes where the governess directly reports on what she sees, the effect is horror, but in those where she merely comments, the effect is &quot;mystification&quot;. In his 1983 nonfiction survey of the horror genre, author Stephen King described &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; and &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; (1959) as the only two great supernatural works of horror in a century. He argued that both contain &quot;secrets best left untold and things left best unsaid&quot;, calling that the basis of the horror genre. Gillian Flynn called the novella one of the most chilling ghost stories ever written.

Several biographers have indicated that James was familiar with spiritualism, and at the very least regarded it as entertainment. His brother William was an active researcher of supernatural phenomena. Scientific inquiry at the time was curious about the existence of ghosts, and James&#x27; description of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel—dressed in black with severe expressions—resemble the ghosts found in scientific literature rather than those of fictional narratives. The character of Douglas describes himself as a student of Trinity College, where James knew research into the supernatural occurred. It is unknown whether James believed in ghosts.

== Background ==
=== Biographical context and composition ===
By the 1890s, James&#x27; readership had dwindled since the success of &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; (1878), and he had encountered financial troubles. His health had also worsened, with advancing gout, and several of his close friends had died: his sister and diarist Alice James, and writers Robert Louis Stevenson and Constance Fenimore Woolson. In a letter from October 1895, James wrote: &quot;I see ghosts everywhere&quot;. In an entry in his journal from January 12, 1895, James recounts a ghost story told to him by Edward White Benson, the archbishop of Canterbury, while visiting him for tea at his home two days earlier. The story bears a striking resemblance to what would eventually become &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, with depraved servants corrupting young children before and after their deaths.

Towards the end of 1897, James was contracted to write a twelve-part ghost story for &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, an illustrated magazine. Having just signed a twenty-one year lease on a house in Rye, East Sussex, James —thankful for the additional income—accepted the offer. &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; paid James US$900 () for the serial rights. A year earlier, in 1897, &quot;The Chap-Book&quot; paid him US$150 () for serial and book rights to &quot;What Maisie Knew&quot;.

James found it difficult to write by hand, reserving that for his journals. &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; was dictated to his secretary, William MacAlpine, who took shorthand notes and returned with typed notes the following day. Finding such a delay frustrating, James purchased his own Remington typewriter and dictated directly to MacAlpine. In December 1897, James wrote to his sister-in-law: &quot;I &quot;have&quot;, at last, finished my little book.&quot;

=== Publication and later revisions ===
&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; was first published in the magazine &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, serialised in 12 installments (27 January – 16 April 1898). The title illustration by John La Farge depicts the governess with her arm around Miles. Episode illustrations were by Eric Pape.

In October 1898, the novella appeared with the short story &quot;Covering End&quot; in a volume titled &quot;The Two Magics&quot;, published by Macmillan in New York City and by Heinemann in London.

Ten years after publication, James revised &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; for the &quot;New York Edition&quot; of the text. James made many changes, but most were minor, such as changing &quot;utter&quot; to &quot;express&quot;; the narrative was unchanged. The &quot;New York Edition&quot;″s most important contribution was the retrospective account of the influences and writing of the novella James gave in his preface. James indicated, for example, that he was aware of research into the supernatural. In his preface, James only briefly mentions the story&#x27;s origin in a magazine. In 2016, Kirsten MacLeod, citing James&#x27; private correspondence, indicated that he had a strong dislike for the serial form.

== Reception ==
=== Early criticism ===
Early reviews emphasised the novella&#x27;s power to frighten, and most saw the tale as a brilliant, if simple, ghost story. According to scholar Terry Heller, most early reviewers saw the novel as a formidable piece of Gothic fiction.

An early review of &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; was in &quot;The New York Times Saturday Review of Books and Art&quot;, stating it was worthy of being compared to Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886). The reviewer noted it as a successful study of evil, referring to the ghosts&#x27; influence over the children and the governess. Scholar Terry Heller notes that the children featured prominently in early criticism because the novella violated a Victorian presumption of childhood innocence.

Conceptions of the text wherein the ghosts are real entities are often referred to as the &quot;apparitionist interpretation&quot;; consequently, a &quot;non-apparitionist&quot; holds the opposite perspective. In a 1918 essay, Virginia Woolf wrote that Miss Jessel and Peter Quint possessed &quot;neither the substance nor independent existence of ghosts&quot;. Woolf did not suggest that the ghosts were hallucinations, but—in a similar fashion to other early critics—said they represented the governess&#x27; growing awareness of evil in the world. The power of the story, she argued, was in forcing readers to realise the dark places fiction could take their minds.

=== Psychoanalytic interpretations ===
In 1934, literary critic Edmund Wilson posited that the ghosts were hallucinations of the governess, who he suggested was sexually repressed. As evidence, Wilson points to her background as the daughter of a country parson, and suggests that she is infatuated with her employer. Before Wilson&#x27;s article, another critic—Edna Kenton—had written to similar effect, but Wilson&#x27;s fame as a literary critic shifted the discourse around the novella completely. Wilson drew heavily from Kenton&#x27;s writing, but applied explicitly Freudian terminology. For example, he pointed to Quint first being sighted by the governess on a phallic tower. A book-length close reading of the text was produced in 1965 using Wilson&#x27;s Freudian analysis as a foundation; it characterised the governess as increasingly mad and hysterical. Leon Edel, James&#x27; most influential biographer, wrote that it is not the ghosts who haunt the children, but the governess.

While many supported Wilson&#x27;s theory, it was by no means authoritative. Robert B. Heilman was a prominent advocate for the apparitionist interpretation; he saw the story as a Hawthornesque allegory about good and evil, and the ghosts as active agents to that effect. Scholars critical of Wilson&#x27;s essay pointed to Douglas&#x27; positive account of the governess&#x27;s character in the prologue, long after her death. Most crucially, they indicated that the governess&#x27;s description of the ghost enabled Mrs Grose to identify him as Peter Quint before the governess knew he existed. The second point led Wilson to &quot;retract his thesis (temporarily)&quot;; in a later revision of his essay, he argued the governess had been made aware of another male at Bly by Mrs Grose.

=== Structuralism ===

In the 1970s, critics began to apply structuralist Tzvetan Todorov&#x27;s notion of the fantastic to &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;. Todorov emphasised the importance of &quot;hesitation&quot; in stories with supernatural elements, and critics found an abundance of them within James&#x27; novella. For example, the reader&#x27;s sympathy may hesitate between the children or the governess, and the text hesitates between supporting the ghosts&#x27; existence, and rejecting them. Christine Brooke-Rose argued in a three-part essay that the ambiguity so frequently argued over was a foundational part of the text that had been ignored. From the 1980s onwards, critics increasingly refused to ask questions about diegetic elements of the text, instead acknowledging that many elements simply cannot be known definitively.

Focus shifted away from whether the ghosts were real and onto how James generated and then sustained the text&#x27;s ambiguity. A study into revisions James made to two paragraphs in the novella concluded that James was not striving for clarity, but to create a text which could not be interpreted definitively in either direction.

This is still a position held by many critics, such as , who argues that evidence for the intended ambiguity of the text can be found at the beginning of the novella, where Douglas tells his fictional audience that the governess had never told anyone but himself about the events that happened at Bly, and that they &quot;would easily judge&quot; why. Bottiroli believes that this address to Douglas&#x27; fictional audience is also meant as an address to the reader, telling them that they will &quot;easily judge&quot; whether or not the ghosts are real.

=== Marxist and feminist approaches ===
After the debate over the reality of the ghosts quieted in literary criticism, critics began to apply other theoretical frameworks to &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;. Marxist critics argued that the emphasis placed by academics on James&#x27; language distracted from class-based explorations of the text. The children&#x27;s uncle, who featured largely only in the psychoanalytic interpretations as an obsession of the governess, was regarded by some as symbolising a selfish upper-class. Heath Moon notes how he abandoned his orphaned niece, nephew, and their ancestral home to instead live in London as a bachelor. Mrs Grose&#x27;s distaste for the relationship between Quint and Miss Jessel was noted to be part of a Victorian dislike for relationships that were between different social classes. The death of Miles and Flora&#x27;s parents in India became a fixture of postcolonial explorations of the text, given the status of India as a British colony during James&#x27; lifetime.

Explorations of the governess have become a mainstay of feminist writing on the text. Priscilla Walton noted that James&#x27; account of the story&#x27;s origin disparaged the ability of women to tell stories, and framed &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; as James thus telling it on their behalf. Others see James in a more positive light. Paula Marantz Cohen positively compares James&#x27; treatment of the governess to Sigmund Freud&#x27;s writing about a young woman named Dora. Cohen likens the way that Freud transforms Dora into merely a summary of her symptoms to how critics such as Edmund Wilson reduced the governess to a case of neurotic sexual repression.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; has been the subject of a range of adaptations and reworkings in a variety of media. Many of these have, themselves, been analysed in the academic literature on Henry James and neo-Victorian culture.

===Stage===
The novella was adapted to an opera by Benjamin Britten, which premiered in 1954, and the opera has been filmed on multiple occasions. The novella was adapted as a ballet score (1980) by Luigi Zaninelli, and separately as a ballet (1999) by Will Tucket for the Royal Ballet. Harold Pinter directed &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1950), a Broadway play which was an adaptation of &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;. An adaptation by Jeffrey Hatcher, using the title &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, premiered in Portland, Maine, in 1996 and was produced off-Broadway in 1999. Another adaptation of the same title by Rebecca Lenkiewicz was presented in a co-production with Hammer at the Almeida Theatre, London, in January 2013.

===Films===
There have been numerous film adaptations of the novel. The critically acclaimed &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1961), directed by Jack Clayton, and Michael Winner&#x27;s prequel &quot;The Nightcomers&quot; (1972) are two notable examples. Other feature film adaptations include Rusty Lemorande&#x27;s 1992 eponymous adaptation (set in the 1960s); &#x27;s Spanish language (&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, 1985); &quot;Presence of Mind&quot; (1999), directed by Atoni Aloy; and &quot;In a Dark Place&quot; (2006), directed by Donato Rotunno. &quot;The Others&quot; (2001) is not an adaptation but has some themes in common with James&#x27;s novella. In 2018, director Floria Sigismondi filmed an adaptation of the novella, titled &quot;The Turning&quot;, on the Kilruddery Estate in Ireland.

Television films have included a 1959 American adaptation as part of &quot;Ford Startime&quot; directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Ingrid Bergman; the West German &quot;Die sündigen Engel&quot; (&quot;The Sinful Angel&quot;, 1962), a 1974 adaptation directed by Dan Curtis, adapted by William F. Nolan; a French adaptation entitled &quot;Le Tour d&#x27;écrou&quot; (&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, 1974); a 1982 adaptation directed by Petr Weigl primarily starring Czech actors lip-synching; a 1990 adaptation directed by Graeme Clifford; &quot;The Haunting of Helen Walker&quot; (1995), directed by Tom McLoughlin; a 1999 adaptation directed by Ben Bolt; a low-budget 2003 version written and directed by Nick Millard; the Italian-language &quot;Il mistero del lago&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of the Lake&quot;, 2009); and a 2009 BBC film adapted by Sandy Welch, starring Michelle Dockery, Dan Stevens and Sue Johnston. A Brazilian movie named &quot;&quot; (&quot;Through the Shadow&quot;, 2015) was released, heavily influenced by the book, only changing the characters&#x27; names and location to make it feel like it is set in Brazil.

===Literature===
Literary references to and influences by &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; identified by the James scholar Adeline R. Tintner include &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1911), by Frances Hodgson Burnett; &quot;Poor Girl&quot; (1951), by Elizabeth Taylor; &quot;The Peacock Spring&quot; (1975), by Rumer Godden; &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1975) by Peter Straub; &quot;The Accursed Inhabitants of House Bly&quot; (1994) by Joyce Carol Oates; and &quot;Miles and Flora&quot; (1997)—a sequel—by Hilary Bailey. Further literary adaptations identified by other authors include &quot;Affinity&quot; (1999), by Sarah Waters; &quot;A Jealous Ghost&quot; (2005), by A. N. Wilson; &quot;Florence &amp; Giles&quot; (2010), by John Harding; and &quot;Maybe This Time&quot; (2010) by Jennifer Crusie. Young adult novels inspired by &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; include &quot;The Turning&quot; (2012) by Francine Prose and &quot;Tighter&quot; (2011) by Adele Griffin. Ruth Ware&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;The Turn of the Key&quot; sets the story in the 21st century.

===Television===
&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; has also influenced television. In December 1968, the ABC daytime drama &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; featured a storyline based on &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;. In the story, the ghosts of Quentin Collins and Beth Chavez haunted the west wing of Collinwood, possessing the two children living in the mansion. The story led to a year-long story in the year 1897, as Barnabas Collins travelled back in time to prevent Quentin&#x27;s death and stop the possession. In early episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;Learning Curve&quot; and &quot;Persistence of Vision&quot;), Captain Kathryn Janeway is seen on the holodeck acting out scenes from the holonovel &quot;Janeway Lambda one&quot;, which appears to be based on &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;. The novel was adapted as a Mexican miniseries entitled &quot;Otra vuelta de tuerca&quot; (&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;) in 1981, and in 2020, Netflix adapted the novella as &quot;The Haunting of Bly Manor&quot; for the second season of Mike Flanagan&#x27;s &quot;The Haunting&quot; anthology series.

<doc id="240336" wikidata="Q183255" url="?curid=240336" title="Common warthog">
<text>The common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family (Suidae) found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of &quot;P. aethiopicus&quot;, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.

==Subspecies==
==Description==
The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from , and shoulder height from . Females, at , are smaller and lighter than males, at . A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to long and have a wide elliptical cross section, being about deep and wide. A tusk will curve 90° or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table, as it curves somewhat backwards as it grows. The tusks are not used for digging, but are used for combat with other hogs and in defense against predators – the lower set can inflict severe wounds.

Common warthog ivory is taken from the constantly growing canine teeth. The tusks, particularly the upper set, work in much the same way as elephant tusks with all designs scaled down. Tusks are carved predominantly for the tourist trade in eastern and southern Africa.

The head of the common warthog is large, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back. Sparse hair covers the body. Its color is usually black or brown. Tails are long and end with a tuft of hair. Common warthogs do not have subcutaneous fat and the coat is sparse, making them susceptible to extreme environmental temperatures.

==Ecology==
The common warthog is the only pig species that has adapted to grazing and savanna habitats. Its diet is omnivorous, composed of grasses, roots, berries and other fruits, bark, fungi, insects, eggs and carrion. The diet is seasonably variable, depending on availability of different food items. During the wet seasons, warthogs graze on short perennial grasses. During the dry seasons, they subsist on bulbs, rhizomes, and nutritious roots. 

Warthogs are powerful diggers, using both their snouts and feet. When feeding, they often bend their front feet backwards and move around on the wrists. Calloused pads that protect the wrists during such movement form early in the development of the fetus. Although they can dig their own burrows, they often occupy abandoned burrows of aardvarks and other animals. The common warthog commonly reverses into burrows, with its head facing the opening and ready to burst out if necessary. Common warthogs will wallow in mud to cope with high temperatures and huddle together to cope with low temperatures.

Although capable of fighting (males fight each other during mating season), the common warthog&#x27;s primary defense is to flee by means of fast sprinting. When threatened, warthogs can run at speeds of up to , they will run with their tails sticking up and will enter their dens rear first with tusks facing out. The common warthog&#x27;s main predators are humans, lions, leopards, cheetahs, crocodiles, wild dogs and hyenas. Jackals, Verreaux&#x27;s eagle owls and martial eagles sometimes prey on piglets. However, a female common warthog will defend her piglets aggressively. On occasion, common warthogs have been observed charging and even wounding large predators. Common warthogs have also been observed allowing banded mongooses and vervet monkeys to groom them to remove ticks.

==Social behavior and reproduction==

Common warthogs are not territorial, but instead occupy a home range. Common warthogs live in groups called sounders. Females live in sounders with their young and with other females. Females tend to stay in their natal groups, while males leave, but stay within the home range. Subadult males associate in bachelor groups, but males live alone when they become adults. Adult males only join sounders with estrous females. Warthogs have two facial glands: the tusk gland and the sebaceous gland. Common warthogs of both sexes begin to mark around six to seven months old. Males tend to mark more than females. They mark sleeping and feeding areas and waterholes. Common warthogs use tusk marking for courtship, for antagonistic behaviors, and to establish status.

Common warthogs are seasonal breeders. Rutting begins in the late rainy or early dry season and birthing begins near the start of the following rainy season. The mating system is described as &quot;overlap promiscuity&quot;: the males have ranges overlapping several female ranges, and the daily behavior of the female is unpredictable. Boars employ two mating strategies during the rut. With the &quot;staying tactic&quot;, a boar will stay and defend certain females or a resource valuable to them. In the &quot;roaming tactic&quot;, boars seek out estrous sows and compete for them. Boars will wait for sows to emerge from their burrows. A dominant boar will displace any other boar that also tries to court his female. When a sow leaves her den, the boar will try to demonstrate his dominance and then follow her before copulation. For the &quot;staying tactic&quot;, monogamy, female-defense polygyny, or resource-defense polygyny is promoted, while the &quot;roaming tactic&quot; promotes scramble-competition polygyny.

The typical gestation period is five to six months. When they are about to give birth, sows temporarily leave their families to farrow in a separate hole. The litter is two to eight piglets, with two to four typical. The sow will stay in the burrow for several weeks, nursing her piglets. Common warthog sows have been observed to nurse foster piglets if they lose their own litter. This behavior, known as allosucking, makes them cooperative breeders. Allosucking does not seem to be a case of mistaken identity or milk theft, and may be a sign of kin altruism. Piglets begin grazing at about two to three weeks and are weaned by six months. Piglets quickly attain mobility and stay close to their mothers for defense. Common warthogs live for an average of 7 to 11 years in the wild. Captive specimens on the other hand can live for an average of 21 years. 

==Conservation status==
As of 1999, the common warthog population in southern Africa was estimated to be about 250,000. Typical densities range between in protected areas, but local densities of were found on short grass in Nakuru National Park in Kenya. The species is susceptible to drought and hunting (especially with dogs), which may result in localized extinctions. The common warthog is present in numerous protected areas across its extensive range.

==As an invasive species==
In 2020, it was noted that a population of warthogs, descendants of escaped individuals from game ranches, were running free in southern Texas in the United States.

<text>Lucía Leticia Méndez Pérez (born January 26, 1955) is a Mexican telenovela and film actress, top model and singer. Méndez was born in León, Guanajuato, Mexico.

== Career ==

Her first work in television was in the telenovela “Muchacha italiana viene a casarse” (1972). In 2011, Lucía starred in Mexico the telenovela &quot;Esperanza del Corazón&quot; (&quot;Hoping Heart&quot;), with Fernando Allende and the Mexican Broadway star Bianca Marroquín. Also in 2011, she was inducted into the Paseo de las Luminarias (Plaza of the Stars) for her work as a recording artist and in television.

She has also worked in Televisa&#x27;s telenovelas “Tú o nadie”, “El extraño retorno de Diana Salazar”.

In her youth she had an affair with Luis Miguel the singer.

== Tension with Madonna ==

=== Alleged incident ===
In 2006, Méndez and her then-boyfriend were present at a Madonna concert in Miami, during the singer&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; Tour. The pair were seated in the front row, with Méndez being the only person seated due to an apparent knee injury. When Méndez could not stand up with everyone else, Madonna allegedly began to forcefully gesture at her to stand. Méndez pointed to her knee to show the singer that she could not stand easily. Reportedly, Madonna grew so irate that she asked security guards to tell her that she had to stand up, to which Lucia shouted, &quot;I&#x27;m going to call my lawyer!&quot; Madonna allegedly responded with &quot;Fuck you!&quot; However, this report has not been validated by any parties besides Méndez herself.

This anecdote was a source of ridicule and mockery of Méndez in social networks. It was considered that she was exaggerating and that she had invented the story. The publication on TikTok of a Madonna concert in Los Angeles, in which she showed her displeasure because the spectators in the first rows did not get up to dance, could support the thesis of the Mexican actress.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Illinois Jacquet (October 30, 1922 – July 22, 2004) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist, best remembered for his solo on &quot;Flying Home&quot;, critically recognized as the first R&amp;B saxophone solo. He is also known as one of the writers of the jazz standard &quot;Don&#x27;cha Go &#x27;Way Mad.&quot;

Although he was a pioneer of the honking tenor saxophone that became a regular feature of jazz playing and a hallmark of early rock and roll, Jacquet was a skilled and melodic improviser, both on up-tempo tunes and ballads. He doubled on the bassoon, one of only a few jazz musicians to use the instrument.

==Early life==
Jacquet&#x27;s parents were Creoles of color, named Marguerite Trahan and Gilbert Jacquet, When he was an infant, his family moved from Louisiana to Houston, Texas, and he was raised there as one of six siblings. His father was a part-time bandleader. As a child he performed in his father&#x27;s band, primarily on the alto saxophone. His older brother Russell Jacquet played trumpet and his other brother Linton played drums.

At 15, Jacquet began playing with the Milton Larkin Orchestra, a Houston-area dance band. He attended Wheatley High School. In 1939, he moved to Los Angeles, California, where he met Nat King Cole. Jacquet would sit in with the trio on occasion. In 1940, Cole introduced Jacquet to Lionel Hampton who had returned to California and was putting together a big band. Hampton wanted to hire Jacquet, but asked the young Jacquet to switch to tenor saxophone.

==Career==

In 1942, at age 19, Jacquet soloed on the Hampton Orchestra&#x27;s recording of &quot;Flying Home&quot;, one of the first times a honking tenor sax was heard on record. The record became a hit. The song immediately became the climax for the live shows and Jacquet became exhausted from having to &quot;bring down the house&quot; every night. The solo was built to weave in and out of the arrangement and continued to be played by every saxophone player who followed Jacquet in the band, including Arnett Cobb and Dexter Gordon, who achieved almost as much attention as Jacquet in playing it. It is one of the few jazz solos to have been memorized and played very much the same way by everyone who played the song. He left the Hampton band in 1943 and joined Cab Calloway&#x27;s Orchestra. 

Jacquet appeared with Calloway&#x27;s band in Lena Horne&#x27;s movie &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943). In the earlier years of Jacquet&#x27;s career, his brother Linton Jacquet managed him on the chitlin circuit Linton&#x27;s daughter, Brenda Jacquet-Ross, sang in jazz venues in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1990s to early 2000s, with a band called the Mondo Players.

In 1944, Jacquet returned to California and started a small band with his brother Russell and a young Charles Mingus. It was at this time that he appeared in the Academy Award-nominated short film &quot;Jammin&#x27; the Blues&quot; with Lester Young. He also appeared at the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concert. In 1946, he moved to New York City, and joined the Count Basie orchestra, replacing Lester Young. 

Jacquet wrote the instrumental &quot;Black Velvet&quot; with Jimmy Mundy in 1949 and recorded it the same year. Al Stillman put lyrics to it, and it was recorded later the same year by Harry James as &quot;Don&#x27;cha Go &#x27;Way Mad.&quot; The song has since been performed by dozens of performers, including Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald.

In 1952, Jacquet co-wrote &quot;Just When We&#x27;re Falling in Love&quot; (Jacquet (m), Sir Charles Thompson (m), S. K. &quot;Bob&quot; Russell (l)). Jacquet continued to perform (mostly in Europe) in small groups through the 1960s and 1970s. He led the Illinois Jacquet Big Band from 1981 until his death. 
Jacquet became the first jazz musician to be an artist-in-residence at Harvard University, in 1983. He played &quot;C-Jam Blues&quot; with President Bill Clinton on the White House lawn during Clinton&#x27;s inaugural ball in 1993. Jacquet&#x27;s final performance was on July 16, 2004, at the Lincoln Center in New York.

== Personal life ==
Jacquet was first married to Jacqueline Jacquet.

His marriage to socialite Barbara Jacquet ended in divorce. They had a daughter, Pamela Jacquet Davis.
Jacquet died in the home he shared with his long time partner, Carol Scherick, in Queens, New York, of a heart attack on July 22, 2004. He was 81 years old. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx, New York City.

==Influence==
His solos of the early and mid-1940s and his performances at the Jazz at the Philharmonic concert series, influenced rhythm and blues and rock and roll saxophone style, but also continue to be heard in jazz. His honking and screeching emphasized the lower and higher registers of the tenor saxophone. Despite a superficial rawness, the style is heard in jazz players like Arnett Cobb, who also became known for playing &quot;Flying Home&quot; with Hampton, as well as Sonny Rollins, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis and Jimmy Forrest.

==Activism==
Jacquet pushed back against Jim Crow laws in Houston. After booking his band to play at the Rice Hotel, he protested against management&#x27;s rule that African Americans should enter the premises through an alley door. He issued an ultimatum: either allow his all-black orchestra to access the hotel through the main entrance or he would cancel the engagement. The Rice Hotel agreed to suspend the Jim Crow rule for Jacquet&#x27;s band.

After leaving Houston to tour the United States and several other countries, Jacquet contemplated the manner in which he would return:

Jazz producer Norman Granz, who had been a social activist himself, made arrangements for the star-studded Philharmonic band to play an engagement at Houston&#x27;s Music Hall on October 5, 1955. Jacquet played saxophone, accompanying Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Oscar Peterson, and Buddy Rich. Granz and Jacquet collaborated to eliminate Jim Crow customs from the event. There were no advanced sales of tickets, while Granz removed all of the &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; signs which indicated segregated facilities within the venue and hired some off-duty Houston police officers for security. The band played before a non-segregated audience, though not completely free of trouble. Despite Granz&#x27;s precaution, five officers of the Houston Vice Squad stormed Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s dressing room with firearms drawn. Jacquet and Gillespie were playing dice games, which the Vice Squad used as a pretext for arresting Jacquet, Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and her assistant. This was a performance within a performance, however, as the quartet was whisked to the police station, where there were waiting photographers. After paying their fines, they all returned to the Music Hall where the band played the second set with the audience none the wiser.

==Memorial==

In 2008, The Chapel of the Sisters in Prospect Cemetery was restored and re-dedicated as the Illinois Jacquet Performance Space on the grounds of York College in Jamaica, Queens.

<text>In marketing, market segmentation or customer segmentation is the process of dividing a consumer or business market into meaningful sub-groups of current or potential customers (or consumers) known as &quot;segments&quot;. Its purpose is to identify profitable and growing segments that a company can target with distinct marketing strategies.

In dividing or segmenting markets, researchers typically look for common characteristics such as shared needs, common interests, similar lifestyles, or even similar demographic profiles. The overall aim of segmentation is to identify &quot;high-yield segments&quot; – that is, those segments that are likely to be the most profitable or that have growth potential – so that these can be selected for special attention (i.e. become target markets). Many different ways to segment a market have been identified. Business-to-business (B2B) sellers might segment the market into different types of businesses or countries, while business-to-consumer (B2C) sellers might segment the market into demographic segments, such as lifestyle, behavior, or socioeconomic status.

Market segmentation assumes that different market segments require different marketing programs – that is, different offers, prices, promotions, distribution, or some combination of marketing variables. Market segmentation is not only designed to identify the most profitable segments but also to develop profiles of key segments to better understand their needs and purchase motivations. Insights from segmentation analysis are subsequently used to support marketing strategy development and planning. Many marketers use the &quot;S-T-P approach;&quot; Segmentation → Targeting → [[Market segmentation|P]]ositioning to provide the framework for marketing planning objectives. That is, a market is segmented, one or more segments are selected for targeting, and products or services are positioned in a way that resonates with the selected target market or markets.

== Definition and brief explanation ==

Market segmentation is the process of dividing mass markets into groups with similar needs and wants. The rationale for market segmentation is that in order to achieve competitive advantage and superior performance, firms should: &quot;(1) identify segments of industry demand, (2) target specific segments of demand, and (3) develop specific &#x27;marketing mixes&#x27; for each targeted market segment. &quot; From an economic perspective, segmentation is built on the assumption that heterogeneity in demand allows for demand to be disaggregated into segments with distinct demand functions.

== History ==
The business historian Richard S. Tedlow identifies four stages in the evolution of market segmentation:

* Fragmentation (pre-1880s): The economy was characterized by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis.
* Unification or mass marketing (1880s–1920s): As transportation systems improved, the economy became unified. Standardized, branded goods were distributed at a national level. Manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardization to achieve scale economies to penetrate markets in the early stages of a product&#x27;s lifecycle. e.g. the Model T Ford.
* Segmentation (the 1920s–1980s): As market size increased, manufacturers were able to produce different models pitched at different quality points to meet the needs of various demographic and psychographic market segments. This is the era of market differentiation based on demographic, socio-economic, and lifestyle factors.
* Hyper-segmentation (post-1980s): a shift towards the definition of ever more narrow market segments. Technological advancements, especially in the area of digital communications, allow marketers to communicate with individual consumers or very small groups. This is sometimes known as &quot;one-to-one&quot; marketing.
The practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers thought about it at a theoretical level. Archaeological evidence suggests that Bronze Age traders segmented trade routes according to geographical circuits. Other evidence suggests that the practice of modern market segmentation was developed incrementally from the 16th century onwards. Retailers, operating outside the major metropolitan cities, could not afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively, yet retailers needed to find ways to separate the wealthier clientele from the &quot;riff-raff&quot;. One simple technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue starting in the late sixteenth century, was to invite favored customers into a back room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper&#x27;s private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack. The eighteenth-century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls to which only the upper classes were invited while Wedgewood used a team of itinerant salesmen to sell wares to the masses.

Evidence of early marketing segmentation has also been noted elsewhere in Europe. A study of the German book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the 1820s. From the 1880s, German toy manufacturers were producing models of tin toys for specific geographic markets; London omnibuses and ambulances destined for the British market; French postal delivery vans for Continental Europe and American locomotives intended for sale in America. Such activities suggest that basic forms of market segmentation have been practiced since the 17th century and possibly earlier.

Contemporary market segmentation emerged in the first decades of the twentieth century as marketers responded to two pressing issues. Demographic and purchasing data were available for groups but rarely for individuals and secondly, advertising and distribution channels were available for groups, but rarely for single consumers. Between 1902 and 1910, George B Waldron, working at Mahin&#x27;s Advertising Agency in the United States used tax registers, city directories, and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated vs illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations, etc. in a very early example of simple market segmentation. In 1924 Paul Cherington developed the &#x27;ABCD&#x27; household typology; the first socio-demographic segmentation tool. By the 1930s, market researchers such as Ernest Dichter recognized that demographics alone were insufficient to explain different marketing behaviors and began exploring the use of lifestyles, attitudes, values, beliefs and culture to segment markets. With access to group-level data only, brand marketers approached the task from a tactical viewpoint. Thus, segmentation was essentially a brand-driven process.

Wendell R. Smith is generally credited with being the first to introduce the concept of market segmentation into the marketing literature in 1956 with the publication of his article, &quot;Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies.&quot; Smith&#x27;s article makes it clear that he had observed &quot;many examples of segmentation&quot; emerging and to a certain extent saw this as a &quot;natural force&quot; in the market that would &quot;not be denied.&quot; As Schwarzkopf points out, Smith was codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in advertising and brand management since at least the 1920s.

Until relatively recently, most segmentation approaches have retained a tactical perspective in that they address immediate short-term decisions; such as describing the current “market served” and are concerned with informing marketing mix decisions. However, with the advent of digital communications and mass data storage, it has been possible for marketers to conceive of segmenting at the level of the individual consumer. Extensive data is now available to support segmentation in very narrow groups or even for a single customer, allowing marketers to devise a customized offer with an individual price that can be disseminated via real-time communications. Some scholars have argued that the fragmentation of markets has rendered traditional approaches to market segmentation less useful.

== Criticisms ==

The limitations of conventional segmentation have been well documented in the literature. Perennial criticisms include:

* That it is no better than mass marketing at building brands
* In competitive markets, segments rarely exhibit major differences in the way they use brands
* That it fails to identify sufficiently narrow clusters
* Geographic/demographic segmentation is overly descriptive and lacks sufficient insights into the motivations necessary to drive communications strategy
* Difficulties with market dynamics, notably the instability of segments over time and structural change which leads to segment creep and membership migration as individuals move from one segment to another
* Segments are categories that marketers create for consumers, but consumers do not self-identify with them.

Market segmentation has many critics. Despite its limitations, market segmentation remains one of the enduring concepts in marketing and continues to be widely used in practice. One American study, for example, suggested that almost 60 percent of senior executives had used market segmentation in the past two years.

== Market segmentation strategy ==
A key consideration for marketers is whether they should segment. Depending on company philosophy, resources, product type, or market characteristics, a business may develop an undifferentiated approach or &quot;differentiated approach&quot;. In an undifferentiated approach, the marketer ignores segmentation and develops a product that meets the needs of the largest number of buyers. In a differentiated approach, the firm targets one or more market segments and develops separate offers for each segment.

In consumer marketing, it is difficult to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as salt and sugar, which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea salt, rock salt, kosher salt, mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodized salt, salt substitutes, and many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined sugar, brown sugar, caster sugar, sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar, and a plethora of sugar substitutes including &quot;smart sugar&quot; which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed to meet the needs of specific market segments. Invert sugar and sugar syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate, and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments – refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while caster sugar and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.

Many factors are likely to affect a company&#x27;s segmentation strategy:

* Company resources: When resources are restricted, a concentrated strategy may be more effective.
* Product variability: For highly uniform products (such as sugar or steel) undifferentiated marketing may be more appropriate. For products that can be differentiated, (such as cars) then either a differentiated or concentrated approach is indicated.
* Product life cycle: For new products, one version may be used at the launch stage, but this may be expanded to a more segmented approach over time. As more competitors enter the market, it may be necessary to differentiate.
* Market characteristics: When all buyers have similar tastes or are unwilling to pay a premium for different quality, then undifferentiated marketing is indicated.
* Competitive activity: When competitors apply differentiated or concentrated market segmentation, using undifferentiated marketing may prove to be fatal. A company should consider whether it can use a different market segmentation approach

== Segmentation, targeting, positioning ==

The process of segmenting the market is deceptively simple. Marketers tend to use the so-called S-T-P process, that is Segmentation→ Targeting → Positioning, as a broad framework for simplifying the process. Segmentation comprises identifying the market to be segmented; identification, selection, and application of bases to be used in that segmentation; and development of profiles. Targeting comprises an evaluation of each segment&#x27;s attractiveness and selection of the segments to be targeted. Positioning comprises the identification of optimal positions and the development of the marketing program.

Perhaps the most important marketing decision a firm makes is the selection of one or more market segments on which to focus. A market segment is a portion of a larger market whose needs differ somewhat from the larger market. Since a market segment has unique needs, a firm that develops a total product focused solely on the needs of that segment will be able to meet the segment&#x27;s desires better than a firm whose product or service attempts to meet the needs of multiple segments.
Current research shows that, in practice, firms apply three variations of the S-T-P framework: ad-hoc segmentation, syndicated segmentation, and feral segmentation.
* Ad-Hoc segmentation closely resembles the original S-T-P framework in that firms initiate and conduct independently a market segmentation project. Firms focus on a category of offerings as the starting point for identifying a base of consumers and performing analysis to validate distinct consumption profiles. The resulting market segmentation profiles are often treated as trade secrets.
* Syndicated segmentation means that firms purchase segmentation frameworks that are commercially available from specialized firms that apply data science to generate consumer profiles. The resulting segments are available for commercial distribution, and clients can consult the segments for a fee. 
* Feral segmentation: is a process in which cultural intermediaries coin, circulate, and validate the consumer categories that some marketers use as market segments - consumer categories emerge, unsolicited, in popular culture. Segments are &quot;feral&quot; because consumer categories emerge in the public domain, unsolicited, without the direct involvement of professional marketers, outside managerial control, and without mobilizing the prescribed market research techniques.

== Identifying the market to be segmented ==
The market for any given product or service is known as the &quot;market potential&quot; or the &quot;total addressable market (TAM).&quot; Given that this is the market to be segmented, the market analyst should begin by identifying the size of the potential market. For existing products and services, estimating the size and value of the market potential is relatively straightforward. However, estimating the market potential can be very challenging when a product or service is new to the market and no historical data on which to base forecasts exists.

A basic approach is to first assess the size of the broad population, then estimate the percentage likely to use the product or service, and finally estimate the revenue potential.

Another approach is to use a historical analogy. For example, the manufacturer of HDTV might assume that the number of consumers willing to adopt high-definition TV will be similar to the adoption rate for color TV. To support this type of analysis, data for household penetration of TV, Radio, PCs, and other communications technologies are readily available from government statistics departments. Finding useful analogies can be challenging because every market is unique. However, analogous product adoption and growth rates can provide the analyst with benchmark estimates and can be used to cross-validate other methods that might be used to forecast sales or market size.

A more robust technique for estimating the market potential is known as the Bass diffusion model, the equation for which follows:

: N(&quot;t&quot;) – N(&quot;t&quot;−1) = [&quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;N(&quot;t&quot;−1)/&quot;m&quot;] × [&quot;m&quot; – N(&quot;t&quot;−1)]

Where:

* N(&quot;t&quot;)= the number of adopters in the current time period, (&quot;t&quot;)
* N(&quot;t&quot;−1)= the number of adopters in the previous time period, (&quot;t&quot;-1)
* &quot;p&quot; = the coefficient of innovation
* &quot;q&quot; = the coefficient of imitation (the social contagion influence)
* &quot;m&quot; = an estimate of the number of eventual adopters

The major challenge with the Bass model is estimating the parameters for &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. However, the Bass model has been so widely used in empirical studies that the values of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; for more than 50 consumer and industrial categories have been determined and are widely published in tables. The average value for &quot;p&quot; is 0.037 and for &quot;q&quot; is 0.327.

== Bases for segmenting consumer markets ==
A major step in the segmentation process is the selection of a suitable base. In this step, marketers are looking for a means of achieving internal homogeneity (similarity within the segments), and external heterogeneity (differences between segments). In other words, they are searching for a process that minimizes differences between members of a segment and maximizes differences between each segment. In addition, the segmentation approach must yield segments that are meaningful for the specific marketing problem or situation. For example, a person&#x27;s hair color may be a relevant base for a shampoo manufacturer, but it would not be relevant for a seller of financial services. Selecting the right base requires a good deal of thought and a basic understanding of the market to be segmented.

In reality, marketers can segment the market using any base or variable provided that it is identifiable, substantial, responsive, actionable, and stable.

* &quot;Identifiability&quot; refers to the extent to which managers can identify or recognize distinct groups within the marketplace.
* &quot;Substantiality&quot; refers to the extent to which a segment or group of customers represents a sufficient size to be profitable. This could mean being sufficiently large in number of people or purchasing power.
* &quot;Accessibility&quot; refers to the extent to which marketers can reach the targeted segments with promotional or distribution efforts.
* &quot;Responsiveness&quot; refers to the extent to which consumers in a defined segment will respond to marketing offers targeted at them.
* &quot;Actionable&quot; – segments are said to be actionable when they guide marketing decisions.

For example, although dress size is not a standard base for segmenting a market, some fashion houses have successfully segmented the market using women&#x27;s dress size as a variable. However, the most common bases for segmenting consumer markets include: geographics, demographics, psychographics, and behavior. Marketers normally select a single base for the segmentation analysis, although, some bases can be combined into a single segmentation with care. Combining bases is the foundation of an emerging form of segmentation known as ‘Hybrid Segmentation’ (see ). This approach seeks to deliver a single segmentation that is equally useful across multiple marketing functions such as brand positioning, product and service innovation as well as eCRM.

The following sections provide a description of the most common forms of consumer market segmentation.

=== Geographic segmentation ===

Geographic segmentation divides markets according to geographic criteria. In practice, markets can be segmented as broadly as continents and as narrowly as neighborhoods or postal codes. Typical geographic variables include:

* Country Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, UK, US
* Region Geographic area of a nation, North, North-west, Mid-west, South, Central
* Population density: central business district (CBD), urban, suburban, rural, regional
* City or town size: population under 1,000; 1,000–5,000; 5,000–10,000 ... 1,000,000–3,000,000, and over 3,000,000
* Climatic zone: Mediterranean, Temperate, Sub-Tropical, Tropical, Polar

The geo-cluster approach (also called &quot;geodemographic segmentation&quot;) combines demographic data with geographic data to create richer, more detailed profiles. Geo-cluster approaches are a consumer classification system designed for market segmentation and consumer profiling purposes. They classify residential regions or postcodes based on census and lifestyle characteristics obtained from a wide range of sources. This allows the segmentation of a population into smaller groups defined by individual characteristics such as demographic, socio-economic, or other shared socio-demographic characteristics.

Geographic segmentation may be considered the first step in international marketing, where marketers must decide whether to adapt their existing products and marketing programs to the unique needs of distinct geographic markets. Tourism Marketing Boards often segment international visitors based on their country of origin.

Several proprietary geo-demographic packages are available for commercial use. Geographic segmentation is widely used in direct marketing campaigns to identify areas that are potential candidates for personal selling, letter-box distribution, or direct mail. Geo-cluster segmentation is widely used by Governments and public sector departments such as urban planning, health authorities, police, criminal justice departments, telecommunications, and public utility organizations such as water boards.

=== Demographic segmentation ===
Segmentation according to demography is based on consumer demographic variables such as age, income, family size, socio-economic status, etc. Demographic segmentation assumes that consumers with similar demographic profiles will exhibit similar purchasing patterns, motivations, interests, and lifestyles and that these characteristics will translate into similar product/brand preferences. In practice, demographic segmentation can potentially employ any variable that is used by the nation&#x27;s census collectors. Examples of demographic variables and their descriptors include:

* Age: Under 5, 5–8 years, 9–12 years, 13–17 years, 18–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60+
* Gender: Male, Female
* Occupation: Professional, self-employed, semi-professional, clerical/ admin, sales, trades, mining, primary producer, student, home duties, unemployed, retired
* Socio-economic: A, B, C, D, E, or I, II, III, IV, or V (normally divided into quintiles)
* Marital Status: Single, married, divorced, widowed
* Family Life-stage: Young single; Young married with no children; Young family with children under 5 years; Older married with children; Older married with no children living at home, Older living alone
* Family size/ number of dependants: 0, 1–2, 3–4, 5+
* Income: Under $10,000; 10,000–20,000; 20,001–30,000; 30,001–40,000, 40,001–50,000 etc.
* Educational attainment: Primary school; Some secondary, Completed secondary, Some university, Degree; Postgraduate or higher degree
* Home ownership: Renting, Own home with a mortgage, Home owned outright
* Ethnicity: Asian, African, Aboriginal, Polynesian, Melanesian, Latin-American, African-American, American Indian, etc.
* Religion: Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Other

In practice, most demographic segmentation utilizes a combination of demographic variables.

The use of multiple segmentation variables normally requires the analysis of databases using sophisticated statistical techniques such as cluster analysis or principal components analysis. These types of analysis require very large sample sizes. However, data collection is expensive for individual firms. For this reason, many companies purchase data from commercial market research firms, many of whom develop proprietary software to interrogate the data.

The labels applied to some of the more popular demographic segments began to enter the popular lexicon in the 1980s. These include the following:

:: DINK: Double (or dual) Income, No Kids, describes one member of a couple with above-average household income and no dependent children, tend to exhibit discretionary expenditure on luxury goods and entertainment and dining out.
:: GLAM: Greying, Leisured and Moneyed. Retired older persons, asset rich, and high income. Tend to exhibit higher spending on recreation, travel, and entertainment.
:: GUPPY: (aka GUPPIE) Gay, Upwardly Mobile, Prosperous, Professional; a blend of gay and YUPPY (can also refer to the London-based equivalent of YUPPY).
:: MUPPY: (aka MUPPIE) Mid-aged, Upwardly Mobile, Prosperous, Professional.
:: Preppy: (American) Well-educated, well-off, upper-class young persons; a graduate of an expensive school. Often distinguished by a style of dress.
:: SITKOM: Single Income, Two Kids, Oppressive Mortgage. Tend to have very little discretionary income, and struggle to make ends meet.
:: Tween: Young person who is approaching puberty, aged approximately 9–12 years; too old to be considered a child, but too young to be a teenager; they are &#x27;in-between&#x27;.
:: WASP: (American) White, Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Tend to be high-status and influential white Americans of English Protestant ancestry.
:: YUPPY: (aka yuppie) Young, Urban/ Upwardly-mobile, Prosperous, Professional. Tend to be well-educated, career-minded, ambitious, affluent, and free spenders.

=== Psychographic segmentation ===
Psychographic segmentation, which is sometimes called psychometric or lifestyle segmentation, is measured by studying the activities, interests, and opinions (AIOs) of customers. It considers how people spend their leisure, and which external influences they are most responsive to and influenced by. Psychographics is a very widely used basis for segmentation because it enables marketers to identify tightly defined market segments and better understand consumer motivations for product or brand choice.

While many of these proprietary psychographic segmentation analyses are well-known, the majority of studies based on psychographics are custom-designed. That is, the segments are developed for individual products at a specific time. One common thread among psychographic segmentation studies is that they use quirky names to describe the segments.

=== Behavioural segmentation ===

Behavioural segmentation divides consumers into groups according to their observed behaviours. Many marketers believe that behavioural variables are superior to demographics and geographics for building market segments, and some analysts have suggested that behavioural segmentation is killing off demographics. Typical behavioural variables and their descriptors include:

* Purchase/Usage Occasion: regular occasion, special occasion, festive occasion, gift-giving
* Benefit-Sought: economy, quality, service level, convenience, access
* User Status: First-time user, Regular user, Non-user
* Usage Rate/Purchase Frequency: Light user, heavy user, moderate user
* Loyalty Status: Loyal, switcher, non-loyal, lapsed
* Buyer Readiness: Unaware, aware, intention to buy
* Attitude to Product or Service: Enthusiast, Indifferent, Hostile; Price Conscious, Quality Conscious
* Adopter Status: Early adopter, late adopter, laggard
* Scanner data from supermarket or credit card information data

Note that these descriptors are merely commonly used examples. Marketers customize the variables and descriptors for both local conditions and for specific applications. For example, in the health industry, planners often segment broad markets according to &#x27;health consciousness&#x27; and identify low, moderate, and highly health-conscious segments. This is an applied example of behavioural segmentation, using attitude to a product or service as a key descriptor or variable which has been customized for the specific application.

==== Purchase/usage occasion ====

Purchase or usage occasion segmentation focuses on analyzing occasions when consumers might purchase or consume a product. This approach customer-level and occasion-level segmentation models and provides an understanding of the individual customers’ needs, behaviour, and value under different occasions of usage and time. Unlike traditional segmentation models, this approach assigns more than one segment to each unique customer, depending on the current circumstances they are under.

==== Benefit-sought ====

Benefit segmentation (sometimes called &quot;needs-based segmentation&quot;) was developed by Grey Advertising in the late 1960s. The benefits-sought by purchasers enables the market to be divided into segments with distinct needs, perceived value, benefits sought, or advantage that accrues from the purchase of a product or service. Marketers using benefit segmentation might develop products with different quality levels, performance, customer service, special features, or any other meaningful benefit and pitch different products at each of the segments identified. Benefit segmentation is one of the more commonly used approaches to segmentation and is widely used in many consumer markets including motor vehicles, fashion and clothing, furniture, consumer electronics, and holiday-makers.

Loker and Purdue, for example, used benefit segmentation to segment the pleasure holiday travel market. The segments identified in this study were the naturalists, pure excitement seekers, and escapists.

==== Attitudinal segments ====

Attitudinal segmentation provides insight into the mindset of customers, especially the attitudes and beliefs that drive consumer decision-making and behaviour. An example of attitudinal segmentation comes from the UK&#x27;s Department of Environment which segmented the British population into six segments, based on attitudes that drive behaviour relating to environmental protection:

* Greens: Driven by the belief that protecting the environment is critical; try to conserve whenever they can
* Conscious with a conscience: Aspire to be &quot;green&quot;; primarily concerned with wastage; lack awareness of other behaviours associated with broader environmental issues such as climate change
* Currently constrained: Aspire to be &quot;green&quot; but feel they cannot afford to purchase organic products; pragmatic realists
* Basic contributors: Skeptical about the need for behaviour change; aspire to conform to social norms; lack awareness of social and environmental issues
* Long-term resistance: Have serious life priorities that take precedence before a behavioural change is a consideration; their everyday behaviours often have a low impact on the environment, but for other reasons than conservation
* Disinterested: View &quot;greenies&quot; as an eccentric minority; exhibit no interest in changing their behaviour; may be aware of climate change but have not internalized it to the extent that it enters their decision-making process.

=== Hybrid segmentation ===

One of the difficulties organisations face when implementing segmentation into their business processes is that segmentations developed using a single variable base, e.g. attitudes, are useful only for specific business functions. As an example, segmentations driven by functional needs (e.g. “I want home appliances that are very quiet”) can provide clear direction for product development, but tell little about how to position brands, or who to target on the customer database and with what tonality of messaging.

Hybrid segmentation is a family of approaches that specifically addresses this issue by combining two or more variable bases into a single segmentation. This emergence has been driven by three factors. First, the development of more powerful AI and machine learning algorithms to help attribute segmentations to customer databases; second, the rapid increase in the breadth and depth of data that is available to commercial organisations; third, the increasing prevalence of customer databases amongst companies (which generates the commercial demand for segmentation to be used for different purposes).

A successful example of hybrid segmentation came from the travel company TUI, which in 2018 developed a hybrid segmentation using a combination of geo-demographics, high-level category attitudes, and more specific holiday-related needs. Before the onset of Covid-19 travel restrictions, they credited this segmentation with having generated an incremental £50 million of revenue in the UK market alone in just over two years.

Facebook has recently developed what marketing professor Mark Ritson describes as a “very impressive” hybrid segmentation using a combination of behavioural, attitudinal, and demographic data.

With a clear break from the traditional paradigm of focusing on a single variable base, many marketers view hybrid segmentation as marking the beginning of a new era in segmentation.

=== Other types of consumer segmentation ===

In addition to geographics, demographics, psychographics, and behavioural bases, marketers occasionally turn to other means of segmenting the market or developing segment profiles.

==== Generational segments ====

A generation is defined as &quot;a cohort of people born within a similar period (15 years at the upper end) who share a comparable age and life stage and who were shaped by a particular period (events, trends, and developments).&quot; Generational segmentation refers to the process of dividing and analyzing a population into cohorts based on their birth date. Generational segmentation assumes that people&#x27;s values and attitudes are shaped by the key events that occurred during their lives and that these attitudes translate into product and brand preferences.

Demographers, studying population change, disagree about precise dates for each generation. Dating is normally achieved by identifying population peaks or troughs, which can occur at different times in each country. For example, in Australia the post-war population boom peaked in 1960, while the peak occurred somewhat later in the US and Europe, with most estimates converging on 1964. Accordingly, Australian Boomers are normally defined as those born between 1945 and 1960; while American and European Boomers are normally defined as those born between 1946 and 1964. Thus, the generational segments and their dates discussed here must be taken as approximations only.

The primary generational segments identified by marketers are:

* Builders: born 1920 to 1945
* Baby boomers: born about 1946–1964
* Generation X: born about 1965–1980
* Generation Y, also known as Millennials; born about 1981–1996
* Generation Z, also known as Zoomers; born 1997–2012

==== Cultural segmentation ====

Cultural segmentation is used to classify markets according to their cultural origin. Culture is a major dimension of consumer behaviour and can be used to enhance customer insight and as a component of predictive models. Cultural segmentation enables appropriate communications to be crafted for particular cultural communities. Cultural segmentation can be applied to existing customer data to measure market penetration in key cultural segments by product, brand, and channel as well as traditional measures of recency, frequency, and monetary value. These benchmarks form an important evidence base to guide strategic direction and tactical campaign activity, allowing engagement trends to be monitored over time.

Cultural segmentation can be combined with other bases, especially geographics so that segments are mapped according to state, region, suburb, and neighborhood. This provides a geographical market view of population proportions and may be of benefit in selecting appropriately located premises, determining territory boundaries, and local marketing activities.

Census data is a valuable source of cultural data but cannot meaningfully be applied to individuals. Name analysis (onomastics) is the most reliable and efficient means of describing the cultural origin of individuals. The accuracy of using name analysis as a surrogate for cultural background in Australia is between 80 and 85%, after allowing for female name changes due to marriage, social or political reasons, or colonial influence. The extent of name data coverage means a user will code a minimum of 99% of individuals with their most likely ancestral origin.

==== Online customer segmentation ====

Online market segmentation is similar to the traditional approaches in that the segments should be identifiable, substantial, accessible, stable, differentiable, and actionable. Customer data stored in online data management systems such as a CRM or DMP enables the analysis and segmentation of consumers across a diverse set of attributes. Forsyth et al., in an article &#x27;Internet research&#x27; grouped current active online consumers into six groups: Simplifiers, Surfers, Bargainers, Connectors, Routiners, and Sportsters. The segments differ regarding four customers&#x27; behaviours, namely:

* The amount of time they actively spend online,
* The number of pages and sites they access,
* The time they spend actively viewing each page,
* And the kinds of sites they visit.

For example, &quot;Simplifiers&quot; make up over 50% of all online transactions. Their main characteristic is that they need easy (one-click) access to information and products as well as easy and quickly available service regarding products. Amazon is an example of a company that created an online environment for Simplifiers. They also &#x27;dislike unsolicited e-mail, uninviting chat rooms, pop-up windows intended to encourage impulse buys, and other features that complicate their on- and off-line experience&#x27;. Surfers like to spend a lot of time online, thus companies must have a variety of products to offer and constant updates, &quot;Bargainers&quot; are looking for the best price, Connectors like to relate to others, &quot;Routiners&quot; want content, and &quot;Sportsters&quot; like sport and entertainment sites.

== Selecting target markets ==

Another major decision in developing the segmentation strategy is the selection of market segments that will become the focus of special attention (known as &quot;target markets&quot;). The marketer faces important decisions:

* What criteria should be used to evaluate markets?
* How many markets to enter (one, two, or more)?
* Which market segments are the most valuable?

When a marketer enters more than one market, the segments are often labeled the &quot;primary target market&quot; and &quot;secondary target market.&quot; The primary market is the target market selected as the main focus of marketing activities. The secondary target market is likely to be a segment that is not as large as the primary market, but has growth potential. Alternatively, the secondary target group might consist of a small number of purchasers that account for a relatively high proportion of sales volume perhaps due to purchase value or purchase frequency.

In terms of evaluating markets, three core considerations are essential:

* Segment size and growth
* Segment structural attractiveness
* Company objectives and resources.

=== Criteria for evaluating segment attractiveness ===

There are no formulas for evaluating the attractiveness of market segments and a good deal of judgment must be exercised. There are approaches to assist in evaluating market segments for overall attractiveness. The following lists a series of questions to evaluate target segments.

==== Segment size and growth ====
* How large is the market?
* Is the market segment substantial enough to be profitable? (Segment size can be measured in the number of customers, but superior measures are likely to include sales value or volume)
* Is the market segment growing or contracting?
* What are the indications that growth will be sustained in the long term? Is any observed growth sustainable?
* Is the segment stable over time? (Segment must have sufficient time to reach desired performance level)

==== Segment structural attractiveness ====
* To what extent are competitors targeting this market segment?
* Do buyers have bargaining power in the market?
* Are substitute products available?
* Can we carve out a viable position to differentiate from any competitors?
* How responsive are members of the market segment to the marketing program?
* Is this market segment reachable and accessible? (i.e., concerning distribution and promotion)

==== Company objectives and resources ====
* Is this market segment aligned with our company&#x27;s operating philosophy?
* Do we have the resources necessary to enter this market segment?
* Do we have prior experience with this market segment or similar market segments?
* Do we have the skills and/or know-how to enter this market segment successfully?

== Developing the marketing program and positioning strategy ==


When the segments have been determined and separate offers developed for each of the core segments, the marketer&#x27;s next task is to design a marketing program (also known as the marketing mix) that will resonate with the target market or markets. Developing the marketing program requires a deep knowledge of key market segments&#x27; purchasing habits, their preferred retail outlet, their media habits, and their price sensitivity. The marketing program for each brand or product should be based on the understanding of the target market (or target markets) revealed in the market profile.

Positioning is the final step in the S-T-P planning approach; Segmentation → Targeting → Positioning. It is a core framework for developing marketing plans and setting objectives. Positioning refers to decisions about how to present the offer in a way that resonates with the target market. During the research and analysis that forms the central part of segmentation and targeting, the marketer will gain insights into what motivates consumers to purchase a product or brand. These insights will form part of the positioning strategy.

According to advertising guru, David Ogilvy, &quot;Positioning is the act of designing the company’s offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the minds of the target market. The goal is to locate the brand in the minds of consumers to maximize the potential benefit to the firm. A good brand positioning helps guide marketing strategy by clarifying the brand’s essence, what goals it helps the consumer achieve, and how it does so in a unique way.&quot;

The technique known as perceptual mapping is often used to understand consumers&#x27; mental representations of brands within a given category. Traditionally two variables (often, but not necessarily, price and quality) are used to construct the map. A sample of people in the target market are asked to explain where they would place various brands in terms of the selected variables. Results are averaged across all respondents, and results are plotted on a graph, as illustrated in the figure. The final map indicates how the &quot;average&quot; member of the population views the brand that makes up a category and how each of the brands relates to other brands within the same category. While perceptual maps with two dimensions are common, multi-dimensional maps are also used.

There are different approaches to positioning:

# Against a competitor
# Within a category
# According to product benefit
# According to product attribute
# For usage occasion
# Along price lines e.g. a luxury brand or premium brand
# For a user
# Cultural symbols e.g. Australia&#x27;s Easter Bilby (as a culturally appropriate alternative to the Easter Bunny).

== Basis for segmenting business markets ==
Segmenting business markets is more straightforward than segmenting consumer markets. Businesses may be segmented according to industry, business size, business location, turnover, number of employees, company technology, purchasing approach, or any other relevant variables. The most widely used segmentation bases used in business to business markets are geographics and firmographics.

The most widely used bases for segmenting business markets are:

: Geographic segmentation occurs when a firm seeks to identify the most promising geographic markets to enter. Businesses can tap into business census-type products published by Government departments to identify geographic regions that meet certain predefined criteria.

: Firmographics (also known as &quot;emporographics&quot; or &quot;feature-based segmentation&quot;) is the business community&#x27;s answer to demographic segmentation. It is commonly used in business-to-business markets (an estimated 81% of B2B marketers use this technique). Under this approach the target market is segmented based on features such as company size, industry sector or location usage rate, purchase frequency, number of years in business, ownership factors, and buying situation.

:: Key firmographic variables: standard industry classification (SIC); company size (either in terms of revenue or number of employees), industry sector or location (country and/or region), usage rate, purchase frequency, number of years in business, ownership factors and buying situation

== Use in customer retention ==
The basic approach to retention-based segmentation is that a company tags each of its active customers on four axes:

; Risk of customer cancellation of company service
: One of the most common indicators of high-risk customers is a drop off in usage of the company&#x27;s service. For example, in the credit card industry, this could be signaled through a customer&#x27;s decline in spending on his or her card.
; Risk of customer switching to a competitor
: Many times customers move purchase preferences to a competitor brand. This may happen for many reasons those of which can be more difficult to measure. It is many times beneficial for the former company to gain meaningful insights, through data analysis, as to why this change of preference has occurred. Such insights can lead to effective strategies for winning back the customer or on how not to lose the target customer in the first place.
; Customer retention worthiness
: This determination boils down to whether the post-retention profit generated from the customer is predicted to be greater than the cost incurred to retain the customer and includes evaluation of customer lifecycles.

This analysis of customer lifecycles is usually included in the growth plan of a business to determine which tactics to implement to retain or let go of customers. Tactics commonly used range from providing special customer discounts to sending customers communications that reinforce the value proposition of the given service.

== Segmentation: algorithms and approaches ==

The choice of an appropriate statistical method for the segmentation depends on numerous factors that may include, the broad approach (a-priori or post-hoc), the availability of data, time constraints, the marketer&#x27;s skill level, and resources.

=== A-priori segmentation ===

A priori research occurs when &quot;a theoretical framework is developed before the research is conducted&quot;. In other words, the marketer has an idea about whether to segment the market geographically, demographically, psychographically or behaviourally before undertaking any research. For example, a marketer might want to learn more about the motivations and demographics of light and moderate users to understand what tactics could be used to increase usage rates. In this case, the target variable is known – the marketer has already segmented using a behavioural variable – user status. The next step would be to collect and analyze attitudinal data for light and moderate users. The typical analysis includes simple cross-tabulations, frequency distributions, and occasionally logistic regression or one of several proprietary methods.

The main disadvantage of a-priori segmentation is that it does not explore other opportunities to identify market segments that could be more meaningful.

=== Post-hoc segmentation ===

In contrast, post-hoc segmentation makes no assumptions about the optimal theoretical framework. Instead, the analyst&#x27;s role is to determine the segments that are the most meaningful for a given marketing problem or situation. In this approach, the empirical data drives the segmentation selection. Analysts typically employ some type of clustering analysis or structural equation modeling to identify segments within the data. Post-hoc segmentation relies on access to rich datasets, usually with a very large number of cases, and uses sophisticated algorithms to identify segments.

The figure alongside illustrates how segments might be formed using clustering; however, note that this diagram only uses two variables, while in practice clustering employs a large number of variables.

=== Statistical techniques used in segmentation ===
Marketers often engage commercial research firms or consultancies to carry out segmentation analysis, especially if they lack the statistical skills to undertake the analysis. Some segmentation, especially post-hoc analysis, relies on sophisticated statistical analysis.

Common statistical approaches and techniques used in segmentation analysis include:

* Clustering algorithms – overlapping, non-overlapping and fuzzy methods; e.g. K-means or other Cluster analysis
* Conjoint analysis
* Ensemble approaches – such as random forests
* Chi-square automatic interaction detection – a type of decision-tree
* Factor analysis or principal components analysis
* Latent Class Analysis – a generic term for a class of methods that attempt to detect underlying clusters based on observed patterns of association
* Logistic regression
* Multidimensional scaling and canonical analysis
* Mixture models – e.g., EM estimation algorithm, finite-mixture models
* Model-based segmentation using simultaneous and structural equation modeling e.g. LISREL
* Other algorithms such as artificial neural networks.

=== Data sources used for segmentation ===

Marketers use a variety of data sources for segmentation studies and market profiling. Typical sources of information include:

==== Internal sources ====
* Customer transaction records e.g. sale value per transaction, purchase frequency
* Patron membership records e.g. active members, lapsed members, length of membership
* Customer relationship management (CRM) databases
* In-house surveys
* Customer self-completed questionnaires or feedback forms

==== External sources ====
* Commissioned research (where the business commissions a research study and maintains exclusive rights to the data; typically the most expensive means of data collection)
* Data-mining techniques
* Census data (population and business census)
* Observed purchase behaviours
* Government agencies and departments
* Government statistics and surveys (e.g. studies by departments of trade, industry, technology, etc.)
* Omnibus surveys (a standard, regular survey with a basic set of questions about demographics and lifestyles where an individual can add specific sets of questions about product preference or usage; generally lower cost than commissioned survey methods)
* Professional/Industry associations/Employer associations
* Proprietary surveys or tracking studies (also known as &quot;syndicated research&quot;; studies carried out by market research companies where businesses can purchase the right to access part of the data set)
* Proprietary databases/software

<text>Genre art is the pictorial representation in any of various media of scenes or events from everyday life, such as markets, domestic settings, interiors, parties, inn scenes, work, and street scenes. Such representations (also called genre works, genre scenes, or genre views) may be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Some variations of the term &quot;genre art&quot; specify the medium or type of visual work, as in &quot;genre painting&quot;, &quot;genre prints&quot;, &quot;genre photographs&quot;, and so on.

The following concentrates on painting, but genre motifs were also extremely popular in many forms of the decorative arts, especially from the Rococo of the early 18th century onwards. Single figures or small groups decorated a huge variety of objects such as porcelain, furniture, wallpaper, and textiles.

==Genre painting==

&quot;Genre painting&quot;, also called &quot;genre scene&quot; or &quot;petit genre&quot;, depicts aspects of everyday life by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing &quot;petit genre&quot; from history paintings (also called &quot;grand genre&quot;) and portraits. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the bourgeoisie, or middle class. Genre themes appear in nearly all art traditions. Painted decorations in ancient Egyptian tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and Peiraikos is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a Hellenistic panel painter of &quot;low&quot; subjects, such as survive in mosaic versions and provincial wall-paintings at Pompeii: &quot;barbers&#x27; shops, cobblers&#x27; stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects&quot;. Medieval illuminated manuscripts often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the &quot;Labours of the Months&quot; in the calendar section of books of hours, most famously Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry.

===To 1800===

The Low Countries dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both Flemish Baroque painting and Dutch Golden Age painting produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes. In the previous century, the Flemish Renaissance painter Jan Sanders van Hemessen painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century. These were part of a pattern of &quot;Mannerist inversion&quot; in Antwerp painting, giving &quot;low&quot; elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis. Joachim Patinir expanded his landscapes, making the figures a small element, and Pieter Aertsen painted works dominated by spreads of still life food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background. Pieter Brueghel the Elder made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel&#x27;s wake.
 Adriaen and Isaac van Ostade, Jan Steen, Adriaen Brouwer, David Teniers, Aelbert Cuyp, Johannes Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists&#x27; paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular &quot;emblem&quot; from an emblem book. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in Gabriel Metsu&#x27;s &quot;The Poultry seller&quot;, 1662, showing an old man offering a rooster in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene. The &quot;merry company&quot; showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities (&quot;kermesse&quot;), or soldiers in camp.
In Italy, a &quot;school&quot; of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in Rome of the Dutch painter Pieter van Laer in 1625. He acquired the nickname &quot;Il Bamboccio&quot; and his followers were called the &quot;Bamboccianti&quot;, whose works would inspire Giacomo Ceruti, Antonio Cifrondi, and Giuseppe Maria Crespi among many others.

Louis le Nain was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the romanticized paintings of Watteau and Fragonard, or the careful realism of Chardin. Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, William Hogarth (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people full of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating The Book of Good Love of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and illuminators. At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many picaresque genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as bodegones—were painted by the artists of The Spanish Golden Age, notably Velázquez (1599–1660) and Murillo (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and printmaking as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His &quot;The Disasters of War&quot;, a series of 82 genre incidents from the Peninsular War, took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

===19th century===


With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. Realists such as Gustave Courbet (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for &quot;important&quot; subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a &quot;minor&quot; category. History painting itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the Troubador style. This trend, already apparent by 1817 when Ingres painted &quot;Henri IV Playing with His Children&quot;, culminated in the pompier art of French academicians such as Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904) and Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier (1815–91). In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

William Powell Frith (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include Augustus Leopold Egg, Frederick Daniel Hardy, George Elgar Hicks, William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. Scotland produced two influential genre painters, David Allan (1744–96) and Sir David Wilkie (1785–1841). Wilkie&#x27;s &quot;The Cottar&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter Gustave Courbet, &quot;After Dinner at Ornans&quot; (1849). Famous Russian realist painters like Pavel Fedotov, Vasily Perov, and Ilya Repin also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, Carl Spitzweg (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy Gerolamo Induno (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the Impressionists, as well as such 20th-century artists as Pierre Bonnard, Itshak Holtz, Edward Hopper, and David Park painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term &quot;genre painting&quot; has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant John Lewis Krimmel, who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812 to 1821. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include George Caleb Bingham, William Sidney Mount, and Eastman Johnson. Harry Roseland focused on scenes of poor African Americans in the post-American Civil War South, and John Rogers (1829–1904) was a sculptor whose small genre works, mass-produced in cast plaster, were immensely popular in America. The works of American painter Ernie Barnes (1938–2009) and those of illustrator Norman Rockwell (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

===Genre in other traditions===
Japanese ukiyo-e prints are rich in depictions of people at leisure and at work, as are Korean paintings, particularly those created in the 18th century.

==Genre photography==
While genre painting began, in the 17th century, with representations by Europeans of European life, the invention and early development of photography coincided with the most expansive and aggressive era of European imperialism, in the mid-to-late 19th century, and so genre photographs, typically made in the proximity of military, scientific and commercial expeditions, often also depict the people of other cultures that Europeans encountered throughout the world.

Although the distinctions are not clear, genre works should be distinguished from ethnographic studies, which are pictorial representations resulting from direct observation and descriptive study of the culture and way of life of particular societies, and which constitute one class of products of such disciplines as anthropology and the behavioural sciences.

The development of photographic technology to make cameras portable and exposures instantaneous enabled photographers to venture beyond the studio to follow other art forms in the depiction of everyday life. This category has come to be known as street photography.

<doc id="240348" wikidata="Q938987" url="?curid=240348" title="Roy Romanow">
<text>Roy John Romanow (born August 12, 1939) is a Canadian politician who served as the 12th premier of Saskatchewan from 1991 to 2001. He was the leader of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party from 1987 until his retirement in 2001. He was the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Saskatoon Riversdale from 1967 to 1982 and from 1986 to 2001.

Romanow played a prominent role in Allan Blakeney&#x27;s NDP government from 1971 to 1982, particularly in negotiations over Patriation of the Canadian Constitution. He became the Leader of the Opposition in 1987 before leading the NDP to three consecutive election victories in the 1990s. His time as premier left a divisive legacy within Saskatchewan&#x27;s political history. When Romanow first took office, Saskatchewan was facing the prospect of bankruptcy. His fiscal management brought the province back to balanced finances by the middle of the decade. However, his embrace of Third Way neoliberal politics disillusioned many within the NDP. Moreover, the perception that his cuts to spending disproportionately impacted rural Saskatchewan deepened an already growing divide between urban and rural issues and voters in the province, which factored prominently into future elections.

==Early life==
Romanow was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1939 to Tekla and Michael Romanow, who were Ukrainian immigrants from Ordiv—currently Chervonohrad Raion—Ukraine. His first language was Ukrainian.

He studied at the University of Saskatchewan, earning bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Political science in 1960 and Law in 1964 while involving himself heavily in student politics—he served a year as president of the Students&#x27; Representative Council. Romanow then practiced law, articling with and joining Goldenburg, Taylor and Company in Saskatoon. He married Eleanore Boykowich in 1967.

==Early political career (1967–1982)==

===MLA and NDP leadership bid===
Romanow was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a member of the CCF-NDP in the 1967 provincial election in the riding of Saskatoon Riversdale; the election was won by Ross Thatcher&#x27;s Liberals. When Woodrow Lloyd resigned as party leader in 1970, the young Romanow entered the race to succeed him as leader of the NDP. Romanow was considered the most conservative of four candidates as he was joined by Allan Blakeney, a veteran civil servant and MLA in the governments of Lloyd and Tommy Douglas; Don Mitchell, an agrarian activist who represented the socialist Waffle faction of the party; and George Taylor, a labour candidate. Romanow led narrowly on the first and second ballots. The delegated election came down to a final ballot featuring Romanow and Blakeney, and Blakeney won with 54% of the vote.

===Blakeney government===
Romanow was re-elected in the 1971 provincial election, which resulted in a majority government for Blakeney and the NDP. Blakeney immediately offered his former leadership rival prominent cabinet posts—Romanow served as Attorney General and Deputy Premier for Blakeney&#x27;s entire tenure as premier, from 1971 to 1982. This meant Romanow played a role in many of the key achievements of the NDP in this era, including the nationalization of the potash industry and battles with the federal government over resource rights and taxation, as well as Patriation of the Constitution.

During the 1981 discussions over Patriation of the Constitution, federal Minister of Justice Jean Chrétien, Ontario Attorney General Roy McMurtry, Romanow, and Saskatchewan&#x27;s director of constitutional law, John Whyte, worked out the final details of Canada&#x27;s new constitutional provisions, resulting in the late-night Kitchen Accord. Romanow objected strongly to any protections on private property in the new Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and none were included.

After three consecutive majority governments, Blakeney&#x27;s NDP were swept from power in the 1982 election in a shocking upset by Grant Devine&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives. Romanow himself was upset in Saskatoon Centre, losing to 23-year-old PC candidate Jo-Ann Zazelenchuk by 19 votes.

==Late political career (1986–2001)==

=== Return and Opposition Leader (1986–1991) ===
Romanow ran to reclaim his seat from Zazelenchuk in the 1986 election, and he won with nearly 70% of the vote. The NDP largely rebounded in 1986, narrowly winning the popular vote, but Devine&#x27;s PCs secured a second majority government with a particularly strong performance in rural Saskatchewan. The result led Blakeney, who had stayed on as Opposition leader after the loss in 1982, to resign as party leader. Romanow ran to succeed Blakeney, and with no challengers was acclaimed the new NDP leader—and leader of the Opposition—on November 7, 1987.

It became clear during the PCs second term that the province&#x27;s finances were in dire straits. The PCs ran a succession of large budget deficits, which peaked in 1986–87 at $1.2 billion, rapidly increasing the provincial debt. Devine used the fiscal situation as justification to pursue the privatization of a wide range of crown corporations—including PotashCorp, one of the key achievements of the Blakeney era—which engendered fierce opposition from the NDP. The situation came to a head in 1989 when the government moved to privatize SaskEnergy, the natural gas division of SaskPower; in response, Romanow led a legislative walk-out of the Opposition, effectively bringing government business to a halt. After 17 days, the government relented and ended the sell-off of SaskEnergy. When legislation to privatize PotashCorp was introduced later in 1989, the NDP, buoyed by its success with SaskEnergy, remained in the Legislature, ready to debate the legislation; however, the PCs enacted closure for the first time in provincial history to avoid debate on the issue and move forward with the legislation with no public scrutiny. The PCs were persistently criticized late in their term for undemocratic tactics including prorogation of the Legislature and the dubious use of special warrants for spending.

Devine&#x27;s PCs, which were clearly deeply unpopular, put off the next election as long as legally possible. When it finally occurred, Romanow led the NDP to a landslide majority government in the 1991 provincial election, winning 55 out of 66 seats, making Romanow Premier.

=== Premier of Saskatchewan (1991–2001) ===
When Romanow assumed office in 1991, the extent of the fiscal crisis facing the province began to become clearer. The provincial debt had reached nearly $15 billion under the Progressive Conservatives, and the province was facing the prospect of bankruptcy; interest payments on debt alone were accounting for more than 20% of government spending, second only to healthcare. Romanow had campaigned on getting the province&#x27;s fiscal house back in order, and dealing with the fiscal crisis became his government&#x27;s top priority.

==== Economic policy ====
In justifying his prioritization of the fiscal crisis, Romanow appealed to the previous CCF/NDP regimes of Blakeney and Tommy Douglas who, despite increasing the size and role of the government and its spending, prioritized sound fiscal management and balanced budgets. However, in their approach to dealing with the crisis, Romanow and finance minister Janice MacKinnon practiced austerity, greatly reducing government spending by downsizing the government and cutting services. They cited pressure from bondholders and a lack of assistance from the federal government as factors that increased the pressure to drastically reduce spending. Some of the most controversial cuts including reforming provincial health care—replacing more than one hundred hospital boards with approximately thirty health regions, and ending acute-care in more than fifty rural hospitals—and ending the Gross Revenue Insurance Plan, which had directly supported crop farm incomes. Such cuts were seen as disproportionately targeting rural life in the province. Moreover, Romanow&#x27;s governments adopted some of the same tactics the PCs had introduced to pass legislation, including closure when it came to their health care reforms. The cuts to programs and services in rural Saskatchewan were deeply unpopular and would prove costly to the NDP in those regions. However, such measures did lead to a balanced budget by 1995, sooner than had been expected and effectively ending concerns about the fiscal crisis. After 1995, Romanow&#x27;s government ran successive surpluses and paid the debt down to approximately $10 billion.

==== Re-elections and retirement ====
Romanow led the NDP to a second majority in the 1995 provincial election. The PCs were reduced to third-party status amid revelations of a major expense fraud scandal stemming from their last term in government, while the Liberals under Lynda Haverstock surged to Opposition status. However, the NDP&#x27;s seemingly solid grip on government and the growing frustrations of rural regions provided an impetus for a reorganization of conservatives in the province. In 1997, working behind the scenes with members of the federal Reform Party, four PC MLAs, including new leader Bill Boyd, and four Liberal MLAs—all from rural ridings—walked away from their parties and established the Saskatchewan Party. With eight MLAs, the new party immediately took over Opposition status. In 1998, it chose former Reform MP Elwin Hermanson as its first leader. Romanow framed the new party as an effort to rebrand the moribund Progressive Conservatives and took to referring to them as the &quot;Saskatories&quot;.

The NDP were widely expected to secure another majority in the 1999 provincial election. The party was re-elected to a third consecutive term, but was in fact reduced to a minority of seats in the legislature, forcing Romanow to negotiate a coalition government with the Liberals, an agreement that resulted in appointing three Liberals to Cabinet. This was the result of a strong performance by Hermanson&#x27;s party—which actually edged the NDP in the popular vote—in rural areas; the Saskatchewan Party won 25 seats, but none in either Regina or Saskatoon. Hermanson capitalized on rural discontent with the NDP, characterizing spending cuts there as the NDP&#x27;s &quot;rural revenge&quot;, putting into stark relief the growing divide between urban and rural voters in the province. Critics of Romanow&#x27;s austerity politics pointed to declining party membership and voter engagement as troubling factors in the election.

In 2000, less than a year after the election, Romanow announced that he would be retiring as soon as a successor was chosen by the party. The announcement triggered a hotly contested leadership race with seven candidates—a far cry from Romanow&#x27;s acclimation in 1987—with differing views for the future of the party. Anti-neoliberal candidate Nettie Wiebe placed third in the 2001 leadership vote, while Romanow&#x27;s attorney general Chris Axworthy was defeated on the final ballot by former cabinet minister Lorne Calvert, who was sworn in as premier on February 8, 2001. Calvert had campaigned on the party&#x27;s traditional social democratic values and a commitment to increase social spending. After Romanow&#x27;s resignation, Calvert also succeeded him as MLA for Saskatoon Riversdale, winning the by-election there on March 19, 2001.

==Life after politics==

===Federal arena===

Jean Chrétien&#x27;s federal Liberal Party—a party with which Romanow had worked closely on Patriation in the early 1980s—encouraged Romanow to run for the party, but he declined. He stated that to do so would be a betrayal of the NDP, and he bargained instead for the opportunity to lead a Royal commission on the future of health care. Romanow ultimately got his wish, and on April 4 2001, Romanow was appointed to head the Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of Chrétien. The Romanow Report was released in 2002, outlining suggestions to improve the health care system. The Report urged the protection and strengthening of Canada&#x27;s public health care system, calling for increased federal funding and a Health Charter outlining fundamental health care principles. The Report has remained influential in health care discussions for decades.

In 2003, Romanow was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada by Governor General Clarkson, again on the advice of Prime Minister Chrétien.

===Academic positions and honours===
After retiring from politics, Romanow became a senior policy fellow at the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Regina, as well as a visiting fellow at Queen&#x27;s University. In 2016, he was named Chancellor of the University of Saskatchewan, a role he filled until the end of his term in 2019 when he remained a policy fellow at the university.

In 2003, Romanow was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, and in 2004 was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Romanow&#x27;s official portrait was unveiled at Saskatchewan&#x27;s Legislative Assembly in 2005, when he received the Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan from Lieutenant Governor Lynda Haverstock.

== Legacy ==
Romanow&#x27;s tenure as premier left a divisive legacy. His government inherited a dire fiscal crisis, and their actions are credited with getting the province&#x27;s finances back in order. However, the pace at which Romanow&#x27;s government addressed the problem, and the economic austerity it implemented in order to do so, have been subject to debate. Critics from the traditional left wing of the NDP like John Conway and John Warnock, along with former leadership candidate Nettie Wiebe, charged Romanow with embracing neoliberalism and effectively betraying the NDP&#x27;s social democratic tradition. Others have conceded that Romanow was more fiscally conservative than would be expected from an NDP leader, but have underscored his commitment to social democratic values. His approach preserved a large activist role for government as well as a social safety net and investments in health care and education. Howard Leeson, who worked with Romanow in the Blakeney government, wrote that Romanow had a &quot;conservative approach to politics, tempered by a genuine concern for social needs&quot;, characterizing him as more of a &quot;red tory&quot; than a neoliberal. Other observers, like historian Bill Waiser and political analyst Dale Eisler, have argued that the globalized economy in which Romanow operated left fewer options than were available to his NDP predecessors, and drastic actions were necessary to deal with the crisis.

Ultimately, Romanow&#x27;s embrace of Third Way politics signaled an entrenchment of neoliberal economics in the province. David McGrane concluded that, while Romanow&#x27;s successor Lorne Calvert steered the NDP back further towards the left in terms of social policy, it effectively carried forward its economic legacy. Even the fledgling conservative Saskatchewan Party found little to criticize with NDP economic policy at the turn of the century, focusing its criticism on the NDP&#x27;s &quot;management style&quot; rather than its economic ideology. The other lasting legacy of the Romanow era was a solidification of the rural-urban divide in Saskatchewan. That divide had been widened by the Devine Progressive Conservative government&#x27;s rural emphasis; Romanow&#x27;s austerity, which was seen as disproportionately impacting rural areas, heightened the polarization and made the NDP deeply unpopular there.

<text>In linguistics, a compound verb or complex predicate is a multi-word compound that functions as a single verb. One component of the compound is a &quot;light verb&quot; or &quot;vector&quot;, which carries any inflections, indicating tense, mood, or aspect, but provides only fine shades of meaning. The other, &quot;primary&quot;, component is a verb or noun which carries most of the semantics of the compound, and determines its arguments. It is usually in either base or [in Verb + Verb compounds] &quot;conjunctive participial&quot; form. 

A compound verb is also called a &quot;complex predicate&quot; because the semantics, as formally modeled by a predicate, is determined by the primary verb, though both verbs appear in the surface form. Whether Noun+Verb (N+V) compounds are considered to be &quot;compound verbs&quot; is a matter of naming convention. Generally, the term &quot;complex predicate&quot; usually includes N+V compounds, whereas the term &quot;compound verb&quot; is usually reserved for V+V compounds. However, several authors [especially Iranists] refer to N+V compounds as compound verbs.

Compound verbs are to be distinguished from serial verbs which typically signify a sequence of actions, and in which the verbs are relatively equal in semantic and grammatical weight. They are also to be distinguished from sequences of auxiliary plus main verbs.

==Structure==
Thus, there are two classes of complex predicates:
# V+V compounds: One type of compound verb, where the second verb (rarely the first...) is a &quot;light verb&quot; (LV) is preceded by (rarely followed by ...) a primary or &quot;heavy verb&quot;. With a few exceptions all V+V compound verbs alternate with their simple counterparts. That is, removing the light verb / vector does not affect grammaticality at all nor the meaning very much: निकल गया – نِکَل گَیا &quot;nikal gayā&quot; {exit + WENT} versus निकला – نِکلا &quot;nikalā&quot; {exited}, both meaning &#x27;(I/you/he) went out.&#x27; In a few languages both components of the compound verb can be finite forms: Kurukh &quot;kecc-ar ker-ar&quot; lit. &quot;died-3pl went-3pl&quot; &#x27;(They) died.&#x27;
# N+V compounds: A compound with Noun+verb, converting the noun into a verbal structure; the arguments and the semantics are determined by the N and the tense markers / inflections are carried by the V, especially with LVs such as &quot;do,&quot; &quot;take,&quot; &quot;give,&quot; etc. Examples in English include stretched verb examples like &quot;take a walk&quot; or &quot;commit suicide&quot;. Some of the verbs participating in N+V compounds also participate as LVs in V+V compounds. [However, the common verb &quot;do&quot; rarely participates as LV in V+V compounds.] Unlike V+V compounds, N+V compounds appear in almost all languages of the world.

==Languages with compound verbs==
Compound verbs of both types (V+V and N+V) are very common in all the languages of India, though V+V compounds are more frequent in the northern Indo-Aryan languages than in Dravidian languages. In addition to South Asian languages, V+V compounds occur in Turkic languages like Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Uyghur, in Tibeto-Burman languages like Limbu and Newari, in Korean and Japanese, in northeast Caucasian languages like Tsez and Avar, and in Quichua, a variety of Quechua. The Indo-European language Greek also possesses some verb–verb compounds. V+V compounds do not occur in Iranian languages. What are called &quot;compound verbs&quot; by Iranists are N+V compounds.

===English===
The English lexicon contains a few true compound verbs, such as &quot;stirfry&quot;, &quot;kickstart&quot; and &quot;forcefeed&quot;. These are not serial verbs – though, as with many compounds, they may be spelled as two words (or hyphenated). Rather, the first verb expresses how the action expressed by the second verb is carried out. The second verb is the only one which may express tense. 

English also expresses aspectual distinctions as to the beginning, duration, completion, or repetition of an action using auxiliaries. Examples here include &quot;was starting&quot;, &quot;had lived&quot;, &quot;had been seen&quot;, etc. These sequences function in place of morphologically complex predicates like the inchoative or inceptive stems of Latin (, &#x27;I love&#x27;; , &#x27;I&#x27;m starting to love&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;m falling in love&#x27;; , &#x27;to flower&#x27;; , &#x27;to start flowering&#x27;; etc.), and of Russian (, , &#x27;to laugh&#x27;; , &#x27;to start laughing&#x27;).

Though verb + verb compounds are rare in English, one may illustrate the form with the example &quot;to go crashing [through the door]&quot;. In some interpretations, one may consider &quot;go&quot; as a light verb, which carries markers like tense. However, the main part of the meaning, as well as the arguments, i.e. answers to questions such as &quot;who?&quot; (agent) or &quot;what was it that &quot;went crashing&quot;?&quot; (subject), are determined by the second, semantically primary verb, &quot;crash&quot;. &quot;Go&quot; carries plural/tense markers (&quot;they go | he goes crashing&quot;), whereas &quot;crashing&quot; appears in this fixed form and does not change with tense, number, gender, etc. Whether gerundive forms like &quot;went crashing&quot; are compound verbs is controversial in English; many linguists prefer to treat &quot;crashing&quot; as a nominal in its gerundive form. However, the compound verb treatment may have some advantages, particularly when it comes to semantic analysis. For example, in response to &quot;She went crashing&quot;, the question &quot;Where did she go?&quot; is less revealing than &quot;Where did she go crashing?&quot;.

English has many examples of noun + verb compound predicates, called stretched verbs, which combine a light verb with an &quot;eventive&quot; noun (an action-describing noun which can also operate as a verb, though it may have become an uncommon one), or with a noun phrase composed of such a noun and one or more prepositions. Common examples include: to &quot;offer [one&#x27;s] condolences&quot;, to &quot;take a bite out of&quot;, and to &quot;get rid of&quot; (while &quot;to rid&quot; and &quot;to condole&quot; are infrequent).

Sometimes examples labeled serial verbs turn out to be compound verbs, as in &quot;What did you &quot;go and do&quot; that for?&quot; and &quot;Your business might just &quot;get up and leave&quot;.&quot;

Another variety of open-compound verb is common in English, German, and some other languages: The phrasal verb is in one in which a verb word and a preposition, particle, or both act together as a unit which does not convey what the words would indicate when taken literally. Examples include to &quot;think&quot; something &quot;over&quot;, to &quot;look forward to&quot; something, and to &quot;look up&quot; something in a dictionary (contrast the literal and non-compound &quot;look up the chimney&quot;).

A dictionary comparison reveals that compound verbs of some sorts are more frequent in American English than in British English.

===Hindi-Urdu===
Compound verbs are very common in Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindustani and Panjabi, where as many as 20% of the verb forms in running text may be compounds.

For example, in Hindi-Urdu, &quot;nikal gayā (निकल गया, نِکَل گَیا&quot;, lit. &quot;exit went&quot;) means &#x27;went out&#x27;, while &quot;nikal paṛā&quot; (निकल पड़ा, نِکَل پَڑا, lit. &quot;exit fell&quot;) means &#x27;departed&#x27; or &#x27;was blurted out&#x27;. In these examples &quot;nikal&quot; (निकल, نِکَل, lit. &quot;exit&quot;) is the primary verb, and &quot;gayā&quot; (गया, گَیا, lit. &quot;went&quot;) and &quot;paṛā&quot; (पड़ा, پَڑا, lit. &quot;fell&quot;) are the vectors or &quot;light verbs&quot;. Compound verbs in Hindi-Urdu have the additional property of alternation. That is, under partly specifiable conditions [such as negation] compound verbs like &quot;nikal gayā&quot; and &quot;nikal paṛā&quot; are replaced with a non-compound counterpart [&quot;niklā, निकला, نِکلا&quot; ] with little or no change in meaning. However, the phenomenon of alternation is not found in all languages that have compound verbs.

The Noun + Verb complex predicates are a quite different matter. There is no alternation with a simplex counterpart and in approximately half of all Hind-Urdui N+V compound verbs &quot;karnā&quot; ( करना, کَرنا, lit. &quot;to do&quot;) is the light verb, and in another 20% use &quot;hōnā&quot; (होना, ہونا, lit. &quot;to be&quot;) is the light verb. A significant number use &quot;khānā&quot; (खाना, کهانا, lit. &quot;to eat&quot;). However, the verb &quot;karnā&quot; and &quot;khān&quot;ā never occur as second elements in a Verb + Verb compound.

===Persian===
Persian makes extensive use of N+V compound verbs. The meaning of compound verbs in Persian is sometimes distinct from the connotation of either the verbal or non-verbal component. The most common verbal element used in Persian compound verbs is كردن &quot;kardan&quot; (&#x27;to do/make&#x27;), e.g. فكر كردن &quot;fekr kardan&quot; (&#x27;to think&#x27;). Other common verbal elements include دادن &quot;dādan&quot; (&#x27;to give&#x27;), e.g. انجام دادن &quot;anjām dādan&quot; (&#x27;to perform&#x27;); گرفتن &quot;gereftan&quot; (&#x27;to take&#x27;), e.g. جشن گرفتن &quot;jashn gereftan&quot; (&#x27;to celebrate&#x27;); زدن &quot;zadan&quot; (&#x27;to hit&#x27;), e.g. حرف زدن &quot;harf zadan&quot; (&#x27;to speak&#x27;); and داشتن &quot;dāshtan&quot; (&#x27;to have&#x27;), e.g. دوست داشتن &quot;dust dāshtan&quot; (&#x27;to like&#x27;).

The verbal element of Persian compound verbs takes inflection for person, tense, and mood.

===Japanese===

Japanese has many compound verbs, reflecting the agglutinative nature of modern as well as Old Japanese.

In both English &quot;start reading&quot; and Japanese &quot;yomihajimeru&quot; &quot;read--start&quot; &quot;start reading,&quot; the phrasal verbs &quot;start&quot; and &quot;hajimeru&quot; &quot;start&quot; change according to tense, negation, and the like while the main verbs &quot;reading&quot; and &quot;yomi&quot; &quot;reading&quot; usually remain the same. An exception to this is the passive voice, in which both English and Japanese modify the main verb: &quot;start to be read&quot; and &quot;yomarehajimeru&quot; lit. &quot;read--start&quot; &quot;start to be read&quot;. Of course, &quot;hajimeru&quot; still changes according to tense, mood, negation, and the like.

Some Japanese compounds have undergone grammaticalisation, as reflected in the orthography. Many Japanese serial verbs are formed by connecting two verbs, as in , and in Japanese orthography lexical items are generally written with kanji (here and ), while grammatical items are more likely to be written with hiragana [as in the compound verb . Serial verbs are thus generally written with a kanji for each constituent verb, but some of the second verbs in other compounds, having become grammaticalized, are often written using hiragana, such as , from , as in and , from , as in .

Only native Japanese verbs (&quot;yamatokotoba&quot; verbs) can be used as light verbs or vectors in this way. Such verbs comprise a small closed class. Borrowed words, which can be used as verbs by combining them with the auxiliary verb , do not occur as the second element in compound verbs. For example, the Sino-Japanese verb itself can be modified, as in , but it does not combine with another verb as its second or modifying element.

Japanese &quot;i&quot;-adjectives, which function grammatically as non-finite verbs, can also compound, functioning as compound modifiers, but that is less common than for verbs. (See Japanese adjectives for details.)

===Kichwa-influenced Spanish===
Under the influence of a Kichwa substrate, speakers living in the Ecuadorian Altiplano have innovated compound verbs in Spanish.


In conformity with the SVO language word order of Spanish, the vector precedes the main verb while in SOV language Kichwa, the vector follows the main verb.

===Greek (modern)===
The compound verbs of modern Greek are formed as other compounds in the language, creating a compound stem by prefixing the stem of a second verb to another verb with the compounding interfix -o-. Although only the second verb is inflected, the typical Greek compound verb is a coordinative compound formed by two semantically opposed, equal verbs, and in semantic terms neither can be nominated the compound head with the other as a dependent. The action expressed by the verb is semantically equal to using both verbs individually, linked by a conjunction.
Examples: [] &#x27;I go in&#x27; + [] &#x27;I come out&#x27; = [] &#x27;I go in and out&#x27;; [] &#x27;I light up&#x27; [&#x27;] &#x27;I put out (a light)&#x27; = [] &#x27;I flash on and off&#x27;. These compound verbs are of the dvandva type. Semantically they equal the phrases &#x27;I go in and go out&#x27;, &#x27;I light up and put out&#x27;.

===Israeli Hebrew===

Unlike Classical Hebrew, Israeli Hebrew is abundant with V+N compound verbs. Consider the following pairs in which the first is an Israeli Hebrew compound verb and the last is a Classical Hebrew synthetic form: 

# שם צעקה &quot;sam tseaká&quot; “shouted” (which literally means “put a shout”) vis-à-vis צעק &quot;tsaák&quot; “shouted” 
# נתן מבט &quot;natán mabát&quot; “looked” (which literally means “gave a look”) or העיף מבט &quot;heíf mabát&quot; “looked” (literally “flew/threw a look”; cf. the English expressions &quot;cast a glance&quot;, &quot;threw a look&quot; and &quot;tossed a glance&quot;) vis-à-vis the Hebrew-descent הביט &quot;hibít&quot; “looked at”. 

According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, the Israeli V+N compound verb is employed here for the desire to express swift action, and stems from Yiddish. He compares the Israeli periphrasis to the following Yiddish expressions all meaning “to have a look”: 

# געבן א קוק &quot;gebn a kuk&quot;, which literally means “to give a look”
# טאן א קוק &quot;ton a kuk&quot;, which literally means “to do a look” 
# the colloquial expression כאפן א קוק &quot;khapn a kuk&quot;, which literally means “to catch a look”. 

Zuckermann argues that the Israeli V+N compound verbs “are not nonce, ad hoc lexical calques of Yiddish. The Israeli system is productive and the lexical realization often differs from that of Yiddish”. He provides the following Israeli examples: 

# הרביץ &quot;hirbíts&quot; “hit, beat; gave”, yielded
## הרביץ מהירות &quot;hirbíts mehirút&quot; “drove very fast” (מהירות &quot;mehirút&quot; meaning “speed”), and 
## הרביץ ארוחה &quot;hirbíts arukhá&quot; “ate a big meal” (ארוחה &quot;arukhá&quot; meaning “meal”), cf. English &quot;hit the buffet&quot; “eat a lot at the buffet”; &quot;hit the liquor/bottle&quot; “drink alcohol”. 

The Israeli Hebrew compound verb דפק הופעה &quot;dafák hofaá&quot;, which literally means “hit a show”, actually means “dressed smartly”.

==Historical processes and grammaticalization==
As languages change, the vector or light verb may retain its original meaning or it may undergo different degrees of &quot;bleaching&quot;, part of the process of grammaticalization.

Thus, in the Hindi-Urdu compound &quot;nikal paṛā&quot; (exit fell), &quot;paṛ-&quot; has almost none of its &quot;fall&quot; meaning, though some of the finality of &quot;fall&quot; also is transferred as a perfective aspect (through the ending &quot;-ā&quot;).

On the other hand, the Japanese retains a good deal of its independent word meaning even in the compound. Contrast this with the grammaticalization of , as in 愛してしまった ai shite shimatta (&quot;I mistakenly fell in love&quot;). A deeper degree of grammaticalization may lead to phonological changes, too - usually some kind of shortening: 愛しちゃった ai shi chatta (&quot;Damned if I didn&#x27;t fall in love!&quot;) where 〜てしま -te shima- has been replaced by ちゃ 〜chya.

In the long run, it has been suggested that LVs that are particularly frequent, may become grammaticalized, so that they may now occur systematically with other verbal constituents, so that they become
an auxiliary verb (e.g. the English verb &quot;be&quot;, as in &quot;I am eating&quot;, or &quot;had&quot; in &quot;they had finished&quot;), or, after sound change, even a clitic (a shortened verb, as in &quot;I&#x27;m&quot;). In particular, some verb inflections (e.g. Latin future tense inflections) are thought to have arisen in this manner. Sanford Steever has shown the same phenomenon has a role in the emergence of the ditransitive paradigm in Dravidian.

<text>Interiors is a 1978 American drama film written and directed by Woody Allen. It stars Kristin Griffith, Mary Beth Hurt, Richard Jordan, Diane Keaton, E. G. Marshall, Geraldine Page, Maureen Stapleton, and Sam Waterston.

Allen&#x27;s first full-fledged film in the drama genre, it was met with acclaim from critics. It received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Director, Best Original Screenplay (both for Allen), Best Actress (Page), and Best Supporting Actress (Stapleton). Page also won the BAFTA Film Award for Best Supporting Actress.

== Plot ==
Arthur, a corporate attorney, and Eve, an interior decorator, are the parents of three adult daughters. Renata, the eldest daughter, is a poet whose husband Frederick, a struggling writer, feels eclipsed by her success. Flyn, the youngest daughter, is an actress who is away most of the time filming; the low quality of her films is an object of ridicule behind her back. The middle daughter, Joey, who is in a relationship with Mike, cannot settle on a career, and resents her mother for favoring Renata, while Renata resents their father&#x27;s concern over Joey&#x27;s lack of direction.

One morning, Arthur unexpectedly announces that he wants a separation from his wife and would like to live alone. Eve, who is clinically depressed, attempts suicide in her new Manhattan apartment. The shock of these two events causes a rift among the sisters. Arthur returns from a trip to Greece with Pearl, a high-spirited and more &quot;normal&quot; woman, whom he intends to marry. His daughters are disturbed that Arthur would disregard Eve&#x27;s suicide attempt and find another woman, to whom Joey refers as a &quot;vulgarian&quot;.

Arthur and Pearl marry at the family&#x27;s Long Island beach house, with Renata, Joey, and Flyn in attendance. Later in the evening, Joey lashes out at Pearl when Pearl accidentally breaks one of Eve&#x27;s vases. In the middle of the night, Frederick drunkenly attempts to rape Flyn in the garage, but she manages to escape. Meanwhile, Joey finds Eve in the house, and sadly explains how much she has given up for her mother, and how disdainfully she is treated. Eve walks out onto the beach and into the surf. Joey unsuccessfully attempts to save Eve, but nearly drowns in the process. Mike rescues Joey, pulling her to shore, so that Pearl resuscitates the drowned victim by tilting Joey&#x27;s head back, clearing the airway, and pinching the nose, to administer rescue breaths into her lungs via mouth-to-mouth.

The family attends Eve&#x27;s funeral, each placing a single white rose, Eve&#x27;s favorite flower and a symbol of hope to her, on Eve&#x27;s wooden coffin, after which the three sisters look out at the sea from their former family beach house and comment on the peacefulness of the sea.

== Cast ==
== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Interiors&quot; grossed $10.4 million in the United States and Canada.

=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 78% based 18 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;beautiful&quot; and complimented Gordon Willis on his &quot;use of cool colors that suggest civilization&#x27;s precarious control of natural forces&quot;, but noted:
Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s &quot;desperate sobriety ... robs it of energy and passion&quot;; Allen&#x27;s &quot;style is Bergmanesque, but his material is Mankiewiczian, and the discontinuity is fatal. Doubtless this was a necessary movie for Allen, but it is both unnecessary and a minor embarrassment for his well-wishers.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and praised it highly, writing, &quot;Here we have a Woody Allen film, and we&#x27;re talking about O&#x27;Neill and Bergman and traditions and influences? Yes, and correctly. Allen, whose comedies have been among the cheerful tonics of recent years, is astonishingly assured in his first drama.&quot;

Gene Siskel awarded three stars out of four and wrote:
Charles Champlin called the film &quot;somber, intense and stunning&quot;, concluding, &quot;Like &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;, Allen&#x27;s &quot;Interiors&quot; is, for all the somberness of the material, in the end an affirmation of life and a transcendent piece of art. The film lovers will love it if joke-seekers do not.

Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: &quot;This droll piece of work is [Allen&#x27;s] most majestic so far. The theme its characters express is very Chekhovian. It is pinned to the idea that the hardest, and most admirable thing to do is to act properly through a whole life.&quot;

James Monaco, in his 1979 book &quot;American Film Now&quot;, described &quot;Interiors&quot; as &quot;the most pretentious film by a major American filmmaker in the last thirty years&quot; alongside &quot;Mickey One&quot; (1965).

In 2016, &quot;Interiors&quot; was listed as Allen&#x27;s 11th best film in an article by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey, who wrote that &quot;the emotional effort being expended is cumulatively hard to shrug off&quot; and praised Stapleton&#x27;s performance.

=== Woody Allen&#x27;s response ===
Allen&#x27;s own fears about the film&#x27;s reception are recounted in a 1991 biography of Allen by Eric Lax, where he quotes Ralph Rosenblum, the film&#x27;s editor:
Later, while watching the film with an acquaintance, Allen reportedly said, &quot;It&#x27;s always been my fear. I think I&#x27;m writing &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; and it turns into &quot;Edge of Night&quot;.&quot;

Looking back on the film in 1982, Allen said:

The variable contained a 1024-bit public key; such keys are used in public-key cryptography for encryption (but not decryption). Because of the name, however, it was speculated that the key would allow the United States National Security Agency (NSA) to subvert any Windows user&#x27;s security. Microsoft denied the speculation and said that the key&#x27;s name came from the fact that NSA was the technical review authority for U.S. cryptography export controls.

== Overview ==

Microsoft requires all cryptography suites that interoperate with Microsoft Windows to have an RSA digital signature. Since only Microsoft-approved cryptography suites can be shipped with Windows, it is possible to keep export copies of this operating system in compliance with the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which are enforced by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).

It was already known that Microsoft used two keys, a primary and a spare, either of which can create valid signatures. Upon releasing the Service Pack 5 for Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft had neglected to remove the debugging symbols in ADVAPI32.DLL, a library that exposes such Windows features as Windows Registry and security. Andrew Fernandes, chief scientist with Cryptonym, found the primary key stored in the variable and the second key was labeled . Fernandes published his discovery, touching off a flurry of speculation and conspiracy theories, including the possibility that the second key enabled the United States National Security Agency (NSA) to subvert any Windows user&#x27;s security.

During a presentation at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy 2000 (CFP2000) conference, Duncan Campbell, senior research fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), mentioned the controversy as an example of an outstanding issue related to security and surveillance.

In addition, Dr. Nicko van Someren found a third key in Windows 2000, which he doubted had a legitimate purpose, and declared that &quot;It looks more fishy&quot;.

== Microsoft&#x27;s reaction ==

Microsoft denied the backdoor speculations on and said &quot;This speculation is ironic since Microsoft has consistently opposed the various key escrow proposals suggested by the government.&quot; According to Microsoft, the key&#x27;s symbol was &quot;&quot; because the NSA was the review authority for U.S. cryptography export controls.

Richard Purcell, Microsoft&#x27;s Director of Corporate Privacy, approached Campbell after his presentation and expressed a wish to clear up the confusion and doubts about . Immediately after the conference, Scott Culp, of the Microsoft Security Response Center, contacted Campbell and offered to answer his questions. Their correspondence began cordially but soon became strained; Campbell apparently felt Culp was being evasive and Culp apparently felt that Campbell was hostilely repeating questions that he had already answered. On 28 April 2000, Culp stated that &quot;we have definitely reached the end of this discussion ... [which] is rapidly spiraling into the realm of conspiracy theory&quot;.

Microsoft claimed the third key was only in beta builds of Windows 2000 and that its purpose was for signing Cryptographic Service Providers.

=== Further technical information ===

The Mozilla page on common questions on cryptography describes how Microsoft signs CSPs:

It is in fact possible under certain circumstances to obtain an export license for software invoking cryptographic functions through an API. For example, Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of the Microsoft Cryptographic API (CryptoAPI) specification was approved for export from the US, even though it implements an API by which third parties, including third parties outside the US, can add separate modules (&quot;Cryptographic Service Providers&quot; or CSPs) implementing cryptographic functionality. This export approval was presumably made possible because a) the CryptoAPI implementation requires third party CSPs to be digitally signed by Microsoft and rejects attempts to call CSPs not so signed; b) through this signing process Microsoft can ensure compliance with the relevant US export control regulations (e.g., they presumably would not sign a CSP developed outside the US that implements strong cryptography); and c) Microsoft&#x27;s CryptoAPI implementation is available only in executable form, and thus is presumed to be reasonably resistant to user tampering to disable the CSP digital signature check.
According to Fernandes, it is possible to replace . When loading a cryptographic module, the function first tries using to verify the module, then . Since no cryptographic modules in Windows are signed with , it never gets used. Replacing it with a different key allows non-US companies to install their crypto services into Windows without Microsoft&#x27;s or the NSA&#x27;s approval.

=== Further speculation ===

Microsoft stated that the second key is present as a backup to guard against the possibility of losing the primary secret key. Fernandes doubts this explanation, pointing out that the generally accepted way to guard against loss of a secret key is secret splitting, which would divide the key into several different parts, which would then be distributed throughout senior management. He stated that this would be far more robust than using two keys; if the second key is also lost, Microsoft would need to patch or upgrade every copy of Windows in the world, as well as every cryptographic module it had ever signed.

On the other hand, if Microsoft failed to think about the consequences of key loss and created a first key without using secret splitting (and did so in secure hardware which doesn&#x27;t allow protection to be weakened after key generation), and the NSA pointed out this problem as part of the review process, it might explain why Microsoft weakened their scheme with a second key and why the new one was called . (The second key might be backed up using secret splitting, so losing both keys should not be a problem.) Another possibility is that Microsoft included a second key to be able to sign cryptographic modules outside the United States, while still complying with the BIS&#x27;s EAR. If cryptographic modules were to be signed in multiple locations, using multiple keys is a reasonable approach. However, no cryptographic module has ever been found to be signed by , and Microsoft denies that any other certification authority exists.

Bruce Schneier believes that the above type of concern, i.e. NSA putting a key in Windows so it can load arbitrary backdoored CSPs, is unfounded. He argues that there are easier ways of backdooring Windows that do not involve using an additional key, let alone one called &quot;NSAKEY&quot; in debug symbols visible to the whole company: the NSA could just ask for the main key. The crypto API is also a poor point of entry, as it requires the victim to run an NSA-supplied executable.

== Key values ==

Both keys are RSA keys with an &quot;e&quot; equal to 65537, which is a standard choice.

_KEY has an &quot;n&quot; of:
_NSAKEY has an &quot;n&quot; of:
== PGP keys ==

In September 1999, an anonymous researcher reverse-engineered both the primary key and the _NSAKEY into PGP-compatible format and published them to key servers.

<text>Sally Margaret Field (born November 6, 1946) is an American actress. Known for her extensive work on screen and stage, she has received many accolades throughout her career spanning six decades, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and three Primetime Emmy Awards, in addition to nominations for a Tony Award and two British Academy Film Awards. She was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014, the National Medal of Arts in 2014, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2019, and the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2023.

Field began her career on television, starring in the comedies &quot;Gidget&quot; (1965–1966), &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; (1967–1970), and &quot;The Girl with Something Extra&quot; (1973–1974). She received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for the NBC television film &quot;Sybil&quot; (1976). Her film debut was as an extra in &quot;Moon Pilot&quot; (1962) followed by starring roles in &quot;The Way West&quot; (1967), &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; (1976), &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977), &quot;Heroes&quot; (1977), &quot;The End&quot; (1978), and &quot;Hooper&quot; (1978). She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress for &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979), and &quot;Places in the Heart&quot; (1984). Other notable roles include in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; (1980), &quot;Absence of Malice&quot; (1981), &quot;Kiss Me Goodbye&quot; (1982), &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1985), &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989), &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991), &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993), and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994).

In the 2000s, Field returned to television with a recurring role on the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in 2001. For her role of Nora Walker in the ABC drama series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; (2006–2011), Field won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She portrayed Mary Todd Lincoln in &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), for which she received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. She portrayed Aunt May in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012) and its 2014 sequel. Other roles include in the films &quot;Hello, My Name Is Doris&quot; (2015), and &quot;80 for Brady&quot; (2023), as well as in the Netflix limited series &quot;Maniac&quot; (2018).

She made her professional stage debut replacing Mercedes Ruehl in the original Broadway production of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?&quot; in 2002. Field returned to the stage after an absence of 15 years with the 2017 revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Menagerie,&quot; for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She made her debut on the West End theatre in the revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot; in 2019.

==Early life==
Sally Field was born on November 6, 1946, in Pasadena, California, to actress Margaret Field (née Morlan) (1922-2011) and pharmacist Richard Dryden Field (1914-1993), who served in the Army during World War II. Her brother is Richard Dryden Field Jr., a physicist and academic. Her parents were divorced in 1950; on January 21, 1952, in Tijuana, Mexico, her mother married Jock Mahoney, an actor and stuntman. Field said in her 2018 memoir that she was sexually abused by Mahoney during her childhood.

As a teen, Field attended Portola Middle School and Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, where she was a cheerleader. Her class of 1964 classmates included financier Michael Milken and talent agent Michael Ovitz, while actress Cindy Williams was a year behind Field.

Field has stated that when she was seventeen she had an illegal abortion in Mexico, and was molested during it.

==Career==
=== 1965–1976 ===

Field got her start on television as the boy-crazy surfer girl in the sitcom &quot;Gidget&quot; (1965–1966). The show was not an initial success and was cancelled after a single season; however, summer reruns garnered respectable ratings, making the show a belated success. Wanting to find a new starring vehicle for Field, ABC next produced &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; with Field cast as Sister Bertrille for three seasons, from 1967 to 1970. In an interview included on the Season One DVD release, Field said that she thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Gidget&quot; but hated &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; because she was not treated with respect by the show&#x27;s directors. Field was then typecast, finding respectable roles difficult to obtain. In 1971, Field starred in the ABC television film &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Come Home in the Spring&quot;, playing a discouraged teen runaway who returns home with a bearded, drug-abusing hippie (played by David Carradine). She made several guest television appearances through the mid-1970s, including a role on the Western &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, a popular series starring &quot;Gidget&quot; co-star Pete Duel. She also appeared in the episode &quot;Whisper&quot; on the thriller &quot;Night Gallery&quot;.

In 1973, Field was cast in a starring role opposite John Davidson in the series &quot;The Girl with Something Extra&quot; that aired from 1973 to 1974. Following the series&#x27; cancellation, Field studied at the Actors Studio with acting teacher Lee Strasberg. Strasberg became a mentor to Field, helping her move past her television image of the girl next door. During this period, Field divorced her first husband in 1975.

Soon after studying with Strasberg, Field landed the title role in the 1976 television film &quot;Sybil&quot;, based on the book by Flora Rheta Schreiber. Her dramatic portrayal of a young woman afflicted with dissociative identity disorder earned her an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Special Program – Drama or Comedy in 1977 and enabled her to break through the typecasting of her sitcom work.

===1977–1989===
In 1977, Field co-starred with Burt Reynolds, Jackie Gleason, and Jerry Reed in the year&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film, &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;. In 1979, she played the titular union organizer in &quot;Norma Rae&quot;, a film that established her as a dramatic actress. Vincent Canby, reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;&quot;Norma Rae&quot; is a seriously concerned contemporary drama, illuminated by some very good performances and one, Miss Field&#x27;s, that is spectacular.&quot; For her role in &quot;Norma Rae&quot;, Field won the Best Female Performance Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Field appeared with Reynolds in three more films: &quot;The End&quot;, &quot;Hooper&quot;, and &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;. In 1981, she continued to change her image, playing a foul-mouthed prostitute opposite Tommy Lee Jones in the South-set film &quot;Back Roads&quot;. She was nominated for a Golden Globe for the 1981 drama &quot;Absence of Malice&quot; and the 1982 comedy &quot;Kiss Me Goodbye&quot;.

In the 1984 drama &quot;Places in the Heart&quot;, she starred as Edna Spalding, a farm widow struggling to weather the Great Depression. She won her second Golden Globe Award and second Oscar. Field&#x27;s acceptance speech has since been both admired as earnest and parodied as excessive, mainly the line, &quot;And I can&#x27;t deny the fact that you like me...right now...you like me! (applause) Thank you!&quot; Field later parodied herself when she delivered the line (often misquoted as &quot;You like me, you &quot;really&quot; like me!&quot;) in a Charles Schwab commercial.

In 1985, she co-starred with James Garner in the romantic comedy &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot;. The following year, Field appeared on the cover of the March 1986 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, in which she was the interview subject. She did not appear as a pictorial subject in the magazine, although she did wear the classic leotard and bunny-ears outfit on the cover. That year, she received the Women in Film Crystal Award. For her role as matriarch M&#x27;Lynn in the film version of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989), she was nominated for a 1990 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.

===1990–present===
In the early 1990s, Field had supporting roles in a number of films. These included Disney&#x27;s live-action film &quot;Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey&quot; (1993), where she voiced the role of Sassy. In &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993), she played the wife of Robin Williams&#x27;s character and the love interest of Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s character. She then played Tom Hanks&#x27;s mother in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), even though she was only 10 years older than Hanks, with whom she had co-starred six years earlier in &quot;Punchline&quot;. For Forrest Gump, she received BAFTA and SAG nominations.

Field&#x27;s other 1990s films included &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;, a controversial thriller based on the real-life experience of Betty Mahmoody&#x27;s escape from Iran with her daughter Mahtob; and &quot;Soapdish&quot;, a comedy in which she played a pampered soap-opera star and was joined by a cast that included Kevin Kline, Whoopi Goldberg, Cathy Moriarty, Elisabeth Shue, and Robert Downey Jr. In 1996, Field reprised her role as Sassy in &quot;Homeward Bound 2: Lost in San Francisco&quot; and later that year, she received the Berlinale Camera award at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival for her role as a grieving vigilante mother in director John Schlesinger&#x27;s film &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;. In 1997, Field guest starred on the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Hilloween&quot;, in which she voiced religious woman Junie Harper, who contends with Hank Hill (Mike Judge) to ban Halloween. She co-starred with Natalie Portman in &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; (2000), and appeared opposite Reese Witherspoon in &quot;Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde&quot;.

Field had a recurring role on &quot;ER&quot; in the 2000–2001 season as Dr. Abby Lockhart&#x27;s mother, Maggie, who suffers from bipolar disorder, a role for which she won an Emmy Award in 2001. After her critically acclaimed stint on the show, she returned to the role in 2003 and 2006. She also starred in the 2002 series &quot;The Court&quot;.

Field&#x27;s directorial career began with the television film &quot;The Christmas Tree&quot; (1996). In 1998, she directed the episode &quot;The Original Wives&#x27; Club&quot; of the critically acclaimed TV miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, also playing a minor role as Trudy, the wife of astronaut Gordon Cooper. In 2000, she directed the feature film &quot;Beautiful&quot;.

Field was a late addition to the ABC drama &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, which debuted in September 2006. In the show&#x27;s pilot, the role of matriarch Nora Walker was played by Betty Buckley. However, the show&#x27;s producers decided to take the character in another direction, and offered the part to Field, who won the 2007 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance. The drama also starred Calista Flockhart and Rachel Griffiths as Nora&#x27;s adult daughters. In November 2009, Field appeared on an episode of &quot;The Doctors&quot; to talk about osteoporosis and her Rally With Sally Foundation.

She portrayed Aunt May in the Marvel Comics films &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012) as well as the 2014 sequel. Field&#x27;s widely praised portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;Lincoln&quot;, also in 2012, brought her Best Supporting Actress Award nominations at the Oscars, Golden Globes, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, and Critics&#x27; Choice.

On May 5, 2014, Field received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to motion pictures. Her star is located in front of the Hollywood Wax Museum. In January 2015, it was announced that she would co-host TCM. The same year, Field portrayed the titular character in &quot;Hello, My Name Is Doris&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in a Comedy.

In 2017, Field reprised her role as Amanda Wingfield in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; on Broadway at the Belasco Theatre. Performances began on February 7, 2017, in previews, and officially opened on March 9. The production closed on May 21, 2017, after 85 performance and 31 previews. Field had previously played the role in the Kennedy Center production in 2004. She was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance. Her memoir, &quot;In Pieces&quot;, was published by Grand Central Publishing in September 2018.

Field returned to episodic television in 2018, starring in the Netflix miniseries &quot;Maniac&quot;. Subsequently, in 2020, Field starred in the AMC series &quot;Dispatches from Elsewhere&quot;.

In 2023, Field co-starred in the comedy movie &quot;80 for Brady&quot;, which starred NFL quarterback Tom Brady along with fellow actresses Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Rita Moreno. Also in 2023, Field was named the 58th recipient of the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, which she was presented at the 29th Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Personal life==
Field was married to Steven Craig from 1968 to 1975, though they separated in 1973. The couple had two sons: Peter Craig, a novelist and screenwriter in 1969; and Eli Craig, an actor and director in 1972.

From 1976 to 1980, Field had a relationship with Burt Reynolds, during which time they co-starred in four films: &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, &quot;The End&quot;, and &quot;Hooper&quot;. Following their 1980 breakup, Field and Reynolds continued to date on and off before splitting permanently in 1982.

Field married her second husband, Alan Greisman, in 1984. Together, they had one son, Sam (b. 1987). Field and Greisman divorced in 1994.

On October 29, 1988, at Aspen/Pitkin County Airport in Colorado, Field and three members of her family were in a private plane owned by media mogul Merv Griffin when it lost power and rejected takeoff, slamming into a parked aircraft. They all survived with minor injuries.

==Philanthropy and activism==
In 2005, Field was diagnosed with osteoporosis. Her diagnosis led her to create the &quot;Rally with Sally for Bone Health&quot; campaign with support from Roche and GlaxoSmithKline that controversially co-promoted Boniva, a bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis. Field&#x27;s campaign encouraged the early diagnosis of such conditions through technology such as bone-density scans.

In 2005, Field received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented in recognition of her lifetime of contributions to the arts as well as her dedication as a social activist.

During her acceptance speech at the 2007 Emmy Awards, when she won for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Field said: &quot;If the mothers ruled the world, there would be no goddamn wars in the first place.&quot; Fox Broadcasting Company, which aired the show, cut the sound and picture after the word &quot;god&quot; and did not return camera/sound to the stage until after Field finished talking. An e-mail statement from the company the day after the incident explained that the censorship of Field&#x27;s speech (among two other censorship incidents during the award ceremony) occurred because &quot;some language during the live broadcast may have been considered inappropriate by some viewers. As a result, Fox&#x27;s broadcast standards executives determined it appropriate to drop sound and picture during those portions of the show.&quot;

Field is an advocate for women&#x27;s rights. She has served on the board of directors of Vital Voices Global Partnership, an international women&#x27;s NGO, and has co-hosted the Global Leadership Awards six times. A Democrat, Field supported Hillary Clinton&#x27;s bid for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2008 presidential election, and Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign.

Field is also an advocate for gay rights, and won the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s Ally for Equality Award in 2012. Her youngest son, Samuel Greisman, is gay.

Field was arrested on December 13, 2019, while attending Jane Fonda&#x27;s weekly Friday climate change protests in Washington, D.C.

Having undergone a traumatic illegal abortion in Mexico at the age of seventeen, Field is a vocal advocate for abortion rights in the United States.

<text>Starting Over is a 1979 American comedy-drama film based on Dan Wakefield&#x27;s 1973 novel, written and produced by James L. Brooks, and directed by Alan J. Pakula. Starring Burt Reynolds, Jill Clayburgh, and Candice Bergen, it follows a recently divorced man who is torn between his new girlfriend and his ex-wife.

It was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Clayburgh) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Bergen). Marvin Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager wrote three original songs for the film, &quot;Easy for You,&quot; &quot;Better Than Ever&quot;, and &quot;Starting Over&quot;, which are sung by Bergen live in the film, but sung by Stephanie Mills for the radio versions.

==Plot==
Phil Potter splits with his wife, Jessica. She wants to be a singer/songwriter and has been having an affair.

Phil moves from New York City to Boston, where his brother, Mickey, and his sister-in-law, Marva, live. They set him up with a blind date, Marilyn Holmberg, a nursery-school teacher working on her master&#x27;s degree, but she declines when he asks to see her again.

Phil takes a part-time teaching job and attends a divorced-men workshop in a church basement, meeting men like Paul and Larry whose situations are similar to his. Marilyn tells him it&#x27;s too soon following his breakup for her to consider a relationship with him. He goes on a date with her friend Marie, a single mom but he does not reciprocate her enthusiasm. Later, Marilyn relents and they begin dating.

At a family Thanksgiving dinner at his brother&#x27;s house, Phil takes a phone call from Jessica in the middle of dinner. Marilyn overhears him telling Jessie that he is dining with his family and &quot;their friend&quot;. Hurt, she ends their relationship. Soon after, he confronts Marilyn at a school carnival, where she is staffing a &quot;Dunk the Teacher&quot; dunk tank and, after dunking her several times, Phil asks her to &quot;define&quot; their relationship. Finally, Marilyn agrees when Phil invites her to move in with him.

Soon after they move in together, Phil returns to the apartment to find Marilyn and Jessica, who has unexpectedly turned up. She looks fabulous and has become a success as a songwriter and wants him back.

Phil moves back to New York City to be with Jessica again, but finds he misses Marilyn. He returns to Boston, only to find she is now dating a basketball player. Phil approaches her outside the school at which she works, then at a Boston Celtics practice, where he declares his love for her and she returns to him.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote that it &quot;feels sort of embarrassed at times, maybe because characters are placed in silly sitcom situations and then forced to say lines that are supposed to be revealing and real.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and said it was worth seeing because &quot;Two-thirds of it (Reynolds and Clayburgh) work very well,&quot; though he disliked Candice Bergen, saying &quot;she is awful in this picture&quot; and that the script &quot;somehow feels obliged to be cute or funny. We don&#x27;t want jokes from &#x27;Starting Over.&#x27; All we want is to see Reynolds and Clayburgh go out together and work on their problems.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a delight. Much more than the flip side of &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;, to which it will inevitably be compared, the James L. Brook (sic) production takes on the subject of marital dissolution from a comic point of view, and succeeds admirably.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared, &quot;It is, all in all, a classy entertainment which, right now and in years to come, will remind us quite accurately how things were between middle-class men and women, circa 1980.&quot; Jack Kroll of &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated that the film &quot;starts out well and continues well for about two-thirds of the way before succumbing to the creeping virus of the cutesies. But until then, Pakula finds a nice groove of effectively understated comedy.&quot; Frank Rich said in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Though this film has funny lines and a potentially explosive story, it rarely generates any emotion beyond bland good cheer. Right up to the moment that &quot;Starting Over&quot; is over, we are still waiting for the fireworks to start.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;As the newly divorced hero of &#x27;Starting Over,&#x27; a delightful romantic comedy destined for enormous well-deserved popularity, Burt Reynolds reaches a breathtaking new plateau of screen acting dexterity.&quot;

<text>Chapter Two is a semi-autobiographical play by Neil Simon. The play premiered on Broadway in 1977, where it ran for 857 performances.

==History==
According to Sheridan Morley, &quot;This was in some ways the turning-point for Simon, the moment when he started to use his own life as something more than an excuse for a gag-fest. It was written as a tribute to Marsha Mason, his second wife, and her tolerance with his long-lasting grief over the death of his first wife...There is something very painful here, in among the gags, about a man trying to come to terms with death rather than a new life.&quot;

==Overview==
The play focuses on a recently widowed writer, George Schneider, who is introduced by his press agent brother to soap opera actress Jennie Malone. Jennie&#x27;s marriage to a football player has dissolved after six years. Both are uncertain of their readiness to start dating and developing a new romance when her breakup is so recent and he still has recurring memories of his deceased wife, Barbara.

Neil Simon&#x27;s first wife, Joan Baim, died in 1973.

==Productions==
===Stage===
The play had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Ahmanson Theatre on October 7, 1977, closing November 26. Produced by Emanuel Azenberg and directed by Herbert Ross, the cast included: Judd Hirsch as George, Anita Gillette as Jennie, Cliff Gorman as Leo, and Ann Wedgeworth as Faye. The production won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards (1977–78): Distinguished Production; and Neil Simon, Distinguished Playwriting.

The play opened on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on December 4, 1977, and transferred to the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre in January 1979, where it closed on December 8, 1979 after 857 performances and seven previews. The Los Angeles cast reprised their roles on Broadway. Cast replacements included David Groh, Dick Latessa, Laurence Luckinbill, Robin Strasser, and Susan Browning.

The play received four 1978 Tony Award nominations: Tony Award for Best Play; Anita Gillette for Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play and Cliff Gorman for Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Ann Wedgeworth won the 1978 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play.

The play premiered in the West End at the Gielgud Theatre in February 1996, with Tom Conti and Sharon Gless. Gless later recorded a two-disc audiobook of the play with David Dukes for LA TheatreWorks.

===Television===
A portion of the &quot;Chapter Two&quot; 1977 play and &quot;Chapter Two&quot; (1979 movie) were used in the plot of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;″s third season&#x27;s episode: &quot;The Letter, Season 3, Episode 20&quot;.

===Film===

Simon adapted the play for the 1979 film version &quot;Chapter Two&quot;. It was directed by Robert Moore with James Caan and Simon&#x27;s then-wife Marsha Mason, the inspiration for character Jennie. Caan said he made the film to earn some money while preparing for &quot;Hide in Plain Sight&quot;.

<text>The Rose is a 1979 American musical drama film directed by Mark Rydell, and starring Bette Midler, Alan Bates, Frederic Forrest, Harry Dean Stanton, Barry Primus, and David Keith. Loosely based on the life of Janis Joplin, the film follows a self-destructive rock star in the late 1960s, who struggles to cope with the pressures of her career and the demands of her ruthless business manager.

Originally titled &quot;Pearl&quot; (Janis Joplin&#x27;s nickname and the title of her last album), the film&#x27;s screenplay was revised and fictionalized after the Joplin family declined to allow producers the rights to her story.

&quot;The Rose&quot; was nominated for four Academy Awards at the 52nd Academy Awards (1980), including Best Actress in a Leading Role (Bette Midler, in her screen debut), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Frederic Forrest), Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Midler performed the soundtrack album for the film, and its title track became one of her biggest hit singles.

==Plot==
In late 1969, Mary Rose Foster is a famous rock and roll diva known as &quot;The Rose.&quot; In spite of her success, her personal life is lonely and exhausting. She is exploited and overworked by her gruff, greedy manager and promoter Rudge Campbell. Though forthright and brassy, Rose is an insecure alcoholic and former drug user who seems to crave approval in her life. As such, she is determined to return to her Florida hometown, now as a superstar, and perform for the people from her past.

Following a performance in New York City, Rose meets with country music star Billy Ray on Long Island, whom she idolizes and whose songs she often covers in live shows. Billy Ray cruelly demands that she never perform his music again and rudely dismisses her. After discovering that Rudge arranged the meeting because he wants to sign Billy Ray to his label, Rose defiantly flees with a limousine driver named Huston Dyer. The two return to New York, where Rose is scheduled to complete recording sessions. They begin a whirlwind romance.

Rudge assumes that Huston is just another hanger-on, but Rose feels she has finally met her true love. Huston eventually admits to her that he is actually an AWOL sergeant from the Army, and she tells him of her past in Florida. The couple&#x27;s relationship grows turbulent amidst Rose&#x27;s reckless lifestyle and constant touring. In Memphis, Rose is met by Sarah, a former lover of hers. When Huston walks in on the two women kissing, he and Rose get into a violent fight, after which Huston flees.

Determined to reunite with Huston, Rose searches for him in a red light district of Memphis with PFC Mal, a military member whom she met in Texas. She subsequently appoints Mal as her security escort, and the two travel to Rose&#x27;s hometown Jacksonville, where Rudge has booked her a hometown reunion show. Upon arriving, Rose shows Mal her childhood home, her high school and other local landmarks from her childhood. Arriving at the stadium for afternoon rehearsals, Rose repeats her intention to take a one-year break from performing, leading Rudge to tell her she will be in breach of contract. Rudge proceeds to fire her, though unbeknownst to Rose, this is only a ploy to ensure that she performs the show. A distraught Rose is met by Huston, who has traveled to Jacksonville to reunite with her.

Believing her concert is cancelled, Rose decides to run away and start a new life with Huston. That night, she takes Huston on a tour of local bars and clubs she used to frequent prior to becoming famous, recklessly drinking and indulging in barbiturates and heroin. At one bar, Huston becomes jealous when a male patron harasses Rose as she performs, and he begins a fight. After, Rudge reaches Rose on her car phone and convinces her to return for the concert. She acquiesces, and her decision to appease Rudge causes Huston to give up on the relationship and leave town. Later that night, after performing the opening song of her long-awaited homecoming concert, Rose collapses onstage and dies of an overdose.

The movie ends with a closing scene of Rose&#x27;s parents and Mal at a garage, following a member of the press who is following Rose&#x27;s tragic death. After taking pictures from Rose as a kid, and some clips she gathered from Billy Ray, Mal turns the lights off as they leave and the garage, along with Rose&#x27;s memories and photographs, goes dark.

<doc id="240370" wikidata="Q1199639" url="?curid=240370" title="Resurrection (1980 film)">
<text>Resurrection is a 1980 American drama film directed by Daniel Petrie, written by Lewis John Carlino, and starring Ellen Burstyn, Sam Shepard, Richard Farnsworth, Roberts Blossom, Lois Smith, and Eva Le Gallienne. It was produced by Renée Missel and Howard Rosenman. The plot involves a woman who returns to life after dying momentarily in a car crash and finds that she has the power to heal people.

At the 53rd Academy Awards, &quot;Resurrection&quot; earned Burstyn and Le Gallienne nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively, while Burstyn received a nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama at the 38th Golden Globe Awards. At the National Board of Review Awards 1980, Le Gallienne won Best Supporting Actress, while the film was selected as one of the top ten films of 1980.

==Plot==
Edna Mae McCauley survives a car accident that kills her husband and nearly kills her, but her brief out of body experience gives her the power to heal people. Paralyzed from the waist down, Edna returns with her father to her small hometown in Kansas to recuperate and be cared for by family. On their way, they stop at &quot;Last Chance Gas,&quot; run by the friendly and eccentric Esco Brown. Welcomed home by family, Edna unwittingly heals a little girl at a party with chronic nosebleeds, to the bewilderment of those around her. Edna&#x27;s grandmother tells her of a woman she knew who had briefly died from pneumonia and returned to life; this woman experienced the same visions as Edna when her spirit left her body, and when she returned to life she too had the power to heal people. Edna eventually heals herself and slowly begins to walk again. She becomes an unwitting celebrity, the hope of those in desperate need of healing, and a lightning rod for religious beliefs and skeptics.

When Edna heals Cal Carpenter, a local farmer, from a stab wound he sustained in a fight, he begins to court her, and the two eventually begin a romantic relationship. As their relationship blossoms, Edna begins to heal her own psychological wounds, coming to peace with the death of her husband and working to understand her new fate. However, Cal believes that Edna&#x27;s mystical abilities are a sign of God&#x27;s will, and he refuses to accept her belief that her powers simply come from deep love and understanding, and he slowly becomes unstable. After two psychologists witness one of Edna&#x27;s healings, they ask her if she would be willing to undergo some tests. She and Cal accompany them to California, where Edna heals a woman with dystonia. Believing this to be too much power, Cal confronts Edna and demands she proclaims herself as Christ resurrected, which she refuses. Cal eventually attempts to assassinate Edna during one of her healing gatherings by shooting her, but he misses, just grazing her shoulder. After Cal is incarcerated, Edna decides to leave her hometown.

Several years pass, and we see a much older Edna now running Esco&#x27;s gas station. A young couple with an adolescent son who is dying of cancer are traveling to see relatives when they stop for gas. Edna suggests the mother and father look at her desert flower collection while she and the son have a talk, and she heals the son before they continue on their way.

==Production==
It was announced in 1976 that writer Stephen Geller had penned a supernatural thriller screenplay under the working title &quot;The Resurrection&quot;, based on an idea by producers Renée Missel and Howard Rosenman. The script would later be reworked by writer Lewis John Carlino, and Geller did not remain with the project and did not receive onscreen credit. Carlino worked closely with actress Ellen Burstyn, and they observed healing centers together. Carlino was able to weave many of Burstyn&#x27;s beliefs and philosophy about healing into her character. Filming took place on location in Texas, and principal photography was completed in 1979.

==Release==
&quot;Resurrection&quot; opened in 420 theaters across the U.S. on September 26, 1980, before expanding further on November 7, 1980. The film eventually grossed $3,910,019, against a budget of $6 million, making it a box office disappointment.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Resurrection&quot; was acclaimed by critics, and currently holds an 83% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on six reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. AllMovie gave the film 4-stars-out-of-5 and called it &quot;an affecting film with a brilliant performance by Ellen Burstyn,&quot; observing &quot;very much an actor-driven film, this deliberately unflashy treatment of an emotionally charged subject is all the more persuasive for its style.&quot;

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film a highly enthusiastic review on their weekly TV show &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, with both critics praising Burstyn&#x27;s performance and the handling of the subject matter. In his annual movie guide, Leonard Maltin rated the film 3-stars-out-of-4, and noted the story as &quot;beautifully realized,&quot; while praising Burstyn&#x27;s &quot;moving performance&quot; as the &quot;centerpiece of a wonderful and underrated film.&quot;

Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of &quot;Spirituality &amp; Practice&quot; wrote very positively of the film: &quot;&quot;Resurrection&quot; is a very timely film in that it deals with health, sickness, healers (religious and non-religious), and the interest science has in this whole phenomenon. On a purely emotional level, this movie forces viewers to come to terms with their feelings about death, love, community, spirituality, and self-repair. Thanks to a stirring and remarkable performance by Ellen Burstyn, &quot;Resurrection&quot; lingers in the mind and heart long after the closing credits.

In a positive review of the film, &quot;film-authority.com&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;Resurrection&quot; is a well-mounted and acted film, but the point is hard to nail down to one specific meaning. Is Edna a messiah, does she actually have supernatural powers? Or is this all an operating table dream a la Jacob&#x27;s Ladder? Anyone&#x27;s guess is good; this is an opaque film that it&#x27;s possible to read almost anything into, and yet the timeline is straight as a die; perhaps mixing up the events might have added an extra layer of engagement for the audience to try to piece things together? Either way, this is a genuine curio, a thoughtful film about healing that never quite explains itself, right to an ingenious ending, but is all the better for leaving plenty of room for interpretation according to your own beliefs.

Janet Maslin of &quot;the New York Times&quot; wrote very positively of the film: &quot;&quot;Resurrection&quot; is a movie about faith, and one that must be taken on faith. It&#x27;s a little bit mad. But it has the courage of its conviction, and a beauty and persuasiveness that help keep the doubts at bay. Miss Burstyn gives the kind of performance that makes all the odd events in the screenplay seem perfectly plausible, perfectly sane. Her presence is radiant, and so steadying it lets the movie exert a tremendous emotional pull. The whole cast is outstanding.&quot; Maslin also singled out Paul Sylbert&#x27;s production design as &quot;particularly memorable&quot;, stating: &quot;&quot;Resurrection&quot; is a handsome movie, with flat Southwestern and Middle Western scenery, and a lot of sky - not to mention the occasional cinematic trip to the Great Beyond. Mr. Petrie achieves a feeling of intimacy right in the middle of those wide-open spaces, without losing a sense of their grandeur. That&#x27;s a worthy accomplishment.&quot;

===Accolades===

<doc id="240371" wikidata="Q83649" url="?curid=240371" title="Private Benjamin (1980 film)">
<text>Private Benjamin is a 1980 American comedy film directed by Howard Zieff, written by Nancy Meyers, Charles Shyer, and Harvey Miller, and starring Goldie Hawn, Eileen Brennan, and Armand Assante.

The film was one of the biggest box office hits of 1980, and also spawned a short-lived television series starring Lorna Patterson as Judy Benjamin, with Brennan reprising her role as Captain Lewis. &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; ranked No. 82 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list, and No. 59 on Bravo&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;.

==Plot==
Judy Benjamin, a 28-year-old Jewish woman from a sheltered wealthy upbringing whose lifelong dream is to &quot;marry a professional man&quot;, is devastated after Yale Goodman, her new husband, dies on their wedding night. Emotionally adrift, Judy tells her story on a radio call-in show and meets another caller, Army recruiter SFC James Ballard, who leads her to believe military life will provide the &quot;family&quot; she seeks. He also pitches the service as a getaway, comparing it to a spa vacation, but Judy has a rude awakening upon arriving at basic training; realizing the recruiter conned her, she wants to quit but is astonished to find out, contrary to the assertions of her recruiting sergeant, that she cannot leave.

Army regulations and the disapproval of Captain Doreen Lewis and Sergeant First Class L.C. Ross, the drill sergeant, frustrate Judy. However, when her parents arrive at Fort Biloxi to take her home, she decides to stay and finish basic training. Judy completes her training after a war games exercise in which she leads her squad in capturing the opposing team. Upon graduation from basic training, Judy and her friends spend the weekend on leave in New Orleans, where she meets Henri Tremont, a French doctor attending a medical conference. After a brief but inspiring romance, Henri returns to Paris, and Judy begins training with an elite paratrooper unit, the Thornbirds.

Judy quickly discovers that she was chosen for paratrooper training because unit commander Colonel Thornbush finds her attractive. Because she is too scared to jump after the other trainees have jumped from the plane, he attempts to sexually assault her. When Judy jumps out of the plane rather than comply, he attempts to have her transferred. Judy negotiates an assignment to Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Belgium, and meets up with Henri again on a visit to Paris. He proposes marriage, and she accepts. After Captain Lewis discovers that Tremont is a communist, Judy is forced to choose between the Army and love.

Following his engagement to Judy, Henri reveals his self-centered, controlling nature. He tries to &quot;remake&quot; Judy and insists she sign a prenuptial agreement. Finally, when Henri sleeps with the housemaid and makes it obvious that he has not gotten over his ex-girlfriend Clare, Judy has a change of heart. On the day of the wedding ceremony, she punches Henri and abandons him at the altar, throws her bridal veil into the wind, and walks alone into the unknown, empowered by her newfound freedom.

==Reception==
The film holds a score of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Private Benjamin&quot; proves a potent showcase for its Oscar-nominated star, with Goldie Hawn making the most of a story that rests almost completely on her daffily irresistible charm.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and praised it as &quot;an appealing, infectious comedy&quot; in a review that concluded: &quot;Goldie Hawn, who is a true comic actress, makes an original, appealing character out of Judy Benjamin, and so the movie feels alive, not just an exercise in gags and situations.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Hawn &quot;totally charming&quot; and praised Zieff&#x27;s &quot;great skill at keeping the gags aloft and in finding new ways by which to free the laughs trapped inside old routines about latrine duty, war games, forced marches and calisthenics.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, calling it &quot;old-fashioned, commercial Hollywood filmmaking at its best — an upbeat, delightful comedy with a gentle message.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is actually a double feature — one is a frequently funny tale of an innocent who is conned into joining the U.S. Army and her adventures therein; the other deals with the same innocent&#x27;s personality problems as a Jewish princess with only an intermittent chuckle to help out.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; panned the film, calling it &quot;a movie you don&#x27;t salute, you court martial. It may or may not violate the Articles of War but it raises holy hob with the laws of film making, the first of which is that you start with a good script.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a peculiarly unappealing throwback to the traditional service comedies like &quot;Buck Privates&quot;, &quot;Caught in the Draft&quot;, &quot;See Here, Private Hargrove&quot;, et al.,&quot; with an &quot;aimless screenplay&quot; that leaves Hawn&#x27;s character &quot;less likable than the one at the beginning.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: &quot;Goldie Hawn demonstrates what an accomplished comedienne she is—she carries &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; on her back.&quot; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; called the film &quot;an uneven but highly enjoyable mixture of sociological satire, basic-training slapstick and feminist fable.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Private Benjamin&quot; grossed $4,739,769 from 763 theaters in its opening weekend, finishing at the top of the US box office. It added 36 more screens the following weekend and increased its gross to $4,935,571, finishing number one again, with a 10-day gross of $11.5 million. On a final production budget of $9.2 million, it earned almost $70 million at the box office.

==Awards and nominations==
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #82
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** Pvt. Judy Benjamin: &quot;I did join the Army, but I joined a different Army. I joined the one with the condos and the private rooms.&quot; – Nominated

==Television series==
In 1981, &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; was made into an Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning television series of the same title that ran from 1981 to 1983. Set during the events of the film, it starred Lorna Patterson, Eileen Brennan, Hal Williams, Lisa Raggio, Wendie Jo Sperber and Joel Brooks. For the series, Brennan and Williams reprised their film roles, again portraying Captain Doreen Lewis and Sergeant L. C. Ross respectively.

==Remake==
In March 2010, Anna Faris was cast to portray Judy Benjamin in a &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; remake from New Line Cinema, but in May 2014, it was confirmed that Rebel Wilson would portray Benjamin in the remake. Amy Talkington was in discussion to write the script, which would update both the story and screenplay on which Harvey Miller, Nancy Meyers, and Charles Shyer had initially collaborated. Mark Gordon was set to produce.

The new adaptation Talkington was exploring would reset Miller&#x27;s, Meyers&#x27;, and Shyer&#x27;s story in present day and set it against the backdrop of current military conflicts. According to insiders, the studio wanted neither to make fun of military service people nor take political potshots, but sought instead to focus on the empowerment elements and build upon the fish-out-of-water comedy.

<doc id="240372" wikidata="Q627942" url="?curid=240372" title="Gloria (1980 film)">
<text>Gloria is a 1980 American neo-noir crime thriller film written and directed by John Cassavetes. It tells the story of a gangster&#x27;s former girlfriend who goes on the run with a young boy who is being hunted by the mob for information he may or may not have. It stars Gena Rowlands, Julie Carmen, Buck Henry, and John Adames.

The film had its world premiere at the 37th Venice International Film Festival, winning the Golden Lion, the festival&#x27;s top prize, in a tie with &quot;Atlantic City&quot; by Louis Malle.

==Plot==
In New York City, in the South Bronx, Jeri Dawn is heading home with groceries. Inside the lobby of her apartment building, she passes a man whose dress and appearance are out of place. The woman quickly boards the elevator.

She is met in her apartment by her husband Jack Dawn, an accountant for a New York City mob family. There is a contract on Jack and his family, as he has been acting as an informant for the FBI. Suddenly, the family&#x27;s neighbor, Gloria Swenson, rings their doorbell, asking to borrow some coffee. Jeri tells Gloria there is an impending hit on her family and implores Gloria to protect her children. Gloria, formerly a mobster&#x27;s girlfriend, tells Jeri that she doesn&#x27;t like kids but begrudgingly agrees. The Dawns&#x27; daughter Joan refuses to leave and locks herself in the bathroom. While the family attempts to get Joan, Gloria takes their young son Phil, and an incriminating accounts ledger, to her apartment, narrowly missing the hit squad.

After hearing loud shotgun blasts from the Dawns&#x27; apartment, a visibly shaken Gloria decides that she and Phil must go into hiding. After quickly packing a bag they leave the building, just as a police SWAT team is entering with heavy weapons. Meanwhile, a crowd of onlookers and news reporters has gathered in front of the building, and a cameraman captures a picture of them leaving.

Gloria and Phil take a cab into Manhattan, where they hide out in an empty apartment belonging to a friend of hers. The following morning, Phil sneaks out of the apartment and sees his photograph on the front page of several newspapers. Later on, Gloria watches the news on television, which reports the mob hit and names her as Phil&#x27;s suspected abductor.

The next morning, realizing they are not safe where they are, Gloria and Phil sneak out of the apartment just as a group of gangsters close in on them. The gangsters know Gloria and confront her on the sidewalk outside, exhorting her to give up Phil and the ledger. In desperation, Gloria shoots her revolver at the car of five gangsters, which takes off and flips over. Gloria realizes both her fate and Phil&#x27;s are now deeply intertwined, and that they will have to leave New York to survive.

Gloria goes to the bank to empty her safe deposit box, and the two settle for the night at a flophouse. She confronts another group of gangsters at a restaurant; she asks for immunity in exchange for the ledger. &quot;Only Mr. Tanzinni can agree to that&quot;, says one of the goons, so she takes some of their guns and flees.

The next day, Gloria tells Phil that she plans to send him away to a boarding school. Offended by her intentions, Phil claims he is an independent grown man who can manage alone. Gloria decides to abandon him and have a drink. She is soon filled with guilt for leaving the child and rushes back to look for him; however, he has been captured by some wiseguys. Gloria rescues him, killing one mobster in the process, and fleeing from two others via a taxi and the subway, where several by-standers help her escape.

The two eventually make it to a hotel room, where Gloria laments the mob&#x27;s strength and ubiquitous presence, explaining to Phil that she was once the mistress of Tanzinni himself. She meets with Tanzinni, relinquishes the ledger, and then flees, killing one gangster as another shoots down upon her elevator car. Phil waits several hours, then flees to Pittsburgh via rail. At a cemetery, Phil and Gloria (the latter disguised as the former&#x27;s grandmother arriving in a limousine after miraculously surviving her ordeal) reunite.

==Production==
John Cassavetes did not originally intend to direct his screenplay; he planned merely to sell the story to Columbia Pictures. However, once his wife, Gena Rowlands, was asked to play the title character in the film, she asked Cassavetes to direct it. &quot;Gloria&quot; is John Adames&#x27; only film role.

A sequel was in the works before Cassavetes&#x27;s death. 

==Reception and legacy==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% approval rating based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A comparatively commercial entry from director John Cassavetes, &quot;Gloria&quot;″s pulpy pleasures are elevated by his observant touch and Gena Rowlands&#x27; galvanizing star performance.&quot;

Reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and described it as &quot;tough, sweet and goofy&quot;, as well as &quot;fun and engaging but slight&quot;. He believed the overly silly nature of the script is redeemed by &quot;Cassavetes&#x27; reliance on a tried-and-true plot construction&quot; and the acting performances, particularly that of Rowlands, who he said &quot;propels the action with such appealing nervous energy that we don&#x27;t have the heart to stop and think how silly everything is&quot;. In a retrospective review, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; praised Rowlands&#x27; performance and said that &quot;the supporting cast pales in comparison to Rowlands&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Gloria Swenson – Nominated Hero

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;Gloria&quot; as one of his favorite films.

The film was remade in 1999 under the same title with a screenplay by Steve Antin. The remake was directed by Sidney Lumet. It starred Sharon Stone and Jean-Luke Figueroa.

Other films inspired by &quot;Gloria&quot; include Erick Zonca&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Julia&quot;, starring Tilda Swinton and Luc Besson&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot;. In 2013, Paul Schrader was planning his own remake of the film, starring Lindsay Lohan. And, in 2018, Taraji P. Henson starred in a loose remake entitled &quot;Proud Mary&quot;.

===John Adames===
The film is notable for the performance of child actor John Adames (also known as Juan Adames), for which he won the first ever Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor, shared with Laurence Olivier for his role in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. Adames, who had been cast after an open call, was between five and seven years old when cast, and his character Phil Dawn was six. He did not have any subsequent film roles afterwards.

Adames&#x27; performance was criticized by contemporary reviewers, who according to critic Ray Carney, expected Adames to be &quot;cute and cuddly&quot;, and when he was not, they judged that Cassavetes had failed. Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant&quot; magazine posited that the criticism was due to Adames&#x27; vocal delivery, which he compared to &quot;what Paddy Chayefsky would sound like impersonating Alvin Chipmunk&quot;.

Roger Ebert praised Adames&#x27; performance, calling him &quot;well cast&quot;. Writing for &quot;Film Comment&quot; in 2017, Shonni Enelow revisited Adames&#x27; performance as the &quot;crucial positive negative&quot; that &quot;makes the film work&quot;.
