<text>Neman, Nemunas or Niemen is a river in Europe that rises in central Belarus and flows through Lithuania then forms the northern border of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia&#x27;s western exclave, which specifically follows its southern channel. It drains into the Curonian Lagoon, narrowly connected to the Baltic Sea. The long Neman is a major Eastern European river. It flows generally west to Grodno within of the Polish border, north to Kaunas, then westward again to the sea.

The largest river in Lithuania, and the third-largest in Belarus, it is navigable for most of its length. It starts from two small headwaters merging about southwest of the town of Uzda – about southwest of capital city Minsk. Only , an eastward meander, contributes to the Belarus–Lithuania border. Thereafter the river includes notable loops along a minor tectonic fault.

Its drainage basin settled in the late Quaternary to be roughly along the edge of the last glacial sheet so dates to about 25,000 to 22,000 years BC. Its depth varies from in its upper courses to in the lower basin.

==River course==
===Nemunas loops===
Due to their location, &quot;the Nemunas loops&quot; are often described using the Lithuanian name for the river. In 1992 Nemunas Loops Regional Park was founded. Its goal is to preserve the loops (Lithuanian: &quot;vingis&quot;) that the river makes in the Punia forest. Near Prienai, the river makes a loop (like a teardrop) coming within of completing the loop. Nemunas flows along the double bend between Balbieriškis and Birštonas for and then moves in a northerly direction for only . The loops are not conventional river meanders; they follow underlying tectonic structures. The faults are the source of local mineral springs. The area is historically and culturally significant. Its castles served as the first line of defense against forays by the Teutonic knights.

===Delta===

At its delta Nemunas splits into a maze of river branches and canals mixing with polders and wetlands and is a very attractive destination for eco-tourism. The four main distributaries are Atmata, Pakalnė, Skirvytė (the southern mouth, marking the international border) and Gilija. The river plays a crucial part in the ecosystem of the Curonian Lagoon. It provides the main water inflow to the lagoon and keeps the water almost fresh. This allows fresh water and brackish water animals to survive there. As the delta extends north the lagoon opposite narrows. Since the delta is in Lithuania, it is often referred to as &quot;Nemunas Delta&quot;. Nemunas Delta Regional Park was created in the delta in 1992.

===Tributaries ===
The following rivers are tributaries to the river Neman/Nemunas (from source to mouth):

*Left: Servach, Mowchadz’, Shchara, Zelvyanka, Svislach, Lasosna, Czarna Hańcza, Zembrė, Peršėkė, Šešupė, Tylzha
*Right: Western Berezina, Gauja, Kotra, Haradnichanka, Merkys, Verknė, Strėva, Neris, Nevėžis, Dubysa, Mituva, Jūra, Minija

===Largest settlements on the river===
From west to east, the largest settlements are Sovetsk/Tilsit, Neman, Kaunas, Alytus, Druskininkai, Grodno, and Masty.

==Significance in culture==
Ptolemy referred to Neman as Chronos (although competing theories suppose Chronos was in fact Pregolya).

The river has lent its name to the Neman Culture, a Neolithic archaeological subculture.
In German, the part of the river flowing through historic Prussia has been called &#x27; at least since about 1250, when Teutonic Knights built &#x27; castle and the town of &quot;&quot; at the mouth of the Curonian Lagoon, naming it after the indigenous name of the river, Memel. The city of Memel, now in Lithuania, is known today as Klaipėda (confusingly, another city of Memel was on the Dange River, now called the Danė). In German road maps and lexika, only the section within Prussia (starting at Schmalleningken) was named Memel; the bulk of the river was Niemen.

The border between the State of the Teutonic Order and Lithuania was fixed in 1422 by the Treaty of Lake Melno and remained stable for centuries. The Treaty of Tilsit between Napoleon and Tsar Alexander I was signed on a raft in the river in 1807. Napoleon&#x27;s crossing at the outset of the 1812 French invasion of Russia is described in &quot;War and Peace&quot; and also mentioned in &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;. In 1919, the Treaty of Versailles made the river the border separating the Memel Territory from German East Prussia as of 1920. At that time, Germany&#x27;s Weimar Republic adopted the &quot;&quot; as its official national anthem. In the first stanza of the song, written in 1841, the river is mentioned as the eastern border of a (then politically yet-to-be united) Germany:

Lithuanians refer to Nemunas as &quot;the father of rivers&quot; (&quot;Nemunas&quot; is a masculine noun in Lithuanian). Countless companies and organizations in Lithuania have &quot;Nemunas&quot; in their name, including a folklore ensemble, a weekly magazine about art and culture, a sanatorium, and numerous guest houses and hotels. Lithuanian and Polish literature often mention the Nemunas. One of the most famous poems by Maironis starts:
Smaller rivers and rivulets in Lithuania with names morphologically derived or cognate are the Nemunykštis, Nemuniukas, Nemunynas, Nemunėlis and Nemunaitis.

The etymology is disputed: some say that &quot;Nemunas&quot; is an old word meaning &quot;a damp place&quot;, while others that it is &quot;mute, soundless river&quot; (from &quot;nemti, nėmti&quot; &quot;to become silent&quot;, also &quot;memelis, mimelis, mėmė&quot; &quot;slow, worthless person&quot;). The name is possibly derived from the Finnic word &quot;niemi&quot; &quot;cape&quot;.

Art critics praised its depiction in the paintings by Michał Kulesza.

==Economic significance==

Much of the river is used for fishing, hydropower generation, water supply, industry, agriculture, recreation, tourism, and water transport.

Lithuania has tabled local plans to dredge it, below Kaunas, to make it more consistently usable.

The largest cities on the river are Grodno in Belarus, Alytus and Kaunas in Lithuania, and Sovetsk in the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia. The river basin has a population of 5.4 million inhabitants. Industrial activities in the Belarusian section include metal processing, chemical industries, pulp and paper production, and manufacturing of building materials, as well as food-processing plants. In Lithuania, the city of Kaunas, with about 400,000 inhabitants, is the country&#x27;s principal user of the river; the local industries that impact the river are hydropower generation, machinery, chemical, wood processing and paper production, furniture production, textile and food-processing. In Kaliningrad, industrial centers near the river include Sovetsk and Neman, which have large pulp and paper production facilities.

Above Kaunas a dam was built in 1959 to serve the Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant. The resulting Kaunas Reservoir () is the largest such lake in Lithuania. It occupies ; its length is ; its greatest depth is . The reservoir is a popular destination for Lithuanian yachting.

The Augustów Canal, built in the 19th century, connects Neman to Vistula river.

==Biological communities==
Fish found include the: perch, pike, zander, roach, tench, bream, rudd, ruffe, and bleak.

Its tributaries have borne stone loach, three-spined stickleback, minnows, trout, sculpins, gudgeon, dace and chub.

Atlantic salmon migrated upstream to spawn; however, dams on the river, most of them built in the 20th century, have depleted them. The dam at Kaunas does not provide fish ladders. The spawning season took place in the fall. Ethnographic studies, from before the dams, state night fishing, using torches and harpoons, was a common technique.

==Environmental issues==

A report by the Swedish EPA (Environmental Protection Administration) rates the river&#x27;s quality in Lithuania as moderately polluted to polluted. High concentrations of organic pollutants, nitrates and phosphates occur in parts of the river. Environmental issues include water quality (eutrophication and pollutants largely due to outdated technology sewage treatment works), changes in the hydrological regime, and flooding control. The environmental problems in each of the countries that make up the basin are slightly different. In Belarus, the main problems are oil products as well as nitrogen and BOD (biological oxygen demand). The environmental issues in the Kaliningrad section include high concentrations of BOD, lignosulphates, and nitrogen. In Lithuania, the Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant barrage affects the riparian ecosystem.

Co-operation which would be beneficial is complicated by the geographical split between three nations but water quality improvement initiatives are underway.

<doc id="226854" wikidata="Q7730213" url="?curid=226854" title="The Dingoes">
<text>The Dingoes are an Australian country rock band. They were initially active from 1973 to 1979, and reformed in 2009. Initially based in Melbourne, the band relocated to the United States from 1976. The most stable line-up comprised John Bois on bass guitar, John Lee on drums, Broderick Smith on vocals and harmonica, Chris Stockley on guitar, and Kerryn Tolhurst on guitar. Mal Logan (who provided keyboards on the first LP) on keyboards joined after Stockley was hospitalised when shot in the stomach by Melbourne drug-dealer, Dennis Allen, who was attempting to gate crash a party. The Dingoes&#x27; debut single, &quot;Way Out West&quot;, was released in November 1973, and peaked in the top 40 of the Australian Kent Music Report singles chart. Subsequent singles were &quot;Boy on the Run&quot;, &quot;Smooth Sailing&quot;, and &quot;Into the Night&quot;, which did not reach the top 50. They had three top 40 albums, &quot;The Dingoes&quot; in 1974, &quot;Five Times the Sun&quot; in 1977, and &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; in 1979.

On 27 August 2009, The Dingoes were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, Little Pattie, Mental As Anything, and John Paul Young. The Dingoes reformed in late 2009 and released a new album, &quot;Tracks&quot; in 2010 which was followed by a tour of Australia. A live album &quot;Live at Last&quot; came out after the tour, which prompted another tour – this time without Bois who could not get away from his day job.

==Previous bands==
Kerryn Tolhurst, lead guitarist, mandolin-player, and singer-songwriter founded Adderley Smith Blues Band in 1964 in Melbourne, which was one of Australia&#x27;s first authentic blues bands. Lead vocalist and harmonica-player Broderick Smith joined in 1966, both Smith and Tolhurst were conscripted into the Army as part of National Service during the Vietnam War for two years from 1968 to 1970. Smith was unable to continue with the band but Tolhurst was able to keep a line-up performing, including Joe Camilleri on saxophone in 1970. After National Service, Tolhurst formed Sundown, with singer-songwriter Keith Glass, as a country rock group, Smith briefly joined Sundown before going on to blues boogie band, Carson in 1971. After Sundown, Tolhurst joined singer-songwriter Greg Quill in his country rock group Country Radio during 1972–1973. Quill and Tolhurst co-wrote their hit singles &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; and &quot;Wintersong&quot;.

Both Carson (with Smith) and Country Radio (before Tolhurst joined) had performed at the inaugural Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1972. At the second festival in January 1973, Carson (with Smith) performed and recorded their set, including a track called &quot;Dingo&quot;, which was released on their live album, &quot;On the Air&quot; in April. Country Radio (with Tolhurst) had also performed, and live tracks from both bands were included on the first ever Mushroom Records album, as a triple-LP, &quot;The Great Australian Rock Festival Sunbury 1973&quot;. After the 1973 festival, both Smith and Tolhurst left their respective bands. Tolhurst briefly joined Mississippi which later became Little River Band. Smith, in March, played the role of &quot;The Father&quot; in the Australian production of the rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;, which was staged in Sydney and Melbourne.

Guitarist, Chris Stockley (ex-Roadrunners, Delta Set), formed psychedelic rock group Cam-Pact with Keith Glass in 1967, both had left by late 1969. Stockley joined rock group Axiom, which had top ten hits with &quot;Arkansas Grass&quot; and &quot;A Little Ray Of Sunshine&quot;, before they disbanded in 1971. John Lee (ex-Sayla) had been drummer for Blackfeather from February to April 1973. John Strangio was bass guitarist for St James Infirmary and Middle Earth.

==Formation and early years==
The Dingoes with John Lee on drums, Broderick Smith on lead vocals and harmonica, Chris Stockley on lead guitar, John Strangio on bass guitar, and Kerryn Tolhurst on guitar and mandolin, were formed in Melbourne in April 1973. Strangio left in August and was replaced on bass guitar by John Bois, who had been a member of Melbourne &#x27;60s pop band New Dream and was later a member (with Tolhurst) of Country Radio. The Dingoes combined R&amp;B, country and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll with songs that used Australian themes and imagery.

The Dingoes were an early signing to the fledgling Mushroom Records label, it issued their debut single &quot;Way Out West&quot; which was jointly credited to Lee, Bois, Smith, Stockley, and Tolhurst although Bois&#x27; book confirms that the song was written by Tolhurst alone. A week before the single was released Stockley received a serious gunshot wound during an incident at a party in Melbourne that resulted in a two-month stay in hospital, initially described as an &#x27;accidental shooting&#x27;, according to music historian, Ian McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop&quot;, Stockley was shot by notorious drug dealer Dennis Allen, who was trying to gate crash the party. An eight-hour benefit concert was held for Stockley on 4 November 1973 at Leggett&#x27;s Ballroom, Greville Street, Prahran. While recuperating, Stockley was replaced by keyboard player Mal Logan (ex Healing Force, Carson), who stayed on, after Stockley returned, until the end of 1974.

Released in October 1973, &quot;Way Out West&quot; peaked into the top 40 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart, and reached No. 26 in Melbourne, it became their signature tune. The Dingoes appeared at the third Sunbury Pop Festival in 1974, held on the Australia Day long weekend, and their performance featured on Mushroom&#x27;s &quot;Highlights of Sunbury &#x27;74&quot;, released later that year. The same month, they recorded their self-titled debut LP, &quot;The Dingoes&quot;, which was produced by John French. Logan contributed keyboards on several tracks, including &quot;Goin&#x27; Down&quot; and &quot;Sydney Ladies&quot;. &quot;Way Out West&quot; was later covered by James Blundell and James Reyne (ex-Australian Crawl) in 1992, their version peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Singles Charts, Smith supplied harmonica for this version.

Lee left in May 1974 to join Ariel and was replaced on drums by Ray Arnott, (ex-Cam-Pact with Stockley, Spectrum, Mighty Kong). &quot;The Dingoes&quot; was released in June 1974, along with a second single &quot;Boy on the Run&quot;, co-written by Stockley and Smith, which peaked at No. 24 in Melbourne but did not break into the top 50 nationally. The LP reached No. 24 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart in July, it was the Federation of Australian Broadcasters&#x27; &quot;Album of the Year&quot; for 1974. A non-album single, &quot;Smooth Sailing&quot;, written by Tolhurst, and backed with &quot;Dingoes Lament&quot; (an instrumental written by Bois), was released in October. During the year The Dingoes toured nationally with various artists including Bad Company, Leo Sayer, Bo Diddley, and Freddy Fender.

==North America==
Early in 1975, after appearing at the fourth Sunbury Pop Festival, The Dingoes received a phone call from expatriate Australian roadie Billy McCartney, who had seen them when visiting from the United States, where he had established himself as a tour manager for Elvis Presley and Rod Stewart. Returning to the US, McCartney recommended the band to Peter Rudge, who was then tour manager for The Rolling Stones and Lynyrd Skynyrd, and, after ten months negotiations, Rudge agreed to manage The Dingoes in the US.

The following months frustrated the band—with an expected summons from Rudge at any time, they were unable to commit to long-term tours or to recording—they lost valuable ground in Australia when they could have consolidated on the success of the LP and singles. Meanwhile, they provided two tracks, &quot;Marijuana Hell&quot; and the Percy Sledge cover &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; to the Various Artists live album &quot;Live at the Station&quot; which was released on Lamington Records in 1976. An American tour was finally arranged for mid-1976, by the time they arrived Rudge&#x27;s attention was focused on Lynyrd Skynyrd. Just prior to leaving, Arnott quit the group by &quot;mutual agreement&quot; and Lee returned to the fold, meeting up with the band in North America. Arnott pursued a solo career and was later with Renée Geyer Band, Cold Chisel, and Jimmy Barnes.

The Dingoes signed a two-album deal with US-based, A&amp;M records, on recommendations from McCartney and Rudge, and undertook three months of rehearsals in Canada, then headed for the US, where they set up base in Mill Valley, Northern California, at the start of 1977. They recorded tracks for their A&amp;M album, &quot;Five Times the Sun&quot;, in San Francisco during January and February, produced by Elliot Mazer (Janis Joplin, Neil Young) at His Masters Wheels recording studio, with session contributions from keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and Garth Hudson; it featured liner notes by author Emmett Grogan. &quot;Five Times the Sun&quot;, which peaked at No. 25 on the Australian albums chart in August, included re-recorded versions of tracks from their first album. &quot;Way Out West&quot; and &quot;Smooth Sailing&quot;, released in September, as a double A-single in Australia, did not peak into the top 50. Soon after, band members were granted their prized green cards, allowing them to base themselves in US, in their two-year stay they toured 40 states by road. A serious blow to the band&#x27;s future came on 20 October when several members of proposed tour mates, Lynyrd Skynyrd, were killed in a plane crash, a tragedy which destroyed the morale of The Dingoes&#x27; management team.

Stockley left the band and returned to Australia in early 1978, initially he joined Greg Quill&#x27;s new band Southern Cross, and later founded Stockley, See &amp; Mason. He was replaced in The Dingoes by American session guitarist Andrew Jeffers-Hardin, the group had moved east and settled near Woodstock, in upstate New York. In mid-1978, they recorded a third album, &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot;, at New York&#x27;s famed The Hit Factory, and continued to tour around the US until late 1978, but their efforts to enter the US record charts were unrealised. &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; was released in February 1979, along with a final single, &quot;Into the Night&quot;, but by this time Smith had returned to Australia and The Dingoes had split.
They are touring with Joe Cocker in Australia for the 2011 &quot;Day on the Green&quot; concerts.

==After The Dingoes==

Smith came back to Australia in late 1978 and fronted his own bands including Broderick Smith&#x27;s Big Combo. He branched out into TV acting with appearances in the Australian series &quot;Janus&quot;, &quot;Law of the Land&quot;, &quot;Snowy River: The McGregor Saga&quot;, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, and &quot;State Coroner&quot;. He worked in an acoustic duo with musical partner Mick Ahearne and played harmonica with Backsliders, alternating with Ian Collard (Collard, Greens and Gravy) as a replacement for founding member Jim Conway. and has continued to record and release solo albums. In 2013, Smith collaborated with the psychedelic band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, which his son Ambrose is a member of, on their album &quot;Eyes Like the Sky&quot;. The record is structured around a story that was written and narrated by Smith.

Bois, Lee, and Tolhurst, all remained in the US. Bois returned to study, gained a master&#x27;s degree and became a high school biology teacher, living and working in Maryland, USA, and later moving to Florida, USA. As an amateur expert on dinosaurs he contributed to the BBC TV series &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;. During his teaching years, he also wrote a creative memoir of his time in The Dingoes, entitled &quot;The Dingoes&#x27; Lament&quot; (named after his track on their debut album), which remained unpublished until 2012. He later had an article published in the Historical Biology: An International Journal of Paleobiology in 2017.

After The Dingoes, Lee joined a later lineup of cult Washington group Root Boy Slim &amp; the Sex Change Band, and eventually settled in Washington DC, where he worked with local group Johnny Bombay &amp; the Reactions, before moving to Nashville, Tennessee. During his time in the USA Lee worked with a wide variety of artists (including Steve Marriott) until his return to Australia in the late 1990s. Unfortunately, by this time, years of alcohol abuse had taken a heavy toll on his health and John died from liver failure in July 1999. A posthumously-released CD compilation, &quot;Back 2 3 4&quot;, included The Dingoes&#x27; &quot;So Long For So Little&quot;, a track recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York in the late 1970s, which had previously been included on The Dingoes &quot;Way Out West&quot; compilation (1992).

Tolhurst lived and worked in New York for many years, and continued his career as a songwriter, performer, and producer, both in Australia and in the US. A slightly reworked version of his song &quot;All Fired Up&quot; became a major hit for Pat Benatar in 1988, making the Top 20 in the US and Canada, and reaching No. 2 in Australia, where it was No. 16 on the End of Year Singles Chart. In 1995, Tolhurst collaborated with Paul Kelly on his &quot;Deeper Water&quot; album, in NYC. He was co-producer and performer in the &quot;Spirit Returns&quot; album and concert, which featured the reformed Goanna, Ross Hannaford (ex-Daddy Cool), and Liam O&#x27;Maonlai (Hothouse Flowers) at the Melbourne Festival in 1998. He produced numerous albums in NY including &#x27;Little Pieces &#x27; and &#x27;The Way I See It&#x27; for R&amp; B legend Jimmy Norman. In 2006 he moved to Tucson, Arizona, and set up a studio where he recorded Shane Howard&#x27;s &#x27;Goanna Dreaming&#x27; and The Dingoes reunion album &#x27;Tracks&#x27;. After touring with The Dingoes and producing their live album, &#x27;Live at Last&#x27;, Tolhurst returned to live in Australia in 2010 and continues to work as a producer and live performer.

==Reformation==
On 27 August 2009, The Dingoes were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, Little Pattie, Mental As Anything, and John Paul Young. They were inducted into the Hall of Fame by Richard Clapton and performed &quot;Way Out West&quot; and &quot;Boy on the Run&quot;. Melbourne drummer Ashley Davies (ex-Wild Pumpkins at Midnight) joined Bois, Smith, Stockley, and Tolhurst in the reformed group which recorded &quot;Tracks&quot; in late 2009 and early 2010. The new album was released on 6 August 2010, coinciding with an Australia tour, it debuted at No. 14 on the ARIA Country Music Top 20 Chart. In October 2010, their debut album, &quot;The Dingoes&quot; (1974) was listed in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

In 2012 John Bois&#x27; memoir &quot;The Dingoes&#x27; Lament&quot; was published by Melbourne Books and at the end of December 2012 the group reformed (for possibly the last time) for a short series of concerts in Victoria. The lineup again comprised the four surviving original members, with Ashley Davies on drums, and the mini-tour included three sold-out shows at the Caravan Music Club in Oakleigh, Melbourne, where they were supported by Steve Hoy and Ross Hannaford.

In May 2023, Smith&#x27;s website was updated to announce his death at age 75.

<doc id="226856" wikidata="Q651593" url="?curid=226856" title="Norton's theorem">
<text>In direct-current circuit theory, Norton&#x27;s theorem, also called the Mayer–Norton theorem, is a simplification that can be applied to networks made of linear time-invariant resistances, voltage sources, and current sources. At a pair of terminals of the network, it can be replaced by a current source and a single resistor in parallel. 

For alternating current (AC) systems the theorem can be applied to reactive impedances as well as resistances. The Norton equivalent circuit is used to represent any network of linear sources and impedances at a given frequency.

Norton&#x27;s theorem and its dual, Thévenin&#x27;s theorem, are widely used for circuit analysis simplification and to study circuit&#x27;s initial-condition and steady-state response.

Norton&#x27;s theorem was independently derived in 1926 by Siemens &amp; Halske researcher Hans Ferdinand Mayer (1895–1980) and Bell Labs engineer Edward Lawry Norton (1898–1983).

To find the Norton equivalent of a linear time-invariant circuit, the Norton current &quot;I&quot;no is calculated as the current flowing at the two terminals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of the original circuit that is now short (zero impedance between the terminals). The Norton resistance &quot;R&quot;no is found by calculating the output voltage &quot;Vo&quot; produced at &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; with no resistance or load connected to, then &quot;R&quot;no = &quot;Vo&quot; / &quot;Ino&quot;; equivalently, this is the resistance between the terminals with all (independent) voltage sources short-circuited and independent current sources open-circuited (i.e., each independent source is set to produce zero energy). This is equivalent to calculating the Thevenin resistance.

When there are dependent sources, the more general method must be used. The voltage at the terminals is calculated for an injection of a 1 ampere test current at the terminals. This voltage divided by the 1 A current is the Norton impedance &quot;R&quot;no (in ohms). This method must be used if the circuit contains dependent sources, but it can be used in all cases even when there are no dependent sources.

==Example of a Norton equivalent circuit==

In the example, the total current &quot;I&quot;total is given by:

:formula_1

The current through the load is then, using the current divider rule:

:formula_2

And the equivalent resistance looking back into the circuit is:

:formula_3

So the equivalent circuit is a 3.75 mA current source in parallel with a 2 kΩ resistor.

==Conversion to a Thévenin equivalent==

A Norton equivalent circuit is related to the Thévenin equivalent by the equations:
:formula_4
An original circuit and its Thévenin and Norton equivalents have the same voltage between the two open-circuited terminals, and the same short-circuited current in between.

==Queueing theory==
The passive circuit equivalent of &quot;Norton&#x27;s theorem&quot; in queuing theory is called the Chandy Herzog Woo theorem. In a reversible queueing system, it is often possible to replace an uninteresting subset of queues by a single (FCFS or PS) queue with an appropriately chosen service rate.

<doc id="226861" wikidata="Q12061901" url="?curid=226861" title="Mister Peepers">
<text>Mister Peepers is an American sitcom that aired on NBC from July 3, 1952, to June 12, 1955.

==Overview==
Wally Cox starred as Robinson J. Peepers, Jefferson City&#x27;s junior high school science teacher. Others in the cast included Tony Randall as history teacher Harvey Weskit; Georgiann Johnson as Harvey&#x27;s wife, Marge; Patricia Benoit as school nurse Nancy Remington; Marion Lorne as oft-confused English teacher Mrs. Gurney; Jack Warden as athletic coach Frank Whip; and Ernest Truex and Sylvia Field as Nancy&#x27;s parents.

The series began as a live summer replacement for &quot;Ford Festival&quot;, and was so popular that thousands wrote to NBC praising the series. When the Fall 1952 television season began, the filmed series &quot;Doc Corkle&quot; was so unpopular that additional scripts for &quot;Mr. Peepers&quot; were quickly written, and that series replaced &quot;Doc Corkle&quot; in October.

The series often involved Peepers coping with misbehaving inanimate objects or embarrassing moments. In a typical scene, Peepers sees a hopscotch grid chalked on a sidewalk, and thinking himself alone, plays the game with abandon, only to discover that his girlfriend Nancy has been silently watching the entire time.
The principal&#x27;s dithering wife, Mrs. Gurney, played by Marion Lorne, is kind and gracious, but absentminded. In one episode, Peepers injures his finger with a hammer, and Mrs. Gurney solicitously bandages his finger to at least five times its actual size. After Mrs. Gurney leaves the room, Peepers tells Nancy that the wrong finger had been bandaged.

Tony Randall played history teacher Harvey Weskit. Popular and confident Weskit becomes the best friend of timid, bespectacled Peepers. In one episode, Weskit points out a packet of unopened love letters that women have sent him, complaining that he is always getting them. He begins to look inside Peepers&#x27; locker to see the stack of similar letters he expects to find there, and Peepers quickly closes the locker door, commenting that he has to keep the door closed so that they will not all fall out.

Patricia Benoit, as Nancy Remington, is Peepers&#x27; love interest, although for a time, she seems unaware of his attraction to her. By February 1954, though, the couple&#x27;s romance had progressed to the point of Mr. Peepers presenting Nancy with a photograph of himself, inscribed &quot;Scientifically yours, Robinson&quot;. Peepers proposed on the April 18th episode, and the couple wed on the May 30, 1954, show. The marriage episode was one of the major television events of 1954. The American TV magazine &quot;TV Guide&quot; used the picture of the couple&#x27;s television wedding on its cover page.

&quot;Mister Peepers&quot; was aired live, on stage before an audience at the New Century Theatre, 932 7th Avenue, New York City—preserved in the form of 16 mm kinescopes.

Wally Cox was somewhat typecast by the role of the mild-mannered Peepers, but continued on to a long career in films and television. He later starred in a comedy/adventure series, &quot;The Adventures of Hiram Holliday&quot;, and is remembered as the voice of the cartoon superhero &quot;Underdog&quot;. He is best remembered by game-show fans as a regular panelist on &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; from 1966 until his death in 1973. He also wrote and published a novel, &quot;Mr. Peepers&quot; (1955), based on scripts from the televised adventures of the character.

== Production ==
David Swift created the show and wrote for it, along with Jim Fritzell. Fred Coe was the producer, and Hal Keith was the director. Bernie Green was the music director.

==Episode status==
Reportedly, 102 of the 127 episode Kinescopes of &quot;Mister Peepers&quot; survive. RetroTV aired episodes of the show on Wednesday mornings, but as of 2021, no longer does.

==DVD release==
In 2005, the first 26 episodes of &quot;Mister Peepers&quot;, which had been preserved by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, were released on DVD by S&#x27;more Entertainment. In November 2008, the second boxed set of &quot;Mister Peepers&quot; was released by S&#x27;more Entertainment. The tagline at the bottom of the box reads: &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Science Teacher, Underdog and All-Round Nice Guy.&quot; The Underdog comment coyly references Cox&#x27;s later role as the voice of the title character in the &quot;Underdog&quot; cartoon.

&quot;Mister Peepers&quot; began as a summer replacement series in 1952. The first DVD set, titled &quot;Mr. Peepers&quot;, contains the summer episodes, as well as those from October 1952 to March 1953 episodes of the first full season. The &quot;Mister Peepers - Season 2&quot; DVD sets picks up where the first set left off, containing episodes from the remainder of the first season and part of the second season, from March 1953 to November 1953.

<doc id="226863" wikidata="Q463961" url="?curid=226863" title="Hōjō Masako">
<text>was a Japanese politician who exercised significant power in the early years of the Kamakura period, which was reflected by her contemporary sobriquet of the &quot;nun shogun&quot;. She was the wife of Minamoto no Yoritomo, and mother of Minamoto no Yoriie and Minamoto no Sanetomo, the first, second and third shoguns of the Kamakura shogunate, respectively. She was the eldest daughter of Hōjō Tokimasa and sister of Hōjō Yoshitoki, both of them &quot;shikken&quot; of the Kamakura shogunate.

==Early life and marriage (1157–1182)==
 Hōjō Masako (her real name is unknown, she was called Masako after her father&#x27;s name Tokimasa by later researchers) was born in 1157, eldest child of Hōjō Tokimasa, leader of the influential Hōjō clan of Izu province, and his wife, Hōjō no Maki. Masako&#x27;s parents were still in their teens, so she was raised by many ladies-in-waiting and nannies. Masako was born into a world of war and strife. In Kyoto, the capital of Japan, the Hōgen Rebellion was in full swing. Cloistered Emperor Toba and Emperor Sutoku warred over who would be the next emperor. The Hōjō clan wisely chose to stay out of the rebellion, even though the Hōjō family was descended from the Taira clan and thus was related to the imperial family. 

During the Heiji Rebellion in 1159, the Taira clan under Taira no Kiyomori, defeated the Minamoto clan with the support of Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa. Minamoto no Yoshitomo, leader of the Minamoto clan, was executed while his sons and daughters were either executed or sent to nunneries. Of his surviving sons, Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori were forced into priesthood, while Minamoto no Yoritomo, at the age of thirteen, was exiled to Izu in the domain of Hōjō Tokimasa. While this was happening, Masako was barely an infant. The Taira under Kiyomori were from this point on in effective control of Japan.

Masako was the oldest child of fifteen. She was instructed in horseback riding, hunting, fishing, and she ate with men rather than with the women of the household. Her brother, Hōjō Yoshitoki, born in 1163 would eventually become the second Hōjō shikken (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate and head of the Hōjō clan. Another of her brothers, Hōjō Tokifusa, would become a member of the Rokuhara Tandai.

Masako married Yoritomo around 1177, against her father&#x27;s wishes. In 1179, they had their first daughter, Ō-Hime. As Yoritomo&#x27;s wife, she participated in government administration and eventually became a representation of power for the Hōjō clan.

The same year a disillusioned Imperial Prince Mochihito, son of Emperor Go-Shirakawa, called on members of the Minamoto still remaining in Japan to overthrow the Taira. Mochihito thought the Taira had denied him the throne to offer it to Emperor Antoku, who was half Taira. Minamoto no Yoritomo considered himself the head of the Minamoto and responded. He had the full support of the Hōjō and Hōjō Tokimasa, not to mention Masako. The Minamoto center of power was the city of Kamakura, to the east of Izu in Sagami Province. The Genpei War, the final war between Minamoto and Taira had begun.

In 1180, Masako&#x27;s elder brother Munetoki was killed at Battle of Ishibashiyama and Yoshitoki became heir of Hōjō clan. In 1181, Taira no Kiyomori died, leaving the Taira in the hands of his son Taira no Munemori. In 1182, Masako and Yoritomo had their first son, Minamoto no Yoriie.

==The Genpei War and its aftermath (1182–1199)==
In 1183, Yoritomo&#x27;s rival and cousin Minamoto no Yoshinaka took Kyoto, forcing the Taira (and Emperor Antoku) to Shikoku. Soon after, Emperor Go-Toba was installed by the Minamoto. Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori, Yoritomo&#x27;s half brothers who had joined the conflict on his side, drove Yoshinaka out of the capital and executed him, taking Kyoto in the name of Yoritomo (and the Hōjō).

By 1185, the Taira were defeated at the climactic Battle of Dan-no-ura, which ended the war. Munemori was executed, while the remaining Taira were either executed or drowned as they fled, including the young Emperor Antoku. Yoritomo was now the undisputed leader of Japan and his wife Hōjō Masako and her family had stood by her husband through it all.

Yoritomo&#x27;s allegiance to his wife&#x27;s family and her dislike of her brothers-in-law, as well as an internal power struggle brought on by the three brothers, eventually resulted in the arrest and execution of Yoshitsune and Noriyori. Yoritomo bestowed the titles of shugo and jitō on loyal followers to undermine Emperor Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s authority and the central government&#x27;s control in the provinces while Kyoto was relegated to a ceremonial role and power shifted to center around Kamakura.

In 1192, after the death of Go-Shirakawa, Yoritomo proclaimed himself shōgun and took official control over Japan. He was now the undisputed ruler and most powerful man in country. That same year Masako and Yoritomo had another son, Minamoto no Sanetomo.

==Yoritomo&#x27;s death and familial strife (1199–1205)==
In 1199, Minamoto no Yoritomo died. He was succeeded as &quot;shōgun&quot; by his son, Minamoto no Yoriie. Since he was only eighteen, Hōjō Tokimasa proclaimed himself &quot;shikken&quot; or regent for Yoriie. Masako also had a strong position since her son was &quot;shōgun&quot;. Since her husband was dead, she shaved her head and became a Buddhist nun, receiving a tonsure from the priest Gyōyū. However, she did not take up residence in a monastery or a nunnery, and still involved herself in politics. Along with her father Tokimasa and her brother Yoshitoki, Masako created a council of regents for the eighteen-year-old Yoriie. The headstrong &quot;shōgun&quot; hated his mother&#x27;s family and preferred his wife&#x27;s family, the Hiki clan, and his father-in-law, Hiki Yoshikazu.

Hōjō Masako overheard a plot that Yoshikazu and Yoriie were hatching, and turned in her own son to Tokimasa, who did not hurt Yoriie but had Yoshikazu executed in 1203. Now, &quot;Shōgun&quot; Yoriie was very sick and retired to Izu Province. He was murdered in 1204, no doubt by Tokimasa&#x27;s orders. Masako had not been aware of this. During the murders and purges of the Hiki clan, Minamoto no Ichiman, Yoriie&#x27;s eldest son and heir and Masako&#x27;s grandson, was also executed since he was part Hiki himself.

In 1203, Masako&#x27;s other son by Yoritomo, Minamoto no Sanetomo, became the third &quot;shōgun&quot; with Tokimasa as regent. Sanetomo was closer to his mother than his elder brother was, and still a child when appointed &quot;shōgun&quot;, by contrast his brother, who was forced to abdicate as &quot;shōgun&quot; was now an adult. Nonetheless, Masako and Yoshitoki, the heir to the Hōjō, were angry with their father, especially after their mother, Hōjō no Maki, died in 1204. Masako&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband, Hatakeyama Shigetada, was wrongfully executed on Tokimasa&#x27;s orders even after Yoshitoki, Masako, and Tokifusa told Tokimasa he was not guilty of the &quot;treason&quot; charges. Hōjō Tokimasa was by 1205 the most powerful man in Kamakura.

Masako heard rumors that Tokimasa was planning to execute Sanetomo and replace him with one of his allies, so Masako and Yoshitoki immediately ordered Tokimasa to step down and go into priesthood or they would rebel. Hōjō Tokimasa abdicated in 1205, and was sent off to a monastery in Kamakura, where he shaved his head and became a monk, dying in 1215.

==The later years (1205–1225)==

Tokimasa was ousted in 1205 when Minamoto no Sanetomo became &quot;shōgun.&quot; The position of the Hōjō clan was still secure. Masako&#x27;s brother, Hōjō Yoshitoki, succeeded as &quot;shikken&quot; for Sanetomo, and Masako herself remained in a powerful position as a negotiator with the court. In 1218, Masako was awarded the court rank of Junior Second Rank by the imperial government. She continued to work towards the creation of an advisory council. During this time, she was sent by Regent Yoshitoki on a mission to the Cloistered Emperor Go-Toba, to ask if Minamoto no Sanetomo might adopt one of the emperor&#x27;s sons as an heir. The emperor refused.

In 1219, Sanetomo was killed by his nephew Kugyō, son of his murdered elder brother Yoriie. Sanetomo&#x27;s death marked the end of the Minamoto line of &quot;shōguns&quot;. Masako and Hōjō Yoshitoki selected Kujō Yoritsune, known as Fujiwara no Yoritsune, as the next &quot;shōgun&quot;. Because Yoritsune was still an infant, Masako was able to act as de facto &quot;shōgun&quot; until her death. Yoritsune belonged to the Kujō clan (itself part of the Fujiwara clan) but his grandmother was the niece of first &quot;shōgun&quot; Yoritomo. This meant that whilst he was not strictly a member of the Hōjō clan he was still a figurehead for them.

During the Jōkyū War of 1221, Go-Toba rebelled against the Hōjō. Kamakura was greatly upset by that news, but Masako is said to have calmed it down with her celebrated speech to Kamakura vassals. &quot;Azuma Kagami&quot;, the official chronicle of the Kamakura shogunate, tells that Masako summoned the vassals and had these words delivered to them by Adachi Kagemori, the Vice-Governor of Akita Fortress:

Regent Yoshitoki and his eldest son, Hōjō Yasutoki, responded to the rebellion by regaining Kyoto,resulting in the exile of Go-Toba. Masako continued to consolidate rule under the advisory council, manage relationships and connections between imperial and aristocratic families, and administer judgments and postwar rewards. In an era that acknowledged the authority and legitimacy of women in rule, Masako&#x27;s dominance enabled the Hōjō clan to dominate the Kamakura Shogunate until the downfall of the government in 1333.

Hōjō Masako died in 1225 at the age of 69. Due to her lifestyle of cloistered rule, she was known as the &quot;ama-shōgun&quot;, or the &quot;nun-&quot;shōgun&quot;&quot;. &quot;Azuma Kagami&quot; portrayed her as a peer of Empress Lü in China and Empress Jingū of Japan.

<text>As originally stated in terms of direct-current resistive circuits only, Thévenin&#x27;s theorem states that &quot;Any linear electrical network containing only voltage sources, current sources and resistances can be replaced at terminals by an equivalent combination of a voltage source in a series connection with a resistance .&quot;

* The equivalent voltage is the voltage obtained at terminals of the network with terminals open circuited.
* The equivalent resistance is the resistance that the circuit between terminals and would have if all ideal voltage sources in the circuit were replaced by a short circuit and all ideal current sources were replaced by an open circuit (i.e., the sources are set to provide zero voltages and currents).
* If terminals and are connected to one another (short), then the current flowing from and will be formula_1 according to the Thévenin equivalent circuit. This means that could alternatively be calculated as divided by the short-circuit current between and when they are connected together.

In circuit theory terms, the theorem allows any one-port network to be reduced to a single voltage source and a single impedance.

The theorem also applies to frequency domain AC circuits consisting of reactive (inductive and capacitive) and resistive impedances. It means the theorem applies for AC in an exactly same way to DC except that resistances are generalized to impedances.

The theorem was independently derived in 1853 by the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1883 by Léon Charles Thévenin (1857–1926), an electrical engineer with France&#x27;s national Postes et Télégraphes telecommunications organization.

Thévenin&#x27;s theorem and its dual, Norton&#x27;s theorem, are widely used to make circuit analysis simpler and to study a circuit&#x27;s initial-condition and steady-state response. Thévenin&#x27;s theorem can be used to convert any circuit&#x27;s sources and impedances to a Thévenin equivalent; use of the theorem may in some cases be more convenient than use of Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws.

==A proof of the theorem==

Various proofs have been given of Thévenin&#x27;s theorem. Perhaps the simplest of these was the proof in Thévenin&#x27;s original paper. Not only is that proof elegant and easy to understand, but a consensus exists that Thévenin&#x27;s proof is both correct and general in its applicability. The proof goes as follows:

Consider an active network containing impedances, (constant-) voltage sources and (constant-) current sources. The configuration of the network can be anything. Access to the network is provided by a pair of terminals. Designate the voltage measured between the terminals as , as shown in the box on the left side of Figure 2.

Suppose that the voltage sources within the box are replaced by short circuits, and the current sources by open circuits. If this is done, no voltage appears across the terminals, and it is possible to measure the impedance between the terminals. Call this impedance .

Now suppose that one attaches some linear network to the terminals of the box, having impedance , as in Figure 2a. We wish to find the current through . The answer is not obvious, since the terminal voltage will not be after is connected.

Instead, we imagine that we attach, in series with impedance , a source with electromotive force equal to but directed to oppose , as shown in Figure 2b. No current will then flow through since balances .

Next, we insert another source of electromotive force, , in series with , where has the same magnitude as but is opposed in direction (see Figure 2c). The current, , can be determined as follows: it is the current that would result from acting alone, with all other sources (within the active network and the external network) set to zero. This current is, therefore, 

formula_2 

because is the impedance external to the box and looking into the box when its sources are zero.

Finally, we note that and can be removed together without changing the current, and when they are removed, we are back to Figure 2a. Therefore, is the current, , that we are seeking, i.e.

formula_3

thus, completing the proof. Figure 2d shows the Thévenin equivalent circuit.

==Helmholtz&#x27;s proof==
As noted, Thévenin&#x27;s theorem was first discovered and published by the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz in 1853, four years before Thévenin&#x27;s birth. Thévenin&#x27;s 1883 proof, described above, is nearer in spirit to modern methods of electrical engineering, and this may explain why his name is more commonly associated with the theorem. Helmholtz&#x27;s earlier formulation of the problem reflects a more general approach that is closer to physics. 

In his 1853 paper, Helmholtz was concerned with the electromotive properties of &quot;physically extensive conductors&quot;, in particular, with animal tissue. He noted that earlier work by physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond had shown that &quot;every smallest part of a muscle that can be stimulated is capable of producing electrical currents.&quot; At this time, experiments were carried out by attaching a galvanometer at two points to a sample of animal tissue and measuring current flow through the external circuit. Since the goal of this work was to understand something about the internal properties of the tissue, Helmholtz wanted to find a way to relate those internal properties to the currents measured externally.

Helmholtz&#x27;s starting point was a result published by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1848. Like Helmholtz, Kirchhoff was concerned with three-dimensional, electrically conducting systems. Kirchhoff considered a system consisting of two parts, which he labelled parts A and B. Part A (which played the part of the &quot;active network&quot; in Fig. 2 above) consisted of a collection of conducting bodies connected end to end, each body characterized by an electromotive force and a resistance. Part B was assumed to be connected to the endpoints of A via two wires. Kirchhoff then showed (p. 195) that &quot;without changing the flow at any point in B, one can substitute for A a conductor in which an electromotive force is located which is equal to the sum of the voltage differences in A, and which has a resistance equal to the summed resistances of the elements of A&quot;.

In his 1853 paper, Helmholtz acknowledged Kirchhoff&#x27;s result, but noted that it was only valid in the case that, &quot;as in hydroelectric batteries&quot;, there are no closed current curves in A, but rather that all such curves pass through B. He therefore set out to generalize Kirchhoff&#x27;s result to the case of an arbitrary, three-dimensional distribution of currents and voltage sources within system A. 

Helmholtz began by providing a more general formulation than had previously been published of the superposition principle, which he expressed (p. 212-213) as follows:

If any system of conductors contains electromotive forces at various locations, the electrical voltage at every point in the system through which the current flows is equal to the algebraic sum of those voltages which each of the electromotive forces would produce independently of the others. And similarly, the components of the current intensity that are parallel to three perpendicular axes are equal to the sum of the corresponding components that belong to the individual forces.

Using this theorem, as well as Ohm&#x27;s law, Helmholtz proved the following three theorems about the relation between the internal voltages and currents of &quot;physical&quot; system A, and the current flowing through the &quot;linear&quot; system B, which was assumed to be attached to A at two points on its surface:
From these, Helmholtz derived his final result (p. 222):

If a physical conductor with constant electromotive forces in two specific points on its surface is connected to any linear conductor, then in its place one can always substitute a linear conductor with a certain electromotive force and a certain resistance, which in all applied linear conductors would excite exactly the same currents as the physical one. ... The resistance of the linear conductor to be substituted is equal to that of the body when a current is passed through it from the two entry points of the linear conductor.

He then noted that his result, derived for a general &quot;physical system&quot;, also applied to &quot;linear&quot; (in a geometric sense) circuits like those considered by Kirchhoff:

What applies to every physical conductor also applies to the special case of a branched linear current system. Even if two specific points of such a system are connected to any other linear conductors, it behaves compared to them like a linear conductor of certain resistance, the magnitude of which can be found according to the well-known rules for branched lines, and of certain electromotive force, which is given by the voltage difference of the derived points as it existed before the added circuit.

This formulation of the theorem is essentially the same as Thévenin&#x27;s, published 30 years later.

== Calculating the Thévenin equivalent ==
The Thévenin-equivalent circuit of a linear electrical circuit is a voltage source with voltage in series with a resistance .

The Thévenin-equivalent voltage is the open-circuit voltage at the output terminals of the original circuit. When calculating a Thévenin-equivalent voltage, the voltage divider principle is often useful, by declaring one terminal to be and the other terminal to be at the ground point.

The Thévenin-equivalent resistance is the resistance measured across points and &quot;looking back&quot; into the circuit. The resistance is measured after replacing all voltage- and current-sources with their internal resistances. That means an ideal voltage source is replaced with a short circuit, and an ideal current source is replaced with an open circuit. Resistance can then be calculated across the terminals using the formulae for series and parallel circuits. This method is valid only for circuits with independent sources. If there are dependent sources in the circuit, another method must be used such as connecting a test source across and and calculating the voltage across or current through the test source.

As a mnemonic, the Thevenin replacements for voltage and current sources can be remembered as the sources&#x27; values (meaning their voltage or current) are set to zero. A zero valued voltage source would create a potential difference of zero volts between its terminals, just like an ideal short circuit would do, with two leads touching; therefore the source is replaced with a short circuit. Similarly, a zero valued current source and an &quot;open&quot; circuit both pass zero current.

===Example===
In the example, calculating the equivalent voltage:formula_4(Notice that is not taken into consideration, as above calculations are done in an open-circuit condition between and , therefore no current flows through this part, which means there is no current through and therefore no voltage drop along this part.)

Calculating equivalent resistance ( is the total resistance of two parallel resistors):formula_5

==Conversion to a Norton equivalent==

A Norton equivalent circuit is related to the Thévenin equivalent byformula_6

==Practical limitations==
* Many circuits are only linear over a certain range of values, thus the Thévenin equivalent is valid only within this linear range.
* The Thévenin equivalent has the equivalent I–V characteristic of an original circuit only from the point of view of a load connecting to the circuit.
* The power dissipation of the Thévenin equivalent is not necessarily identical to the power dissipation of the real system. However, the power dissipated by an external resistor between the two output terminals is the same regardless of how the internal circuit is implemented.

==In three-phase circuits==

In 1933, A. T. Starr published a generalization of Thévenin&#x27;s theorem in an article of the magazine &quot;Institute of Electrical Engineers Journal&quot;, titled &quot;A New Theorem for Active Networks&quot;, which states that any three-terminal active linear network can be substituted by three voltage sources with corresponding impedances, connected in wye or in delta.

<text>A khlong (, ), alternatively spelt as klong () commonly refers to a canal in Thailand. These canals are spawned by the rivers Chao Phraya, Tha Chin, and Mae Klong, along with their tributaries particularly in the low-lying areas of central Thailand. The Thai word &quot;khlong&quot; is not limited to artificial canals. Many smaller rivers are referred to as &quot;khlong&quot; followed by the name of the stream.

==Khlongs in Bangkok==
 there are 1,682 canals in Bangkok, totalling 2,604 kilometres in length. Nine canals are primary flood drainage conduits.

In years past, the Thai capital was crisscrossed by khlongs, and so gained the nickname &quot;Venice of the East&quot;. Khlongs were used for transportation, for floating markets, but also for sewage disposal. Today, most of the khlongs of Bangkok have been filled in, although the Thonburi side of Bangkok (covering areas west of the Chao Phraya River) still retains several of its larger khlongs.

Khlong Saen Saep in central Bangkok is a significant thoroughfare in traffic-congested Bangkok&#x27;s public transportation network.

==Floating markets==
Traditional floating markets now exist mainly as tourist attractions. The best-known is the Damnoen Saduak floating market in Ratchaburi Province.

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1563.

==Events==

*February 12–14 – The French poet Pierre de Bocosel de Chastelard is twice caught hiding under the bed of Mary, Queen of Scots – at Holyrood and then at Rossend. He is arrested by the Earl of Moray on his second attempt and executed at St Andrews Castle on February 22.
*March 27 – As part of the English Reformation, the House of Commons passes legislation approving Bible translations into Welsh. This allows Henry Denham to publish his Welsh New Testament in 1567.
*c. April – A year into the French Wars of Religion, Pierre de Ronsard composes two defenses of French Catholicism against the Huguenots. On the Huguenot side, anonymous leaflets parody his &quot;remonstrance&quot; genre until a ban on libels is placed by Charles IX of France.
*April – As a hostage at Iperoig in Tupi territory, José de Anchieta composes &quot;De Beata Virgine Dei Matre&quot; (The Blessed Virgin Mary), a devotional poem that is among the early accomplishments in Brazilian literature.
*April 3 – From the Electoral Palatinate, Caspar Olevian reports to John Calvin that the &quot;Heidelberg Catechism&quot; will be ready &quot;by next market day&quot;. The contributors, including Olevian, Zacharias Ursinus, and Calvin himself, are not mentioned in print, &quot;so that the Germans would not refuse to read it.&quot;
*May – The Ottoman poet and historian Mustafa Âlî accepts a post in Aleppo Eyalet. On his way there he visits his mentor, Ramazanoğlu Piri Mehmet Paşa, in Adana.
*June 27 – Gómez Suárez de Figueroa fails to return to his native Peru from Seville. After November, he begins signing his name &quot;Garcilaso de la Vega&quot;, a step toward &quot;Inca Garcilaso de la Vega&quot;, his literary signature.
*August – Michel de Montaigne writes a letter to his father describing the death of his friend Étienne de La Boétie.
*c. September/November – In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł commissions the &quot;Brest Bible&quot; from various translators, as the first complete translation into Polish. It becomes the standard edition for the Polish Lutheran and Reformed churches.
*November 5 – Outside Suceava, Moldavia, Prince Iacob Heraclid, a Renaissance humanist, is lynched by crowds after a siege; the rival pretender, Ștefan Tomșa, probably delivers the first blow.
*December – Primož Trubar of the South Slavic Bible Institute draws up a plan to sustain the Reformation in Italy with translations from Martin Luther.
*December 4 – The closure of the Council of Trent marks the official start of the Counter-Reformation and encouragement of artistic Mannerism, which sometimes extended to literature. Though its full impact is delayed to 1587, it is visible in the Republic of Venice: by 1567, most books put out by Gabriele Giolito de&#x27; Ferrari are devotional.
*At Basel in the Old Swiss Confederacy, the Dutch physician Johann Weyer publishes &quot;De praestigiis daemonum&quot;, with its rationalist interpretation of witchcraft. It proposes that accused witches are &quot;deluded victims&quot; rather than instruments of the Devil. Though rejected by &quot;witch-hunters&quot;, &quot;De praestigiis&quot; sells well and will inspire Reginald Scot&#x27;s refutation of magic. Also in Basel, Pietro Perna prints Bernardino Ochino&#x27;s &quot;Dialogi XXX&quot; (Thirty Dialogues) criticizing the Radical Reformation. Their apparent preaching of polygamy is used against him by the &quot;Daig&quot;, causing him and his family to be banished from the city.
*John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;, known later as &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;, becomes &quot;the most influential book&quot; of the Elizabethan era &quot;upon the formation of English Protestant identity and nationhood.&quot;
*Printing is brought to Goa and Portuguese India, probably by the Society of Jesus, producing Garcia de Orta&#x27;s &quot;Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India&quot;. With its rhyming preface by Luís de Camões, it is &quot;the third [book] in a European language to be printed in Asia.&quot;
*The future John of the Cross is tonsured a Carmelite at Medina del Campo in the Crown of Castile.
*In the Kingdom of Poland, Stanisław Orzechowski publishes &quot;Rozmowa, albo Dyjalog około egzekucyjej polskiej korony&quot; (Conversation, or a Dialogue about Government of the Polish Crown), with allegorical engravings and designs resembling hieroglyphs. It defends the Catholic Church in Poland as an ideal political model, so marking Orzechowski&#x27;s own transition from Lutheranism.

<text>The Sublime Porte, also known as the Ottoman Porte or High Porte ( or &quot;Babıali&quot;; ), was a synecdoche or metaphor used to refer collectively to the central government of the Ottoman Empire in Istanbul. It particularly referred to the building which housed the office of the Grand Vizier, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the Interior, and the Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances. Today it houses the office of the Istanbul govornerate.

==History==

The name has its origins in the old practice in which the ruler announced his official decisions and judgements at the gate of his palace. This was the practice in the Byzantine Empire and it was also adopted by Ottoman Turk sultans since Orhan I. The palace of the sultan, or the gate leading to it, therefore became known as the &quot;High Gate&quot;. This name referred first to a palace in Bursa, Turkey. After the Ottomans had conquered Constantinople, now Istanbul, the gate now known as the Imperial Gate (), leading to the outermost courtyard of the Topkapı Palace, first became known as the &quot;High Gate&quot;, or the &quot;Sublime Porte&quot;.

When Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent sealed an alliance with King Francis I of France in 1536, the French diplomats walked through the monumental gate then known as &quot;Bab-ı Ali&quot; (now &quot;Bâb-ı Hümâyûn&quot;) in order to reach the Vizierate of Constantinople, seat of the Sultan&#x27;s government. French being the language of diplomacy, the French translation &quot;Sublime Porte&quot; was soon adopted in most other European languages, including English, to refer not only to the actual gate but as a metonymy for the Ottoman Empire.

In the 18th century, a new great Italian-styled office building was built just west of Topkapı Palace area, on the other side of Alemdar Caddesi (Alemdar street). This became the location of the Grand Vizier and many ministries. Thereafter, this building, and the monumental gate leading to its courtyards, became known as the Sublime Porte (&quot;Bab-ı Ali&quot;); colloquially it was also known as the Gate of the Pasha (&quot;paşa kapusu&quot;). The building was rebuilt following a fire in 1839, and badly damaged by another fire in 1911. Today, the buildings house the Istanbul Governor&#x27;s Office.

==Diplomacy==
&quot;Sublime Porte&quot; was used in the context of diplomacy by Western states, as their diplomats were received at the &quot;porte&quot; (meaning &quot;gate&quot;). During the Second Constitutional Era of the Empire after 1908 (see Young Turk Revolution), the functions of the classical Divan-ı Hümayun were replaced by the reformed Imperial Government, and &quot;porte&quot; came to refer to the Foreign Ministry. During this period, the office of the Grand Vizier came to refer to the equivalent to that of a prime minister, and viziers became members of the Grand Vizier&#x27;s cabinet as government ministers.

* Court of St James&#x27;s, another synecdochic term, for the United Kingdom in diplomatic relations

<text>The 2001–02 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Barclaycard]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the tenth season of the competition. It began with a new sponsor, Barclaycard, and was titled the FA Barclaycard Premiership, replacing the previous sponsor, Carling. The title race turned into a battle among four sides – Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle United.

Arsenal clinched the title on 8 May 2002 after a convincing win against Manchester United at Old Trafford, in the penultimate game of the season. This new attacking Arsenal side had won the FA Cup five days before and made history by accomplishing their third double, their second under the reign of Arsène Wenger, who showed his commitment by signing a new four-year deal with Arsenal.

The season started on 18 August 2001 and ended on 11 May 2002.

==Season summary==
At the start of 2002 the title race was wide open, with the likes of Newcastle United and Leeds United contesting at the top of the table along with the usual likes of Arsenal and Manchester United. Newcastle, after back-to-back away wins at Arsenal and Leeds during the Christmas period, confirmed themselves as genuine title challengers and led the league at the turn of the year. Leeds had topped the table at Christmas prior to losing at Elland Road to Newcastle.

Despite being top of the table at the start of December – eleven points clear of Manchester United – Liverpool underwent a severe slump, falling to fifth place, five points behind United. Would-be contenders Chelsea, Newcastle United and Leeds United had by this point disappeared into the chasing pack.

January saw Liverpool travelling to both Highbury and Old Trafford in the space of a fortnight. Liverpool&#x27;s Danny Murphy scored a late winner to give the Merseyside club all three points against United, and John Arne Riise then salvaged a point for Liverpool against Arsenal, allowing Manchester United to top the table for the first time that season.

In March, Arsenal were installed as strong favourites for the Premiership title after Liverpool&#x27;s defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Arsenal&#x27;s April triumph against Bolton Wanderers brought them to within three points of a second Premier League title under Arsène Wenger.

Fittingly, the Premiership title would be decided at Old Trafford as Arsenal and Manchester United faced one another in a decisive encounter. Arsenal only required a draw to guarantee their second title in five seasons to go with their FA Cup victory against London rivals Chelsea four days previously; United had to win to take the title race to the last day. In the end, Arsenal emerged victorious as their record signing Sylvain Wiltord scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal was confirmed Premiership champions with a game to spare. Manchester United&#x27;s disappointment was compounded by Liverpool leapfrogging them into second place by virtue of their 4–3 victory against Blackburn Rovers.

On the final day of the season Liverpool confirmed second place, and in doing so, gaining automatic qualification to the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, by thrashing Ipswich Town 5–0 at Anfield. Arsenal rounded off their successful league campaign in style, beating Everton 4–3 at Highbury. Manchester United limped to a poor draw against Charlton Athletic, completing a disappointing campaign for the deposed league champions, the first time since the Premiership had been formed that they had finished out of the top two places and they were required to play in the qualifying rounds of the Champions League the following season.

Newcastle joined Manchester United in those Champions League qualifying rounds by finishing in fourth, whilst a poor run of results at the beginning of the year saw Leeds United&#x27;s title and Champions League hopes crumble, they were to finish five points adrift of Newcastle in fifth, and would be joined in the UEFA Cup by Chelsea, whose inconsistent form also put pay to their top four aspirations. Leeds controversially sacked their manager David O&#x27;Leary after the season concluded.

For the first time in the history of the Premier League, all three promoted teams avoided relegation – Fulham, Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers. Blackburn and Bolton spent eleven years in the Premier League, before they were both relegated in 2011–12; coincidentally, in that same season, the three teams promoted from the 2010–11 Football League Championship also stayed up. Fulham spent thirteen years in the top flight before their relegation in 2013–14.

Fulham had splashed out £34 million on new players during the close season, with their owner Mohamed Al-Fayed being one of the wealthiest benefactors in English football. He even boasted that they would win the Premiership title in 2001–02, and most pundits tipped Fulham, managed by former French international Jean Tigana, to push for a place in Europe. However, Fulham finished thirteenth, 47 points away from Arsenal.

Bolton Wanderers went top of the Premiership after winning their first three fixtures of the season, causing an upset by beating Gérard Houllier&#x27;s Liverpool in the latter stage of the game. Manager Sam Allardyce was boasting that his side were good enough to win their first ever league title, but Bolton&#x27;s league form slumped after the first two months of the season and they finished 16th place – their survival confirmed in the penultimate game of the season.

Blackburn Rovers were the most successful of the promoted sides. Graeme Souness&#x27; men beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 in the League Cup final to lift the trophy for the first time, and then climbed from 18th place in the Premiership in late February to finish in a secure 10th place – higher than any other newly promoted team that season. Blackburn secured a UEFA Cup place for 2002–03.

Leicester City was the first team officially relegated from the Premiership, finishing bottom of table with just five Premiership wins in their last season at 111-year-old Filbert Street before relocation to the new 32 000-seat Walkers Stadium. The club went through the regime of two managers during the season – Peter Taylor was replaced by Dave Bassett in early October. Under Bassett, the Foxes briefly climbed out of the relegation zone but a 16-match winless streak including six straight defeats between late January and the beginning of March ultimately sealed their fate. After relegation was confirmed at the beginning of April, Bassett joined the club&#x27;s board to be replaced by former assistant manager Micky Adams.

Next to go down were Derby County, who had been promoted alongside Leicester six years earlier. Manager Jim Smith resigned in early October to be replaced by assistant manager Colin Todd, who was sacked three months later after Derby were knocked out of the FA Cup by Division Three strugglers Bristol Rovers. In his place came John Gregory, less than a week after he had resigned from Aston Villa but despite his best efforts, he was unable to prevent their relegation, which was confirmed with two games to spare following a 2–0 loss away at Liverpool.

The last team to be relegated were Ipswich Town, who had qualified for the UEFA Cup and earned manager George Burley the Manager of the Year award the previous season after finishing fifth. Ipswich made a terrible start to the season, winning just one of their first 18 Premiership games. They then went on a strong run of form, winning seven out of eight games, which looked to have secured their Premiership survival, but they then suffered another slump which they were unable to halt. Coincidentally, like Derby, they too were sent down by losing away at Liverpool, who thrashed them 5–0 on the final day. Bizarrely, despite their relegation, Ipswich&#x27;s disciplinary record this season was the best of the teams that hadn&#x27;t qualified for European competition via league position, thus giving them a second successive UEFA Cup campaign for the following season after England received one of the three additional slots awarded through the UEFA Fair Play ranking.

==Teams==
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Fulham, Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers, returning after a top flight absence of thirty-three, two and three years respectively. This was also Fulham&#x27;s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Manchester City, Coventry City, and Bradford City, who were relegated to the First Division after their presences of one, thirty-four and two-year top flight spells respectively.

<text>The American Baptist Churches USA (ABCUSA) is a Baptist Christian denomination established in 1907 as the Northern Baptist Convention, and named the American Baptist Convention from 1950 to 1972. Tracing its history to the First Baptist Church in America (1638) and the Baptist congregational associations which organized the Triennial Convention in 1814, the ABCUSA is headquartered in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. 

Although the denomination is often considered mainline, varying theological and missional emphases may be found among its congregations, including modernist, charismatic and conservative evangelical orientations.

==History==
===Colonial New England Baptists===
American Baptist Churches USA have their origins in the First Baptist Church in Providence, Rhode Island, now the First Baptist Church in America, founded in 1638 by the minister Roger Williams. Regarded by the more dogmatic Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a heretic for his religious separatism, Williams was banished into the New England wilderness where he and his followers created the settlement of Providence and later, the colony of Rhode Island. Williams is credited with being the founder of the Baptist movement in America, the founder of the state of Rhode Island, and the first highly visible public leader in America to call for the separation of church and state.
===Triennial Convention===
Having a congregational polity, early Baptist churches in America operated independently from one another, following an array of Protestant theological paths, but were often unified in their mission to evangelize. In the 18th century, they sometimes created local congregational associations for support, fellowship, and work (such as the founding of Brown University in 1764). The evangelical mission led to the establishment of the national Triennial Convention in 1814, a collaborative effort by local churches to organize, fund, and deploy missionaries. The ABCUSA descends from this Triennial Convention. Through the Triennial Convention structure a number of mission-oriented societies were formed, including the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (1814), American Baptist Home Mission Society (1832), American Baptist Publication Society (1841), and the American Baptist Education Society (1888).

In 1845, a majority of Baptists in the South withdrew support from the Triennial Convention—largely in response to the decision of its delegates to ban slave holders from becoming ordained missionaries—and formed the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). The Triennial Convention was loosely structured, and the SBC offered Baptists a more centralized organizational structure for carrying on missionary and benevolent work. In contrast, however, the Triennial Convention afforded local churches a higher degree of local autonomy, a more traditional characteristic of Baptist polity. The majority of churches in the North continued to work through these separate cooperating societies for missions and benevolence.

In 1882, May Jones became the first ordained woman minister in the convention.

===Northern Baptist Convention===
The Northern Baptist Convention was founded in Washington, D.C., on May 17, 1907. Charles Evans Hughes, then Governor of New York and later Chief Justice of the United States, served the body as its first president.

The purpose of the Northern Baptist Convention was to bring about a consistent cooperation among the separate Baptist bodies then existing. It was the first step in bringing together Baptists in the North &quot;with ties to the historic American Baptist mission societies in the nineteenth century.&quot; These had contributed to establishing many schools for freedmen in the South after the American Civil War, as well as working on issues of health and welfare. Many of their missionaries and members had worked as teachers in the South. In 1911, most of the churches of the Free Will Baptist General Conference merged with it.

Due to the development of theological liberalism in some affiliated seminaries, such as Crozer Theological Seminary, conservative seminaries have been founded by convention pastors, including the Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in Chicago in 1913 and the Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Philadelphia in 1925.

===American Baptist Convention===

The name of the convention was changed in 1950 to the American Baptist Convention (ABC), and it operated under this name until 1972. It was the second step at bringing together on a national level Baptists with ties to the mission societies. The ABC was characterized from 1950 to 1966 with annual resolutions at its conventions having to do with the civil rights movement and race relations.
As in many cases, the rhetoric of the annual conventions was sometimes ahead of local activity, but the denomination gradually made progress. In 1964, it created the Baptist Action for Racial Brotherhood (BARB), which early the next year produced a pamphlet outlining actions for change in local churches. In 1968, the national convention was challenged by &quot;Black American Baptist Churchmen Speak To the American Baptist Convention,&quot; demands that challenged how the denomination had &quot;conducted its business relative to black American Baptists.&quot;

The black churchmen said the convention had excluded them from decision-making positions, even while working with good intentions on behalf of black American Baptists. The following year, Dr. Thomas Kilgore Jr., pastor of the Second Baptist Church of Los Angeles, was elected the first black president of the convention. The 1968 convention also voted to create the Study Commission on Denominational Structure (SCODS). Its recommendations changed the denomination in a variety of ways, after being adopted at the 1972 convention.

===American Baptist Churches USA===
To reflect its new structure, the convention in 1972 changed its name to the American Baptist Churches USA. Rather than relying on decision-making at the annual convention by whichever churches happened to send delegates, the SCODS restructuring resulted in the following:
==Governance==
The American Baptists Churches USA has a congregationalist polity emphasizing local church autonomy. Local churches are organized into 33 regions; the ABCUSA General Board makes policy for the denomination&#x27;s national agencies.

However, board resolutions are not binding on local congregations. Three-fourths of the representatives to the ABCUSA General Board are nominated and elected by the regions. One-fourth of the representatives are nominated by the ABCUSA Nominating Committee and are elected by the regions. The General Secretary of the ABCUSA executes the policies and decisions of the General Board. Rev. Dr. Lee B. Spitzer was called as ABCUSA General Secretary on May 8, 2017.

A substantial portion of the ABCUSA consists of historically and predominantly African American churches that may have joint affiliations with the ABCUSA and historic bodies such as the National Baptist Convention or the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City is one of the many African American churches jointly affiliated with the ABCUSA and National Baptist Convention. Since 1970, the ABCUSA and Progressive National Baptists have officially partnered.

=== Regions ===
The ABCUSA consists of 33 regional associations and conventions:

==Statistics==
The majority of the denomination&#x27;s congregations are concentrated in the Midwest and Northeast United States.

In 1925, there were just over 1.4 million members. Membership peaked in the early 1980s at around 1.6 million. Since the beginning of the 21st century, membership began to decline and stagnate again, with the ABCUSA reporting 1,145,647 members in 5,057 churches at the end of 2017. According to a census published by the denomination in 2024, it claimed 4,802 churches and 1,107,206 members.

According to a study by the Pew Research Center in 2014, 21% of its members were aged 18–29; 28% 30–49; 32% aged 50–64 and 19% aged 65 and older. While 51% of its membership were Baby Boomers, the Silent Generation, and the Greatest Generation, the remainder were Generation X, older millennials, and younger millennials, making it slightly younger than the National Baptist Convention and Southern Baptist Convention. Approximately 40% of its membership were men and 60% were women, and the ABCUSA&#x27;s churches were 73% non-Hispanic white, 10% non-Hispanic black or African American, 1% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latino American, and 5% multiracial or other.

Theologically, the Pew Research Center&#x27;s 2014 study determined 83% of the ABCUSA believes in God with absolute certainty, and 15% believed fairly certainly; 73% believed religion was very important and 24% considered it somewhat important. About 42% of members attended churches at least once a week, while 41% attended once or twice a month; 16% seldom or never attend church. An estimated 69% prayed daily, and 19% prayed weekly. Among its membership, 48% read Scripture at least once a week, and 15% once or twice a month; 53% believe the Bible should be taken literally, while 27% believe it is still the Word of God, yet shouldn&#x27;t be taken completely literally.

==Beliefs==
Several congregations of the American Baptist Churches USA affirm the historic New Hampshire Confession of Faith. American Baptists believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God and the final authority in matters of faith. The ABCUSA affirms the Trinity, that the one God exists as three persons in complete unity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. They confess Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord through whom those who believe can have fellowship with God. He died, taking on the sins of the world, and was resurrected, triumphing over sin and death.

ABCUSA churches recognize two ordinances: believer&#x27;s baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Baptism is by immersion, and those being baptized must be of an age to understand its significance. Believing in the priesthood of all believers, the ABCUSA avoids using creeds, affirming the freedom of individual Christians and local churches to interpret scripture as the Holy Spirit leads them. The ABCUSA affirms the ordination of women.

=== LGBTQ and same-sex marriages ===
Homosexual issues have been a point of contention in the ABCUSA since the 1987 Biennial Meeting. In 1992, the ABCUSA General Board adopted a resolution that stated, &quot;We affirm that the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.&quot;

Since 1995, regional conventions of the church have carried out excommunications of various churches which have become members of the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists founded in 1993, an association favorable to the inclusion of homosexuals, a belief contrary to a resolution adopted by the denomination.

So far, at least seven regions in the ABCUSA (Evergreen, Wisconsin, Rochester-Genesee, Metro Chicago, Metropolitan New York, Massachusetts, and Philadelphia) support full inclusion of homosexuals into Baptist life. Many ABCUSA churches have also partnered with the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists, which formed at the 1993 Biennial Meeting.

However, several other ABCUSA regions and churches have opposed affirmation of homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgender identity. In 2004, the ABC Central Region reaffirmed the 1992 resolution. At its 2005 annual meeting, the West Virginia Baptist Convention, which had a history of proposing resolutions opposing liberal views on homosexual inclusion, narrowly rejected a proposal to withdraw from the ABCUSA over its refusal to discipline those regions that have supported homosexual-friendly policies. The Indiana-Kentucky region has also proposed a change in the denomination&#x27;s bylaws that would prohibit the transfer of churches into another region if removed from the region because of the issue of homosexuality.

In 2006, American Baptist Churches of the Pacific Southwest split from the convention due to the convention&#x27;s laxity with churches on enforcing a 1992 resolution that opposes the inclusion of homosexual people and have been renamed Transformation Ministries. The convention responded that it wanted to respect the autonomy of local churches and that it did not want to carry out excommunications.

Each local congregation is autonomous and permitted to perform same-sex marriages if they opt to do so. For example, Calvary Baptist Church (Washington, D.C.), affiliated with the ABCUSA, performs same-sex marriages. In 2013, an ABCUSA congregation in Washington, DC, ordained the denomination&#x27;s first openly transgender pastor.

The ABCUSA has consistently allowed each congregation to determine whether or not to perform same-sex marriages, or ordain LGBT clergy. The ABCUSA General Board voted in 2005 to amend the declaration &quot;We are American Baptists&quot; to define marriage as &quot;between one man and one woman&quot; and maintain that &quot;the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Biblical teaching.&quot; However, the denomination has never officially adopted the board&#x27;s statement, and has also stated, &quot;We respect and will continue to respect congregational freedom on this issue&quot;.

== Schools ==

The ABCUSA has 16 affiliated universities and colleges affiliated with it, and a number of home and foreign missionary societies such as the American Baptist Home Mission Society and International Ministries. Among its universities and colleges, some are also dually-affiliated with the National Baptists—a predominantly African American or Black Baptist denomination founded by freedmen and slaves. Additionally, there are 10 seminaries affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA:

<doc id="226926" wikidata="Q7943483" url="?curid=226926" title="Vulcan FlipStart">
<text>The Vulcan FlipStart was a super compact PC, weighing 1.5 pounds (with standard high capacity battery) and the size of a paperback novel (4.5 by 5.9 by 1.6 inches with high capacity battery). FlipStart was the release name for the concept PC Paul Allen showed at CES 2003 and 2004, specifically FlipStart V1.0. The original concept name was Mini-PC.

Its main competition at the time of release was the OQO Model 02. OQO had released the Model 01 at the time the FlipStart was announced 4 years earlier. They were both equipped with QWERTY keyboards and wireless capabilities but the FlipStart was a clamshell (flipped open) versus the OQO which slid up to reveal the keyboard.

== Specifications ==
The FlipStart has a folding 5.9-inch screen with 1024×700 resolution, a 30GB hard drive, built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and batteries capable of running one to three hours on a charge, with extended battery life offering up to four hours. The CPU is a Pentium M ULV processor running at 1.1 GHz, and it has a non-expandable memory of 512MiB. The chipset is the Intel GMA915. A VGA resolution (640 x 480) camera is built in below the screen. The FlipStart also has built in speakers and a microphone.

The devices run the Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems and as such can run standard PC applications such as Microsoft Office.
It also has a small secondary color display in the lid similar to, but not, Windows SideShow. This is only compatible with Office/Outlook 2003 currently. Its small QWERTY keyboard has backlit buttons, and additional input devices are provided in the form of a touchpad and thumbstick located above the keyboard, a scrollwheel and media navigation buttons on the right side of the unit.

Expansion is possible via a dock connector which connects to a port replicator, offering two USB ports (blocking the single port on the unit), VGA, audio, AC power and Ethernet. A sliding cover on the lid provides access to a &quot;snap on&quot; expansion system. There is one expansion option provided for this, a 3.2Mp (5Mp marketed) add-on camera. The expansion cover also provides access to the built in SIM socket.

== Launch ==
The FlipStart was launched in the US on March 27, 2007 at the FlipStart web page for a price of $1999.
The FlipStart (CE marked version) was launched in the UK via distributor Blazepoint on September 10, 2007, for £1449 (excluding VAT).
The US price was reduced to $1499 in September 2007. On January 16, 2008, this price was reduced to $699 (£339.00 ex. VAT in the UK).
In the US the FlipStart primarily shipped with Sierra Sprint Broadband EVDO communications.

In Spring of 2008, FlipStart sold out and no new units were manufactured. The company provided support for one year after that, stopping on March 31, 2009 &quot;due to the low volume of support request and expiration of all warranties.&quot;

<text>Cobra is the common name of various venomous snakes, most of which belong to the genus &quot;Naja&quot;.

Many cobras are capable of rearing upwards and producing a hood when threatened.

==Other snakes known as &quot;cobras&quot;==
While the members of the genus &quot;Naja&quot; constitute the true cobras, the name &quot;cobra&quot; is also applied to these other genera and species:

* The rinkhals, ringhals or ring-necked spitting cobra (&quot;Hemachatus haemachatus&quot;) so-called for its neck band as well as its habit of rearing upwards and producing a hood when threatened
* The king cobra or hamadryad (&quot;Ophiophagus hannah&quot;)
* The two species of tree cobras, Goldie&#x27;s tree cobra (&quot;Pseudohaje goldii&quot;) and the black tree cobra (&quot;Pseudohaje nigra&quot;)
* The two species of shield-nosed cobras, the Cape coral snake (&quot;Aspidelaps lubricus&quot;) and the shield-nosed cobra (&quot;Aspidelaps scutatus&quot;)
* The two species of black desert cobras or desert black snakes, &quot;Walterinnesia aegyptia&quot; and &quot;Walterinnesia morgani&quot;, neither of which rears upwards and produces a hood when threatened
* The eastern coral snake or American cobra (&quot;Micrurus fulvius&quot;), which also does not rear upwards and produce a hood when threatened

The false water cobra (&quot;Hydrodynastes gigas&quot;) is the only &quot;cobra&quot; species that is not a member of the Elapidae. It does not rear upwards, produces only a slight flattening of the neck when threatened, and is only mildly venomous.

<doc id="226930" wikidata="Q27107612" url="?curid=226930" title="Pancuronium bromide">
<text>Pancuronium (trademarked as Pavulon) is an aminosteroid muscle relaxant with various medical uses. It is used in euthanasia and is used in some states as the second of three drugs administered during lethal injections in the United States.

==Mechanism of action==
Pancuronium is a typical non-depolarizing curare-mimetic muscle relaxant. It competitively inhibits the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction by blocking the binding of acetylcholine. It has slight vagolytic activity, causing an increase in heart rate, but no ganglioplegic (i.e., blocking ganglions) activity. It is a very potent muscle relaxant drug, with an ED95 (i.e., the dose that causes 95% depression of muscle twitch response) of only 60 μg/kg body weight. Onset of action is relatively slow compared to other similar drugs, in part due to its low dose: an intubating dose takes 3–6 minutes for full effect. Clinical effects (muscle activity lower than 25% of physiological) last for about 100 minutes. The time needed for full (over 90% muscle activity) recovery after single administration is about 120–180 minutes in healthy adults. 

The effects of pancuronium can be at least partially reversed by anticholinesterasics, such as neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium.

==Development==
Workers at Organon were inspired by the structure of the aminosteroid alkaloid malouetine to develop a series of aminosteroid neuromuscular blockers based on an androstane nucleus, culminating in the development of pancuronium bromide.

Pancuronium is designed to mimic the action of two molecules of acetylcholine with the quaternary nitrogen atoms spaced rigidly apart by the steroid rings at a distance of ten atoms (interonium distance).
Decamethonium and suxamethonium also have this same interonium distance.

==Uses in medicine==
Pancuronium is used with general anesthesia in surgery for muscle relaxation and as an aid to intubation or ventilation. It does not have sedative or analgesic effects.

Side-effects include moderately raised heart rate and thereby arterial pressure and cardiac output, excessive salivation, apnea and respiratory depression, rashes, flushing, and sweating. The muscular relaxation can be dangerous in the seriously ill and it can accumulate leading to extended weakness. Pancuronium is not preferable in long-term use in ICU-ventilated patients.

In Belgium and the Netherlands, pancuronium is recommended in the protocol for euthanasia. After administering sodium thiopental to induce coma, pancuronium is delivered in order to stop breathing.

==Uses in execution and suicide==

===Procedure===
Pancuronium is also used as one component of a lethal injection in administration of the death penalty in some parts of the United States.

===Controversy===
Like all non-depolarising muscle relaxants, pancuronium has no effect on level of consciousness. Therefore, if the anaesthetic used is insufficient, the individual may be awake but unable to cry out or move due to the effect of the pancuronium. There have been several civil lawsuits alleging similar failures of adequate anaesthesia during general surgical procedures. These have been largely due to improper or insufficient dosages of anaesthetic in concert with normal dosages of muscle relaxants such as pancuronium.

In 2007, Michael Munro, a Scottish neonatologist at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, was cleared of malpractice by the General Medical Council Fitness to Practice panel after giving 23 times the standard dose of pancuronium to two dying neonates. Terminally ill, both dying babies were suffering from agonal gasping and violent body spasms, which was highly distressing for the parents to witness. Munro then administered pancuronium to the babies after advising the parents that this would ease their suffering and could also hasten death. It was on record that neither of the children&#x27;s parents were unhappy with Munro&#x27;s treatment.

Amnesty International has objected to its use in lethal injections on the grounds that it &quot;may mask the condemned prisoner&#x27;s suffering during the execution,&quot; thereby leading observers to conclude that lethal injection is painless, or less cruel than other forms of execution.

===Export limitations===
The United Kingdom bans the export of pancuronium bromide to the United States due to its use in lethal injections, but not to the Netherlands or Belgium.

==Uses in crime==
Pancuronium was used in Efren Saldivar&#x27;s killing spree. It was also used by the Skin Hunters to kill patients in the Polish city of Łódź. Pavulon was also used by Richard Angelo in 1987 to kill at least ten patients under his care at the Good Samaritan Hospital in New York.

<doc id="226932" wikidata="Q1377596" url="?curid=226932" title="Ion G. Duca">
<text>Ion Gheorghe Duca (; 20 December 1879 – 29 December 1933) was a Romanian liberal politician, diplomat, and lawyer who briefly served as Prime Minister from November to December 1933. A leading figure in the National Liberal Party, Duca held multiple ministerial roles, including Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior. As Prime Minister, he sought to modernize Romania and strengthen Western alliances but faced severe opposition from the Iron Guard, a revolutionary fascist movement. His crackdown on the group led to his assassination on 29 December 1933. Duca is remembered as an outspoken opponent of fascism, for his commitment to democracy and modernization and as a symbol of interwar Romania’s political turmoil.

== Early life ==
Ion Gheorghe Duca was born on 20 December 1879 in Bucharest, Romania, into a distinguished family known for its contributions to public service and engineering. His father, Gheorghe Duca, was a noted engineer and academic who played a key role in developing Romania’s railway system, offering Duca an early exposure to politics and public life. Duca pursued his higher education at the University of Paris, where he completed a doctorate in law, grounding him in the liberal ideals of European governance.

Upon returning to Romania, Duca joined the National Liberal Party, aligning with its agenda for modernisation, economic reform, and closer ties with Western Europe. With a sharp intellect and articulate style, he quickly gained recognition within the party and secured early political appointments, advocating for reforms in education and foreign policy. These formative experiences and his academic achievements paved the way for his influential career, establishing him as a leading voice in Romanian politics and diplomacy.

==Political career==

In November 1933, King Carol II appointed Duca as Prime Minister to prepare for the December elections. Duca aimed to curb the influence of the Iron Guard, also known as the Legion of the Archangel Michael, a fascist movement led by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. He moved swiftly to outlaw the Everything For the Country Party, the Iron Guard&#x27;s political arm, and initiated a crackdown on its activities. This period saw significant unrest, with police, acting on Duca&#x27;s orders, clashing with Iron Guard members, leading to the deaths of 18 members and the arrest of thousands. Many detainees were soon released, underscoring the government&#x27;s limited control over the volatile political climate.

Duca&#x27;s political career began when he entered Romania&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies in 1907 as a National Liberal Party. His cabinet tenure started in 1914, and by 1922 he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. Duca was a strong advocate for the Little Entente, a coalition formed by Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia to deter Hungarian irredentism particularly Hungary’s claims to Transylvania and the Banat, regions awarded to Romania after World War I—and to prevent any revival of the Habsburg monarchy in Central Europe. On July 7, 1923, he signed the Convention on the Defence Alliance between Romania and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with Yugoslav representative Bosko Čolak-Antić.

==Death==
On 29 December 1933, just 45 days into his term as Prime Minister, Duca was summoned to Peleș Castle, in Sinaia by King Carol II for consultations. Earlier that year, the king had appointed Duca, the new leader of the Liberal Party, to form a government. In an effort to curb the influence of the Iron Guard, Duca had dissolved the organization and held elections in December, where the Liberals won with a decisive 51% of the vote, partly due to peasant support shifting away from their traditional party. However, in retaliation, Iron Guard members ambushed Duca upon his return from the castle, fatally shooting him on the platform of the Sinaia train station. His assassination prompted the declaration of martial law across Romania.

Duca was assassinated by three Iron Guard members, that formed the Nicadori Iron Guard death squad, comprising Nicolae Constantinescu, Ion Caranica, and Doru Belimace. All three were arrested straight away and sentenced to hard labour for life. They were all killed, as were many other Iron Guard leaders, on 30 November 1938 while being transported to Jilava Prison.

==Legacy==
Duca left a significant legacy in Romanian history, not only for his contributions to politics but also through his detailed memoirs documenting his experiences as a cabinet minister during World War I. These writings provide valuable insights into Romanian political life and decision-making during a critical period. His son, George Duca, later edited both his own and his father&#x27;s memoirs while working at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University during the 1970s and 1980s, preserving Duca’s perspective for future generations.

In recognition of his influence, streets have been named in Duca’s honor in several Romanian cities, including Bucharest, Constanța, Craiova, Eforie, Mediaș, and Otopeni. Additionally, a gymnasium in Petroșani bears his name, commemorating his contributions to Romania’s political and cultural history.

<text>RTÉ2 (formerly branded as RTÉ 2 from 1978–88, Network 2 from 1988–97, N2 from 1997–2004 and RTÉ Two from 2004–14) is an Irish free-to-air television channel operated by public service broadcaster RTÉ. It was launched on 2 November 1978 as the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s second television channel, at which point the pre-existing channel was renamed RTÉ 1 (currently RTÉ One).
The channel airs content aimed at 16-45 year-olds.

==History==
In the 1970s, the Irish government considered three options for the introduction of a second television service: the re-transmission of BBC1 Northern Ireland; authorization of an independent commercial service; or charging RTÉ with the establishment of a second national channel. It was the last of these that was finally chosen.

After a period of test transmissions in the late summer and autumn the channel began scheduled broadcasting at 20:00 on 2 November 1978, opening with a broadcast of a gala ceremony from Cork Opera House. Owing to a technical error, audio from BBC2 was played during the countdown instead of the proper soundtrack. When the channel commenced programmes, there was no audio for the initial 15 seconds.

The opening night&#x27;s line up was as follows:

* 20:00 – RTÉ 2 presenters Bernadette Ní Ghallchóir, Roisin Harkin and Raymond Maxwell introduce viewers to Ireland&#x27;s second national television channel. The National Anthem followed.
* 20.05 – The President of Ireland, Patrick Hillery introduces the new service.
* 20.06 – &quot;First Night&quot;, a gala performance aired live from the Cork Opera House in Cork City, hosted by Mike Murphy. Guest stars included The Chieftains, Gemma Craven, Val Doonican, The George May Dancers, The Irish Ballet Company, The Montford Singers, John O&#x27;Connor, Maureen Potter, Colm C.T. Wilkinson and Lena Zavoroni. There were specially recorded inserts from British and American stars such as Bruce Forsyth, Ronnie Barker, Liberace, Sammy Davis Jr, Michael Parkinson, Andy Williams, Dana and Eamonn Andrews.
* 21.30 – The first movie to be shown on RTÉ 2, &quot;Bullitt&quot;, starring Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughan and Jacqueline Bisset.
* 23.30 – &quot;Newsnight&quot;, a late night summary of the national and international news headlines. 
* 23.35 – The channel closed down, ending the first night on air.

===RTÉ 2 (1978–1988)===
Up to 60% of the Republic of Ireland could receive UK channels via spillover or via cable. Cable in the republic was only permitted in areas of spillover up to the mid-1980s, to provide viewers with better reception of channels they could already receive over the air. Hence RTÉ 2 was aimed at those that did not have the UK channels. To this end one of their main remits was the re-broadcasting of UK programming to Irish audiences, that would not otherwise be seen on RTÉ 1.

The official opening on RTE 2 outlined the promised content of the new channel, with presenter Róisín Harkin stating: &quot;from ten to seven [i.e. 6:50 p.m.] each weekday, three o&#x27;clock on Saturdays and six o&#x27;clock on Sundays, RTÉ 2 will be bringing you the best of BBC, ITV and other first rate programming.&quot; In the first two years of the channel, it would normally open at 6pm and close down for the night at 11.30pm.

British soap drama &quot;Coronation Street&quot; aired on the channel simultaneously with ITV&#x27;s broadcasts of the programme (this continued until 1992 when it was put on RTÉ 1 due to the Olympic Games coverage). It broadcast much live programming from the BBC and ITV including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. However, the channel in its initial format was not considered a success. It was on air from 18:00 until 23:30 during the week, with an earlier start around 15:30 at weekends.

However, by 1987, RTÉ 2 rebranded as part of RTÉ&#x27;s 25th celebrations relaunched with a new corporate logo and TV idents, this would be the first time that the RTÉ corporate logo would be seen on RTÉ2. While the rebrand was a small success for the channel it was felt that RTÉ 2 and RTÉ 1 needed more specific audiences. RTÉ 2 at this stage was becoming more and more associated with youth orientated programming and sports programming (especially as UK and other international channels were becoming more and more available across the country). In 1988, the majority of sporting and children&#x27;s programming was moved to Network 2, the new name for RTÉ 2.

===Network 2 (1988–1997)===

In September 1988, RTÉ 2 was given a major revamp and became Network Two. In addition to the launch of a new vivid red, blue, and green logo, the channel now came on air at 14:30. &quot;The Den&quot; was moved to the channel, along with most youth and children&#x27;s programming. &quot;Jo Maxi&quot; was launched as the youth strand. &quot;Sports Stadium&quot; took up the entire Saturday afternoon schedule, and all sports programming was aired on the channel, along with Irish language programming. A late night news bulletin, &quot;Network News&quot;, was followed by the controversial but highly successful chat show / soap opera &quot;Nighthawks&quot; presented by Shay Healy, and produced by David Blake-Knox.

This relaunch was a big success, and Network Two remained stable until the mid-1990s. A new logo – referring to the channel as RTÉ Network 2 (though the &quot;RTÉ&quot; part was not referred to by announcers) – was launched with the new RTÉ logo in 1995. By this time, RTÉ Network 2 broadcast from mid-morning onwards, with educational programmes during the day. Also during this era, the channel experimented with late night broadcasts at weekends, under &quot;The End&quot; brand, anchored by Barry Murphy and Sean Moncrieff. Broadcast hours were extended to 03:00 every day with a new service called The Night Shift.

=== N2 (1997–2004) ===

There was another major revamp in November 1997, and the channel was visually rebranded as &quot;N2&quot;, though announcers continued to refer to &quot;Network 2&quot;. N2 brought about perhaps as big a change as the original relaunch, RTÉ branding was dropped from the station almost completely, with home produced programmes now being referred to as &quot;N2 Productions&quot; (foreign imports were &quot;N2 Presentations&quot;). A futuristic logo along with a series of unusual graphical idents were developed. In-vision announcing returned. More importantly, the channel&#x27;s line-up was completely refreshed. The late night schedule was completely revamped, with the launch of &quot;News 2&quot;—a tailored bulletin for young people—followed by a talk show, &quot;Later On 2&quot;. Monday nights became comedy nights, with the launch of home-produced comedy such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Feed The Gondolas&quot;. Elsewhere theme nights became a regular fixture, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. &quot;The Den&quot; was now broadcast all day until 18:00 and was renamed &quot;Den 2&quot;.

RTE 1 and N2 had separate Weather forecasts (November 1997- January 13, 2002). On Monday January 14, RTE 1 and N2 weather forecasts were remerged. 

Not all the changes were universally welcomed, with the &quot;N2&quot; era, RTÉ cancelled its long-running Saturday sports programme, &quot;Sports Stadium&quot; in 1997. 

Many of the innovations of the N2 era had faded out by 2003: Simpler creations replaced the idents and the in-vision continuity was scrapped again. &quot;Later On 2&quot; had more-or-less ended (one of the strands later continued as &quot;The View&quot; on RTÉ One). In September 2003, News 2 reverted to the regular RTÉ News format (as &quot;RTÉ News on Two&quot;).

From September 2003, continuity announcers and trailers began to refer to the channel by the fuller title of &quot;RTÉ Network Two&quot;, in line with a new RTÉ initiative to promote the corporate branding. The main channel idents never changed and said merely &quot;N2&quot; (although a newly introduced on-screen DOG said &quot;RTÉ N2&quot;.) and finally in 2004 Network 2 was relaunched as RTÉ Two, in line with its sister channel RTÉ One.

===RTÉ Two (2004–2014)===
RTÉ decided the channel needed another revamp to keep it fresh. The channel&#x27;s name reverted to RTÉ Two on the morning of 2 October 2004, with a themed evening of programmes called &quot;Farewell Network 2&quot; beginning at 20:00, featuring Podge and Rodge. The new logo is similar in style to the current RTÉ One logo. The new branding is designed to promote the Irishness of the station, green is the dominant colour. New strands were developed. In particular, the number of Irish made programmes has increased, though some of this is made up of a new strand of early evening repeats. The idents from this time were based on a Green Room theme.

The latest change has been a complete rebrand and relaunch of &quot;The Den&quot;, on Saturday 17 September 2005, with the &quot;id Two&quot; strand becoming &quot;TTV&quot; on the following Monday. In September 2009, &quot;TTV&quot; relaunched as &quot;Two Tube&quot;.

RTÉ Two got a new look on 17 September 2009. The new idents were created by RTÉ Graphic Design. Programme cutbacks saw the end of 24-hour broadcasting on the channel, with Euronews filling the down-time. Teleshopping was also introduced for the first time.

Continuing with the corporate branding of RTÉ radio and Television stations RTÉ Two&#x27;s iconic children&#x27;s brand &quot;The Den&quot; ended on 20 September 2010. &quot;The Den&quot; was replaced by TRTÉ, while &quot;Den Tots&quot; was replaced by RTÉjr; this was due mainly to the onset of digital TV on which RTÉjr is available as a separate channel. &quot;Two Tube&quot; remains as the teenage block of programming.

===RTÉ2 (2014–2017)===
From 22 September 2014 RTÉ Two became RTÉ2 and presented a new schedule of programming. The channel established itself as the &quot;voice for the under 35s&quot; where the new schedule continued with new seasons of &quot;New Girl&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;, &quot;Devious Maids&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; and the final season run of &quot;Mad Men&quot;. Brand new imported shows included &quot;Outlander&quot;, &quot;Gotham&quot;, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, &quot;iZombie&quot; and &quot;CSI Cyber&quot;. RTÉ2 confirmed it had secured broadcasting rights for two Danish drama series 1864 and &quot;The Saboteurs: The Heavy Water War&quot;, both broadcasting in 2015. In terms of home-produced Irish programming RTÉ2 confirmed the return of &quot;Other Voices&quot; (Season 13), Maia Dunphy&#x27;s &quot;What Women Want&quot; (Season 2), &quot;Second Captains Live&quot;, &quot;&#x27;The Savage Eye&quot; (final series), &quot;The Republic of Telly&quot;, &quot;Damo &amp; Ivor&quot;, &quot;The Fear&quot; and the newly created youth orientated news service &quot;News Feed&quot;. RTÉ2 also confirmed new Irish reality programmes including &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot;, &quot;Connected&quot;, &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, &quot;Bressie&#x27;s Teenage Kicks&quot;, and &quot;Drunk and #Trending&quot;.

RTÉ2 continued to focus on major sporting events and the channel will showcase Irish films in association with the Irish Film Board. TRTÉ will play a major role in the daytime schedule on the channel. Two Tube will continue to air from 17:30 until 19:00. It is proposed by RTÉ to launch RTÉ2+1 in efforts to raise much needed revenue.

By 2015, RTÉ2 began to focus on imported programming from Denmark, Iceland and Germany. The channel increased its output of Irish themed reality series.

=== RTÉ2 (since 2018) ===
On 3 November 2018, RTÉ2 celebrated its 40th anniversary and began to offer vintage clips of shows from RTÉ2 on the RTÉ archives website.

Much of the innovation and local programming on RTÉ2 has been cut by RTÉ. Outside of sports programming RTÉ2 programming includes the Irish version of &quot;First Dates&quot; and a DIY show called &quot;Home Rescue&quot;. Some innovations remain such as &quot;Other Voices&quot; and highlights from the RTÉ Choice Music Prize.

With children&#x27;s content now starting at 08:15 in the morning with RTÉjr, following a simulcast of Euronews, and finishing at 4:30.

===RTÉ2 HD===
The HD channel launched on Saorview on 27 May 2011. The service broadcasts sports, documentaries, movies and American, Canadian, and Australian programming in a high-definition 1080i format.

On 15 March 2012, RTÉ2 HD was added to UPC Ireland.

RTÉ2 HD was added to Sky on 16 May 2012. RTÉ2 HD was due to launch on Sky on 14 May 2012, but was delayed by two days due to technical problems. On 22 April 2024, RTÉ2 SD was shut down on Sky, marking the end of the standard-definition feed.

====Format====
* The channel simulcasts content from RTÉ2 SD and upscales SD content into HD. All other content on the channel is made available entirely in HD, this includes Gaelic Athletic Association, Champions League, World Cup, Olympic Games, Pro14 sporting content, USA television series and movies.

===RTÉ2 +1===

RTÉ2 +1 launched on 19 February 2019, and it broadcasts daily from 19:00 until 02:00 Monday to Friday and 12:00 until 02:00 Saturday and Sunday. The channel launched only on Saorview and it will eventually roll out onto other platforms such as Sky Ireland and Virgin Media Ireland.

==Programming==
RTÉ2 provides a broad range of programming which is mainly targeted towards young people up to 45-year-olds. Between 08:00 to 16:30 kids and teens programming is served by RTÉjr (separate to the channel) and the teenage strands TRTÉ and Two Tube. From 19:00 onwards, RTÉ2 provides a wide range of programming from Irish produced content, sports, comedy, dramas, films and acquisitions from North America, Australia, the UK and Central Europe. RTÉ2 has a strong tradition of broadcasting many US TV shows prior to other European broadcasters, though this has slightly changed in recent years.

Films are also regularly aired on the channel especially Irish-European cinema and International cinema. Until September 2014, RTÉ2 had stands such as &quot;Two Wild&quot; (nature documentaries), &quot;Two Extreme&quot; (extreme sports/adventure documentaries), and &quot;RTÉ Sport on Two&quot;, these strands were axed in 2014 but the strands contents play an important role in the current schedule.

===RTÉ 2 Controller===
Dick Hill was RTÉ 2&#x27;s first controller until 1994.

During the time of the 1997 rebrand of the channel as N2 they had placed the Head of Schedule as &quot;controller&quot; of the channel. Up until then, the channel was run side by side RTÉ One under RTÉ Television. In October 1988 RTÉ 2 was repositioned as Network 2, with a full relaunch of the channel as &#x27;N2&#x27; in November 1997.

Andrew Fitzpatrick was poached to take control of RTÉ scheduling from TV3; however, N2 basically reverted to being part of the overall RTÉ Television structure.

With no dedicated channel controller until then, in May 2011 it was announced by RTÉ that Eddie Doyle had been given the position of commissioning editor at RTÉ Two. Eddie Doyle was RTÉ Commission Editor of Entertainment.

In May 2013 RTÉ announced Bill Malone as RTÉ Two&#x27;s controller. Eddie Doyle became Head of Comedy, Talent Development and Music at RTÉ.

In July 2016 Bill Malone moved to rival channel TV3 (now Virgin Media Television) as Head of Programming. Channel Control at RTÉ One, Adrian Lynch, took over the role at RTÉ2 and eventual became Director of Channels and Marketing at the broadcaster in 2018.

====1988–1993====
As Network 2 the service still focused strongly on imported programming, RTÉ would now look to have first runs of US programming before other European networks.

All of the daytime repeat programmes were replaced by Children&#x27;s television while Late Night TV was extended until 2 am each morning with shows like, &quot;Profiler&quot;, &quot;Millennium&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (only airing the first season), &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and some Australian serials including &quot;Water Rats&quot; and &quot;Murder Call&quot;.

==Irish-produced programming==

===Reality TV===
The 2000s like many other broadcasters RTÉ2 have had several reality based TV shows.

In 2003, Network 2 set out to find their news TV presenter in a reality show called &quot;The Selection Box&quot;; the eventual winner was Caroline Morahan.

RTÉ2 also produced two series of the employment reality show &quot;No Experience Required&quot;, three prospective candidates are evaluated over the course of a week for a vacant position in a top company, the show follows them through interview stages and tasks set out by their prospective employees.

In 2008, RTÉ Two broadcast &quot;Hollywood Trials&quot;. It follow a group of young actors travelling to make it big in LA. The actors where selected by Hollywood acting guru Margie Haber. Those selected to travel with Margie to LA included Chris Newman from the RTÉ Two drama &quot;Love is the Drug&quot;, George McMahon from RTÉ One soap opera &quot;Fair City&quot; and Michael Graham of Boyzone fame.

&quot;Hollywood Trials&quot; was then followed by &quot;The Model Agent&quot;. The model agent in question was Fiona Ellis and with help of Erin O&#x27;Connor as the girls mentor she picked Carrie-Anne Burton for a contract with Independent Models, one of the world&#x27;s leading modelling agencies and a cover for Image magazine, one of the Ireland&#x27;s most high profile and respected fashion titles.

&quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, another reality series, began in September 2010 and was presented by Lucy Kennedy and Baz Ashmawy, in search of Ireland&#x27;s ultimate volunteer and to win a year-long volunteering trip abroad.

In 2011 &quot;Masterchef Ireland&quot; began airing on the channel.

RTÉ2 also ran spin-off serials to RTÉ One&#x27;s reality shows, such as &quot;You&#x27;re a Star Uncut&quot;, &quot;Cabin Fever&quot;, and &quot;Treasure Island Uncovered&quot;.

First Dates Ireland began broadcasting in 2016.

===Drama===
In the first two decades of RTÉ2, little original drama was produced for the channel; often RTÉ would just repeat their dramas on the channel such as &quot;Fair City&quot; and &quot;Glenroe&quot;. RTÉ did place some emphasis on short film in the RTÉ series &quot;Short Cuts&quot;. Short films remain on RTÉ2 most Monday nights at 11:30; these shorts are not just taken from RTÉ co-financed productions but also from independent producers around the world.

RTÉ2&#x27;s most successful drama was a drama/comedy/chat show entitled &quot;Nighthawks&quot; presented by Shay Healy. This was produced as a pseudo-documentary about the behind the scenes of the television production, it featured many well known Irish comedians, however unlike the mockumentary &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Nighthawks&quot; featured real interviews and was created by David Blake Knox, who went on to be controller of Network 2 until 1998. Gerry Ryan had a similar format show called &quot;Gerry Ryan Tonight&quot; during the 1990s.

====2000–2008====

From 2000 to 2008, RTÉ were committed to providing new and original drama on RTÉ2 each Monday night each autumn. The dramas had mixed reviews but they included &quot;Paths to Freedom&quot; (2000), &quot;Bachelors Walk&quot; (2001–2003), &quot;The Big Bow Wow&quot; (2003), &quot;Pure Mule&quot; (2004), &quot;Love is the Drug&quot; (2004) and &quot;Prosperity&quot; (2007). &quot;Raw&quot; was RTÉ2&#x27;s last Monday night drama; it received mixed reviews but it reached on average 250,000 viewers each week against RTÉ One&#x27;s &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; and TV3&#x27;s &quot;The Apprentice&quot;; Raw&#x27;s second series ran on RTÉ One. Most of RTÉ2&#x27;s drama output was aimed at a younger audience than that of RTÉ One&#x27;s and it often contained bad language and sex scenes.

RTÉ ended their RTÉ2 drama&#x27;s in 2008 with the first series of &quot;Raw&quot;, choosing to air its second series on RTÉ One. RTÉ are not currently looking for drama specifically for RTÉ2 which brings to an end a significant amount of work brought to the channel from RTÉ&#x27;s drama department and independent producers. Many of the dramas of this era on RTÉ were seen as experimental but also highly modern and innovative.

===Comedy===
Monday night was comedy night on RTÉ2 from 1997 to 2006. Many US sitcoms were intermixed with live Irish comedy such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Feed The Gondolas (DFTG)&quot;, &quot;The Panel&quot;, &quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot;, &quot;A Scare at Bedtime with Podge and Rodge&quot;, &quot;@LastTV&quot;, &quot;The Liffey Laughs&quot;, &quot;The Blizzard of Odd&quot;, &quot;The Byrne Ultimatum&quot; and &quot;Night Live&quot;.

===RTÉ Young Peoples===
RTÉ Young People&#x27;s department oversees programming for under-5s, 5- to 12-year-olds and teenage audiences. As part of RTÉ2&#x27;s redevelopment in 1988 as Network 2, most of RTÉ&#x27;s young people&#x27;s programming moved from RTÉ One to Network 2.

====Children&#x27;s television====
&quot;Dempsey&#x27;s Den&quot; was hosted by Ian, Zig and Zag and Zuppy. It moved to Network 2 from RTÉ One, and broadcasting for an extra hour from 15:00 to 18:00. Network 2 would start the day 14:30 with &quot;Bosco&quot; a pre-school television show. All children&#x27;s television moved to Network 2 when it rebranded in 1988. When Ian Dempsey left Dempsey&#x27;s Den the show was renamed &quot;The Den&quot;, with a new presenter, Ray D&#x27;Arcy. D&#x27;Arcy presented the show from 1990 to 1997 when the strand began to expand it schedule into the early hours of the morning. From 1997 to 2010 &quot;The Den&quot; ran for 10 hours a day starting at 07:00 to 17:00 followed by a strand which was given various titles and targeted at a teenage audience. When RTÉ rebranded their children&#x27;s strands in 2010, this effectively axed the country&#x27;s longest-running children&#x27;s TV show.

Saturday programming came from RTÉ Cork from the mid-1990s to the late-2000s, starting with &quot;The Swamp&quot; which took the place of classic Irish children&#x27;s TV such as &quot;Pajo&#x27;s Junkbox&quot;, &quot;Scratch Saturday&quot; and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (which broadcast on RTÉ One). &quot;Satitude&quot; was RTÉ Cork&#x27;s main TV show for children and was broadcast on The Den on RTÉ2 on Saturday mornings. &quot;Satitude&quot; was cancelled in 2009.

Den Tots was The Den&#x27;s pre-school strand. It has been replaced by RTÉjr; RTÉ do not advertise during these selected hours.

====Teenage television====

Shows for young people in the 1970s and 1980s included:

* &quot;MT USA&quot;, a pop video music programming presented from New York by pioneering Irish radio DJ and television presenter Vincent Hanley
* &quot;Youthline&quot;, a series which looked at new and upcoming artists such as U2

In the late 1980s, RTÉ began simulcasting &quot;The Beatbox&quot; with 2FM as a replacement for &quot;MT USA&quot;. Presenters included Barry Lang, Electric Eddie (Doug Murray), Simon Young, Peter Collins, Ian Dempsey. It was replaced in 1995 with Dave Fanning&#x27;s &quot;2TV&quot;. &quot;2TV&quot; spawned several spin offs: late night videos hosted by Jon Slattery, and RTÉ&#x27;s only attempt at a morning show in 1999 with Bianka Luykx.

In 1988, &quot;Jo Maxi&quot; appeared for the first time until 1993, a daily teen show airing at 18:00, which was later replaced by Echo Island and in the early 2000s by &quot;ID&quot;, followed by &quot;ID2&quot;, &quot;TTV&quot; and &quot;Two Tube&quot;. Within the programming block, contained such shows as &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot; (repeated from RTÉ One), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot;.

===News and current affairs===
Since January 2017 RTÉ2 provides no regular prime time news or current affairs programme. Children&#x27;s news programme News2day remains part of their line up, however this programme only airs until the end of May, with it finishing up in Mid-March in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

From 1978 to 2014, RTÉ2 provided late night news. The first such news programme was called &quot;NewsNight&quot;. The programme was a wide international news service which provided news stories from US and UK broadcasters the show also included a national news bulletin, the final late night news on the channel was called &quot;RTÉ News on Two&quot;.

As part of the relaunch of RTÉ Two as Network 2 in 1988 the news was renamed &quot;Network News&quot;. The news was now similar in style to the newly launched &quot;Six One&quot; news and &quot;Nine News&quot; on RTÉ One.

In 1997, with the possibility of competition from a new local broadcaster Network 2 relaunch again known on screen as N2. Late night news was renamed &quot;News2&quot; and was hosted by Sharon Ní Bheoláin and Anthony Murnane and aimed at a much younger audience. Its content was customised for a younger audience, and presenters and journalists tend to use more informal language on the programme.

In 2004 following another relaunch back to the name of back to RTÉ TWO, the programme was renamed &quot;RTÉ News on Two.&quot; It was the final RTÉ late evening news programme to air on the channel. The program was broadcast Monday-Thursday. It did not have a regular time slot, but was usually broadcast at some point between 22:45 and 23:30. In October 2006 Eileen Whelan became the main presenter for the programme, following the departure of Anthony Murnane who was with the programme since 1997. John O&#x27;Driscoll was the programme Editor. When RTÉ launched their mid-breakfast programme, &quot;Morning Edition,&quot; on RTÉ One &quot;RTÉ News on Two was&quot; reduced to a 10-minute bulletin, until its demise in 2014.

In March 2007 until September 2014 it was available as streamed live on the RTÉ website. On Fridays an extended late summary on RTÉ One was broadcast instead of RTÉ News on Two.

On 22 September 2014 it was dropped in favour of two bulletins at 18:55 and 19:55 called &quot;News Feed,&quot; it was cancelled in January 2017.

Current affairs programming on the channel included &quot;Market Place&quot; a business news show and &quot;Later on 2.&quot; On Budget Day, RTÉ broadcast Opposition speeches on RTÉ2, while both RTÉ One and RTÉ News Now covered analysis of the budget. In 2018 due to an Irish Soccer match on the same night the Budget speeches moved to the RTÉ News channel, where they have since remained.

===Sport===
In 2019 it was announced that RTÉ planned to move all major sporting events to RTÉ One.

RTÉ2 broadcasts the majority of RTÉ&#x27;s sports content. Since RTÉ own rights to several competitions any fixtures clashing with RTÉ2&#x27;s schedule will often be provided on RTÉ One, however RTÉ One rarely provides sporting events on weekdays hence most soccer matches are shown on RTÉ2.

RTÉ2 also covers some smaller sports such as athletics, cycling, extreme sports, golf, field hockey, racquet sports, scuba diving, target shooting, triathlon, and water sports.

RTÉ have had exclusive rights to the World Cup tournament; coverage is on RTÉ2 while rte.ie provides coverage of clashing games. Having been the only national service until the arrival of TG4 and TV3 in the mid-1990s. In 1990 RTÉ made a major investment into the coverage of the tournament which coincided with Ireland&#x27;s successful campaign under the management of Jack Charlton. The main panel of pundits appeared for the first time consisting of presenter Bill O&#x27;Herlihy and pundits John Giles and Eamon Dunphy. For their coverage of 1998 World Cup, RTÉ introduced the comedy &quot;Apres Match&quot;, a mock of the panel of pundits.

===Entertainment===

RTÉ2&#x27;s entertainment content is generally aimed at a young audience to that of its sister channel RTÉ One. Since 1988 RTÉ2 has been successful with a number of entertainment shows aimed at the 15- to 35-year-old age group.

In the early years of RTÉ2 music shows on the channel consisted of &quot;Music TV USA&quot; every Friday night, which was then repeated on Sunday afternoons at 3 pm. In the mid-1980s this was replaced by &quot;The Beatbox&quot; presented by Ian Dempsey. From 1995, Dave Fanning presented a near identical programme under the new name of &quot;2TV&quot;. &quot;The Beatbox&quot; and &quot;2TV&quot; were both broadcast on 2FM RTÉ&#x27;s popular music radio station.

&quot;No Disco&quot; was an alternative music show for late night TV from 1993 to 2003, it was hosted by initially by Donal Dineen who left to present radio on Radio Ireland in 1997. Uaneen Fitzsimons took his place on the show, seen as a major upcoming television talent. Fitzsimons died in a road accident in 2000. She had made a significant name for herself on the show, and her knowledge of the music industry, her love of the music and her respect for her guests was apparent throughout the show.

&quot;When Under Ether&quot; is a music magazine show launched in 2009 and focuses on alternative, indie and electronica music.

In 1997, &quot;Later On 2&quot;, aired on Tuesday nights, was the arts review show presented by John Kelly who later presented a similar show on RTÉ One called &quot;The View&quot;. Also in 1997, RTÉ introduced a set of comedy television shows on the newly re-launched N2 service. &quot;Don&#x27;t Feed the Gondolas&quot; or &quot;DFTG&quot; was presented by Seán Moncreiff and later by Brendan O&#x27;Connor. In the initial years Brendan O&#x27;Connor was one of the main team captains, during the final season Brendan O&#x27;Connor became the main host with only three guests. Other shows to begin that year included &quot;Podge and Rodge: A Scare at Bedtime&quot; and &quot;@LastTV&quot;, a fast-paced review show with interviews, comedy sketches and music.

In 2009, RTÉ2 revamped its entertainment season with critics and fans still undecided about new titles which included &quot;The Byrne Ultimatum&quot;, &quot;Maeve Higgins&#x27; Fancy Vittles&quot;, &quot;Republic of Telly&quot; and &quot;Podge &amp; Rodge&#x27;s Stickit Inn&quot;.

===Cláracha Gaeilge===

As part of RTÉ Two&#x27;s re-brand to Network 2 some emphasizes was put on Irish language programming including a daily current affairs show called &quot;Cursaí&quot;. The series ran from 1988 to 1996 at 19:00 Monday to Friday. The series was later moved around both RTÉ channels. RTÉ retained the arts spin-off programme, &quot;Cursaí Ealaíona&quot;, into the late 1990s on RTÉ One. RTÉ also broadcast a daily news service in Irish at 20:00 each night, this later moved to RTÉ One.

RTÉ provides Irish language children&#x27;s programming on both RTÉjr and TRTÉ, much of its Irish language programming has moved to either RTÉ One or TG4. In the early 1990s RTÉ suggested using RTÉ Two&#x27;s evening schedule for Irish Language programming, rather than starting a new service.

Other Irish language programming on RTÉ Two included school&#x27;s quiz &quot;Eureka&quot; and light entertainment show &quot;Seán Bán in a Shuí&quot;.

<doc id="226935" wikidata="Q2393499" url="?curid=226935" title="Yates's correction for continuity">
<text>In statistics, Yates&#x27;s correction for continuity (or Yates&#x27;s chi-squared test) is used in certain situations when testing for independence in a contingency table. It aims
at correcting the error introduced by assuming that the discrete probabilities of frequencies in the table can be approximated by a continuous distribution (chi-squared). Unlike the standard Pearson chi-squared statistic, it is approximately unbiased.

==Correction for approximation error==
Using the chi-squared distribution to interpret Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared statistic requires one to assume that the discrete probability of observed binomial frequencies in the table can be approximated by the continuous chi-squared distribution. This assumption is not quite correct, and introduces some error.

To reduce the error in approximation, Frank Yates, an English statistician, suggested a correction for continuity that adjusts the formula for Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test by subtracting 0.5 from the difference between each observed value and its expected value in a 2 × 2 contingency table. This reduces the chi-squared value obtained and thus increases its p-value.

The effect of Yates&#x27;s correction is to prevent overestimation of statistical significance for small data. This formula is chiefly used when at least one cell of the table has an expected count smaller than 5.

:formula_1

The following is Yates&#x27;s corrected version of Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared statistics:

:formula_2

where:

:&quot;Oi&quot; = an observed frequency
:&quot;Ei&quot; = an expected (theoretical) frequency, asserted by the null hypothesis
:&quot;N&quot; = number of distinct events

== 2 × 2 table ==
As a short-cut, for a 2 × 2 table with the following entries:

: formula_3

In some cases, this is better.

: formula_4

Yates&#x27;s correction should always be applied, as it will tend to improve the accuracy of the p-value obtained. However, in situations with large sample sizes, using the correction will have little effect on the value of the test statistic, and hence the p-value.

<text>London Weekend Television (LWT; now part of the non-franchised ITV London region) was the ITV network franchise holder for Greater London and the Home Counties at weekends, broadcasting from Fridays at 5.15 pm (7:00 pm from 1968 until 1982) to Monday mornings at 6:00. From 1968 until 1992, when LWT&#x27;s weekday counterpart was Thames Television, there was an on-screen handover to LWT on Friday nights (there was no handover back to Thames on Mondays, as from 1968 to 1982 there was no programming in the very early morning, and from 1983, when a national breakfast franchise was created, LWT would hand over to TV-am at 6:00am, which would then hand over to Thames at 9:25am). From 1993 to 2002, when LWT&#x27;s weekday counterpart was Carlton Television, the transfer usually occurred invisibly during a commercial break, for Carlton and LWT shared studio and transmission facilities (although occasionally a Thames-to-LWT-style handover would appear).

Like most ITV regional franchises, including Carlton&#x27;s, the London weekend franchise is now operated by ITV plc. The &quot;London Weekend&quot; franchise was renewed by Ofcom in 2015 for ten years and is still separately licensed, but is no longer distinguished on air. LWT is now managed with Carlton Television as a single entity (ITV London), although the name for the London Weekend licence on the Ofcom site is still &quot;LWT&quot;. London Weekend Television Ltd is now (along with most other former regional companies owned by ITV plc) listed at Companies House as a &quot;dormant company&quot;.

==History==
===Early years===
====Creation====
The London Television Consortium (LTC) was created and led by television presenter David Frost, who, at the time, was working for the London weekday ITV station Rediffusion. The consortium also included three ex-BBC members of staff: Michael Peacock (controller of BBC1), Frank Muir (assistant head of BBC comedy) and Doreen Stephens (head of children&#x27;s output). Rediffusion&#x27;s Controller of Programmes, Cyril Bennett, also joined the consortium, along with Clive Irving, theatre director Peter Hall and, for financial backing, Arnold Weinstock, managing director of GEC.

Frost had originally considered applying for the new Yorkshire region franchise, but the expected high number of applicants led to a change of plans. The second choice was to take on Rediffusion for their contract but, although it held the largest and most profitable licence, it was felt that the company was too powerful to challenge; equally, as an employee of the station, he felt it would be seen as an act of betrayal. Changes elsewhere in the system (notably the decision to make the Midlands licence a seven-day operation) led Frost to believe that the existing Midlands weekday broadcaster ATV had a significant risk of losing its London weekend contract.

The consortium&#x27;s application promised a variety of highbrow arts and drama productions. It accordingly caught the attention of the regulator, the Independent Television Authority (ITA), and it seemed to address concerns and criticisms raised in the Pilkington Report. The authority had been worried by criticism of the network&#x27;s output, which was seen as downmarket and the LTC plans were viewed by the ITA as being serious contenders to the quality educational programming of the BBC. So keen was the ITA that it was quoted at the time as saying the LTC had to have its chance, whatever the repercussions.

The new company, renamed London Weekend Television, benefited from a slight extension in broadcasting hours, as they were allocated Fridays from 7 p.m., as well as Saturday and Sunday. The LTC had planned on buying the superior Teddington Studios of former contractor ABC Weekend TV, but following ABC&#x27;s merger with Rediffusion to form Thames Television, the LTC were forced by the ITA to purchase Rediffusion&#x27;s Wembley Studios and legally obliged to employ all members of staff, although the workforce was slightly larger than LWT had wanted. Having previously worked weekdays for Rediffusion, transmission staff now had to work at weekends, and, as a result, wanted extra pay for the unsocial hours. This led to threats of industrial action, and, with the dispute still unresolved, fifteen seconds into their opening night of 2 August 1968, technicians went on strike and the screens went blank. An emergency service was provided by management from the transmission centre of ATV at Foley Street, London.

====Near collapse====
Upon resolving the dispute, LWT suffered poor rating figures, as the station&#x27;s evening viewing schedule included a Stravinsky musical drama, an avant-garde drama from French film director Jean-Luc Godard, a tribute to Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel, and &quot;Georgia Brown Sings Kurt Weill&quot;. As a consequence, viewers deserted its primetime offerings in favour of the more mainstream Saturday night viewing on BBC1. Other ITV stations refused to show LWT productions because of the poor ratings. ATV, now the seven-day Midlands franchise holder after losing their London contract to LWT, refused to transmit any of their programmes in peak time; elsewhere, the powerful sales department at Thames Television, who provided London with a Monday to Friday service, took advantage of LWT&#x27;s ratings crisis by adopting a &quot;beggar thy neighbour&quot; strategy, encouraging advertisers to use Thames during the week by heavily discounting their airtime.

The situation came to a head during a meeting of the Network Programme Committee on 9 September 1968. The NPC was being chaired by Lew Grade, ATV&#x27;s managing director, and he is quoted as saying on this occasion: &quot;I&#x27;ve succeeded in business by knowing exactly what I hate&quot;, he told them. &quot;And I know I hate David Frost.&quot; Frost was present, but no one else spoke out against LWT&#x27;s programming policy. Meanwhile, the £6.5 million it had initially put up for the franchise began to drain away more quickly than its audience figures. Michael Peacock, the architect in David Frost&#x27;s vision for the future of television, wanted to stick to the principles of their contract with the ITA. ATV dropped Frost&#x27;s major Saturday night slot altogether and replaced him with comedian Dave Allen, while Yorkshire and Granada relegated the show to the late evening.

In September 1969, Michael Peacock was sacked by the board while six executives resigned from LWT in support. The ITA made it clear that LWT&#x27;s franchise proposals must be retained. As the crisis at LWT deepened, staff members held a protest outside the offices of the ITA, complaining about the changes happening at the station. An 800-strong petition was handed in to the ITA, to ask for an inquiry about the crisis at LWT. The ITA started to make emergency plans in the event of the company collapsing, and MPs asked questions in Parliament. At the same time, Thames started making enquiries about a seven-day contract in such an event – an offer quickly rebuffed by the ITA. In the general panic that followed, the General Electric Company withdrew financial backing and sold its 7.5% share to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International in November 1970. By December 1970, Murdoch become a part-time executive and injected £500,000 of new capital, increasing his share to 30% as part of the deal, also insisting on terminating Frost and his Paradine Productions, an action that was carried out at once. He continued to increase his stake further and, by the end of 1971, he possessed 39.7%.

Rupert Murdoch became managing director in February 1971. When Dr Tom Margerison left the company, he stated &quot;there is no question of personal animosity between Rupert and myself. It&#x27;s just one of those things: you cannot have two people running a ship.&quot; He had believed Murdoch was to become a non-executive director, but it was clear that he was going further than this.

Murdoch started restructuring LWT, but within weeks five other board members left. The ITA was unhappy at how Murdoch was able to buy his way into the company, because foreign nationals were legally blocked from owning the ITV contractors. It also demanded assurances that LWT&#x27;s original programme policies and operations were sound. As a result, the ITA, concerned about Murdoch owning both a television station and significant newspaper interests, forced Murdoch from the chairmanship of LWT, and, on 9 March 1971, John Freeman, best known for presenting &quot;Face to Face&quot; for the BBC, became chairman and chief executive of LWT. He said &quot;I expect many people are thinking I need my head examining, but I decided to take it up all the same. The public should have the kinds of programmes it wants, which means you must take into account minority interests as well as majority ones&quot;. Freeman made it quite clear that he expected to have full control within the company without any interference from Murdoch.

By early May, Freeman reappointed Cyril Bennett as Controller of Programmes, along with many of the original personnel who helped start up the company in 1967.

With these changes, LWT became influenced by the same character Murdoch&#x27;s newspapers had. In time the station became regarded as a populist, conservative counterpart to the more highbrow and liberal Thames; hardly the BBC2-like ideal that Frost and Peacock had envisioned.

Audience share grew, and, in 1975, the company won seven BAFTA awards – more than the rest of ITV put together. Although the programming had changed from their original remit, LWT still produced shows which were considered more upmarket, in particular &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. Unlike earlier offerings these attracted high audiences. LWT continued to show arts programming, mainly &quot;Aquarius&quot; and its successor &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.

===Improving fortunes===

====1970s====
LWT&#x27;s fortunes improved, which helped increase profits, and more money was made available for new programming. In 1972, &quot;Weekend World&quot; was launched; a weekly current affairs programme broadcast on Sundays at noon, presented by journalist Peter Jay. In 1974, the Director of Programmes at Thames, Brian Tesler, left to become Deputy Chief Executive to John Freeman. In the autumn of 1974, LWT challenged the BBC by spending £3.75 million on what it believed represented the biggest range of talent and varied scheduling for viewers, including Stanley Baxter, Danny La Rue, a number of new dramas and another current affairs show, which helped push up profits to nearly £4 million.

In May 1976, LWT was reorganised to form a new company, LWT (Holdings) Limited which allowed the company to expand into a number of new ventures, including Hutchinson Publishing. The LWT Chairman &amp; Chief Executive John Freeman said &quot;an important factor was the deal would provide revenue from a wholly different source thus in part insulating LWT from the effects of any future adverse fluctuations in advertising revenue&quot;. In the same month he stood down as Chief Executive, and the Board appointed Brian Tesler as the company&#x27;s managing director. Cyril Bennett died later that year, and Tesler doubled as the company&#x27;s Director of Programmes until he appointed Michael Grade to that role in February 1977. Three decades later the official history of ITV, &quot;Independent Television in Britain&quot;, observed &quot;Under Brian Tesler&#x27;s Managing Directorship LWT was to become the success for which its founders (almost all of whom had by that time left the company) had so earnestly striven.&quot;

In November 1978, News International sold off 16% of its LWT holding, reducing its shares from 39.7% to 25%, as it believed this was going to be one of the outcomes from the &quot;Annan Report on Broadcasting&quot;. LWT also warned shareholders that heavy spending on programmes would continue to reduce chances of increased profits. News International sold its remaining 25% stake on 13 March 1980, bringing an end to LWT&#x27;s connection with the Australian tycoon.

After the 1979 ITV strike, LWT was hit hard. During November 1979 LWT believed it had managed to only lose around £200,000 over the course of the dispute. Its acquisition of specialist travel and tour operator Page &amp; Moy and its Hutchinson publishing operations helped offset the losses made during the strike. Interim reports in April 1980 highlight LWT profits reducing by £2 million. By November it became clear that LWT profits had remained roughly the same as in the previous year, even with turnover increasing from £70.5 million to £80.5 million.

====1980s====
The 1982 franchise round was the first time LWT had to re-apply for its licence. The original 1968 contract was supposed to have ended in 1974. Instead, the new Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) had elected to extend all franchise contracts to 1981, owing to the enormous costs of introducing colour television. While it is debatable whether the licence would have been renewed if LWT had had to re-apply in 1973, by 1982, the company was in good health, and it easily beat off weak competition to secure a second contract – although it lost the Bluebell Hill transmitter near Maidstone to the new Television South, known as TVS, as part of a reorganisation prompted by the creation of the South and South East dual region. However, due to the recession, the company still had to tighten its belt. LWT had developed a reputation in many fields, including co-ordination of the ITV network&#x27;s sport productions and presentation.

In January 1982, John Birt became LWT&#x27;s new Director of Programmes when Michael Grade left to accept the post of Company President at Tandem Productions in the US, while Barry Cox became Head of Current Affairs. Birt&#x27;s time as Programme Director resulted in a change of direction. He started overhauling the schedules, to maximise audience numbers: his measures to achieve this included moving some niche shows back out of peak time, and putting Cilla Black under contract. He criticised how ITV companies were spending huge amounts of money on local programmes and post-watershed dramas, which left a funding gap for shows broadcast between the two periods, which did not help LWT as it only had a two-and-a-half-day franchise period.

John Birt also started reviewing spending budgets for all departments to provide the best returns which resulted in &quot;The Stanley Baxter Show&quot; being cancelled. LWT also postponed and shelved a number of other productions during the early 1980s, due to cost and frustration with other ITV companies&#x27; ideas for the weekend schedules.

In 1983, Birt published a document with proposals for an additional £50 million to be spent every year on peak time programmes: shows concerning religion, the arts and current affairs would be pruned to free up cash. His argument for doing this was that ITV made 75% of its money in peak time, but the peak time was riddled with a number of weak slots which reduced the maximum amount of revenue; again, LWT was at a disadvantage compared with the other ITV franchise holders. Birt believed that LWT and others should transfer more of its public service broadcasting commitments to the new Channel 4.

LWT finally found a solution in 1985, when an agreement was reached with TVS, which wished to expand its own output for the ITV network. However, as TVS was not one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; ITV companies, it had no real influence on the Network Programming Committee. Under the control of Greg Dyke as Director of Programmes, TVS started to move away from its original philosophy of niche arts and science programming, and began producing more entertainment programmes. The deal helped LWT to fill its schedules with appropriate, domestically-produced programming while not having to increase its budget, while TVS was able to get more of its programmes onto the ITV network slots. TVS retained its original philosophy for its regional and children&#x27;s programmes.

On 29 October 1986, London Weekend Television had acquired a majority stake in the new company, The Silverbach-Lazarus Group, which is a Los Angeles-based home video and television company, which fueled the expansion of SLG&#x27;s syndication activities and the Regency Home Video branch of the Silverbach-Lazarus Group, distributing product including Entertainment Partners, Gaylord Production Company, Glen-Warren Productions, Newmark Productions, Phoenix Entertainment Group, Schaefer/Karpf Productions and Visual Productions, and decided to add offices for the Chicago branch.

In April 1987, Greg Dyke moved from TVS to LWT again to be Director of Programmes (replacing John Birt) – having originally worked at LWT in 1978, before moving to TV-am in 1983 and TVS in 1985. At the same time, LWT started re-sectioning the company in a bid to cut costs and overhaul the working practices within the company ahead of a new franchise period.

As part of the cost-cutting review, the idea was floated that LWT could become a &quot;commissioning&quot; organisation – similar to Channel 4 – with its programme production operations being sold off to a new company, in a bid to &quot;sharpen up its competitiveness&quot;. Consultancy company NERA was brought in to investigate the matter. The plan was halted in early 1988, as LWT chairman Christopher Bland, along with Greg Dyke, started to streamline operations; over four years, more than 690 people were made redundant, whole layers of management were scrapped and working practices were overhauled. But with the plan still a possibility, Dyke was able to offer lavish redundancy payments, ultimately getting the changes through.

Greg Dyke explained: &quot;To completely restructure your business for less than a year&#x27;s profits is a good deal. I have no problem with that.&quot; Another change was to make production operations a profit centre, with studios to rent – and with various uses from Jonathan Ross shows to sales conferences. These operations continue to earn millions a year for ITV.

In the late 1980s, LWT moved into backing films including &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Tall Guy&quot; (1989).

====1990s and takeover====

In 1990 LWT created the second ITV Sales company Laser Sales, to deal with its own and TVS&#x27;s advertising operations. The Broadcasting Act 1990 brought changes to the way ITV contracts were awarded. No longer a &#x27;beauty-contest&#x27;, but rather a blind auction, where the winner was to be the applicant who bid the most. LWT threatened not to bid for its franchise again, as opposition to the new franchise bidding process gathered momentum. LWT chairman Christopher Bland stated: &quot;We have the programme power into satellite&quot; – it cost both LWT and Thames £43 million for the licence, yet on satellite television would only cost £2 million. LWT denied it was trying to blackmail the government, but admitted the threat of some of the largest contractors packing their bags might make government think again.

The controversy led to the introduction of a &#x27;quality threshold&#x27; which allowed that, in exceptional circumstances, a bid could be rejected if it were deemed excessive, or that an incumbent could be chosen against a higher-bidding applicant if it were felt that incumbent&#x27;s programming was &#x27;exceptional&#x27;. As described by LWT&#x27;s managing director Greg Dyke, the franchise round, &quot;became a crapshoot. You had to work out [in the franchise round] who was bidding against you. Of those, would they pass the quality threshold and would they pass the financial test&quot;. Scottish Television and Central Television both discovered that nobody was bidding against them—and both bid only a token amount.

It was the &#x27;quality threshold&#x27; that saved LWT. Despite streamlining, and a successful conflict with trade unions, LWT knew that if it were to keep on making quality programmes, it could not over-bid. It had to rely on the quality of its programmes and submit the best offer it could, knowing it could be far less than a rival bid; the strategy worked, and LWT won a third contract with an annual bid of £7.5 million, against a rival who bid £36 million but whose plans were deemed by the new Independent Television Commission to be unsatisfactory.

LWT&#x27;s weekday rival, Thames Television, lost its licence, outbid by Carlton. It was told it could not fall back on its long history of programme-making. After 24 years of existence, LWT survived the station that was its biggest rival. LWT would have a much better relationship with Carlton, and shared many operations including transmission facilities and studio space, and each owning 20% of GMTV, but most notably creating a joint news service, London News Network, to provide regional news programming across the whole week.

From 1993, LWT&#x27;s low bid made it attractive to others wishing to take it over. Originally, Greg Dyke had planned to use LWT as a springboard to start acquiring companies to build a united ITV. On 6 December 1993, the north-west England franchise-holder Granada Television launched a hostile takeover for the company, worth £600 million. The takeover bid came about owing to the relaxation of the rules governing the ITV network. LWT tried to outstep the takeover bid with talks being held with Yorkshire Television and Scottish Television. A week later a conflict of words had broken out between LWT and Granada, with Granada claiming the YTV-LWT deal was &quot;Something cobbled together by desperate men&quot;. Gerry Robinson, the Chairman of Granada plc, was also surprised if LWT went ahead with a bid for YTV, especially since it had made £10 million losses that week and was already paying much of its revenue to the government. Reports also suggested if LWT bid for Yorkshire Television it would also form an alliance with Anglia who would takeover Tyne Tees Television. By New Year&#x27;s Eve, Granada had increased its bid to £658 million.

By 7 January 1994, the merger talks between Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television had collapsed because it had proved impossible to reach an agreement on a suitable structure for the new company. A few days earlier Anglia had withdrawn from the proposed alliance, making an LWT takeover of YTV impossible. By 7 February 1994, Granada had increase its takeover bid again to £774 million, but the LWT board once again rejected the offer. Granada&#x27;s Chief Executive, Gerry Robinson, said: &quot;We are obviously disappointed that having evidently accepted the commercial argument in favour of scale, the board of LWT has not been able to recommend what is a generous offer.&quot; Sir Christopher Bland rejected this statement, claiming &quot;the Granada offer is inadequate and still fails to reflect the true value of LWT&quot;. On 25 February 1994, LWT had succumbed to Granada&#x27;s £770 million bid for the company. This resulted in Greg Dyke and Sir Christopher Bland leaving LWT.

====ITV London====
By 2001, Carlton and Granada controlled all of the franchises in England and Wales, and in 2002 decided to unify the playout and branding of all of the companies to become ITV1, with regional references used only in accordance with regional programming. LWT marked its final day on air with a series of tributes to LWT&#x27;s past, with long-serving continuity announcers Glen Thompsett and Trish Bertram appearing in-vision in LWT&#x27;s playout centre in the London Television Centre. When GMTV handed over to the weekday franchise the following morning, the national ITV1 brand was on-air, with the new team of network continuity announcers announcing for the first time; former Meridian Broadcasting announcer Paul Seed was the first network voice.

The operations of LWT and Carlton Television were merged to become ITV London, a 7-day service. Unlike the other English and Welsh franchises, ITV London did not receive regional idents featuring the London name until the 2003 refresh; only one of these idents was ever used at a single junction from launch. Apart from this rare occasion, the channel was only known verbally as &quot;ITV1 London&quot; prior to regional programmes only. In February 2004 Granada and Carlton completed their merger to become ITV plc, owning eleven of the fifteen ITV regional franchises.

The LWT logo continued to appear at the end of its programmes until 31 October 2004. However, from 1 November, it was replaced by the new Granada Productions endcap, with programmes either credited as &quot;A Granada London Production&quot;, or &quot;A Granada Production&quot; instead. On 16 January 2006, all network productions produced by any ITV plc-owned company were branded as &quot;ITV Productions&quot;, which since 2009 has been rebranded as &quot;ITV Studios&quot;.

==Studios==

LWT&#x27;s first studio base was the former home of Associated-Rediffusion, the previous London Weekday franchise holder in Wembley (see Fountain Studios). The Wembley studios were problematic, as their costly conversions to colour was imminent. LWT only had to use Wembley until its new purpose-built studios were opened in 1972.

The new studios, called South Bank Television Centre, included a large tower block named Kent House after the Duchess of Kent who officially opened the complex. It was built on a plot of land named King&#x27;s Reach. The studios&#x27; network ident was KRS, for King&#x27;s Reach Studios. These facilities were considered at the time the best colour studios in Europe. In 1992 the complex was renamed London Television Centre, and became the centre of ITV plc&#x27;s studio operations and the chief production centre until closing in 2018.

==Continuity announcers==
Ruth Anders, Sue Peacock, Trish Bertram, Keith Harrison, Robin Houston, Pam Royle, Alec Taylor, Glen Thompsett, Annie St John and Peter Lewis served as continuity announcers for LWT.

==Presentation==

LWT&#x27;s initial on-screen look featured the name London Weekend Television in white zooming in on a black background accompanied by an electronic jingle; some shows, such as &quot;On the Buses&quot;, used only a still caption &quot;From London Weekend Television&quot;, either in silence, or over the start of the show&#x27;s theme music. This was replaced the following year by an ident featuring a rotating disc (a stylised laurel wreath) on screen against a grey (later orange) background with the caption in the centre accompanied by a simple acoustic ident theme. The &#x27;&quot;Television&quot; part of the name was dropped on-screen, with LWT merely called &quot;London Weekend&quot;.

LWT&#x27;s most recognisable identity – the &#x27;River&#x27; – was introduced on Friday 18 September 1970, featuring a stripe made up of blue, white and red moving across the black background in the shape of an &#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;W&#x27;; the &#x27;Television&#x27; part of the name remained absent. Designed by graphics designer Terry Griffiths, his modified version introduced on 1 September 1978 revived the full name; at the end, the river sections snapped down into the striped LWT logo. The ident jingle, composed by Harry Rabinowitz, was also remixed. 

LWT dropped in-vision announcers in January 1983, and on Friday 9 September that year, introduced a new local CGI ident, bearing the company slogan &#x27;Your Weekend ITV&#x27;, with an additional ident appearing in 1984.

On Friday 29 August 1986, a new set of CGI idents by The Computer Film Company aired for the first time:
*Genesis, in which the stripes fold on letter by letter, seen on networked productions until December 1987.
*Solari, a vertical venetian blind effect seen in the London region only.
A separate cel-animated ident for children&#x27;s programmes was also used, accompanied by a different version of the station&#x27;s ident theme.

On 1 September 1989, LWT adopted the first ITV generic look and retained it until 30 August 1992, with their three coloured stripes featuring in their segment of the corporate ITV logo. The 1986 &#x27;Solari&#x27; ident returned during 1991/1992 to introduce local programming.

LWT replaced the 1989 ITV generic ident on 4 September 1992 with a large 3D logo forming from the left to a remixed version of the generic music, with two versions: &#x27;Flying Blocks&#x27; and &#x27;Flare&#x27;. On 30 August 1996, an updated ident and logo was introduced, splitting the river colours of red, white and blue on the individual respective letters, L, W and T, with six different versions. On 12 November 1999, LWT adopted the second ITV generic look, based on the theme of hearts. LWT was the only company to drop this look on 24 March 2000, replacing it with the theme of a video wall. The first version of the ident had two problems: the colour scheme was in essence primarily red, and the soundtrack theme consisted of electronic beeps. This ident was altered from July 2000, reducing the red colour scheme and featuring a significantly remixed soundtrack, and another revision on 11 August 2001 included the new ITV1 logo and, from November that year, the itv.com website as well.

By 2001, Carlton and Granada controlled all of the franchises in England and Wales, and in 2002 decided to unify the playout and branding of all of the companies to become ITV1, with regional references used only in accordance with regional programming. LWT marked its final day on air with a series of tributes to LWT&#x27;s past, beginning with an authentic startup routine leading into the ITN Morning News. All elements of the startup were recreated in Macromedia Flash and in the 16:9 aspect ratio, created by Dave Jeffery. Later that day, a recreation of LWT&#x27;s famous River ident would lead into &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, which would be the last programme broadcast under the LWT name. The show was followed by a final signoff featuring continuity announcers Glen Thompsett and Trish Bertram appearing &#x27;in-vision&#x27; to toast the departing station, and a montage of LWT presentation across the years, assembled by senior ITV presentation producer Gareth Randall.

When GMTV handed over to the weekday franchise the following morning, the national ITV1 brand was on-air, with the new team of announcers announcing for the first time; former Meridian announcer Paul Seed was the first network voice. The operations of LWT and Carlton Television were merged to become ITV London, a seven-day service. Unlike the other English and Welsh franchises, ITV London did not receive regional idents featuring the London name until the 2003 refresh; only one of these idents was ever used at a single junction from launch. Apart from this rare occasion, the channel was only known verbally as &quot;ITV1 London&quot; prior to regional programmes only.

On 2 February 2004, Granada and Carlton completed their merger to become ITV plc, holding eleven of the fifteen ITV regional franchises. The LWT logo continued to appear at the end of its programmes until 31 October 2004. From 1 November, the end caption (endcap) was replaced by a Granada endcap, with programmes either credited as &quot;A Granada London Production&quot;, or &quot;A Granada Production&quot; instead. From 16 January 2006, all network productions produced by any ITV plc-owned company carried an &quot;ITV Productions&quot; endcap, and then from the start of 2009 adopted the &quot;ITV Studios&quot; brand.

==Programmes==

===Programmes===
Other notable early shows included &quot;We Have Ways of Making You Laugh&quot; (a sketch show starring Frank Muir which was due to be the first programme scheduled to be aired on LWT, but industrial action blacked it out early in the first show); the children&#x27;s fantasy &quot;Catweazle&quot;; and several sitcoms, including the popular &quot;No, Honestly&quot;, &quot;On the Buses&quot;, &quot;Please Sir!&quot;, &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; and &quot;Mind Your Language&quot;, and cult favourites such as &quot;End of Part One&quot;, &quot;Whoops Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Hot Metal&quot;. The channel also created the comedy-clips format with &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot;, &quot;Clive James on Television&quot; and &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot;; the latter in turn spawned &quot;Beadle&#x27;s About&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot;.

Although as a weekend station, LWT tended to concentrate on lighter material than its weekday neighbours Thames and Carlton, it did produce a number of successful drama series too. &quot;Within These Walls&quot; was a prison drama starring Googie Withers; &quot;Lillie&quot; was based on the real-life story of Lillie Langtry (with Francesca Annis reprising the role from ATV&#x27;s &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;); and &quot;The Gentle Touch&quot;, starring Jill Gascoine, was the UK&#x27;s first drama series with a female police detective as the lead role. However, by far the station&#x27;s most successful drama was &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, a successful attempt to produce a costume drama comparable in scale to BBC1&#x27;s &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;.

Neither did LWT neglect other responsibilities; it established the long-running Sunday lunchtime political series &quot;Weekend World&quot; and a variety of regional programmes including award-winning current affairs series &quot;The London Programme&quot; and the light-hearted magazine show &quot;The Six O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;. It also pioneered multicultural programming via the work of the in-house London Minorities Unit, which produced &quot;Gay Life&quot;, the world&#x27;s first gay television series, and the youth documentary series &quot;Twentieth Century Box&quot;. The company also became heavily involved in social action with the use of on-air and off-air campaigns by the London Community Unit (LCU), later relaunched as LWT Action.

The Sports Department at LWT featured programmes such as &quot;World of Sport&quot; which ran for 20 years on a Saturday afternoon and was billed as ITV&#x27;s answer to BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Grandstand&quot;. Other shows included &quot;Saint and Greavsie&quot;, &quot;On the Ball&quot;, and &quot;The Big Match&quot; (renamed &quot;The Match&quot; between 1988 and 1992). The latter two shows were hosted for many years by ITV&#x27;s main football commentator Brian Moore.

Major programmes on LWT included most of ITV&#x27;s weekend line-up, which included gameshows and comedies like Friday- and Saturday-night favourites &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot;, &quot;The Two of Us&quot;, &quot;Square Deal&quot;, &quot;Close to Home&quot;, &quot;The Piglet Files&quot;, &quot;Second Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Faith in the Future&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;, &quot;You Bet!&quot;, &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot;, &quot;Blind Date&quot;, &quot;Gladiators&quot;, &quot;Barrymore&quot;, &quot;My Kind of Music&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home&quot;, and long-running Sunday night drama series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, &quot;Forever Green&quot;, &quot;The Knock&quot; and &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;. Nigel Lythgoe, who won infamy as a judge on ITV&#x27;s pop talent show &quot;Popstars&quot; and now appears on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, is a former controller of entertainment at the company, working as an executive producer on many of the station&#x27;s top-rating programmes during the 1990s and early 2000s. LWT also owned 50% of London News Network Limited, producers until February 2004 of the news programmes &quot;London Today&quot; and &quot;London Tonight&quot;; regional news for London is now produced by ITN and known as &quot;ITV News London&quot;.

===Regional news programmes===
From 1982 until it launched a proper news service of its own in 1988, LWT also showed Thames Weekend News, produced by Thames Television, on Friday evenings, until December 1987.

*&quot;LWT News Headlines&quot; (1982–1988)
*&quot;LWT News&quot; (1988–1993)
*&quot;London Tonight&quot; (1993–2002; continues on ITV London)

<doc id="226940" wikidata="Q3129472" url="?curid=226940" title="Wharfedale">
<text>Wharfedale ( ) is one of the Yorkshire Dales. It is situated at source in North Yorkshire and then flows into West Yorkshire and forms the upper valley of the River Wharfe. Towns and villages in Wharfedale (downstream, from west to east) include Buckden, Kettlewell, Conistone, Grassington, Hebden, Bolton Abbey, Addingham, Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Otley, Pool-in-Wharfedale, Arthington, Collingham and Wetherby. Beyond Wetherby, the valley opens out and becomes part of the Vale of York.

The section from the river&#x27;s source to around Addingham is known as &quot;Upper Wharfedale&quot;. It lies in North Yorkshire and the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The first or so is known as Langstrothdale, including the settlements of Beckermonds, Yockenthwaite and Hubberholme, famous for its church, the resting place of the writer J. B. Priestley. As it turns southwards, the Wharfe then runs through a green and lush valley, with limestone outcrops, such as Kilnsey Crag, and woodland, generally quite unusual in the Dales.

Below Addingham, the dale broadens and turns to the east. This section is shared between North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire and includes the towns of Ilkley, Otley and Wetherby. The northern side of Lower Wharfedale, opposite Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale and Otley, is in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The Yorkshire Dales Rivers Trust has a remit to conserve the ecological condition of Wharfedale, Wensleydale, Swaledale and Nidderdale catchments from their headwaters to the Humber Estuary.

==History==

The Wharfedale valley was cut into the shape we know today during the last ice age (the Devensian Glaciation). The valley was transformed into its classic U-shaped state between 18,000 and 12,000 years ago by the Wharfedale Glacier, though this was cutting through a channel that had already had a river draining water away to the east through what is now Wharfedale, and also to the north through what is now Bishopdale and then Wensleydale. 

Evidence of human settlement has been found dating back to Neolithic times and the valley has plenty of artefacts relating to the Celtic, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The Romans built a road over Stake Moss into what is now the village of Bainbridge in Wensleydale. 

The Anglo-Saxon influence remains in modern times, with most settlements in Upper Wharfedale having Anglo-Saxon derived names.

The name of the valley is derived from the principal river that flows through it: the Wharfe, which comes from the Old English &quot;Weorf&quot; or Old Norse &quot;Hverfr&quot;, with both taken as meaning &quot;winding river&quot;. The River Wharfe starts at the confluence (at the hamlet of Beckermonds) of the Oughtershaw Beck and the Green Field Beck, each of which originates at the Pennine watershed, some north-east of Ribblehead. The valley roughly follows a south-easterly direction, providing a border between West Yorkshire (on the south side) and North Yorkshire. 

Between Oughtershaw Moss and Wetherby, the valley runs for . The uppermost part of the valley is known as Langstrothdale. Below Beckermonds the river is known as the River Wharfe. Wetherby is traditionally seen as the foot of Wharfedale, even though the river continues on through the Vale of York.

The valley has been used largely for agriculture, and is now criss-crossed with stone walls and stone barns that evidence its use down the centuries.

==Geology==
The geology of the valley is split, with Upper Wharfedale consisting of carboniferous limestone of the Yoredale series. In the lower part of Wharfedale, around Ilkley and Otley, the underlying stone is mostly millstone grit, which can be seen best at the Cow and Calf rocks on the south side of the valley on Ilkley Moor. The Bramley Almanac for 1931 lists &#x27;Earthquake in Wharfedale&#x27; for 15 December 1859.

==Wharfedale Ward==
As an electoral subdivision Wharfedale is a ward in the north east of the City of Bradford metropolitan borough. It consists of the settlements of Burley-in-Wharfedale, Burley Woodhead and Menston along with surrounding moorland. The population of the ward taken at the 2011 Census was 11,836.

==Deanery of South Craven and Wharfedale==

In 2017, in consideration of regional geography, the Church of England changed its subdivisions and re-grouped the Deanery of Wharfedale with that of South Craven, in order that the similar regions can work together more effectively.

==Wharfedale in culture==

One of the most renowned painters of the Victorian era, John Atkinson Grimshaw, portrayed the area in his piece, &quot;Moonlight, Wharfedale&quot; (1871 – oil on card ). He is known as one of the best and most accomplished nightscape and townscape artists of all time, and this painting is a prime example of his mastery. J. M. W. Turner also visited and painted scenes around Otley and Ilkley. Turner was commissioned to paint Kilnsey Crag, which he created as an oil painting in 1816.

The valley was featured in episode three of the BBC Two series, &quot;The Yorkshire Dales&quot;.

On May 27, 1832 the Hambacher Fest took place in the castle of Hambach, an event which marks the beginning of the German democracy. The district was formed in 1969 by merging the districts Landau and Bergzabern. At first the name of the new district was &quot;Landau-Bad Bergzabern&quot;, it was renamed to &quot;Südliche Weinstraße&quot; in 1978.

==Geography==
The district is named after the first touristic route built in Germany in the 1930s, the German Wine Route &quot;(Deutsche Weinstraße)&quot;. It starts in Bockenheim an der Weinstraße, goes through Bad Dürkheim, Deidesheim, and after 85 kilometers ends in Schweigen-Rechtenbach (near Bad Bergzabern).

The river Lauter forms part of the boundary with France in the south.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is very similar to the one of the previous district Landau. In the top-left is the lion of the Electorate of the Palatinate. The white bar in the middle symbolizes the &quot;Weinstraße&quot;, the touristic route which gave the district its name. The bottom-right show two bunches of grapes, again symbolizing the route. The cross stands for Speyer, as the diocese of Speyer owned land in the district historically. The crown in the middle is taken from the coat of arms of the Bad Bergzabern district, symbolizing the Trifels and Annweiler areas.

<text>The Pentagon (ru: Пентагон) home computer was a clone of the British-made Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128.
It was manufactured by amateurs in the former Soviet Union, following freely distributable documentation. Its PCB was copied all over the ex-USSR in 1991-1996, which made it a widespread ZX Spectrum clone.
The name &quot;Pentagon&quot; derives from the shape of the original PCB (Pentagon 48), with a diagonal cut in one of the corners.
Many simple devices (upgrades) were invented to connect to the Pentagon with some soldering.

==Versions==
*Pentagon 48K (1989 by Vladimir Drozdov)
*Pentagon 128K (1991)
*Pentagon 128K 2+ (1991 by ATM)
*Pentagon 128K 3+ (1993 by Solon)

*Pentagon-1024SL v2.x (2006 by Alex Zhabin)
*Pentagon ver.2.666 (2009 by Alex Zhabin)

The Pentagon 1024SL v2.3 included most of the upgrades of the standard Spectrum architecture, including 1024 KB RAM, Beta 128 Disk Interface and ZX-BUS slots (especially for IDE and General Sound cards). This model also featured a &quot;turbo&quot; mode (7 MHz instead of the original&#x27;s 3.50 MHz).

===Upgrades from the original ZX Spectrum===
* Extra RAM ranging from 256 KB to 4 MB
* Several sound card possibilities such as Covox (usually named as &quot;SounDrive&quot;) or DMA UltraSound
* Additional video modes: 512x192 monochrome, 384x304, 256x192x15 (with no Attribute clash)
* CMOS with persistent real-time clock
* IDE Controller for hard drives
* &quot;Turbo Mode&quot; that clocks the CPU up to 7 MHz

<doc id="226947" wikidata="Q1023911" url="?curid=226947" title="CNBC Europe">
<text>Consumer News and Business Channel Europe (referred to on air simply as CNBC) is a business and financial news television channel which airs across Europe. The station is based in London, where it shares the Adrian Smith-designed 10 Fleet Place building with organisations including Dow Jones &amp; Company. Along with CNBC Asia, the channel is operated by the Singapore-headquartered CNBC subsidiary company CNBC International, which is in turn wholly owned by NBCUniversal.

As the most viewed pan-European financial TV channel according to the 2010 EMS survey, the broadcaster reaches over 100 million households across the continent. CNBC Europe produces four hours of live programming each weekday and airs reports and content for its global sister stations and the outlets of NBC News.

==History==

===1990s===

CNBC Europe began broadcasts in March 1996, as a wholly owned subsidiary of NBC. On 9 December 1997, the channel announced that it would merge with the Dow Jones news channel in Europe, European Business News (EBN), which had been on air since 1995. The merger took place in February 1998, upon which the channel then became known officially as &quot;CNBC Europe – A Service of NBC and Dow Jones&quot;. The channel also aired on NBC Europe during the European business day until its closure in mid-1998.

===2000s===

CNBC Europe has leaned generally on the U.S. CNBC on-air graphical look in the past. However, in June 2003, it revamped a number of its programmes, taking many of them away from the U.S. formats. CNBC Europe re-launched its on-air image in September 2004, but instead of adapting the U.S. title sequences for programmes, designed all of its title sequences itself from scratch (while still using the U.S. music adopted in September 2003).

In July 2005, NBC Universal announced that it would be acquiring the Dow Jones stake in CNBC Europe, subject to required regulatory clearances. On 30 December 2005, CNBC Europe became a wholly owned subsidiary of NBC Universal. Dow Jones continues to provide content to the channel. On 1 January 2006, in line with this, the channel dropped the &quot;A Service of NBC Universal and Dow Jones&quot; tagline.

On 18 September 2006, CNBC Europe debuted a new graphics package, which is similar to that used by its U.S. counterpart (first seen in the United States on 19 December 2005). Like CNBC Asia (which debuted a new graphics package similar to CNBC U.S. and Europe on 30 October 2006), it elected to keep the previous theme music (CNBC Asia did so until March 2007). In addition, CNBC Europe also elected to keep its September 2004 opening titles for most programmes.

The channel adopted a new schedule on 26 March 2007 which included a new pan-regional programme, &quot;Capital Connection&quot;. New title sequences were given to &quot;Power Lunch Europe&quot; and &quot;Europe Tonight&quot; to coincide with changes to the form and content of those programmes, but unlike CNBC Asia, no other changes were made to the channel&#x27;s on air look on this date (although &quot;Capital Connection&quot; uses CNBC Asia&#x27;s new graphics as it is produced by that channel).

On 7 January 2008, the channel unveiled a revamped studio and new &quot;lower thirds&quot;. The lower-third style was distinct to CNBC Europe, but adopted some elements of the CNBC U.S. style.

On 29 September 2008 the channel dropped &quot;Europe&quot; from its on-screen name, returning to the CNBC brand it had previously used for a spell in the 1990s. This positioned the station in-line with its U.S. and Asian counterparts, which are also referred to simply as CNBC. Some minor on-screen changes were introduced to coincide with the rebrand.

On 1 December 2008 the channel relaunched its flagship programme &quot;Squawk Box Europe&quot;, with a new look not derived from CNBC U.S. at all. At the same time a third line was added to the ticker detailing general news stories.

On 15 December 2008 the channel announced that long running show &quot;Power Lunch Europe&quot; would be removed from the schedule and be replaced, in both Ireland and the United Kingdom only, with a 12-week run of &quot;Strictly Money&quot;, a new programme focussing specifically on UK issues. This marked the creation of a new UK/Ireland opt-out for CNBC Europe. The new schedule aired from 12 January 2009, with &quot;Strictly Money&quot; remaining in the schedule until its cancellation in March 2011.

CNBC Europe debuted a new lower thirds, which were completely different from its sister U.S. and Asian channels, on 27 July 2009.

===2010s===

On 22 January 2010, the station ended its encryption on digital satellite television in the UK to increase its viewer footprint to an estimated 11 million households. The channel was subsequently added to Freesat on 23 February 2010.

A significantly revamped studio was unveiled in May 2011 along with a new format for various programmes.

The network was formally merged with CNBC Asia in December 2011 to form a new Singapore-based company, CNBC International, to manage the two stations. As a result of the merger CNBC Asia managing director Satpal Brainch was appointed to lead the new company, with his European counterpart Mick Buckley leaving his post.

On 31 March 2014, CNBC Europe launched in widescreen (16:9) and changed its lower thirds to match the on-air style of its sister CNBC Asia channel, which also launched in widescreen on the same day. The new look also saw the removal of the on-screen clock, which CNBC Europe had shown during live European and American programming since the channel was launched. This new on-air style did not carry over to CNBC US, which continued to use the old on-air style. CNBC US would ultimately follow with its own launch in 16:9 widescreen on 13 October 2014. An on-screen clock returned on this day (13 October) but it was a world clock with the time from various financial capitals shown on a rotating basis. CNBC Europe&#x27;s on-air style (which was based on the US design used since 13 October 2014) was launched 9 March 2015, exactly a month after its sister Asia channel.

On 10 November 2015, CNBC announced cutbacks to its international television operation, including the closure of its Paris and Tokyo bureaus, and a two-hour reduction in local programming from London (which will be filled with more programming from the U.S. feed). The cuts, which will result in the layoff of 15 employees, comes as part of a wider focus on providing European market coverage via digital platforms, such as the CNBC website. The programming cutbacks from London took effect on 4 January 2016. Only two programmes, &quot;Squawk Box Europe&quot; and the European version of &quot;Street Signs&quot; (the latter debuted on the same day), are produced out of CNBC Europe&#x27;s Fleet Place studios in London.

On 1 February 2019, CNBC Europe launched free-to-air in HD on Astra 28.2°E.
and 19 June 2021, change frequency free-to-air in HD on Astra 28.2°E to 12,168 GHz.

===2020s===

On 12 November 2020, CNBC Europe launched free-to-air in HD on Hot Bird 13°E.

On 9 September 2024, CNBC Europe updated its on-air presentation and branding to match the CNBC US branding that was first introduced on 11 December 2023. This was also CNBC Europe&#x27;s first new graphics launch in exactly nine and a half years.

==Ratings==
Unlike its American sister station, CNBC Europe does not have its ratings measured on a daily basis: the channel resigned its membership of the UK&#x27;s Broadcasters&#x27; Audience Research Board in September 2004 in protest at its refusal to incorporate out-of-home viewing into its audience figures. The network instead focuses its viewership measure strictly towards the top 20% income bracket, where figures are compiled as part of Synovate&#x27;s European Media and Marketing Survey (EMS). CNBC Europe&#x27;s monthly viewership grew steadily from 1.7 million to 6.7 million in the decade after its 1998 merger with European Business News, with annual growth coming in at around 10%. In the EMS survey covering 2010, the network&#x27;s monthly reach was reported to be 6.8 million.

==Programming==

===European Business Day===

====Current programming====
CNBC Europe produces live business day programming from 7h to 11h CET. The major business day programmes, all broadcast from London, on CNBC Europe are:

* &quot;Squawk Box Europe&quot; – Steve Sedgwick and Karen Tso
* &quot;Street Signs&quot; – Julianna Tatelbaum
* &quot;Decision Time&quot; (for live coverage of UK and European Central Bank lender rate announcements) – Joumanna Bercetche

However, on trading days over the Christmas and new year period, CNBC Europe&#x27;s output is reduced, limited to shorter editions of &quot;Squawk Box Europe&quot; - &quot;Street Signs&quot; is not shown during this period. Those hours are replaced by reruns of magazine programmes. Simulcasts of programmes originating from CNBC US and CNBC Asia remain unaffected. although CNBC Asia also operates a reduced schedule during this period. Regular programming resumes immediately after the New Year&#x27;s Day holiday.

In addition, CNBC Europe produces other business-related programmes. These programmes are premiered at 23h CET and repeated at various times over the weekend. These are:

* &quot;Access: Middle East&quot;
* &quot;The Edge&quot;
* &quot;Marketing Media Money&quot;
* &quot;The CNBC Conversation&quot;

During the business day, the CNBC Europe Ticker is displayed during both programmes and commercials, providing information on share prices from the leading European stock exchanges (this means that advertisements on CNBC Europe are formatted differently from those on most television channels, taking up only part of the screen). When programming from CNBC Asia is shown, that network&#x27;s ticker is displayed. A stack (or bug) providing index and commodity prices was displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the screen until December 2005, when it was replaced with a strip across the top of the screen (in line with the other CNBC channels). The ticker was decreased in size at the same time. The bug was moved back to the bottom right hand corner of the screen on 13 October 2014.

====Extended programming====
On the day each month when the bank lending rates are announced, CNBC Europe broadcasts &quot;Decision Time&quot;, which airs between 1300 CET and 1500 CET.

The channel provides extra programming during the annual January gathering in Davos of the World Economic Forum, frequently opting out of American programming to provide extra coverage, such as interviews and other events. And CNBC Europe broadcasts a nightly 60-minute early evening programme from the event which, in 2025, aired at 17.00 CET.

The channel also occasionally opts out of American programming for one-off interviews or for coverage of a specific event.

In the past, CNBC Europe broadcast extended programming on American bank holidays. In the mid 2000s, this took the form of an extended edition of &quot;Power Lunch Europe&quot; and during 2009 and 2010 CNBC had broadcast &quot;Strictly Money&quot; to the whole of Europe. In 2012 and 2013 the network broadcast a three-hour edition of &quot;Worldwide Exchange&quot; and a two-hour edition of &quot;European Closing Bell&quot;. In 2014 and 2015, CNBC Europe did not broadcast any extended programming on U.S. bank holidays, although on many of the 2016 American bank holidays, CNBC Europe broadcast two-hour editions of &quot;Street Signs&quot;.

====Past programming====

===Rebroadcasts of CNBC U.S. and CNBC Asia===
In addition to its own programming, CNBC Europe also broadcasts almost all of the business day programming from CNBC U.S., and has done so since the start of 2016. Prior to this, CNBC Europe had aired considerably more locally produced programming and the full schedule had only been seen on Europe-wide bank holidays which were regular working days in the United States, and between Christmas and the new year when CNBC Europe produced less European programming.

As of 2024, &quot;Worldwide Exchange&quot;, &quot;Squawk on the Street&quot;, &quot;Money Movers&quot;, &quot;Fast Money Half Time Report&quot;, &quot;The Exchange&quot;, &quot;Power Lunch&quot; and &quot;Closing Bell&quot; are broadcast in their entirety. &quot;Squawk Box&quot; is also usually shown in full. However, on the day when CNBC Europe broadcasts its coverage of the monthly announcements of the UK and European Central Bank lender rates, only the first hour of &quot;Squawk Box&quot; is shown on CNBC Europe. 

On Fridays, the first half of &quot;Fast Money&quot; and the Friday edition of &quot;Last Call&quot; are also broadcast live. although &quot;Fast Money&quot; is occasionally seen live during major events as a way of providing continued live programming, and in some years, &quot;Fast Money&quot; was shown between November and March on a tape delay to fill the one-hour gap between the end of &quot;Street Signs&quot; and the start of &quot;Capital Connection&quot;, created by Europe not being on Daylight Saving Time. However in 2023/24, this hour is being filled with a tape-delay showing of &quot;Last Call&quot;. &quot;Mad Money&quot; has yet to be seen on CNBC Europe.

While the U.S. markets are open, the CNBC Europe Ticker is modified to carry U.S. share prices. A break filler, consisting of &quot;HotBoards&quot; (CNBC&#x27;s custom stock price graphs) is often broadcast during U.S. programming, owing to the increased number of advertising breaks. In addition, for many years, during the evening a recorded &quot;Europe Update&quot;, a 90-second run down of the European closing prices, and for a time in 2013 this concept was extended into daytime when CNBC Europe broadcast brief European updates twice an hour when the network was broadcasting CNBC U.S.&#x27;s Squawk programmes. These segments were broadcast live and, as with the recorded evening updates, were inserted into commercial breaks. &quot;Europe Update&quot; has now been discontinued and has been replaced with an insert detailing current items on CNBC Europe&#x27;s website.

The channel also broadcasts live the majority of CNBC Asia&#x27;s output. However broadcasts of CNBC Asia&#x27;s live programming had been scaled back in the late 2000s as the channel had broadcast teleshopping and, latterly, poker programming overnight. During the period when poker was shown, CNBC Europe only broadcast the final hour (final two hours between April and October) of Asian programming, apart from late Sunday night/early Monday morning when the channel broadcast CNBC Asia&#x27;s full morning line-up. In 2009, the majority of Asian programming was reinstated although the entire broadcast day of CNBC Asia is still only shown on Sunday night/early Monday morning.

===Other programmes===
For two hours each weeknight and all weekend the channel does not air live business programming. The weeknight non-business output runs from 10 pm until midnight UK time and consists of an edition of a weekly business magazine show, an edition of &quot;Late Night With Seth Meyers&quot; and a live broadcast of &quot;NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt&quot;. At the weekend, programming consists of weekly business programmes such as &quot;Managing Asia&quot;, CNBC USA reality programme &quot;The Profit&quot;, news and current affairs, sport, several editions of chat show &quot;Late Night With Seth Meyers&quot;, paid religious programming and special programmes, such as &quot;CNBC on Assignment&quot;, dedicated to the world of financial news and politics.

The channel also broadcasts four hours of sports programming under the banner of &quot;CNBC Sports&quot;. The block airs on Saturday and Sunday between 10 am and 2 pm UK time. The middle two hours are devoted to highlights of the US PGA Golf Tour with the rest made up of other highlights and of magazine show &quot;Mobil 1 The Grid&quot;.

The channel airs some programmes from sister network NBC. These include NBC talk show &quot;Late Night With Seth Meyers&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, which is broadcast each night, apart from on Sundays. The channel also airs NBC&#x27;s Sunday morning political talk show &quot;Meet The Press&quot;, showing it a few hours after its live broadcast.

====Paid programming====
CNBC Europe carries paid Christian televangelist religious programmes. They are shown in a two-hour block on Sundays, between 7am and 9am, plus one 30-minute programme broadcast on Saturday mornings.

Previously, the channel had given over much of the overnight hours to teleshopping. Most teleshopping output was broadcast at the weekend although for a time in the mid-2000s, teleshopping was broadcast overnight during the week. Teleshopping ended on CNBC Europe in the early 2010s.

====Former programming====
=====CNBC Life=====
In February 2008 a weekend nine-hour &quot;CNBC Life&quot; strand, was launched. This slot, which ran during the afternoon and evening, incorporated the already established weekend afternoon sporting coverage of sports such as PGA Tour golf, tennis and yachting with new programming which included travel programmes produced by the Travel Channel, output from The Luxury Channel, news and current affairs broadcasts as well as the airing of programs from sister channels, such as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. In September 2010 CNBC Europe began airing a series of operas and ballets on Sunday afternoons under the title of CNBC Performance. The 20-part series began in September 2010 and ran until the end of January 2011. This programming was repeated during the rest of 2011.

Since 2012 CNBC Life began to be wound down in favour of a schedule more focused on its core remit of business programming and the lifestyle, travel and CNBC Performance elements started to be removed from the schedule. The CNBC Life branding finally disappeared in 2018.

=====Simulcasts of MSNBC=====
The channel used to air American news channel MSNBC during weekend overnights and during the afternoon on American public holidays. CNBC Europe also carried MSNBC during major non-business related breaking news.

By the end of the 2000s, CNBC Europe had stopped showing MSNBC and pre-recorded business-related programming replaced the MSNBC broadcasts. Coverage of non-business related breaking news now comes from either CNBC U.S. or NBC News.

===Simulcasts outside Europe===
All of CNBC Europe&#x27;s live programming is broadcast in their entirety in the U.S. on CNBC World and &quot;Squawk Box Europe&quot; and &quot;Street Signs&quot; are shown on CNBC Asia.

The CNBC Europe ticker is seen on CNBC World but not on CNBC Asia and CNBC U.S.

==Affiliate channels and partnerships==
There is a feed of CNBC Europe for Scandinavian countries called CNBC Nordic. It shows identical programmes to CNBC Europe but has a ticker focussing on Scandinavian stock exchanges.

The channel also operates a separate feed for the United Kingdom. Before late 2008 this was used only occasionally, usually for advertising purposes. The network has since begun to actively market the feed to potential advertisers, and at the start of 2009 its first UK-specific programming, &quot;Strictly Money&quot;, began, initially as a 12-week experiment but the programme continued to air until March 2011. Now the only UK-specific programming is the occasional weekend teleshopping broadcast. Viewers in Ireland also receive this feed.

The following European channels also fall under the CNBC brand:
*CNBC-e, the defunct Turkish version of CNBC. This is unique in the CNBC family, in that after business day hours, it broadcasts popular general entertainment programmes and films, plus children&#x27;s programming from Nickelodeon. Owned and operated under license by Doğuş Holding. NBCUniversal&#x27;s share was acquired in 2015 by Discovery Communications and renamed TLC. The channel was reopened in 2024 with a new partner company.
*Class CNBC (formerly CFN-CNBC), the Italian version of the network, operated in conjunction with Class Editori and Mediaset.
*CNBC Arabiya, the Arabic version of the channel. Owned and operated under license by Middle East Business News.
*On 10 July 2007, CNBC Europe announced the creation of a new Polish business channel, TVN CNBC Biznes, operated under license by TVN. The channel launched on 3 September, and shares resources with CNBC Europe through a permanent link to their London headquarters.

In December 2003, CNBC Europe signed an agreement with German television news channel N24 to provide regular updates from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Correspondents Silvia Wadhwa, Patricia Szarvas and Annette Weisbach report throughout the day in German. In June 2008 the channel also began producing thrice-daily video reports in German for the website of &quot;Focus&quot; magazine.

In October 2022, CNBC Europe signed an agreement with the Greek newspaper Naftemporiki. With that agreement, the newspaper&#x27;s TV channel, Naftemporiki TV, airs the CNBC live programming from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. and from midnight to 7 a.m. on weekdays.

==Other services==
CNBC Europe is narrowcast in London&#x27;s black cabs on the Cabvision network. Since 2005, CNBC Europe also produces the monthly magazine &quot;CNBC Business&quot; (formerly named &quot;CNBC European Business&quot;) in conjunction with Ink Publishing. The magazine is aimed at senior business people and business travellers.

<text>CNBC Asia is a Singapore-based business news channel owned by the NBCUniversal Media Group, a subsidiary of Comcast. It is a pan-Asian branch of the U.S.-based CNBC.

The channel initially launched on 20 June 1997 out of Hong Kong. In 1998, the channel merged with Dow Jones&#x27; Asia Business News and re-located to its facilities in Singapore. The network maintains bureaus across the Asia–Pacific region.

==History==
CNBC Asia was initially announced for a 1995 launch, as a localised version of CNBC for the Asia-Pacific region. The network was expected to feature 10 hours of programming per day from its studio in Hong Kong, along with bureaus in Bombay, Singapore, and Tokyo. The rest of its programming would be sourced from CNBC Europe and its U.S. counterpart. NBC Asia chairman Patrick Cox expected that the network would reach five million homes by the end of its first year on-air. In January 1995, a &quot;preview&quot; known as ANBC launched, which carried a mix of programming from CNBC U.S. and CNBC Europe on Galaxy in Australia and Wharf Cable in Hong Kong. CNBC Asia officially launched on 20 June 1995.

The network would be a competitor to the Singapore-based Asia Business News (ABN), a joint venture between Dow Jones &amp; Company, Tele-Communications Inc., TVNZ, and other local investors which launched in 1993. It was doubted whether two competing business news channels in the market would be viable; ABN CEO Paul France derided CNBC Asia as being &quot;an Asian branch of an American company&quot;. However, as early as November 1995, it was reported that NBC and Dow Jones were considering a merger of their business news channels in Asia and Europe, including ABN and its European counterpart European Business News (EBN).

In March 1997, CNBC Asia expanded its carriage on cable in India via an agreement with the Hinduja Group.

===Merger with ABN===
Renewed negotiations between NBC and Dow Jones surfaced in November 1997 amid financial difficulties at the companies&#x27; Asian and European operations. Dow Jones had been operating at a loss of US$48 million, and CNBC at $40 million.

On 10 December 1997, Dow Jones and NBC announced a 15-year strategic partnership, under which ABN and EBN would merge with CNBC Asia and CNBC Europe respectively, and CNBC U.S. would be able to enter into editorial partnerships with Dow Jones publications such as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot;. The merged operation would retain the CNBC branding, but be overseen by Paul France, and re-locate to ABN&#x27;s Singapore studios—resulting in layoffs of 150 employees from its Hong Kong bureau.

The merger took effect on-air on 2 February 1998, with the channel being rebranded as CNBC–Asia Business News for a transitional period. Citing cost issues and a plan to focus exclusively on Asian business news, simulcasts of CNBC U.S. programmes were dropped from its overnight schedule in favour of reruns of domestic programmes. After the decision was poorly received by viewers, CNBC&#x27;s U.S. business day programmes were reinstated in March.

The merger impacted ABN&#x27;s Indian network, ABNi, which was a joint venture with Hinduja Group and TV18; prior to the announcement of the Dow Jones agreement, Hinduja had sold its stake in the channel, and TV18&#x27;s agreement on the venture did not contain any provisions on what would occur in the event of a change in ownership. After discussions with a CNBC lawyer and France, TV18 would reach an agreement with CNBC to serve as its Indian partner, and would also launch CNBC India (now CNBC TV18) the following year.

In October 1999, CNBC Asia had a partnership with the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; to present &quot;The Australian Financial Review Market Wrap&quot;, a daily round-up of market news from the Australian region hosted by James Walker and Grace Phan. Major programming changes occurred on 30 October 2000 with CNBC Asia expanding &quot;Asia Squawk Box&quot; to two hours, &quot;Asia Market Watch&quot; to two hours in the morning and 1½ hours in the afternoon and &quot;Power Lunch Asia&quot; to one full hour. CNBC Asia&#x27;s ticker was also reformatted on that day to include colours reflecting change in the stock prices (green for an increase and red for a decrease) and a stock&#x27;s ticker symbol.

In 2001, CNBC Asia introduced localised tickers to audiences in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore and has since kept the ticker on the screen during commercial breaks.

In July 2001, &quot;Asia Squawk Box&quot; was further extended to three hours and more programming hours from CNBC US and CNBC Europe were added to the line-up. This was further extended in 2002 when US programming started at 20.00 UTC+8 time uninterrupted on weeknights.

=== 2005–present: Post-merger ===
In July 2005, Dow Jones exited its joint ventures with CNBC, putting them entirely under the ownership of NBC Universal. In March 2007, CNBC Asia announced that it would expand its presence in Australia, including establishing a new Sydney bureau (initially based out of a local GE office, with a studio under construction at the Burns Philp Building across from Sydney Exchange Square), and premiering a new hour-long program preceding &quot;Asia Squawk Box&quot;—&quot;Squawk Australia&quot;—to cover the opening of the Australian markets. The following month, CNBC launched &quot;Worldwide Exchange&quot;, a new international business program that would be simulcast across CNBC in Asia, Europe, and the United States.

CNBC Asia also launched two brand new shows that replaced &quot;Market Watch&quot; and the CNBC Europe programme &quot;Today&#x27;s Business;&quot; &quot;CNBC&#x27;s Cash Flow&quot;, anchored by Maura Fogarty (first hour) and Amanda Drury (second hour), was originally intensely trader and investor based. Following on from the success of &quot;Worldwide Exchange&quot;, another joint production, &quot;Capital Connection&quot; was launched. It was originally anchored by Maura Fogarty in Singapore, and Steve Sedgwick in London. Unlike &quot;Worldwide Exchange&quot;, which was originally produced by CNBC Europe (until production of that show was relocated to CNBC US on 4 January 2016), &quot;Capital Connection&quot; was produced by CNBC Asia.

On 27 September 2007, CNBC Asia announced two additional shows from Sydney, &quot;Trading Matters&quot;—a wrap-up of the day&#x27;s market action, and &quot;Australia This Week&quot;. Both shows were anchored by then-newly appointed CNBC anchor Oriel Morrison, formerly of the Nine Network and Bloomberg Television. The shows debuted on 2 and 6 October 2007 respectively, as the channel officially opened its new Burns Philip Building studios. The move also saw CNBC Australia re-introduce opt-outs from the pan-Asian feed for additional airings of &quot;Trading Matters&quot; and &quot;Australia This Week&quot;.

In August 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Channel Nine&#x27;s finance reporter Karen Tso, would be joining the network in October 2008. She became the Sydney-based correspondent of CNBC and anchored &quot;Squawk Australia&quot;, thus replacing Jeffrey James. In mid-2009, CNBC Asia launched a new personal finance show as an opt-out in Australia, &quot;The Barefoot Investor&quot;, with Australian personal finance expert Scott Pape.

In June 2010, CNBC Asia relocated to a new studio at the Singapore Exchange. This coincided with changes to the network&#x27;s lineup, including the cancellation of &quot;Squawk Australia&quot; and re-expansion of &quot;Asia Squawk Box&quot; to a three-hour format, and the new program &quot;The Call&quot;. On 31 March 2014, CNBC replaced &quot;The Call&quot; and &quot;Cash Flow&quot; with the early morning show &quot;The Rundown&quot; and a local version of &quot;Street Signs. Asia&quot; &quot;Squawk Box&quot; also re-located to a new studio in Hong Kong. In 2019, &quot;Asia Squawk Box&quot; returned to Singapore with a new anchor lineup.In June 2023, CNBC Asia set up a new office in Mapletree Business City. Facilities include a master control room, a production control room for social media platforms and a small studio.

On 22 July 2024, CNBC Asia updated its on-air presentation and branding to match the new CNBC US branding that was first introduced on 11 December 2023.

===End-of-year programming===

===Simulcasts outside the region===
In the US, all of CNBC Asia&#x27;s daytime programmes are seen on CNBC World.

In Europe, during the mid to late 2000s CNBC Europe had chosen to scale back simulcasts of CNBC Asia programming overnight in favour of teleshopping and later poker games and CNBC Asia&#x27;s entire morning line-up had only been seen on Monday mornings. During the rest of the week, only the second hour of &quot;Street Signs&quot; and &quot;Capital Connection&quot; were seen on CNBC Europe. However, in 2009, CNBC Europe began showing almost the entire CNBC Asia schedule throughout the week.

Since 23 April 2007, a free live and commercial-free stream of CNBC Asia has been available on CNBC.com every Monday, from 6AM to 4PM SIN time (Sundays 6PM to 4AM ET with DST). At other times, the stream can be accessed by subscribing to CNBC Plus, which costs $9.95/month or $99.95/year.

<doc id="226958" wikidata="Q3923940" url="?curid=226958" title="Non-native pronunciations of English">
<text>Non-native pronunciations of English result from the common linguistic phenomenon in which non-native speakers of any language tend to transfer the intonation, phonological processes and pronunciation rules of their first language into their English speech. They may also create innovative pronunciations not found in the speaker&#x27;s native language.

==Overview==
Non-native English speakers may pronounce words differently than native speakers either because they apply the speech rules of their mother tongue to English (&quot;interference&quot;) or through implementing strategies similar to those used in first language acquisition. They may also create innovative pronunciations for English sounds not found in the speaker&#x27;s first language.

The extent to which native speakers can identify a non-native accent is linked to the age at which individuals begin to immerse themselves in a language. Scholars disagree on the precise nature of this link, which might be influenced by a combination of factors, including: neurological plasticity, cognitive development, motivation, psychosocial states, formal instruction, language learning aptitude, and the usage of their first (L1) and second (L2) languages.

English is unusual in that speakers rarely produce an audible release between consonant clusters and often overlap constriction times. Speaking English with a timing pattern that is dramatically different may lead to speech that is difficult to understand.

Phonological differences between a speaker&#x27;s native language and English often lead to neutralization of distinctions in their English. Moreover, differences in sound inventory or distribution can result in difficult English sounds being substituted or dropped entirely. This is more common when the distinction is subtle between English sounds or between a sound of English and of a speaker&#x27;s native language. While there is no evidence to suggest that a simple absence of a sound or sequence in one language&#x27;s phonological inventory makes it difficult to learn, several theoretical models have presumed that non-native speech perceptions reflect both the abstract phonological properties and phonetic details of the native language.

Non-native speech patterns can be passed on to the children of learners, who will then exhibit some of the same characteristics despite being native speakers themselves. For example, this process has resulted in many of the distinctive qualities of Irish English and Highland English which were heavily influenced by a Goidelic substratum.

==Examples==
===Arabic===
General features among most or all Arabic speakers:

* Confusion between as in &quot;sit&quot; and as in &quot;set&quot; , pronouncing both vowels as , , or .
* Difficulty distinguishing low sounds, as in &quot;bam&quot; and as in &quot;balm&quot; may both be realized as , , or depending on the speaker&#x27;s dialect.
* Confusion between as in &quot;called&quot; and &quot;caught&quot; with as in &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;coat&quot;, both being realized as or depending on the speaker&#x27;s dialect.
* Speakers tend to speak with a rhotic accent and pronounce as or .
* There is struggle in pronouncing alone in its final position; the “ing” syllable. It is often immediately related to the sound, like in: &quot;waiting&quot; instead of and &quot;something&quot; instead of .
* A study conducted with 45 subjects from Egypt, Libya and Saudi Arabia found that speakers had difficulty in pronouncing some English consonants such as , , , dark .

===Catalan===
*Devoicing of final consonants: to .
::E.g. &quot;phase&quot; can be pronounced like &quot;face&quot; (even though Catalan has both and phonemes).
*Vowel length confusions.
*Confusion of , usually realized as 
*Confusion of , usually realized as .
*Confusion of , usually realized as .
*Confusion of , usually realized as or .
*Confusion of , usually realized as ( are only distinguished in Valencian and Balearic).
*Rhotic pronunciation, with pronounced as a trill or a flap .
*Difficulties with word-initial clusters involving , where an epenthetic &quot;e&quot; is usually added.
::E.g. &quot;stop&quot; being pronounced &quot;estop&quot;.
*Simplification of some word consonant clusters.
::E.g. &quot;instant&quot; being pronounced &quot;instan&quot;
*Narrower pitch range, with emphasis marked with extra length instead of extra pitch variation.
*Problems with variable stress.
::E.g. &quot;the blackbird&quot; vs. &quot;the black bird.&quot;
*Problems with contrastive stress.
::E.g. &quot;with sugar or without sugar?&quot; (the second &quot;sugar&quot; is more heavily stressed)

===Cantonese===

* tends to be [d], so &quot;this&quot; is [dis],
* /ə/ tends to be [a], so &quot;whether&quot; is .
* There is less vowel reduction in unstressed syllables, and some variation in the placement of stress. For example, &quot;chocolate&quot; may be pronounced instead of .

=== Czech ===

These are the most common characteristics of the Czech pronunciation of English:
* Final devoicing of voiced consonants (e.g. &quot;bet&quot; and &quot;bed&quot; are both pronounced ), since non-sonorant consonants are always voiceless at the end of words in Czech. Some speakers may pronounce consonant-final English words with a strong vocalic offset, especially in isolated words (e.g. &quot;dog&quot; can be ).
* Czech is alveolar trill. There is a tendency to pronounce the trill in English and in all positions where is written.
* Final -er (-or) pronounced as syllabic alveolar trill (e.g. &quot;water&quot; sounds ). Stressed tends to be realized as (e.g. &quot;bird&quot; ).
* Tendency to realize both and as , since does not exist in Czech.
* Tendency to pronounce the initial cluster as (e.g. &quot;write&quot; ).
* Tendency to realize as or , since does not exist in Czech.
* Tendency to substitute as or , since does not exist in Czech.
* Tendency to pronounce as voiced (e.g. &quot;how&quot; ).
* Tendency not to aspirate the stops (e.g. &quot;keep&quot; sounds instead of ), since these stop consonants are not aspirated in Czech.
* is often realised as , so that &quot;had&quot; sounds like &quot;head&quot; , homophonous with &quot;hat&quot;.
* Schwa does not exist in Czech. Speakers tend to pronounce it as (e.g. &quot;a table&quot; ) or (e.g. &quot;China&quot; ).
* Tendency to realise as or (e.g. &quot;singing&quot; ), because Czech is an allophone of before velar stops.
* Tendency to isolate all words in speech, because the liaison is unusual in Czech. For instance, &quot;see it&quot; tends to be pronounced , rather than .
* The melody of the Czech language is not so strong as in English. Czech speakers may sound monotonous to an English ear.

===Dutch===
These are some of the most notable features a Dutch speaker might have:

;Pronunciation of consonants

* Speakers have difficulty with dental fricatives, often pronouncing as (failing to contrast &quot;then&quot; and &quot;den&quot;) or (especially between vowels). Similarly, the dental fricative is replaced by or , though Belgian speakers may pronounce both and as in word-final position.
* The voiced stops and fricatives undergo terminal devoicing, especially in stressed syllables, causing &quot;feed&quot; and &quot;feet&quot; to be pronounced as the latter. Similarly, Dutch voicing assimilation patterns may be applied to English utterances so that, for example, &quot;iceberg&quot; is pronounced as , and &quot;if I&quot; as .
* Speakers have difficulty with the glottalization of , either not pronouncing it or applying it in the wrong contexts so that &quot;good morning&quot; is pronounced .
* The voiceless stops lack aspiration in stressed syllable-initial context.
* Medial is replaced by such that &quot;better&quot; is pronounced as .
* The postalveolar sibilants tend to be pronounced as their alveolo-palatal equivalents in Dutch: ; beginners may pronounce them as alveolar (and voiceless) or in syllable-final positions, leading to &quot;wish&quot; being pronounced as .
* may be confused with and with in initial position.
* may be strongly pharyngealized, even in contexts where the dark l does not normally appear in English. Beginners may insert an epenthetic schwa between and a following , leading to &quot;milk&quot; being pronounced as .
* could pose difficulties for certain regional dialects which lack /h/, such as in Zeelandic and West Flemish.
* is replaced by , which English listeners may perceive as .
* The alveolar consonants /t, d, n, s, z, l/ are articulated with the blade of the tongue, rather than the tip as in English.

;Pronunciation of vowels

* Speakers confuse between and , so that &quot;man&quot; and &quot;men&quot; are both pronounced as the latter.
* Speakers confuse between and , so that &quot;pool&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; are both pronounced with . Some advanced speakers may employ a glide [ʉy].
* /iː/ is pronounced closer, tenser, and sometimes shorter than usual. Some advanced speakers might over-compensate for the length with a diphthong like [ëi].
* is replaced by . Spelling might cause confusion with /ɒ/ in words like &quot;wonder&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot; and &quot;lovely&quot;.
* British English /ɒ/ is replaced by [ɔ].
* British English /ɜː/ is replaced by the sequence in Dutch /ør/, with significant lip-rounding and r-insertion.
* /eɪ/ is replaced by [eː].
* /əʊ/ is replaced by [oː]. More advanced speakers might use the Dutch diphthong [eːu].
* /aɪ/ tends to be overly long before fortis consonants, giving the impression of a following lenis consonant.

===French===
* Because of the phonetic differences between English and French rhotics, speakers may perceive English , allophonically labialized to , as -like and have trouble distinguishing between and .
* French speakers have difficulty with and many delete it, as most French dialects do not have this sound.
* French speakers have difficulty with dental fricatives and (since these sounds do not exist in French). In France they may be pronounced as and , while in Quebec, Canada, the usual substitution is and .
* Speakers tend not to make a contrast between (as in &quot;ship&quot;) and . (as in &quot;sheep&quot;).

===German===
* Speakers may not velarize in coda positions as most native speakers do.
* German has a smaller pitch range, less consonant cluster reduction, and less vowel reduction.
* German features terminal devoicing, which is often carried over to English (creating homophones in cub/cup, had/hat, etc.)
* German features neither (&quot;the&quot;) nor (&quot;think&quot;), and both are often realised as either /s/ or /f/ (think/sink, thought/fought, etc.)
* German speakers tend to realise (written in English) as (also written in German) when speaking English.
* The German /r/ is realised differently from the English /r/. Whereas in the former case the tongue touches the uvula, in the latter case it does not.

===Greek===

* Greek speakers tend to struggle with the difference between and .
* and can be replaced by or .
* tend to be unaspirated.
* Greek speakers may pronounce the English rhotic as a flap .
* The closest sound to English in Greek is , and speakers may substitute this sound in words like &quot;house&quot;.
* The English vowels [ɪ] (bit) and [iː] (beat) are conflated.

===Hebrew===
* The lack of discrimination in Hebrew between tense and lax vowels makes correctly pronouncing English words such as &quot;hit&quot;/&quot;heat&quot; and &quot;cook&quot;/&quot;kook&quot; difficult.
* The dental fricatives (as in &quot;the&quot;) and (as in &quot;think&quot;) are often mispronounced.
* Hebrew speakers may confuse and .
* In Hebrew, word stress is usually on the last (ultimate) or penultimate syllable of a word; speakers may carry their stress system into English, which has a much more varied stress system. Hebrew speakers may also use Hebrew intonation patterns which mark them as foreign speakers of English.

===Hungarian===
* The dental fricatives and may be realised as and respectively.
* Since Hungarian lacks the phoneme , many Hungarian speakers substitute for when speaking in English. A less frequent practice is hypercorrection: substituting for in instances where the latter is actually correct.
* In Hungarian phonology, in obstruent clusters, retrograde voicing assimilation occurs, so voiced consonants change to their voiceless counterparts if a voiceless consonant follows them and voiceless consonants change to their voiced counterparts if a voiced consonant follows them. While in English, it&#x27;s the other way around. e.g. pronouncing &quot;dropped&quot; as [d r ɔ́ b d] instead of [d r ɔ́ p t]

===Indonesian===

The following are some characteristics of the English pronunciation by Indonesian speakers:
* Merger of and into and .
* Final-obstruent devoicing.
* Difficulty with English vowels, including lack of vowel length.
** → 
* Common occurrence of unusual spelling pronunciations (e.g. &quot;eleven&quot; as , &quot;cow&quot; as , &quot;bite&quot; as or even &quot;what&quot; as ).

===Italian===

Studies on Italian speakers&#x27; pronunciation of English revealed the following characteristics:
* Tendency to realise as (&quot;singer&quot; rhymes with &quot;finger&quot;) or as because Italian is an allophone of before velar stops.
* Difficulty with English vowels
** and are pronounced (&quot;ship&quot; and &quot;sheep&quot; are homophones); 
** (in certain words) and are pronounced (&quot;bad&quot; and &quot;bed&quot; are homophones);
** (in certain words), , and are pronounced (&quot;bat&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, and &quot;bath&quot; are homophones);
** and are pronounced (&quot;cook&quot; and &quot;kook&quot; are homophones); 
**Speakers tend to have little difficulty with , though some might pronounce it as or ). 
**The pronunciation of , , and are variable, pronounced as or .
* The sequence in words like &quot;bottle&quot; is realized as , , or .
* Tendency to realise word-initial with , e.g. &quot;small&quot; . This voicing also applies to and . The main reason is that the letter &quot;s&quot; is always pronounced as before a voiced consonant in Italian.
* Italian does not have dental fricatives:
** Voiceless may be realised as or .
** Voiced may be realised as .
* Since and are typically pronounced as dental stops anyway, words like &quot;there&quot; and &quot;dare&quot; can become homophones.
* Tendency to pronounce , , as unaspirated stops.
* Schwa does not exist in Italian; speakers tend to give the written vowel its full pronunciation, e.g. &quot;lemon&quot; , &quot;television&quot; , &quot;parrot&quot; , &quot;intelligent&quot; , &quot;water&quot; , &quot;sugar&quot; .
* Italian speakers may pronounce consonant-final English words with a strong vocalic offset, especially in isolated words, e.g. &quot;dog&quot; .
* Tendency to realise as ; a trill rather than the native approximant ~, even when the dialect of English they are learning is nonrhotic.

In addition, Italians learning English have a tendency to pronounce words as they are spelled, so that &quot;walk&quot; is , &quot;guide&quot; is , and &quot;boiled&quot; is . This is also true for loanwords borrowed from English as &quot;water&quot; (water closet), which is pronounced instead of .

===Japanese===
* Speakers tend to confuse and both in perception and production, since the Japanese language has only one liquid phoneme /r/, whose possible realizations include central and lateral . Speakers may also hear English as similar to the Japanese .
* Tendency to realize syllables containing unstressed central vowel /ə/ with a vowel based on the written form
* Tendency to insert a vowel, typically /o/ or /ɯ/, after consonants other than moraic nasal /ɴ/, as Japanese lacks syllable-final consonants.
* Tendency to reanalyze English words according to moraic timing and/or pitch accent, leading to unnatural stress/timing

===Portuguese===
Brazilian speakers of English as a second language are likely to exhibit several non-standard pronunciation features, including:

;Pronunciation of vowels

* Confusion of and , usually realized as , and of and , usually realized as .
* Especially in a British context, confusion of and . The Brazilian is equivalent to RP English , and English orthography rarely makes a clear demarcation between the phonemes, thus &quot;cold&quot; (ideally ) might be homophone with &quot;called&quot; . The North American equivalent of British , , may be easier to perceive as it closely resembles the Portuguese diphthong . Speakers may also have trouble distinguishing between schwa and .
* In a British context, the diphthong might also be pronounced as the Portuguese diphthong &quot;eu&quot;, .
* Persistent preference for over (even if the target pronunciation is England&#x27;s prestige accent), and use of within the IPA space (Portuguese is often , what makes it even more due to confusion in production and perception), so that &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, even in RP, might sound like an American pronunciation of &quot;Kent&quot;. Some might even go as far as having instead of for &quot;last&quot;

;Pronunciation of consonants

*Difficulty with dental fricatives and . These may be instead fronted , stopped or hissed .
*Speakers may pronounce word-initial r as a guttural r pronunciations or a trill. These often sound to English speakers as , leading to confusion between &quot;ray&quot; and &quot;hay&quot;, &quot;red&quot; and &quot;head&quot;, &quot;height&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, etc.
* Neutralization of coda , giving preference to a multitude of nasal vowels (often forming random diphthongs with , or also randomly losing them, so that &quot;sent&quot; and &quot;saint&quot;, and &quot;song&quot; and &quot;sown&quot;, are homophonous) originating from their deletion. Vowels are also often strongly nasalized when stressed and succeeded by a nasal consonant, even if said consonant starts a full syllable after it.
* Fluctuation of the levels of aspiration of voiceless stops , that might sound like . 
* Loss of contrast between coronal stops and post-alveolar affricates due to palatalization of the earlier, before vowels such as , , , and .
*The insertion of [i] to break up consonant clusters.
* Palatalization due to epenthetic , so that &quot;night&quot; sounds slightly like &quot;nightch&quot; ( rather than ) and &quot;light&quot; sounds like &quot;lightchie&quot; ( rather than ).
* Loss of unstressed, syllable-final to palatalization, so that &quot;city&quot; sounds slightly like &quot;sitch&quot; ( rather than ).
* Post-alveolar affricates are easily confused with their fricative counterparts , often merging &quot;chip&quot; and &quot;ship&quot;, &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;sheep&quot;, and &quot;pledger&quot; and &quot;pleasure&quot;.
* Absence of contrast of voice for coda fricatives. &quot;He&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;hiss&quot; and &quot;his&quot; are easily confused with each other. Spelling pronunciations are also possible, in which all words that historically contain schwas in their orthography are pronounced as /z/, even when the usual pronunciation would be /s/.
* English is less prone to perfect liaison-style sandhi than Portuguese, Spanish and French might be. Often, two identical or very similar consonants follow each other within a row, each in a different word, and both should be pronounced. Brazilians might either perform epenthesis or delete one of them. As such, &quot;this stop&quot; is produced either or , instead of the native 
* In Portuguese, the semivowels and may be vocalized to their corresponding vowels ( and , respectively). so that &quot;I love you&quot; is pronounced . These semivowels may also be epenthetically inserted between vowels of very dissimilar qualities.
* With the exception of (here represented with a loss of contrast at the end of a word) and , consonants tend to not elide corresponding to or assimilate to the next word&#x27;s phoneme, even in connected speech. This means, for example, occasional epenthesis even if the following word starts in a vowel, as in their native language (&quot;not&quot;&quot; really&quot;).

===Russian===
* There is no in Russian; speakers typically substitute .
* Native Russian speakers tend to produce an audible release for final consonants and in consonant clusters and are likely to transfer this to English speech, creating inappropriate releases of final bursts that sound overly careful and stilted and even causing native listeners to perceive extra unstressed syllables.
* Word-initial voiceless stops , , may not be aspirated by Russian speakers (following the pattern in Russian), which may sound to native English speakers as , , instead. However, at least one study challenges this, with Russian-accented English speakers in the study aspirating the voiceless consonants just as much as General American English speakers, and even more than General American speakers.
* Russian exhibits final-obstruent devoicing, which may also be used by speakers in English.
* Since there are no dental fricatives ( and ) in Russian, speakers may pronounce them respectively as or or and as or or .
* Difficulty with English vowels. Russian speakers may have difficulty distinguishing and , and , and and ; similarly, speakers&#x27; pronunciation of long vowels may sound more like their close counterpart (e.g. may sound closer to )
* English is typically realised as a trill , the native Russian rhotic.
* Likewise, may be pronounced like its closest Russian equivalent, .
* Since there is no in Russian, speakers typically produce or instead.
* The voiced palato-alveolar affricate may be realised as a sequence of a stop and a fricative: .
* The voiceless palato-alveolar affricate may be pronounced as its closest Russian equivalent, .
* The postalveolar fricatives and may be realised as their closest Russian equivalents, and .
* The consonant cluster may be realised as an affricate, .
* The &quot;clear&quot; alveolar may be realised as Russian , sounding closer to English velarised (a.k.a. &quot;dark l&quot;).
* Consonants written twice in English may be geminated by speakers.

===Spanish===

*Vowel length confusions.
*Confusion of , usually realized as 
*Confusion of , usually realized as .
*Confusion of , usually realized as .
*Confusion of , usually realized as .
*Since Spanish does not make voicing contrasts between its fricatives (and its one affricate), speakers may neutralize contrasts between and ; likewise, fricatives may assimilate the voicing of a following consonant.
*Rhotic pronunciation, with /r/ pronounced as a trill [r] or a flap [ɾ].
* Cuban and Central American speakers tend to merge with , and with .
* and often have a fluctuating degree of closure.
* For the most part (especially in colloquial speech), Spanish allows only five (or six) word-final consonants: , , , , and ; speakers may omit word-final consonants other than these, or alter them (for example, by turning to or ).
* In Spanish, must immediately precede or follow a vowel; often a word beginning with + consonant will acquire an epenthetic vowel (typically ) to make &quot;stomp&quot; pronounced rather than .
* In Spanish, the phoneme exists only in (most dialects of) Spain; where this sound appears in English, speakers of other Spanish dialects replace with or .
* Speakers tend to merge and , pronouncing both as a plosive unless they occur in intervocalic position, in which case they are pronounced as a fricative. A similar process occurs with and , because does not exist in Spanish.
* The three nasal phonemes of Spanish neutralize in coda-position; speakers may invariably pronounce nasal consonants as homorganic to a following consonant; if word-final (as in &quot;welcome&quot;) common realizations include , deletion with nasalization of the preceding vowel, or .
*Devoicing of final consonants.
*Narrower pitch range, with emphasis marked with extra length instead of extra pitch variation.
*Problems with variable stress.
::E.g. &quot;the blackbird.&quot; vs. &quot;the black bird.&quot;
*Problems with contrastive stress.
::E.g. &quot;with sugar or without sugar?&quot; 
::(the second &quot;sugar&quot; is more heavily stressed)

===Vietnamese===

Note: There are three main dialects of Vietnamese, a northern one centered on Hanoi, a central one centered on Huế, and a southern one centered on Ho Chi Minh City.
* Speakers may not produce final consonants since there are fewer final consonants in Vietnamese and those that do exist differ in their phonetic quality:
**Final is likely to be confused with .
**Final is likely to be confused with .
**Final is likely to be omitted.
**Final is likely to be confused with , but some Vietnamese pronounce the word &quot;bell&quot; as .
**Final is likely to be confused with by southern Vietnamese.
* Speakers also have difficulty with English consonant clusters, with segments being omitted or epenthetic vowels being inserted.
*Speakers may not aspirate initial , , and , native English-speakers think that they pronounce as and . For example, when Vietnamese people pronounced the word &quot;tie&quot;, native English-speakers think that they say the word &quot;die&quot; or &quot;dye&quot;.
*Speakers often have difficulty with and confuse the following phonemes, which in some cases may depend on where in Vietnam they are originally from:
** with , .
** with , .
** with (especially in southern dialects).
** with .
** with .
** with or .
** with by northern Vietnamese.
** with , , or by northern Vietnamese.
** with by southern Vietnamese.
** with .
** with or .
** with .
*Vietnamese being a tonal language, speakers might try to apply the Vietnamese tonal system or use a mid tone with English words. However, they produce a high tone when the closed syllable is followed by /p, t, k/. They may also associate tones with the intonational pattern of a sentence and become confused by inflectional changes.

<text>Hyoscyamine (also known as daturine or duboisine) is a naturally occurring tropane alkaloid and plant toxin. It is a secondary metabolite found in certain plants of the family Solanaceae, including henbane, mandrake, angel&#x27;s trumpets, jimsonweed, the sorcerers&#x27; tree, and Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade). It is the levorotary isomer of atropine (third of the three major nightshade alkaloids) and thus sometimes known as levo-atropine.

In 2021, it was the 272nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Hyoscyamine is used to provide symptomatic relief of spasms caused by various lower abdominal and bladder disorders including peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, colic, and interstitial cystitis. It has also been used to relieve some heart problems, control some of the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, as well as for control of abnormal respiratory symptoms and &quot;hyper-mucus secretions&quot; in patients with lung disease.

It is also useful in pain control for neuropathic pain, chronic pain and palliative care — &quot;comfort care&quot; — for those with intractable pain from treatment resistant, untreatable, and incurable diseases. When combined with opioids it increases the level of analgesia (pain relief) obtained. Several mechanisms are thought to contribute to this effect. The closely related drugs atropine and hyoscine and other members of the anticholinergic drug group like cyclobenzaprine, trihexyphenidyl, and orphenadrine are also used for this purpose. When hyoscyamine is used along with opioids or other anti-peristaltic agents, measures to prevent constipation are especially important given the risk of paralytic ileus.

==Adverse effects==
Side effects include dry mouth and throat, increased appetite leading to weight gain, eye pain, blurred vision, restlessness, dizziness, arrhythmia, flushing, and faintness. An overdose will cause headache, nausea, vomiting, and central nervous system symptoms including disorientation, hallucinations, euphoria, sexual arousal, short-term memory loss, and possible coma in extreme cases. The euphoric and sexual effects are stronger than those of atropine but weaker than those of hyoscine, as well as dicycloverine, orphenadrine, cyclobenzaprine, trihexyphenidyl, and ethanolamine antihistamines like phenyltoloxamine.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Hyoscyamine is an antimuscarinic; i.e., an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It blocks the action of acetylcholine at sweat glands (sympathetic) and at parasympathetic sites in salivary glands, stomach secretions, heart muscle, sinoatrial node, smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, and the central nervous system. It increases cardiac output and heart rate, lowers blood pressure and dries secretions. It may antagonize serotonin. At comparable doses, hyoscyamine has 98 percent of the anticholinergic power of atropine. The other major Atropa belladonna-derived drug hyoscine (known in the United States as Scopolamine) has 92 per cent of the antimuscarinic potency of atropine.

Hyoscyamine has been described as a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M2 receptor antagonist without significant effects at the other muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. This is in contrast to related antimuscarinics like atropine and scopolamine, which are non-selective antagonists of all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Antagonism of both the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor and M2 receptor has been implicated as having negative effects on memory and cognition. Hyoscyamine has been described as having deliriant effects similarly to scopolamine, atropine, and other antimuscarinics. However, other sources have reported that hyoscyamine potently antagonizes all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes.

==Biosynthesis in plants==
Hyoscyamine can be extracted from plants of the family Solanaceae, notably &quot;Datura stramonium&quot;. As hyoscyamine is a direct precursor in the plant biosynthesis of hyoscine, it is produced via the same metabolic pathway.

The biosynthesis of hyoscine begins with the decarboxylation of &quot;L&quot;-ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17). Putrescine is methylated to &quot;N&quot;-methylputrescine by putrescine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.53).

A putrescine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.10) that specifically recognizes methylated putrescine catalyzes the deamination of this compound to 4-methylaminobutanal which then undergoes a spontaneous ring formation to &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrolium cation. In the next step, the pyrrolium cation condenses with acetoacetic acid yielding hygrine. No enzymatic activity could be demonstrated that catalyzes this reaction. Hygrine further rearranges to tropinone.

Subsequently, tropinone reductase I (EC 1.1.1.206) converts tropinone to tropine which condenses with phenylalanine-derived phenyllactate to littorine. A cytochrome P450 classified as Cyp80F1 oxidizes and rearranges littorine to hyoscyamine aldehyde.
==Bush medicine basis==

A bush medicine developed by Aboriginal peoples of the eastern states of Australia from the soft corkwood tree, or &quot;Duboisia myoporoides&quot;, was used by the Allies in World War II to stop soldiers getting seasick when they sailed across the English Channel during the Invasion of Normandy. Later, it was found that the same substance could be used in the production of scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which are used in eye surgery, and a multi-million dollar industry was built in Queensland based on this substance.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Brand names for hyoscyamine include Symax, HyoMax, Anaspaz, Egazil, Buwecon, Cystospaz, Levsin, Levbid, Levsinex, Donnamar, NuLev, Spacol T/S, and Neoquess.

<text>The Eurasian wigeon or European wigeon (Mareca penelope), also known as the widgeon or the wigeon, is one of three species of wigeon in the dabbling duck genus &quot;Mareca&quot;. It is common and widespread within its Palearctic range.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian wigeon was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas penelope&quot;. &quot;Anas&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;duck&quot;, and &quot;penelope&quot; refers to a duck that was supposed to have rescued Penelope when she was thrown into the sea. Her name derives from Ancient Greek πήνη &quot;pene&quot;, &quot;braid&quot; and ὤψ &quot;ops&quot; &quot;appearance&quot;, from the ruse she used to deter suitors while her husband Ulysses was absent.

==Description==
This dabbling duck is long with a wingspan, and a weight of . The breeding male has grey flanks and back, with a black rear end, a dark green speculum and a brilliant white patch on upper wings, obvious in flight or at rest. It has a pink breast, white belly, and a chestnut head with a creamy crown. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female. The female is light brown, with plumage much like a female American wigeon. It can be distinguished from most other ducks, apart from American wigeon, on shape. However, that species has a paler head and white axillaries on its underwing. The female can be a rufous morph with a redder head, and a gray morph with a more gray head.

==Distribution==

It breeds in the northernmost areas of Europe and the Palearctic. It is the Old World counterpart of North America&#x27;s American wigeon. It is strongly migratory and winters further south than its breeding range. It migrates to southern Asia and Africa. In Great Britain and Ireland, the Eurasian wigeon is common as a winter visitor, but scarce as a breeding bird in Scotland, the Lake District, the Pennines and occasionally further south, with only a handful of breeding pairs in Ireland. It can be found as an uncommon winter visitor in the United States on the mid-Atlantic and Pacific coasts. It is a rare visitor to the rest of the United States except for the Four Corners and the southern Appalachians.

==Behaviour and habitat==

The Eurasian wigeon is a bird of open wetlands, such as wet grassland or marshes with some taller vegetation, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing, which it does very readily. It nests on the ground, near water and under cover. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks. They will join with flocks of the American wigeon in the United States, and they also hybridize with them. This is a noisy species. The male has a clear whistle that sounds like: &quot;pjiew pjiew&quot;, whereas the female has a low growl: &quot;rawr&quot;.

The Eurasian wigeon is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Its conservation status is least concern.

<text>The American wigeon (Mareca americana), also known as the baldpate, is a species of dabbling duck found in North America. Formerly assigned to &quot;Anas&quot;, this species is classified with the other wigeons in the dabbling duck genus &quot;Mareca&quot;. It is the New World counterpart of the Eurasian wigeon.

==Taxonomy==
The American wigeon was formally described in 1789 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other ducks, geese, and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas americana&quot;. Gmelin based his description on Edme-Louis Daubenton&#x27;s hand-colour plate of &quot;Le Canard Jensen, de la Louisiane&quot; and Thomas Pennant&#x27;s description of the &quot;American wigeon&quot; in his &quot;Arctic Zoology&quot;. Pennant had been sent a specimen from New York. The American wigeon is now placed with the Eurasian wigeon and three other dabbling ducks in the genus &quot;Mareca&quot; that was introduced in 1824 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens. The name of the genus comes from the Portuguese word &quot;Marréco&quot; for a small duck. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

An alternative common name is the &quot;baldpate&quot; due to the whitish crown and forehead of the male bird.

== Description ==

The American wigeon is a medium-sized bird; it is larger than a teal but smaller than a pintail. In silhouette, the wigeon can be distinguished from other dabblers by its round head, short neck, and small bill. It is long, with a wingspan and a weight of . This wigeon has two adult molts per year and a juvenile molt in the first year, as well.

The breeding male (drake) is a striking bird with a mask of green feathers around its eyes and a cream-colored cap running from the crown of his head to his bill. This white patch gives the wigeon its other common name, baldpate (pate is another word for head). His belly is also white. In flight, drakes can be identified by the large white shoulder patch on each wing. These white patches flash as the birds bank and turn. In nonbreeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female.

The hens are much less conspicuous, having primarily gray and brown plumage. Both sexes have a pale blue bill with a black tip, a white belly, and gray legs and feet. The wing patch behind the speculum is gray. They can be distinguished from most ducks, apart from Eurasian wigeon, by shape. However, that species has a darker head and all-grey underwing. The head and neck coloring of the female is different from the Eurasian wigeon. She nests on the ground, near water and under cover, and lays 6–12 creamy white eggs. Flocks often contain American coots.

The American wigeon is a noisy species, and in the field can often be identified by its distinctive calls. Drakes produce a three-note whistle, while hens emit hoarse grunts and quacks. The male whistle makes a wheezy &#x27;, whereas the female has a low growl &#x27;.

== Distribution and habitat ==

It is common and widespread, breeding in all but the extreme north of Canada and Alaska and also in the Interior West through Idaho, Colorado, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, as well as eastern Washington and Oregon. The conservation status of this bird is least concern. The majority of the population breeds on wetlands in the Boreal Forest and subarctic river deltas of Canada and Alaska. Although wigeons are found in each flyway, they are most numerous in the Pacific Flyway. Key wintering areas here include the Central Valley of California and Washington&#x27;s Puget Sound. Farther east, the Texas Panhandle, the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, and the Caribbean also support large numbers of wintering wigeons.

This dabbling duck is migratory and winters farther south than its breeding range, in the southern half of the United States, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and the Mid-Atlantic coastal region, and further south into Central America, the Caribbean, and northwestern South America. It is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe, and has been observed in significant numbers in Great Britain and Ireland since at least 1958. In the United Kingdom, American wigeons are most commonly observed in autumn and winter.

In 2009, an estimated 2.5 million breeding wigeons were tallied in the traditional survey area—a level just below the 1955–2009 average. In recent decades, wigeon numbers have declined in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada and increased in the interior and west coast of Alaska. The American wigeon is often the fifth-most commonly harvested duck in the United States, behind the mallard, green-winged teal, gadwall, and wood duck.

== Behavior ==
The American wigeon is a bird of open wetlands, such as wet grassland or marshes with some taller vegetation, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing, which it does very readily. While on the water, wigeons often gather with feeding coots and divers and are known to grab pieces of vegetation brought to the surface by diving water birds—so are sometimes called &quot;poacher&quot; or &quot;robber&quot; ducks. Wigeons also commonly feed on dry land, eating waste grain in harvested fields and grazing on pasture grasses, winter wheat, clover, and lettuce. Having a largely vegetarian diet, most wigeons migrate in the fall well before northern marshes begin to freeze. The American wigeon is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks.

===Breeding===
Breeding begins in April-May. The nest is a depression on dry ground, often some distance from water. It is lined with grass and down and is hidden in vegetation. The clutch is 7–9, cream-colored eggs, which measure on average and weigh . They are incubated for 23–25 days by the female only. The male usually deserts the female before the end of the incubation period. The young are precocial and leave the nest within 24 hours of hatching. They can feed themselves. The young can fly when around 47 days of age.

<text>In the mathematical field of general topology, a meagre set (also called a meager set or a set of first category) is a subset of a topological space that is small or negligible in a precise sense detailed below. A set that is not meagre is called nonmeagre, or of the second category. See below for definitions of other related terms.

The meagre subsets of a fixed space form a σ-ideal of subsets; that is, any subset of a meagre set is meagre, and the union of countably many meagre sets is meagre.

Meagre sets play an important role in the formulation of the notion of Baire space and of the Baire category theorem, which is used in the proof of several fundamental results of functional analysis.

==Definitions==

Throughout, formula_1 will be a topological space. 

The definition of meagre set uses the notion of a nowhere dense subset of formula_2 that is, a subset of formula_1 whose closure has empty interior. See the corresponding article for more details.

A subset of formula_1 is called formula_2 a of formula_2 or of the in formula_1 if it is a countable union of nowhere dense subsets of formula_1. Otherwise, the subset is called formula_2 a of formula_2 or of the in formula_11 The qualifier &quot;in formula_1&quot; can be omitted if the ambient space is fixed and understood from context.

A topological space is called &#x27; (respectively, &#x27;) if it is a meagre (respectively, nonmeagre) subset of itself. 

A subset formula_13 of formula_1 is called in formula_2 or in formula_2 if its complement formula_17 is meagre in formula_1. (This use of the prefix &quot;co&quot; is consistent with its use in other terms such as &quot;cofinite&quot;.)
A subset is comeagre in formula_1 if and only if it is equal to a countable intersection of sets, each of whose interior is dense in formula_11 

Remarks on terminology

The notions of nonmeagre and comeagre should not be confused. If the space formula_1 is meagre, every subset is both meagre and comeagre, and there are no nonmeagre sets. If the space formula_1 is nonmeager, no set is at the same time meagre and comeager, every comeagre set is nonmeagre, and there can be nonmeagre sets that are not comeagre, that is, with nonmeagre complement. See the Examples section below.

As an additional point of terminology, if a subset formula_13 of a topological space formula_1 is given the subspace topology induced from formula_1, one can talk about it being a meagre space, namely being a meagre subset of itself (when considered as a topological space in its own right). In this case formula_13 can also be called a &quot;meagre subspace&quot; of formula_1, meaning a meagre space when given the subspace topology. Importantly, this is not the same as being meagre in the whole space formula_1. (See the Properties and Examples sections below for the relationship between the two.) Similarly, a &quot;nonmeagre subspace&quot; will be a set that is nonmeagre in itself, which is not the same as being nonmeagre in the whole space. Be aware however that in the context of topological vector spaces some authors may use the phrase &quot;meagre/nonmeagre subspace&quot; to mean a vector subspace that is a meagre/nonmeagre set relative to the whole space.

The terms &quot;first category&quot; and &quot;second category&quot; were the original ones used by René Baire in his thesis of 1899. The &quot;meagre&quot; terminology was introduced by Bourbaki in 1948.

==Examples==

The empty set is always a closed nowhere dense (and thus meagre) subset of every topological space. 

In the nonmeagre space formula_29 the set formula_30 is meagre. The set formula_31 is nonmeagre and comeagre.

In the nonmeagre space formula_32 the set formula_31 is nonmeagre. But it is not comeagre, as its complement formula_34 is also nonmeagre.

A countable T1 space without isolated point is meagre. So it is also meagre in any space that contains it as a subspace. For example, formula_35 is both a meagre subspace of formula_36 (that is, meagre in itself with the subspace topology induced from formula_36) and a meagre subset of formula_38

The Cantor set is nowhere dense in formula_36 and hence meagre in formula_38 But it is nonmeagre in itself, since it is a complete metric space.

The set formula_41 is not nowhere dense in formula_36, but it is meagre in formula_36. It is nonmeagre in itself (since as a subspace it contains an isolated point).

The line formula_44 is meagre in the plane formula_45 But it is a nonmeagre subspace, that is, it is nonmeagre in itself.

The set formula_46 is a meagre sub of formula_47 even though its meagre subset formula_48 is a nonmeagre sub (that is, formula_36 is not a meagre topological space). 
A countable Hausdorff space without isolated points is meagre, whereas any topological space that contains an isolated point is nonmeagre. 
Because the rational numbers are countable, they are meagre as a subset of the reals and as a space—that is, they do not form a Baire space. 

Any topological space that contains an isolated point is nonmeagre (because no set containing the isolated point can be nowhere dense). In particular, every nonempty discrete space is nonmeagre.

There is a subset formula_50 of the real numbers formula_36 that splits every nonempty open set into two nonmeagre sets. That is, for every nonempty open set formula_52, the sets formula_53 and formula_54 are both nonmeagre.

In the space formula_55 of continuous real-valued functions on formula_31 with the topology of uniform convergence, the set formula_13 of continuous real-valued functions on formula_31 that have a derivative at some point is meagre. Since formula_55 is a complete metric space, it is nonmeagre. So the complement of formula_13, which consists of the continuous real-valued nowhere differentiable functions on formula_61 is comeagre and nonmeagre. In particular that set is not empty. This is one way to show the existence of continuous nowhere differentiable functions.

On an infinite-dimensional Banach space, there exists a discontinuous linear functional whose kernel is nonmeagre. Also, under Martin&#x27;s axiom, on each separable Banach space, there exists a discontinuous linear functional whose kernel is meagre (this statement disproves the Wilansky–Klee conjecture).

==Characterizations and sufficient conditions==

Every nonempty Baire space is nonmeagre. In particular, by the Baire category theorem every nonempty complete metric space and every nonempty locally compact Hausdorff space is nonmeagre.

Every nonempty Baire space is nonmeagre but there exist nonmeagre spaces that are not Baire spaces. Since complete (pseudo)metric spaces as well as Hausdorff locally compact spaces are Baire spaces, they are also nonmeagre spaces. 

Any subset of a meagre set is a meagre set, as is the union of countably many meagre sets. 
If formula_62 is a homeomorphism then a subset formula_63 is meagre if and only if formula_64 is meagre. 

Every nowhere dense subset is a meagre set. Consequently, any closed subset of formula_1 whose interior in formula_1 is empty is of the first category of formula_1 (that is, it is a meager subset of formula_1). 

The states that in any space formula_2 the union of any family of open sets of the first category is of the first category.

All subsets and all countable unions of meagre sets are meagre. Thus the meagre subsets of a fixed space form a σ-ideal of subsets, a suitable notion of negligible set. 
Dually, all supersets and all countable intersections of comeagre sets are comeagre. Every superset of a nonmeagre set is nonmeagre.

Suppose formula_70 where formula_71 has the subspace topology induced from formula_11 The set formula_13 may be meagre in formula_1 without being meagre in formula_75 However the following results hold:
* If formula_13 is meagre in formula_77 then formula_13 is meagre in formula_11
* If formula_71 is open in formula_2 then formula_13 is meagre in formula_71 if and only if formula_13 is meagre in formula_11
* If formula_71 is dense in formula_2 then formula_13 is meagre in formula_71 if and only if formula_13 is meagre in formula_11
And correspondingly for nonmeagre sets:
* If formula_13 is nonmeagre in formula_2 then formula_13 is nonmeagre in formula_75
* If formula_71 is open in formula_2 then formula_13 is nonmeagre in formula_71 if and only if formula_13 is nonmeagre in formula_11
* If formula_71 is dense in formula_2 then formula_13 is nonmeagre in formula_71 if and only if formula_13 is nonmeagre in formula_11

In particular, every subset of formula_1 that is meagre in itself is meagre in formula_11 Every subset of formula_1 that is nonmeagre in formula_1 is nonmeagre in itself. And for an open set or a dense set in formula_2 being meagre in formula_1 is equivalent to being meagre in itself, and similarly for the nonmeagre property.

A topological space formula_1 is nonmeagre if and only if every countable intersection of dense open sets in formula_1 is nonempty.

==Properties==

Every nowhere dense subset of formula_1 is meagre. Consequently, any closed subset with empty interior is meagre. Thus a closed subset of formula_1 that is of the second category in formula_1 must have non-empty interior in formula_1 (because otherwise it would be nowhere dense and thus of the first category). 

If formula_120 is of the second category in formula_1 and if formula_122 are subsets of formula_1 such that formula_124 then at least one formula_125 is of the second category in formula_11 

===Meagre subsets and Lebesgue measure===

There exist nowhere dense subsets (which are thus meagre subsets) that have positive Lebesgue measure. 

A meagre set in formula_36 need not have Lebesgue measure zero, and can even have full measure. For example, in the interval formula_31 fat Cantor sets, like the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set, are closed nowhere dense and they can be constructed with a measure arbitrarily close to formula_129 The union of a countable number of such sets with measure approaching formula_130 gives a meagre subset of formula_31 with measure formula_129

Dually, there can be nonmeagre sets with measure zero. The complement of any meagre set of measure formula_130 in formula_31 (for example the one in the previous paragraph) has measure formula_135 and is comeagre in formula_61 and hence nonmeagre in formula_31 since formula_31 is a Baire space. 

Here is another example of a nonmeagre set in formula_139 with measure formula_135:
formula_141
where formula_142 is a sequence that enumerates the rational numbers.

===Relation to Borel hierarchy===

Just as a nowhere dense subset need not be closed, but is always contained in a closed nowhere dense subset (viz, its closure), a meagre set need not be an formula_143 set (countable union of closed sets), but is always contained in an formula_143 set made from nowhere dense sets (by taking the closure of each set).

Dually, just as the complement of a nowhere dense set need not be open, but has a dense interior (contains a dense open set), a comeagre set need not be a formula_145 set (countable intersection of open sets), but contains a dense formula_145 set formed from dense open sets.

==Banach–Mazur game==

Meagre sets have a useful alternative characterization in terms of the Banach–Mazur game. 
Let formula_71 be a topological space, formula_148 be a family of subsets of formula_71 that have nonempty interiors such that every nonempty open set has a subset belonging to formula_150 and formula_1 be any subset of formula_75 
Then there is a Banach–Mazur game formula_153 
In the Banach–Mazur game, two players, formula_154 and formula_155 alternately choose successively smaller elements of formula_148 to produce a sequence formula_157 
Player formula_154 wins if the intersection of this sequence contains a point in formula_1; otherwise, player formula_160 wins. 
==Erdos–Sierpinski duality==
Many arguments about meagre sets also apply to null sets, i.e. sets of Lebesgue measure 0. The Erdos–Sierpinski duality theorem states that if the continuum hypothesis holds, there is an involution from reals to reals where the image of a null set of reals is a meagre set, and vice versa. In fact, the image of a set of reals under the map is null if and only if the original set was meagre, and vice versa.

<text>The Ford Cortina is a medium-sized family car manufactured in various body styles from 1962 to 1984. It was the United Kingdom&#x27;s best-selling car of the 1970s.

The Cortina was produced in five generations (Mark I through to Mark V, although officially the last one was only the Cortina 80 facelift of the Mk IV) from 1962 until 1984. From 1970 onward, it was almost identical to the German-market Ford Taunus (being built on the same platform), which was originally a different car model. This was part of Ford&#x27;s attempt to unify its European operations. By 1976, when the revised Taunus was launched, the Cortina was identical. The new Taunus/Cortina used the doors and some panels from the 1970 Taunus. It was replaced in 1982 by the Ford Sierra. In Asia and Australasia, it was replaced by the Mazda 626-based Ford Telstar, though Ford New Zealand, which built the sedan until 1983 and the estate car until 1984, did import British-made complete knock-down kits of the Sierra estate for local assembly from 1984. Cortinas were also assembled in South Africa until 1984, with the pick-up version remaining in production in that country until 1987.

The name was inspired by the name of the Italian ski resort Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, site of the 1956 Winter Olympics. Several Cortinas were driven down the Cortina Olympic bobsled run at that resort, a publicity stunt which Ford called &quot;Cortina Auto-Bobbing.&quot;

==Mark I (1962–1966) ==
Using the project name of &quot;Archbishop&quot;, management at Ford of Britain in Dagenham created a family-sized car that they could sell in large numbers. The chief designer was Roy Brown Jr., the designer of the Edsel, who had been banished to Dagenham following the failure of that car. The Cortina, aimed at buyers of the Morris Oxford Farina and Vauxhall Victor, was launched on 20 September 1962.

Also from 1962, it was manufactured in other countries such as at the Ford factory in Lower Hutt, New Zealand.

The car was designed to be economical to buy, cheap to run, and easy and inexpensive to produce in Britain. The front-wheel drive configuration used by Ford of Germany for the new Ford Taunus P4, a similar-sized model, was rejected in favour of traditional rear-wheel drive layout. Originally to be called Ford Consul 225, the car was launched as the Consul Cortina until a modest facelift in 1964, after which it was sold simply as the Cortina.

The Cortina was available with 1200 cc and (from early 1963) 1500 cc four-cylinder engines with all synchromesh gearbox, in two-door and four-door saloon, as well as in five-door estate (from March 1963) forms. The saloon models featured large, round, &#x27;Ban the Bomb&#x27; taillight clusters. Standard, Deluxe, Super, and GT trims were offered, but not across all body styles. Early Standard models featured a simple body-coloured front grille, earning it the nickname &#x27;Ironbar&#x27;. Since this version cost almost the same as the better-equipped Deluxe, it sold poorly and is very rare today. Options included heater and bench seat with column gearchange (shifter). Super versions of the estates offered the option of simulated wood side and tailgate trim. In an early example of product placement, many examples of the new Cortina featured as &quot;Glamcabs&quot; in the comedy film &quot;Carry On Cabby&quot;.

Two main variations of the Mark 1 were produced. The Mark 1a possessed elliptical front side-lights, whereas the Mark 1b had a redesigned front grille incorporating the more rectangular side-light and indicator units. A notable variant was the Ford Cortina Lotus.

The Cortina was launched a few weeks before the London Motor Show of October 1962 with a 1198 cc, three-bearing engine, which was an enlarged version of the 997 cc engine then fitted in the Ford Anglia. A few months later, in January 1963, the Cortina Super was announced with a five-bearing, 1498 cc engine. Versions of the larger engine found their way into subsequent variations, including the Cortina GT, which appeared in spring 1963 with lowered suspension and engine tuned to give a claimed output of ahead of the claimed for the Cortina 1500 Super. The engines used across the Mark I range were of identical design, differing only in displacement and setup. The formula used was a four-cylinder pushrod (overhead valve) design that came to be known as the &quot;pre-crossflow&quot; version, as both inlet and exhaust ports were located on the same side of the head. The most powerful version of this engine (used in the GT Cortina) was 1498 cc (1500) and produced . This engine contained a different camshaft profile, a different cylinder-head casting featuring larger ports, tubular exhaust headers, and a Weber 28/36 DCD twin-choke carburettor made under licence by Ford.

Advertising of the revised version, which appeared at the London Motor Show in October 1964, made much of the newly introduced &quot;Aeroflow&quot; through-flow ventilation, evidenced by the extractor vents on the rear pillars. A subsequent test on a warm day involving the four different Cortina models manufactured between 1964 and 1979 determined that the air delivery from the simple eyeball outlets on the 1964 Mark I Cortina was actually greater than that on the Mark II, Mark III, or Mark IV. The dashboard, instruments, and controls were revised, for the second time, having already been reworked in October 1963, when round instruments replaced the oblong speedometer with which the car had been launched. Twelve years later, however, the painted steel dashboard, its &quot;knobs scattered all over the place and its heater controls stuck underneath as a very obvious afterthought&quot; on the 1964 Mark I Cortina was felt to have aged much less well than the car&#x27;s ventilation system. Also in 1964, front disc brakes became standard across the range.

Ford Cortina Lotus was offered only as a two-door saloon all in white with a contrasting green side flash down each flank. It had a unique 1558 cc twin-cam engine by Lotus, but based on the Cortina&#x27;s Kent OHV engine. Aluminium was used for some body panels. For a certain time, it also had a unique A-frame rear suspension, but this proved fragile, so the model soon reverted to the standard Cortina semielliptical rear end.

==Mark II (1966–1970) ==
The second incarnation of the Cortina, designed by Roy Haynes, was launched on 18 October 1966, four years after the original Cortina. It had some styling elements in common with the third-generation US Ford Falcon. Although the launch was accompanied by the slogan &quot;New Cortina is more Cortina&quot;, the car, at long, was fractionally shorter than before. Its of extra width and curved side panels provided more interior space. Its other improvements included a smaller turning circle, softer suspension, self-adjusting brakes and clutch, and the availability on the smaller-engined models, for the UK and some other markets, of a new five-bearing 1300 cc engine.

A stripped-out, 1200 cc version running the engine of the Ford Anglia Super was also available for certain markets, where the 1300 cc engine attracted a higher tax rate. The 1500 cc engines were at first carried over, but were discontinued in July 1967, as a new engine was on its way. A month later, in August, the 1300 received a new crossflow cylinder head design, making it more efficient, while a crossflow 1600 replaced the 1500. The new models carried additional &quot;1300&quot; or &quot;1600&quot; designations at the rear. An 1100 cc crossflow engine from the Escort was also offered for markets such as Greece, where higher capacities were taxed heavily. The Cortina Lotus continued with its own unique engine, although for this generation it was built in-house by Ford.

The Cortina was Britain&#x27;s most popular new car in 1967, achieving the goal that Ford had been trying to achieve since it set out to create the original Cortina back in 1962. This interrupted the long run of BMC&#x27;s 1100/1300 range as Britain&#x27;s best-selling car.

Period reviews were favourable concerning both the styling and performance.

Again, two- and four-door saloons were offered with base, Deluxe, Super, GT, and later, 1600E trims available, but again, not across all body styles and engine options. A few months after the introduction of the saloon versions, a four-door estate was launched, released on the UK market on 15 February 1967: much was made at the time of its class-topping load capacity.

The four-door Cortina 1600E, a higher-trim version, was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in October 1967, a year after the arrival of the Cortina Mark II. It combined the lowered suspension of the Cortina Lotus with the high-tune GT 1600 Kent engine and luxury trim featuring a burr walnut woodgrain-trimmed dashboard and door cappings, bucket seating, leather-clad aluminium sports steering wheel, and full instrumentation inside, while a black grille, tail panel, front fog lights, and plated Rostyle wheels on radial tyres featured outside. According to author and Cortina expert Graham Robson, the 1600E would be the first Cortina recognized as a classic.

For 1969, the Mark II range was given subtle revisions, with separate &quot;FORD&quot; block letters mounted on the bonnet and boot lids, a blacked-out grille and chrome strips on top and below the taillights running the full width of the tail panel marking them out.

===Export markets===

Ford New Zealand developed its own variant of this model called the GTE, since the GT and Lotus Cortinas were not assembled there. The four-door only GTE had a wooden dash, a vinyl roof, a blacked out tail panel, semi-high back front seats, centre console with floor shifter and clock, Australian Capri full wheel trims plus special stripes and badging.

A 3.0 L Essex V6 engined variant was developed privately in South Africa by Basil Green Motors, and was sold through the Grosvenor Ford network of dealers as the Cortina Perana; two similar models (fitted with 3.0 L and 2.5 L Essex respectively) appeared later in Britain and were known as the Cortina Savage and Cortina Cheetah, which were available with 1600E trim in all three body styles, while their South African stablemate was offered only as a four-door saloon initially with GT and later E trim.

The Cortina was Canada&#x27;s second-most popular imported car during the 1960s, second only to the Volkswagen Beetle. Canada had two- and four-door sedans, the higher-performance GT sedan, and a DeLuxe wagon. The Lotus Cortina was also available, albeit in limited numbers.

Ford in the United States imported both the Mark I and Mark II Cortina models. The Mark II was sold in the United States from 1967, achieving 16,193 cars sold in its first year. Sales of the Mark II in 1968 were 22,983. Sales in 1969 reached 21,496. Sales slumped in 1970, to almost half their 1969 peak, at 10,216 units. Ford USA dropped the model in 1970 and was effectively replaced with the introduction of the US-produced 1971 Ford Pinto subcompact. Ford sold 352,402 Ford Pintos for model year 1971 and no more English Fords were sold in the United States thereafter.

== TC Mark III (1970–1976)==
In the late 1960s, Ford set about developing the third-generation Cortina, the Mark III, which would be produced in higher volumes than before following the merger of Ford of Britain and Ford of Germany into the modern-day Ford of Europe. The car marked the convergence of the German Taunus and British Cortina platforms with only minor differences between the two, hence the car&#x27;s internal name TC1, standing for Taunus-Cortina. It was also the last European car engineered by Harley Copp as vice president of engineering and head of Brentwood, before he returned to Detroit.

Ford UK originally wanted to call it something other than Cortina, but the name stuck. Although the Mark III looked significantly larger than the boxier Mark II Cortina, it was actually the same overall length, but wider. Within the overall length, a wheelbase lengthened by more than also contributed to the slightly more spacious interior.

The Mark III Cortina was inspired by the contemporary &quot;coke bottle&quot; design language which had emanated from Detroit – the car sported similar fluted bonnet and beltline design elements to the North American Mercury Montego and Ford LTD of the same era. It replaced both the Mark II Cortina and the larger, more expensive Ford Corsair, offering more trim levels and the option of larger engines than the Mark II Cortina. The Mark III&#x27;s continental European sister car – the Taunus TC – was subtly different in appearance, with longer front indicators, different taillights, different door skins, different bonnet and boot lid pressings (and hence a different radiator grille), and rear-wing pressings that toned down the drooping beltline, lessening the &quot;coke-bottle&quot; appearance of the Cortina. Also, the dual round headlights fitted to the upmarket version of the Cortina Mark III were not available on the Taunus TC1.

The MacPherson strut front suspension was replaced with more conventional double A-arm suspension (also known as double wishbone suspension), which gave the Mark III a much softer ride on the road, but did give cars fitted with the larger, heavier engines distinct understeer.

Trim levels for the Mark III Cortina were Base, L (Luxury), XL (Xtra Luxury), XLE (Xtra Luxury Edition – Australia and South Africa only), GT (Grand Touring), and GXL (Grand Xtra Luxury).

The early Mark III Cortinas came with the same 1300 and 1600 cc engines as the Mark II Cortinas, except for the 1600 cc GXL and GT. These engines are known as the Kent, crossflow engine or overhead valve (OHV) engine. Also, the 2000 cc engine, the single overhead cam engine, now known as the Pinto engine, was introduced. The OHV Kent&#x27; unit was fitted with a single-choke carburetor and was used for the early models up to and including XL trim, the SOHC twin-choke carburetor Pinto engine was used for the GT and GXL models. The GXL was also offered in 1600 in the later Cortina Mark IIIs.

In left-hand drive markets, the 1600 OHC was replaced by a twin-carb OHV (Kent) unit not offered in the home market, to distinguish it from the competing Taunus, which only came with the OHC Pinto engine. The 2.0-litre variants used a larger version of the 1600 cc Pinto unit and were available in all trim levels except base. Base, L, and XL versions were available as a five-door estate.

Although no longer than its predecessor, the Mark III was a heavier car, reflecting a trend towards improving secondary safety by making car bodies more substantial. Weight was also increased by the stout cross-member incorporated into the new simplified front suspension set-up, and by the inclusion of far more sound-deadening material, which insulated the cabin from engine and exhaust noise, making the car usefully quieter than its predecessor, though on many cars, the benefit was diminished by high levels of wind noise apparently resulting from poor door fit around the windows. Four-speed manual transmissions were by now almost universally offered in the UK for this class of car, and contemporary road tests commented on the rather large gap between second and third gear, and the resulting temptation to slip the clutch when accelerating through the gears in the smaller-engined cars: it was presumably in tacit acknowledgment of the car&#x27;s marginal power-to-weight ratio that Ford no longer offered the automatic transmission option with the smallest 1298 cc-engined Cortina.

Four headlights marked out the pre facelift GT and GXL versions. Early GT and GXL had Rostyle steel sports wheels similar to those fitted to the Mk2 Cortina 1600E. These were replaced by a 8 &#x27;spoke&#x27; look steel sports wheel at the end of 1971 for the 1972 model year. The GXL also had bodyside rub strips, a vinyl roof covering, and a brushed aluminium and black boot lid panel on the GXLs, while the GT had a black-painted section of the boot with a chrome trim at either side of it. A vinyl roof could be added as a cost option to both 2 and 4 door models. All prefacelift models featured a downward-sloping dashboard with deeply recessed dials, with the GT and GXL having 4 deep recessed gauges in the centre console measuring oil pressure, oil and water temperature and volts, along with &#x27;tombstone&#x27; one piece high back seats with integral headrests. All cars from introduction had coil suspension all round. In general styling and technical make up, the Mark III Cortina aped the Vauxhall Victor FD of 1967.

The Cortina went on sale on 23 October 1970, but sales got off to a particularly slow start because of production difficulties that culminated with a 10-week strike at Ford&#x27;s plant between April and June 1971, which was at the time reported to have cost production of 100,000 vehicles, equivalent to almost a quarter of the output for a full year.

During 1971, the spring rates and damper settings were altered along with the front suspension bushings, which reduced the bounciness of the ride and low-speed ride harshness, which had generated press criticism at the time of the Mark III&#x27;s launch.

Volumes recovered, and with the ageing Austin/Morris 1100/1300 now losing out to various newer models, the Cortina was Britain&#x27;s top-selling car in 1972, closely followed by the Escort. It remained the UK&#x27;s top-selling car until 1976, when overtaken by the Mk2 Escort.

In late 1973, the Mark III was given a facelift, and was redesignated TD. The biggest change was the new dashboard, which dispensed with the steeply sloped and somewhat &quot;overstyled&quot; original. The new fascia was much flatter in appearance featuring the instruments under a glass hood with improved ergonomics which would be carried over to the later Mark IV and Mark V Cortinas with only detail modifications, as well as upgraded trim levels, revised front grilles and rear lights, rectangular headlights for the XL, GT, and the new 2000E (the &quot;E&quot; standing for executive), which replaced the GXL. The 1.3-litre Kent engine continued, but 1.6-litre models now used the more modern 1.6-litre Pinto SOHC engine. While the TD Cortina still had double A-arm suspension with coils at the front and a four-link system at the rear, handling was improved. The 2000E reverted to the classy treatment offered by the MkII 1600E (and carried over to later Mark IV/V Ghia) models instead of the faux woodgrain trim of the GXL. The 2000E was also available as an estate version.

===Export markets===
The Mark III was sold in Canada until 1973.

For South Africa, the Mark III was available as the &#x27;Big Six&#x27; L and GL with the Essex V6 2.5-litre engine and Perana, GT, and XLE with the Essex V6 3.0-litre engine. A pick-up truck version also was available. In addition to the 1.6-litre inline-four, a version unique to South Africa was a locally built version of the 2.0-litre Essex V4. The Cortina 2000 V4 arrived during 1972, and also became available as a station wagon and pick-up later in the year. Maximum power was . The shorter engine required a radiator shroud to compensate. The Cortina GT, however, received an OHC inline-four in South Africa, as well.

Ford Australia built its own versions using both the UK four-cylinder engines (1.6 and 2.0) and locally made inline six-cylinder engines (3.3- and 4.1-litre) from its Falcon line. Along with the engines, Australian built &#x27;Cortys&#x27; (a common slang word Australians use for the Cortina ) featured many paint colours carried over from the Falcon line, some even from the Falcon GT.

Ford New Zealand introduced the Mk3 as a four-door sedan and also reintroduced wagon versions not assembled during the Mk2&#x27;s run. Initially, the 1.3 OHV engine came with base trim, the 1.6 as the Cortina L, and the 2.0 OHC as a GT (sedan only). Later base models were upgraded to the 1.6 OHV and a 2.0 L specification was added, set to become the default &quot;rep&#x27;s spec&quot; until the Cortina&#x27;s Kiwi demise in 1984. A 1973 update brought new paint colours and black, rather than colour-matched, dashboards and carpet. Facelifted Mk3s received the 1.6 OHC replacement for the base 1.6 engine and during the run, a specially trimmed base 1.3 OHV &quot;economy&quot; version was reintroduced, but actually achieved worse fuel economy than larger engine models. A 2.0XL sedan version was also added around the same time. The Kiwi 2000E sedan initially lacked the cloth seats and never had the factory sunroof of the UK version and a radio was never standard, wagons were only ever offered in base or L trim.

Ford Lio Ho in Taiwan began local production of the Cortina in March 1973.

For Japan, the cars were narrowed by a few millimetres on arrival in the country to fit into a lower tax bracket determined by exterior dimensions which impose a maximum width of . The Cortina was joined by the Ford Capri in Japan and was imported by Kintetsu Motors, an exclusive retailer of Ford products.


== Mark IV (1976–1979)==
The Mark IV Cortina (or TC2, as it was the second generation of the unified Taunus-Cortina platform) was a more conservative design than its predecessor, and this was largely appreciated by fleet buyers. Generally, it was a rebody of the Mark III/TC with little mechanical change as an integration of Ford&#x27;s model range, and as a result, the Cortina and Taunus now differed only in badging. Although the updated Taunus was introduced to Continental Europe in January 1976, Ford were able to continue selling the Cortina Mark III in undiminished numbers in the UK until they were ready to launch its successor as the Dagenham-built Cortina Mark IV, which went on sale on 29 September 1976.

Many parts were carried over, most notably the running gear. The raised driving position and the new dashboard had, along with some of the suspension upgrades, had already appeared in the 1974 model year Cortina MkIII, so that from the driving position, the new car looked much more familiar to owners of recent existing Cortinas than from the outside. Cinema audiences saw the new Cortina (or Taunus) chasing James Bond in his Lotus Esprit in the 1977 film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;.

The most obvious change was the new, squarer body in line with contemporary &quot;folded paper&quot; fashion of the time – although it still featured a subtle &#x27;Coke-bottle&#x27; waistline as a reference to its predecessor – along with a lowered boot lid height which achieved the marketing department objective of larger windows giving a better view out and a brighter feel to the cabin, but at the expense of body weight, which was increased, albeit only marginally, by about . Ford claimed an overall increase in window area of some 15%, with &quot;40% better visibility&quot; through the wider, deeper back window. Regardless of how these figures were computed, substantial weight-saving gains must have been made through reduced steel usage in the design, given the unavoidable extra weight of glass.

This series spawned the first Ghia top-of-the-range model, which replaced the 2000E. The 2.3-litre Ford Cologne V6 engine was introduced in 1977 as an engine above the 2.0-litre Pinto engine, already a staple of the Capri and Granada ranges. However, 2.3-litre Cortinas never sold particularly well in the UK. The Cologne V6 was much smoother and delivered more refined power than the Pinto, but the V6 models were more expensive to fuel and insure, and were only slightly faster, being about 0.5 seconds faster from 0–60 and having a top speed of about 109 mph compared to the 104 mph of the 2.0-litre models. The 2.0-litre Cologne V6 engine continued to be offered on Taunus-badged cars in parallel with the Pinto unit, and offers here an interesting comparison with the similarly sized in-line four-cylinder Pinto engine. The V6 with a lower compression ratio offered less power and less performance, needing over an extra second to reach . It did, however, consume 12½% less fuel and was considered by motor journalists to be a far quieter and smoother unit. The 2.3-litre was available to the GL, S, and Ghia variants. A 1.6-litre Ghia option was also introduced at the same time as the 2.3-litre V6 models in response to private and fleet buyers who wanted Ghia refinements with the improved fuel economy of the smaller 1.6-litre Pinto engine. Few cars were sold with the 1.6-litre engine, though; the 2.0-litre Pinto was always by far the most common engine option for Ghia models.

Two-door and four-door saloons and a five-door estate were offered with all other engines being carried over. At launch, though, only 1.3-litre-engined cars could be ordered in the UK with the two-door body, and then only with &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;L&quot; equipment packages. In practice, relatively few two-door Mark IV Cortinas were sold. In some markets, the two-door saloon was marketed as a coupe, but this was not the case in Britain. Ford already competed in the coupe sector in Europe with the Capri, which was particularly successful on the British market.

A choice of base, L, GL, S (for Sport) and Ghia trims was available, again not universal to all engines and body styles. 8 &#x27;spoke&#x27; steel sports wheels were fitted as standard to all Mark IV GL, S, and Ghia models, with alloy wheels available as an extra-cost option for the Ghia. The dashboard was carried over intact from the last of the Mark III Cortinas, while the estate used the rear body pressings of the previous 1970-release Taunus.

Despite its status as Britain&#x27;s best-selling car throughout its production run, the Mark IV is now the rarest Cortina, with poor rustproofing and the model&#x27;s popularity with banger racers cited as being the main reasons for its demise. Particularly scarce are the 2.0 and 2.3 S models, which were discontinued when the Mark V was introduced in August 1979.

Ford Australia built its own version, known as the TE, with the 2.0-litre straight-four engine Pinto unit and the Falcon&#x27;s 3.3-litre and 4.1-litre straight-six engine. The six-cylinder versions were rather nose heavy and did not handle as well as the fours or the European V6 models. Interior door hardware and steering columns were shared with the Falcons, and the Australian versions also had their own instrument clusters, optional air conditioning, and much larger bumpers. They also had side indicators. The Cortina wagon was assembled by Renault Australia at its plant in Heidelberg in Victoria.

A considerable number were exported to New Zealand under a free-trade agreement where they were sold alongside locally assembled models similar to those available in the UK.

In South Africa, the Mark IV was built with the Kent 1.6-litre and the 3.0-litre Essex V6. Beginning in mid-1978, the Cologne-built 2.0-litre Pinto four also became available in place of the old Essex V4. They were sold as L (1600), GL (2000), and Ghia (V6) with four-door saloon or estate bodywork.

==Mark V (1979–1982)==

The Mark V (or TC3) was announced on 24 August 1979. Officially, the programme was code named Teresa, although externally it was marketed as &quot;Cortina 80&quot;, but the Mark V tag was given to it immediately on release by the press, insiders and the general public. Prices started at £3,475 for a basic 1.3-litre-engined model.

Largely an update of the Mark IV, it was really a step between a facelift and a rebody. The Mark V differed from the Mark IV by having revised headlights with larger turn indicators incorporated (which were now visible on the side, too), a wider, slatted grille said to be more aerodynamically efficient, a flattened roof, larger glass area, slimmer C-pillars with revised vent covers, larger slatted taillights (on saloon models) and detail changes to the dashboard and interior, most notably a new extended centre console housing the radio to allow for new centre air vents on the fascia. The styling upgrades were done primarily to bring the Cortina/Taunus into line with Ford&#x27;s current design language seen on the Fiesta MkI, Capri MkIII, and the forthcoming Escort MkIII.

Improvements were also made to the engine range, with slight improvements to both fuel economy and power output compared to the Mark IV. The 2.3-litre V6 engine was given electronic ignition and a slight boost in power output to , compared to the of the Mark IV. Ford also claimed improved corrosion protection on Mark V models; as a result, more Mark Vs have survived, but corrosion was still quite a problem.

The estate models combined the Mark IV&#x27;s bodyshell (which was initially from the 1970 Ford Taunus) with the Mark V front body pressings. A pick-up (&quot;bakkie&quot;) version was also built in South Africa. In 1982, the Cortina Pickup received a longer bed and was from then on marketed as the Ford P100.

Variants included the Base, L, GL, and Ghia (all available in saloon and estate forms), together with Base and L specification two-door saloon versions (this body style was available up to Ghia V6 level on overseas markets). The replacement for the previous Mark IV S models was an S package of optional extras, which was available as an upgrade on most Mark V models from L trim level upwards. For the final model year of 1982, this consisted of front and rear bumper overriders, sports driving lamps, an S badge on the boot, tachometer, four-spoke steering wheel, revised suspension settings, front gas shock absorbers, Sports gear-lever knob, Sports road wheels, 185/70 SR x 13 tyres, and fishnet Recaro sports seats (optional). Various &quot;special editions&quot; were announced, including the Calypso and Carousel. The final production model was the Crusader special edition, a run-out model which was available as a 1.3-litre, 1.6-litre and 2.0-litre saloons or 1.6-litre and 2.0-litre estates. It arrived a few months before the launch of its successor, the Sierra. It was the best-specified Cortina produced to date and 30,000 were sold which also made it Ford&#x27;s best-selling special-edition model. Another special-edition model was the estate Cortina Huntsman, of which 150 were produced. By this time, the Cortina was starting to feel the competition from a rejuvenated (and Opel-influenced) Vauxhall which with the 1981 release Cavalier J-Car, was starting to make inroads on the Cortina&#x27;s traditional fleet market, largely helped by the front-wheel drive benefits of weight. By the time of the model&#x27;s demise in 1982 in favour of the Sierra, the Cortina was effectively a 12-year-old design due to the outgoing Mk4/5 being largely a reskin of the 1970 Mk3.

In April 1980, the Mk V Cortina was released in Australia, where it was known as the TF Cortina. It sold poorly and was quietly dropped in 1981. The &quot;Drive&quot; website later suggested very firmly that the model, in its six-cylinder versions, was a &quot; &#x27;Lemon&#x27; &quot;: as well as &quot;dubious build quality&quot; and a &quot;hard ride&quot;, it had &quot;a large six under the bonnet and no weight in the back&quot;, and was therefore &quot;an ill-handling and unwieldy monster&quot;.

Up to and including 1981, the Cortina was the best-selling car in Britain. Even during its final production year, 1982, the Cortina was Britain&#x27;s second-best selling car and most popular large family car. On the Continent, the Taunus version was competing with more modern and practical designs like the Talbot Alpine, Volkswagen Passat, and Opel Ascona.

The last Cortina – a silver Crusader – rolled off the Dagenham production line on 22 July 1982 on the launch of the Sierra, though a few were still leaving the forecourt as late as 1987, with one final unregistered Cortina GL leaving a Derbyshire dealership in 2005. The last Cortina built in England remains in the Ford Heritage Centre in Dagenham, Essex, not far from the factory where it was assembled.

==Sales success==
In 1967, the Ford Cortina interrupted the Austin/Morris 1100/1300s reign as Britain&#x27;s best-selling car. It was Britain&#x27;s best-selling car for nine out of ten years between 1972 and 1981, narrowly being outsold by the Ford Escort in 1976.

The final incarnation of the Cortina was Britain&#x27;s best-selling car in 1980 and 1981, also topping the sales charts for 1979 when the range was making the transition from the fourth-generation model to the fifth – in that year it achieved a British record of more than 193,000 sales. Even in 1982, when during its final year of production, it was second only to the Ford Escort.

The Cortina was also a very popular-selling car in New Zealand throughout its production and continued to be sold new until 1984.

Although the Sierra went on sale in October 1982, thousands of Cortinas were still unsold at this point. More than 11,000 were sold in 1983, with five examples being sold as late as 1987 when the Sierra Sapphire eventually launched.

Its demise left Ford without a traditional four-door saloon of this size, as the Sierra was initially available only as a hatchback or estate. Ford later addressed this by launching a saloon version of the Sierra (the Sierra Sapphire) at the time of a major facelift in early 1987. It also added an Escort-based four-door saloon, the Orion, to the range in 1983 – attracting many former Cortina buyers.

More than 2.8 million Cortinas were sold in Britain during its 20-year, five-generation production run, and in March 2009, the Cortina was still the third-most popular car ever sold there, despite having been out of production for nearly three decades. Such was its popularity that though it was only produced for three years of the 1980s, the Cortina was still Britain&#x27;s seventh-best selling car of that decade with almost 500,000 sales. It remained a popular buy on the used market and a common sight on British roads until well into the 1990s.

As of December 2019, 3,826 Cortinas are still registered on the road, with a further 3,480 currently SORN. With the supply of good European built examples dwindling, enthusiasts have increasingly imported South African and New Zealand-built Cortinas into the UK. The warm, dry climate of these countries means that fewer cars have succumbed to corrosion and they have the added benefit of being right-hand drive. Such was the growth of imports that in December 2023 there were 4,658 Cortinas registered for the road; one of the few examples of a British non-sports car whose popularity has seen the number of preserved examples increase.

The BBC Two documentary series &quot;Arena&quot; had a segment about the car and its enthusiasts, aired in January 1982, six months before the end of production, by which time Ford had confirmed that the Cortina name would be axed in favour of Sierra, which prompted a notable backlash from comedian Alexi Sayle. The episode ended with a Mk1 Cortina being ceremoniously cubed in a car crusher.

British punk rock band The Clash referenced the car in the song &quot;Janie Jones&quot;, singing &quot;He&#x27;s just like everyone, he&#x27;s got a Ford Cortina that just won&#x27;t run without fuel.&quot;

British indie band Arctic Monkeys put to music a poem &quot;I Wanna Be Yours&quot; by John Cooper Clarke in 2013, which contains the line &quot;I want to be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust.&quot;

Irish Rock band The Saw Doctors released a song called &quot;Red Cortina&quot; in 1991, in which they sing &quot;Your father used to drop you off, You&#x27;d step out of a Red Cortina.&quot;

English singer Elton John mentions a blue Ford Cortina in his song &quot;Made In England.&quot;

==Racing and rallying==

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Ford Cortina Lotus was a successful rally and racing car in a wide variety of competitions across Europe and North America. The standard Cortina was rarely used in competition of any sort, but benefited from the publicity generated by the Lotus versions.

At the end of their lives, however, many Cortinas did see action on oval racing circuits in the UK, as their rigidity and ready availability during the 1980s and 1990s made them a popular choice for banger racing. Although Cortinas are now relatively rare, they remain coveted by the banger racing fraternity and all-Cortina meetings are still occasional fixtures on the racing calendar.

Ian Geoghegan won the 1964 Australian Touring Car Championship driving a Ford Cortina GT.

==Other cars using Cortina engines==
The Kent engines used in the Cortina (popularly known as the &quot;Crossflow&quot;), being lightweight, reliable, and inexpensive, were popular with several low-volume sports-car manufacturers, including Morgan, which used them in the 1962–80 4/4 (and continued to use Ford engines in most of their models until 2020). The engines are also found in a number of British kit cars, and until recently, were the basis of Formula Ford racing, until replaced by &quot;Zetec&quot; engines.

The Kent engines were also used in several smaller Fords, most notably the Escort, lower end Capris and Fiesta.

The Pinto OHC engines used in the Mk.III onwards, as well as being fitted to contemporary Capris, Granadas, and Transits, were carried over to the Sierra for its first few years of production, before gradually being phased out by the newer CVH and DOHC units. Like the Kent Crossflow, they were also extensively used in kit cars; as a result, many Cortinas were scrapped solely for their engines, with the 2.0-litre Pintos being the most popular.

In recent years, the opposite phenomenon has become popular among enthusiasts, where classic Cortinas have been retrofitted with modern Ford engines – the most popular unit being the Zetec unit from the Mondeo and Focus. The Zetec, although originally intended only for front-wheel drive installation, can be adapted fairly easily owing to the engine&#x27;s use as a replacement for Kent units in Formula Ford.

==Sales and manufacture outside the United Kingdom==
The Cortina was also sold in other right-hand drive markets, such as Pakistan, Ireland (where it was assembled locally), Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand (local production 1961–76 as a joint venture with Anglo-Thai Motor Company, Ford&#x27;s import distributor), Malta, and South Africa. Mark III Cortina estates were adopted as police cars in Hong Kong. The Cortina was also assembled in left-hand drive in the Philippines, South Korea (by Hyundai as its first model), and Taiwan (by Ford Lio Ho) until the early 1980s.

The first two generations of the car were also sold through American Ford dealers in the 1960s. The Cortina competed fairly successfully there against most of the other small imports of its day, including GM&#x27;s Opel Kadett, the Renault Dauphine, and the just-appearing Toyotas and Datsuns, although none of them approached the phenomenal success of the Volkswagen Beetle. The Cortina was withdrawn from the US market when Ford decided to produce a domestic small car in 1971, the Ford Pinto, though it continued in Canada (with the Cortina Mark III) until the end of the 1973 model year. Subsequent European Ford products after the Cortina for the USA market (with the exception of the Fiesta Mk I &quot;circa&quot; 1978–80) were sold through Lincoln-Mercury dealerships (most notably the Ford Capri (MkI and II) and Ford Sierra – the latter of which was marketed in the USA under the Merkur marque).

The Cortina was also sold in some Continental European markets, such as Scandinavia, alongside the Taunus, as well as Portugal, being assembled in Ford&#x27;s factory in Amsterdam from the launch in 1962 until 1975. Production was for the Dutch market, but also for export to non-EC countries and even for export to the UK if the demand there was higher than the UK production capacity.

===Australia===
Ford Australia built a slightly adjusted Cortina at their Broadmeadows Assembly Plant alongside the Falcon, its derivatives and the Escort.

The Australian ’Corty’ was fairly similar to the British offerings until the release of the TC Cortina in 1970 when it gained its notability as an Australian icon after Ford of Australia decided to donate some components from its larger Falcon range. Additions included the 200 and 250 cubic inch inline 6 engines and a range of Australian BorgWarner transmissions. The TD facelift included a more refined interior and rectangular headlights, standard on the XL &amp; XLe. The TE and TF Cortina returned to following the British design almost to a T, however retaining the 200 and 250 6-cylinder engines, now with the revised Crossflow head. Throughout its life, the Cortina was also available in a range of colours from the Falcon lineup.

Many Aussie Cortinas have been modified as Street Machines, with the homemade ‘Redtop’ Barra Turbo engine being a common mill transplant, alongside the 302 Windsor, although being a Canadian design, with the Windsor being installed in hundreds of thousands of Falcons over the years, they are no rarity, Backed by GM T350, Ford C10, Top-loader and ZF6 being common boxes.

Available on the Australian (And South African, however very different) Cortina Mark III, was the XLe variant, the top specification, and a widely recognised nameplate in the country. The XLe Came with standard bucket seats, vinyl roof, 250c.i. Inline 6, 3 speed automatic BorgWarner transmission, full instrumentation, boot garnish and many more luxury style additions. The XLe was comparable to a combination of the British GXL and GT.

The Cortina ended production in 1981 and was succeeded by the Telstar.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Cortina range generally followed that of Britain. Overall complete knock-down assembly ran from 1962 to June 1983, at Ford&#x27;s Lower Hutt (Seaview) plant.

The Mark IV Cortina range, introduced into local assembly early in 1977, was very similar to that offered in the UK – a main specification difference, however, was the use of metric instrumentation, and that a two-door sedan was not offered. Engine sizes of 1.6 litres and 2.0 litres were available. The 2.0-litre was a very popular fleet vehicle and the transport of thousands of sales representatives in New Zealand over the years.

Additionally, limited imports were made of Australian Mark IV Cortinas, equipped with both 2.0-litre four-cylinder engines which featured more emissions control equipment than the UK-sourced cars, and the Falcon&#x27;s 4.1-litre six-cylinder engines.

The Mark V range was introduced early in 1980, a range that featured 1.6 base, 2.0 L, 2.0 GL, 2.0 Ghia, 2.3 V6 Ghia, and wagon variants for the 1.6 base and 2.0 L. The 2.0, unencumbered by emissions regulations, has at 5200 rpm. In 1982 the 2.0 GL model was discontinued and replaced with a 2.0 S (Sport) model, and unlike in the UK, it was a model in its own right. The &quot;S&quot; received a black, two-piece front spoiler and a rear spoiler. Two halogen extra lights were standard, as was a body-coloured grille. Most of the chrome trim was blacked out, while the steel wheels received a chrome band. A 2.0 commercial van was also introduced – essentially a Cortina estate without rear seats, aimed towards fleet buyers.

All 2.0-litre models had the option of automatic transmission, and with the 2.3-litre V6, it was the only transmission offered. The 2.3 also received power steering and additional sound-deadening material. A five-speed box was not available. A unique option, offered under guarantee by a dealership, South Auckland Ford, was a turbocharger.

The Ghia models were equipped similarly to UK models, but only the 2.3-litre V6 models featured imported Ford alloy wheels. Ford Rostyle steel rims were fitted to all 2.0 GL, Ghia, and S models, optionally on the other models. New Zealand Ghia models, however, did not feature a steel sliding sunroof (fitted as standard on UK Ghia models), although some models did feature an aftermarket sunroof.

The Cortina was a popular car in New Zealand, being the most sold car in seven years with over 100,000 assembled in total. It was missed by many when it ceased production in June 1983, notably after Ford New Zealand had scoured the globe for surplus assembly kits, a number of which came from Cork in Ireland. Station wagons (estate models) remained available until 1984. The Cortina range was finally replaced by the 1983 Ford Telstar range and the 1984 Ford Sierra station wagon. Sales had been dropping in the early 1980s, though, with the average age of buyers in 1981 being between 45 and 54. Quality and fitment were also issues of concern, with the local assembler welcoming the Cortina&#x27;s Mazda-built replacement.

Compared with Britain and many other countries where the Cortina was originally exported, in New Zealand, it has a far superior survival rate due to the climate being far drier and more favourable to the preservation of rust-free classic cars. Seeing examples in everyday use, especially New Zealand&#x27;s rural areas, is not uncommon, and obtaining spare parts to keep them on the roads has yet to become a significant problem. New Zealand has been a popular source of good-condition Cortinas to export back to the UK, where rust has condemned the majority.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Cortina range included V6 Essex-engined variants, in both 2.5-litre and 3.0-litre forms.

From July 1971, a locally designed pick-up truck version (known in Afrikaans as a &quot;bakkie&quot;) was also offered, and this remained in production even after the Cortina was replaced by the Sierra. The Mark V-based Cortina Pickup was exported to the UK, in a lengthened wheelbase form, as the Ford P100. This pick-up was launched in the UK in 1982, the year that the standard Cortina was being replaced by the Sierra. This version of the P100 was sold until 1988, when Ford divested from South Africa, and a Portuguese-built Sierra pick-up was introduced in its place, still using the P100 name.

The Mark V model range, introduced in 1980 for the South African market, included 1.3-litre L (1980–1982), 1.6-litre L, GL (1980–1983), 2.0-litre GL, Ghia, (1980–1984), 3.0-litre XR6 (1980–1983), 1.6-litre L Estate (1980–1983), 2.0-litre GL Estate (1980–1983), 3.0-litre GLS (1980–1984), 1.6-litre One-Tonner (1980–1985), and 3.0-litre One-Tonner (1980–1985).

The XR6 was a sports version that used the Essex V6 and featured body aerofoils and sport seats.

In 1981, a version called the XR6 Interceptor was released as a homologation special made to compete in production car racing. They featured triple Weber DCNF carburetors, aggressive camshaft, tubular exhaust manifold, suspension revisions, and wider Ronal 13-inch wheels. They produced 118 kW and were only available in red; 250 were produced.

Later on, a special-edition XR6 TF was released to celebrate &#x27;Team Fords&#x27; racing success with the XR6. They were essentially XR6s in exterior and interior Team Ford colours, which were blue and white.

In 1983, a special version was created by Simpson Ford to appease the demand for an Interceptor-like Cortina and was sold through Ford dealerships countrywide. It was called the XR6 X-ocet and featured a Holley carburettor, aggressive camshaft and tuned exhaust. They came in red with a white lower quarter and did 0– in 8.5 seconds with a top speed of .

South African Mark V models differed slightly from UK models with different wheels, bumpers, and interior trim.

The last brand new Cortina was sold in South Africa by mid-1984. It was often the country&#x27;s top-selling car, being far more popular than the Sierra, Telstar, and Mondeo models that followed it.

===South Korea===

The newly established Hyundai Motor Company began assembling the Mk2 Cortina under licence at its Ulsan plant in 1967. The later Hyundai Pony and Stellar, although not directly based on the Cortina/Taunus still used common componentry – most notably the rear suspension and axle which were interchangeable with the Ford car.

===Pakistan===
In the early 1960s, Cortinas were assembled by Ali Automobiles in Karachi.

<text>In mathematics education, Finite Mathematics is a syllabus in college and university mathematics that is independent of calculus. A course in precalculus may be a prerequisite for Finite Mathematics.

Contents of the course include an eclectic selection of topics often applied in social science and business, such as finite probability spaces, matrix multiplication, Markov processes, finite graphs, or mathematical models. These topics were used in Finite Mathematics courses at Dartmouth College as developed by John G. Kemeny, Gerald L. Thompson, and J. Laurie Snell and published by Prentice-Hall. Other publishers followed with their own topics. With the arrival of software to facilitate computations, teaching and usage shifted from a broad-spectrum Finite Mathematics with paper and pen, into development and usage of software.

<doc id="226985" wikidata="Q194358" url="?curid=226985" title="Vermiculite">
<text>Vermiculite is a hydrous phyllosilicate mineral which undergoes significant expansion when heated. Exfoliation occurs when the mineral is heated sufficiently; commercial furnaces can routinely produce this effect. Vermiculite forms by the weathering or hydrothermal alteration of biotite or phlogopite.
Large commercial vermiculite mines exist in the United States, Russia, South Africa, China, and Brazil.

==Occurrence==
Vermiculite was first described in 1824 for an occurrence in Millbury, Massachusetts. Its name is from the Latin , &quot;to breed worms&quot;, for the manner in which it exfoliates when heated.

It typically occurs as an alteration product at the contact between felsic and mafic or ultramafic rocks such as pyroxenites and dunites. It also occurs in carbonatites and metamorphosed magnesium-rich limestone. Associated mineral phases include: corundum, apatite, serpentine, and talc. It occurs interlayered with chlorite, biotite and phlogopite.

==Structure==
Vermiculite is a 2:1 clay, meaning it has two tetrahedral sheets for every one octahedral sheet. It is a limited-expansion clay with a medium shrink–swell capacity. Vermiculite has a high cation-exchange capacity (CEC) at 100–150 meq/100 g. Vermiculite clays are weathered micas in which the potassium ions between the molecular sheets are replaced by magnesium and iron ions.

==Commercial uses==

=== Molded shapes ===
This process involves mixing exfoliated vermiculite with inorganic bonding agents such as sodium silicate, cement (specific quantities), and other compounds, such as those containing potassium, to produce an &#x27;earth damp&#x27; mixture. This material is then hydraulically pressed into shape in a mold and then heat cured at temperatures up to 180 °C for up to 24 hours, depending upon the thickness of the moulded part. Such parts can withstand service temperatures of up to 1150 °C and are often used in the aluminium smelting industry as back-up insulation behind the carbon cathode in the pot cells which contain the molten mixture of cryolite and alumina. The moulded shapes and boards are used in:
* Open fireplaces
* High-temperature or refractory insulation
* Acoustic panels
*Fireproofing of structural steel and pipes

=== Calcium silicate boards ===
Exfoliated vermiculite is added to a calcium silicate slurry. This is then dewatered by pressing or by using one of the Fourdriner/Magnani/Hatschek processes to form a flat board which is then heat cured under pressure (typically 10–15 bar) for periods of up to 24 hours.

=== Brake linings ===
Finer grades of exfoliated vermiculite are being used in brake linings primarily for the automotive market. The properties of vermiculite that make it an appropriate choice for use in brake linings include its thermal resistance, ease of addition to other raw materials to achieve a homogeneous mix, and its shape and surface characteristics.

=== Roof and floor screeds and insulating concretes ===

Exfoliated vermiculite (typically the finer grades) can be added at site to Portland cement and other aggregates, rheological aids, and water to produce roof and floor concrete screeds (i.e. top layer screed coats) which are lightweight and insulating. In many cases, vermiculite-based roof screeds are used in conjunction with other insulation materials, such as polystyrene board, to form a total roofing system. A bituminous binder can also be used with exfoliated vermiculite to produce a dry, lightweight roof screed which has the advantages of low thermal conductivity, low moisture content, and ease of placement (by pouring from the bag and then tamping).

=== Soilless growing medium ===
Exfoliated vermiculite is combined with other materials such as peat or composted pine bark to produce soilless growing medium for the professional horticulturalist and for the home gardener. These mixes promote faster root growth and give quick anchorage to young roots. The mixture helps retain air, fertilizer, and moisture, releasing them as the plant requires them. These mixes were pioneered by Boodley and Sheldrake. Exfoliated vermiculite is also used as a growing medium for hydroponics.

=== Seed germination ===
Vermiculite, alone or mixed with soil or peat, is used to germinate seeds; very little watering is required. When vermiculite is used alone, seedlings should be fed with a weak fertilizer solution when the first true leaves appear, e.g. with one teaspoon of 5-10-5 soluble fertilizer per US gallon of water (1:768 ratio), gradually increased to one tablespoon (1:256 ratio) when transplanting.

=== Root crop storage ===
Pour vermiculite around bulbs placed in container. If clumps are dug, allow to dry for a few hours in the sun and then place in cartons or bushel baskets and cover with vermiculite. The absorptive power of vermiculite acts as a regulator that prevents mildew and moisture fluctuation during the storage period. It will not absorb moisture from the inside of stored tubers, but it does take up free water from the outside, preventing storage rot.

=== Soil conditioner ===
Where the native soil is heavy or sticky, gentle mixing of vermiculite as a soil conditioner—up to one-half the volume of the soil—is recommended. This creates air channels and allows the soil mix to breathe. Mixing vermiculite in flower and vegetable gardens or in potted plants will provide the necessary air to maintain vigorous plant growth. Where soils are sandy, mixing of vermiculite into the soil will allow the soil to hold the water and air needed for growth.

=== As loose-fill insulation ===
Exfoliated vermiculite treated with a water repellent is used to fill the pores and cavities of masonry construction and hollow blockwork to enhance fire ratings (e.g. Underwriters Laboratories Wall and Partition designs), thermal insulation, and acoustic performance. Expanded vermiculite has also been used as thermal insulation in the attics and walls of houses and in water heaters, fire safes, stoves, furnaces, and refrigerators.

=== Refractory/insulation gunning and castable mixes ===
Exfoliated vermiculite can be combined with high alumina (also known as calcium aluminate) cements and other aggregates such as expanded shale, clay, and slate or sodium silicate to produce refractory/insulation concretes and mortars. In the early days of their use, these products were batched at or very close to the place of installation. This continues to be the case in some limited circumstances; however, more and more use is being made of pre-batched, proprietary mixes. Mixes containing vermiculite are used in areas where strength and corrosion/abrasion resistance are of secondary importance, the most important factor being the insulation performance of the in-place refractory lining. These mixes are used in industries including iron/steel, cement, and hydrocarbon processing.

=== Fire protection ===
Vermiculite is used as an additive to fireproof wallboard.

=== High temperature coating ===
Vermiculite dispersions are typically either chemically or physically very finely delaminated vermiculite in a fluid medium. These dispersions can be used to make vermiculite &#x27;paper&#x27; sheets by pouring them onto a piece of smooth, low surface-energy plastic, and allowing to dry. The resulting sheet can then be peeled off the plastic. Typical end-uses for vermiculite dispersions include inclusion in high temperature coatings or binders for construction materials, gaskets, specialty papers/textiles, oxidation-resistant coating on carbon based composites, and as barrier coatings for films.

=== Waste treatment ===
The cation exchange capacity (up to 1,000 milliequivalents per kg) of vermiculite allows it to be used in fluid purification processes for waste water, chemical processing, and the pollution-control of air in mines and gases in industrial processes. In addition to its ion exchange properties, exfoliated vermiculite can retain liquids within the inter-laminar voids of the individual particles, as well as between the particles themselves.

=== Others ===
* As a packing material, valued for its high absorbency.
* As a cooling substrate in blacksmithing. 
* As a substrate for various animals and/or a medium for incubation of eggs.
* As a lightweight aggregate for plaster, proprietary concrete compounds, firestop mortar, and cementitious spray fireproofing: Exfoliated vermiculite is used in both hand and spray-applied general building plasters to improve coverage, ease of handling, adhesion to a wide variety of substrates, fire resistance, and resistance to chipping/cracking/shrinkage.
* As a component of the interior fill for firestop pillows, along with graphite.
* As a carrier for dry handling and slow release of agricultural chemicals.
* As a &quot;hot topping&quot;: both exfoliated and crude vermiculite have been used for &quot;hot topping&quot; in the steel industry. When poured onto molten metal, crude vermiculite exfoliates immediately and forms an insulating layer, allowing the material to be transported to the next production process without losing too much heat.
* Used to permit slow cooling of hot pieces in glassblowing, lampwork, steelwork, and glass beadmaking.
* Used in in-ground swimming pools to provide a smooth pool base: Finer grades of exfoliated vermiculite plus Portland cement may be combined either on-site or in a factory premix to provide a base for swimming pool vinyl liners. These mixes are pumped into place using a rotor stator pump, or hand poured.
* Used in commercial hand warmers.
* Used in AGA cookers as insulation.
* Used in explosives storage as a blast mitigant.
* Used to absorb hazardous liquids for solid disposal.
* Used in gas fireplaces to simulate embers.
* Used as part of a substrate for cultivation of fungi.

==Commercial manufacture of exfoliated vermiculite==

In 2014, South Africa, Brazil, the US, and China were the top producers of mined, concentrated and unexfoliated vermiculite, with about 90% world share. South Africa&#x27;s production is decreasing, while Brazil&#x27;s is significantly increasing.

While some end processors and exfoliators of vermiculite specialize, with proprietary products sold in a wide variety of industries, some have more varied end products, with less stringent technical requirements. Some vermiculite exfoliators blend with lower-cost perlite also. Vermiculite exfoliators have an international trade association called &quot;The Vermiculite Association&quot; to represent the industry&#x27;s interests and to exchange information.

==Asbestos contamination==
Although not all vermiculite contains asbestos, some products were made with vermiculite that contained asbestos until the early 1990s. Vermiculite mines throughout the world are now regularly tested for it and are supposed to sell products that contain no asbestos. The former vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana, did have tremolite asbestos as well as winchite and richterite (both fibrous amphiboles)—in fact, it was formed underground through essentially the same geologic processes as the contaminants.

Pure vermiculite does not contain asbestos and is non-toxic. Impure vermiculite may contain, apart from asbestos, also minor diopside or remnants of the precursor minerals biotite or phlogopite.

==Controversy over health risks==
The largest and oldest vermiculite mine in the United States was started in the 1920s, at Libby, Montana, and the vermiculite was sold under the commercial name Zonolite. The Zonolite brand and the mine were acquired by the W. R. Grace and Company in 1963. Mining operations at the Libby site stopped in 1990 in response to asbestos contamination. While in operation, the Libby mine may have produced 80% of the world&#x27;s supply of vermiculite.

The United States government estimates that vermiculite was used in more than 35 million homes, but does not recommend its removal. Nevertheless, homes or structures containing vermiculite or vermiculite insulation dating from before the mid-1990s—and especially those known to contain the &quot;Zonolite&quot; brand—may contain asbestos, and therefore may be a health concern.

An article published in &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; on December 3, 2006, reported that vermiculite and Zonolite had been found to contain asbestos, which had led to cancers such as those found in asbestos-related cases. The article stated that there had been a cover-up by W. R. Grace and Company and others regarding the health risks associated with vermiculite and that several sites in the Salt Lake Valley had been remediated by the EPA when they were shown to be contaminated with asbestos. W. R. Grace and Company has vigorously denied these charges.

The vermiculite deposit at the mine in Libby, Montana, was (and is) heavily contaminated with asbestos. Numerous people were knowingly exposed to the harmful dust of vermiculite that contained asbestos. Unfortunately, the mine had been operating since the 1920s, and environmental and industrial controls were virtually non-existent until the mine was purchased by the W. R. Grace and Company in 1963. Yet, knowing the human health risks, the mining company still continued to operate there until 1990. Consequently, many of the former miners and residents of Libby have been affected and continue to suffer health problems. Over 400 people in the town have died from asbestos-related disease due to contamination from vermiculite mining from nearby Zonolite Mountain, where soil samples were found to be loaded with fibrous tremolite (known to be a very hazardous form of asbestos), and countless others there who insulated their homes with Zonolite have succumbed to asbestos-related diseases, most of whom never were employed in environments where asbestos was an issue.

After a 1999 &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; story claimed that asbestos-related disease was common in the town, the EPA, in response to political pressure, made cleanup of the site a priority and called Libby the worst case of community-wide exposure to a toxic substance in U.S. history. The EPA has spent $120 million in Superfund money on cleanup. In October 2006, W. R. Grace and Company tried to appeal the fines ($54.5 million) levied on them from the EPA, but the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. The United States government pursued criminal charges against several former executives and managers of the mine for allegedly disregarding and covering up health risks to employees. They were also accused of wire fraud, and of obstructing the government&#x27;s cleanup efforts. As of the indictment date, about 1,200 residents of the Libby area had been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality. The case ended in acquittals on May 8, 2009. On June 17, 2009, the EPA issued a public health emergency in and near Libby, thereby allowing federal agencies to provide funding for health care, and for removal of contaminated insulation from affected homes.

<text>The United States Copyright Office (USCO), a part of the Library of Congress, is a United States government body that registers copyright claims, records information about copyright ownership, provides information to the public, and assists Congress and other parts of the government on a wide range of copyright issues. It maintains online records of copyright registration and recorded documents within the copyright catalog, which is used by copyright title researchers who are attempting to clear a chain of title for copyrighted works.

The Register of Copyrights heads the Copyright Office. Shira Perlmutter is the 14th and current Register, since October 26, 2020.

The Copyright Office is located in the James Madison Memorial Building of the Library of Congress, at 101 Independence Avenue SE, in Washington, DC. While open to the general public, appointments must be made to visit the Public Information Office and Copyright Public Records Reading Room.

==History==
The United States Constitution provides for establishing a system of extensive copyright laws in the United States. The first federal copyright law, the Copyright Act of 1790, was enacted on May 31, 1790, and covered only books, maps, and charts. Claims were originally recorded by Clerks of U.S. district courts. On June 9, 1790, the U.S. District Court of Pennsylvania registered the first work, the &quot;Philadelphia Spelling Book&quot; by John Barry.

In 1870, copyright functions were centralized in the Library of Congress under the direction of the then Librarian of Congress, Ainsworth Rand Spofford. Between 1870 and 1897, the Librarian of Congress also served as the head of the Copyright Office. The Copyright Office became a separate department of the Library of Congress on February 19, 1897, and Thorvald Solberg was appointed the first Register of Copyrights on July 22, 1897.

The 1909 Copyright Act was signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt on March 4, 1909, which expanded protection to additional types of works.

In the 1930s, the Copyright Office moved from its location in the Thomas Jefferson Building to new quarters in what is now the John Adams Building and in the 1970s it moved again, to its present quarters in the James Madison Memorial Building.

On October 19, 1976, President Gerald R. Ford signed into law the Copyright Act of 1976, which became effective on January 1, 1978. This law lengthened duration copyright protection and again expanded the types of works that covered under federal copyright protection, and with amendments made since then, is the current copyright law in effect.

== Functions ==
The mission of the Copyright Office is to promote creativity by administering and sustaining an effective national copyright system. While the purpose of the copyright system has always been to promote creativity in the society, the functions of the Copyright Office have grown to include the following:

=== Administering the Copyright Law ===
The Copyright Office examines all applications and deposits presented for registration of new and original and renewal of old copyright claims to determine their acceptability for registration under the provisions of the copyright law. The Office also records documents related to copyright ownership. However, the Copyright Act of 1976 made registration largely optional for copyright ownership. Under the 1976 Act, federal copyright requires only a fixation of an original work of authorship in a tangible medium of expression. Renewal is not compulsory, and a copyright owner can register at any time. The 1976 Act makes registration (or refusal of registration) a requisite for an infringement action.

The Copyright Office records the bibliographic descriptions and the copyright facts of all works registered. The archives maintained by the Copyright Office are an important record of America&#x27;s cultural and historical heritage. Containing nearly 45 million individual cards, the Copyright Card Catalog situated in the James Madison Memorial Building is an index to all the copyright registrations in the United States starting from 1870 up to 1977. Records after 1977 are maintained through an online database containing more than 16 million entries.

As a service unit of the Library of Congress, the Copyright Office is part of the legislative branch of the government, and provides copyright policy advice to the Congress. At the request of the Congress, the Copyright Office advises and assists the Congress in the development of national and international copyright policy; drafts legislation; and prepares technical studies on copyright-related matters.

The &quot;Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices&quot; manual documents the Copyright Office&#x27;s practices in its administration of copyright law.

A new fee schedule for Copyright Office services was made effective from March 20, 2020 onwards. Before that, the Copyright office&#x27;s fees were last updated in 2014. The revised fees increased only for certain registration and recording services, along with some associated services, while other services did not see a fee increase. In May 2014, the Office had reduced some renewal application and addendum fees in an effort to &quot;encourage the filing of more renewal claims&quot; and thereby help improve public records about copyright ownership. In 2020, the fees for a renewal application were increased while the addendum fee remains the same.

=== Providing Information Services to the Public ===

The Copyright Office provides public information and reference services concerning copyrights and recorded documents. The public can keep up on the developments in the Copyright Office by subscribing to the U.S. Copyright Office NewsNet, a free electronic mailing list that issues periodic email alerts to subscribers regarding hearings, deadlines for comments, new and proposed regulations, new publications, and other copyright-related subjects of interest.

===Acquiring Mandatory Deposits for the Library of Congress===
In 1870, Congress passed a law that centralized the copyright system in the Library of Congress. This law required all owners of copyrights of publicly distributed works to deposit in the Library two copies of every such work registered in the United States, whether it is a book, pamphlet, map, print, or piece of music. Supplying the information needs of the Congress, the Library of Congress has become the world&#x27;s largest library and the &quot;de facto&quot; national library of the United States. This repository of more than 162 million books, photographs, maps, films, documents, sound recordings, computer programs, and other items has grown largely through the operations of the copyright system, which brings deposits of every copyrighted work into the Library.

On August 29, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Copyright Office could no longer demand copies of published works under section 407 of the Copyright Act of 1976, which previously allowed the Office to demand 2 copies of any work published in the United States. It deemed this section unconstitutional under the &quot;takings clause&quot; of the Constitution. This did not affect the Office&#x27;s ability to collect deposit material through other sections of the copyright law, namely through the deposit requirement associated with copyright registration or through voluntary submission of copies through the Office.

=== Duties ===
The Copyright Office consults with interested copyright owners, industry and library representatives, bar associations, and other interested parties on issues related to the copyright law.

The Copyright Office promotes improved copyright protection for U.S. creative works abroad through its International Copyright Institute. Created within the Copyright Office by Congress in 1988, the International Copyright Institute provides training for high-level officials from developing and newly industrialized countries and encourages development of effective intellectual property laws and enforcement overseas.

The website has information about new copyright relevant legislation and a list of designated agents under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) and information about Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP) system of &quot;ad hoc&quot; copyright royalty arbitrators (now being phased out and replaced by the Copyright Royalty Board).

<text>A spoken language is a form of communication produced through articulate sounds or, in some cases, through manual gestures, as opposed to written language. Oral or vocal languages are those produced using the vocal tract, whereas sign languages are produced with the body and hands.

==Definition==
The term &quot;spoken language&quot; is sometimes used to mean only oral languages, especially by linguists, excluding sign languages and making the terms &#x27;spoken&#x27;, &#x27;oral&#x27;, &#x27;vocal language&#x27; synonymous. Others refer to sign language as &quot;spoken&quot;, especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs.

==Relation between spoken and written language==
The relationship between spoken language and written language is complex. Within the fields of linguistics, the current consensus is that speech is an innate human capability, and written language is a cultural invention. However, some linguists, such as those of the Prague school, argue that written and spoken language possess distinct qualities which would argue against written language being dependent on spoken language for its existence.

==Acquiring spoken language==
Hearing children acquire as their first language the language that is used around them, whether vocal, cued (if they are sighted), or signed. Deaf children can do the same with Cued Speech or sign language if either visual communication system is used around them. Vocal language are traditionally taught to them in the same way that written language must be taught to hearing children. (See oralism.) Teachers give particular emphasis on spoken language with children who speak a different primary language outside of the school. For the child it is considered important, socially and educationally, to have the opportunity to understand multiple languages.

<text>A written language is the representation of a language by means of writing. This involves the use of visual symbols, known as graphemes, to represent linguistic units such as phonemes, syllables, morphemes, or words. However, written language is not merely spoken or signed language written down, though it can approximate that. Instead, it is a separate system with its own norms, structures, and stylistic conventions, and it often evolves differently than its corresponding spoken or signed language.

Written languages serve as crucial tools for communication, enabling the recording, preservation, and transmission of information, ideas, and culture across time and space. The orthography of a written language comprises the norms by which it is expected to function, including rules regarding spelling and typography. A society&#x27;s use of written language generally has a profound impact on its social organization, cultural identity, and technological profile.

== Relationship with spoken and signed language ==

Writing, speech, and signing are three distinct modalities of language; each has unique characteristics and conventions. When discussing properties common to the modes of language, the individual speaking, signing, or writing will be referred to as the &quot;sender&quot;, and the individual listening, viewing, or reading as the &quot;receiver&quot;; senders and receivers together will be collectively termed &quot;agents&quot;. The spoken, signed, and written modes of language mutually influence one another, with the boundaries between conventions for each being fluid—particularly in informal written contexts like taking quick notes or posting on social media.

Spoken and signed language is typically more immediate, reflecting the local context of the conversation and the emotions of the agents, often via paralinguistic cues like body language. Utterances are typically less premeditated, and are more likely to feature informal vocabulary and shorter sentences. They are also primarily used in dialogue, and as such include elements that facilitate turn-taking; these including prosodic features such as trailing off and fillers that indicate the sender has not yet finished their turn. Errors encountered in spoken and signed language include disfluencies and hesitation.

By contrast, written language is typically more structured and formal. While speech and signing are transient, writing is permanent. It allows for planning, revision, and editing, which can lead to more complex sentences and a more extensive vocabulary. Written language also has to convey meaning without the aid of tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language, which often results in more explicit and detailed descriptions.

While a speaker can typically be identified by the quality of their voice, the author of a written text is often not obvious to a reader only analyzing the text itself. Writers may nevertheless indicate their identity via the graphical characteristics of their handwriting.

Written languages generally change more slowly than their spoken or signed counterparts. As a result, the written form of a language may retain archaic features or spellings that no longer reflect contemporary speech. Over time, this divergence may contribute to a dynamic of diglossia.

=== Grammar ===
There are too many grammatical differences to address, but here is a sample. In terms of clause types, written language is predominantly declarative (e.g. &quot;It&#x27;s red.&quot;) and typically contains fewer imperatives (e.g. &quot;Make it red.&quot;), interrogatives (e.g. &quot;Is it red?&quot;), and exclamatives (e.g. &quot;How red it is!&quot;) than spoken or signed language. Noun phrases are generally predominantly third person, but they are even more so in written language. Verb phrases in spoken English are more likely to be in simple aspect than in perfect or progressive aspect, and almost all of the past perfect verbs appear in written fiction.

=== Information packaging ===
Information packaging is the way that information is packaged within a sentence, that is the linear order in which information is presented. For example, &quot;On the hill, there was a tree&quot; has a different informational structure than &quot;There was a tree on the hill&quot;. While, in English, at least, the second structure is more common, the first example is relatively much more common in written language than in spoken language. Another example is that a construction like &quot;it was difficult to follow him&quot; is relatively more common in written language than in spoken language, compared to the alternative packaging &quot;to follow him was difficult&quot;. A final example, again from English, is that the passive voice is relatively more common in writing than in speaking.

=== Vocabulary ===
Written language typically has higher lexical density than spoken or signed language, meaning there is a wider range of vocabulary used and individual words are less likely to be repeated. It also includes fewer first and second-person pronouns and fewer interjections. Written English has fewer verbs and more nouns than spoken English, but even accounting for that, verbs like &quot;think&quot;, &quot;say&quot;, &quot;know&quot;, and &quot;guess&quot; appear relatively less commonly with a content clause complement (e.g. &quot;I think that it&#x27;s OK.&quot;) in written English than in spoken English.

== History ==

Writing developed independently in a handful of different locations, namely Mesopotamia and Egypt (), China (), and Mesoamerica (). Scholars mark the difference between prehistory and history with the invention of the first written language. The first writing can be dated back to the Neolithic era, with clay tablets being used to keep track of livestock and commodities. The first example of written language can be dated to Uruk, at the end of the 4th millennium BCE. An ancient Mesopotamian poem tells a tale about the invention of writing:
=== Origins ===

The origins of written language are tied to the development of human civilization. The earliest forms of writing were born out of the necessity to record commerce, historical events, and cultural traditions. The first known true writing systems were developed during the early Bronze Age (late 4th millennium BCE) in ancient Sumer, present-day southern Iraq. This system, known as cuneiform, was pictographic at first, but later evolved into an alphabet, a series of wedge-shaped signs used to represent language phonemically.

At roughly the same time, the system of Egyptian hieroglyphs was developing in the Nile valley, also evolving from pictographic proto-writing to include phonemic elements. The Indus Valley civilization developed a form of writing known as the Indus script , although its precise nature remains undeciphered. The Chinese script, one of the oldest continuously used writing systems in the world, originated around the late 2nd millennium BCE, evolving from oracle bone script used for divination purposes.

== Influence on society ==
The development and use of written language has had profound impacts on human societies, influencing everything from social organization and cultural identity to technology and the dissemination of knowledge. Plato (348 BCE), through the voice of Socrates, expressed concerns in the dialogue &quot;Phaedrus&quot; that a reliance on writing would weaken one&#x27;s ability to memorize and understand, as written words would &quot;create forgetfulness in the learners&#x27; souls, because they will not use their memories&quot;. He further argued that written words, being unable to answer questions or clarify themselves, are inferior to the living, interactive discourse of oral communication.

Written language facilitates the preservation and transmission of culture, history, and knowledge across time and space, allowing societies to develop complex systems of law, administration, and education. For example, the invention of writing in ancient Mesopotamia enabled the creation of detailed legal codes, like the Code of Hammurabi. The advent of digital technology has revolutionized written communication, leading to the emergence of new written genres and conventions, such as interactions via social media. This has implications for social relationships, education, and professional communication.

=== Literacy and social mobility ===
Literacy is the ability to read and write. From a graphemic perspective, this ability requires the capability of correctly recognizing or reproducing graphemes, the smallest units of written language. Literacy is a key driver of social mobility. Firstly, it underpins success in formal education, where the ability to comprehend textbooks, write essays, and interact with written instructional materials is fundamental. High literacy skills can lead to better academic performance, opening doors to higher education and specialized training opportunities.

In the job market, proficiency in written language is often a determinant of employment opportunities. Many professions require a high level of literacy, from drafting reports and proposals to interpreting technical manuals. The ability to effectively use written language can lead to higher paying jobs and upward career progression.

Literacy enables additional ways for individuals to participate in civic life, including understanding news articles and political debates to navigating legal documents. However, disparities in literacy rates and proficiency with written language can contribute to social inequalities. Socio-economic status, race, gender, and geographic location can all influence an individual&#x27;s access to quality literacy instruction. Addressing these disparities through inclusive and equitable education policies is crucial for promoting social mobility and reducing inequality.

=== Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s perspective ===
The Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan (1911–1980) primarily presented his ideas about written language in &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; (1962). Therein, McLuhan argued that the invention and spread of the printing press, and the shift from oral tradition to written culture that it spurred, fundamentally changed the nature of human society. This change, he suggested, led to the rise of individualism, nationalism, and other aspects of modernity.

McLuhan proposed that written language, especially as reproduced in large quantities by the printing press, contributed to a linear and sequential mode of thinking, as opposed to the more holistic and contextual thinking fostered by oral cultures. He associated this linear mode of thought with a shift towards more detached and objective forms of reasoning, which he saw as characteristic of the modern age. Furthermore, he theorized about the effects of different media on human consciousness and society. He famously asserted that &quot;the medium is the message&quot;, meaning that the form of a medium embeds itself in any message it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.

While McLuhan&#x27;s ideas are influential, they have also been critiqued and debated. Some scholars argue that he overemphasized the role of the medium (in this case, written language) at the expense of the content of communication. It has also been suggested that his theories are overly deterministic, not sufficiently accounting for the ways in which people can use and interpret media in varied ways.

=== Diglossia and digraphia ===

Diglossia is a sociolinguistic phenomenon where two distinct varieties of a languageoften one spoken and one writtenare used by a single language community in different social contexts.

The &quot;high variety&quot;, often the written language, is used in formal contexts, such as literature, formal education, or official communications. This variety tends to be more standardized and conservative, and may incorporate older or more formal vocabulary and grammar. The &quot;low variety&quot;, often the spoken language, is used in everyday conversation and informal contexts. It is typically more dynamic and innovative, and may incorporate regional dialects, slang, and other informal language features.

Diglossic situations are common in many parts of the world, including the Arab world, where the high Modern Standard Arabic variety coexists with other, low varieties of Arabic local to specific regions. Diglossia can have significant implications for language education, literacy, and sociolinguistic dynamics within a language community. 

Analogously, &quot;digraphia&quot; occurs when a language may be written in different scripts. For example, Serbian may be written using either the Cyrillic or Latin script, while Hindustani may be written in Devanagari or the Urdu alphabet.

== Orthography ==
Writing systems can be broadly classified into several types based on the units of language they correspond with: namely logographic, syllabic, and alphabetic. They are distinct from phonetic transcriptions with technical applications, which are not used as writing as such. For example, notation systems for signed languages like SignWriting been developed, but it is not universally agreed that these constitute a written form of the sign language in themselves.

Orthography comprises the rules and conventions for writing a given language, including how its graphemes are understood to correspond with speech. In some orthographies, there is a one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and graphemes, as in Serbian and Finnish. These are known as &quot;shallow orthographies&quot;. In contrast, orthographies like that of English and French are considered &quot;deep orthographies&quot; due to the complex relationships between sounds and symbols. For instance, in English, the phoneme can be represented by the graphemes as in , as in , or as in .

Orthographies also include rules about punctuation, capitalization, word breaks, and emphasis. They may also include specific conventions for representing foreign words and names, and for handling spelling changes to reflect changes in pronunciation or meaning over time.

<text>A copyright collective (also known as a copyright society, copyright collecting agency, licensing agency or copyright collecting society or collective management organization) is a non-governmental body created by copyright law or private agreement which licenses copyrighted works on behalf of the authors and engages in collective rights management. Copyright societies track all the events and venues where copyrighted works are used and ensure that the copyright holders listed with the society are remunerated for such usage. The copyright society publishes its own tariff scheme on its websites and collects a nominal administrative fee on every transaction.

Copyright societies evolved out of the need to have an organised body for licensing and managing copyrighted works. Without copyright societies, it would be impossible for users like restaurants, malls and large events to collect licenses from individual copyright holders and negotiate terms with them. Copyright societies negotiate prices and create tariffs on behalf of the authors that they represent and offset the imbalance of power between the users and the copyright holders. The lobbying power of copyright societies is especially important in industries like the music industry, where authors and owners of copyright are often placed at a disadvantage. The music streaming revolution was also projected as an attack on the power imbalance in the music industry. The evolution of technology and influence of music aggregators like Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora are changing the existing system of copyright licensing and might make copyright societies obsolete.

While the system of copyright societies is similar in all countries, their influence over the industry and mode of operation varies from country to country.

== Functions ==
Copyright societies operate by acquiring the right to license works from the owners and then negotiating and licensing the works to others. They usually operate in one particular industry and try to acquire the works of all the authors dealing in that particular industry. The tariffs decided by copyright societies are based on the kind of event or venue of the licensee and usually allow the licensee to access the entire repertoire of works available with the copyright society. The royalty distributed to the owners is based on their market influence and demand for their works. Reduction of transaction costs and other benefits of collective management can be realised only when the copyright society has control over all or most of the copyrighted works in a particular industry.

==In countries==
Copyright law is territorial in nature, but copyrights are protected in multiple countries through international instruments such as the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement. Along with licensing, copyright societies monitor the use of copyrighted works assigned to them and ensure that the copyright holders are fairly remunerated for such use. In order to monitor the use of copyrighted works abroad, societies enter into MoUs or international licensing agreements with their foreign counterparts in the industry and exchange information regarding the use of copyrighted materials.

Collecting societies can sell blanket licences, which grant the right to perform their catalogue for a period of time. Such a licence might for example provide a broadcaster with a single annual authorisation encompassing thousands of songs owned by thousands of composers, lyricists and publishers. The societies also sell individual licenses for users who reproduce and distribute music. For example, Apple must submit the download reports for the iTunes Store, which are used to determine their royalty payments.

This acquisition is guided by the country&#x27;s legal regime. Some jurisdictions, such as Hungary, create legal monopolies, and &quot;de facto&quot; monopolies arise in others. Once rights are acquired, the copyright collective then has to collect data on the uses of copyrighted works. The processing of this data will enable the copyright collective to discharge its functions, including the detection of unauthorized use, negotiation of licenses, collection of remuneration and distribution of collected remuneration amongst the members of the copyright collective on the basis of collected data.

===European Union===
Copyright collecting societies in the European Union usually hold monopolies in their respective national markets. Some countries create a statutory monopoly, while others recognise effective monopolies through regulations.

====Austria====
In Austria, the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers (&quot;&quot;, AKM) has a statutory monopoly.

====Germany====
German law recognizes GEMA as an effective monopoly, and the burden of proof is on an accused infringer that a work is not managed by GEMA. GEMA has one of the most effective and lucrative music copyright administration systems.

====Hungary====
Hungary operates a legal monopoly.

====Italy====
SIAE () is the Italian copyright collecting agency. Founded in 1882 in the Kingdom of Italy, it is the monopolist intermediary between the authors of musical tracks and consumers, managing the economic aspects and the distribution of money from royalties of Italian-copyrighted music to authors and on their behalf.

====The Netherlands====
BUMA/STEMRA are two private organisations in the Netherlands, the Buma Association (Dutch: &quot;Vereniging Buma&quot;) and the Stemra Foundation (Dutch: &quot;Stichting Stemra&quot;) that operate as one single company that acts as the Dutch collecting society for composers and music publishers.

=== India ===
Copyright Societies in India have to register themselves under section 33 of the Copyright Act of 1957. In order to do the business of issuing or granting license in respect of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works incorporated in a cinematograph films or sound recordings it is necessary that the organization be registered as a copyright society under Section 33. The proviso to section 33 sub clause 3 states &quot;‘Provided that the Central Government shall not ordinarily register more than one copyright society to do business in respect of the same class of works’.&quot; This effectively creates a monopoly and mandates that only one copyright society can exist in a particular industry. This ensures concentration of bargaining power and equal terms of royalty in an industry.

Copyright societies have to renew their registration under section 33 every five years and its registration can be cancelled at any time if the central government feels like it is being managed in a manner detrimental to the interests of the authors and other owners of the copyright. The major copyright societies in India are The Indian Performing Right Society Limited [IPRS] (for composers and publishers), Indian Reprographic Right Organisation [IRRO] (for literary organisations) and Indian Singers Rights Association [ISRA] (for performers). Phonographic Performance Limited [PPL] (for producers) was previously registered as a copyright society under S.33 of the Copyright Act but now mentions on its website that it licenses and transfers copyrights under S.18 and S.30 and functions as a company registered under the Companies Act 2013. PPL represents producers and record companies and is a major licensor of music to events and establishments. The ISRA and IPRS are registered copyright societies under S. 33 of the Copyright Act 1957. ISRA represents the interests of singers and aims to protect performer&#x27;s rights as enshrined in S.38 and S.38A of the Copyrights Act 1957. IPRS represents composers, lyricists and publishers of music in India and is a registered copyright society under S.33 of the Copyright Act 1957.

The Screenwriters Association of India [SRAI] earlier known as Film Writers Association represents the interests of lyricists, screenwriters and novelists. It applied for becoming a copyright society in 2017 but is currently operating as a trade union representing its members. Recently an application for registration under S.33 was made by the Recorded Music Performance ltd which controls public performance and broadcasting rights of sound recordings of its member companies. RMPL has applied for registration as PPL is no longer operating as a copyright society under S.33 of the Copyrights Act 1957. The validity of PPL operating as a company has been debated and was considered by the 2014 case of &quot;Leopold cafe v. Novex Communication&quot; in which the Bombay High Court that s.30 of the Copyright Act 1957 allows a duly authorised agent to issue licenses on behalf of authors and other owners, therefore organisations can perform the activities of a copyright society without being registered under S.33 but it will not be referred to as a copyright society and cannot issue licenses in its own name. PPL now operates as a Copyrights Organisation [CRO] and can only issue licenses as an agent, therefore it must issue licenses in the name of the copyright owners and not itself.

===United Kingdom===
See Copyright Licensing Agency, Phonographic Performance Limited, and PRS for Music.

=== United States and Canada ===
In the U.S. and Canada, groups that provide intermediary functions between copyright holders and performers of works such as music are called performance rights organisations or PROs. Other organizations such as artists&#x27; rights groups license and collect royalties for the reproduction of works such as paintings by living or recently deceased artists whose work has not yet entered the public domain. There are also collectives that collect royalties for copies from magazines and scholarly journals such as Access Copyright in Canada.

In the US, PROs ensure that rights holders are paid their share of public performance royalties, by issuing licenses to different companies and establishments and tracking where and how often the songs of their affiliates are performed at these public venues. An author can only be part of one PRO, as the five existing PROs in the US have distinct systems for tariffs and payment of royalty as they compete with each other in the market. The five major PROs in the music industry in the US are ASCAP, SESAC, BMI, 
AllTrack, and SoundExchange. In the US copyright collectives are registered companies that act as agents of the owners of the copyright. The websites of the PROs have their Memorandum of association and Articles of association and their tariff policies.

The validity of PROs was challenged in the 1979 anti-trust suit of &quot;Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc.&quot; in which CBS BMI and said that the tariffs decided by BMI were for blanket licenses and therefore amounted to price fixing. The court held in this case that the actions of PROs were not anti competitive as there was no bar on obtaining licenses from individual copyright holders.

Digitisation and internet based music streaming services have majorly changed the music industry and the US copyright law has changed majorly to accommodate such innovation. Music Modernization Act (MMA) was signed by President Donald Trump on 11 October 2018 as the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act of 2018. The MMA streamlines the music licensing process in order to make it easier for copyright holders to get paid when their music is streamed online through services like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music. Songwriters and artists will receive royalties on songs recorded before 1972 and this will ensure that songwriters are paid by streaming services with a single mechanical licensing database overseen by music publishers and songwriters. The cost of creating and maintaining this database will be paid for by digital streaming services and the database and tariff will be determined by an authority created under the MMA. The mechanism provided under the act will determine unclaimed royalties due to music professionals and provide a consistent legal process to receive them. Previously, these unclaimed royalties were held by digital service providers like Spotify to the detriment of the authors. All of this will also ensure that artists are paid more and have a fair mechanism to approach for getting the money they are owed. This changes the scheme of S.115 of the US which governs compulsory licensing and allows the authority created under the act to issue blanket licenses for music to streaming services. While this does take away some agency of artists, there has been overwhelming support for this legislation from the music industry as it will ensure that licensing and royalty payments are transferred on a fair basis.

The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers [ASCAP] has direct or indirect connections with copyright societies in over 30 countries. Once it receives information regarding unauthorised use of copyrighted works, the affiliated foreign copyright society collects the royalty on behalf of the copyright society representing the owner, and forwards payments to it.

<text>Moldovan or Moldavian (Latin alphabet: , Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet: ) is one of the two local names for the Romanian language in Moldova. &quot;Moldovan&quot; was declared the official language of Moldova in Article 13 of the constitution adopted in 1994, while the 1991 Declaration of Independence of Moldova used the name &quot;Romanian&quot;. In 2003, the Moldovan parliament adopted a law defining &quot;Moldovan&quot; and &quot;Romanian&quot; as glottonyms for the same language. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence, thus giving official status to the name &quot;Romanian&quot;. The breakaway region of Transnistria continues to recognize &quot;Moldavian&quot; as one of its official languages, alongside Russian and Ukrainian. Ukraine also continued until recently to make a distinction between &quot;Moldovan&quot; and &quot;Romanian&quot;, with one village declaring its language to be &quot;Romanian&quot; and another declaring it to be &quot;Moldovan&quot;, though Ukrainian officials have announced an intention to remove the legal status of &quot;Moldovan&quot;. On 16 November 2023, the Ministry of Education and Science of the Ukrainian government stated that it has initiated steps to abolish the Moldovan language and to replace it with Romanian. On 13 January 2024, Ukrainian newspaper &quot;Dumska&quot; reported that the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science had announced all 16 schools in Odesa Oblast teaching &quot;Moldovan&quot; had dropped the term in favor of Romanian. On 16 March 2023, the Moldovan Parliament approved a law on referring to the national language as &quot;Romanian&quot; in all legislative texts and the constitution. On 22 March, the president of Moldova, Maia Sandu, promulgated the law.

The language of the Moldovans had for centuries been interchangeably identified by both terms, but during the time of the Soviet Union, &quot;Moldovan&quot;, or as it was called at the time, &quot;Moldavian&quot;, was the only term officially recognized. Its resolution declared Moldavian a Romance language distinct from Romanian.

While a majority of Moldovans with higher education, as well as a majority of inhabitants of the capital city of Chișinău, call their language &quot;Romanian&quot;, most rural residents indicated &quot;Moldovan&quot; as their native language in the 2004 census. In schools in Moldova, the term &quot;Romanian language&quot; has been used since independence.

The variety of Romanian spoken in Moldova is the Moldavian subdialect, which is spread approximately within the territory of the former Principality of Moldavia (now split between Romania, Moldova and Ukraine). Moldavian is considered one of the five major spoken varieties of Romanian. However, all five are written identically, and Moldova and Romania share the same literary language.

The standard alphabet used in Moldova is equivalent to the Romanian alphabet, which uses the Latin script. Until 1918, varieties of the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet were used. The Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet (derived from the Russian alphabet and standardised in the Soviet Union) was used in 1924–1932 and 1938–1989 and remains in use in Transnistria.

== History and politics ==
=== Birth ===

The history of the Moldovan language refers to the historical evolution of the glottonym &quot;Moldavian&quot;/&quot;Moldovan&quot; in Moldova and beyond. It is closely tied to the region&#x27;s political status, as during long periods of rule by Russia and the Soviet Union, officials emphasized the language&#x27;s name as part of separating the Moldovans from those people who began to identify as Romanian in a different nation-building process. Cyrillic script was in use. From a linguistic perspective, &quot;Moldovan&quot; is an alternative name for the varieties of the Romanian language spoken in the Republic of Moldova (see History of the Romanian language).

Before 1918, during the period between the wars, and after the union of Bessarabia with Romania, scholars did not have consensus that Moldovans and the Romanians formed a single ethnic group. The Moldovan peasants had grown up in a different political entity and missed the years of creating a pan-Romanian national political consciousness. They identified as Moldovans speaking the language &quot;Moldovan&quot;. This caused reactions from pan-Romanian nationalists. The concept of the distinction of Moldovan from Romanian was explicitly stated only in the early 20th century. It accompanied the raising of national awareness among Moldovans, with the Soviets emphasizing distinctions between Moldavians and Romanians. &quot;Moldavian&quot; has also been recorded by the 1960s&#x27; &quot;Romanian Linguistic Atlas&quot; as the answer to the question &quot;What [language] do you speak?&quot; in parts of Western Moldavia (Galați and Iași counties).

Major developments since the fall of the Soviet Union include resuming use of a Latin script rather than Cyrillic letters in 1989, and several changes in the statutory name of the official language used in Moldova. At one point of particular confusion about identity in the 1990s, all references to geography in the name of the language were dropped, and it was officially known simply as &quot;&quot; — &#x27;the state language&#x27;.

Moldovan was assigned the code codice_1 in ISO 639-1 and code codice_2 in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3. Since November 2008, these have been deprecated, leaving codice_3 and codice_4 (639-2/T) and codice_5 (639-2/B), the language identifiers to be used for the variant of the Romanian language also known as Moldavian and Moldovan in English, the ISO 639-2 Registration Authority said in explaining the decision.

In 1989, the contemporary Romanian version of the Latin alphabet was adopted as the official script of the Moldavian SSR.

=== Independent Moldova ===

The Declaration of Independence of Moldova (27 August 1991) named the official language as &quot;Romanian&quot;. The 1994 constitution, passed under a Communist government, declared &quot;Moldovan&quot; as the state language.

When in 1993 the Romanian Academy changed the official orthography of the Romanian language, the Institute of Linguistics at the Academy of Sciences of Moldova did not initially make these changes, which however have since been adopted.

In 1996, the Moldovan president Mircea Snegur attempted to change the official name of the language back to &quot;Romanian&quot;; the Moldovan Parliament, dominated by the Democratic Agrarian Party and various far left forces, dismissed the proposal as promoting &quot;Romanian expansionism&quot;.

In 2003, a Moldovan–Romanian dictionary ( (2003)) by Vasile Stati was published aiming to prove that there existed two distinct languages. Reacting to this, linguists of the Romanian Academy in Romania declared that all the Moldovan words are also Romanian words, although some of its contents are disputed as being Russian loanwords. In Moldova, the head of the Academy of Sciences&#x27; Institute of Linguistics, Ion Bărbuță, described the dictionary as &quot;an absurdity, serving political purposes&quot;. Stati, however, accused both of promoting &quot;Romanian colonialism&quot;. At that point, a group of Romanian linguists adopted a resolution stating that promotion of the notion of a distinct Moldovan language is an anti-scientific campaign.

In 2003, the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova adopted a law defining &quot;Moldovan&quot; and &quot;Romanian&quot; as designations for the same language (glottonyms). 

In the 2004 census, 16.5% (558,508) of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova declared Romanian as their native language, whereas 60% declared Moldovan. Most of the latter responses were from rural populations. While the majority of the population in the capital city of Chișinău gave their language as &quot;Romanian&quot;, in the countryside more than six-sevenths of the Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated &quot;Moldovan&quot; as their native language, reflecting historic conservatism. Currently, 2,184,065 people or 80.2% of those covered by the 2014 census on the right bank of the Dniester or Moldova (proper, without the Transnistrian separatist region) identified Moldovan or Romanian as their native language, of which 1,544,726 (55.1%) declared Moldovan and 639.339 (22.8%) declared it Romanian. According to the 2014 census, 2,720,377 answered to the question on &quot;language usually used for communication&quot;. 2,138,964 people or 78.63% of the inhabitants of Moldova (proper, without the Transnistrian separatist region) have Moldovan/Romanian as first language, of which 1,486,570 (53%) declared it Moldovan and 652,394 (23.3%) declared it Romanian.

In the Republic of Moldova, “more than half of the self-proclaimed Moldovans (53.5%) said that they saw no difference” between the Romanian and Moldovan languages according to a survey conducted by Pal Kolsto and Hans Olav Melberg in 1998. Opinion polling from the Chernivtsi oblast indicated that a significant majority of the self-identified Moldovans thought that there was no difference between the Moldovan language and the Romanian language in that part of Ukraine. According to Alla Skvortsova, an ethnic Russian researcher from the Republic of Moldova, &quot;Our survey found that while 94.4 percent of the Romanians living in Moldova consider Moldovan and Romanian to be the same language, only half of the Moldovans (53.2 percent) share this view&quot;.

In schools in Moldova, the term &quot;Romanian language&quot; has been used since independence.

In December 2007, Moldovan president Vladimir Voronin asked for the term to be changed to &quot;Moldovan language&quot;, but due to public pressure against that choice, the term was not changed.

In December 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova ruled that the Declaration of Independence takes precedence over the Constitution and that the state language should be called Romanian.

By March 2017, the presidential website under Igor Dodon had changed the Romanian language option to &quot;Moldovan&quot;, which was described to be &quot;in accordance with the constitution&quot; by said president. The change was reverted on 24 December 2020, the day Maia Sandu assumed office.

In June 2021, during a meeting between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania Bogdan Aurescu and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba, the former asked Ukraine to recognize the nonexistence of the Moldovan language to improve the situation of the Romanians in Ukraine. Kuleba responded to this saying that they were trying to do the paperwork for this as soon as possible. On 30 November 2022, during another meeting between Aurescu and Kuleba, Aurescu reiterated this request. This happened again during a phone call between the two ministers on 12 April 2023, after Moldova had legally changed its official language to Romanian.

=== Discontinuation in Moldova and Ukraine ===
On 2 March 2023, the Moldovan parliament voted to replace the phrases &quot;Moldovan language&quot;, &quot;state language&quot; and &quot;official language&quot; in Moldovan legislation with the phrase &quot;Romanian language&quot;. The change was presented not as a constitutional change, but only a technical one, as it would implement the 2013 decision of the Constitutional Court of Moldova. This change was supported by the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity and was strongly opposed by the Bloc of Communists and Socialists. The Academy of Sciences of Moldova also supported this decision. The bill was approved on its second and final reading on 16 March. This attracted criticism from Russia. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, claimed that &quot;the Romanian language should be renamed to Moldovan, and not the opposite&quot;. Romanian foreign minister Aurescu replied to this by saying, &quot;This so-called Moldovan language does not exist, it is an artificial construct, which was created by the Soviet Union and has later been used by Russia for disinformation purposes&quot;. To this, Zakharova replied back by saying, &quot;Sr. Bogdan Aurescu never existed either, but in the end he was created. Now it is possible to call him an artificial construct.&quot; The president of Moldova, Maia Sandu, promulgated the law on 22 March. It was published on the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Official Bulletin of the Republic of Moldova&quot;), a state publication where all promulgated laws are published, on 24 March, thus entering into force. On 30 March, the changes appeared on the Constitution of Moldova.

On 13 April, Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu requested the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to relinquish the recognition of the Moldovan language in Ukraine. However, as of June 2023, Ukraine still continues to make Moldovan-language schoolbooks.

On 18 August, Prime Minister of Romania Marcel Ciolacu and Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal had a meeting in Bucharest. Among the things that were discussed was the issue of the Romanian minority in Ukraine. Ciolacu said that Romania sought for the Romanians in Ukraine to have exactly the same rights as the Ukrainians in Romania and also for the removal of the Moldovan language from Ukrainian legislation.

Starting from 1 September 2023, the high school in the village of Borysivka () in Odesa Oblast, where Ukrainian Romanians study, replaced the term &quot;Moldovan language&quot; with &quot;Romanian language&quot; in its curriculum.

On 10 October, during a meeting between Ciolacu and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ciolacu once again requested that the Ukrainian authorities stop recognizing the existence of the Moldovan language. On the same day, during a meeting with Romanian journalists, Zelenskyy was asked if Ukraine would stop recognising the Moldovan language. He responded by saying that he did not see this as a global problem and that it was not an urgent issue for a country at war but that the Ukrainian government would meet in a week or two and that a solution to the issue &quot;I&#x27;m sure everyone will be happy&quot; with would be found.

On 18 October, Ukrainian authorities promised to &quot;resolve the issue of artificial separation between the Romanian and &quot;Moldovan&quot; languages by implementing appropriate practical measures with due consideration of all legal aspects.&quot; Former Moldovan president Igor Dodon, as well as the Revival Party, have criticised this decision. According to an expert on Ukrainian affairs interviewed by the Romanian newspaper &quot;Libertatea&quot;, &quot;Marcel Ciolacu&#x27;s visit to Ukraine marked the end of a diplomatic effort by the Republic of Moldova and Romania in the face of Kyiv but, at the same time, it marks only the beginning of a difficult, lasting process within the Ukrainian state.&quot; Thus, the Moldovan language would not have been derecognised by Ukraine on 18 October, this was only in process.

On 16 November, the Ministry of Education and Science of the Ukrainian government stated that it has initiated steps to abolish the Moldovan language and to replace it with Romanian. The Ukrainian Ministry of Education stated: 

On 13 January 2024, Ukrainian newspaper &quot;Dumska&quot; reported that the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science had announced all 16 schools in Odesa Oblast teaching &quot;Moldovan&quot; had dropped the term in favor of Romanian. However, Anatol Popescu, president of the Bessarabia National–Cultural Association, reported that in the Romanian school of (), the term had been replaced with &quot;language of the national minority&quot; instead, protesting against this and against other issues that had been reported regarding the school&#x27;s intended renaming and reorganization into a high school.

On 24 December, the Ukrainian Government approved a bill that would propose replacing &quot;Moldovan&quot; with Romanian on Ukraine&#x27;s new proposed international list in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which would exclude it from the protected languages in Ukraine. The bill would also exclude the Belarusian and Russian languages. The bill requires examination and approval by the Verkhovna Rada to enter into force.

== Controversy ==


The matter of whether or not Moldovan is a separate language continues to be contested politically within and beyond the Republic of Moldova. The 1989 Language Law of the Moldavian SSR, which is still in effect in Moldova, according to the Constitution, asserts a &quot;linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity&quot;. Article 13 of the Moldovan Constitution used to name it &quot;the national language of the country&quot; (the original uses the phrase , which literally means &#x27;the language of the state&#x27;) until 2023. In March 2023 the Parliament of Moldova has approved a law on referring to the national language as Romanian in all legislative texts and the constitution following the 2013 decision of the Constitutional Court of Moldova that gives primacy to the text of the 1991 Declaration of Independence of Moldova that calls the national language Romanian. The law was approved by the parliament on 16 March, and the President of Moldova promulgated the law on 22 March.

In the breakaway region of Transnistria, Moldovan is declared an official language, together with Ukrainian and Russian.

Standard Moldovan is widely considered to be identical to standard Romanian. Writing about &quot;essential differences&quot;, Vasile Stati, supporter of Moldovenism, is obliged to concentrate almost exclusively on lexical rather than grammatical differences. Whatever language distinctions may once have existed, these have been decreasing rather than increasing. King wrote in 2000 that &quot;in the main, Moldovan in its standard form was more Romanian by the 1980s than at any point in its history&quot;.

In 2002, the Moldovan Minister of Justice Ion Morei said that Romanian and Moldovan were the same language and that the Constitution of Moldova should be amended to reflect this—not by substituting &quot;Romanian&quot; for the word &quot;Moldovan&quot;, but by adding that &quot;Romanian and Moldovan are the same language&quot;. The education minister Valentin Beniuc said: &quot;I have stated more than once that the notion of a Moldovan language and a Romanian language reflects the same linguistic phenomenon in essence.&quot; The president of Moldova Vladimir Voronin acknowledged that the two languages are identical, but said that Moldovans should have the right to call their language &quot;Moldovan&quot;.

In the 2004 census, of the citizens living in Moldova, 60% identified Moldovan as their native language; 16.5% chose Romanian. While 37% of all urban Romanian/Moldovan speakers identified Romanian as their native language, in the countryside 86% of the Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Moldovan, a historic holdover. Independent studies found a Moldovan linguistic identity asserted in particular by the rural population and post-Soviet political class. In a survey conducted in four villages near the border with Romania, when asked about their native language the interviewees identified the following: Moldovan 53%, Romanian 44%, and Russian 3%.

In November 2007, when reporting on EU Council deliberations regarding an agreement between the European Community and Moldova, the Romanian reporter Jean Marin Marinescu included a recommendation to avoid formal references to the &quot;Moldovan language&quot;. The Romanian press speculated that the EU banned the usage of the phrase &quot;Moldovan language&quot;. However, the European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, denied these allegations. She said that the Moldovan language is referred to in the 1998 Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Moldova, and hence it is considered a part of the acquis, binding on all member states.

== Orthography ==

The language was generally written in a Romanian Cyrillic alphabet (based on the Old Church Slavonic alphabet) before the 19th century. Both Cyrillic and, rarely, Latin, were used until after World War I; after Bessarabia was included in Romania in 1918, the Cyrillic alphabet was officially forbidden in the region. In the interwar period, Soviet authorities in the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic alternately used Latin or Cyrillic for writing the language, mirroring the political goals of the moment. Between 1940 and 1989, i.e., during Soviet rule, the new Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet replaced Latin as the official alphabet in Moldova (then Moldavian SSR). In 1989, the Latin script was once again adopted in Moldova by Law 3462 of 31 August 1989, which provided rules for transliterating Cyrillic to Latin, along with the orthographic rules used in Romania at the time. Transnistria, however, uses the Cyrillic alphabet.

Though not immediately adopting these, the Academy of Sciences of Moldova acknowledged both the Romanian Academy&#x27;s decision of 1993 and the orthographic reform of 2005. In 2000, the Moldovan Academy recommended adopting the spelling rules used in Romania, and in 2010 launched a schedule for the transition to the new rules that was completed in 2011 (regarding its publications). However, these changes were not implemented by Moldova&#x27;s Ministry of Education, so the old orthographic conventions were maintained in the education sector such as in school textbooks.

On 17 October 2016, Minister of Education Corina Fusu signed Order No. 872 on the application of the revised spelling rules as adopted by the Moldovan Academy of Sciences, coming into force on the day of signing. Since then the spelling used by institutions subordinated to the Ministry of Education is in line with the spelling norms used in Romania since 1993. This order, however, has no application to other government institutions, nor has Law 3462 been amended to reflect these changes; thus, those institutions continue to use the old spelling.

<text>Leidos Holdings, Inc. is an American defense, aviation, information technology, and biomedical research company headquartered in Reston, Virginia, that provides scientific, engineering, systems integration, and technical services. Founded as Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Leidos merged with Lockheed Martin&#x27;s IT sector, Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions (Lockheed Martin IS&amp;GS), in August 2016 to create the defense industry’s largest IT services provider. The Leidos-Lockheed Martin merger is one of the biggest transactions thus far in the consolidation of the defense sector. Leidos contracts extensively with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Intelligence Community, as well as other U.S. government agencies and select commercial markets.

==History==
===As SAIC===

The company was founded by J. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Beyster in 1969 in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI). Beyster, a former scientist for the Westinghouse Atomic Power Division and Los Alamos National Laboratory, who became the chairman of the Accelerator Physics Department of General Atomics in 1957, raised the money to start SAI by selling stock he had received from General Atomics, combined with funds raised from the early employees who bought stock in the young enterprise.

Initially, the company&#x27;s focus was on projects for the U.S. government related to nuclear power and weapons effects study programs. The company was renamed Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as it expanded its operations. Major projects during Beyster&#x27;s tenure included work on radiation therapy for the Los Alamos National Laboratory; technical support and management assistance to the development of the cruise missile in the 1970s; the cleanups of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station after its major accident, and of the contaminated community of Love Canal; design and performance evaluation of the Stars &amp; Stripes 87, the winning ship for the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup; and the design of the first luggage inspection machine to pass new Federal Aviation Administration tests following the terrorist bombing of Pan American flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.

Contrary to traditional business models, Beyster originally designed SAIC as an employee-owned company. This shared ownership was accompanied by shared responsibility and freedom in business development, and allowed SAIC to attract and retain highly educated and motivated employees that helped the company to grow and diversify. After Beyster&#x27;s retirement in 2003, SAIC conducted an initial public offering of common stock on October 17, 2006. The offering of 86,250,000 shares of common stock was priced at $15.00 per share. The underwriters, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley, exercised overallotment options, resulting in 11.25 million shares. The IPO raised US$1.245 billion. Even then, employee shares retained a privileged status, having ten times the voting power per share over common stock.

In September 2009 SAIC relocated its corporate headquarters to their existing facilities in Tysons Corner in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near McLean.

In 2012 SAIC was ordered to pay $550 million to the City of New York for overbilling over a period of seven years on the CityTime contract. In 2014 Gerard Denault, SAIC&#x27;s CityTime program manager, and his two accomplices within the city&#x27;s government were sentenced to twenty years in prison for fraud and bribery related to that contract.

===As Leidos===

In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies. The company spun off about a third of its business, forming an approximately $4 billion-per-year service company focused on government services, including systems engineering, technical assistance, financial analysis, and program office support. The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC&#x27;s &quot;Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance&quot; group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper. The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company which would have resulted in conflicts of interest. In February 2013, it was announced that the smaller spin-off company would get the name &quot;Science Applications International Corporation&quot; and stay in the current headquarters, while the larger company would change its name to &quot;Leidos&quot;, (created by clipping the word &quot;kaleidoscope&quot;) and would move its headquarters to Reston, Virginia. The split was structured in a way that SAIC changed its name to Leidos, then spun off the new SAIC as a separate publicly traded company. However, Leidos is the legal successor of the original SAIC and retains SAIC&#x27;s pre-2013 stock price and corporate filing history.

Before the split, Leidos employed 39,600 employees and reported $11.17 billion in revenue and $525 million net income for its fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, making it number 240 on the Fortune 500 list. In 2014, Leidos reported US$5.06 billion in revenue.

In August 2016, the deal to merge with the entirety of Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions (IS&amp;GS) business came to a close, more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry&#x27;s largest enterprise in the federal technology sector. 

In January 2020, Leidos purchased defense contractor Dynetics for approximately $1.65 billion. In May 2020 it purchased the Security Detection and Automation Systems division of L3Harris (notable for providing the detection screeners that all airport travelers pass through when flying).

As of December 2023, the company has 47,000 employees. In 2023, Leidos reported US$15.4 billion in revenue. It ranked 266 on the 2024 Fortune 500 list.

==Structure==

Leidos has four central divisions: Civil, Health, Advanced Solutions, and Defense &amp; Intelligence. The Civil Division focuses on integrating aviation systems, securing transportation measures, modernizing IT infrastructure, and engineering energy efficiently. The Health Division focuses on optimizing medical enterprises, securing private medical data, and improving collection and data entry methods. The Advanced Solutions Division is centered around data analysis, integrating advanced defense and intelligence systems, and increasing surveillance and reconnaissance efficiency. The Defense &amp; Intelligence Division focuses on providing air service systems, geospatial analysis, cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and supporting operations efforts.

==Management==

Retired Air Force general John P. Jumper was appointed CEO in 2012, and he oversaw the restructuring of SAIC into SAIC and Leidos. On July 1, 2014, Leidos announced that Roger Krone would become its CEO on July 14, 2014. On February 27, 2023, Leidos announced the appointment of Thomas Bell as Chief Executive Officer starting on May 3, 2023.

== Controversies ==

=== As SAIC ===

Then-SAIC had as part of its management and on its board of directors, many well-known ex-government personnel including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense in the Nixon administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, Director of Central Intelligence under President Clinton; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush administration after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2022, 30 out of 38 Leidos Inc. lobbyists previously held government jobs.

In June 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) paid SAIC million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately. Robert Mueller, FBI Director, testified to a congressional committee, &quot;When SAIC delivered the first product in December 2003 we immediately identified a number of deficiencies – 17 at the outset. That soon cascaded to 50 or more and ultimately to 400 problems with that software ... We were indeed disappointed.&quot;

In 2005, then-SAIC executive vice president Arnold L. Punaro claimed that the company had &quot;fully conformed to the contract we have and gave the taxpayers real value for their money.&quot; He blamed the FBI for the initial problems, saying the agency had a parade of program managers and demanded too many design changes. He stated that during 15 months that SAIC worked on the program, 19 different government managers were involved and 36 contract modifications were ordered. &quot;There were an average of 1.3 changes every day from the FBI, for a total of 399 changes during the period,&quot; Punaro said.

In 2011–2012, then-SAIC was among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates, parties, and outside groups with during the 2011–2012 election cycle according to information from the Federal Election Commission. The top candidate recipient was Barack Obama.

=== As Leidos ===

In a heavily redacted report dated January 3, 2018, the Inspector General for the Department of Defense determined that a supervisor at Leidos made “inappropriate sexual and racial comments to” a female contractor, and that when she complained of a hostile work environment, Leidos retaliated by excluding her from further work on an additional contract. The report found that Leidos&#x27;s claim that the contract employee “exhibited poor performance throughout her employment&quot; lacked supporting evidence. It recommended that U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis “consider appropriate action against Leidos” such as “compensatory damages, including back pay, employee benefits and other terms and conditions of employment” that the contractor would have received under the additional contract.

In 2018, Leidos donated to the Senate campaign of Cindy Hyde-Smith. However, after a video was released showing Hyde-Smith speaking fondly of participating in &quot;public hangings&quot;, Leidos said the company would never have made the donation if it had known about the comment. During Hyde-Smith&#x27;s 2020 re-election bid, Leidos again donated to her.

In 2022, it was revealed Leidos is embroiled in dual criminal investigations concerning potential foreign bribery and antitrust violations. In August 2023, the company received a grand jury subpoena from the Justice Department’s antitrust division related to three government contracts from 2021 and 2022, coinciding with heightened enforcement of antitrust laws by the Biden administration. Additionally, in September 2023, Leidos was served with a separate grand jury subpoena regarding possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, linked to activities within its international operations that were identified in late 2021. The company has stated that it is cooperating with the investigations and conducting its own internal reviews into both matters.

Leidos is facing scrutiny following the leak of internal documents reportedly stolen by hackers, believed to be linked to a previously disclosed breach of a Diligent Corp. system that Leidos utilized. The company is currently investigating the matter, which led to a more than 4% drop in its shares during after-hours trading. A spokesperson confirmed that the leak originated from a prior incident involving a third-party vendor and emphasized that it did not affect Leidos&#x27; network or sensitive customer data. The breach is thought to be connected to a 2022 hack of Diligent&#x27;s subsidiary, Steele Compliance Solutions, which affected fewer than 15 customers, including Leidos. Diligent stated that it promptly notified impacted clients and took corrective actions following the incident.

Leidos is facing increasing scrutiny regarding its handling of sexual assault and harassment incidents at facilities operated for the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP). In a letter from House Science Committee Chair Frank Lucas (R-OK) and Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), the company was criticized for allegedly failing to address these serious issues adequately. This concern follows a 2021 National Science Foundation (NSF) report that highlighted pervasive problems of sexual misconduct in Antarctica. The committee accused Leidos of inaccurately reporting that it had received no sexual assault allegations and claimed that its employees were not fully cooperating with NSF investigators. Leidos has reported five allegations of sexual harassment and zero of sexual assault between May 2017 and April 2022, a claim that Lucas and Lofgren disputed, citing evidence of prior reports. The NSF has since implemented new measures to combat these issues through its Sexual Assault and Harassment Prevention and Response (SAHPR) program. The controversy has drawn attention to the broader challenges of addressing sexual misconduct in remote work environments, with advocacy groups like Ice Allies calling for more robust action since 2019.
