<text>The Serbian Empire (, ) was a medieval Serbian state that emerged from the Kingdom of Serbia. It was established in 1346 by Dušan the Mighty, who significantly expanded the state.

During Dušan&#x27;s rule, Serbia was the most powerful state in Southeast Europe and one of the most powerful European states. It was an Eastern Orthodox multi-ethnic and multi-lingual empire that stretched from the Danube in the north to the Gulf of Corinth in the south, with its capital in Skopje. Dušan also promoted the Serbian Archbishopric to the Serbian Patriarchate. In the Serbian Empire, the region of Kosovo was the most prosperous and densely populated area, serving as a key political, religious, and cultural center. His son and successor, Uroš the Weak, lost most of the territory conquered by Dušan, hence his epithet.

The Serbian Empire effectively ended with the death of Uroš V in 1371 and the break-up of the Serbian state. Some successors of Stefan V claimed the title of Emperor in parts of Serbia until 1402, but the territory in Greece was never recovered. From the ruins of the Serbian Empire, Moravian Serbia emerged as the largest and most powerful Serbian state under the rule of the Lazarević dynasty, later playing the key role in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 against the Ottoman Empire.

==History==
===Establishment===
Stefan Dušan was the son of the Serbian king Stefan Dečanski (r. 1322–1331). After his father&#x27;s accession to the throne, Dušan was awarded with the title of &quot;young king&quot;. Although this title bore significant power in medieval Serbia, Stefan wanted his younger son, Simeon Uroš, to inherit him instead of Dušan. However, Dušan had significant support from the major part of the Serbian nobility, including the Serbian archbishop Danilo, and some of the king&#x27;s most trusted generals, such as Jovan Oliver Grčinić. Tensions slowly rose between the king and his son, especially after the battle of Velbužd, where Dušan showed his military capabilities, and they seem to have culminated when king Stefan raided Zeta, a province in Serbia where Dušan ruled autonomously, being a tradition of Serbian heirs to rule this province. Advised by the nobility, Dušan later marched from Zeta to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father and forced him to surrender the throne. Stefan was later imprisoned in the fortress of Zvečan, where he died.

In 1333, Dušan launched a large attack on the Byzantine empire, at the time ruled by the ambitious emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos, with the help of a deserted Byzantine general, Syrgian. Dušan quickly conquered the cities of Ohrid, Prilep and Kastoria, and attempted to besiege Thessalonica in 1334, but was prevented conquering the city by the death of Syrgian, who had been assassinated by a Byzantine spy. Syrgian was a key figure in Dušan&#x27;s army, as he had earned a great reputation in Greece, convincing Greek citizens to surrender cities rather than fight Dušan&#x27;s armies.

By 1345, Dušan &quot;the Mighty&quot; had expanded his state to cover half of the Balkans, more territory than either the Byzantine Empire or the Second Bulgarian Empire in that time. Therefore, in 1345, in Serres, Dušan proclaimed himself &quot;Tsar&quot; (&quot;Caesar&quot;). On 16 April 1346, in Skopje (former Bulgarian capital), he had himself crowned &quot;Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks&quot;, a title signifying a claim to succession of the Byzantine Empire. The ceremony was performed by the newly elevated Serbian Patriarch Joanikije II, the Bulgarian Patriarch Simeon, and Nicholas, the Archbishop of Ohrid. At the same time, Dušan had his son Uroš crowned as &quot;King of Serbs and Greeks&quot;, giving him nominal rule over the &quot;Serbian lands&quot;, although Dušan was governing the whole state, with special responsibility for the newly acquired Roman (Byzantine) lands. These actions, which the Byzantines received with indignation, appear to have been supported by the Bulgarian Empire and tsar Ivan Alexander, as the Patriarch of Bulgaria Simeon had participated in both the creation of a Serbian Patriarchate of Peć and the imperial coronation of Stefan Uroš IV Dušan. Dushan made marriage alliance with Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander, marrying his sister Helena.

===Reign of Stefan Dušan===


Tsar Dušan doubled the size of Serbian state, seizing territories in all directions, especially south and southeast. Serbia held parts of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moravian Serbia, Kosovo, Zeta, modern North Macedonia, modern Albania, and half of modern Greece. He did not fight a single field battle, instead winning his empire by besieging cities. Dušan undertook a campaign against the Byzantine Empire, which was attempting to avert a deteriorating situation after the destruction caused by the Fourth Crusade. Dušan swiftly seized Thessaly, Albania, Epirus, and most of Macedonia.

After besieging the emperor at Salonica in 1340, he imposed a treaty assuring Serbia sovereignty over regions extending from the Danube to the Gulf of Corinth, from the Adriatic Sea to the Maritsa river, and including parts of southern Bulgaria up to the environs of Adrianople. Bulgaria had never fully recovered since its defeat by the Serbs at the Battle of Velbazhd. The outcome of the battle shaped the balance of power in the Balkans for the next decades to come and although Bulgaria did not lose territory, the Serbs could occupy much of Macedonia. Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander, whose sister Helena Dušan later married, became his ally between 1332 and 1365. Dušan ruled over major central part of the Balkan peninsula. He gave sanctuary to the former regent of the Byzantine Empire, John VI Kantakouzenos, in revolt against the government, and agreed to an alliance.

In 1349 and 1354, Dušan enacted a set of laws known as Dušan&#x27;s Code. The Code was based on Roman-Byzantine law and the first Serbian constitution, St. Sava&#x27;s Nomocanon (1219). It was a Civil and Canon law system, based on the Ecumenical Councils, for the functioning of the state and the Serbian Orthodox Church. In 1355, Dušan began military preparations for new campaigns in the south and east, but suddenly died of an unknown illness in December 1355.

==== Expansion into Bosnia and Dalmatia ====

Bordering Serbia to the west was the banate of Bosnia, ruled by Stephen II Kotromanic. During the reign of Dušan&#x27;s father, Stefan Dečanski, Stephen expanded his rule to the Serbian provinces of Hum and Krajina, which stretched from Dubrovnik on the east to river Cetina on the west, Dušan, being busy with his conquests on the south, tried to solve this territorial dispute with diplomacy, but that did not succeed, as Stephen continually refused or ignored Dušan&#x27;s requests, counting on the help of his Hungarian protector king Louis I.

However, the situation changed when Louis signed a treaty with Dušan, so he could attack the kingdom of Naples without Dušan attacking him from the south. Stephen, feeling that his position in Hum and Krajina is becoming harder to defend, started building fortresses around river Neretva, to strengthen his presence and even went as far as to raid the Serbian province of Travunia, reaching as far as Kotor. Dušan could not tolerate this, so he marched with his army westward.

Dušan led 50,000 infantry and 30,000 cavalry across the Bosnian border. Stephen, knowing he could not face such a force, opted to retreat in front of it in hopes of leading the Serbian army into hard terrain, where he could potentially fight them off. However, this did not work out because Bosnian nobility and even some of Stephen&#x27;s own soldiers, unhappy with his rule, started defecting to Dušan. Dušan soon reached Bobovac, the capital of Bosnia, to which he laid siege. The Bosnian ban fled to Hungary, and Bosnia was left open for Dušan to conquer.

He left a portion of his army to continue besieging Bobovac; sent another portion to conquer the region of Krajina, while he himself led a third portion to conquer Hum. Then, after conquering Hum, Dušan proceeded to enter Dalmatia, in order to secure his sister&#x27;s domains. His sister, Jelena Nemanjic-Subic, was married to the ban of Croatia, Mladen Subic, who died of plague in 1348, leaving his lands to his wife. After his death, Hungarians and Venetians both continually tried to take control over these lands, so Dušan entered Dalmatia to protect his sister&#x27;s legal domains. He was welcomed as a liberator in Sibenik and Trogir, but as the Byzantine emperor John Kantakouzenos attacked Dušan from the south, capturing the city of Veria and Edessa, Dušan was forced to retreat and repel him. While he was on his way back, he was welcomed and prepared a great feast in Dubrovnik, where his wife stayed for some time.

It is unclear if Dušan kept control in these lands. Certain historians say Stephen Kotromanic returned and regained control in Bosnia, but the sources do not mention anything about him after Dušan&#x27;s conquests, until his death in late 1353. Dušan most likely kept control over Dalmatia, since after his conquests, the Serbian Orthodox monastery of Krka was built in that region. Also, he is recorded sending 2 military units under the command of his generals Đuraš Ilijić and Palman Bracht to protect the Dalmatian cities of Klis and Skradin in 1355. Djuras Ilijic surrendered Skradin to the Venetians some time after Dušan&#x27;s death, on 10 January 1356, and Klis was conquered by the Croatian general Nikola Banic for the Hungarian king sometime after 1356, ending Serbian presence in Dalmatia.

===Reign of Stefan Uroš V===
Dušan was succeeded by his son, Stefan Uroš V, called &quot;the Weak,&quot; a term that also described the empire as it slowly slid into feudal anarchy. The failure to consolidate its holdings after a sudden conquest led to the fragmentation of the empire. The period was marked by the rise of a new threat: the Ottoman Turkish sultanate gradually spread from Asia to Europe and conquered first Byzantine Thrace, and then the other Balkan states. Too incompetent to sustain the empire created by his father, Stefan V could neither repel attacks of foreign enemies nor combat the independence of his nobility. The Serbian Empire of Stefan V fragmented into a conglomeration of principalities, some of which did not even nominally acknowledge his rule. Stefan Uroš V died childless on 4 December 1371, after much of the Serbian nobility had been killed by the Ottoman Turks during the Battle of Maritsa.

==Aftermath and legacy==
The crumbling Serbian Empire under Uroš the Weak offered little resistance to the powerful Ottomans. In the wake of internal conflicts and decentralization of the state, the Ottomans defeated the Serbs under Vukašin at the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, making vassals of the southern governors; soon thereafter, the Emperor died. As Uroš was childless and the nobility could not agree on a rightful heir, the Empire continued to be ruled by semi-independent provincial lords, who often were in feud with each other. The most powerful of these, Lazar Hrebeljanović, a Duke of present-day central Serbia (which had not yet come under Ottoman rule), stood against the Ottomans at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. The result was indecisive, but it led to the subsequent fall of Serbia. Stefan Lazarević, the son of Lazar, succeeded as ruler, but by 1394 he had become an Ottoman vassal. In 1402 he renounced Ottoman rule and became a Hungarian ally; the following years are characterized by a power struggle between the Ottomans and Hungary over the territory of Serbia. In 1453, the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, and in 1458 Athens was taken. In 1459, Serbia was annexed, and then Morea a year later. During the following centuries of Ottoman rule, the legacy of former statehood, embodied in the Serbian Empire, became an integral part of Serbian national identity.

==Administration==

===Law===

After finishing most of his conquests, Stefan Dušan dedicated himself to supervising the administration of the empire. One key objective was to create a written legal code, an effort his predecessors had only begun. An assembly of bishops, nobles, and provincial governors was charged with creating a code of laws, bringing together the customs of the Slav countries.

Dušan&#x27;s Code was enacted in two state assemblies, the first on May 21, 1349, in Skopje, and the second in 1354 in Serres. The law regulated all social spheres, thus it is considered a medieval constitution. The Code included 201 articles, based on Roman-Byzantine law. The legal transplanting is notable with the articles 172 and 174 of Dušan&#x27;s Code, which regulated juridical independence. They were taken from the Byzantine code Basilika (book VII, 1, 16–17). The Code had its roots in the first Serbian constitution – &quot;St. Sava&#x27;s Nomocanon&quot; () from 1219, enacted by Saint Sava. St. Sava&#x27;s Nomocanon was the compilation of Civil law, based on Roman Law and Canon law, based on Ecumenical Councils. Its basic purpose was to organize the functions of the state and Serbian Orthodox Church.

The legislation resembled the feudal system then prevalent in Western Europe, with an aristocratic basis and establishing a wide distinction between nobility and peasantry. The monarch had broad powers but was surrounded and advised by a permanent council of magnates and prelates. The court, chancellery and administration were rough copies of those of Constantinople. The code enumerated the administrative hierarchy as following: &quot;lands, cities, župas and krajištes&quot;; the župas and krajištes were one and the same, where župas on the borders were called krajištes (&quot;frontier&quot;). The župa consisted of villages, and their status, rights, and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent &quot;sebri&quot;, the equivalent of Greek &quot;paroikoi&quot;: peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree. The earlier &quot;župan&quot; title was abolished and replaced with the Greek-derived &quot;kefalija&quot; (&quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head, master&quot;).

===Economy===
Commerce was another object of Dušan&#x27;s concern. He gave strict orders to combat piracy and to assure the safety of travelers and foreign merchants. Traditional relations with Venice were resumed, with the port of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) becoming an important transaction point. Exploitation of mines produced appreciable resources.

East-west Roman roads through the empire carried a variety of commodities: wine, manufactures, and luxury goods from the coast; metals, cattle, timber, wool, skins, and leather from the interior. This economic development made possible the creation of the Empire. Important trade routes were the ancient Roman Via Militaris, Via Egnatia, Via de Zenta, and the Kopaonik road, among others. Ragusan merchants in particular had trading privileges throughout the realm. Security of trade and merchants on the roads was a major concern for the state authorities.

Srebrenica, Rudnik, Trepča, Novo Brdo, Kopaonik, Majdanpek, Brskovo, and Samokov were the main centers for mining iron, copper, and lead ores, and silver and gold placers. The silver mines provided much of the royal income, and were worked by slave-labour, managed by Saxons. A colony of Saxons worked the Novo Brdo mines and traded charcoal burners. The silver mines processed an annual 0.5 million dollars (1919 comparation).

The currency used was called &quot;dinars&quot;; an alternative name was &quot;perper&quot;, derived from the Byzantine &quot;hyperpyron&quot;. The &quot;golden dinar&quot; was the largest unit, and the imperial tax was one dinar coin, per house, annually.

==Military==


Serbian military tactics consisted of wedge-shaped heavy cavalry attacks with horse archers on the flanks. Many foreign mercenaries were in the Serbian army, mostly Germans as cavalry and Spaniards as infantry. The army also had personal mercenary guards for the emperor, mainly German knights. A German nobleman, Palman, became the commander of the Serbian &quot;Alemannic Guard&quot; in 1331 upon crossing Serbia on the way to Jerusalem; he became leader of all mercenaries in the Serbian Army. The main strength of the Serbian army were the heavily armoured knights feared for their ferocious charge and fighting skills, as well as hussars, versatile light cavalry formations armed mainly with spears and crossbows, ideal for scouting, raiding and skirmishing.

==State insignia==
The 1339 map by Angelino Dulcert depicts a number of flags, and Serbia is represented by a flag placed above Skoplje (&quot;Skopi&quot;) with the name Serbia near the hoist, which was characteristic for capital cities at the time the drawing was produced. The flag, depicting a red double-headed eagle, represented the realm of Stefan Dušan. A flag in Hilandar, seen by Dimitrije Avramović, was alleged by the brotherhood to have been a flag of Emperor Dušan; it was a triband with red at the top and bottom and white in the center. Emperor Dušan also adopted the Imperial &quot;divelion&quot;, which was purple and had a golden cross in the center. Another of Dušan&#x27;s flags was the Imperial cavalry flag, kept at the Hilandar monastery on Mount Athos; a triangular bicolored flag, of red and yellow.

==Culture==
===Religion===
Influenced by the clergy, Dušan showed extreme severity towards Roman Catholicism. Those who integrated into the Latin Church were condemned to work in mines, and people who propagated it were threatened with death. The Papacy grew concerned about this and the increasing power of Dušan and aroused the old rivalry of the Catholic Hungarians against the Orthodox Serbs. Once again Dušan overcame his enemies from whom he seized Bosnia and Herzegovina, which marked the height of the Serbian Empire in Middle Ages. However, the most serious menace came from the East, from the Turks. Entrenched on the shores of the Dardanelles, the Turks were the common enemies of Christendom. It was against them that the question of uniting and directing all forces in the Balkans to save Europe from the invasion arose. The Serbian Empire already included most of the region, and to transform the peninsula into a cohesive whole under a rule of a single master required seizure of Constantinople to add to Serbia what remained of the Byzantine Empire. Dušan intended to make himself emperor and defender of Christianity against the Islamic wave.

===Education and arts===
Education, to which St. Sava had given the first impulse, progressed remarkably during Dušan&#x27;s reign. Schools and monasteries secured royal favor. True seats of culture, they became institutions in perpetuating Serbian national traditions. The fine arts, influenced by Italians, were not neglected. Architectural monuments, frescoes and mosaics testify the artistic level archived during this period.

<text>The MP 40 (&quot;Maschinenpistole 40&quot;) is a submachine gun chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. Developed in Nazi Germany, it saw extensive service in the Axis forces during World War II.

Designed in 1938 by Heinrich Vollmer with inspiration from its predecessor the , it was heavily used by infantrymen (particularly by platoon- and squad-leaders), and by paratroopers, on the Eastern and Western Fronts as well as by the crews of armoured fighting vehicles. Its advanced and modern features made it a favorite among soldiers and popular in countries from various parts of the world after the war.

The Allies often referred to the MP 40 as the &quot;Schmeisser&quot;, after the firearms-designer Hugo Schmeisser (1884-1953). In 1917 Schmeisser had designed the MP 18, which was the first mass-produced submachine gun. He did not, however, have anything to do with the design or development of the MP 40, although he held a patent on the magazine.

The MP 40&#x27;s variants included the MP 40/I and the MP 41. Erma Werke produced an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s between 1940 and 1945.

==Development==

The &quot;Maschinenpistole 40&quot; (&quot;Machine pistol 40&quot;) descended from its predecessor the MP 38, which was in turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel. The MP 36 was developed independently by Erma Werke&#x27;s Berthold Geipel with funding from the German Army. It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer&#x27;s VPM 1930 and EMP. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel&#x27;s MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the &quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot; (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.

==Design==
The MP 40 submachine guns are open-bolt, blowback-operated automatic arms. The only mode of fire is automatic, but the relatively low rate of fire permits single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide which serves as a pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late-production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also serves as a safety by pushing the head of the handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locks the bolt in either the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop that were used to hold the bolt in the forward position.

The MP 38 receiver was made of machined steel, but this was a time-consuming and expensive process. To save time and materials, and thus increase production, construction of the MP 40 receiver was simplified by using stamped steel and electro-spot welding as much as possible. The MP 38 also features longitudinal grooving on the receiver and bolt, as well as a circular opening on the magazine housing. These features were eliminated on the MP 40.

One feature found on most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns is an aluminum, steel, or Margolit (a variation of Bakelite) resting bar under the barrel. This was used to steady the weapon when firing over the side of open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sd.Kfz. 251 half-track. A handguard, also made of Margolit, is located between the magazine housing and the Margolit pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also has a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.

Although the MP 40 was generally reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, staggered-feed magazine found on the Thompson M1921/1928 variants, the MP 40 uses a double-column, single-feed version. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated by the presence of dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move out of the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handguard on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.

==Usage==

At the outbreak of World War II, the majority of German soldiers carried either Karabiner 98k rifles or MP 40s, both of which were regarded as the standard weapons of choice for an infantryman.

However, later confrontations with Soviet troops such as the Battle of Stalingrad, where entire enemy units were armed with PPSh-41 submachine guns, the Germans found themselves out-gunned in short range urban combat which caused a shift in their tactics, and by the end of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were sometimes issued to entire assault platoons. Starting in 1943, the German military moved to replace both the Karabiner 98k rifle and MP 40 with the new, revolutionary StG 44. By the end of World War II in 1945, an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants.

===Post-war use===
During and after the end of World War II, many MP 40s were captured or surrendered (upwards of 200,000) to the Allies and were then redistributed to the paramilitary and irregular forces of some developing countries. The Norwegian army withdrew the MP 38 from use in 1975 but used the MP 40 for some years more. In particular, the Territorials (Heimevernet) used it until about 1990, when it was replaced by the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5.

==Variants==
===MP 40/I===
The MP 40/I (sometimes erroneously called &quot;MP 40/II&quot;) was a modified version of the standard MP 40 with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the Eastern Front to compensate for the Soviet PPSh-41&#x27;s larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues. Authentic versions, in addition to the dual mag magazine well, also have a smaller buttpad and shortened ejector.

===MP 41===

In 1941, Hugo Schmeisser designed the MP 41, which was, in reality, an MP 40 upper receiver with a lower receiver of an MP 28/II submachine gun. It saw limited service, however, and was issued only to SS and police units in 1944. The MP 41 was also supplied to Germany&#x27;s Axis ally Romania.

Later in 1941, rival company Erma Werke sued Haenel, at which Schmeisser was Chief Designer, for patent infringement. Production subsequently ceased on the MP 41.

== Influence on later weapons ==
The MP 38 and MP 40 also directly influenced the design of later weapons, including the Spanish Star Z45, the Yugoslavian Zastava M56, and the semi-automatic German &quot;Selbstladebüchse BD 38&quot; replica.

Details of the MP 40 have also been adopted in other submachine guns, which otherwise differ significantly from a technical point of view:

* The designers of the American M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot; examined British Sten guns and captured MP 40s for usable construction details. 
* The folding stock became the model for those on later weapons, such as the Soviet PPS-43 and the AKS version of the AK-47.
* The MP 40 magazine can also be used in the Belgian Vigneron submachine gun.

==Users==

During World War II, the resistance and the Allies sometimes captured MP 40s to replace or supplement their own weapons. The MP 40 was used for several decades following World War II by many countries around the world in armed conflicts. Some found their way into guerrilla groups such as the Viet Cong or African guerrillas.

Its operators have included:

== Civilian ownership in the United States ==
During the Allied occupation of Germany starting in 1945, U.S. servicemen shipped home thousands of captured firearms as war trophies, including MP 40s. This practice required proper registration of automatic weapons in accordance with the National Firearms Act before they could be imported, but this was curtailed later in the occupation, meaning a relatively small number of civilian-transferable original German MP 40s remain in circulation and are valued at around $20,000-37,500 as of 2021, with some selling for almost $50,000.

After the commercial importation of complete machine guns was banned by the Gun Control Act of 1968, MP 40 parts kits (the disassembled parts of the gun excluding the receiver tube) were imported and reassembled onto receivers manufactured in the United States by Charles Erb, Wilson Arms, and others. These remanufactured legally transferable machine guns, colloquially called &quot;tube guns&quot;, are (depending on quality of construction and condition) generally valued at 50-75% of the price of original German MP 40s, as they do not have their historical background. As such, they are commonly used for recreational range shooting and WW2 historical reenactments, because the associated wear and tear (within reasonable limits) will not significantly diminish their value, as it would on original collectible examples. Manufacture of new tube guns ceased following the passage of the Firearm Owners Protection Act in 1986.

There are several semi-automatic variants and cosmetic replicas of the MP 40 available for civilian ownership in the U.S. Beginning in 2014, American Tactical Imports began importing an MP 40 replica manufactured by German Sporting Guns GmbH chambered in .22LR, and since 2016 has also imported a pistol variant chambered in 9mm.

<doc id="239516" wikidata="Q1276130" url="?curid=239516" title="Extract, transform, load">
<text>Extract, transform, load (ETL) is a three-phase computing process where data is &quot;extracted&quot; from an input source, &quot;transformed&quot; (including cleaning), and &quot;loaded&quot; into an output data container. The data can be collected from one or more sources and it can also be output to one or more destinations. ETL processing is typically executed using software applications but it can also be done manually by system operators. ETL software typically automates the entire process and can be run manually or on recurring schedules either as single jobs or aggregated into a batch of jobs.

A properly designed ETL system extracts data from source systems and enforces data type and data validity standards and ensures it conforms structurally to the requirements of the output. Some ETL systems can also deliver data in a presentation-ready format so that application developers can build applications and end users can make decisions.

The ETL process is often used in data warehousing. ETL systems commonly integrate data from multiple applications (systems), typically developed and supported by different vendors or hosted on separate computer hardware. The separate systems containing the original data are frequently managed and operated by different stakeholders. For example, a cost accounting system may combine data from payroll, sales, and purchasing.

Data extraction involves extracting data from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources; data transformation processes data by data cleaning and transforming it into a proper storage format/structure for the purposes of querying and analysis; finally, data loading describes the insertion of data into the final target database such as an operational data store, a data mart, data lake or a data warehouse.

== Phases ==

=== Extract ===

ETL processing involves extracting the data from the source system(s). In many cases, this represents the most important aspect of ETL, since extracting data correctly sets the stage for the success of subsequent processes. Most data-warehousing projects combine data from different source systems. Each separate system may also use a different data organization and/or format. Common data-source formats include relational databases, flat-file databases, XML, and JSON, but may also include non-relational database structures such as IBM Information Management System or other data structures such as Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) or Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM), or even formats fetched from outside sources by means such as a web crawler or data scraping. The streaming of the extracted data source and loading on-the-fly to the destination database is another way of performing ETL when no intermediate data storage is required.

An intrinsic part of the extraction involves data validation to confirm whether the data pulled from the sources has the correct/expected values in a given domain (such as a pattern/default or list of values). If the data fails the validation rules, it is rejected entirely or in part. The rejected data is ideally reported back to the source system for further analysis to identify and to rectify incorrect records or perform data wrangling.

=== Transform ===

In the data transformation stage, a series of rules or functions are applied to the extracted data in order to prepare it for loading into the end target.

An important function of transformation is data cleansing, which aims to pass only &quot;proper&quot; data to the target. The challenge when different systems interact is in the relevant systems&#x27; interfacing and communicating. Character sets that may be available in one system may not be in others.

In other cases, one or more of the following transformation types may be required to meet the business and technical needs of the server or data warehouse:
* Selecting only certain columns to load: (or selecting null columns not to load). For example, if the source data has three columns (aka &quot;attributes&quot;), roll_no, age, and salary, then the selection may take only roll_no and salary. Or, the selection mechanism may ignore all those records where salary is not present (salary = null).
* Translating coded values: (&quot;e.g.&quot;, if the source system codes male as &quot;1&quot; and female as &quot;2&quot;, but the warehouse codes male as &quot;M&quot; and female as &quot;F&quot;)
* Encoding free-form values: (&quot;e.g.&quot;, mapping &quot;Male&quot; to &quot;M&quot;)
* Deriving a new calculated value: (&quot;e.g.&quot;, sale_amount = qty * unit_price)
* Sorting or ordering the data based on a list of columns to improve search performance
* Joining data from multiple sources (&quot;e.g.&quot;, lookup, merge) and deduplicating the data
* Aggregating (for example, rollup – summarizing multiple rows of data – total sales for each store, and for each region, etc.)
* Generating surrogate-key values
* Transposing or pivoting (turning multiple columns into multiple rows or vice versa)
* Splitting a column into multiple columns (&quot;e.g.&quot;, converting a comma-separated list, specified as a string in one column, into individual values in different columns)
* Disaggregating repeating columns
* Looking up and validating the relevant data from tables or referential files
* Applying any form of data validation; failed validation may result in a full rejection of the data, partial rejection, or no rejection at all, and thus none, some, or all of the data is handed over to the next step depending on the rule design and exception handling; many of the above transformations may result in exceptions, e.g., when a code translation parses an unknown code in the extracted data

=== Load ===

The load phase loads the data into the end target, which can be any data store including a simple delimited flat file or a data warehouse. Depending on the requirements of the organization, this process varies widely. Some data warehouses may overwrite existing information with cumulative information; updating extracted data is frequently done on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Other data warehouses (or even other parts of the same data warehouse) may add new data in a historical form at regular intervals – for example, hourly. To understand this, consider a data warehouse that is required to maintain sales records of the last year. This data warehouse overwrites any data older than a year with newer data. However, the entry of data for any one year window is made in a historical manner. The timing and scope to replace or append are strategic design choices dependent on the time available and the business needs. More complex systems can maintain a history and audit trail of all changes to the data loaded in the data warehouse.
As the load phase interacts with a database, the constraints defined in the database schema – as well as in triggers activated upon data load – apply (for example, uniqueness, referential integrity, mandatory fields), which also contribute to the overall data quality performance of the ETL process.

* For example, a financial institution might have information on a customer in several departments and each department might have that customer&#x27;s information listed in a different way. The membership department might list the customer by name, whereas the accounting department might list the customer by number. ETL can bundle all of these data elements and consolidate them into a uniform presentation, such as for storing in a database or data warehouse.
* Another way that companies use ETL is to move information to another application permanently. For instance, the new application might use another database vendor and most likely a very different database schema. ETL can be used to transform the data into a format suitable for the new application to use.
* An example would be an expense and cost recovery system such as used by accountants, consultants, and law firms. The data usually ends up in the time and billing system, although some businesses may also utilize the raw data for employee productivity reports to Human Resources (personnel dept.) or equipment usage reports to Facilities Management.

=== Additional phases ===

A real-life ETL cycle may consist of additional execution steps, for example:

# Cycle initiation
# Build reference data
# Extract (from sources)

== Design Challenges ==

ETL processes can involve considerable complexity, and significant operational problems can occur with improperly designed ETL systems.

=== Data variations ===

The range of data values or data quality in an operational system may exceed the expectations of designers at the time validation and transformation rules are specified. Data profiling of a source during data analysis can identify the data conditions that must be managed by transform rules specifications, leading to an amendment of validation rules explicitly and implicitly implemented in the ETL process.

Data warehouses are typically assembled from a variety of data sources with different formats and purposes. As such, ETL is a key process to bring all the data together in a standard, homogeneous environment.

Design analysis should establish the scalability of an ETL system across the lifetime of its usage – including understanding the volumes of data that must be processed within service level agreements. The time available to extract from source systems may change, which may mean the same amount of data may have to be processed in less time. Some ETL systems have to scale to process terabytes of data to update data warehouses with tens of terabytes of data. Increasing volumes of data may require designs that can scale from daily batch to multiple-day micro batch to integration with message queues or real-time change-data-capture for continuous transformation and update.

=== Uniqueness of keys ===

Unique keys play an important part in all relational databases, as they tie everything together. A unique key is a column that identifies a given entity, whereas a foreign key is a column in another table that refers to a primary key. Keys can comprise several columns, in which case they are composite keys. In many cases, the primary key is an auto-generated integer that has no meaning for the business entity being represented, but solely exists for the purpose of the relational database – commonly referred to as a surrogate key.

As there is usually more than one data source getting loaded into the warehouse, the keys are an important concern to be addressed. For example: customers might be represented in several data sources, with their Social Security number as the primary key in one source, their phone number in another, and a surrogate in the third. Yet a data warehouse may require the consolidation of all the customer information into one dimension.

A recommended way to deal with the concern involves adding a warehouse surrogate key, which is used as a foreign key from the fact table.

Usually, updates occur to a dimension&#x27;s source data, which obviously must be reflected in the data warehouse.

If the primary key of the source data is required for reporting, the dimension already contains that piece of information for each row. If the source data uses a surrogate key, the warehouse must keep track of it even though it is never used in queries or reports; it is done by creating a lookup table that contains the warehouse surrogate key and the originating key. This way, the dimension is not polluted with surrogates from various source systems, while the ability to update is preserved.

The lookup table is used in different ways depending on the nature of the source data.
There are 5 types to consider; three are included here:
;Type 1
:The dimension row is simply updated to match the current state of the source system; the warehouse does not capture history; the lookup table is used to identify the dimension row to update or overwrite
;Type 2
:A new dimension row is added with the new state of the source system; a new surrogate key is assigned; source key is no longer unique in the lookup table
;Fully logged
:A new dimension row is added with the new state of the source system, while the previous dimension row is updated to reflect it is no longer active and time of deactivation.

=== Performance ===

ETL vendors benchmark their record-systems at multiple TB (terabytes) per hour (or ~1 GB per second) using powerful servers with multiple CPUs, multiple hard drives, multiple gigabit-network connections, and much memory.

In real life, the slowest part of an ETL process usually occurs in the database load phase. Databases may perform slowly because they have to take care of concurrency, integrity maintenance, and indices. Thus, for better performance, it may make sense to employ:
* &quot;Direct path extract&quot; method or bulk unload whenever is possible (instead of querying the database) to reduce the load on source system while getting high-speed extract
* Most of the transformation processing outside of the database
* Bulk load operations whenever possible

Still, even using bulk operations, database access is usually the bottleneck in the ETL process. Some common methods used to increase performance are:
* Partition tables (and indices): try to keep partitions similar in size (watch for codice_1 values that can skew the partitioning)
* Do all validation in the ETL layer before the load: disable integrity checking (codice_2 ...) in the target database tables during the load
* Disable triggers (codice_3 ...) in the target database tables during the load: simulate their effect as a separate step
* Generate IDs in the ETL layer (not in the database)
* Drop the indices (on a table or partition) before the load – and recreate them after the load (SQL: codice_4 ...codice_5 ...)
* Use parallel bulk load when possible – works well when the table is partitioned or there are no indices (Note: attempting to do parallel loads into the same table (partition) usually causes locks – if not on the data rows, then on indices)
* If a requirement exists to do insertions, updates, or deletions, find out which rows should be processed in which way in the ETL layer, and then process these three operations in the database separately; you often can do bulk load for inserts, but updates and deletes commonly go through an API (using SQL)

Whether to do certain operations in the database or outside may involve a trade-off. For example, removing duplicates using codice_6 may be slow in the database; thus, it makes sense to do it outside. On the other side, if using codice_6 significantly (x100) decreases the number of rows to be extracted, then it makes sense to remove duplications as early as possible in the database before unloading data.

A common source of problems in ETL is a big number of dependencies among ETL jobs. For example, job &quot;B&quot; cannot start while job &quot;A&quot; is not finished. One can usually achieve better performance by visualizing all processes on a graph, and trying to reduce the graph making maximum use of parallelism, and making &quot;chains&quot; of consecutive processing as short as possible. Again, partitioning of big tables and their indices can really help.

Another common issue occurs when the data are spread among several databases, and processing is done in those databases sequentially. Sometimes database replication may be involved as a method of copying data between databases – it can significantly slow down the whole process. The common solution is to reduce the processing graph to only three layers:

* Sources
* Central ETL layer
* Targets

This approach allows processing to take maximum advantage of parallelism. For example, if you need to load data into two databases, you can run the loads in parallel (instead of loading into the first – and then replicating into the second).

Sometimes processing must take place sequentially. For example, dimensional (reference) data are needed before one can get and validate the rows for main &quot;fact&quot; tables.

=== Parallel computing ===

Some ETL software implementations include parallel processing. This enables a number of methods to improve overall performance of ETL when dealing with large volumes of data.

ETL applications implement three main types of parallelism:

* Data: By splitting a single sequential file into smaller data files to provide parallel access
* Pipeline: allowing the simultaneous running of several components on the same data stream, e.g. looking up a value on record 1 at the same time as adding two fields on record 2
* Component: The simultaneous running of multiple processes on different data streams in the same job, e.g. sorting one input file while removing duplicates on another file

All three types of parallelism usually operate combined in a single job or task.

An additional difficulty comes with making sure that the data being uploaded is relatively consistent. Because multiple source databases may have different update cycles (some may be updated every few minutes, while others may take days or weeks), an ETL system may be required to hold back certain data until all sources are synchronized. Likewise, where a warehouse may have to be reconciled to the contents in a source system or with the general ledger, establishing synchronization and reconciliation points becomes necessary.

=== Failure recovery ===

Data warehousing procedures usually subdivide a big ETL process into smaller pieces running sequentially or in parallel. To keep track of data flows, it makes sense to tag each data row with &quot;row_id&quot;, and tag each piece of the process with &quot;run_id&quot;. In case of a failure, having these IDs help to roll back and rerun the failed piece.

Best practice also calls for &quot;checkpoints&quot;, which are states when certain phases of the process are completed. Once at a checkpoint, it is a good idea to write everything to disk, clean out some temporary files, log the state, etc.

== Implementations ==

An established ETL framework may improve connectivity and scalability. A good ETL tool must be able to communicate with the many different relational databases and read the various file formats used throughout an organization. ETL tools have started to migrate into enterprise application integration, or even enterprise service bus, systems that now cover much more than just the extraction, transformation, and loading of data. Many ETL vendors now have data profiling, data quality, and metadata capabilities. A common use case for ETL tools include converting CSV files to formats readable by relational databases. A typical translation of millions of records is facilitated by ETL tools that enable users to input csv-like data feeds/files and import them into a database with as little code as possible.

ETL tools are typically used by a broad range of professionals – from students in computer science looking to quickly import large data sets to database architects in charge of company account management, ETL tools have become a convenient tool that can be relied on to get maximum performance. ETL tools in most cases contain a GUI that helps users conveniently transform data, using a visual data mapper, as opposed to writing large programs to parse files and modify data types.

While ETL tools have traditionally been for developers and IT staff, research firm Gartner wrote that the new trend is to provide these capabilities to business users so they can themselves create connections and data integrations when needed, rather than going to the IT staff. Gartner refers to these non-technical users as Citizen Integrators.

== Variations ==

=== In online transaction processing ===

In online transaction processing (OLTP) applications, changes from individual OLTP instances are detected and logged into a snapshot, or batch, of updates. An ETL instance can be used to periodically collect all of these batches, transform them into a common format, and load them into a data lake or warehouse.

=== Virtual ETL ===

Data virtualization can be used to advance ETL processing. The application of data virtualization to ETL allowed solving the most common ETL tasks of data migration and application integration for multiple dispersed data sources. Virtual ETL operates with the abstracted representation of the objects or entities gathered from the variety of relational, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources. ETL tools can leverage object-oriented modeling and work with entities&#x27; representations persistently stored in a centrally located hub-and-spoke architecture. Such a collection that contains representations of the entities or objects gathered from the data sources for ETL processing is called a metadata repository and it can reside in memory or be made persistent. By using a persistent metadata repository, ETL tools can transition from one-time projects to persistent middleware, performing data harmonization and data profiling consistently and in near-real time.

=== Extract, load, transform (ELT) ===
Extract, load, transform (ELT) is a variant of ETL where the extracted data is loaded into the target system first. The architecture for the analytics pipeline shall also consider where to cleanse and enrich data as well as how to conform dimensions. Some of the benefits of an ELT process include speed and the ability to more easily handle both unstructured and structured data.

Ralph Kimball and Joe Caserta&#x27;s book The Data Warehouse ETL Toolkit, (Wiley, 2004), which is used as a textbook for courses teaching ETL processes in data warehousing, addressed this issue.

Cloud-based data warehouses like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics and Snowflake Inc. have been able to provide highly scalable computing power. This lets businesses forgo preload transformations and replicate raw data into their data warehouses, where it can transform them as needed using SQL.

After having used ELT, data may be processed further and stored in a data mart.

Most data integration tools skew towards ETL, while ELT is popular in database and data warehouse appliances. Similarly, it is possible to perform TEL (Transform, Extract, Load) where data is first transformed on a blockchain (as a way of recording changes to data, e.g., token burning) before extracting and loading into another data store.

<doc id="239517" wikidata="Q380012" url="?curid=239517" title="Adverbial">
<text>In English grammar, an adverbial (abbreviated ) is a word (an adverb) or a group of words (an adverbial clause or adverbial phrase) that modifies or more closely defines the sentence or the verb. (The word &quot;adverbial&quot; itself is also used as an adjective, meaning &quot;having the same function as an adverb&quot;.) Look at the examples below:

:&quot;Danny speaks fluently.&quot; (telling more about the verb)
:&quot;Lorna ate breakfast yesterday morning&quot;. (telling when the verb&#x27;s action occurred)

== The form of adverbials ==
Adverbials most commonly take the form of adverbs, adverb phrases, temporal noun phrases or prepositional phrases. Many types of adverbials (for instance: reason and condition) are often expressed by clauses.
:&quot;James answered immediately&quot;. (adverb)
:&quot;James answered in English.&quot; (prepositional phrase)
:&quot;James answered this morning.&quot; (noun phrase)
:&quot;James answered in English because he had a foreign visitor&quot;. (adverbial clause)
An adverbial is a construction which modifies or describes verbs. When an adverbial modifies a verb, it changes the meaning of that verb. This may be performed by an adverb or a word group, either considered an adverbial: for example, a prepositional phrase, a noun phrase, a finite clause or a non-finite clause.

== Types of adverbials that form sentence elements ==
Adverbials are typically divided into four classes:

Adverbial complements (i.e. obligatory adverbial) are adverbials that render a sentence ungrammatical and meaningless if removed.

:&quot;John put the flowers in the water.&quot;

Adjuncts: These are part of the core meaning of the sentence, but if omitted still leave a meaningful sentence.

:&quot;John and Sophia helped me with my homework.&quot;

Conjuncts: These link two sentences together.

:&quot;John helped; therefore, I was able to do my homework.&quot;

Disjuncts: These make comments on the meaning of the rest of the sentence.

:&quot;Surprisingly, he passed all of his exams&quot;.

== Distinguishing an adverbial from an adjunct ==
All verb- or sentence-modifying adjuncts are adverbials, but some adverbials are not adjuncts.

* If the removal of an adverbial does not leave a well-formed sentence, then it is not an adjunct
* If the adverbial modifies within a sentence element, and is not a sentence element in its own right, it is not an adjunct.
* If the adverbial is not grammatically tied to the sentence it is not an adjunct, e.g.

:&quot;Mr Reninson, however, voted against the proposal&quot;. (adverbial conjunct not adjunct)

==Other types of adverbials==

===Directional and locative particles===
Prepositions (&quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot;, etc.) may be used adverbially to indicate direction or location.

*Superman flew in. (directional)
*Are you in? (locative)
*The car drove out. (directional)
*The ball is out. (locative)

===Negators===
In some grammar models, negators such as &quot;not&quot; and &quot;never&quot; are considered adverbs with the function of negating adverbial clauses.

===Expletives===
Often ignored, expletives may take up many adverbial syntactic functions. Pragmatically and semantically, they often serve as intensifiers, boosting the content of the clause they appear in.

*What the hell are you talking about?
*You&#x27;re freaking lying!
*You bloody well know that smoking&#x27;s not allowed here!
*He got sodding killed.

<text>The MG 34 (shortened from German: &quot;Maschinengewehr 34&quot;, or &quot;machine gun 34&quot;) is a German recoil-operated air-cooled general-purpose machine gun, first tested in 1929, introduced in 1934, and issued to units in 1936. It introduced an entirely new concept in automatic firepower – the &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; (Universal machine gun) – and is generally considered the world&#x27;s first general-purpose machine gun (GPMG). Both the MG 34 and MG 42 were erroneously nicknamed &quot;Spandau&quot; by Allied troops, a carryover from the World War I nickname for the MG 08, which was produced at the Spandau Arsenal.

The versatile MG 34 was chambered for the fully-powered 7.92×57mm Mauser rifle cartridge and was arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time of its deployment. The MG 34 was envisaged and well-developed to provide portable light and medium machine gun infantry cover, anti-aircraft coverage, and even sniping ability. Its combination of exceptional mobility – being light enough to be carried by one man – and high rate of fire (of up to 900 rounds per minute) was unmatched. It entered service in great numbers from 1939. Nonetheless, the design proved to be rather complex for mass production and was supplemented by the cheaper and simpler MG 42, though both remained in service and production until the end of the war.

==History==

===Before World War I===
Even before World War I, the German military was already looking forward to replacing the heavy machine guns which proved to be such a success in that war. The MG13 was one of the first developments toward a goal of producing a weapon that could perform multiple roles, rather than just one. The MG13 was the result of reengineering the Dreyse Water-cooled machine gun to fit the new requirement. The twin-barreled Gast gun was developed with the goal of providing a high cyclic rate of fire weapon for anti-aircraft use and was reported to have reached cyclic rates of fire as high as 1,600 rounds per minute.

The &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; concept required that the operator could radically transform the machine gun for several purposes by changing its mount, sights and feed mechanism.
One of the &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; roles was to provide low-level anti-aircraft coverage. A high cyclic rate of fire is advantageous for use against targets that are exposed to a general-purpose machine gun for a limited time span, like aircraft or targets that minimize their exposure time by quickly moving from cover to cover. For targets that can be fired on by a general-purpose machine gun for longer periods than just a few seconds, the cyclic firing rate becomes less important.

===After World War I===
After World War I the German military faced restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty restricted the German &quot;Reichswehr&quot; (Realm Defence) to maximally stockpiling 792 heavy (bulky hard-to-maneuver water-cooled) machine guns and 1,134 light machine guns and actual production of machine guns and development of sustained fire weapons were prohibited. From 1933 Nazi Germany was committed to repudiating the Treaty of Versailles and its restrictions. As part of a (clandestine) military revitalization program the German military sought avenues to get around restrictions imposed by the treaty by resorting to innovative weapon design and engineering, German arms designers working abroad and other foreign assistance.

===Development of the MG 34===
In 1932 the &quot;Reichswehrministerium&quot; (Ministry of the Reichswehr) ordered several companies, including Rheinmetall, to develop a new &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; (Universal machine gun) to replace several role specific machine guns then in German use. The following specifications for the gun were set:
* light weight
* simplified operation
* quick-change barrel
* single-shot capability as well as two (fast and slower) cyclic rates

The MG 34 was based on a 1930 Rheinmetall design under the direction of Louis Stange at Rheinmetall&#x27;s Sömmerda office, the MG 30. The Swiss and Austrian militaries had both licensed and produced the MG 30 from Rheinmetall shortly after it was patented and the gun started to enter service in Switzerland. The technical challenges in meeting the &quot;Reichswehrministerium&quot; specifications were broader than the gun development itself. It also encompassed various mounts and other accessories that had to adapt that gun to different roles. The MG 30 design was adapted and modified by Heinrich Vollmer of Mauser Industries. Vollmer originally designed the feed mechanism to accept MG 13/MG 15 inspired 75-round &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; spring-loaded saddle-drum magazines. The &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; was a rather complex magazine for which a filling device had to be used and requiring ordnance personnel and a special tool to optimize the spring tension for reliable feeding. Users were ordered not to adjust the drum spring tension.
The result, the multiple role capable MG 34, wherein Rheinmetall&#x27;s Sömmerda plant had a significant influence, reflected the &quot;Reichswehrministerium&quot; specifications.

In 1937 the feed was redesigned to use reusable non-disintegrating &quot;Gurt 33&quot; and &quot;Gurt 34&quot; metal belts and a 50-round &quot;Gurttrommel 34&quot; (belt drum). 
The feeding system was based on the direct push-through of the cartridge out of the link into the gun&#x27;s chamber. Accordingly, the link had to be of the half-open type to enable the motion of the bolt through the link.
Vollmer also increased the rate of fire. The MG 34&#x27;s double crescent trigger dictated either semiautomatic or fully automatic firing modes. The capability to use the previous 75-round &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; saddle-drum magazines (with a required change of the feed cover for a &quot;Trommelhalter&quot; magazine holder) was retained.

As the MG 34 was technically based on and featured design elements of several other machine guns, the German arms industry under the guidance of the &quot;Waffenamt&quot; (German Army Weapons Agency) negotiated and worked out complex royalties and patents matters regarding the MG 34 to every involved side&#x27;s satisfaction.

Before large scale production commenced, 2,300 MG 34s in two main early versions, slightly more complex and different from the final design, were produced between 1935 and 1939. At the time it was introduced, it had a number of advanced features and the general-purpose machine gun concept that it aspired to was an influential one. A little-known feature of these first 2,300 weapons was a device that could be used to change the rate of fire of the weapon. This cadence regulator, which was designed as a flick-force brake, was located in the grip of the weapon. The designer of the MG 34, Louis Stange, was granted the corresponding patent (No. 686 843) at the end of 1939.

During the period between 1934 and the adoption of the final version the &quot;Waffenamt&quot; realized the MG 34 &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; was too complex and expensive to mass-produce and started looking for ways to simplify and rationalize the technical concept. In 1937, the &quot;Waffenamt&quot; requested three companies to submit new more economical &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; designs.

===Adoption of the MG 34 and next &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; generation===
The final version of the MG 34 was eventually adopted for main service on 24 January 1939.
The MG 34 was the mainstay of German Army support weapons from the time of its first pre large scale production issue in 1935 until 1942, when it was supplanted by the next &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; generation Maschinengewehr 42 or MG 42. Although the MG 34 was reliable when competently maintained, it was sensitive to extreme weather conditions, dirt, and mud. Its dissemination throughout the German forces was hampered due to its elaborately milled precision engineering with tight tolerances and use of high-quality metal alloys, which resulted in high machine time, skilled labor requirements, production costs and a relatively slow rate of production. MG 34 production during the war amounted to over 350,000 units (12,822 units in 1939, 54,826 in 1940, 80,952 in 1941, 63,163 in 1942, 48,802 in 1943, 61,396 in 1944, and 20,297 in 1945). Attempts to incrementally improve the fundamental drawbacks of the basic MG 34 design failed. For its successor, the faster firing, less complex, sensitive and cheaper MG 42, the Germans instead used mass production techniques similar to those that created the MP 40 submachine gun. In 1943, MG 42 production surpassed MG 34 production and continued to do so until the end of the war. The Germans nevertheless continued widespread production of MG 34s in parallel until the end of the war.

==Combat use==
In the field, the weapon could operate in offensive or defensive applications. The offensive model, with a mobile soldier, used either a 50-round &quot;Gurttrommel&quot; or a 75-round &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot;. In a stationary defensive role, the gun was mounted on a bipod or tripod and fed by a non-disintegrating metal ammunition belt. Belts were carried in boxes of five. Each belt contained 50 rounds. Belt lengths could be linked for sustained fire. During sustained fire, barrels would have to be changed at intervals due to the heat generated by the rapid rate of fire. If the barrels were not changed properly, the weapon would misfire. Changing barrels was a rapid process for the trained operator and involved disengaging a latch and swinging the receiver to the right for the insertion of a new barrel into the barrel shroud. Accordingly, stationary defensive positions required more than one operator. The weapon was cocked by a non-reciprocating charging handle located at the bottom right of the receiver.

=== Europe ===
The MG 34 was used as the primary infantry machine gun, and remained as the primary armored vehicle defensive weapon as it took limited space to change barrels inside a vehicle. The MG 34 was intended to replace the MG 13 and other older machine guns, but these were still being used in World War II as demand was never met. It was intended to be replaced in infantry service by the MG 42, but there were never enough MG 42s, and MG 34s continued to be used in all roles until the end of World War II.

It was the standard machine gun of the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) and was also used as a secondary weapon on most German tanks and other armoured vehicles used during World War II.

=== East Asia ===
MG 34s captured by the British and Soviet armies were sent to both Chinese Nationalist and Chinese Communist forces during World War II and the Chinese Civil War. The French army sent captured MG 34s to Indochina during the Indochina War. Some models captured from the Germans by the Soviets or manufactured in Czechoslovakia post-WWII were supplied to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army/People&#x27;s Volunteer Army, PAVN and the Viet Cong during the Cold War. Several hundred more MG 34s that were in use with these groups were taken from either French or other Western nations fielding captured German weapons fighting against them in colonial wars or anti-communist conflicts.

==Small arms doctrine==
The German tactical infantry doctrine of the era based a (10-man &quot;Gruppe&quot;) squad&#x27;s firepower on the general-purpose machine gun in the light machine gun role. The advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit.
It was possible for operating crews to lay down a non-stop barrage of fire, pausing only when the barrel had to be replaced. This allowed the MG 34 to tie up significantly larger numbers of enemy troops than was otherwise possible. The Americans and the British trained their troops to take cover from the fire of an MG 34, and assault the position during the small time window of barrel replacement.

The German military instructed that sustained cyclic rate fire must be avoided at all costs. In the bipod-mounted light machine gun role, MG 34 users were trained to fire short bursts and strive to optimize their aim between bursts fired in succession. According to comparative tests by the US military under battle conditions, 7 to 10 rounds bursts with 15 bursts in a minute were most effective. For its medium machine gun role, the MG 34 was matched to the newly developed &quot;Lafette 34&quot; tripod. In the tripod-mounted medium machine gun role, general-purpose machine gun users were trained to fire short bursts and bursts of 20 to 50 rounds and strive to optimize their aim between bursts fired in succession. As a consequence of factors like the time spent reloading, aiming, changing hot barrels if necessary to allow for cooling, the MG 34&#x27;s practical effective rate of fire was 150 rounds per minute.

The Allied nations&#x27; infantry doctrines of World War II based a squad&#x27;s/rifle section&#x27;s firepower centered on the rifleman and/or a magazine fed light machine gun (BAR, Bren, DP-27/DPM, FM 24/29), and they utilised weapons with cyclic fire rates of typically 450–600 rounds per minute.

===Light machine gun fire support role===
A German infantry &quot;Gruppe&quot; (squad) at the start of the war consisted of ten men: a non-commissioned officer or &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; squad leader, deputy squad leader, a three-man machine gun team (machine gunner, assistant gunner/loader and ammunition carrier) and five riflemen. The riflemen carried additional ammunition for the machine gun, hand grenades, explosive charges or a machine gun tripod as required and provided security and covering fire for the machine gun team. A full &quot;Gruppe&quot; (squad) carried 1,800 rounds of ammunition for the machine gun between them.

===Medium machine gun fire support role===
In the German heavy machine gun (HMG) platoons, each platoon served four MG 34/MG 42 machine guns, used in the sustained fire mode mounted on tripods. In 1944, this was altered to six machine guns in three sections with two seven-man heavy machine gun squads per section as follows:
*Squad leader (NCO) MP40
*Machine gunner (private) MG 34/MG 42 and Walther P38
*Assistant gunner (private) pistol
*Three riflemen (privates) rifles
*Horse leader for horse, cart and trailer (private) rifle

The optimum operating crew of an MG 34 in its medium machine gun role was six men: the squad leader, the machine gunner who carried and fired the gun, the assistant gunner/loader who carried the tripod, and three riflemen who carried 1,800 rounds of ammunition between them, spare barrels, entrenching tools, and other items.

To enable the machine gun for its long-range direct fire and indirect fire support roles, optical sights could be added to a &quot;Zielfernrohrhalter&quot; (optical sight mounting bracket) on the tripod, allowing operating crews to continue using advanced planned and unplanned firing methods developed during World War I, though plunging fire or indirect fire methods were not as commonly used by machine gunners during World War II as they were during World War I.

==Design details==

===Operating system===
The MG 34 fires from an open bolt and this format both keeps the barrel open at both ends after firing ceases, allowing airflow through it and helping it to cool faster, and meanwhile retains the next unfired bullet outside the chamber until the trigger is squeezed again; and thus the cartridges are protected from the risk of cook-offs from high chamber temperatures after long bouts of sustained automatic fire. The firearm was designed with a rotating bolt operated by short recoil aided by a muzzle booster. When the firearm is ready to fire the bolt is pulled back to the rear and is held back by the sear. With the pull of the trigger the sear disengages sending the bolt forward under pressure from the recoil spring. A cartridge is stripped from the magazine or belt and the round is pushed into the chamber. As the bolt moves forward into battery the bolt rotates engaging the locking lugs and chamber locking the bolt to the barrel. The striker strikes and ignites the primer and the round is fired. The recoil causes the barrel and bolt to move backwards a short distance. The rearward movement of the barrel causes the rotating bolt to rotate back disengaging the locking lugs and unlocking the bolt from the barrel. The barrel returns to its forward position while the bolt recoils to its rear position. The spent cartridge case is ejected downward through an ejection port normally covered by a spring-loaded dust cover at the bottom of the receiver, just in front of the trigger group and the cycle can begin anew. The spring-loaded dust cover automatically opens when the gun is fired, but the user has to close it after firing to prevent dirt entering the receiver through the open port.

===Sights===
The MG 34 came with a standard iron sight line consisting of a notched &#x27;V&#x27; sight mounted to a post in the rear and a single blade at the front. The sight came calibrated for ranges between in meter increments. The standard sight line had a sight radius.

The MG 34 could accept a variety of different sighting systems, such as a spider web-type anti-aircraft sight or telescopic sights for use in specialty roles.

An active infrared device, intended primarily for night use, and consisting of a specialized mount, active infrared spotlight and accompanying infrared image converter was developed that could be used with the MG 34 and MG 42. In the later stages of World War II the bulky &quot;Fahr- und Zielgerät FG 1250&quot; (driving and aiming device FG 1250) active infrared unit was paired on Sd.Kfz. 251/1 &quot;Falke&quot; half-track armored personnel carriers to some MG 34 and MG 42 machine guns.

===Feeding===
The MG 34 could use non-disintegrating metallic-link belts, which have links that wrap around the cartridge case and are linked by a coiling wire on each side. The belts are intended for multiple reuse. Operation through the feed block is in one step by a feed arm housed in the feed cover. According to U.S. Ordnance Department tests, performed in 1942, the MG 34 was capable of lifting 75 rounds of belted ammunition during firing. The feeding system was based on the direct push-through of the cartridge out of the link into the gun&#x27;s chamber. Accordingly, the link had to be of the half-open type to enable the motion of the bolt through the link. During World War II the &quot;Gurt 34/41&quot;-belt family was introduced. &quot;Gurt 34/41&quot; belt links and wire spirals were made of thinner material — the &quot;Gurt 34&quot; links were made of and &quot;Gurt 34/41&quot; links of thick stamped steel sheet metal — that saved ⅓ of metal and counterintuitively yielded improved performance. Belts were supplied in a fixed length of 50 rounds, but could be linked up to make longer belts for sustained firing. Ammunition boxes contained 250 rounds in five 50-round belts. A 250-round &quot;Patronengurt 33&quot; belt was also issued to machine guns installed in fixed emplacements such as bunkers. &quot;Patronenkasten 34&quot; and &quot;Patronenkasten 41&quot; ammunition boxes could hold up to 300 belted rounds. The &quot;Patronenkasten&quot; could contain an &quot;Einführstück&quot; belt starter-segment.
The 50-round &quot;Gurttrommel&quot; assault drum designed to be clipped to the left side of the gun was an alternative feed option. It was not a true magazine but held a coiled 50-round belt and corresponding &quot;Einführstück&quot; starter-segment preventing it from snagging, twisting and getting stuck during mobile assaults. The &quot;Gurttrommel&quot; belt container was commonly used until the end of World War II, with the MG 34 and MG 42.
The 75-round &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; &quot;double drum&quot; magazine was the original pre-redesign feed method. This double drum or saddle magazine type was introduced on the MG 13, but the MG 13 magazine and &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; were not interchangeable. After the MG 34 redesign, that enabled the MG 34 to use belted ammunition, the &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; became a rare alternative feed option. The &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; could be used only together with a &quot;Trommelhalter&quot; magazine holder that substituted the normal feed cover, thereby switching the gun from belt feeding to &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; &quot;double drum&quot; magazine feeding. It contained 75 loose rounds in two spring-powered spirals twisting in opposite direction, feeding the chamber from opposite sides in turn. The &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; was rather complicated and inconvenient to (re)load, adjust to work reliably, and in use. It had to be loaded by a special &quot;Trommelfüller 34&quot; drum filler machine. This drum filler machine could be stored and carried in a &quot;Patronenkasten 34&quot; ammunition box. An MG 34 configured to use the 75-round magazine could not be returned to belt-feed mode without substituting the &quot;Trommelhalter&quot; magazine holder for the normal feed cover. By the end of 1938 the &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; and its accessories were officially withdrawn. This induced that &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; use by infantry had ceased by 1941, with some mainly in the low level anti-aircraft role remaining in use on armoured vehicles. The MG 34 tended to fire at a somewhat higher cyclic rate when fed by a 75-round &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; than when fed by a standard belt, due to the spring loading of the former.

===Barrel===
The barrel of the MG 34 could be quickly changed to avoid overheating during sustained fire by the machine gun crew and weighed . The service life of an MG 34 barrel was about 6,000 rounds assuming the barrel was used according to the regulations, which prohibited rapid or sustained fire beyond 250 rounds. In cases of emergency the rapid rate of a barrel was limited to 400 rounds. During a barrel change, the operator would disengage a latch on the left side of the receiver which held the receiver to the barrel sleeve. The entire receiver section could then pivot off to the right on its latitudinal axis, allowing the operator to pull the (hot) barrel out the back of the sleeve. A new cool(er) barrel would then be put in the back of the sleeve, and the receiver rotated back in line with the barrel sleeve and latched. The machine gun crew member responsible for a hot barrel change was issued protective asbestos mitts to prevent burns to the hands. The entire process took 10 to 15 seconds when performed by a well-trained crew, causing minimal downtime in battle.

For carrying and protecting spare barrel units, consisting of a barrel and its locking piece, a &quot;Laufschützer 34&quot; (barrel protector) was used as a field accessory. When closed the &quot;Laufschützer 34&quot; looked like a tubular container with mountings at its ends to attach a carrying/shoulder strap. During a barrel change a cool MG 34 barrel unit coming out of the &quot;Laufschützer 34&quot; can be inserted in the machine gun and the replaced hot barrel unit can be placed in or on the opened &quot;Laufschützer 34&quot; to cool down. Later in the war the universal &quot;Laufschützer 43&quot; was introduced that could be used with MG 43 and MG 42 barrel units.

===Trigger===
A notable feature of the MG 34 was its double-crescent trigger, which provided select fire capability without the need for a fire mode selector switch. Pressing the upper segment of the trigger produced semi-automatic fire, while holding the lower segment of the trigger produced fully automatic fire. Though considered innovative at the time, the feature was eliminated due to its complexity on the MG 34&#x27;s successor, the MG 42. The lower section has a restrictor built in the trigger allowing it to be pulled further back if pressed by the user. The safety switch has a secure double safety requiring the user to push in the notch and sliding over until it locks in place in safe/fire modes. Trigger groups on examples used on the eastern front used aluminium grip panels as bakelite tended to crack in the cold.

In the light machine gun role, it was used with a bipod and weighed only . In the medium machine gun role, it could be mounted on one of two tripods, a smaller one weighing , the larger &quot;Lafette 34&quot; .

===&quot;Lafette 34&quot; tripod===
For the medium machine gun role a larger tripod, the MG 34 &quot;Lafette 34&quot;, included a number of features, such as recoil absorbing buffer springs, a &quot;Zielfernrohrhalter&quot; (optical sight mounting bracket) for mounting an MG Z 34 or MG Z 40 periscope-type 4× power telescopic sight containing special sighting equipment for indirect fire or the late World War II MG Z 44, designed for direct fire only. Fitting such an optical sight enabled the machine gun to deliver direct fire out to . An accessory to lengthen these sights&#x27; periscope was available, allowing the use of them behind cover. The &quot;Lafette&quot; could be set up in a prone, kneeling or a high position and weighed on its own. The legs could be extended with a &quot;Lafetteaufsatzstück&quot; to allow it to be used in the low level anti-aircraft role, and when lowered, it could be placed to allow the gun to be fired &quot;remotely&quot; while it swept an arc in front of the mounting with fire. Mounted to the &quot;Lafette&quot; and aimed through the MG Z 34 or MG Z 40 telescopic sight the effective range of the MG 34 could be extended out to when fired indirectly. The indirect firing method exploits the &quot;s.S. Patrone&quot; useful maximum range, that is defined by the maximum range of a small-arms projectile while still maintaining the minimum kinetic energy required to put unprotected personnel out of action, which is generally believed to be 15 kilogram-meters (147 J / 108 ft⋅lbf). The &quot;Lafette 34&quot; tripod also had a bolt box to store a (spare) bolt.

Another unique feature of German World War II machine guns was the &quot;Tiefenfeuerautomat&quot; feature on the &quot;Lafette 34&quot; tripod. If selected, this feature mechanically controlled the rise and fall of the gun, elevating the gun for five rounds and then depressing it for four rounds. It lengthened the beaten zone by walking the fire in wave like motions up and down the range in a predefined area. The length of the beaten zone could be set on the &quot;Tiefenfeuerautomat&quot;. E.g., being unsure whether the real distance was , the gunner could make the mount do an automatic sweep between the elevations for and back. This sweeping of a selected beaten zone continued as long as the gun fired. The &quot;Lafette 34&quot; had a &quot;Richt- und Überschießtafel&quot; (Overhead firing table) riveted to the rear body of the searchfire mechanism from the very start of production until the very end of it. In the later stages of World War II ballistic correction directions were added for overshooting friendly forces with S.m.E. – &quot;Spitzgeschoß mit Eisenkern&quot; (spitzer with iron core) ammunition of which the external ballistic behaviour started to significantly deviate from upwards compared to the &quot;s.S. Patrone&quot; (s.S. ball cartridge). A trigger handle, which enabled the operator to fire the gun without affecting the stability of the gun&#x27;s point of aim, was attached to the &quot;Tiefenfeuerautomat&quot; searchfire unit. On the &quot;Lafette 34&quot; it could be adjusted for both semi-automatic firing and full-automatic firing mode, although some simplified late-war mounts had the trigger configured for full-automatic firing mode only.

There were numerous other specialist mounts for the MG 34. The &quot;Dreibein 34&quot;, for example, was a simple high-standing tripod for mounting the gun in anti-aircraft mode. There were also mounts for bicycles, motorcycle sidecars, tanks and armoured vehicles (ball and pintle mounts), fortress positions, boat decks and even assault gliders. MG 34s were mounted in multiple-gun arrangements, particularly on vehicles, for low level anti-aircraft defence.

The MG 34 butt-stock could be easily removed to reduce the space occupied when mounted inside a vehicle. It was produced in various wood and bakelite versions.

==Variants==

===MG 34 based improvement attempts===
As the first war experiences in the beginning of World War II proved that a higher cyclic fire rate generates more dispersion of the bullets, MG 34 based prototype guns like the MG 34S were requested. The MG 34S had a shortened and lightened barrel, a stiffer multi strands recoil spring and a better recoil booster to increase the rate of fire. The prototype weapons were developed into the very similar further improved MG 34/41, that could cope with a cyclic firing rate of 1,200 rounds per minute, but its components became highly stressed. The effort to simplify the basic MG 34 and reduce production effort and costs consisted mainly of discarding the possibility of semi-automatic fire, using a trigger group containing many stamped parts, and eliminating some complex machining operations during production. Technically, the ejector assembly was enlarged and strengthened, and the feed mechanism was modified to provide a more secure grip on the cartridge. The weight of the MG 34/41 was 14 kg, slightly more than the original MG 34 version. A limited run of MG 34/41 model guns, was completed and tested in combat trials at the Russian front. These guns exhibited durability problems, which is why the development of MG 34 based incrementally improved guns was discontinued. Instead, the German military preferred the technically fundamentally differing also combat trailed MG 39/41 gun. In early 1942 a further improved model of the MG 39/41 was officially accepted and designated as the MG 42.

===MG 34 Panzerlauf===
Most German tanks and other armoured vehicles used during World War II used the MG 34 Panzerlauf or MG 34 Panzermantel for secondary armament, the Jagdpanzer IV tank destroyer being the exception. The MG 42 was ill-suited for enclosed secondary or coaxial mounting due to the method of barrel change. The MG 42&#x27;s barrel had to be removed and replaced by sliding the barrel out at an angle such that, when mounted on a tank/armoured vehicle, armour and space would have to be compromised to fit the weapon. Although the MG 34 was older than the (arguably) improved MG 42, its barrel could be swapped in-line with the gun, meaning that the MG 34 was favoured because it was simpler to design mountings for the gun. The MG 34 was also more versatile to feed, for instance using a 75-round &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; double drum magazine or being select-fire.

The main difference of the &quot;MG 34 Panzerlauf&quot; and the regular MG 34 was the heavier, almost solid &quot;Panzermantel&quot; armored barrel shroud, almost completely lacking the ventilation holes of the regular MG 34. Further the &quot;MG 34 Panzerlauf&quot; featured bipod clamps for attaching a bipod and lacked the anti-aircraft sight bracket. When mounted inside the generally limited space inside an armored vehicle, the MG 34 user detachable butt-stock was taken off. A kit for quick conversion to ground use in the light machine gun role was carried inside the tank containing a butt-stock and a combined bipod and front sight assembly. About 50,000 &quot;MG 34 Panzerlauf&quot; or &quot;MG 34 Panzermantel&quot; were produced.

===MG 81===
The MG 34 was also used as the basis of a new aircraft-mounted machine gun, the MG 81 machine gun. For this role, the breech was slightly modified to allow feeds from either side, and in one version, two guns were bolted together on a single trigger to form a weapon known as the MG 81Z (for &quot;Zwilling&quot;, German for &quot;twin&quot; as in twin-mounted). Production of the MG 34 was never enough to satisfy any of its users, and while the MG81 was a significant improvement over the earlier MG 30-based MG 15 and MG 17 guns, these guns were used until the end of the war. As the Luftwaffe lost the battle for air superiority and declined in priority in the German war effort, MG 15s and MG 81s, which were designed as flexibly mounted aircraft machine guns, were modified and adapted for ground use by infantry, with varying degrees of success.

===MG34F1 and MG34F2===
Norway used and first converted the MG 34 in the 1950s to .30-06 Springfield designated as the MG34F1 and later to 7.62×51mm NATO designated as the MG34F2. These converted MG 34&#x27;s were used by the &quot;Heimevernet&quot; (Norwegian Home Guard) until the mid 1990s.

===TNW MG34===
The TNW MG34 is a closed bolt, semi automatic only version of the MG34 made by TNW firearms, marketed towards civilian collectors, and was manufactured due to the high cost and rarity of the full auto versions. Although they stopped production in 2018, they continue to make part kits for the semi automatic variant of the MG34.

<text>The Battle of the Spurs or (Second) Battle of Guinegate took place on 16 August 1513. It formed a part of the War of the League of Cambrai of 1508 to 1516, during the Italian Wars. King Henry VIII of England and Emperor Maximilian I were besieging the French town of Thérouanne in Artois (now Pas-de-Calais). Henry&#x27;s camp was at Guinegate (present-day Enguinegatte). A large body of French heavy cavalry under Jacques de La Palice was covering an attempt by light cavalry to bring supplies to the besieged garrison. English and Imperial troops surprised and routed the French cavalry. The battle resulted in the precipitate flight and extensive pursuit of the French. During the pursuit, a number of notable French leaders and knights were captured. After the fall of Thérouanne, Henry VIII besieged and took Tournai.

==Prelude==

===Context===
Henry VIII joined the Holy League, as the League of Cambrai was also known, on 13 October 1511 with Venice and Spain to defend the Papacy from its enemies and France with military force. Henry promised to attack France at Guyenne, landing 10,000 men at Hondarribia in the Basque Country in June 1512. This army was conveyed by the admiral Edward Howard, and commanded by Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. It remained at Bayonne till October supporting Ferdinand II of Aragon&#x27;s action in the Kingdom of Navarre, though undersupplied and in poor morale. Maximilian joined the league in November. Louis XII of France hoped that Scotland would aid France against England.

===Siege of Thérouanne===
In May 1513 English soldiers began to arrive in number at Calais to join an army commanded by George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord Steward of the Household. Shrewsbury was appointed Lieutenant-General on 12 May, John Hopton commanded the troop ships. On 17 May Henry announced to the Cinque Ports and Edward Poynings, Constable of Dover Castle, that he would join the invasion in person, and had appointed commissioners to requisition all shipping. In Henry&#x27;s absence across the sea (&quot;ad partes transmarinas&quot;), Catherine of Aragon would rule England and Wales as Rector and Governor (&quot;Rectrix et Gubernatrix&quot;).

The &quot;Chronicle of Calais&quot; recorded the names and arrivals of Henry&#x27;s aristocratic military entourage from 6 June onwards. At the end of the month the army set out for Thérouanne. Shrewsbury commanded the vanguard of 8,000, and Charles Somerset, Lord Herbert the rearward of 6,000. Henry VIII sailed from Dover, and arrived at Calais on 30 June, with the main grouping of 11,000 men. The army was provided by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey as Almoner, and comprised several different types of martial forces including cavalry, artillery, infantry, and longbowmen using arrows with hardened steel heads, designed to penetrate armour more effectively. Eight hundred German mercenaries marched in front of Henry.

Shrewsbury set up a battery and dug mines towards the town&#x27;s walls, but made little progress against the defending garrison of French and German soldiers in July. The town was held for France by Antoine de Créquy, sieur de Pont-Remy who returned fire until the town surrendered, and the English called one distinctive regular cannon shot the &quot;whistle.&quot; Reports of setbacks and inefficiency reached Venice. On the way to Thérouanne two English cannon called &quot;John the Evangelist&quot; and the &quot;Red Gun&quot; had been abandoned, and French skirmishing hampered their recovery with loss of life. Edward Hall, the chronicle author, mentions the role of Henry Bourchier, Earl of Essex in this operation and the advice given by Rhys ap Thomas. An Imperial agent of Margaret of Savoy wrote that two &quot;obstinate men&quot; govern everything, these were Charles Brandon, Viscount Lisle who he called the &quot;Grand Esquire&quot; and the Almoner Wolsey.
Henry camped to the east of Thérouanne at a heavily defended position, described by English chronicles as environed with artillery, such as &quot;falcons, serpentines, cast hagbushes, &quot;tryde harowes&quot;, and spine trestles (bolt firing &quot;tarasnice&quot;)&quot;, with Henry&#x27;s field accommodation consisting of a wooden cabin with an iron chimney, with large tents of blue water-work, yellow, and white fabric, topped by the King&#x27;s beasts, the Lion, Dragon, Greyhound, Antelope, and Dun Cow.

The Emperor Maximilian came to Aire-sur-la-Lys in August, with a small force (either a small escort that cannot be called an army or about 1,000 to 4,000 horsemen, depending on the sources). Henry donned light armour and dressed his entourage in cloth-of gold and came to Aire on 11 August, where Maximilian&#x27;s followers were still dressed in black in mourning for his wife Bianca Maria Sforza. Henry hosted Maximilian at a tent with a gallery of cloth-of-gold at his camp over the weekend beginning 13 August. According to the chronicles, the weather on the day of the meeting was the &quot;foulest ever.&quot; News of Henry&#x27;s meeting with Maximilian in person delighted Catherine of Aragon, who wrote to Wolsey that it was an honour for Henry and would raise Maximilian&#x27;s reputation; he would be &quot;taken for a nother man that he was befor thought&quot;.

Louis XII of France determined to break the siege. In July a force of 800 Albanians commanded by Captain Fonterailles pushed through the besieger&#x27;s lines and successfully delivered gunpowder and supplies including bacon to the gates of the town, leaving 80 soldiers as reinforcements. Fonterailles was helped by covering artillery fire from the town. Reports sent to Venice mentioned 300 English casualties or more, and Fonterailles&#x27; statement that the town could hold out till the feast day of the Nativity of the Virgin, on 8 September. The Venetians were aware that their French sources might have been misrepresenting the situation to gain their support.

==Battle==

===French attempt to supply Thérouanne===

A second French attempt was organized for 16 August, with a force assembled at Blangy to the south. This French army was made up of companies of gendarmes and pikemen, with some other troops as well. These included a type of French light cavalry called &quot;stradiotes&quot; (stradiots), equipped with short stirrups, beaver hats, light lances, and Turkish swords. These may have been Albanian units.

In response to the new threat, English military engineers had built five bridges overnight over the river Lys to allow their army free passage to the other side and Henry moved his camp to Guinegate (now called &quot;Enguinegatte&quot;), on 14 August, after displacing a company of French horse armed with spears who were stationed at the Tower of Guinegate.

The French infantry were left at Blangy, while the heavy cavalry were divided into two companies, one under the command of La Palice and Louis, Duke of Longueville, the other under Charles IV, Duke of Alençon. Alençon&#x27;s smaller force attacked the besieging positions commanded by Lord Shrewsbury, the larger force against the south of the besieging lines where Lord Herbert commanded. Both attacks were designed to act as diversions in order that the stradiots be able to reach Thérouanne with supplies. Each stradiot had a side of bacon at his saddlebow and a sack of gunpowder behind him.

===Combat===

The French had hoped to catch the besieging army unprepared by moving out before dawn; however, the English &#x27;border prickers&#x27; (light cavalry from the Scottish borders) were out and they detected the movement of the larger of the two bodies of French cavalry. Henry VIII drew up a field force from the siege lines sending out a vanguard of 1,100 cavalry, following this with 10,000–12,000 infantry. La Palice&#x27;s force encountered English scouts at the village of Bomy, 5 miles from Thérouanne; the French, realising that the English were alert, checked themselves on the edge of a hillside. The stradiots then began their rather forlorn attempt to contact the garrison, riding in a wide arc towards the town.
Historical accounts derived from English and Imperial sources differ slightly.

According to Sir Charles Oman, whose narrative is largely based on the mid-16th century English &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Edward Hall, La Palice made a mistake in staying in his exposed position too long, presumably he was doing so in order to allow the stradiots the greatest possibility of success. The English heavy cavalry of the vanguard drew up opposite Palice&#x27;s front, while the mounted archers dismounted and shot at the French from a flanking hedgerow. Now aware of the approach of the English infantry in overwhelming numbers, La Palice tardily ordered his force to retreat. At this point the Clarenceux Herald is said to have urged the Earl of Essex to charge. The English men-at-arms and other heavy cavalry charged just as the French were moving off, throwing them into disorder. To complete the French disarray, the stradiots crashed in confusion into the flank of the French heavy cavalry, having been driven off from approaching the town by cannon fire. At much the same time, a body of Imperial cavalry also arrived to menace the other flank of the French horsemen. Panic now seized the French cavalry, whose retreat became a rout. La Palice tried to rally them but to no effect. In order to flee more quickly the French gendarmes threw away their lances and standards, some even cut away the heavy armour of their horses. The chase went on for many miles until the French reached their infantry at Blangy. During the pursuit many notable French knights were captured, along with a royal duke and the French commander, La Palice, himself. Meanwhile, the smaller French force had been driven off, Sir Rhys ap Thomas capturing four of their standards. The initial cavalry clash took place between the village of Bomy and Henry&#x27;s camp at Guinegate.
According to Reinhold Pauli and others, Maximilian recommended that parts of the troops should be sent to the flank and rear of the enemy and lighter cannons should be put on the ridge of the neighbouring hill. He then commanded 2,000 vanguard cavalry troops himself. Marchal reports that the emperor had prepared the battle plan in mind even before arriving at the English headquarters. Henry had wanted to lead the cavalry charge but was advised against this by his allies; so the task fell upon the 53-year-old emperor (he had won two battles in the same area, including the First Guinegate where he was a young leader supported by veterans), who in battle acted as commander-in-chief of the allied forces and directed the military operations in person. He charged with the cavalry against the French as soon as contact was made. The French cavalry initially charged back strongly, but quickly gave way and retreated. According to Howitt, the French retreat was intended as a distraction that would allow Duke of Alençon to provide the city with supplies (but the Duke was repelled by Lord Herbert before reaching the gates of the city), but soon turned into a disastrous flight that the French commanders could not control.

===Contemporary accounts===
The day was soon called the &quot;Battle of the Spurs&quot; (in French: &quot;La Journée d&#x27;Esperons&quot;) because of the haste of the French horse to leave the battlefield. In the summer of 1518 the English ambassador in Spain, Lord Berners, joked that the French had learned to ride fast at the &quot;jurney of Spurres.&quot;

The same evening the Imperial Master of the Posts, Baptiste de Tassis sent news of the battle to Margaret of Savoy from Aire-sur-la-Lys in Artois; Early in the day the Emperor and the King of England encountered 8,000 French horse; the Emperor, with 2,000 only, kept them at bay until four in the afternoon, when they were put to flight. A hundred men of arms were left upon the field, and more than a hundred taken prisoners, of the best men in France; as the Sieur de Piennes, the Marquis de Rotelin, and others. Henry sent his account to Margaret of Savoy on the following day. He mentioned that the French cavalry had first attacked Shrewsbury&#x27;s position blockading the town, capturing 44 men and wounding 22. An Imperial cavalry manoeuvre brought the French horse within range of the guns, and the French cavalry fled.

The chronicle writer Edward Hall gave a somewhat different account. Hall, who says the French called it the &quot;battle of the Spurs&quot;, centres the action around a hill, with English archers at the village of &quot;Bomye.&quot; He has the French cavalry break after a show of English banners organized by the Clarenceux Herald, Thomas Benolt. Hall mentions that Maximilian advised Henry to deploy some artillery on another hill &quot;for out-scourers&quot; but does not mention any effect on the outcome. Although Henry wished to ride into the battle, he stayed with the Emperor&#x27;s foot soldiers on the advice of his council.

After a three-mile chase, amongst the French prisoners were Jacques de la Palice, Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard and Louis d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville. Although reports mention the Emperor&#x27;s decision for his troops to serve under Henry&#x27;s standard, Hall&#x27;s account suggests friction between the English and Imperial forces, during the day and over prisoners taken by the Empire, who were &quot;not brought to sight&quot; and released. Henry returned to his camp at Enguinegatte and heard reports of the day&#x27;s actions. During the fighting the garrison of Thérouanne had come out and attacked Herbert&#x27;s position. According to the report, three English soldiers of note were killed, with 3,000 French casualties. Nine French standards were captured, with 21 noble prisoners dressed in cloth-of-gold.

==Aftermath==

===Fall of Thérouanne===
On 20 August, now unthreatened by French counter-attacks, Henry moved his camp from Guinegate to the south of the town. Thérouanne fell on 22 August, according to diplomatic reports the garrison were initially unimpressed by a show of captured colours, but the French and German garrison were drawn into negotiation with Shrewsbury by their lack of supplies. Shrewsbury welcomed Henry to the town and gave him the keys. Eight or nine hundred soldiers were set to work demolishing the walls of the town and three large bastions which were pushed into the deep defensive ditches. The dry ditches contained deeper pits which were designed for fires to create smoke to choke assailants. The Milanese ambassador to Maximilian, Paolo Da Laude, heard that it was planned to burn the town after demolition was completed. On 5 September Pope Leo X was told of the English victories by the Florentine ambassador and his congratulations were conveyed to Cardinal Wolsey.

===Siege of Tournai===

While demolition continued at Thérouanne, after discussions on 4 September, allied attention moved to Tournai, though Henry would have preferred an attack on Boulogne. Maximilian and Henry went to St Pol, St Venan, Neve and Béthune, and on 10 September Henry entered Lille with great ceremony where Margaret of Savoy held court. That evening, Henry played on the lute, harp, lyre, flute, and horn, and danced with &quot;Madame the Bastard&quot; till nearly dawn, &quot;like a stag&quot;, according to the Milanese ambassador. The same day the army began the siege of Tournai, and Maximilian and Henry visited on 13 September.

At this time Henry VIII was troubled by Scottish preparations for the invasion of England in support of France and had exchanged angry words with a Scottish herald at Thérouanne on 11 August. The Scots army was defeated at the battle of Flodden on 9 September. Before Tournai fell Catherine of Aragon sent John Glyn to Henry with the blood-stained coat and gauntlets of James IV of Scotland. Catherine suggested Henry should use the coat as his battle-banner, and wrote that she had thought to send him the body too, but &quot;Englishmen&#x27;s hearts would not suffer it.&quot; It was suggested that James&#x27; body would be her exchange with Henry for his French prisoner, the Duke of Longueville. Longueville had been captured at Thérouanne by John Clerke of North Weston, sent to Catherine, and lodged in the Tower of London. The idea of an exchange was reported to Alfonso d&#x27;Este Duke of Ferrara in Italy, that Catherine had promised, as Henry &quot;sent her a captive duke, she should soon send him a king&quot;.

Tournai fell to Henry VIII on 23 September. The defenders of Tournai had demolished houses in front of their gates on 11 September, and burnt their suburbs on 13 September. On 15 September the wives and children of the townspeople were ordered to repair damage to the walls caused by the besieger&#x27;s cannon. On the same day the town council proposed a vote on whether the town should declare for France or the Empire. The vote was suspended (&quot;mis en surseance&quot;) and the people appointed deputies to treat with Henry VIII. Charles Brandon captured one of the gatehouses and took away two of its statues as trophies, and the garrison negotiated with Henry and Richard Foxe, Bishop of Winchester, on 20 September. The events within the town were misunderstood in English chronicles, Raphael Holinshed and Richard Grafton wrote that a disaffected &quot;vaunt-parler&quot; had set fire to the suburbs to hasten their surrender, while the Provost canvassed the townspeople&#x27;s opinion.

Henry attended mass in Tournai Cathedral on 2 October and knighted many of his captains. The town presented Margaret of Austria with a set of tapestries woven with scenes from the &quot;Book of the City of Ladies&quot; by Christine de Pizan. Tournai remained in English hands, with William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy as Governor. The fortifications and a new citadel were reconstructed between August 1515 and January 1518, costing around £40,000. Work ceased because Henry VIII planned to restore the town to France. Tournai was returned by treaty on 4 October 1518. The surveyor of Berwick, Thomas Pawne, could not find a market for the unused building materials there, and sent stones by boat via Antwerp to Calais, some carved with English insignia, along with the machinery of two watermills. The construction work at Tournai has been characterized as retrogressive, lacking the input of a professional military engineer, and an &quot;essentially medieval&quot; conception out of step with Italian innovations.

===Propaganda===

Henry and Maximilian jointly published an account of their victories, under the title; &quot;Copia von der erlichen und kostlichen enpfahung ouch früntliche erbietung desz Küngs von Engelland Keyser Maximilian in Bickardy&quot; (Picardy) &quot;gethon, Unnd von dem angryff und nyderlegung do selbs vor Terbona&quot; (Thérouanne) &quot;geschähen. Ouch was un wy vyl volck do gewäsen, erschlagen, und gefangen. Ouch die Belägerung der stat Bornay&quot; (sic: Tournai) &quot;und ander seltzam geschichten&quot;, (1513), which can be translated as; &quot;Of the honourable and sumptuous reception and friendly courtesy shown by the King of England to the Emperor Maximilian in Picardy; and of the attack and defeat which took place there before Thérouanne. Also what and how many people there were slain and captured. Also the siege of the town of Tournay and other strange histories.&quot;The book contains a woodcut of their meeting and one of Maximilian in battle. The battle at Guinegate was described in this manner;About twelve o&#x27;clock the French in three divisions appeared upon another hill (for here and there are little hills and valleys); and as soon as the Emperor knew it he got up and sent for the German horsemen, numbering scarcely 1,050, and the Burgundians, about 1,000 (or 2,000), and commanded to muster the troops and to keep the Germans by him. The French united in one division amounting to 10,000 (or 7,000) cavalry in array and fired guns at the Emperor&#x27;s horsemen, but all went too high and did no hurt. Thus the Burgundians and certain English struck [them], and as they turned and the Emperor saw the Burgundians hard pressed, he at once ordered the German horsemen to attack on the flank; but before they struck the French had turned about and fled. Our horsemen pursued them until within a short mile of their camp and brought back the prisoners and banners hereafter indicated. When the Emperor saw that no more harm could be done them, and they were near their camp wherein were yet 20,000 foot, he retired all the men in good order and marched to the camp, remaining all night in the field. In this skirmish the English used no other cry than Burgundia.

An Italian poem, &quot;La Rotta de Francciosi a Terroana&quot; on the fall of Therouanne was printed in Rome in September 1513. Maximilian also commissioned woodcut images of his meeting with Henry from Leonhard Beck, and from Albrecht Dürer who included a scene of the mounted rulers joining hands in the &quot;Triumphal Arch&quot;. Henry commissioned commemorative paintings of the meeting and of the battle which showed him involved in the centre of the action, though Hall pointed out he took advice to stay with the foot soldiers. In Henry&#x27;s inventory, one painting was noted as &quot;A Table wherein is conteined the Seginge of Torney and Turwyn&quot;. A painting made by &quot;Master Hans&quot;, perhaps Hans Holbein in 1527 for a banqueting house at Greenwich Palace showed the siege of Therouanne with the &quot;very manner of every man&#x27;s camp&quot;. Henry VIII insisted that his guests, the French ambassadors, should turn to look at the picture.

Maximilian&#x27;s tomb at the Hofkirche, Innsbruck, constructed in 1553 to designs by Florian Abel includes a marble relief of the meeting by Alexander Colyn following Dürer&#x27;s woodcut. In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Maximilian objected to the use of his name in the battle report (even before that, he adopted the red rose and the Cross of Saint George, and declared that he would serve as Henry&#x27;s soldier, to avoid the complaint that his force was too small in comparison with his position and his promises). According to Patrick Fraser Tytler, Howitt and others, Maximilian had an ulterior motive in his flattering behaviours towards Henry, which was later understood by some historians (such as Comyn) as Maximilian acting like a mercenary soldier, as Henry was the side who footed the bill for the whole campaign. Additionally, Maximilian wanted to destroy the city walls of Tournai (which usually served as a foothold for French intervention and threatened his grandson Charles&#x27;s Burgundian territories). He accomplished this with his counsel and the help of Thomas Wolsey, to whom he promised help in getting the bishopric of Tournai (Wolsey, who turned out to be the biggest winner in the aftermath according to Derek Wilson, did get the bishoprics of both Lincoln and Tournai. Later he relinquished the latter in exchange for a pension of 12,000 livres.). On the other hand, Henry VIII and his queen Catherine did feel genuine gratitude for Maximilian&#x27;s assistance and later sent him the sizeable sum of 100,000 golden florin.

===English knights made at the Battle of Spurs and in Tournai===
The following were made knights banneret after the battle of the Spurs on 16 September 1513, Edward Hall specifically mentioned the knighting of John Peachy, captain of the King&#x27;s horse, as a banneret and John Car who was &quot;sore hurt&quot; as a knight.
* Andrew Wyndsore, Treasurer of the King&#x27;s middle-ward
* Robert Dymoke, Treasurer of the rear-ward
* Randolph Brereton, marshall of the rear-ward
On 2 October 1513, after Henry attended mass at Tournai Cathedral the following were knighted:

With others, and more including Walter Calverley (1483–1536) were knighted at Lille on 13 and 14 October.

<text>Mollerussa () is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Pla d&#x27;Urgell, in the province of Lleida, Catalonia, Spain.
It is 250 metres above sea level. In 2010 it had a population of 14,733.

The town has grown since the 19th century around the Urgel canal, which transports water from the river Segre to the nearby fields. The installation of the irrigation syndicate made the town the administrative headquarters of the region&#x27;s farmers, and from the 20th century onwards, both agriculture and industry developed.

<doc id="239528" wikidata="Q1507913" url="?curid=239528" title="Independent Labour Party">
<text>The Independent Labour Party (ILP) was a British political party of the left, established in 1893 at a conference in Bradford, after local and national dissatisfaction with the Liberals&#x27; apparent reluctance to endorse working-class candidates. A sitting independent MP and prominent union organiser, Keir Hardie, became its first chairman.

The party played a key role in the formation of the Labour Representation Committee, to which ILP members Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald were delegates at its foundation in 1900. The committee was renamed the Labour Party in 1906, and the ILP remained affiliated until 1932. In 1947, the organisation&#x27;s three parliamentary representatives defected to the Labour Party, and the organisation joined Labour as Independent Labour Publications in 1975.

==Organisational history==

===Background===
As the nineteenth century came to a close, working-class representation in political office became a great concern for many Britons. Many who sought the election of working men and their advocates to the Parliament of the United Kingdom saw the Liberal Party as the main vehicle for achieving this aim. As early as 1869, a Labour Representation League had been established to register and mobilise working-class voters on behalf of favoured Liberal candidates.

Many trade unions themselves became concerned with gaining parliamentary representation to advance their legislative aims. From the 1870s a series of working-class candidates financially supported by trade unions were accepted and supported by the Liberal Party. The federation of British unions, the Trades Union Congress (TUC), formed its own electoral committee in 1886 to further advance its electoral goals.

Many socialist intellectuals, particularly those influenced by Christian socialism and similar notions of the ethical need for a restructuring of society, also saw the Liberals as the most obvious means for obtaining working-class representation. Within two years of its foundation in 1884, the gradualist Fabian Society officially committed itself to a policy of permeation of the Liberal Party.

A number of so-called &quot;Lib-Lab&quot; candidates were subsequently elected Members of Parliament by this alliance of trade unions and radical intellectuals working within the Liberal Party.

The idea of working with the middle-class Liberal Party to achieve working-class representation in parliament was not universally accepted, however. Marxist socialists, believing in the inevitability of class struggle between the working class and the capitalist class, rejected the idea of workers making common cause with the petty bourgeois Liberals in exchange for minor, palliative reform legislation. The British orthodox Marxists established their own party, the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), in 1881.

Other socialist intellectuals, despite not sharing the concept of class struggle were nonetheless frustrated with the ideology and institutions of the Liberal Party and the secondary priority which it appeared to give to its working-class candidates. Out of these ideas and activities came a new generation of activists, including Keir Hardie, a Scot who had become convinced of the need for independent labour politics while working as a Gladstonian Liberal and trade union organiser in the Lanarkshire coalfield. Working with SDF members such as Henry Hyde Champion and Tom Mann he was instrumental in the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party in 1888.

In 1890, the United States imposed a tariff on foreign cloth; this led to a general cut in wages throughout the British textile industry. There followed a strike in Bradford, the Manningham Mills strike, which produced as a by-product the Bradford Labour Union, an organisation which sought to function politically independently of either major political party. This initiative was replicated by others in Colne Valley, Halifax, Huddersfield and Salford. Such developments showed that working-class support for separation from the Liberal Party was growing in strength.

Further arguments for the formation of a new party were to be found in Robert Blatchford&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Clarion&quot;, founded in 1891, and in &quot;Workman&#x27;s Times&quot;, edited by Joseph Burgess. The latter collected some 3,500 names of those in favour of creating a party of labour independent from the existing political organisations.

At the 1892 general election, held in July, three working men were elected without support from the Liberals: Keir Hardie in West Ham South, John Burns in Battersea, and Havelock Wilson in Middlesbrough, the last of whom actually faced Liberal opposition. Hardie owed nothing to the Liberal Party for his election, and his critical and confrontational style in Parliament caused him to emerge as a national voice of the labour movement.

===Founding conference===
At a TUC meeting in September 1892, a call was issued for a meeting of advocates of an independent labour organisation. An arrangements committee was established and a conference called for the following January. This conference was chaired by William Henry Drew and was held in Bradford during 14–16 January 1893 at the Bradford Labour Institute, operated by the Labour Church. It proved to be the foundation conference of the Independent Labour Party, and MP Keir Hardie was elected as its first chairman.

About 130 delegates were in attendance at the conference, including, in addition to Hardie, such socialist and labour worthies as Alderman Ben Tillett, author George Bernard Shaw, and Edward Aveling, partner of Karl Marx&#x27;s daughter Eleanor and translator of his &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. Some 91 local branches of the Independent Labour Party were represented, joined by 11 local Fabian Societies, four branches of the Social Democratic Federation, and individual representatives of a number of other socialist and labour groups. German Socialist leader Edward Bernstein was briefly permitted to address the gathering to pass along the best wishes for success from the Social Democratic Party of Germany.

A proposal was made by a Scottish delegate, George Carson, to name the new organisation the &quot;Socialist Labour Party&quot;, but this was defeated by a large margin by a counterproposal reaffirming the name &quot;Independent Labour Party&quot;, moved by the logic that there were large numbers of workers not yet prepared to formally accept the doctrine of socialism who would nonetheless be willing to join and work for an organisation &quot;established for the purpose of obtaining the independent representation of labour&quot;.

Despite the apparent timidity in naming the organisation, the inaugural conference overwhelmingly accepted that the object of the party should be &quot;to secure the collective and communal ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange&quot;. The party&#x27;s programme called for a range of progressive social reforms, including free &quot;unsectarian&quot; education &quot;right up to the universities&quot;, the provision of medical treatment and school feeding programmes for children, housing reform, the establishment of public measures to reduce unemployment and provide aid to the unemployed, a minimum-wage law, welfare programmes for orphans, widows, the elderly, the disabled, and the sick, the abolition of child labour, the abolition of overtime and piecework, and an eight-hour workday.

The keynote address of the foundation conference was delivered by Keir Hardie, who observed that the Labour Party was &quot;not an organisation but rather &#x27;the expression of a great principle,&#x27; since it &#x27;had neither programme nor constitution&quot;. Hardie emphasised the fundamental demand of the new organisation as being the achievement of economic freedom and called for a party structure which gave full autonomy to every locality, and only seeking to bind these groups &quot;to such central and general principles as were indispensable to the progress of the movement&quot;.

The conference also established the basic organisational structure of the new party. Annual Conferences, composed of delegates from each local unit of the organisation, were declared the &quot;supreme and governing authority of the party&quot;. A Secretary was to be elected, to serve under the direct control of a central body known as the National Administrative Committee (NAC). This NAC was in turn to be made up of regionally appointed delegates who were in theory confined to act according to the instructions given them by branch conferences.

===Early years===
The new party was founded in a social environment of great hope and expectation. However, the first few years were difficult. The direction of the party, its leadership and organisation were heavily contested and the expected electoral progress did not emerge.

The party did not fare well in its first major test of national support, the 1895 general election. With the NAC taking a lead in organising the party&#x27;s contests, and with finance tight just 28 candidates ran under the ILP banner. A special conference decided that support could be given to either ILP or SDF candidates, which brought a further four contests into the picture. None was elected, however, with even the popular party leader Keir Hardie going to defeat in a straight fight with the Conservatives. The electoral debacle of 1895 marked an end to the unbridled optimism which had attended the party&#x27;s foundation.

From its beginning, the ILP was never a homogeneous unit, but rather attempted to act as a &quot;big tent&quot; party of the working class, advocating a rather vague and amorphous socialist agenda. Historian Robert E. Dowse has observed:
&quot;From the beginning the ILP attempted to influence the trade unions to back a working-class political party: they sought, as Henry Pelling states: &#x27;collaboration with trade unionists with the ultimate object of tapping trade union funds for the attainment of Parliamentary power.&#x27; The socialism of the ILP was ideal for achieving this end; lacking as it did any real theoretical basis it could accommodate practically anything a trade unionist was likely to demand. Fervent and emotional, the socialism of the ILP could accommodate, with only a little strain, temperance reform, Scottish nationalism, Methodism, Marxism, Fabian gradualism, and even a variety of Burkean conservatism. Although the mixture was a curious one, it did have the one overwhelming virtue of excluding nobody on dogmatic grounds, a circumstance, on the left and at the time, which cannot be lightly dismissed.&quot;

In a party of loose and diverse opinions, the essential nature of the organisation and its programme would always remain a matter of debate. Initial decisions about party organisation were rooted in an idea of strict democracy. These arguments did have some impact, as the conference held to set policy prior to the 1895 general election and the abolition of the position of party &quot;President&quot; in 1896 testified to the power of such arguments. Nonetheless, the NAC came to possess considerable power over the party&#x27;s activities, including hegemonistic control over crucial matters such as electoral decisions and relations with other parties. The electoral defeat of 1895 hastened the establishment of centralising and anti-democratic practices of this kind.
In the last years of the 19th century, four figures emerged on the NAC who remained at the centre of the party shaping its direction for the next 20 years. In addition to the beloved party leader Keir Hardie came the Scot Bruce Glasier, elected to the NAC in 1897 and succeeding Hardie as Chairman in 1900; Philip Snowden, an evangelical socialist from the West Riding, and Ramsay MacDonald, whose adhesion to the ILP had been secured in the wake of his disillusionment with the Liberal Party over its rejection of a trade unionist candidate in the 1894 Sheffield Attercliffe by-election. While there were substantial personal tensions between the four, they shared a fundamental view that the party should seek alliance with the unions and rather than an ideology-based socialist unity with the Marxist Social Democratic Federation.

Following the failure of 1895, this leadership became reluctant to overextend the party by running in too many electoral races. By 1898 the decision was formally made to restrict electoral contests to those where a reasonable performance could be expected rather than putting forward as many candidates as possible to maximise exposure for the party and to accumulate a maximum total vote.

The relationship with the trade unions was also problematic. In the 1890s the ILP was lacking in alliances with the trade union organisations. Individual trade unionists could be persuaded to join the party out of a political commitment shaped by their industrial experiences, but connection with top leaderships was lacking.

The ILP played a central role in the formation of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900, and when the Labour Party was formed in 1906, the ILP immediately affiliated to it. This affiliation allowed the ILP to continue to hold its own conferences and devise its own policies, which ILP members were expected to argue for within the Labour Party. In return, the ILP provided a good part of Labour&#x27;s activist base during its early years.

===The party matures===

The emergence and growth of the Labour Party, a federation of trade unions with the socialist intellectuals of the ILP, helped its constituent parts develop and grow. In contrast to the Orthodox Marxism of the SDF and its even more orthodox offshoots like the Socialist Labour Party and the Socialist Party of Great Britain, the ILP had a loose and inspirational flavour that made it relatively more easy to attract newcomers. Victor Grayson recalled a 1906 campaign in the Colne Valley which he was proud to have conducted &quot;like a religious revival,&quot; without reference to specific political problems. Future party chairman Fenner Brockway later recounted the revivalist mood of the gatherings of his local ILP branch gathering in 1907:
&quot;On Sunday nights a meeting was conducted rather on the lines of the Labour Church Movement—we had a small voluntary orchestra, sang Labour songs and the speeches were mostly Socialist evangelism, emotion in denunciation of injustice, visionary in their anticipation of a new society.&quot;

While this inspirational presentation of socialism as a humanitarian necessity made the party accessible as a sort of secular religion or a means for the practical implementation of Christian principles in daily life, it bore with it the great weakness of being non-analytical and thus comparatively shallow. It also offered a political home for some of the women&#x27;s franchise movement in the UK, the Liverpool branch appointing Alice Morrissey as the branch secretary (1907–08) and first female delegate to a regional Labour Representative Committee. As the movement for women&#x27;s suffrage grew, the ILP had engaged with the non-militant suffragists, for example, Mary H. J. Henderson, Parliamentary Secretary for the Scottish Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies, chaired a joint meeting with ILP, with Ethel Snowden as key speaker in Dundee in 1914.

As the historian John Callaghan has noted, in the hands of Hardie, Glasier, Snowden and MacDonald socialism was little more than &quot;a vague protest against injustice.&quot; However, in 1909 the ILP laid the basis for the production of agitational material with the establishment of the National Labour Press.

Still, the relationship between the ILP and the Labour Party was characterised by conflict. Many ILP members viewed the Labour Party as being too timid and moderate in their attempts at social reform, detached as it was from the socialist objective during its first years. Consequently, in 1912 came a split in which many ILP branches and a few leading figures, including Leonard Hall and Russell Smart, chose to amalgamate with the SDF of H. M. Hyndman in 1912 to found the British Socialist Party.

Until 1918, individuals could only join the Labour Party through an affiliated body, the most significant of which were the Fabian Society and the ILP. As a result, particularly from 1914, many individuals – particularly ones formerly active in the Liberal Party – joined the ILP, in order to become active in the Labour Party. While affiliated body membership was not required after 1918, the presence of MacDonald and other leading Labour Party figures in the ILP&#x27;s leadership meant many converts to the Labour Party continued to join through the ILP, a process which continued until about 1925.

===The ILP and the Great War===
On 11 April 1914 the party celebrated its 21st anniversary with a congress in Bradford. The party had grown well in the previous decade, standing with a membership of approximately 30,000. The membership of the party as well as its leadership were pacifist, now as ever, having held from the beginning that war was &quot;sinful&quot;.

The guns of August 1914 shook every left organisation in Britain. As one observer later put it: &quot;Hyndman and Cunningham Graham, Thorne and Clynes had sought peace while it endured, but now that war had come, well, Socialists and Trade Unionists, like other people had got to see it through.&quot; With respect to the Labour Party, most of the members of the organisation&#x27;s executive as well as most of the 40 Labour MPs in Parliament lent their support to the recruiting campaign for the Great War. Only one section held aloof—the Independent Labour Party.

The ILP&#x27;s insistence on standing by its long-held ethically based objections to militarism and war proved costly both in terms of its standing in the eyes of the general public as well as its ability to hold sway over the politicians who ran under its banner. A stream of its old Members of Parliament left the party over the ILP&#x27;s refusal to support the British war effort. Among those breaking ranks were George Nicoll Barnes, J. R. Clynes, James Parker, George Wardle and G. H. Roberts.

Others held true to the party and its principles. Ramsay MacDonald, a committed pacifist, immediately resigned the chairmanship of the Labour Party in the House of Commons. Keir Hardie, Philip Snowden, W. C. Anderson, and a small group of like-minded radical pacifists, maintained an unflinching opposition to the government and its pro-war Labour allies. The 1917 Russian Revolution Conference in Leeds called for &quot;the complete independence of Ireland, India and Egypt&quot;.

During the war the ILP&#x27;s criticism of militarism was somewhat muted by public condemnation and periodic episodes of physical violence, which included a wild scene on 6 July 1918, during which an agitated group of discharged soldiers rushed an ILP meeting being addressed by Ramsay MacDonald in the Abbey Wood section of London. Stewards at the door of the ILP meeting were overpowered by the mob, who in what was described as a &quot;riotous scene&quot; broke chairs and wielded their parts as weapons, seizing the auditorium and dispersing the socialists into the night.

===The ILP and the Third International===
Following the termination of World War I in November 1918, the Second International was effectively relaunched and the question of whether the ILP should affiliate with this renewed Second International or with some other international grouping loomed large. The majority of ILP members saw the old Second International as hopelessly compromised by its support for the European bloodbath of 1914, and the ILP formally disaffiliated from the International in the spring of 1920. In January 1919, Moscow issued a call for the formation of a new Third International, a formation which held great appeal to a small section of the ILP&#x27;s most radical members,
including economist Emile Burns, journalist R. Palme Dutt, and the future Member of Parliament Shapurji Saklatvala, along with Charles Barber, Ernest H. Brown, Helen Crawfurd, C. H. Norman, and J. Wilson. They called themselves the Left Wing Group of the ILP.

The conservative leadership of the ILP, notably Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden, strongly opposed affiliation to the new Comintern. In opposition to them the radical wing of the ILP organised itself as a formal faction called the Left Wing Group of the ILP in an effort to move the ILP into the Communist International. The faction began to produce its own bi-weekly newspaper called &quot;The International&quot;, a four-page broadsheet published in Glasgow, and sent greetings to the conference which established a Communist Party of Great Britain, although they did not attend.

In addition to cutting its ties with the Second International, the 1920 Annual Conference of the ILP directed its executive to contact the Swiss Socialist Party with a view to establishing an all-inclusive international which would join the internationalist left-wing socialist parties with their revolutionary socialist brethren of the new Moscow international. In a letter dated 21 May 1920, ILP chairman Richard Wallhead and National Council member Clifford Allen asked a further set of questions of the Comintern. The Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) was asked for its positions on such matters as demands for rigid adherence to its programme, applicability of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Soviet system to Great Britain, and its view on the necessity of armed force as a universal principle.

In July 1920 the fledgling Comintern gave an unequivocal reply: while the presence of communists inside the organisation was acknowledged, and their membership in a new Communist Party welcomed, there would be no joint organisation with those like &quot;the Fabians, Ramsay MacDonald, and Snowden&quot; who had previously made use of &quot;the musty atmosphere of parliamentary work&quot; and &quot;petty concessions and compromises&quot; on behalf of the labour movement:
[T]hese leaders have lost touch with the wide unskilled masses, with the toiling poor, they have become oblivious of the growth of capitalist exploitation and of the revolutionary aims of the proletariat. It seemed to them that because the capitalists treated them as equals, as partners in their transactions, the working class had secured equal rights with capital. Their own social standing secure and material position improved, they looked upon the world through the rose-coloured spectacles of a peaceful middle-class life. Disturbed in their peaceful trading with the representatives of the bourgeoisie by the revolutionary strivings of the proletariat they were the convinced enemies of the revolutionary aims of the proletariat.

The ECCI instead made its appeal directly to &quot;the communists of the Independent Labour Party&quot;, noting that &quot;the revolutionary forces of England are split up&quot; and urging them to unite with communist members of the British Socialist Party, the Socialist Labour Party, and radical groups in Wales and Scotland. &quot;The emancipation of the British working class and of the working class of the whole world depends upon the Communist elements of England forming a single Communist Party&quot;, the ECCI declared.

The agitation for affiliation to the Third International of Moscow came to a head in 1921 at the annual conference of the ILP. There an overwhelming vote of the party&#x27;s branches voted not to affiliate with the Third International. This decision was followed by the exit of the defeated radical faction, which immediately joined the CPGB.

The &quot;centrism&quot; of the ILP, caught between the reformist politics of the Second International and the revolutionary politics of the Third International, led it to leading a number of other European socialist groups into the &quot;Second and a Half International&quot; between 1921 and 1923. The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1933.

===The ILP and Labour Party governments (1922–1931)===
At the 1922 general election several ILP members became MPs (including future ILP leader James Maxton) and the party grew in stature. The ILP provided many of the new Labour MPs, including John Wheatley, Emanuel Shinwell, Tom Johnston and David Kirkwood. However, the first Labour government, returned to office in 1924, proved to be hugely disappointing to the ILP. This came despite 30% of the cabinet holding ILP membership; of the most prominent of these figures, Ramsay MacDonald was removed as editor of the ILP&#x27;s &quot;Socialist Review&quot; in 1925, and Philip Snowden resigned from the ILP in 1927.

====1928 policy conferences====
The ILP&#x27;s response to the first Labour government was to devise its own programme for government. Throughout 1928, the ILP developed a &quot;Socialism in Our Time&quot; platform, largely formulated by H. N. Brailsford, John A. Hobson and Frank Wise. The programme consisted of eight policies:
# The Living Wage, incompletely applied
# A substantial increase of the Unemployment Allowance
# The nationalisation of banking, incompletely applied
# The bulk purchase of raw materials
# The bulk purchase of foodstuffs
# The nationalisation of power
# The nationalisation of transport
# The nationalisation of land

Of these eight policies, the living wage, the unemployment allowance, nationalisation of banking and the bulk purchase of raw materials and foodstuffs were the chief concern of the ILP. The centerpiece of the ILP program was the &quot;Living Wage&quot; policy, which sought to impose high minimum wages across all industries and nationalize all private enterprises which could not afford to pay them in order to resolve interwar unemployment and poverty, which it held to be caused by underconsumption. Increasing the unemployment allowance and switching to bulk purchasing were to be done in the conventional way, but the method of paying the living wage differed from Labour practices. The ILP criticised the &quot;Continental&quot; method of paying wage allowances from employers&#x27; pools, which had been implemented in 1924 by Rhys Davies. The ILP proposed to redistribute the national income, meeting the cost of the allowances by taxing high income earners.

The nationalisation of banking involved more significant changes to economic policy, and had nothing in common with Labour practices. The ILP proposed that once a Labour government took office it should hold an enquiry into the banking system that would prepare a detailed scheme for transferring the Bank of England to public control, revise the operation of the Bank Acts and ensure that &quot;control of credit is exercised in the national interest and not in the interest of powerful financial groups&quot; by making creditors shift entirely to cheques and possibly getting rid of gold reserves, thus ending the policy of deflation practised by the Treasury and the Bank of England.

The Labour leadership did not support the programme. In particular, MacDonald objected to the slogan &quot;Socialism In Our Time&quot;, as he viewed socialism as a gradual process. For the duration of the second Labour government (1929–31), 37 Labour MPs were sponsored by the ILP, but none were appointed to the cabinet. Instead, the group provided the left opposition to the Labour leadership. The 1930 ILP conference decided that where their policies diverged from the Labour Party their MPs should break the whip to support the ILP policy.

====1931 ILP Scottish Conference====
It was becoming clearer that the ILP was diverging further away from the Labour Party and at the 1931 ILP Scottish Conference the issue of whether the party should still affiliate to Labour was discussed. It was decided to continue to do so, but only after Maxton himself intervened in the debate.

===From disaffiliation to the Second World War===

At the 1931 general election the ILP candidates refused to accept the standing orders of the Parliamentary Labour Party and stood without Labour Party support. Five ILP members were returned to Westminster and created an ILP group outside the Labour Party. The ILP increasingly viewed the Great Depression as the beginning of the collapse of capitalism and saw the mainstream Labour Party as insufficiently committed to socialism. In 1932 a special conference of the ILP voted to disaffiliate from Labour. The same year the ILP co-founded the London Bureau of left-socialist parties, later called the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre or &quot;Three-and-a-Half International&quot;, administered by the ILP and chaired by its leader, Fenner Brockway, for most of its existence.

The Labour left-winger Aneurin Bevan described the ILP&#x27;s disaffiliation as a decision to remain &quot;pure, but impotent&quot;. Outside the Labour Party the ILP went into decline. In just three years it lost 75% of its members, the total falling from 16,773 in 1932 to 4,392 in 1935, as it lost adherents to the Labour Party, the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and the Trotskyists. Some members of the ILP who had chosen to remain within the Labour Party were instrumental in creating the Socialist League, while the majority of Scottish members left to form the Scottish Socialist Party and members in Northern Ireland left &quot;en masse&quot; to form the Socialist Party of Northern Ireland. In 1934 a breakaway group in the Northwest of England left to form the Independent Socialist Party.

The remaining ILP membership tended to be young and radical. They were particularly active in supporting the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, and around twenty-five members and sympathisers, including George Orwell, went to Spain as members of an ILP Contingent of volunteers to assist the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a sister party to the ILP in the Three-and-a-Half International.

From the mid-1930s onwards the ILP also attracted the attention of the Trotskyist movement, and various Trotskyist groups worked within it, notably the Marxist Group, of which C. L. R. James, Denzil Dean Harber and Ted Grant were members. There was also a group of ILP members, the Revolutionary Policy Committee, who were sympathetic to the CPGB and eventually left to join that party. From the late 1930s the ILP had the support of several key figures in the tiny Pan-Africanist movement in Britain, including George Padmore and Chris Braithwaite, as well as left-wing writers such as George Orwell, Reginald Reynolds and Ethel Mannin.

In 1939 the ILP wrote to the Labour Party requesting reaffiliation subject to a right to advocate its own policies where it had a &quot;conscientious objection&quot; to Labour policy. Labour refused to agree to this condition, stating that its usual rules for affiliation could not be waived for the ILP.

===World War II and beyond===
As in 1914, the ILP opposed World War II on ethical grounds, and turned to the left. One aspect of its leftist policies in this period was that it opposed the war-time truce between the major parties and actively contested Parliamentary elections. One such contest, the Cardiff East by-election in 1942, resulted in the bizarre situation that the local Labour and Communist machinery campaigned against ILP candidate Fenner Brockway in favour of a Conservative.

The ILP still had some significant strength at the end of the war, but it went into crisis shortly afterwards. At the 1945 general election it retained three MPs, all in Glasgow, although only one of them had a Labour opponent. Its conference rejected calls to reaffiliate to the Labour Party. A major blow came in 1946 when the party&#x27;s best known public spokesman, James Maxton MP, died. The ILP narrowly held his seat in the 1946 Glasgow Bridgeton by-election (against a Labour opponent). However, all its MPs defected to Labour at various stages in 1947, and the party was roundly defeated at the 1948 Glasgow Camlachie by-election, in a seat it had won easily only three years earlier. The party was never again able to win a significant vote in a parliamentary election.

Despite these blows, the ILP continued. Throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s it pioneered opposition to nuclear weapons and sought to publicise ideas such as workers&#x27; control. It also maintained links with the remnants of its fraternal groups, such as the POUM, who were in exile, as well as campaigning for decolonisation.

In the 1970s, the ILP reassessed its views on the Labour Party, and in 1975 it renamed itself Independent Labour Publications and became a pressure group inside Labour.

<doc id="239532" wikidata="Q224004" url="?curid=239532" title="Topaz (1969 film)">
<text>Topaz is a 1969 American espionage thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and starring Frederick Stafford, Dany Robin, Karin Dor, John Vernon, Claude Jade, Michel Subor, Michel Piccoli, Philippe Noiret and John Forsythe. Based on the 1967 novel of the same title by Leon Uris, the film is about a French intelligence agent (Stafford) who becomes entangled in Cold War politics before the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and then the breakup of an international Soviet spy ring.

The story is loosely based on the 1962 Sapphire Affair, which involved the head of France&#x27;s SDECE in the United States, the spy Philippe Thyraud de Vosjoli, a friend of Uris, who played an important role in &quot;helping the U.S. discover the presence of Russian offensive missiles in Cuba.&quot;

==Plot==
In Copenhagen in 1962, a high-ranking Soviet intelligence officer, Boris Kusenov, defects to the West. During debriefing, CIA agent Mike Nordstrom learns that Soviet missiles with nuclear warheads will be placed in Cuba.

Needing physical evidence, Nordstrom discloses Kusenov&#x27;s name to French agent André Devereaux and asks him to bribe Luis Uribe, a member of Cuba&#x27;s UN delegation, to provide photographs of documents that confirm the missile bases in Cuba. Devereaux decides to accompany his daughter, Michèle, on her honeymoon to New York City with his son-in-law, François Picard. André&#x27;s wife Nicole is worried that André is using the family trip to work for Nordstrom in New York.

In New York City, French agent Philippe Dubois is to contact Uribe, who is the secretary to Cuban official Rico Parra, who is staying at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem to show solidarity with the black community.

Dubois sneaks into the hotel and bribes Uribe to take the documents from Parra&#x27;s office to photograph. Parra catches Dubois photographing the documents. Chased and shot at by Cuban revolutionaries, Dubois purposefully knocks into Devereaux, who is watching events from the other side of the street, and slips him the camera. A red-headed Cuban guard helps Devereaux to get up but lets him go. Dubois escapes into the crowd around the hotel.

Dubois&#x27;s photos confirm that the Soviets are placing missiles in Cuba. Devereaux, despite accusations of infidelity by his wife Nicole, flies to Cuba. His mistress, Juanita de Cordoba (Karin Dor), was the widow of a &quot;hero of the Revolution,&quot; which enables her to work undercover in the resistance. Upon his arrival, Devereaux finds Parra, another of her lovers, leaving Juanita&#x27;s mansion. Devereaux asks Juanita to take photographs of the missiles. Juanita&#x27;s loyal domestic staff, Carlotta and Pablo Mendoza, pose as picnickers and photograph the missiles. Pursued, the two hide the incriminating film before they are captured.

During a mass rally and a lengthy speech by the &quot;líder máximo&quot;, the red-headed Cuban guard recognises Devereaux&#x27;s face from the New York City incident.

Parra has heard from the tortured Carlotta Mendoza that Juanita is their leader. He embraces her and shoots her dead to save her from extreme torture.

At the Havana airport, the Cuban authorities fail to find the microfilms that Deveraux has. He returns to find that Nicole has left him. Devereaux is recalled to Paris. Before he leaves, Kusenov tells him about the existence of a Soviet spy organisation, &quot;Topaz,&quot; within the French intelligence service. He is given the name of NATO official Henri Jarré, who leaked documents to the KGB.

In Paris, André is picked up at the airport by Michèle and François. He accompanies Michèle to a cocktail party at his friend Jacques Granville&#x27;s house. Michèle wants to reconcile her parents, as Nicole has found out about André&#x27;s affair with Juanita. When Michèle asks her mother to help her father, she refuses. At the party, Jacques confesses to a friend that he once liked Nicole, but that she married André. André invites some of his old friends and colleagues, including Granville and Jarré, to a lunch at a fine Paris restaurant under the pretext of helping Devereaux prepare for his inquiry. Devereaux tells the others about Topaz to provoke some reaction. Jarré claims that it is misinformation and that Kusenov died a year ago.

Jarré panics and visits the leader of the spy ring, Jacques Granville. Devereaux, Nicole, and Granville were close friends from their days together during the French Resistance. Granville tells Jarré that it was a mistake to say Kusenov was dead since the Americans will easily discover that Jarré lied. As Jarré leaves Granville&#x27;s house, Nicole arrives to meet Granville, who is her lover. She glimpses Jarré departing.

Devereaux sends his son-in-law, François, to interview Jarré and coax him into admitting something. Before François can succeed, two mysterious men show up. Devereaux and Michèle rush to Jarré&#x27;s flat and find Jarré dead, a staged suicide, and François missing. François returns to Michèle&#x27;s apartment and says he was clubbed and kidnapped, but managed to escape from his captors&#x27; car, after overhearing the phone number of their boss, known as Columbine, the head of Topaz.

Nicole recognizes François&#x27;s sketch of Jarré as the man she saw leaving Granville&#x27;s house, and recognizes the phone number as Granville&#x27;s. She tearfully tells her family that Granville he must be the leader of Topaz. Granville, exposed, commits suicide (in the American and the French versions) or flees to the Soviet Union (in the British version).

===Screenplay===
Shel Talmy and William Piggott Brown first tried to option the film rights to Leon Uris&#x27;s novel for $500,000 in 1967, but the deal was halted by the Bank of England because of the 1967 devaluation of the pound sterling. Alfred Hitchcock first hired Uris to adapt his own novel for the screen five months later. Afterwards Philippe de Vosjoli filed a lawsuit against Uris, Universal Pictures, and MCA Inc claiming that they had stolen the plot for the novel and film from his unpublished manuscript &quot;Le reseau Topaz&quot;. De Vosjoli and Uris settled out of court with a deal that would give Uris full rights to the profits from the film but gave de Vosjoli half of the profits from the novel.

Reportedly, Hitchcock and Uris differed on aspects of character development, with Hitchcock claiming that Uris had not humanised the villains of the story. Uris also did not appreciate Hitchcock&#x27;s insistence on adding black humour. After a portion of the draft had been written, Uris left the film. Hitchcock attempted to hire Arthur Laurents to complete the work on the screenplay, but he refused, leaving an unfinished draft while the shooting schedule was rapidly approaching. Ultimately, Samuel A. Taylor, cowriter of &quot;Vertigo&quot;, was hired, but the film began without a completed screenplay. Some scenes were written only hours before they were filmed.

Hitchcock changed the script shortly before the beginning of filming, and the distributor, Universal, forced an ending that was different from the one that was preferred by Hitchcock. For &quot;Topaz&quot;, Hitchcock engaged the 19-year-old French actress Claude Jade from Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot;. She and Dany Robin, who was cast as her mother, would provide the glamour in the story. &quot;Jade is a rather quiet young lady,&quot; Hitchcock later said, &quot;but I wouldn&#x27;t guarantee [that] about her behaviour in a taxi.&quot;

===Production===
Like his previous films &quot;Rope&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot;, Hitchcock intended the film to be an experiment for whether colours, predominantly red, yellow and white, could be used to reveal and to influence the plot. He later admitted that it did not work out.

Production began on September 25, 1968, and concluded at the beginning of March 1969. Portions of &quot;Topaz&quot; were filmed on location in Copenhagen; Wiesbaden, West Germany; Virginia, Paris, New York City, and Washington, DC. The remainder of the film was shot at Universal Studios Hollywood and in and around Los Angeles.

Prior to Hitchcock&#x27;s decision to hire Maurice Jarre to compose the score, other composers who were interested in offering their services included Michel Legrand, Richard Rodney Bennett, and Ravi Shankar.

===Hitchcock cameo===
Hitchcock&#x27;s signature cameo appearance occurs around 28 minutes into the film. At the airport, he is seated in a wheelchair as he is being pushed by a nurse. She stops, and he nonchalantly stands and greets a man and proceeds to walk off screen with him.

===Alternative versions and endings===
Hitchcock&#x27;s first cut of the film ended with a duel between Devereaux and Granville in a French football stadium. It was shot by associate producer Herbert Coleman when Hitchcock had to return to the United States for a family emergency. Audiences panned the ending during test screenings. They also said the film was far too long.

Under pressure from the studio, Hitchcock shot a second ending that he actually liked better, with Granville escaping on an Aeroflot flight to the Soviet Union as Devereaux and Nicole board their adjacent Pan Am flight back to the United States. However, the ending apparently confused audiences. Also, screenwriter Samuel Taylor objected to the villain escaping unpunished, and there were fears that the ending would offend the French government.

As a compromise, Hitchcock used existing footage to create a third ending in which Granville is exposed and expelled from a NATO meeting. Over a shot of the exterior of his apartment, the sound of a gunshot tells that Granville commits suicide behind his drawn curtains, since no footage of his suicide existed.

The film was released theatrically with this third ending and was also edited down by nearly 20 minutes to a final length of 127 minutes. The &quot;airport ending&quot; briefly appeared on British prints of the film by mistake, but those prints were soon altered to match the version that was released elsewhere.

The 1987 laserdisc contained the 127-minute theatrical cut, along with the first release of the two alternate endings, as bonus features. The 1999 US DVD contained the first release of the extended 143-minute cut of the film, using Hitchcock&#x27;s preferred second ending, in which Granville escapes. All three endings appear as extras on the US DVD, together with an &quot;Appreciation&quot; by Leonard Maltin in which Maltin discusses the deleted scenes and the alternate endings.

The extended cut adds a sequence after Devereaux returns to Paris, in which he is picked up at the airport by his daughter Michèle and his son-in-law François. Michèle brings Devereaux to a cocktail party held by Granville, which Nicole is also attending. Michèle hopes her parents will get along, but Nicole cannot forgive Devereaux&#x27;s affair with Juanita. Devereaux and Michèle stay alone, and Granville complains to the agent Martin that he regrets that Nicole married Devereaux.

The longer 143-minute version of the film has since been released numerous times on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Blu-Ray in the US and the UK. Most other countries worldwide have the shorter theatrical cut on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Topaz&quot; earned $3.8 million in box office rentals from the United States and Canada in 1970.

===Critical reaction===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on his year-end list of the ten best films of 1969 and declared it a &quot;huge success, a quirky, episodic espionage tale made rich and suspenseful, not through conventional Hitchcockian narrative drive, but through odd, perverse Hitchcockian detail, economy of cinematic gesture, and an over-all point of view that can never for a moment be mistaken as belonging to anyone but Hitchcock.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also liked the film and wrote that although there was a &quot;loss of momentum&quot; at the climax because of the time taken to resolve the complex plot, the first three quarters of the film were &quot;bravura displays of the fabled Hitchcock technique, replete with dazzling camera movements and acute imagery.&quot; Thomas singled out the Harlem sequence as among &quot;the best that Hitchcock has ever done.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it &quot;tends to move more solidly and less infectiously than many of the maestro of menace&#x27;s best remembered pix. Yet Hitchcock has brought in a full quota of twists and tingling moments. It is just that the picture seems to move predictably and lacks the fun and surprise blood curdling moments that can lift his thrillers with breathtaking excitement.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; in Britain wrote that the film had &quot;intermittent pleasures (the silent conversation behind hotel doors seen from across the street, the long pull back across the conference room and the reverse track forward ending with a zoom on to Piccoli&#x27;s face), yet we are constantly deprived of the action set pieces which would have given the narrative its much needed boost. It is known that Hitchcock had trouble with the climax (and juggled three different endings); but the one finally chosen for the commercial print here looks as if it could have been devised by anyone.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The film as a whole dies from a lack of humor and animation... The awful truth is that Hitchcock would probably be better off if he retired. The most one can say for his direction of &#x27;Topaz&#x27; is that it&#x27;s polished: The compositions are symmetrical and the photography is glossy. But if this is all it is, the film might as well be the work of a disinterested computer.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;the same damned spy picture he&#x27;s been making since the thirties, and it&#x27;s getting longer, slower, and duller.&quot; John Simon described Topaz as both wretched and senile.
Some American critics complained that there was no Hollywood star in the movie such as Ingrid Bergman or Cary Grant although the cast included the renowned international film stars Claude Jade, Michel Piccoli, and Philippe Noiret, the last of whom had previous successes that had been primarily in France. Some attribute Hitchcock&#x27;s casting choices to his negative experience of working with Paul Newman on &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;, but Hitchcock is said to have approached Sean Connery, who had worked with him in &quot;Marnie&quot;, for André and Catherine Deneuve for his wife. Some critics have inferred that Hitchcock was hoping to groom the relatively unknown Frederick Stafford as a star of his own making, like Tippi Hedren; however, Stafford remained unknown in Hollywood though he had a lengthy career in European films.

In 1969, Hitchcock won the Best Director Award for &quot;Topaz&quot; from the National Board of Review.

&quot;Topaz&quot; had its American network television premiere on &quot;NBC Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; on January 29, 1972. &quot;Topaz&quot; currently holds a 69% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.

<doc id="239536" wikidata="Q657597" url="?curid=239536" title="Convair F-102 Delta Dagger">
<text>The Convair F-102 Delta Dagger is an interceptor aircraft designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Convair. A member of the Century Series, the F-102 was the first operational supersonic interceptor and delta-wing fighter operated by the United States Air Force (USAF).

The F-102 was designed in response to a requirement, known as the &quot;1954 Ultimate Interceptor&quot;, produced by USAF officials during the late 1940s. Its main purpose was to be the backbone of American air defences and to intercept approaching Soviet strategic bomber fleets (primarily the Tupolev Tu-95) during the Cold War. The aircraft was designed alongside a sophisticated fire-control system (FCS); however, a simplified unit had to be adopted due to development difficulties. It used an internal weapons bay to carry both guided missiles and rockets. On 23 October 1953, the prototype YF-102 performed its maiden flight; however, it was destroyed in an accident only nine days later. The second prototype allowed flight testing to resume three months later, but results were disappointing: as originally designed, the aircraft could not achieve Mach 1 supersonic flight.

To improve its performance prior to quantity production commencing, the F-102 was redesigned, its fuselage was reshaped in accordance with the area rule while a thinner and wider wing was also adopted. Flight testing demonstrated sufficient performance improvements for the USAF to be persuaded to permit its production; a new production contract was signed during March 1954. Following its entry to USAF service in 1956, the F-102 promptly replaced various subsonic fighter types, such as the Northrop F-89 Scorpion, in the interceptor role. The &quot;F-102C&quot; tactical attack model, equipped with several improvements, including a more powerful engine and Gatling gun, was proposed but not ultimately pursued. A total of 1,000 F-102s were built, both for the USAF and a handful of export customers, including the Hellenic Air Force and the Turkish Air Force.

By the 1960s, USAF F-102s had participated in a limited capacity in the Vietnam War as a bomber escort and even in the ground-attack role. The aircraft was supplemented by McDonnell F-101 Voodoos and, later on, by McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs. Over time, many F-102s were retrofitted with infrared search/tracking systems, radar warning receivers, transponders, backup artificial horizons, and modified fire-control systems. Throughout the mid-to-late 1960s, many USAF F-102s were transferred from the active duty Air Force to the Air National Guard, and, with the exception of those examples converted to unmanned &quot;QF-102&quot; Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) drones, the type was totally retired from operational service in 1976. Its principal successor in the interceptor role was the Mach 2-capable Convair F-106 Delta Dart, which was an extensive redesign of the F-102.

==Design and development==

===Background===
On 8 October 1948, the board of senior officers of the United States Air Force (USAF) issued recommendations that the service organize a competition for a new interceptor scheduled to enter service in 1954; as such, the all-new design would initially be dubbed the &quot;1954 Ultimate Interceptor&quot;. Four months later, on 4 February 1949, the USAF approved the recommendation and prepared to hold a corresponding competition during the following year. In November 1949, the USAF decided that the new aircraft would be built around a fire-control system (FCS). The FCS was to be designed before the airframe to ensure compatibility. The airframe and FCS together were called the weapon system.

In January 1950, the USAF&#x27;s Air Materiel Command issued request for proposals (RFPs) to 50 companies for the FCS, of which 18 responded. By May, the list was revised downward to 10. Meanwhile, a board at the U.S. Department of Defense headed by Major General Gordon P. Saville reviewed the proposals, and distributed some to the George E. Valley-led Air Defense Engineering Committee. Following recommendations by the committee to the Saville Board, the proposals were further reduced to two competitors, Hughes Aircraft and North American Aviation. Although the Valley Committee thought it was best to award the contract to both companies, Hughes was chosen by Saville and his team on 2 October 1950.

In June 1950, the requirement for the airframe was formally issued; during January 1951, six aircraft manufacturers submitted nine responses. On 2 July 1954, three of the responding companies, Convair, Republic, and Lockheed, were authorised to proceed with the building of a mockup. Upon completion, the three designs would be competitively reviewed, the best of which would lead to the awarding of a single production contract under the name &quot;Project MX-1554&quot;. Prior to this requirement, Convair had performed considerable early research into delta-winged aircraft and had experimented with various different designs, two of which fell under the name &quot;P-92&quot;. For the era, Convair&#x27;s submitted design was relatively unorthodox, not only in terms of the delta wing configuration but the decision to carry all munitions within an internal weapons bay to reduce drag; despite this, Republic&#x27;s design was even more radical, proposing to use ramjet propulsion to attain speeds in excess of Mach 3.

===Selection===
Ultimately, Convair&#x27;s design emerged as the front runner for the requirement, which was officially designated &quot;XF-102&quot;. Lockheed had chosen to drop out to concentrate on other opportunities while Republic&#x27;s design had been judged to involve too much technical risk to meet the 1954 deadline for service entry, thus was disqualified, making Convair the de facto winner. The development of three different designs has been considered to be too expensive to proceed with, thus only Convair was permitted to do so in November 1951. From an early stage, USAF officials had decided to use the Cook-Craigie Plan for the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturing; under this concept, production tooling and facilities would be created while a small pre-production batch of aircraft would be completed, the aim being to eliminate the need for a lengthy prototype program, instead incorporating any changes required into the production line. However, if substantial modifications were necessary, re-tooling would then become necessary as well. In December 1951, in order to accelerate the aircraft&#x27;s development, it was proposed to equip the prototypes and pre-production aircraft with the less-powerful Westinghouse J40 turbojet.

During early 1953, by which point construction of the first aircraft had reached an advanced stage, it had become clear that there were serious design challenges present, including wind tunnel testing that revealed early performance projections to have been overly optimistic. Furthermore, there had been sustained delays to both the Curtiss-Wright J67 engine, a licensed derivative of the Bristol-Siddeley Olympus which was still in development, and the MA-1 (formerly &quot;MX-1179&quot;) FCS; to address the latter, decision makers opted to order an interim aircraft with the J40 and a simpler FCS (initially referred to as &quot;E-9&quot;) into production as the &quot;F-102A&quot;. The failure of the J40 led to the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojet with afterburner, rated with of thrust, being substituted for the prototypes and F-102As. This aircraft was intended to be temporary, pending the development of the more advanced F-102B, which would employ the more advanced J67. The F-102B would later evolve to become the F-106A, dubbed the &quot;Ultimate Interceptor&quot;.

On 23 October 1953, the &quot;YF-102&quot; prototype conducted its first flight from Edwards Air Force Base, piloted by Convair&#x27;s chief test pilot Richard L. Johnson. Its flying career was very brief as it was lost in an accident only nine days later during a failed attempt to reach Mach 1. The accident, which was caused by severe buffeting, seriously injured Johnson. The second aircraft flew on 11 January 1954, confirming a dismal performance. Transonic drag was much higher than expected, and the aircraft was limited to Mach 0.98 (i.e. subsonic), with a ceiling of 48,000 ft (14,630 m), far below the requirements.

===Major redesign===
During mid 1953, Convair concluded that it needed to take action to address the F-102&#x27;s shortcomings to prevent its cancellation, and promptly embarked on a major redesign effort. It was decided to incorporate the recently discovered area rule, the application of which simultaneously simplified both production and maintenance of the aircraft. This redesign entailed the lengthening of the fuselage by 11 ft (3.35 m), being &quot;pinched&quot; at the midsection (dubbed the &quot;Coke Bottle configuration&quot;), with two large fairings on either side of the engine nozzle, with revised intakes and a new, narrower canopy. A more powerful model of the J57 was installed while the aircraft structure was also lightened.

In parallel to this effort, the wing was also redesigned to be both thinner and wider. The leading edge was reprofiled with a conical droop, with the apex at the root, as to improve handling at low speeds. Because the droop remained within the shock cone of the leading edge, the drag rise at supersonic speeds was minimal. A second, inboard fence was also added at the time. A new canopy was also adopted while the tail was shifted slightly aft. The level of changes that could be implemented were restrained by the redesign having occurred at such an advanced stage of development. Yet, the overall changes made were so substantial that two-thirds of the roughly 30,000 tools created to manufacture the YF-102 were scrapped or modified before quantity production had even commenced.

On 20 December 1954, the first revised aircraft, designated &quot;YF-102A&quot;, made its first flight only 118 days after work on the redesign had started. The next day, it exceeded Mach 1 for the first time. The revised design quickly demonstrated that it could attain a speed of Mach 1.22 and a ceiling of 53,000 ft (16,154 m). These performance improvements were sufficient for the USAF to agree to procure the F-102; accordingly, a new production contract was signed during March 1954. On 24 June 1955, the first flight of a production standard F-102 occurred. From the 26th production aircraft onwards, a taller vertical tail with a 40 percent greater surface area was fitted to counteract flutter and a lack of directional control at high speeds; existing aircraft were also retrofitted with this change.

===Further development===
The production F-102A had the Hughes MC-3 FCS, which was later upgraded in service to the MG-10; it was used to locate enemy targets, steer interception courses, and control weapons deployment. The F-102 was the first USAF fighter to be designed without a gun, instead relying on missiles as its primary armament. It had a three-segment internal weapons bay under the fuselage for air-to-air missiles. Initial armament was three pairs of GAR-1/2/3/4 (&quot;Later re-designated as AIM-4&quot;) Falcon missiles, which included both infrared homing and semi-active radar homing variants. The doors of the two forward bays each had tubes for 12 Folding-Fin Aerial Rockets (for a total of 24 &quot;FFAR&quot;, with initially 2 in (51 mm) being fitted and later 2.75 in (70 mm) replacing them. The F-102 was later upgraded to allow the carrying of up to two GAR-11/AIM-26 Nuclear Falcon missiles in the center bay. The larger size of this weapon required redesigned center bay doors with no rocket tubes. Plans were considered to fit the MB-1 Genie nuclear rocket to the design, but although a Genie was test fired from a YF-102A in May 1956, it was never adopted.
The F-102 received several major modifications during its operational lifetime, with most airframes being retrofitted with infra-red search and tracking systems, radar warning receivers, transponders, backup artificial horizons, and improvements to the fire control system. A proposed close-support version (never built) would have incorporated an internal Gatling gun, and an extra two hardpoints for bombs, supplementing the two underwing pylons all production F-102s were fitted with for drop tanks (the use of which reduced the craft to subsonic performance). To alleviate this, bigger internal fuel tanks and an in-flight-refueling probe were fitted. 

In response to a USAF request for a specialized twin-seat trainer, Convair begun development of the TF-102A in April 1952. The side-by-side seating design, popularized in the 1950s (and used with the American Cessna T-37, British Hawker Hunter T.7 and English Electric Lightning T.4, among others), would require a redesign of the cockpit and a nose almost as wide as that of a Convair 340 commercial airliner. Development was put on hold despite being authorized on 16 April 1953 until issues with the fighter model were sufficiently addressed; the first firm order for the TF-102A was issued in July 1954, and a maiden flight made on 8 November 1955. The new nose introduced buffeting, the source of which was traced to the bulbous canopy. Vortex generators were added to the top of the canopy to prevent the buffet which had started at about Mach 0.72. The intake ducts were revised as the inlets were repositioned. Despite the many changes, the aircraft was combat-capable, although this variant was predictably slower, reaching only subsonic speeds in level flight. A total of 111 TF-102As were eventually manufactured. 

The numerous inherent design and technical limitations of the F-102 led to a proposed successor, initially known as the F-102B &quot;Ultimate Interceptor&quot;. The improved design, in which the proposed Curtiss-Wright J67 jet engine was eventually replaced by a Pratt &amp; Whitney J75, underwent so many aerodynamic changes (including variable-geometry inlets) that it essentially became an entirely new aircraft and hence was redesignated and produced as the F-106 Delta Dart. Convair would also use a delta wing design in the Mach 2 class Convair B-58 Hustler bomber.

==Operational history==

===Introduction to service===
In June 1956, operational use of the F-102A commenced, the first unit to be equipped with the type being the 327th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was initially based at George Air Force Base. In June 1958, the 327th was redeployed to Thule Air Base on Greenland, the USAF&#x27;s northernmost base, which permitted the interception of Soviet aircraft at a greater distance from the continental United States. Other overseas units, such as the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and the 57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Keflavik, Iceland, would similarly adopt the type and as such used the F-102 in the interceptor role through into the early 1970s until it was displaced by the arrival of newer fighter aircraft. Typical interceptions included Soviet long range reconnaissance flights and bomber patrols over the Atlantic Ocean along with various aircraft that were flying to and from Cuba.

The F-102&#x27;s official name, &quot;Delta Dagger&quot;, was never used in common parlance, with the aircraft being universally known as the &quot;Deuce&quot;. The TF-102 was known as the &quot;Tub&quot; because of its wider fuselage to accommodate its side-by-side twin seating arrangement.

During the decades in which the F-102A was in service, several new wing designs were used to experiment with the application of increased conical camber to the wings. Ultimately, a design was selected that actually increased elevon area, reduced takeoff speed, improved the supersonic L/D ratio and increased the aircraft&#x27;s ceiling to 56,000 ft (17,069 m). A modification was required to the landing gear doors due to the wing redesign.

By 1960, the Air Defense Command (ADC) had F-102 Delta Daggers in service. Throughout the 1960s, a considerable number of the ADC&#x27;s TF-102s and F-102s were stationed at Perrin AFB, Texas, for the purpose of training new F-102 pilots. They also provided platform training on flight characteristics of delta-winged aircraft for pilots who were destined to fly the B-58 Hustler bomber for the Strategic Air Command (SAC).

The type continued to serve in large numbers with both Air Force and Air National Guard units well into the 1970s. George W. Bush, later President of the United States, flew the F-102 in the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group based at Ellington AFB in Houston, Texas as part of his Texas Air National Guard service from 1968 to 1972.

===Vietnam War service===
The F-102 served in the Vietnam War, flying fighter patrols and serving as bomber escorts. A total of 14 aircraft were lost in Vietnam: one to air-to-air combat, several to ground fire and the remainder to accidents.

Initially, F-102 detachments began to be sent to bases in Southeast Asia in 1962 after radar contacts detected by ground radars were thought to possibly be North Vietnamese Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) Il-28 &quot;Beagle&quot; bombers considered to be a credible threat in that time period. The F-102s were sent to Thailand and other nearby countries to intercept these aircraft if they threatened South Vietnam.
Later on, Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strikes, codenamed &quot;Arc Light&quot;, were escorted by F-102s based in the theater. It was during one of these missions that an F-102 was shot down by a VPAF Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 using an AA-2 Atoll heat-seeking missile. The MiGs approached undetected, and one of the F-102s was hit by an air-to-air missile, which did not explode immediately, but remained lodged in the aft end of the aircraft, causing stability problems. As the pilot reported the problem to his wingman, the wingman observed the damaged Delta Dagger explode in midair, killing the pilot. This was the only air-to-air loss for the F-102 during the Vietnam War. The other F-102 pilot fired AIM-4 missiles at the departing MiG-21s, but no hit was recorded.

The F-102 was occasionally employed in the air-to-ground role with limited success, although neither the aircraft nor the training for its pilots were designed for that role. The 509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron&#x27;s (FIS) Deuces arrived at Da Nang Air Base from Clark Air Base, Philippines, on 4 August 1964. The interceptor was equipped with 24 2.75 in (70 mm) FFARs in the fuselage bay doors; these could be used to good effect against various types of North Vietnamese targets in daylight. At night, it proved less dangerous to use heat-seeking Falcon missiles in conjunction with the F-102&#x27;s nose-mounted IRST (Infrared Search &amp; Track), thus it often performed nighttime harassment raids along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Some F-102As were configured to accommodate a single AIM-26 Super Falcon in each side bay in lieu of the two conventional AIM-4 Falcons. Operations with both the F-102A and TF-102A two-seaters (which were used in a Forward Air Control role because its two seats and 2.75 in/70 mm rockets offered good versatility for the mission) continued in Vietnam until 1968 when all F-102s were returned to the United States.

===Later use===
During 1973, six aircraft were converted to target drones as QF-102As and later PQM-102Bs (simulating MiG-21 threat aircraft) under a Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) project known as &quot;Pave Deuce&quot;. Eventually, the program converted hundreds of F-102s for use as target drones for newer fighter aircraft, as well as testing of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Patriot missile system.

The F-102 and TF-102 were exported overseas to both Turkey and Greece. The Turkish F-102s saw combat missions during the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus. There have been claims of air combat between Greek F-5s and Turkish F-102s above the Aegean Sea during the Turkish invasion. A Greek internet website editor, Demetrius Stergiou, claims that the Greek F-5s had shot down two Turkish F-102s, while the Turkish side has claimed that their F-102s had shot down two Greek F-5s; however, both Greece and Turkey still officially deny any aircraft losses. The F-102 was finally retired from both of those air forces in 1979.

In 1976, the F-102 was withdrawn from U.S. service, while the last QF-102A / PQM-102B drone was expended in 1986. As of 2023, no F-102s remain in flyable condition, although many can be seen at museums or as permanent static displays as gate guardians at Air Force and Air National Guard installations.

==Operators==

Hellenic Air Force

In 1969, Greece acquired 24 of these aircraft for use by the 342nd All-Weather Squadron at Tanagra Air Base. 19 of them were single-seat F-102As, five were two-seat TF-102As. They served with the Greek air force until 1977, when the F-102s were replaced by Mirage F1CG fighters.
Turkish Air Force

Beginning in 1968, approximately 50 F-102As and TF-102As were transferred to Turkey from USAF stocks. Before transfer to Turkey, they were overhauled by CASA in Seville. They were initially assigned to the 191st Filo (Squadron) based at Murted, replacing the F-84F Thunderstreaks previously assigned to this unit. This unit was redesignated 142nd Filo in early 1973. In 1971, F-102s were also assigned to the 182nd Filo based at Diyarbakır, replacing the F-84Fs previously being flown by this unit. F-102s remained in service with these two squadrons until mid-1979, when they were replaced by the F-104G in the 142nd Filo and by the F-100C in the 182nd Filo.

<text>Alexander English (born January 5, 1954) is an American former professional basketball player, coach, and businessman.

A South Carolina native, English played college basketball at the University of South Carolina. He was drafted in the second round of the National Basketball Association (NBA) draft in 1976. English played the small forward position and was a star player for the Denver Nuggets in the 1980s. During his Nuggets tenure (1979–1989), the team made the NBA playoffs nine consecutive times, won two Midwest Division titles, and reached the 1985 Western Conference Finals. English played 15 seasons in the NBA for four teams, averaging 21.5 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. English scored more points than any other NBA player during the 1980s. He was named to eight NBA All-Star teams and made the All-NBA Second Team three times. English led the NBA in scoring in the 1982–83 season. His number 2 jersey was retired by the Denver Nuggets in 1992, and he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997.

After his playing career ended, English worked for the NBA, served as an assistant coach for several NBA teams, was involved in various business ventures, dabbled in acting, and became an NBA ambassador. He currently sits on the board of trustees at his alma mater, the University of South Carolina.

==Early life==
English was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina. For some of his childhood, he and his siblings lived with their grandmother while their parents worked in New York. During this time, English often subsisted on a single meal per day.

English attended Dreher High School in Columbia. On January 31, 2020, his number 22 jersey was retired by the high school.

==College career==
English attended the University of South Carolina in Columbia from 1972 to 1976. He started every game over a four-year career and was arguably the first African-American sports star at the school. He scored a record 1,972 points and was only the third player at the school to record over 1,000 rebounds and connect on better than 50% of his field-goal attempts. English was selected to two independent All-America teams in 1975 and 1976. In the academic realm, English &quot;developed interests that he still maintains in art, sculpture, literature, and, especially poetry.&quot; He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English in 1976.

==Professional career==

=== Milwaukee Bucks (1976–1978) ===
English was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round of the 1976 NBA draft with the 23rd pick. Playing behind notable wings such as Bob Dandridge, Junior Bridgeman, and Brian Winters, English struggled to break into coach Don Nelson&#x27;s rotation. Despite this, English showed promise during the 1978 NBA Playoffs, averaging 13.4 points per game (third highest of all Bucks players that postseason) off the bench while helping the Bucks past the Suns in the first round, before losing to the Nuggets in a seven-game western conference semifinals series.

=== Indiana Pacers (1978–1980) ===
Frustrated with a lack of playing time, English signed with the Indiana Pacers as a free agent after the 1977–78 season. English became a starter in Indiana and began to establish a reputation as a scorer, averaging 16 points per game during the 1978–79 season on another rebuilding team.

=== Denver Nuggets (1980–1990) ===
English was traded to the Denver Nuggets midway through the 1979–80 season for George McGinnis, a former Pacers star from their ABA days. Though coming off of an All-Star season in 1978–79, McGinnis was only a shadow of his former self and was out of the league by 1982. English went on to become a star player for the Nuggets.

In his first full season with the Nuggets in 1980–81, English averaged a then-career high 23.8 points.

In the 1981–82 season, English averaged 25.4 points and the team advanced to postseason play. He earned a position on the All-Star Team and All-NBA Second Team. The following year, in 1982–83, English won the league scoring title with an average of 28.4 points per game, while teammate Kiki Vandeweghe placed second averaging 26.7 points. Then in 1983–84 English placed fourth in the league in scoring.

In the 1984–85 season English raised his scoring average to 27.9 points to pick up some of the slack from Kiki Vandeweghe&#x27;s departure. Denver won its division and secured the second seed in the Western Conference. In the 1985 playoffs, English averaged 30.2 points as the Nuggets defeated the San Antonio Spurs and Utah Jazz to meet the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, where they would fall to the eventual NBA-champion Lakers in five games. English suffered a right thumb injury in Game 4, which required surgery and rendered him unable to play for the rest of the series. With the Nuggets already dealing with injuries to other players, English&#x27;s injury was thought by some to have nearly ensured a Laker victory in the series. English later stated in a 2006 interview that &quot;I think that if I had not broken my thumb [...] we had a chance to beat the Lakers.&quot;

English recorded his career-best average of 29.8 points per game in the subsequent 1985–86 season, finishing third in the league behind Dominique Wilkins and Adrian Dantley. In the 1986 NBA All-Star Game, English set his All-Star career-high by scoring 16 points on 8-of-12 shooting in 16 minutes off the bench for the West squad. During the 1986 NBA playoffs, English led the Nuggets past the Trail Blazers in the first round. In the Western Conference Semifinals, English averaged 29.2 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists in a six-game series loss to the eventual western conference champion Rockets. In the final game of the series, on May 8, 1986, English tied his own Nuggets single-game playoff points record with 42 during a 126-122 double overtime loss.

In 1988, English received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award for his community service efforts. On March 10, 1989, English scored 51 points, notably without attempting any three-point shots, and recorded nine assists during a 131–130 overtime loss to the Miami Heat.

After the 1989–90 season, in which English&#x27;s scoring average dipped to 17.9 and he largely struggled to maintain his level of play compared to previous seasons, English became a free agent, and the Nuggets elected not to re-sign him.

=== Dallas Mavericks (1990–1991) ===
At age 36, English signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks where he once again played off the bench, this time averaging just under 10 points per game. He played his final NBA game in 1991 for the Mavericks.

=== Napoli (1991–1992) ===
No other NBA team signed English for the 1991–1992 season, and after a stint in Italy with Basket Napoli, English ended his playing career.

===Legacy===
When English left the Denver Nuggets, he was the holder of nearly every team record, including most career points (21,645), assists (3,679), games (837) and minutes (29,893) in a Nuggets uniform, along with the highest career scoring average with the team (25.9) of any player. The Nuggets retired English&#x27;s number 2 jersey in 1992. , English&#x27;s career 25,613 points place him 19th on the NBA&#x27;s all-time career scoring list. While in Denver, English made the NBA All-Star Team eight times and the All-NBA Second Team three times. During his Nuggets tenure, the team made the NBA playoffs nine consecutive times and won two Midwest Division titles.

English retired with NBA career averages of 21.5 points and 5.5 rebounds per game.
He was the first NBA player to score 2,000 points in eight consecutive seasons, and he has the distinction of being the top NBA scorer in the 1980s. English was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named English as the 71st greatest player in NBA history.

==Coaching career==

English began his coaching career in the National Basketball Development League (now called the NBA G League) as the head coach of the North Charleston Lowgators in the 2001–02 season; this was the first season of the league. The Lowgators tied for the best record during the regular season, but they were eliminated in the championship series in the playoffs.

Before the 2002-03 NBA season, English joined the coaching staff of the Atlanta Hawks. The following year, he was hired by the Philadelphia 76ers as an assistant coach.

English then joined the Toronto Raptors in 2004 to serve as assistant coach and director of player development. On June 5, 2009, it was announced that English would stay with the Raptors as an assistant coach. On July 13, 2011, with the team heading in a new direction after the hiring of new head coach Dwane Casey, English was not given a new contract, and his services were not retained.

On January 13, 2012, English was added to the Sacramento Kings coaching staff under head coach Keith Smart. On June 5, 2013, new Kings coach Michael Malone announced that the 2012–13 assistant coaches, including English, would not be retained for the 2013–14 season.

==Other work==

===Sports===
English was the first-ever director of player programs for the National Basketball Players Association.

SEC Network announced on November 11, 2014, that English had been hired as a color analyst.

Since 2014, English has been an active participant in the Sports Diplomacy&#x27;s Sports Envoy program for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, he has traveled to Italy, the Republic of Korea, and Chile, where he worked with Nykesha Sales and Candace Wiggins to conduct basketball clinics and events that reached more than 1900 youth from underserved areas. In so doing, English helped contribute to Sports Diplomacy&#x27;s mission to reach out to youth populations in order to promote growth and a stable democratic government.
English participates in Basketball Without Borders. He is an NBA ambassador and has taught at NBA academies in various countries.

===Business===
English and his wife, Vanessa, owned Wendy&#x27;s franchises in South Carolina. English has also formed a company called GreenSmart Botanicals, which sells hemp-related products.

===Acting===
English has dabbled in acting. His acting debut came in the 1987 motion picture &quot;Amazing Grace and Chuck&quot;, playing a fictitious Boston Celtics star. He then had roles in the television series &quot;Midnight Caller&quot; in some 1989 episodes and played the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers in &quot;Eddie&quot; (1996). He also played a role as &quot;The Premiere&quot; in the 1997 film &quot;The Definite Maybe&quot;. English also appeared in a 1993 film about the hazards of drug use produced by the U.S. Department of Justice; he was presented as a good example to follow as someone who consciously avoided drug use and criminality, in contrast to co-star Ralph Coleman, a former Dallas Cowboys linebacker who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.

English later acted in a 2007 film called &quot;Lumera&quot; for which his son Alex Jr. was the producer and executive director. In 2013, he appeared on a half-hour TV special called &quot;The Nothing But Net Show&quot;, which was also directed by his son.

==Personal life==
As of 2020, English resides in Blythewood, South Carolina.

<text>Andrew Toney (born November 23, 1957) is an American former professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1980 to 1988. A two-time NBA All-Star, he won an NBA championship with the 76ers in 1983. Contemporary basketball greats Larry Bird and Sidney Moncrief put Toney on par with Michael Jordan offensively. Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe called Toney, “‘the most forgotten great player in NBA history.’”

== Early life ==
Toney was born on November 23, 1957, in Birmingham, Alabama. Toney attended Birmingham’s Glenn High School. On the basketball team, he averaged 31 points per game as a junior and 37 points per game as a senior. He was named Alabama&#x27;s “Mr. Basketball” as a senior, and was named to All-America teams as a junior and a senior. The team was 80-14 with Toney. He also played baseball and participated in track.

He attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana (now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette), and played basketball under coaches Jim Hatfield and Bobby Paschal. On the basketball team, he averaged 21 points per game as a freshman, 26.1 as a senior, and 23.6 over his college career. He led the team to a 21-9 record as a senior, going as far as the National Invitation Tournament quarterfinals. He was All-Southeastern Conference in 1980. He set nine school records, and scored 46 points in a game three times, including a game against Auburn to win the Bayou Class Championship. 

==Professional career==
=== Philadelphia 76ers (1980–1988) ===
Toney was drafted by the 76ers out of Southwestern Louisiana with the eighth pick of the 1980 NBA draft. On arriving in Philadelphia, future Hall of Famer Julius Erving took Toney under his wing. As a rookie, he averaged 12.9 points per game, had a .495 field goal percentage and was seventh in rookie of the year voting. 

His vaunted play against the Boston Celtics began in his rookie season. In a late 1981 regular season game he had 35 points against the Celtics. In the first game of the Eastern Conference finals between the 76ers and the Celtics, he had 26 points, and then 35 points in game two -- both of which were played in Boston. The Sixers were up 3-1 in the series, but the Celtics held Toney to only 17 points in the final two games and took the series.

He was dubbed &quot;the Boston Strangler&quot; by Boston sportswriters during the 76ers&#x27; and Celtics&#x27; rivalry in the early 1980s because of his ability to single-handedly dominate games against the Celtics. Most famously, in Game 7 of the 1982 Eastern Conference Finals, he scored 34 points in the 76ers victory over Boston. The game ended with the Celtics crowd shockingly chanting for the rival 76ers to &quot;Beat L.A.&quot; The Los Angeles Lakers won the 1982 championship over the 76ers, but Toney averaged 26 points and 7.8 assists per game, with a .529 field goal percentage, .750 three-point field goal percentage, and .862 free throw percentage in that series. During the 1982 regular season, on March 7, 1982, Toney scored 46 points against the Lakers and hall of fame defensive specialist Michael Cooper. 

Toney also scored 30 points in Game 2 against the Celtics in the 1982 conference finals, 39 points in Game 4 and averaged 22.1 points per game in that series. While his playoff career points per game average was 17.4 overall, against the Celtics it was 19.8. Celtic guard M. L. Carr said Toney&#x27;s passing made him even more impossible to guard. After the following season when the Sixers won the 1983 championship, the Celtics traded for big defensive guard, and future hall of famer, Dennis Johnson, in significant part to try and defend Toney (and Magic Johnson).

Toney was named to two All-Star teams, in 1983 and 1984, and averaged 15.9 points per game for his career. He was so difficult to cover defensively when holding the ball on the wing, with the ability to shoot or drive, that the 76ers bench players would shout &quot;torture chamber&quot; at the opposing player attempting to defend Toney.

Toney was an integral part of the 1982–83 76ers championship team averaging 20 points a game, alongside teammates Julius Erving, Moses Malone, Bobby Jones and Maurice Cheeks, all hall of famers, but his career was cut short after seven seasons by chronic foot injuries (only five of which were healthy seasons). The team did not believe that he was hurting before it was revealed that he had stress fractures on both feet. This led to a few years of bitterness between Toney and 76ers management, though he and the owner at the time, Harold Katz, improved their relationship. Some distance has continued between Toney and the team into the 21st century.

Toney retired at age thirty because of the physical problems with his feet.

Toney ranked second in three-point field goal percentage in 1981-82 (.424) and sixth in 1984-85 (.371). His lifetime field goal percentage is 50.0%, remarkable for a guard often shooting from distance.

=== Accolades ===
Pat Williams, vice president of basketball operations for the Orlando Magic, shared an anecdote with Tony Rizzo while being interviewed on &quot;The Really Big Show&quot; on ESPN850 WKNR in Cleveland on February 11, 2010, while promoting his latest book about the late Chuck Daly. Williams said that when he was a general manager back in the days of their great rivalry with the Lakers and Sixers (c. 1980–1983), he asked Danny Ainge, the Celtics guard, what player he worried about the most come playoff time. &quot;Not Magic or Dr. J, it&#x27;s Andrew Toney that keeps me awake at night!&quot; said Ainge. Williams went on to say that were it not for injuries Toney would have been a Hall of Famer. Charles Barkley stated that Toney was the best player he ever played with. Hall of fame player and Toney&#x27;s former coach Billy Cunningham, like WIlliams, believed Toney would have been in the hall of fame but for his injuries, and that he and backcourt mate Cheeks had just started to grow into their potential together. 

Hall of fame Celtics opponent, and member of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, Larry Bird, praised Toney as one of two shooting guards of whom he was most afraid. The other was Michael Jordan. Hall of fame guard Sidney Moncrief, who won the very first Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1983, and who had to defend Toney, said &quot;Toney was un-guardable ... he could do everything. ... I studied him, and it’s nothing you could do that could stop him from scoring, beyond double-teaming him and getting the ball out of his hands...&quot; He also found Toney very smart, with a counter for whatever the defender tried. Moncrief &quot;always put [Toney] right there with Michael [Jordan].&quot; After the 1983 championships, Hall of Fame Laker coach Pat Riley said “&#x27;Toney is probably the toughest clutch shooter in the league today ... He is just impervious to pressure.&#x27;”

In one NBA ranking of the greatest backcourt duos in league history, Toney and Maurice Cheeks were ranked eleventh out of seventy pairs.

In 1992, Toney was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. In 2013, he was inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. In 2016, Toney was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>The MG 42 (shortened from German: &quot;Maschinengewehr 42&quot;, or &quot;machine gun 42&quot;) is a German recoil-operated air-cooled general-purpose machine gun used extensively by the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS during the second half of World War II. Entering production in 1942, it was intended to supplement and replace the earlier MG 34, which was more expensive and took much longer to produce, but both weapons were produced until the end of World War II.

Designed to use the standard German fully-powered 7.92×57mm Mauser rifle round and to be cheaper and easier to manufacture, the MG 42 proved to be highly reliable and easy to operate. It is most notable for its very high cyclic rate for a gun using full-power service cartridges: it averaged about 1,200 rounds per minute, compared to around 850 for the MG 34, and 450 to 600 for other common machine guns like the M1919 Browning, FM 24/29, or Bren gun. This made it extremely effective in providing suppressive fire. Its unique sound led to it being nicknamed &quot;Hitler&#x27;s buzzsaw&quot;.

The MG 42 was adopted by several armed organizations after the war, and was both copied and built under licence. The MG 42&#x27;s lineage continued past Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat, forming the basis for the nearly identical &quot;MG1&quot; (MG 42/59), chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO, which subsequently evolved into the MG1A3, and later the &#x27;s MG 3, Italian MG 42/59, and Austrian MG 74. In Yugoslavia, an unlicensed, near-identical copy was produced as the Zastava M53.

The MG 42 lent many design elements to the Swiss MG 51 and SIG MG 710-3, French AA-52, American M60, the Belgian MAG general-purpose machine guns, and the Spanish 5.56×45mm NATO Ameli light machine gun.

==History==
===Before World War I===
Even before World War I, the German military was already looking forward to replacing the heavy machine guns which proved to be such a success in that war. The MG13 was one of the first developments toward a goal of producing a weapon that could perform multiple roles, rather than just one. The MG13 was the result of reengineering the Dreyse Water-cooled machine gun to fit the new requirement. The twin-barreled Gast gun was developed with the goal of providing a high cyclic rate of fire weapon for anti-aircraft use which was reported to have reached cyclic rates of fire as high as 1,600 rounds per minute.

===1930s===
This eventually led to the &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; (Universal machine gun) introducing an entirely new concept in automatic firepower. By changing its mount, sights and feed mechanism, the operator could radically transform an &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; for several purposes.

The MG 34 is considered to be the first modern general-purpose machine gun or &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot;. It was developed to use the standard German 7.92×57mm Mauser full-power rifle round. It was envisaged and well developed to provide portable light and medium machine gun infantry cover, low level anti-aircraft coverage, and even sniping ability. Equipped with a quick-change barrel and fed either with non-disintegrating metallic-link belts, or from a 50-round &quot;Gurttrommel&quot; (belt drum) or a 75-round spring-loaded saddle-drum &quot;Patronentrommel 34&quot; magazines (with a simple change of the feed cover for a Trommelhalter magazine holder), the MG 34 could sustain fire for much longer periods of time than other portable squad-level weapons such as the American M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), Soviet Degtyaryov machine gun (DP-27) and the British Bren gun, which were fed by magazines, while also being much lighter and more portable than crew-served weapons like the Browning M1919, SG-43 Goryunov or Vickers machine guns (which also lacked quick-change barrels). The MG 34 was also quite versatile; not only was it able to be fed from belted ammunition or a saddle drum magazine, it could also be fired from a bipod, an innovative &quot;Lafette 34&quot; tripod or various pintle mounts for armored vehicles. Switching between a bipod and a tripod required no special tools, as the mounting latch was spring-loaded. As the MG 34 &quot;Panzerlauf&quot;, it was used throughout the war as secondary armament on panzers and other vehicles.

However, the MG 34 did have fundamental drawbacks, such as sensitivity to extreme weather conditions, dirt and mud, and comparatively complex and expensive production. Attempts to incrementally improve the basic MG 34 design failed.

Between 1934 and the adoption of the final MG 34 production version, the &quot;Waffenamt&quot; (German Army Weapons Agency) realized the MG 34 &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; was too complex and expensive to mass-produce and started looking for ways to simplify and rationalize the technical concept.

===Development of the MG 42===
A draft specification was made and a contest was held for an MG 34 replacement. Three companies were asked in February 1937 to submit designs: Metall und Lackierwarenfabrik Johannes Großfuß AG of Döbeln, Rheinmetall-Borsig AG of Sömmerda, and Stübgen AG of Erfurt. The design and mock-up gun proposals were submitted in October 1937. Großfuß AG&#x27;s entry proved to be the best design by far, employing a unique recoil-operated roller locking mechanism whereas the two competing entries used a gas-actuated system. The Großfuß company had no earlier experience in weapons manufacture, specializing in pressed and stamped steel components (the company&#x27;s staple product was sheet metal lanterns). Dr.-Ing. Werner Gruner, one of the leading design engineers with Großfuß, knew nothing about machine guns when he was given the task of being involved with the project, although he specialized in the technology of mass production. Gruner would attend an army machine gunner&#x27;s course to familiarize himself with the utility and characteristics of such a weapon, also seeking input from soldiers. He then recycled an existing Mauser-developed operating system and incorporated features from his experiences with army machine gunners and lessons learned during the early stages of the war.

Being made largely out of pressed and stamped appropriately hardened carbon steel metal, only the most important parts were elaborately milled from solid steel, and using spot welding and riveting to connect parts the new design required considerably less machining and fewer high grade steel alloys containing metals that became scarce in Germany during World War II. It was much simpler to build than other machine guns – it took 75 man hours to complete the new gun as opposed to 150 man hours for the MG 34 (a 50% reduction), of raw materials as opposed to for the MG 34 (a 44% reduction) – and cost 250 RM as opposed to 327 RM (a 24% reduction).

The initial trials of the Großfuß functional model presented in April 1938 gave rise to improvement requests by the machine gun contest board. The resulting Großfuß MG 39 prototype gun presented in February 1939 remained similar to the earlier MG 34 overall, a deliberate decision made to maintain familiarity and capability to use the various mounts and other accessories developed for the MG 34 to adapt the gun to different roles. The only major changes from the gunner&#x27;s perspective were dropping of the saddle-drum-magazine feed option, leaving the weapon to fire belted ammunition, or from a single 50-round drum-shaped &quot;Gurttrommel&quot; belt container fitted to the gun&#x27;s receiver, and simplifying the weapon&#x27;s open sights for aiming purposes. All these changes were intended to increase, maintain, or accommodate the gun&#x27;s high cyclic rate of fire and dispersion. Although made of relatively inexpensive and simple parts, the prototypes proved to be considerably more rugged and resistant to jamming than the precisely machined and somewhat temperamental MG 34. Further trials resulted in selecting the Großfuß MG 39 prototype gun for final production development. A limited run of about 1,500 of further improved MG 39/41 pre mass-production model guns, was completed in 1941 and by the end of 1941 tested in combat trials.

===Adoption of the MG 42===
In early 1942 the final model of the weapon was officially accepted, and manufacturing of the mass-production model began, as the MG 42, contracts going to Großfuß, Mauser-Werke, Gustloff-Werke, Steyr and others. The MG 42 was first deployed in May 1942 by the &quot;Deutsches Afrikakorps&quot; (German Africa Corps expeditionary force in Africa) and introduced by mid-1942 on all fronts. Production during the war amounted to over 400,000 units (17,915 units in 1942, 116,725 in 1943, 211,806 in 1944, and 61,877 in 1945).

In 1943, MG 42 production surpassed MG 34 production and continued to do so until the end of the war. The Germans nevertheless continued widespread production of MG 34s in parallel until the end of the war.

===MG 42 nicknames===
The distinctive sound caused by the high cyclic firing rate gave rise to a variety of nicknames. The Germans called it the &quot;Hitlersäge&quot; (Hitler&#x27;s Buzzsaw), &quot;Schnelle Spritze&quot; (Fast Sprayer), &quot;Knochensäge&quot; (Bone Saw), &quot;Tripperspritze&quot; (Gonorrhoea Syringe) and &quot;elektrisches MG&quot; (Electric MG). The Soviets called it the &quot;Linoleum Ripper&quot;, and British and American troops called it &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Buzzsaw&quot;, or &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Zipper&quot;. Like the MG 34, British troops sometimes called it a &quot;Spandau&quot;, a traditional generic term for all German machine guns, left over from the famous Allied nickname for the MG 08 Maxim-derivative used by German forces during World War I and derived from its manufacturer&#x27;s plates noting the city of Spandau where some were produced. Brazilian expeditionary soldiers fighting in Italy used to refer to the MG 42 as &quot;Lurdinha&quot;; this nickname is due to the fact that the bride of one of the soldiers, named Maria de Lourdes, was a seamstress and the sound of MG 42 was similar to the sound of her sewing machine (&quot;Lourdinha&quot; is a common nickname in Brazil for women called Maria de Lourdes).

== Small arms doctrine ==
The German tactical infantry doctrine of the era based a (10-man &quot;Gruppe&quot;) squad&#x27;s firepower on the general-purpose machine gun in the light machine gun role. The advantage of the general-purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit.

It was possible for operating crews to lay down a non-stop barrage of fire, pausing only when the barrel had to be replaced. This allowed the MG 42 to tie up significantly larger numbers of enemy troops than was otherwise possible. The Americans and the British trained their troops to take cover from the fire of an MG 42, and assault the position during the sub 10 seconds time window of barrel replacement.

The Allied nations&#x27; infantry doctrines of World War II based a squad&#x27;s/rifle section&#x27;s firepower centered on the rifleman and/or a magazine fed light machine gun (BAR, Bren, DP-27/DPM, FM 24/29), and they used weapons with cyclic fire rates of typically 450–600 rounds per minute. The (slower) rapid firing rate used in emergency/final defensive line situations of the MG 42 was up to 500 rounds per minute. The Allied nations had machine guns with similar rates of fire, but mounted them almost exclusively in aircraft, where the fleeting opportunities for firing made such high rates necessary. The Allies did have similar weapons, such as the M1919 Browning machine gun and the Vickers K machine gun, but these were issued more sparsely than the MG 42, with the Vickers K being an aircraft machine gun, only issued to infantry in specialized circumstances.

===Light machine gun fire support role===
A German infantry &quot;Gruppe&quot; (squad) at the start of the war consisted of ten men; a non-commissioned officer or &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; squad leader, deputy squad leader, a three-man machine gun team (machine gunner, assistant gunner/loader and ammunition carrier) and five riflemen. As personal small arms, the squad leader was issued a rifle, or as of around 1941 a submachine gun, the machine gunner and his assistant were issued pistols and the deputy squad leader, ammunition carrier and the riflemen were issued rifles. The riflemen carried additional ammunition, hand grenades, explosive charges or a machine gun tripod as required and provided security and covering fire for the machine gun team. Two of the standard issue bolt-action Karabiner 98k rifles in the squad could be replaced with semi-automatic Gewehr 43 rifles and occasionally, StG 44 assault rifles could be used to re-arm the whole squad, besides the machine gun. A full &quot;Gruppe&quot; (squad) carried 1,800 rounds of ammunition for the machine gun between them.

===Medium machine gun fire support role===
In the German heavy machine gun (HMG) platoons, each platoon served four MG 34/MG 42 machine guns, used in the sustained fire mode mounted on tripods. In 1944, this was altered to six machine guns in three sections with two seven-man heavy machine gun squads per section as follows:
*Squad leader (NCO) MP40
*Machine gunner (private) MG 34/MG 42 and Walther P38
*Assistant gunner (private) pistol
*Three riflemen (privates) rifles
*Horse leader for horse, cart and trailer (private) rifle

The optimum operating crew of an MG 42 in its medium machine gun role was six men: the squad leader, the machine gunner who carried and fired the gun, the assistant gunner/loader who carried the tripod, and three riflemen who carried 1,800 rounds of ammunition between them, spare barrels, entrenching tools, and other items.

To enable the machine gun for its long-range direct fire and indirect fire support roles, optical sights could be added to a &quot;Zielfernrohrhalter&quot; (optical sight mounting bracket) on the tripod, allowing operating crews to continue using advanced planned and unplanned firing methods developed during World War I, though plunging fire or indirect fire methods were not as commonly used by machine gunners during World War II as they were during World War I.

==Operation==

One of the &quot;Einheitsmaschinengewehr&quot; (Universal machine gun) roles was to provide low-level anti-aircraft coverage. A high cyclic rate of fire is advantageous for use against targets that are exposed to a general-purpose machine gun for a limited time span, like aircraft or targets that minimize their exposure time by quickly moving from cover to cover. For targets that can be fired on by a general-purpose machine gun for longer periods than just a few seconds, the cyclic firing rate becomes less important. As a consequence, one of the MG 42&#x27;s most notable features was its high cyclic rate of fire of about 1,200 to 1,500 rounds per minute, twice the rate of the Vickers and Browning machine guns, which fired at a rate of about 600 rounds per minute. The ear could not easily discern the sound of individual shots being fired, hearing a sound described as like &quot;ripping cloth&quot; or a buzzsaw.

The MG 42&#x27;s high cyclic rate of fire sometimes proved a liability mainly in that, while the weapon could be used to devastating effect, it could quickly exhaust its ammunition supply. For this reason, it was not uncommon for all soldiers operating near an MG 42 to carry extra ammunition, thus providing the MG 42 with a backup source when its main supply was exhausted. Another disadvantage of the MG 42 was that the high cyclic rate of fire led to the barrel overheating quickly during rapid fire. After around 150 rounds of rapid fire, the gun operator would open a side hatch (leading to the barrel) and replace the hot barrel with a new cooler one. Non-observance of this technical limitation renders the barrel prematurely unusable. The machine gun crew member responsible for a hot barrel change was issued protective asbestos mitts to prevent burns to the hands.

The German military instructed that sustained fire must be avoided at all costs. They ruled that the results of sustained fire were disappointing and that the expenditure of ammunition involved was &quot;intolerable.&quot; In the bipod-mounted light machine gun role, MG 42 users were trained to fire short bursts of 3 to 7 rounds and strive to optimize their aim between bursts fired in succession. According to comparative tests by the US military under battle conditions, 5 to 7 rounds bursts with 22 bursts in a minute were most effective. For its medium machine gun role, the MG 42 was matched to the newly developed &quot;Lafette 42&quot; tripod. In the tripod-mounted medium machine gun role, MG 42 users were trained to fire short bursts and bursts of 20 to 50 rounds and strive to optimize their aim between bursts fired in succession. As a consequence of factors like the time spent reloading, aiming, changing hot barrels if necessary to allow for cooling, the MG 42&#x27;s practical effective rate of fire was 154 rounds per minute, versus 150 rounds per minute for the MG 34.

==Design details==

The MG 42 is a 7.92×57mm Mauser, air-cooled, belt fed, open bolt, recoil-operated machine gun with a quick change barrel.

Its parts are attached to a thick stamped sheet metal housing that functions as the receiver and barrel sleeve.

It weighed 11.57 kg in the light machine gun role with the bipod, lighter than the MG 34 and easily portable. The underfolding bipod, the same one used on the MG 34, could be mounted to the front near the muzzle to minimize shot dispersion or the center of the gun near the balance point offering more flexibility depending on how and where it was being used.

The shoulder stock is designed to permit gripping with the left hand to hold it secure against the shoulder.

The MG 42 incorporated lessons hard-won on the Eastern Front. Both the cocking handle and the catch for the top cover to the working parts were designed so that the gunner could operate them wearing arctic mittens or with a stick or rod. This was vital for winter conditions where contact by bare flesh on cold metal could cause severe injury, such as instant frostbite. The MG 42 also functioned well in other climates; dust and dirt in North Africa and Italy was less likely to jam the MG 42 than the more temperamental MG 34.

The MG 42 is capable only of fully automatic fire. Single shots are difficult, even for experienced operators, due to the weapon&#x27;s high cyclic rate of fire and the ability to fire a short burst of no more than three rounds was usually accepted as the training standard. The weapon features a recoil booster at the muzzle which adds extra rearwards force to augment that caused by recoil, thereby improving functional reliability and rate of fire. Besides amplifying recoil and managing and timing rearwards force exerted by propellant gas generated pressure, the recoil booster assembly ends in a muzzle shroud and also functions as a guide sleeve for the barrel and a muzzle flash arrester.

As the barrel of the MG 42 is changed through the side of the barrel shroud, rather than directly from the rear as in the MG 34, this made the MG 42 unsuitable for use as internal secondary or co-axial armament on World War II era German tanks or other armored vehicles, with the exception of the Jagdpanzer IV. Early versions of the Jagdpanzer IV carried two standard (no modification made) MG 42s on both sides of the main gun mantlet/glacis, firing through a firing port which was protected by an armored cover plate; the MG 42s were retracted when not in use. Later version Jagdpanzer IVs carried only one MG 42 as internal secondary armament.

The MG 42 belt-feed mechanism inspired the design used in the M60 machine gun. The trigger mechanism of the FN MAG or MAG-58 is a virtual copy of the MG 42&#x27;s, and the FN MAG&#x27;s belt-feed mechanism is also very similar.

===Operating mechanism===

The roller-locked bolt assembly consists of a bolt head, two rollers, a striker sleeve featuring a wedge-shaped front, bolt body, and a large multi strands around a central coil return spring, which is responsible for pushing the bolt assembly into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the bolt assembly, the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The bolt assembly locks with the barrel&#x27;s breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.

The roller-locked recoil operation functions as follows: two cylindrical rollers, positioned in tracks on the bolt head, are pushed outwards into matching tracks in the barrel extension by the striker sleeve and lock the bolt in place against the breech. In the locked position during firing the rollers rest on parallel surfaces relative to the bore axis on the bolt head ensuring a full lockup. Upon firing, rearward force from the recoil of the cartridge ignition combined with the additional rearward force generated by the muzzle booster start to move the barrel and bolt assembly rearwards for a total distance of . These two parts start the unlocking sequence after the barrel and bolt assembly have moved rearwards when the parts have moved far back enough that the rollers start the rest on angled/oblique surfaces and allow the rollers to move inwards, controlled by the wedge-shaped front of the striker sleeve, back to their previous position, unlocking the bolt head and allowing the bolt assembly to further recoil rearwards, extracting the spent cartridge case and ejecting it downwards through an ejection port normally covered by a spring-loaded dust cover at the bottom of the receiver, just in front of the trigger group. The spring-loaded dust cover automatically opens when the gun is fired, but the user has to close it after firing to prevent dirt entering the receiver through the open port. Simultaneously the barrel is pushed forward by a recuperator spring to its starting position. The three-wire braided return spring then pushes the bolt assembly forwards again, pushing a new cartridge out of the belt into the breech. The sequence repeats as long as the trigger is depressed.

The original MG 42 roller-locked action had an undesirable tendency to exhibit bolt-bounce. It was possible to unintentionally have high pressure gas moving backwards in the MG 42 towards the operator(s) when the action was not fully locked. This causes unacceptable dangerous conditions and out of battery ignitions can result in catastrophic gun failures. Enough guns were damaged and put out of action for repair or lost to warrant finding the cause and a solution. After investigation using high-speed photography the rollers in the bolt were found to &quot;bounce&quot; back and forth or oscillate up to when lock up is proceeding and then they settle into full lock up. Once the problem was identified, the temporary solution was to design and manufacture extra sturdy ammunition with primers with a slightly slower ignition time which allowed the rollers to settle into lockup and issue that ammunition specifically for MG 42 use. A more practical solution to control the harmonics problem in the roller/wedge system and make the MG 42 less ammunition ignition timing sensitive was needed. The roller-locking system inherent problem was solved after World War II by developing and adding bolt-bounce preventing bolt catches to the action. These can also be retrofitted to MG 42 bolts.

The cyclic firing rate of the MG 42 can be altered by installing different bolts and return springs. A heavier bolt uses more recoil energy to overcome inertia, thus slowing the cyclic rate of the machine gun. Heavy bolts also were used along with stiffer return springs. The standard MG 42 bolt weight for a 1,500 rounds per minute cyclic rate of fire is .

===Sights===
The open-type iron sighting line has a relatively short radius and consists of a &quot;∧-type&quot; height adjustable front sight on a folding post and a leaf rear sight with an open V-notch sliding on a ramp, graduated from in increments.

An auxiliary anti-aircraft &quot;spider web&quot; ring sight is kept in the maintenance kit, that can be fitted on the barrel jacket to be used in conjunction with a folding anti-aircraft rear peep sight that is attached by a hinge to the rear sight element base.

An active infrared device, intended primarily for night use, and consisting of a specialized mount, active infrared spotlight and accompanying infrared image converter was developed that could be used with the MG 42 and MG 34. In the later stages of World War II the bulky &quot;Fahr- und Zielgerät FG 1250&quot; (driving and aiming device FG 1250) active infrared unit was paired on Sd.Kfz. 251/1 &quot;Falke&quot; half-track armored personnel carriers to some MG 42 and MG 34 machine guns.

===Feeding===
The MG 42 could use non-disintegrating metallic-link belts, which have links that wrap around the cartridge case and are linked by a coiling wire on each side. The belts are intended for multiple reuse. As in the MG 34, operation through the feed block is by a feed arm housed in the feed cover. The feeding system was based on the direct push-through of the cartridge out of the belt link into the gun&#x27;s chamber. Accordingly, the link had to be of the half-open type to enable the motion of the bolt through the link. New in the MG 42 was that two belt feed pawls are linked to the front end of the feed arm by an intermediate link, in such a way that when one pawl is feeding, the other pawl is riding over the next round in the belt. Because of that, feed is performed in two steps, on both the opening and closing movement of the bolt, instead of one step as in the earlier MG 34. This enhances the smoothness of the feeding process by improved ammunition belt retention for more precise indexing with the feedway and reduces mechanical stress put on the feed unit and belt links. According to Infantry Journal in 1947, the operating momentum driven MG 42 feed system will not function reliably under a cyclic firing rate of 850 rounds per minute.

During World War II the &quot;Gurt 34/41&quot;-belt family was introduced. &quot;Gurt 34/41&quot; belt links and wire spirals were made of thinner material — the &quot;Gurt 34&quot; links were made of and &quot;Gurt 34/41&quot; links of thick stamped steel sheet metal — that saved ⅓ of metal and counterintuitively yielded improved performance. Belts were supplied in a fixed length of 50 rounds, but could be linked up to make longer belts for sustained firing. Ammunition boxes contained 250 rounds in five 50-round belts. A 250-round &quot;Patronengurt 33&quot; belt was also issued to machine guns installed in fixed emplacements such as bunkers. &quot;Patronenkasten 34&quot; and &quot;Patronenkasten 41&quot; ammunition boxes could hold up to 300 belted rounds and were used in more static non-highly mobile situations. The &quot;Patronenkasten&quot; could contain an &quot;Einführstück&quot; belt starter-segment.

The &quot;Gurttrommel&quot; assault drum was an alternative feed option and designed to be clipped to the left side of the gun. It was not a true magazine but held a coiled 50-round belt and corresponding &quot;Einführstück&quot; starter-segment preventing it from snagging, twisting and getting stuck during mobile assaults. The &quot;Gurttrommel&quot; belt container was commonly used until the end of World War II, with the MG 42 and the earlier MG 34.

===Barrel===
The long barrel and its prong type barrel extension used for lock up, made up the barrel unit of the MG 42. It could be quickly changed by the machine gun crew and weighed including the locking piece. The barrels could have traditional rifling or polygonal rifling. Polygonal rifling was an outgrowth of a cold-hammer forging process developed by German engineers before World War II. The process addressed the need to produce more durable machine gun barrels in less time than those produced with traditional methods. Later produced barrel bores featured hard-chrome plating to make them more durable. The different versions meant that the service life of an MG 42 barrel varied between 3,500 and 8,000 rounds assuming the barrel was used according to the regulations, which prohibited rapid fire beyond 150 rounds. Excessive overheating caused by rapid firing about 500 rounds through a barrel resulted in unacceptable wear of the bore rendering the barrel useless.

For carrying and protecting spare barrel units, consisting of a barrel and its locking piece, the &quot;Laufschützer 42&quot; (barrel protector) was used as a field accessory. When closed the &quot;Laufschützer 42&quot; looked like a tubular container with mountings at its ends to attached a carrying/shoulder strap. During a barrel change a cool MG 42 barrel unit coming out of the &quot;Laufschützer 42&quot; can be inserted in the machine gun and the replaced hot barrel unit can be placed in or on the opened &quot;Laufschützer 42&quot; to cool down. The &quot;Laufschützer 42&quot; was derived from the &quot;Laufschützer 34&quot; that served the same purpose for MG 34 barrel units. Later in the war the universal &quot;Laufschützer 43&quot; was introduced that could be used with MG 34 and MG 42 barrel units.

===&quot;Lafette 42&quot; tripod===

For the medium machine gun role a large tripod, the &quot;Lafette 42&quot;, was available that included a number of features, such as recoil absorbing buffer springs, a &quot;Zielfernrohrhalter&quot; (optical sight mounting bracket) for mounting an MG Z 34 or MG Z 40 periscope-type 4× power telescopic sight containing special sighting equipment for indirect fire, or the late World War II MG Z 44, designed for direct fire only. Fitting such an optical sight enabled the machine gun to deliver direct fire out to . An accessory to lengthen these sights&#x27; periscope was available to use these sights behind cover. The &quot;Lafette&quot; could be set up in a prone, kneeling or high position. The &quot;Lafette 42&quot; weighed on its own and was a simplified version of the &quot;Lafette 34&quot; used for the MG 34, as the MG 42 could be operated more easily from a &quot;Lafette&quot; and featured no semi-automatic firing mode. The legs could be extended with a &quot;Lafetteaufsatzstück&quot; to allow it to be used in the low level anti-aircraft role, and when lowered, it could be placed to allow the gun to be fired &quot;remotely&quot; while it swept an arc in front of the mounting with fire. Mounted to the Lafette and aimed through the MG Z 34 or MG Z 40 telescopic sight, the effective range of the MG 42 could be extended out to when fired indirectly. The indirect firing method exploits the &quot;s.S. Patrone&quot; useful maximum range, that is defined by the maximum range of a small-arms projectile while still maintaining the minimum kinetic energy required to put unprotected personnel out of action, which is generally believed to be 15 kilogram-meters (147 J / 108 ft⋅lbf). The &quot;Lafette 42&quot; tripod also had a bolt box to store a (spare) bolt and return spring.

Another unique feature of German World War II machine guns was the &quot;Tiefenfeuerautomat&quot; feature on the &quot;Lafette 42&quot; and &quot;Lafette 34&quot; tripods. It lengthened the beaten zone by walking the fire in wave-like motions up and down the range in a predefined area. The length of the beaten zone could be set on the &quot;Tiefenfeuerautomat&quot;. E.g., being unsure whether the real distance was , the gunner could make the mount do an automatic sweep between the elevations for and back. This sweeping of a selected beaten zone continued as long as the gun fired. The &quot;Lafette 42&quot; had a &quot;Richt- und Überschießtafel&quot; (Overhead firing table) riveted to the rear body of the searchfire mechanism from the very start of production until the very end of it. In the later stages of World War II ballistic correction directions were added for overshooting friendly forces with S.m.E. - &quot;Spitzgeschoß mit Eisenkern&quot; (spitzer with iron core) ammunition of which the external ballistic behaviour started to significantly deviate from upwards compared to the &quot;s.S. Patrone&quot; (s.S. ball cartridge). A trigger handle, which enabled the operator to fire the gun without affecting the aim, was attached to the &quot;Tiefenfeuerautomat&quot; searchfire unit.

There were numerous other specialist mounts for the MG 42. The &quot;Dreibein 34&quot;, for example, was a simple high-standing tripod for mounting the gun in anti-aircraft mode. There were also mounts for various vehicles, motorcycle sidecars, and fortress positions. MG 42s were mounted in multiple-gun arrangements, particularly for low level anti-aircraft defence.

The butt-stock was produced in various wood and bakelite versions.

==Variants and developments==
=== Finnish MG 42 ===
Finland acquired five MG 42s in July 1943 for evaluation. Three were tested with front units. Finland decided to produce 4,000 MG 42s modified to fire 7.62×54mmR cartridges but only one modified prototype was ever made.

=== MG 45 ===
In 1944, the material shortages in Nazi Germany led to the development of a newer version, the MG 45 (or MG 42V), which had a different operating mechanism that used roller-delayed blowback as opposed to roller locking. For this reason, the MG 45 is considered a different type of firearm, as the mechanisms of these two guns are different. It used steel of lesser quality, which reduced weight to , while retaining the horizontal cocking handle. First tests were undertaken in June 1944, but development dragged on and eventually only ten were built. The tested MG 45 fired 120,000 rounds in succession at a cyclic rate of fire around 1,350 to 1,800 rounds per minute.

The MG 45 had some influence in the post-war development of roller-delayed blowback system, as employed in issued CETME, SIG and Heckler &amp; Koch small arms.

=== T24 machine gun ===


The T24 machine gun was a prototype reverse engineered copy of the German MG 42 general-purpose machine gun developed during World War II as a possible replacement for the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle and M1919A4 for infantry squads. The T24 was chambered for the .30-06 Springfield cartridge.

By February 1943, US ordnance authorities published the first report on the MG 42, following testing of a captured gun. The quick barrel changing and belt feed systems were considered some of the best design features. The US Army wanted to be able to manufacture this general-purpose gun because it was technically advanced and much easier to make than the World War II US light and medium machine guns and it was decided to convert several MG 42s to fire .30-06 Springfield M2 ball ammunition.

Saginaw Steering Gear Division of General Motors received a contract to construct two working converted MG 42 prototypes designated as the T24 machine gun. It could also be used on an M2 Tripod. The gun was made as an almost exact copy of the MG 42 which was chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser. Some engineering changes were to use a barrel chambered for the .30-06 Springfield service round and an extremely increased weight bolt and stiffer return spring in an effort to reduce the cyclic rate consistent with US rate requirements. Saginaw Steering Gear did not adjust the prototypes for the longer .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) cartridge case.

When one of the two T24 machine gun prototypes was fired at Aberdeen Proving Ground, it fired only one shot and failed to eject the cartridge. A second attempt had the same result. The other prototype was plagued with excessive ejection failures and to a lesser extent failures to feed. The average cyclic rate of fire of the tested weapon was 614 rounds per minute. From January to February 1944, testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground were unsatisfactory. Firings were discontinued in February 1944 after 51 malfunctions and firing a total of 1,583 rounds by authorization of Major C. Balleisen, O.C.O. In March 1944 the US military concluded that functioning of the T24 machine gun prototype was unsatisfactory and recommended that further development was required before this weapon be subjected to the lengthy and severe standard light machine gun test.

However, the realization that the .30-06 Springfield cartridge was too long for the prototype gun&#x27;s mechanism to easily and reliably work with resulted in the discarding of the project. Saginaw Steering Gear did not get the opportunity to correct the flaws that caused the inability to obtain reliable uninterrupted automatic functioning and further optimize and ready the weapon for mass production before World War II ended.

=== MG 51 ===

The Swiss MG 51 or 7.5 mm Maschinengewehr 1951 was based on the design of the MG 42 chambered for 7.5×55mm Swiss GP 11. The final design, which appeared in 1950, was in most respects still similar to the MG 42, although many components were produced by machining instead of stamping, which increased the weight, the stability and the production costs of the machine gun. To prevent short shots Waffenfabrik Bern changed the locking system from roller to flapper locking. These locking methods are similar in concept. The resulting weapon had a cyclic rate of fire of 1,000 rounds per minute, was in the light machine gun role heavier than the German MG 42, and much more finely made and finished.

=== M53 ===

In Yugoslavia, this MG 42 variant was built at the state-owned Zavodi Crvena Zastava company as the Zastava M53 using original German machinery, retaining the 7.92×57mm Mauser chambering. By doing so, the Yugoslavs retained the original weapon&#x27;s design features, making the M53 a near exact copy of the German MG 42. The only major differences were a slower 950 rounds per minute cyclic rate of fire and no anti-aircraft sight mount. The aiming range of the M53 is , and the terminal range of the bullet is , the same as the MG 42. The MG 42s captured in Yugoslavia at the end of World War II were put into reserve of Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army as M53/42s. The last military use of M53s in Yugoslavia was in 1999. Some quantities of M53s were exported to Iraq in the 1980s and saw extensive action during both Gulf wars. The M53 was known under the nickname Шарац (&quot;Šarac&quot;).

=== MG 3 ===

At the end of World War II the original technical drawings and data for the MG 42 were captured by the Soviets. These would eventually find their way to Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. This forced Rheinmetall to reverse engineer the MG 42 for the development of the MG 3 (originally the MG 1 launched in 1958), which uses the MG 42 design but was rechambered to 7.62×51mm NATO. It remained a primary general-purpose machine gun of the modern German armed forces () until it was replaced by the Heckler &amp; Koch MG5 during the 2020s. The MG 3 has been used by more than 40 countries around the world, and it remains in widespread service today.

The MG 3 and its preceding variants all share a high level of parts interchangeability with the original MG 42. Like the MG 42, the MG 3 cyclic rates of fire can be altered by exchanging the standard weight (about ) bolt used for the standard 1,100–1,300 rounds per minute rate of fire for an extra weight (about ) bolt for a reduced 800–950 rounds per minute rate of fire. Those bolts also are used along with different recoil springs.

The Italian MG 42/59 licensed MG 3 variant produced by Beretta, Whitehead Motofides and Franchi since 1959, features an extremely heavy bolt which reduces the cyclic rate of fire to around 800 rounds per minute.

=== MG 74 ===
The final variant to date is the MG 74, developed by Austria and since 1974 it is the standard machine gun of the Austrian Armed Forces.

After its founding in 1955, the Austrian army was equipped with old guns temporarily out of U.S. stocks. Starting in 1959 these Browning M1919s were largely replaced by the MG 42 with modified barrel and bolt for the new 7.62×51mm NATO. But to introduce a modern weapon of its own production the Office of Defence Technology, in cooperation with Steyr Mannlicher and Beretta developed a gun specifically for the Austrian Army. The German MG 42/59 that was introduced in 1959 with the to replace the U.S. machine guns, served as the basis, which was similar to the Austrian 7.62 mm MG 42. Targets were to reduce, among other things, the cyclic rate of fire and weight and have more versatile sights and mount. The development of the weapon was completed in 1974. It replaced from this year the MG 42 as the MG 74 of the Austrian Federal Army.

The modifications to the basic MG 42 design include an extra heavy bolt ( vs. the MG 3 bolt) which reduces the cyclic rate of fire to around 850 rounds per minute. The rate of fire can be varied up to cyclic rate of fire of around 1,150 rounds per minute, if necessary, by changing the bolt and return spring. In addition, a select fire trigger group was added to allow semi-automatic fire (single shot) compared to the traditional fully automatic only fire capability of the original MG 42 design. The MG 74 also has a modern polymer stock and handgrips (usually colored green) to save weight, adjustable rear sight (35° horizontal, vertical 15°) and additional anti-aircraft sight or (low light) optical sights can be mounted optional.

===SIG MG710===

The Swiss SIG MG 710-3 general-purpose machine gun was based on the design of the MG 45 using a slight modification of the roller-delayed action and chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO. Its cyclic rate of fire is 900 rounds per minute. The first version looks very much like the MG 42.

===Influence on other designs===
The MG 42&#x27;s belt-feed mechanism was copied and used in the design of the M60 machine gun. The trigger mechanism of the FN MAG or MAG-58 is a virtual copy of the MG 42&#x27;s and its belt-feed is also very similar.

<doc id="239564" wikidata="Q163931" url="?curid=239564" title="Communist International">
<text>The Communist International (Comintern), also known as the Third International, was a political international which existed from 1919 to 1943 and advocated world communism. It was led and controlled by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and maintained strict conditions of affiliation in order to exclude social democratic parties and more moderate or non-Marxist socialists. The international was intended as a replacement for the Second International, which had dissolved in 1916 during World War I.

The Comintern held seven World Congresses in Moscow between 1919 and 1935. During that period, it also conducted thirteen Enlarged Plenums of its governing Executive Committee, which had much the same function as the somewhat larger and more grandiose Congresses. It initially focused on supporting revolutionary activities in Europe, Germany in particular, and resolved at its Second Congress in 1920 to &quot;struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state&quot;. During the 1920s, the Comintern became a battleground for Soviet internal disputes, such as the struggle between Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin over the question of &quot;socialism in one country&quot; which ultimately saw Trotsky expelled in 1927. After this, the organization was largely under Stalin&#x27;s direction.

From 1928, the Comintern adopted a &quot;Third Period&quot; policy of non-cooperation with social democrats against fascism, and denounced social democracy as &quot;social fascism&quot;. On the Nazi Party&#x27;s rise to power in Germany in 1933, this was reversed in favor of collaboration with socialists in &quot;popular fronts&quot; against fascism. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 saw the Comintern adopt a line of condemning both sides as imperialist, but after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 it began supporting the Allies, which the Soviets had joined, against the Axis. In 1943, Stalin dissolved the Comintern in order to avoid antagonizing his wartime allies, and the organization was succeeded in part by the Cominform in 1947.

==Organizational history==

===Failure of the Second International===
Differences between the revolutionary and reformist wings of the workers&#x27; movement had been increasing for decades, but the outbreak of World War I was the catalyst for their separation. The Triple Alliance comprised two empires, while the Triple Entente was formed by three. Socialists had historically been anti-war and internationalist, fighting against what they perceived as militarist exploitation of the proletariat for bourgeois states. A majority of socialists voted in favor of resolutions for the Second International to call upon the international working class to resist war if it were declared.

But after the beginning of World War I, many European socialist parties announced support for the war effort of their respective nations. Including the British Labour Party who issued a manifesto stating, &quot;the victory of the Germans would mean the death of democracy in Europe&quot; while making no such criticisms of the Russian Tsar. There were exceptions, such as the socialist parties of the Balkans. To Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s surprise, even the Social Democratic Party of Germany voted in favor of war. After influential anti-war French Socialist Jean Jaurès was assassinated on 31 July 1914, the socialist parties hardened their support in France for their government of national unity.

Socialist parties in neutral countries mostly supported neutrality, rather than totally opposing the war. On the other hand, during the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference, Lenin, then a Swiss resident refugee, organized an opposition to the &quot;imperialist war&quot; as the Zimmerwald Left, publishing the pamphlet &quot;Socialism and War&quot; where he called socialists collaborating with their national governments social chauvinists, i.e. socialists in word, but nationalists in deed.

The Second International divided into a revolutionary left-wing, a moderate center-wing, and a more reformist right-wing. Lenin condemned much of the center as &quot;social pacifists&quot; for several reasons, including their vote for war credits despite publicly opposing the war. Lenin&#x27;s term &quot;social pacifist&quot; aimed in particular at Ramsay MacDonald, leader of the Independent Labour Party in Britain, who opposed the war on grounds of pacifism but did not actively fight against it.

Discredited by its apathy towards world events, the Second International dissolved in 1916. In 1917, after the February Revolution overthrew the Romanov Dynasty, Lenin published the &quot;April Theses&quot; which openly supported revolutionary defeatism, where the Bolsheviks hoped that Russia would lose the war so that they could quickly cause a socialist insurrection.

===Impact of the Russian Revolution===
The victory of the Russian Communist Party in the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 was felt throughout the world and an alternative path to power to parliamentary politics was demonstrated. With much of Europe on the verge of economic and political collapse in the aftermath of the carnage of World War I, revolutionary sentiments were widespread. The Russian Bolsheviks headed by Lenin believed that unless socialist revolution swept Europe, they would be crushed by the military might of world capitalism just as the Paris Commune had been crushed by force of arms in 1871. The Bolsheviks believed that this required a new international to foment revolution in Europe and around the world.

===First Period of the Comintern===
During this early period (1919–1924), known as the First Period in Comintern history, with the Bolshevik Revolution under attack in the Russian Civil War and a wave of revolutions across Europe, the Comintern&#x27;s priority was exporting the October Revolution. Some communist parties had secret military wings. One example is the M-Apparat of the Communist Party of Germany.

The Comintern was involved in the revolutions across Europe in this period, starting with the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Several hundred agitators and financial aid were sent from the Soviet Union and Lenin was in regular contact with its leader Béla Kun. The next attempt was the March Action in Germany in 1921, including an attempt to dynamite the express train from Halle to Leipzig. After this failed, the Communist Party of Germany expelled its former chairman Paul Levi from the party for publicly criticizing the March Action in a pamphlet, which was ratified by the Executive Committee of the Communist International prior to the Third Congress. A new attempt was made at the time of the Ruhr crisis in spring and then again in selected parts of Germany in the autumn of 1923. The Red Army was mobilized, ready to come to the aid of the planned insurrection. Resolute action by the German government cancelled the plans, except due to miscommunication in Hamburg, where 200–300 communists attacked police stations, but were quickly defeated. In 1924, there was a failed coup in Estonia by the Communist Party of Estonia.

===Founding Congress===
The Comintern was founded at a Congress held in Moscow on 2–6 March 1919. It opened with a tribute to Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, recently executed by the Freikorps during the Spartacist Uprising, against the backdrop of the Russian Civil War. There were 52 delegates present from 34 parties. They decided to form an Executive Committee with representatives of the most important sections and that other parties joining the International would have their own representatives. The Congress decided that the executive committee would elect a five-member bureau to run the daily affairs of the International. However, such a bureau was not formed and Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Christian Rakovsky later delegated the task of managing the International to Grigory Zinoviev as the Chairman of the Executive. Zinoviev was assisted by Angelica Balabanoff, acting as the secretary of the International, Victor L. Kibaltchitch and Vladmir Ossipovich Mazin. Lenin, Trotsky, and Alexandra Kollontai presented material. The main topic of discussion was the difference between bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The following parties and movements were invited to the Founding Congress:
* Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
* Spartacus League (later became the Communist Party of Germany)
* Communist Party of German Austria
* Hungarian Communist Workers&#x27; Party (in power during Béla Kun&#x27;s Hungarian Soviet Republic)
* Communist Party of Finland
* Polish Communist Workers&#x27; Party
* Communist Party of Estonia
* Communist Party of Latvia
* Communist Party of Lithuania
* Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Byelorussia
* Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (Ukrainian section of Russian Communist Party)
* The revolutionary elements of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party (who founded the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia)
* Social Democratic and Labour Party of Bulgaria (&quot;Tesnyatsi&quot;)
* Left-wing of the Socialist Party of Romania (who would create the Romanian Communist Party)
* Left-wing of the Serbian Social Democratic Party (later formed the League of Communists of Yugoslavia) 
* Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden
* Norwegian Labour Party
* For Denmark, the Klassekampen group
* Communist Party of the Netherlands
* Revolutionary elements of the Belgian Labour Party (who would create the Communist Party of Belgium in 1921)
* Groups and organizations within the French socialist and syndicalist movements
* Left-wing within the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (later formed the Communist Party of Switzerland)
* Italian Socialist Party
* Revolutionary elements of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (formed the Spanish Communist Party and the Spanish Communist Workers&#x27; Party)
* Revolutionary elements of the Portuguese Socialist Party (formed the Portuguese Maximalist Federation)
* British socialist parties (particularly the current represented by John Maclean)
* Socialist Labour Party (United Kingdom)
* Revolutionary Workers&#x27; Groups in Ireland
* Revolutionary elements among the shop stewards (United Kingdom)
* Socialist Labor Party (United States)
* Left elements of the Socialist Party of America (the tendency represented by the Socialist Propaganda League of America, later formed the Communist Party USA)
* Industrial Workers of the World (a radical industrial union based in the United States)
* Workers&#x27; International Industrial Union (United States)
* The Socialist groups of Tokyo and Yokohama (Japan, represented by Sen Katayama)
* Socialist Youth International (represented by Willi Münzenberg)

Of these, the following attended (see list of delegates of the 1st Comintern congress): the communist parties of Russia, Germany, German Austria, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Estonia, Armenia, and the Volga German region; the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party (the opposition), Balkan Revolutionary People&#x27;s of Russia; Zimmerwald Left Wing of France; the Czech, Bulgarian, Yugoslav, British, French, and Swiss Communist Groups; the Dutch Social-Democratic Group; Socialist Propaganda League and the Socialist Labor Party of America; Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of China; Korean Workers&#x27; Union, Turkestan, Turkish, Georgian, Azerbaijani, and Persian Sections of the Central Bureau of the Eastern Peoples, and the Zimmerwald Commission.

Zinoviev served as the first Chairman of the Comintern&#x27;s executive committee from 1919 to 1926, but its dominant figure until his death in January 1924 was Lenin, whose strategy for revolution had been laid out in &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot; (1902). The central policy of the Comintern under Lenin&#x27;s leadership was that communist parties should be established across the world to aid the international proletarian revolution. The parties also shared his principle of democratic centralism (freedom of discussion, unity of action), namely that parties would make decisions democratically, but uphold in a disciplined fashion whatever decision was made. In this period, the Comintern was promoted as the general staff of the world revolution.

===Second World Congress===


Ahead of the Second Congress of the Communist International, held in July through August 1920, Lenin sent out a number of documents, including his Twenty-one Conditions to all socialist parties. Congress adopted the 21 conditions as prerequisites for any group wanting to become affiliated with the International. The 21 Conditions called for the demarcation between communist parties and other socialist groups and instructed the Comintern sections not to trust the legality of the bourgeois states. They also called for the build-up of party organizations along democratic centralist lines in which the party press and parliamentary factions would be under the direct control of the party leadership.

Regarding the political situation in the colonized world, the Second Congress of the Communist International stipulated that a united front should be formed between the proletariat, peasantry, and national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. Amongst the 21 conditions drafted by Lenin ahead of the congress was the 11th thesis which stipulated that all communist parties must support the bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in the colonies. Notably, some of the delegates opposed the idea of an alliance with the bourgeoisie and preferred giving support to communist movements in these countries instead. Their criticism was shared by the Indian revolutionary M. N. Roy, who attended as a delegate of the Mexican Communist Party. The Congress removed the term bourgeois-democratic in what became the 8th condition.

Many European socialist parties were divided over the adhesion issue. The French Section of the Workers International (SFIO) thus broke away with the 1920 Tours Congress, leading to the creation of the new French Communist Party (initially called French Section of the Communist International – SFIC). The Communist Party of Spain was created in 1920, the Communist Party of Italy in 1921, the Belgian Communist Party in September 1921, and so on.

In 1920, the Far Eastern Bureau of the Communist International was established in Siberia to develop their political influence in the Far East. Soon after its establishment, the bureau&#x27;s manager Grigori Voitinsky arrived in Peking and established contact with local communist vanguard Li Dazhao. Li arranged for Voitinsky to meet with another Communist leader, Chen Duxiu, in Shanghai and began to establish the Comintern China Branch, which evolved into the Communist Party of China in 1921.

===Third World Congress===
The Third Congress of the Communist International was held between 22 June–12 July 1921 in Moscow.

===Fourth World Congress===
The Fourth Congress, held in November 1922, at which Trotsky played a prominent role, continued in this vein.

In 1924, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party joined the Comintern. At first, in China, both the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang were supported by the Comintern. However, after the definite break with Chiang Kai-shek in 1927, Joseph Stalin sent personal emissaries to help organize revolts which at this time failed.

The Fourth World Congress was coincidentally held within days of the March on Rome by Benito Mussolini and his PNF in Italy. Karl Radek lamented the proceedings in Italy as the &quot;largest defeat suffered by socialism and communism since the beginning of the period of world revolution&quot;, and Zinoviev programmatically announced the similarities between fascism and social democracy, laying the groundwork for the later &quot;social fascism&quot; theory.

===Fifth to Seventh World Congresses: 1925–1935===

====Second Period====
Lenin died in 1924 and the next year saw a shift in the organization&#x27;s focus from the immediate activity of world revolution towards a defense of the Soviet state. In that year, Joseph Stalin took power in Moscow and upheld the thesis of socialism in one country, detailed by Nikolai Bukharin in his brochure &quot;Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?&quot; (April 1925). The position was finalized as the state policy after Stalin&#x27;s January 1926 article &quot;On the Issues of Leninism&quot;. Stalin made the party line clear: &quot;An internationalist is one who is ready to defend the USSR without reservation, without wavering, unconditionally; for the USSR it is the base of the world revolutionary movement, and this revolutionary movement cannot be defended and promoted without defending the USSR&quot;.

According to Russian historian Vadim Rogovin, the leadership of the German Communist Party (KPD) had requested that Moscow send Leon Trotsky to Germany to direct the 1923 insurrection. However, this proposal was rejected by the Politburo which was controlled by Stalin, Zinoviev, and Kamenev who decided to send a commission of lower-ranking Russian Communist party members.

The dream of a world revolution was abandoned after the failures of the Spartacist uprising in Germany and of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and the failure of all revolutionary movements in Europe such as in Italy, where the fascist &quot;squadristi&quot; broke the strikes during the Biennio Rosso and quickly assumed power following the 1922 March on Rome. This period up to 1928 was known as the Second Period, mirroring the shift in the Soviet Union from war communism to the New Economic Policy.

At the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern in July 1924, Zinoviev condemned both Marxist philosopher Georg Lukács&#x27;s &quot;History and Class Consciousness&quot;, published in 1923 after his involvement in Béla Kun&#x27;s Hungarian Soviet Republic, and Karl Korsch&#x27;s &quot;Marxism and Philosophy&quot;. Zinoviev himself was dismissed in 1926 after falling out of favor with Stalin. Bukharin then led the Comintern for two years until 1928, when he too fell out with Stalin. Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov headed the Comintern in 1934 and presided until its dissolution.

Geoff Eley summed up the change in attitude at this time as follows: By the Fifth Comintern Congress in July 1924 [...] the collapse of Communist support in Europe tightened the pressure for conformity. A new policy of &quot;Bolshevization&quot; was adopted, which dragooned the CPs toward stricter bureaucratic centralism. This flattened out the earlier diversity of radicalisms, welding them into a single approved model of Communist organization. Only then did the new parties retreat from broader Left arenas into their own belligerent world, even if many local cultures of broader cooperation persisted. Respect for Bolshevik achievements and defense of the Russian Revolution now transmuted into dependency on Moscow and belief in Soviet infallibility. Depressing cycles of &quot;internal rectification&quot; began, disgracing and expelling successive leaderships, so that by the later 1920s many founding Communists had gone. This process of coordination, in a hard-faced drive for uniformity, was finalized at the next Congress of the Third International in 1928.

The Comintern was a relatively small organization, but it devised novel ways of controlling communist parties around the world. In many places, there was a communist subculture, founded upon indigenous left-wing traditions which had never been controlled by Moscow. The Comintern attempted to establish control over party leaderships by sending agents who bolstered certain factions, by judicious use of secret funding, by expelling independent-minded activists and even by closing down entire national parties (such as the Communist Party of Poland in 1938). Above all, the Comintern exploited Soviet prestige in sharp contrast to the weaknesses of local parties that rarely had political power.

====Communist front organizations====
Communist front organizations were set up to attract non-members who agreed with the party on certain specific points. Opposition to fascism was a common theme in the popular front era of the mid-1930s. The well-known names and prestige of artists, intellectuals and other fellow travelers were used to advance party positions. They often came to the Soviet Union for propaganda tours praising the future. Under the leadership of Zinoviev, the Comintern established fronts in many countries in the 1920s and after. To coordinate their activities, the Comintern set up international umbrella organizations linking groups across national borders, such as the Young Communist International (youth), Profintern (trade unions), Krestintern (peasants), International Red Aid (humanitarian aid), Sportintern (organized sports), and more. Front organizations were especially influential in France, which in 1933 became the base for communist front organizer Willi Münzenberg. These organizations were dissolved in the late 1930s or early 1940s.

====Third Period====
In 1928, the Ninth Plenum of the executive committee began the so-called Third Period, which was to last until 1935. The Comintern proclaimed that the capitalist system was entering the period of final collapse and therefore all communist parties were to adopt an aggressive and militant &#x27;left&#x27; line. In particular, the Comintern labelled Social Democracy as social fascists and urged aligned parties to work to their destruction as the &#x27;moderate wing of fascism&#x27;. Especially with the rise of the National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party in Germany after the 1930 federal election, this stance gave rise to some opposition inside.

The Sixth World Congress also revised the policy of united front in the colonial (colonized) countries. China was considered to be one of such countries. However, in 1927, the Kuomintang turned on the Chinese Communist Party, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances with the &#x27;national bourgeoisie&#x27; in the &#x27;colonizal countries&#x27;. The Congress did make a differentiation between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang on one hand and the Indian Swaraj Party and the Egyptian Wafd Party on the other, considering the latter as an unreliable ally yet not a direct enemy. The Congress called on the Indian Communist Party to utilize the contradictions between the &quot;national bourgeoisie&quot; and the British Empire.

===Seventh World Congress and the Popular Front===

The Seventh and last Congress of the Comintern was held between 25 July and 20 August 1935. It was attended by representatives of 65 communist parties. The main report was delivered by Dimitrov, other reports were delivered by Palmiro Togliatti, Wilhelm Pieck, and Dmitry Manuilsky. The Congress officially endorsed the popular front against fascism. This policy argued that communist parties should seek to form a popular front with all parties that opposed fascism and not limit themselves to forming a united front with those parties based in the working class. There was no significant opposition to this policy within any of the national sections of the Comintern. It would have momentous consequences, with the Popular Front led by Manuel Azaña winning the 1936 election in Spain, and with Léon Blum&#x27;s 1936 election which led to the Popular Front government in France.

Stalin&#x27;s purges of the 1930s affected Comintern activists living in both the Soviet Union and overseas. At Stalin&#x27;s direction, the Comintern was thoroughly infused with Soviet secret police and foreign intelligence operatives and informers working under Comintern guise. One of its leaders, Mikhail Trilisser, using the pseudonym Mikhail Aleksandrovich Moskvin, was in fact chief of the foreign department of the Soviet OGPU (later the NKVD). Numerous Comintern officials were also targeted by the dictator and became victims of show trials and political persecution, such as Grigory Zinoviev and Nikolai Bukharin. At Stalin&#x27;s orders, 133 out of 492 Comintern staff members became victims of the Great Purge. Several hundred German communists and antifascists who had either fled from Nazi Germany or were convinced to relocate in the Soviet Union were liquidated, and more than a thousand were handed over to Germany. Wolfgang Leonhard, who experienced this period in Moscow as a contemporary witness, wrote about it in his political autobiography, which was published in the 1950s: &quot;The foreign communists living in the Soviet Union were particularly affected. In a few months, more functionaries of the Comintern apparatus were arrested than had been put together by all bourgeois governments in twenty years. Just listing the names would fill entire pages.&quot; Fritz Platten died in a labor camp and the leaders of the Indian (Virendranath Chattopadhyaya or Chatto), Korean, Mexican, Iranian, and Turkish communist parties were executed. Out of 11 Mongolian Communist Party leaders, only Khorloogiin Choibalsan survived. Leopold Trepper recalled these days: &quot;In house, where the party activists of all the countries were living, no-one slept until 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning. [...] Exactly 3 o&#x27;clock the car lights began to be seen [...] we stayed near the window and waited [to find out], where the car stopped&quot;.

Among those persecuted were many KPD functionaries, such as members of the KPD Central Committee, who believed they had found safe asylum in the Soviet Union after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. Among them was Hugo Eberlein, who had been present at the 1919 Comintern founding congress.

Trotsky, who was also marginalized and persecuted by Stalin, and other communists founded the Fourth International in 1938 as an oppositional alternative to the Stalin-dominated Comintern. In the years that followed, however, their sections rarely got beyond the status of the smallest cadre or splinter parties.

Although the General Association of German Anti-Communist Associations had existed in Berlin since 1933 as part of the Nazi government&#x27;s propaganda against the Soviet Union and the Comintern, a treaty of assistance was concluded between Germany and Japan in 1936, the Anti-Comintern Pact. In it, the two states agreed to fight the Comintern and assured each other that they would not sign any treaties with the Soviet Union that would contradict the anti-communist spirit of the agreement. However, this did not prevent Hitler from signing the Nazi-Soviet Pact with Stalin in August 1939, which in turn meant the end of the Popular Front policy and, in fact, that of the Comintern as well.

===Dissolution===
The German-Soviet non-aggression treaty contained far-reaching agreements on spheres of interest, which the two totalitarian powers implemented over the next two years using military means. On 3 September 1939, France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany after its invasion of Poland, beginning World War II in Europe. The Comintern sections now found themselves in the politically suicidal situation of having to support, for example, the Soviet invasion and subsequent annexation of Eastern Poland. The Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov declared in an October 31 speech that &quot;as far as the European great Powers are concerned, Germany is in the position of a State which is striving for the earliest termination of war and for peace, while Britain and France [...] are in favour of continuing the war.&quot; This position has been described as a way for the Soviet government to explain its refusal to honour proposals for economic assistance to Poland, which had been made before and at the start of the war, since &quot;it was found impossible to determine with any degree of certainty who was the aggressor and who the victim.&quot; The weakened and decimated Comintern was then forced to officially adopt a policy of non-intervention, declaring on November 6 that the conflict was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes on both sides, much like World War I had been, and that the main culprits were Britain and France.

This period only ended on 22 June 1941 with the invasion of the Soviet Union, when the Comintern changed its position to one of active support for the Allies. During these two years, many communists turned their backs on their Comintern sections, and the organization lost its political credibility and relevance. On 15 May 1943, a declaration of the executive committee was sent out to all sections of the International, calling for the dissolution of the Comintern. The declaration read: The historical role of the Communist International, organized in 1919 as a result of the political collapse of the overwhelming majority of the old pre-war workers&#x27; parties, consisted in that it preserved the teachings of Marxism from vulgarisation and distortion by opportunist elements of the labor movement.

But long before the war it became increasingly clear that, to the extent that the internal as well as the international situation of individual countries became more complicated, the solution of the problems of the labor movement of each individual country through the medium of some international centre would meet with insuperable obstacles.

Concretely, the declaration asked the member sections to approve: To dissolve the Communist International as a guiding centre of the international labor movement, releasing sections of the Communist International from the obligations ensuing from the constitution and decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International.

After endorsements of the declaration were received from the member sections, the International was dissolved. The dissolution was interpreted as Stalin wishing to calm his World War II allies (particularly Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill) and to keep them from suspecting the Soviet Union of pursuing a policy of trying to foment revolution in other countries.

According to historian Eric D. Weitz, 60% of German exiles in the Soviet Union had been liquidated during the Stalinist terror and a higher proportion of the KPD Politburo membership had died in the Soviet Union than in Nazi Germany. Weitz also noted that hundreds of German citizens, most of them Communists, were handed over to the Gestapo by Stalin&#x27;s administration.

===Successor organizations===
The Research Institutes 100 and 205 worked for the International and later were moved to the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded at roughly the same time that the Comintern was abolished in 1943, although its specific duties during the first several years of its existence are unknown.

Following the June 1947 Paris Conference on Marshall Aid, Stalin gathered a grouping of key European communist parties in September and set up the Cominform, or Communist Information Bureau, often seen as a substitute to the Comintern. It was a network made up of the communist parties of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia (led by Josip Broz Tito and expelled in June 1948). The Cominform was dissolved in 1956 following Stalin&#x27;s 1953 death and the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

While the communist parties of the world no longer had a formal international organization, they continued to maintain close relations with each other through a series of international forums. In the period directly after the Comintern&#x27;s dissolution, periodical meetings of communist parties were held in Moscow. Moreover, &quot;World Marxist Review&quot;, a joint periodical of the communist parties, played an important role in coordinating the communist movement up to the break-up of the Eastern Bloc in 1989–1991.

British historian Jonathan Haslam reports that even after in Moscow archives:
all references to the Communist International and later the international department of the central committee, which drove the revolutionary side of foreign policy, were removed from published diplomatic documents, in order to fit in with the prevailing dogma established by Vladimir Lenin that the Soviet Government had nothing to do with Comintern. I gave up co-editing a series of documents on Russo-American relations because my Russian colleague could not or would not get over that hurdle...Even today [2020], when the Russians are more liberal in their censorship of documentary publications, one has to verify where possible through other sources independent of Moscow. And although Comintern&#x27;s archives are available on the web, most of it them are still closed to the reader, even though officially declassified, and much of it is in German only. One always has to ask, what has been cut out deliberately?

==Comintern-sponsored international organizations==
Several international organizations were sponsored by the Comintern in this period:
* Young Communist International (1919–1943)
* Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern, formed in 1920)
* Communist Women&#x27;s International (formed in 1920)
* International Red Aid (MOPR, formed in 1922)
* Red Peasant International (Krestintern, formed in 1923)
* Red Sport International (Sportintern)
* International of the Proletarian Freethinkers (1925–1933)
* League against Imperialism (formed in 1927)
* Workers International Relief

==International Liaison Department==
The OMS (, &quot;otdel mezhdunarodnoy svyazi&quot;, ), also known in English as the International Liaison Department (1921–1939), was the most secret department of the Comintern. It has also been translated as the Illegal Liaison Section and Foreign Liaison Department.

Historian Thomas L. Sakmyster describes: The OMS was the Comintern&#x27;s department for the coordination of subversive and conspiratorial activities. Some of its functions overlapped with those of the main Soviet intelligence agencies, the OGPU and the GRU, whose agents sometimes were assigned to the Comintern. But the OMS maintained its own set of operations and had its own representative on the central committees of each Communist party abroad. In 2012, historian David McKnight stated: The most intense practical application of the conspiratorial work of the Comintern was carried out by its international liaison service, the OMS. This body undertook clandenstine courier activities and work which supported underground political activities. These included the transport of money and letters, the manufacture of passports and other false documents and technical support to underground parties, such as managing &quot;safe houses&quot; and establishing businesses overseas as cover activities.

<doc id="239571" wikidata="Q1379679" url="?curid=239571" title="The Order (white supremacist group)">
<text>The Order, also known as the Silent Brotherhood, was a neo-Nazi terrorist organization active in the United States between September 1983 and December 1984. The group raised funds via armed robbery. Ten members were tried and convicted for racketeering, and two for their role in the 1984 murder of radio talk show host Alan Berg.

The Order&#x27;s main objective was to start a white supremacist revolution against the United States, after which blacks, Jews, &quot;race mixers&quot;, and other perceived enemies would be exterminated. Inspired by &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;, the organization declared war on the federal government, which they called the &quot;Zionist occupied government&quot;. The Order drew up a hit list of enemies, and on June 18, 1984, radio talk show host Alan Berg was murdered in front of his home by Bruce Pierce, assisted by other members of the Order. Berg was number two on the Order&#x27;s list.

In December 1984, authorities were able to track down Robert Jay Mathews, the organization&#x27;s leader, to a house on Whidbey Island where he refused to surrender. Mathews was suspected of wounding an FBI agent in a previous shooting in Oregon. During a shootout, the house was ignited by incendiary flares and became engulfed in flames, and Mathews was killed. Mathews is considered a martyr by many white nationalists.

==History==
The Order was founded by Robert Jay Mathews in late September 1983 at his farm near Metaline, Washington. Reportedly, Mathews&#x27;s farm was where the members trained. Mathews had previously formed the Sons of Liberty, an anti-communist militia mostly made up of Mormon survivalists, fundamentalists and associates of John Singer that had no connection to the historical American organization of the same name.

A fundamental goal of the Order was revolution against the American government, which its members, and those of other white supremacist groups, believed to be controlled by a cabal of Jews with internationalist and Jewish-racial loyalties, rather than loyalty to the American nation. The Order was named after, and partly modeled on, a fictional terrorist group in William Luther Pierce&#x27;s novel &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. The Order&#x27;s goals included the establishment of a homeland (now the Northwest Territorial Imperative) from which Jews and non-whites would be barred. They often referred to the United States federal government as &quot;ZOG&quot;, an acronym for Zionist occupied government. Members of the Order included Randy Evans, Gary Yarborough, Bruce Pierce, Denver Parmenter, Frank DeSilva (also known as Frank Silva), Richard Scutari, David Lane, Randy Duey, and David Tate.

=== Funding ===
Next, the group discussed how to fund actions of the Order, considering bidding on lumber-jacking and timber contracts, counterfeiting money, diaspora funding from overseas oil countries, and robberies. Though timber contracts were legal, counterfeiting money appealed to the ideals of the group in that it undermined the government by devaluing US currency. Robbery was first denied as an option due to its perceived sinful nature, until someone suggested they could rob pimps and drug dealers, which would raise money for the organization as well as set back street criminals in their businesses.

The organization won a bid on a timber trimming contract for a trail in the Salmo-Priest Wilderness. After five hours of grueling work, Mathews decided to call off the work and head home. Headed back to the trucks, David Lane muttered, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re going to have to be better thinkers than our fathers were, because we&#x27;re sure not the men they were,&quot; while Mathews mentions that the pay off from the job &quot;would not fund the right wing for a week anyway.&quot; The Order decided to try their hand at robberies, attempting to target pimps and drug dealers. After weeks of trailing black men in flashy cars, they realized they had no idea what a pimp or drug dealer looked like, and decided to switch to other crimes for funding.

The Order raised money through robbery. This began with the robbery of a pornographic video store, which netted them $369.10. Their later robberies were more effective, including a bank robbery, followed by a series of three armored car robberies. In the armored car robberies, they took a total of $4.1 million, including their final armored car robbery near Ukiah, California that netted them $3.8 million. The Order detonated a timed firebomb in a movie theater in Seattle (causing no deaths or injuries), in order to occupy the police during their second planned armored car robbery that took place the next day. They also detonated a bomb at the only synagogue in Boise, Idaho. Proceeds from these robberies were distributed to leaders of sympathetic organizations such as William Pierce (National Alliance) and Frazier Glenn Miller, Jr. (White Patriot Party).

The Order also ran a counterfeiting operation, but their bills were of poor quality, especially early on, and they led to Bruce Pierce being jailed early on, which later precipitated the group&#x27;s downfall.

=== Downfall ===
The Order was ultimately brought down when a member, Tom Martinez, approached the FBI and offered to turn informant. His role in the organisation had been to pass counterfeit money and he had been arrested on June 29, 1984, for passing counterfeit ten dollar bills to buy liquor. After he was released on his own recognizance Mathews convinced him to go underground and during this period Martinez learned that Mathews intended to kill the liquor store owner in order to prevent him from testifying. When he learned of Mathews&#x27; plan, Martinez approached the FBI and offered to turn informant. 

On December 8, 1984, Mathews was cornered in a rented waterfront house off Smugglers Cove Rd near Greenbank Washington on Whidbey Island. After a two-hour shoot-out, which involved the use of machine-guns, tear gas and a helicopter used to illuminate the target with flares, Mathews house was engulfed by flames and, according to FBI officials, exploded in &quot;a huge fireball&quot;. Mathews had been wanted for the shooting of an FBI agent in Oregon two weeks before.

===Convictions===
Ten members of the Order were tried and convicted under Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statutes with the help of the testimony of Frazier Glenn Miller, Jr., who testified against Order members in order to have his own sentence reduced. In a separate trial, three other members of the Order were tried and convicted of violating the civil rights of Alan Berg. No one has been charged in the murder of Berg. David Lane, the getaway driver for Berg&#x27;s assailants, was sentenced to 190 consecutive years on the charges of racketeering, conspiracy, and violating Berg&#x27;s civil rights. He died in prison in 2007. Order member Bruce Pierce was sentenced to 252 years in prison for his involvement in the Berg murder, and died of natural causes at the Allenwood Federal Correctional Complex on August 16, 2010 at the age of 56. Like Mathews, Lane and Pierce are regarded by many white-supremacists as heroes, political prisoners, and martyrs. In another trial, 14 men were charged with sedition, conspiracy, and civil rights violations. Thirteen of them were acquitted, and the judge dismissed the charges against the fourteenth man for lack of evidence.

A 2011 NPR report claimed that some of the people associated with this group were imprisoned in a highly restrictive communication management unit. Richard Scutari, a member of the Order, was sentenced to a 60-year prison term in 1986, and was transferred to USP Marion CMU in July 2008.

==Members==
== The Order II (Bruder Schweigen Strike Force II)==
The Order II, which is also known as the Bruder Schweigen Strike Force II, was an attempt to perpetuate the activities of the first Order by David and Deborah Dorr, both of whom were previously members of Aryan Nations, but their activities were confined to the state of Idaho. The group launched its first attack on March 6, 1986, when it sent a packaged bomb to Gary Solomon, a local Jewish businessman who owned the Solomon Trucking company in Hayden Lake, Idaho. No casualties resulted from the incident and it is unknown whether or not the explosion caused any property damage. The bomb was sent by David Dorr, the leader of Order II, a group that grew out of the original Order, which had previously collapsed. Order II (Bruder Schweigen Strike Force II) was also anti-government and antisemitic.

On August 7 of the same year, a 12-inch tube bomb exploded at Fred Bower&#x27;s auto repair shop in Hayden, Idaho, causing about $2,000 in damage. No casualties resulted from the incident. The two perpetrators, David and Deborah Dorr, and an alleged third perpetrator, Edward W. Hawley, were members of the Bruder Schweigen Strike Force II.

On September 16, 1986, an explosion was reported in front of the house of a Catholic priest who lived in the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, in Idaho. The explosion caused no injuries. It only caused property damage. On September 29, 1986, his latest attack targeted a federal building, a telephone and luggage store, and a restaurant parking lot in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, without causing any injuries.

The ATF and local, state and federal security forces collected evidence from the scene of the blast and executed a federal search warrant at Dorr&#x27;s residence three days later. Special agents discovered a shelter that housed AR-15s converted to select-fire assault rifles in violation of federal firearms laws. Thirty other firearms, large amounts of ammunition, and counterfeit money were also found. They also discovered bomb-making components that were used in the September 29 explosion, as well as in previous bombings. The militants received federal sentences which ranged from 6 to 30 years and state sentences which ranged from 5 years to life in prison.

==In popular culture==
Several projects premiered during 1988, which drew inspiration from—albeit seldom direct depictions of—the events that unfolded during The Order&#x27;s brief reign: The Oliver Stone-directed film &quot;Talk Radio&quot;, starring Eric Bogosian (who adapted his own play) as a fictional radio DJ similar to Alan Berg, drew inspiration from his assassination. That same year, the film &quot;Betrayed&quot;—directed by Costa-Gavras and starring Debra Winger as an undercover FBI agent, tasked with infiltrating Tom Berenger&#x27;s clandestine &quot;family&quot;—also drew inspiration from The Order and its activities. And another play from playwright Steven Dietz, titled &quot;God&#x27;s Country&quot;, documented the real-life events in a triptych, utilizing several key individuals as characters. It premiered at Seattle&#x27;s ACT Theatre on August 18, 1988.

In 1989, the non-fiction book &quot;The Silent Brotherhood: The Chilling Inside Story of America&#x27;s Violent, Anti-Government Militia Movement&quot; (re-released as &quot;The Order: Inside America&#x27;s Racist Underground&quot;), written by investigative journalists Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, was published detailing The Order&#x27;s history of events.

A 1999 television film called &quot;Brotherhood of Murder&quot;, based upon the autobiography written by group member-turned-FBI informant Tom Martinez (along with co-writer John Guinther), aired on Showtime. It starred William Baldwin as Martinez and Peter Gallagher as leader Robert Jay Mathews.

The crime drama-thriller film &quot;The Order&quot;, loosely based on the aforementioned Flynn &amp; Gerhardt novel &quot;The Silent Brotherhood&quot;, was released in 2024. It features portrayals from Nicholas Hoult as Mathews; Alison Oliver as his wife, Debbie; Sebastian Pigott as Bruce Pierce; Phillip Forest Lewitski as David Lane; George Tchortov as Gary Yarbrough; Odessa Young as Zillah Craig; Victor Slezak as Richard Butler, founder of Aryan Nations; Daniel Doheny as Walter West, also assassinated by members of The Order; Matias Lucas as Tony Torres (based on Tom Martinez); and Marc Maron, in a cameo as Berg. Jude Law, Tye Sheridan, and Jurnee Smollett also star, in composite FBI roles. The film was directed by Justin Kurzel, with a screenplay written by Zach Baylin.

<doc id="239573" wikidata="Q275377" url="?curid=239573" title="Chaiyaphum province">
<text>Chaiyaphum (, ; , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), located in central northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Khon Kaen, Nakhon Ratchasima, Lopburi, and Phetchabun.

==Toponymy==
The word &quot;chaiya&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;jaya&quot; meaning &#x27;victory&#x27;, and the word &quot;phum&quot; from Sanskrit &quot;bhumi&quot; meaning &#x27;earth&#x27; or &#x27;land&#x27;. Hence the name of the province literally means &#x27;land of victory&#x27;. The Malay/Indonesian/Sanskrit word &quot;jayabumi&quot; is equivalent.

==Geography==
The province is bisected by the Phetchabun mountain range, with the highest elevation in the province at 1,222 m. The east of the province is part of the Khorat Plateau. The total forest area is or 31.4 percent of provincial area.

Tat Ton National Park is in the northwest, featuring some scenic waterfalls and dry dipterocarp forests. The biggest attraction of the Sai Thong National Park in the west is the Sai Thong waterfall, but also some fields of the Siam tulip. Similar fields can be found in the Pa Hin Ngam National Park in the southwest. This park&#x27;s name (&#x27;beautiful rock forest&#x27;) derives from the strangely shaped rock formations found there. Phu Laenkha National Park covers 200 km2 of forested hills northwest of Chaiyaphum city.

===National parks===
There are a total of six national parks, of which four are in region 7 (Nakhon Ratchasima) and Nam Nao in region 11 (Phitsanulok) and Nam Phong in region 8 (Khon Kaen) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Nam Nao National Park, 
* Sai Thong National Park, 
* Tat Ton National Park, 
* Nam Phong National Park, 
* Phu Laenkha National Park, 
* Pa Hin Ngam National Park, 

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
There are a total of three wildlife sanctuaries, of which two along with one other wildlife sanctuary, make up region 7 (Nakhon Ratchasima) and Tabo–Huai Yai in region 11 (Phitsanulok) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Phu Khiao Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Tabo–Huai Yai Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Pha Phueng Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==
The history of the city of Chaiyaphum dates back to the Khmer Empire in the 12th century, when it was a small city on the route from Angkor to Prasat Singh (Kanchanaburi province).

In 1817 the area was settled by Lao people led by Nai Lae, an official of King Anouvong of Vientiane, which was a tributary state of the Thai monarch. They settled in Baan Nam Khun Nong E Chan in Nakhon Ratchasima province, but soon abandoned it in favor of Ban Luang (today&#x27;s city of Chaiyaphum). In 1826 Anouvong rebelled against the Thai King Rama III, seeking to gain complete independence. Nai Lae, by then made a chao praya by the Thai monarch, supported the Siamese troops. Chao Phaya Lae was killed defending his city against Anouvong&#x27;s army, but Anouvong was defeated by Thai forces weeks later and Anouvong taken in chains to Bangkok. King Rama III remembered Chao Phaya Lae for his loyalty and awarded him the title Phraya Phakdi Chumpon. He is still a local hero and his statue has become a symbol of the province.

==People==
Most people in Chaiyaphum province are ethnically Lao. The first language of most people is the Lao language.

==Economy==
The principal crops of Chaiyaphum include rice, tapioca, sugar cane, and taro root. Chulabhorn Dam, in Thung Lui Lai Subdistrict, Khon San district is a major source of irrigation water. Due to the severe drought in 2019, the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) is proposing to build three more dams in Chaiyaphum: Wang Saphung Dam in Nong Bua Daeng District, Lam Nam Chee Dam in Ban Khwao District, and Prong Khun Petch Dam in Nong Bua Rawe District. The dams would have a combined capacity of 160 million m3 of water, which could irrigate 127,000 rai of farmland.

== Health ==
Chaiyaphum Hospital is the main hospital of the province, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows a triangular flag, a symbol of victory in war.

The provincial tree is the Siamese senna (&quot;Cassia siamea&quot;), and the provincial flower the Siam Tulip (&quot;Curcuma alismatifolia&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is the bronze featherback (&quot;Notopterus notopterus&quot;).

The provincial slogan เมืองโบราณ บ้านนักสู้ ภูเสียดฟ้า ป่าช้างหลาย ทุ่งไพรรก น้ำตกใส ผ้าไหมดี สตรีงาม แดนธรรมแดนทอง
translates to &#x27;Enchanted city, home to heroes, mountain peaks, elephant forests, waterfalls, beautiful silk, lovely ladies, conscientious Buddhists&#x27;.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 16 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 124 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 1393 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Chaiyaphum Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 36 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Chaiyaphum has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 35 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 106 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="239576" wikidata="Q3967408" url="?curid=239576" title="List of defunct NFL franchises">
<text>Membership in the National Football League (NFL) is certified by a franchise. A franchise is awarded by the league to each member club and serves as the league&#x27;s authorization to operate as a professional football club in their city. Franchises award member clubs the exclusive right to hold professional football games between league members within a 75-mile radius of their city as well as the exclusive rights to market games in their area. There are currently 32 clubs in the league, and new members can only be approved with the support of 3/4s of current members. In the case of egregious misbehavior, a club&#x27;s franchise can be revoked or suspended by the league&#x27;s commissioner.

The NFL has had a total of 49 franchises become defunct over its history; this includes ten of the league&#x27;s twelve founding members, with only the Chicago Bears and Arizona Cardinals surviving to the present day. By 1926, the league had expanded to 22 franchises, but a league meeting in April 1927 led to the decision to revoke the franchises of the clubs in the weakest financial situations; 10 franchises were ultimately revoked.

Five defunct NFL franchises (the Akron Pros/Indians, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Bulldogs/Indians, Frankford Yellow Jackets, and Providence Steamrollers) had previously won NFL championships. The most recent franchise to become defunct was the Dallas Texans, which folded in 1952 after one season in the league.

<doc id="239582" wikidata="Q440558" url="?curid=239582" title="Cyril Lucaris">
<text>Cyril I of Constantinople (&quot;Cyril Lucaris&quot; or &quot;Kyrillos Loukaris&quot; (; 13 November 1572 – 27 June 1638) was a Greek prelate and theologian, and a native of Heraklion, Crete (then under the Republic of Venice). He later became the Greek Patriarch of Alexandria as Cyril III and Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as Cyril I. He has been said to have attempted a reform of the Eastern Orthodox Church along Calvinist Protestant lines. Attempts to bring Calvinism into the Orthodox Church were rejected, and Cyril I&#x27;s actions, motivations, and specific viewpoints remain a matter of debate among scholars. Cyril I is locally venerated as a hieromartyr in the Alexandrian Orthodox Church; the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria glorified Loukaris on 6 October 2009, and his memory is commemorated on 27 June.

== Life ==
Cyril Lucaris was born in Candia (Heraklion), Kingdom of Candia on 13 November 1572, when the island was part of the Republic of Venice&#x27;s Stato da Mar. In his youth, he travelled through Europe, studying at Venice and the University of Padua, and at Geneva where he came under the influence of Calvinism and the Reformed faith. Lucaris pursued theological studies in Venice and Padua, Wittenberg and Geneva where he developed greater antipathy for Roman Catholicism. Probably, during that time he was the Rector of Ostroh Academy.

While the exact date is unknown, Cyril Lucaris was ordained in Constantinople. In 1596 Lucaris was sent to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by Meletius I of Constantinople, patriarch of Alexandria, to lead the Orthodox opposition to the Union of Brest, which proposed a union of Kiev with Rome. For six years Lucaris served as professor of the Orthodox academy in Vilnius (now in Lithuania). In 1601, Lucaris was installed as the Patriarch of Alexandria at the age of twenty-nine. He would continue to hold this office for twenty years, until his elevation to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. During these years, Cyril I adopted a theology which was heavily influenced by Protestant Reformation doctrine. On 6 September, he wrote a letter to Marco Antonio de Dominis, a former Roman Catholic Archbishop, writing:
Due to Turkish oppression combined with the proselytization of the Orthodox faithful by Jesuit missionaries, there was a shortage of schools which taught the Orthodox Faith and the Greek language. Roman Catholic schools were set up and Catholic churches were built next to Orthodox ones, and since Orthodox priests were in short supply something had to be done. His first act was to found a theological seminary in Mount Athos, the &quot;Athoniada&quot; school.

In 1627, he authorised the establishment of a Greek language printing press in Constantinople, the first of its kind. However, the French government lodged an official protest with Ottoman authorities once the press began to publish anti-Catholic polemics, and as a result, Ottoman authorities ordered its closure one year later.

He sponsored Maximos of Gallipoli to produce the first translation of the New Testament in Modern Greek.

== Calvinism ==
Cyril I&#x27;s aim was to reform the Eastern Orthodox Church along Calvinistic lines, and to this end he sent many young Greek theologians to the universities of Switzerland, the northern Netherlands and England. In 1629 he published his famous &quot;Confessio&quot; (Calvinistic doctrine), but as far as possible accommodated to the language and creeds of the Orthodox Church. It appeared the same year in two Latin editions, four French, one German and one English, and in the Eastern Church it started a controversy which brought critics at several synods, in 1638 at Constantinople, in 1642 at the Synod of Iași and culminated in 1672 with the convocation by Dositheus II of Jerusalem, Patriarch of Jerusalem, of the Synod of Jerusalem, by which the Calvinistic doctrines were condemned.

Cyril I was also particularly well disposed towards the Church of England, and corresponded with the Archbishops of Canterbury. It was in his time that Metrophanes Kritopoulos – later to become Patriarch of Alexandria (1636–1639) – was sent to England to study. Both Cyril I and Metrophanes Kritopoulos were lovers of books and manuscripts, and many of the items in the collections of books and these two Patriarchs acquired manuscripts that today adorn the Patriarchal Library.

In 1629 in Geneva the &quot;Eastern Confession of the Christian faith&quot; was published in Latin, containing the Calvinist doctrine. In 1633 it was published in Greek. The Council of Constantinople in 1638 anathematised both Cyril I and the &quot;Eastern Confession of the Christian faith&quot;, but the Synod of Jerusalem in 1672, specially engaged in the case of Cyril I, completely acquitted him, testified that the Council of Constantinople cursed Cyril I not because they thought he was the author of the confession, but for the fact that Cyril I hadn&#x27;t written a rebuttal to this essay attributed to him.

The overwhelming majority of Greek and Russian Orthodox scholars (Ivan Malyshevsky, bishop Arsenius Bryantsev, Vasily Malakhov, George Michaelides, Nikolay Talberg) have denied the authenticity of the &quot;Confessio&quot;, which resulted in the canonisation of Cyril I in 2009 by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, and on 11 January 2022 by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.

Nevertheless, some scholars argue that the Confession was the work of Lucaris, noting &quot;the evidence that (the Confession) is his is overwhelming. There is an extant manuscript that is clearly in Cyril I&#x27;s handwriting. The language used echoes that of his other writings. We have multiple records of his having admitted it to be his, and none of his denial of it, nor of any effort to counter it&quot;.

== Politics and death ==
Cyril I was several times temporarily deposed and banished at the instigation of both his Orthodox opponents and the French and Austrian ambassadors, while he was supported by the Protestant Dutch and English ambassadors to the Ottoman capital. Finally, when the Ottoman Sultan Murad IV was about to set out for the Persian War, the Patriarch was accused of a design to stir up the Cossacks, and to avoid trouble during his absence the Sultan had him strangled by the Janissaries on 27 June 1638 aboard a ship in the Bosporus. His body was thrown into the sea, but it was recovered and buried at a distance from the capital by his friends, and only brought back to Constantinople after many years.

Cyril I was honoured as a saint and martyr shortly after his death, and Eugenios of Aitolia compiled an &quot;Acolouthia&quot; (service) to celebrate his memory.

According to a 1659 letter to Thomas Greaves from Edward Pococke (who, on his book-hunting travels for archbishop William Laud, had met Lucaris), many of the choicest manuscripts from Cyril I&#x27;s library were saved by the Dutch ambassador who sent them by ship to Holland. Although the ship arrived safely, it sank the next day in a violent storm along with its cargo.

<text>The Dallas Texans played in the National Football League (NFL) for one season in 1952. They posted a record of 1–11.

Initially based in Dallas, the team was returned to the league in the middle of the season and became a traveling team based in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Akron, Ohio. 

Professional football returned to Dallas in 1960, as the American Football League (AFL) commenced operations with one of its eight charter members in Dallas, also called the Texans, while the NFL added the Dallas Cowboys. The AFL Dallas Texans would later move to Kansas City, Missouri, and be re-branded as the &quot;Chiefs&quot; in 1963.

After the team folded, the league awarded its assets to the new Baltimore Colts, who retained the team&#x27;s blue-and-white colors. However, neither the Colts nor the NFL recognize the Texans or their previous incarnations dating back to 1944 as part of the Colts&#x27; legacy. Thus, as of 2025, the Dallas Texans are the most recent NFL team to fold and not have its legacy included in that of any other team.

==History==
After the 1951 season, the financially troubled New York Yanks franchise was put on the market by Ted Collins, who had founded the franchise in 1944 as the Boston Yanks before moving it to New York City in 1949, rebranding them as the Bulldogs, and rebranded it again as the Yanks in 1950. After failing to find a buyer, Collins sold the team back to the League.

On January 29, 1952, a Dallas-based group led by a pair of young millionaires, brothers Giles and Connell Miller, completed the purchase of what was ostensibly a new franchise: the first-ever major league sports team based in Texas. However, the Millers also acquired the entire Yanks roster in the sale; thus, for all intents and purposes, the brothers bought the Yanks and relocated them to Dallas. Purchase price for the team was $200,000 — with $100,000 paid up front and the balance paid in installments. This comparatively vast expansion fee was charged to allow the league to buy out the Yanks&#x27; lease for the use of Yankee Stadium.

NFL owners voted 10–1 in favor of the sale and relocation, with Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney casting the lone dissenting vote.

Home games were set for the 75,000-seat Cotton Bowl, home stadium of the Southern Methodist University Mustangs. Three names were considered for the new franchise: the Rangers, the Rebels, or the Texans. The last-mentioned was eventually the moniker chosen.

===1952 season===
The Millers believed that the growing state of Texas, with its longstanding support of college and high school football, would be a natural fit for the NFL to move farther south and west. With this in mind, Giles Miller declared, &quot;There is room in Texas for all kinds of football.&quot;

However, the opening game against the New York Giants set the tone for the season and the franchise. While the Texans scored the first touchdown, they missed the extra point and did not score again, losing 24–6 in front of only 17,499 fans at the Cotton Bowl.

Fan interest quickly waned as the team collapsed to 0–9 and showed no sign of being competitive. In the four games the Texans played at the Cotton Bowl, they lost all four by an average of eighteen points, and drew a total of only 54,065 fans: this was by far the lowest in the League, and barely half of the 25,000 per game required for the team to break even. The nadir came in a November 9 game against the Los Angeles Rams, a 27–6 blowout loss which attracted only 10,000 fans, and as it turned out, would be the last game the Texans would play in Texas.

By this time, the Millers had sustained losses of $250,000, a staggering sum by 1950s standards, and were unable to meet payroll. The situation was exacerbated by the woeful ticket sales and an inability to get any financial support from local businesses – an important factor even in this decade – to cover these debts, or even operating expenses. Unlike present economic arrangements in which the NFL&#x27;s multi-billion-dollar television contracts essentially underwrite the league&#x27;s franchises, teams in this era had no hope of remaining solvent without local support. NFL games were not carried on national TV at all until 1953, and then only on the now-long-defunct DuMont Television Network, for a pittance compared to the contracts of today. Only two Texans games were televised: October 12 against the Bears in Chicago on ABC, and the Thanksgiving game (see below), also against the Bears, on DuMont.

The Millers had seen enough and sold the team back to the league on November 14, with five games remaining in the season. Afterwards, the NFL moved the franchise&#x27;s operations temporarily to Hershey, Pennsylvania (though it kept the Dallas Texans name), and moved the Texans&#x27; last two home games out of Dallas, thus making them a traveling team.
The team played one of its remaining two relocated home games at the Rubber Bowl in Akron, Ohio, where the franchise tallied its only win under the Texans moniker, an upset over the Chicago Bears of George Halas, in front of a meager crowd of only 2,208 fans on Thanksgiving Day. This remains the smallest crowd at any NFL game since 1939 (excluding 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic severely limited attendance).

As a measure of how low the NFL ranked on the sports scene in the early 1950s, the Akron high school Championship Game played at the Rubber Bowl that morning attracted 14,284 fans, far outdrawing the afternoon&#x27;s professional contest.

Head coach Jim Phelan jokingly suggested because of the small turnout, the Texans players should &quot;go into the stands and shake hands with each fan,&quot; while Halas had been so certain that the Bears would overpower the lowly Texans that he started only his second-string players. The Texans jumped out to a 20–2 lead, and after a Bears rally, scored a touchdown with 34 seconds left for an upset 27–23 win.

With the victory, the NFL avoided having a franchise with a winless regular season, something that had not happened since .

The team&#x27;s final game was a 41–6 blowout loss at the hands of the Detroit Lions: while this game had been scheduled to be played in Dallas, it was moved to Detroit after the league took over the team, thus forcing the Texans (who were the designated home team) to make their second trip of the year to Briggs Stadium – this game drew 12,252 fans, less than one-third of the average for the Lions&#x27; home games that year. Two weeks later, the Lions won the NFL Championship.

Halfback George Taliaferro, the team&#x27;s leading rusher, was selected to the Pro Bowl at the end of the season.

===The end of the Texans===
For all intents and purposes, the conclusion of the Texans&#x27; brief history was written before they even played their last game. Unable to find a buyer for the team, but not wanting to outright contract the franchise (which would have unbalanced the schedule), the NFL quickly began to solicit bids from other cities. The week after the Texans&#x27; Thanksgiving upset, the NFL granted a new franchise to a Baltimore-based ownership group headed by Carroll Rosenbloom, and awarded it the remaining assets (including the players) of the Texans organization. Rosenbloom named his new franchise the Baltimore Colts (after the unrelated previous team from the competing All-America Football Conference, which merged with the NFL in 1950).

The Colts do not claim the history of the Texans and their predecessors as their own, despite the Colts&#x27; inaugural roster including many of the players from the 1952 Texans, plus a number of players from the 1950-1951 Yanks.

As a result, the Texans are officially recognized as the last NFL team to permanently cease operations and not be included in the lineage of any current franchise.

===After the Texans===
Although the NFL rapidly grew more prosperous during the latter part of the 1950s (especially after the success of &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;, the 1958 Championship Game at Yankee Stadium between the vaunted New York Giants and the developing Colts, leading to a later profitable nationwide television contract), the 1952 debacle in Dallas left the NFL leery of further expansion.

Seeking a franchise in his home state and unable to persuade NFL owners to reconsider, Texas oil scion Lamar Hunt, with others, founded the American Football League as a direct competitor to the older NFL, with Hunt launching his own new Dallas Texans franchise.

Threatened by the new league and its impact upon attendances, player contract rates, and the television market, the NFL quickly reconsidered its position on expansion. A second venture into Dallas in 1960, establishing what would become a far more successful team, the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys&#x27; first game as a franchise would scheduled against the Steelers, eight years after the Steelers had voted against placing a team in Dallas. With fans in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex not forgetting this fact, combined with both teams being enormously successful in the following decades and establishing large fan bases in doing so, this would eventually lead to the Cowboys–Steelers rivalry.

Both franchises shared the Cotton Bowl stadium (also the home of Southern Methodist University&#x27;s (SMU) Mustangs)for their first three seasons. The Cowboys were even more woeful on the field in their inaugural season, enduring a winless season with an 0-11-1 record, and would not post a winning record until 1966, while the AFL Texans, after going .500 over their first two seasons in the new league, would capture the 1962 AFL Championship after defeating the cross-state rival Houston Oilers in double overtime. Both teams also initially struggled to draw enough fans to the Cotton Bowl to turn a profit. However, Texans owner Hunt and Cowboys owner Clint Murchison, Jr. were far better financed than the Millers had been, and also had the patience to absorb the massive losses.

Nevertheless, by the Texans&#x27; 1962 championship season, they were being consistently outdrawn at the gate by the Cowboys even though they had made a far better account of themselves on the field. Hunt realized that there was not nearly enough fan support or corporate support to support both teams. He relocated his team to Kansas City and rebranded them as the Chiefs, the second and last of two occasions that a professional American football champion has played the following season in another city. The other occasion was in 1945, with the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Rams. One month after winning the championship, franchise owner Dan Reeves, who had sustained five years of substantial financial losses, a situation that was exacerbated by poor home crowds and the pending arrival of the AAFC&#x27;s Browns (who were to commence play the next year), relocated the Rams to Los Angeles.

===Later use of the team name===

In 1974, the World Football League placed a team in Texas called the Houston Texans. The team transferred to Shreveport, Louisiana before the 1974 season was finished.

The Texans nickname was later revived by the NFL for the Houston Texans, an expansion team awarded in 2002 to fill the void left after the Oilers relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 1997, subsequently being rebranded as the Tennessee Titans.

==First round draft selection==

After Richter, a star at the University of California, made it clear he did not want to play for Dallas, he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, sending him closer to home. While the Rams sent a whopping eleven players to Dallas in exchange - still the second-biggest trade involving a single player in NFL history as of 2024 - the deal turned out to be very lopsided in the Rams&#x27; favor.

Richter went on to play nine seasons in Los Angeles and be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while of the eleven players sent to Dallas, defensive back/end Tom Keane was the only one of the eleven who lasted in the League beyond 1952, making All-Pro for the Baltimore Colts in 1953 before he retired in 1955. Of the remaining ten players, four did not last beyond the Texans&#x27; only season, and six never played another down of professional football.

<doc id="239585" wikidata="Q855119" url="?curid=239585" title="Shaolin kung fu">
<text>Shaolin kung fu (), also called Shaolin Wushu (), or Shaolin quan (), is the largest and most famous style of kung fu. It combines Chan philosophy and martial arts. 
It was developed in the Shaolin Temple in Henan, China during its 1500-year history. In Chinese folklore there is a saying, &quot;Shaolin kung fu is the best under heaven,&quot; which indicates its superiority among martial arts, and &quot;All martial arts under heaven originated from Shaolin,&quot; which indicates its influence on other martial arts. The name &quot;Shaolin&quot; is also used as a brand for the external styles of kung fu. Many styles in southern and northern China use the name Shaolin.
==History==

===Chinese martial arts before Shaolin===
Chinese historical records, like &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue&quot;, the &quot;Bibliographies in the Book of the Han Dynasty,&quot; the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian,&quot; and other sources document the existence of martial arts in China for thousands of years. For example, the Chinese martial art of wrestling, &quot;Shuai Jiao&quot;, predates the establishment of Shaolin temple by several centuries. Since Chinese monasteries were large landed estates that made a considerable regular income, monks required some form of protection. Historical discoveries indicate that, even before the establishment of Shaolin temple, monks had been armed and also practiced martial arts. In 1784 the &quot;Boxing Classic: Essential Boxing Methods&quot; made the earliest extant reference to the Shaolin Monastery as Chinese boxing&#x27;s place of origin. This is, however, a misconception, but even the fact that such a mistake could be made helps to show the historical importance of Shaolin kung fu.

===Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589 AD)===

====Shaolin temple established====

In 495 AD, Shaolin temple was built among the Song mountains in Henan province. The first monk who preached Buddhism there was the monk named Buddhabhadra (), simply called Batuo () by the Chinese. There are historical records that Batuo&#x27;s first Chinese disciples, Huiguang () and Sengchou (), both had exceptional martial skills. For example, Sengchou&#x27;s skill with the tin staff and empty-hand strikes is even documented in the Chinese Buddhist canon.

====Bodhidharma&#x27;s influence====
Bodhidharma is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, and regarded as its first Chinese patriarch. In Japan, he is known as Daruma.

The idea that Bodhidharma founded martial arts at the Shaolin Temple was spread in the 20th century, however, this idea came from a debunked apocryphal 17th century legend that claimed Bodhidharma taught the monks philosophies of Chan Buddhism, in which the monks were then able to use these philosophies to create their own combat techniques of Shaolin kung fu. The idea of Bodhidharma influencing Shaolin boxing is based on a Qigong manual written during the 17th century. This is when a Taoist with the pen name &#x27;Purple Coagulation Man of the Way&#x27; wrote the &quot;Sinews Changing Classic&quot; in 1624, but claimed to have discovered it. The first of two prefaces of the manual traces this succession from Bodhidharma to the Chinese general Li Jing via &quot;a chain of Buddhist saints and martial heroes.&quot; The work itself is full of anachronistic mistakes and even includes a popular character from Chinese fiction, the &#x27;Qiuran Ke&#x27; (&#x27;Bushy Bearded Hero&#x27;) (), as a lineage master. Scholar-officials as far back as the Qing dynasty have taken note of these mistakes. The scholar Ling Tinkang (1757–1809) described the author as an &quot;ignorant village master.&quot; Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904–1907 serialization of the novel &quot;The Travels of Lao Ts&#x27;an&quot; in &quot;Illustrated Fiction Magazine&quot;:
===Sui and Tang dynasties (581–907 AD): Shaolin soldier monks===
During the short period of the Sui dynasty (581–618), the building blocks of Shaolin kung fu took an official form, and Shaolin monks began to create fighting systems of their own. The 18 methods of Luohan with a strong Buddhist flavour were practiced by Shaolin monks since this time, which was later used to create more advanced Shaolin martial arts. Shaolin monks had developed very powerful martial skills, and this showed itself towards the end of the Sui dynasty.

Like most dynastic changes, the end of the Sui dynasty was a time of upheaval and contention for the throne. The oldest evidence of Shaolin participation in combat is a stele from 728 that attests to two occasions: a defense of the monastery from bandits around 610 and their role in the defeat of Wang Shichong at the Battle of Hulao in 621. Wang Shichong declared himself Emperor. He controlled the territory of Zheng and the ancient capital of Luoyang. Overlooking Luoyang on Mount Huanyuan was the Cypress Valley Estate, which had served as the site of a fort during the Jin and a commandery during the Southern Qi. Emperor Wen of Sui had bestowed the estate on a nearby monastery called Shaolin for its monks to farm, but Wang Shichong, realizing its strategic value, seized the estate and there placed troops and a signal tower, as well as establishing a prefecture called Yuanzhou. Furthermore, he had assembled an army at Luoyang to march on the Shaolin Temple itself.

The monks of Shaolin allied with Wang&#x27;s enemy, Li Shimin, and took back the Cypress Valley Estate, defeating Wang&#x27;s troops and capturing his nephew Renze. Without the fort at Cypress Valley, there was nothing to keep Li Shimin from marching on Luoyang after his defeat of Wang&#x27;s ally Dou Jiande at the Battle of Hulao, forcing Wang Shichong to surrender. Li Shimin&#x27;s father was the first Tang Emperor and Shimin himself became its second. Thereafter Shaolin enjoyed the royal patronage of the Tang.

Though the Shaolin Monastery Stele of 728 attests to these incidents in 610 and 621 when the monks engaged in combat, it does not allude to martial training in the monastery, or to any fighting technique in which its monks specialized. Nor do any other sources from the Tang, Song and Yuan periods allude to military training at the temple. According to Meir Shahar, this is explained by a confluence of the late Ming fashion for military encyclopedias and, more importantly, the conscription of civilian irregulars, including monks, as a result of Ming military decline in the 16th century.
Stele and documentary evidence shows the monks historically worshiped the Bodhisattva Vajrapani&#x27;s &quot;Kinnara King&quot; form as the progenitor of their staff and bare hand fighting styles.

===Ming dynasty (1368–1644)===
From the 8th to the 15th centuries, no extant source documents Shaolin participation in combat; then the 16th and 17th centuries see at least forty extant sources attest that, not only did monks of Shaolin practice martial arts, but martial practice had become such an integral element of Shaolin monastic life that the monks felt the need to justify it by creating new Buddhist lore. References to Shaolin martial arts appear in various literary genres of the late Ming:
the epitaphs of Shaolin warrior monks, martial-arts manuals, military encyclopedias, historical writings, travelogues, fiction, and even poetry.

These sources, in contrast to those from the Tang dynasty period, refer to Shaolin methods of combat unarmed, with the spear, and with the weapon that was the forte of the Shaolin monks and for which they had become famous, the staff. By the mid-16th century military experts from all over Ming China were travelling to Shaolin to study its fighting techniques.

Around 1560 Yu Dayou travelled to Shaolin Monastery to see for himself its monks&#x27; fighting techniques, but found them disappointing. Yú returned to the south with two monks, Zongqing and Pucong, whom he taught the use of the staff over the next three years, after which Zongqing and Pucong returned to Shaolin Monastery and taught their brother monks what they had learned. Martial arts historian Tang Hao traced the Shaolin staff style Five Tigers Interception to Yú&#x27;s teachings.

The earliest extant manual on Shaolin kung fu, the &quot;Exposition of the Original Shaolin Staff Method&quot; was written in around 1610 and published in 1621 from what its author Chéng Zōngyóu learned during a more than ten-year stay at the monastery.

Conditions of lawlessness in Henan—where the Shaolin Monastery is located—and surrounding provinces during the late Ming dynasty and all of the Qing dynasty contributed to the development of martial arts.
Meir Shahar lists the martial arts tai chi, Chang Family Boxing, Baguaquan, Xingyi quan and bajiquan as originating from this region and this time period.

====Pirates====

From the 1540s to the 1560s, pirates known as &quot;wokou&quot; raided China&#x27;s eastern and southeastern coasts on an unprecedented scale.

The geographer Zheng Ruoceng provides the most detailed of the 16th-century sources which confirm that, in 1553, Wan Biao, Vice Commissioner in Chief of the Nanjing Chief Military Commission, initiated the conscription of monks—including some from Shaolin—against the pirates. Warrior monks participated in at least four battles: at the Hangzhou Bay in spring 1553 and in the Huangpu River delta at Wengjiagang in July 1553, Majiabang in spring 1554, and Taozhai in autumn 1555.

The monks suffered their greatest defeat at Taozhai, where four of them fell in battle; their remains were buried under the Stūpa of the Four Heroic Monks (&quot;Si yi seng ta&quot;) at Mount She near Shanghai.

The monks won their greatest victory at Wengjiagang. On 21 July 1553, 120 warrior monks led by the Shaolin monk Tianyuan defeated a group of pirates and chased the survivors over ten days and twenty miles. The pirates suffered over one hundred casualties and the monks only four.

Not all of the monks who fought at Wengjiagang were from Shaolin, and rivalries developed among them. Zheng chronicles Tianyuan&#x27;s defeat of eight rival monks from Hangzhou who challenged his command. Zheng ranked Shaolin first of the top three Buddhist centers of martial arts. Zheng ranked Funiu in Henan second and Mount Wutai in Shanxi third. The Funiu monks practiced staff techniques which they had learned at the Shaolin Monastery. The Wutai monks practiced Yang Family Spear (楊家槍; pinyin: Yángjiā qiāng).

==Contents==

There is a famous saying that kung fu trains both the body and mind.

===Body exercises===
Body building exercises improve body abilities, including flexibility, balance, hardness, power, speed, and control of the body. These exercises are altogether called the &quot;72 arts&quot; in the folklore. However the actual exercises are not actually countable.

===Mind exercises===
Combat skills (), including techniques, tactics, and strategies for barehanded, weapon, and barehanded vs. weapon situations.

====Combat Techniques====
Kung fu teaches techniques for both defense and offense. Defensive techniques are mostly four types, dodge, block, catch, and parry, and offensive techniques are feint, hit, lock, and throw. Shaolin kung fu teaches all these types of techniques.
In kung fu, techniques are taught via two-person practices. In these practices, one party attacks and the other defends or counters or stands in posture for the other party to perform the technique. In Shaolin kung fu, in addition, two-person forms are taught. In these two-person forms, attacks and defenses are performed one after the other. Each technique is followed by its counter, and the counter by its counter, and so on. These forms ensure perfect memorization and exact transmission of the techniques from generation to generation.

====Combat Styles====
In addition to techniques, kung fu styles teach tactics. Tactics govern combination of techniques for better results. Because tactics are not specific techniques, they could not specifically be pre-coded into two-person practices and forms. In Shaolin kung fu, tactics are taught via solo forms (). Every form teaches some related tactics, which altogether shape a strategy. In Shaolin, closely related forms are coupled together, and these couples are called the small and the big forms, like the small and big hong quan, which altogether make the Shaolin hong quan style, and the small and big pao quan, etc. There are also some styles with one form, like taizu chang quan. These styles each teach a unique strategy.

Shaolin kung fu has more than hundreds of extant styles. There is recorded documentation of more than a thousand extant forms, which makes Shaolin the biggest school of martial art in the world. In the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Shaolin monks chose 100 of the best styles of Shaolin kung fu. Then they shortlisted the 18 most famous of them. However, every lineage of Shaolin monks have always chosen their own styles. Every style teaches unique methods for fighting () and keeping health via one or a few forms. To learn a complete system, Shaolin monks master a number of styles and weapons. The most famous styles of Shaolin kung fu are:

* Arhat&#x27;s 18 hands (): known as the oldest style.
* Flood style (): with the small form () known as the son of the styles, and the big form () known as the mother of the styles,
* 7-star &amp; Long Guard the Heart and Mind Gate style (),
* Explosive style (): known as the king of the styles,
* Penetrating-Arms style (),
* Plum Blossom style (),
* Facing &amp; Bright Sun style (),
* Arhat style (): known as the most representative style,
* Emperor&#x27;s Long-range style (): known as the most graceful style,
* Drunken style (),

and many other styles.

===Internal and external kung fu===
Huang Zongxi described martial arts in terms of Shaolin or &quot;external&quot; arts versus Wudang or &quot;internal&quot; arts in 1669. It has been since then that Shaolin has been popularly synonymous for what are considered the external Chinese martial arts, regardless of whether or not the particular style in question has any connection to the Shaolin Monastery. Some say that there is no differentiation between the so-called internal and external systems of the Chinese martial arts, while other well-known teachers hold the opinion that they are different. For example, the Taijiquan teacher Wu Jianquan:

Those who practice Shaolinquan leap about with strength and force; people not proficient at this kind of training soon lose their breath and are exhausted. Taijiquan is unlike this. Strive for quiescence of body, mind and intention.

==Influence on other martial arts==
Some lineages of karate have oral traditions that claim Shaolin origins. Martial arts traditions in Japan,
Korea, Sri Lanka and certain Southeast Asian countries cite Chinese influence as transmitted by Buddhist monks.

Recent developments in the 20th century such as Shorinji Kempo () practised in Japan&#x27;s &quot;Sohonzan Shorinji&quot; () still maintains close ties with China&#x27;s Song Shan Shaolin Temple due to historic links. Japanese Shorinji Kempo Group received recognition in China in 2003 for their financial contributions to the maintenance of the historic edifice of the Song Shan Shaolin Temple.

==In popular culture==

Several films have been produced, particularly during the 70s and early 80s, about Shaolin kung fu. Films such as 36th Chamber of Shaolin, The Shaolin Temple, and Shaolin Wooden Men. Modern films include Shaolin Soccer and Shaolin.

Shaolin has influenced numerous rappers, notably the members of Wu-Tang Clan.

Shaolin kung fu is one of the styles used by Mortal Kombat protagonist Liu Kang. His Pao Chui, Choy Lay Fut, Monkey Fist, and Dragon moves derive from Shaolin kung fu. 

Shaolin monks (referred to simply as &quot;monks&quot; in-game) appear in the roguelike game NetHack, along with samurai. They are one of the two roles to use martial arts skills, with monks having the most powerful martial arts skills in the game.

In the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;&quot;, the practice of &quot;firebending&quot; is based on Shaolin moves.

The ABC TV series &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (1972-1974) starring David Carradine as a fugitive Shaolin monk traveling the Western United States in search of his brother helped to popularize Shaolin Kung Fu with the general American TV audience.

<doc id="239587" wikidata="Q132863" url="?curid=239587" title="Finding Nemo">
<text>Finding Nemo is a 2003 American animated comedy-drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The film was directed by Andrew Stanton, co-directed by Lee Unkrich, and produced by Graham Walters, from a screenplay written by Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds, based on a story by Stanton. The film stars the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, and Geoffrey Rush. It tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin (Brooks) who, along with a forgetful regal blue tang named Dory (DeGeneres), searches for his missing son Nemo (Gould). Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.

Pre-production of the film began in 1997. The inspiration for &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; sprang from multiple experiences, going back to Stanton&#x27;s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. Thomas Newman composed the score for the film.

First premiering at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on May 18, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was released in theaters in the United States on May 30. Upon its release, it received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the visual elements, screenplay, animation, Newman&#x27;s score and characters that have been cited as funny to both young moviegoers and their parents. It became the highest-grossing animated film at the time of its release, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2003, earning a total of $871 million worldwide by the end of its initial theatrical run. The film received four nominations at the 76th Academy Awards, and won the award for Best Animated Feature, becoming the first Pixar and Disney film to do so.

&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is the best-selling DVD title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold , and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar&#x27;s own &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; overtook it. The film was re-released in 3D in 2012. In 2008, the American Film Institute named it as the 10th greatest American animated film as part of their 10 Top 10 lists. A sequel, &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, was released in June 2016.

==Plot==

Marlin and Coral, a clownfish couple, live happily in an anemone in the Great Barrier Reef. They are about to become parents, waiting for their many eggs to hatch. Suddenly, a barracuda approaches the anemone; Coral rushes to protect her eggs as the barracuda knocks Marlin unconscious. Upon awakening, Marlin discovers that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda; the last remaining egg is cracked. Marlin names his child Nemo, a name Coral liked, and vows to keep him safe.

On Nemo&#x27;s first day of school, he and Marlin have a heated argument regarding Marlin&#x27;s overprotective parenting method. Nemo defiantly swims to a speedboat and is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin frantically pursues the boat in vain. Marlin meets Dory, a blue tang with short-term memory loss, who offers to help him. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who are attempting to abstain from eating fish. Marlin finds a diver&#x27;s mask that fell from the boat and accidentally injures Dory with it. The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a frenzy and he accidentally sets off old naval mines; the sharks, Marlin, and Dory are able to swim to safety before the mines blow up.

Nemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney, Australia. He meets the &quot;Tank Gang&quot;, led by Gill, a scarred Moorish idol. Sherman plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla, who accidentally killed her previous pet fish because she treated him carelessly. Gill, who also wishes to return to the ocean, devises an escape plan: Nemo, the smallest fish in the tank, will block the aquarium&#x27;s filter tube with a pebble, obliging Sherman to put the fish into bags while he cleans the tank. This will allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to block the filter but fails; in the process, he is almost killed by the filter&#x27;s machinery, causing Gill to feel deeply regretful.

The diver&#x27;s mask falls into a deep trench. As Marlin and Dory search for it, they are attacked by an anglerfish but manage to trap it using the mask. Dory memorizes the address written on the mask. A school of moonfish give the pair directions to the East Australian Current. On their way, Marlin and Dory become trapped in a forest of jellyfish. After being stung and knocked unconscious, they awaken in the East Australian Current with a large group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. The story of Marlin&#x27;s quest is relayed by the turtles across the ocean to Sydney, where it reaches Nigel, a pelican who regularly converses with the Tank Gang. Nigel tells the Tank Gang of Marlin&#x27;s journey, motivating Nemo to try blocking the filter again. Nemo&#x27;s attempt is successful, and the aquarium quickly becomes covered in green algae.

After exiting the current, Marlin and Dory get lost and are consumed by a blue whale. The whale expels them through its blowhole into Sydney Harbour. Nigel finds Marlin and Dory, and, after rescuing them from a flock of ravenous seagulls, takes them to Sherman&#x27;s office, where Nemo is playing dead to avoid being given to Darla; this causes Marlin to believe Nemo is actually dead. Sherman forces Nigel out of his office, and Gill helps Nemo escape through the sink drain that leads to the ocean.

Deeply shaken, Marlin mournfully says goodbye to Dory and begins heading home. Nemo meets Dory, who helps him reunite with Marlin. A fishing trawler captures Dory in a net along with a school of groupers. Nemo and Marlin work together, instructing the fish to swim down. Their combined force breaks the beam of the trawler, freeing the fish. 

Some time later, Marlin, who has become more confident and outgoing, drops Nemo off at school. Dory joins Marlin, and together, they wave goodbye to Nemo as he leaves with his class. Meanwhile, after the dentist&#x27;s new filter breaks, the Tank Gang escapes into Sydney Harbour in their plastic bags. Now successfully in the ocean but still stuck in the bags, they ponder what to do next.

===Development===

The inspiration for &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director Andrew Stanton&#x27;s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.

In an interview with &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone:

In addition, clownfish are colorful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character. Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. As a result, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director Lee Unkrich called &quot;very unusual for an animated film&quot;. The artists took scuba diving lessons to study the coral reef.

Stanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie. The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he&#x27;s from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children&#x27;s storybook that shares exactly the same details.

===Casting===
William H. Macy was the first actor cast as Marlin. Although Macy had recorded most of the dialogue, Stanton felt that the character needed a lighter touch. Stanton then cast Albert Brooks in the role, and in his opinion, it &quot;saved&quot; the film. Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn&#x27;t funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.

The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Stanton and Bob Peterson while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast Ellen DeGeneres when he watched an episode of &quot;Ellen&quot; in which he saw her &quot;change the subject five times before finishing one sentence&quot;. The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald&#x27;s character was minimized.

Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film&#x27;s story reel and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton&#x27;s performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich&#x27;s office. Crush&#x27;s son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director Brad Bird. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was &quot;this generation&#x27;s Thumper&quot; and immediately cast Nicholas.

Megan Mullally was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were stunned to learn that the voice of her character Karen Walker on the television show &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.

===Animation===
To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii, and received in-house lectures from an ichthyologist. As a result, Pixar&#x27;s animator for Dory, Gini Cruz Santos, integrated &quot;the fish movement, human movement, and facial expressions to make them look and feel like real characters.&quot; Production designer Ralph Eggleston created pastel drawings to give the lighting crew led by Sharon Calahan ideas of how every scene in the film should be lit.

The Great white shark, Bruce, is in reference to the animatronic shark used in the Universal film &quot;Jaws&quot;. The shark they had used on set was nicknamed &quot;Bruce&quot; after Bruce Raiman, who was Steven Spielberg&#x27;s divorce lawyer. The line &quot;Here&#x27;s Brucey!&quot; is a reference to the Jack Nicholson line from the 1980 horror film, &quot;The Shining&quot;. Additionally, the music that plays for the dentist&#x27;s niece Darla is the theme music from the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film, &quot;Psycho&quot;.

The film was dedicated to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died of melanoma in October 2002. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; shares many plot elements with &quot;Pierrot the Clownfish&quot;, a children&#x27;s book published in 2002, but allegedly conceived in 1995. The author, Franck Le Calvez, sued Disney for infringement of his intellectual rights and to bar &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; merchandise in France. The judge ruled against him, citing the color differences between Pierrot and Nemo.

=== Localization ===

In 2016, Disney Character Voices International&#x27;s senior vice president Rick Dempsey, in collaboration with the Navajo Nation Museum, created a Navajo dubbing of the movie titled &quot;Nemo Há’déést’íí&quot; which was released in theaters March 18–24 of the same year. The project was thought as a means to preserve Navajo language, teaching the language to kids through a Disney movie. The studio held auditions on the reservation, but finding an age-appropriate native speaker to voice Nemo was hard, Dempsey said, as the majority of native Navajo speakers are over 40 years old. The end credits version of the song &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, covered in the English version by Robbie Williams, was also adapted into Navajo, with Fall Out Boy&#x27;s lead singer Patrick Stump performing it. In 2016, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was the second movie to receive a dub in Navajo, after &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was the first Pixar film not to be scored by Randy Newman. The original soundtrack album was instead scored by Thomas Newman, his cousin, and released on May 20, 2003. The score was nominated for the Academy Award for Original Score, losing to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.

==Release==
===Marketing===
Disney released a teaser trailer of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in June 2002, being first attached to the theatrical release of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. The teaser was later attached to the theatrical screenings of Hey Arnold!: The Movie, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The teaser was also attached to the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; home video release and other Disney home video releases. The next trailer for the film was released in October 2002 and was attached to the theatrical screenings of &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot;. The third trailer for the film was released in February 2003 and was attached to the theatrical screening of &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;. The fourth and final trailer for the film was released in March 2003 and was attached to the theatrical screening of &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot;.

McDonald&#x27;s restaurants began to sell eight Happy Meal toys based on the film. At the 100th North American International Toy Fair event in New York City, Hasbro unveiled a variety of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; toys. A cereal themed to the film was released by Kellogg&#x27;s, consisting of naturally sweetened oats with fish-shaped marshmallows. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was advertised as promotional partners on other companies, like Frito-Lay, Keebler, Pepsi, Ralphs, Dreyer&#x27;s, Jel Sert, Airheads, Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s, and THQ. Before May 26, 2003, stickers on over 50 million bags of potato chips alerted consumers to a sweepstakes dangling a trip for four to Sydney, Australia with a visit to the Great Barrier Reef. On May 17, 2003, Frito-Lay hosted an event at each of the Walmart stores, where kids could use 3D goggles to find hidden images of Nemo. Kellogg&#x27;s packed eight different water toys depicting film characters inside Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Honey Smacks and Cocoa Rice Krispies cereal boxes. The Honey Smacks, Frosted Flakes, Cinnamon Crunch Crispix and Froot Loops boxes also carried a Nemo memory card game on back panels. Plus, a Nemo-themed Marshmallow Froot Loops cereal featured four of the film&#x27;s characters. Consumers could mail in two UPCs from the three Kellogg&#x27;s cereals to receive a large beach towel. Besides this, the company unveiled a new type of Pop-Tarts inspired by &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. Known as the Great Berry Reef Pop-Tarts, they had a wild berry filling and fish sprinkles. A pool raft was available with two Pop-Tart UPCs and shipping, handled by Draft Worldwide of Chicago. Eggo waffles would offer holographic swimming goggles with the purchase of two of its products with shipping and handling. For their snacks division, Kellogg&#x27;s offered consumers who purchased two packages of select products and two gallons of milk with a giant inflatable shark. The company advertised the film on Vanilla Wafers, Chips Deluxe, Mini Fudge Shoppe Fudge Stripes, Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies, Rice Krispies Treats and limited edition Nemo-themed cookies.

On May 20, 2003, Kellogg&#x27;s recalled Frosted Flakes cereal boxes due to their extremely close resemblance of a Hasbro memory card game. A lawsuit was filed against the company, which included a full-page reproduction of the front of a Frosted Flakes box with the cereal&#x27;s familiar Tony the Tiger mascot grinning next to Nemo, Dory and Crush from the film. Disney had licensed the characters to use on the game cards. Hasbro had filed the suit to protect its trademark against blatant infringement.

===Theatrical===
&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was not only the fifth Pixar film, but was also the first one to be released during the summer instead of November, much like its four predecessors. The film premiered in Los Angeles on May 18, 2003, and opened in theaters with &quot;The Italian Job&quot; and &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; on May 30, 2003.

===Home media===
&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on November 4, 2003, both THX-certified and taken from the digital source. The film&#x27;s 2-disc Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD release sold more than 8 million copies on its first day of release, breaking &quot;Spider-Man&quot;″s record for having the highest single-day DVD sales. It also surpassed &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; for having the highest single-day record for an animated movie. Within two weeks, it went on to become the best-selling DVD of its time, selling over 15 million copies and beating &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. With over 40 million copies sold, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; currently holds the record for the best-selling DVD release of all time. The first disc features a widescreen version, documentaries, galleries and an audio/visual commentary, and the second disc features a full-frame version, games, sneak peeks of other films (including &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and &quot;Home on the Range&quot;), bonus shorts (&quot;Knick Knack&quot;, which was shown alongside the film in theaters, and &quot;Exploring the Reef&quot;), and the advertising campaign. Both discs also feature introductions from Stanton and Unkrich and &quot;virtual aquariums&quot; based on the film&#x27;s various settings.

The film was then released on both Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray on December 4, 2012, with both a 3-disc and a 5-disc set. In 2019, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray.

It was the second-highest-grossing film of 2003, behind &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; also defeated &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; to become the highest-grossing film of the 2003 summer season. The film sold an estimated 56.4 million tickets in the United States during its initial theatrical run.

On its opening weekend, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; earned $70.6 million in the United States and Canada. When the film opened, it was ranked number one at the box office, dethroning &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; and &quot;The Italian Job&quot;. Additionally, it surpassed its predecessor &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; for having the highest domestic opening weekend for an animated film. It would hold this record until &quot;Shrek 2&quot; took it the following year. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a 2003 film at the time of its release, behind &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;X2&quot;.

Nevertheless, the film returned to the number one spot the following week. At that point, it earned $29.2 million, bringing the total domestic gross to $192.3 million. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was the first film to reclaim the number one spot since &quot;Die Another Day&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; in 2002. It would also outgross the weaker openings of &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; and &quot;Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd&quot;. By the film&#x27;s 20th day of release, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; had earned over $200 million. During the film&#x27;s fourth weekend, it was overtaken by &quot;Hulk&quot;.

By July 2003, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; had earned $274.9 million, beating &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and becoming the top-grossing movie of the year. The film even surpassed &quot;Shrek&quot; to become the second highest-grossing animated film. Later that month, the film had earned over $300 million, becoming the highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada, surpassing &quot;The Lion King&quot;. By the end of the summer season, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was one of five films to reach $200 million at the box office in a single summer season, with the others being &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; and Disney&#x27;s own &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. At the end of its theatrical run, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; grossed $339.7 million in the United States and Canada and $531.3 million in international territories, totaling $871.0 million worldwide. In all three occasions, it had outgrossed &quot;The Lion King&quot; to become the highest-grossing animated film. It stayed in the Top 10 until August 14 (11 weeks total). In North America, it was surpassed by both &quot;Shrek 2&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; in 2010. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; would hold the record for having the highest international gross for an animated film until 2009 when it was taken by &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs&quot;. Outside North America, it stands as the fifth highest-grossing animated film. Worldwide, it currently ranks as the ninth highest-grossing animated film. Moreover, it was the highest-grossing Disney film for three years before &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; surpassed it. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was also the fourth animated film to make $500 million worldwide, joining &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

The film had impressive box office runs in many international markets. In Japan, its highest-grossing market after North America, it grossed ¥11.2 billion ($102.4 million), becoming the highest-grossing foreign animated film in local currency (yen). It has only been surpassed by &quot;Frozen&quot; (¥25.5 billion). Plus, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was the second film by Buena Vista Pictures to reach $100 million in the country, just after &quot;Armageddon&quot; in 1999. In Mexico, it earned $4.7 million, making it the country&#x27;s second-highest opening weekend, behind &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. The film also grossed £37.2 million ($67.1 million) in the U.K., Ireland, and Malta. At the Manchester UCI Cinemas, it made a total three-day opening gross of £17,150 ($28,583), becoming the theater&#x27;s highest-grossing digital film at the time, surpassing &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; and numerous other releases. Making £28.7 million ($35.7 million), &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was the highest-grossing film released in October 2003 in the region, beating &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;. Following in biggest grosses are France and the Maghreb region ($64.8 million), Germany ($53.9 million), and Spain ($29.5 million).

====3D re-release====
After the success of the 3D re-release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Disney re-released &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in 3D on September 14, 2012, with a conversion cost estimated to be below $5 million. For the opening weekend of its 3D re-release in North America, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; grossed $16.7 million, debuting at the No. 2 spot behind &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot;.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Breathtakingly lovely and grounded by the stellar efforts of a well-chosen cast, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; adds another beautifully crafted gem to Pixar&#x27;s crown.&quot; Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 38 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of &quot;A+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, calling it &quot;one of those rare movies where I wanted to sit in the front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision&quot;. Ed Park of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying &quot;It&#x27;s an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;.&quot; Mark Caro of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, saying &quot;You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure.&quot; Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying &quot;As gorgeous a film as Disney&#x27;s ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy.&quot; Beth Jones of &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot; gave &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; a five out of five rating, explaining that &quot;several scenes are scarier than Edward Norton&#x27;s mustache in &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.&quot; Jeff Strickler of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying it &quot;proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days.&quot; Gene Seymour of &quot;Newsday&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying &quot;The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They&#x27;re so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching.&quot; Rene Rodriguez of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, saying &quot;Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children&#x27;s films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of five, saying &quot;The best break of all is that Pixar&#x27;s traditionally untethered imagination can&#x27;t be kept under wraps forever, and &quot;Nemo&quot; erupts with sea creatures that showcase Stanton and company&#x27;s gift for character and peerless eye for skewering contemporary culture.&quot; Sandra Hall of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said, &quot;This is not the first time Pixar&#x27;s animators have been engaged with the natural world, but they&#x27;ve never been as deeply immersed as they are in this undersea &quot;Fantasia&quot;.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, saying &quot;Visual imagination and sophisticated wit raise &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; to a level just below the peaks of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;.&quot; Terry Lawson of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; gave the film three out of four, saying &quot;As we now expect from Pixar, even the supporting fish in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; are more developed as characters than any human in the &quot;&quot; movies.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three and half out of four, saying &quot;&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is an undersea treasure. The most gorgeous of all the Pixar films—which include &quot;Toy Story&quot; 1 and 2, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;—Nemo treats family audiences to a sweet, resonant story and breathtaking visuals. It may lack &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;″s clever humor, but kids will identify with the spunky sea fish Nemo, and adults will relate to Marlin, Nemo&#x27;s devoted dad.&quot; Bruce Westbrook of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; gave the film an A−, saying &quot;&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; lives up to Pixar&#x27;s high standards for wildly creative visuals, clever comedy, solid characters and an involving story.&quot; Jack Garner of &quot;Gannett News Service&quot; gave it a score of ten out of ten, stating that the film &quot;strikes the perfect balance between the charm and childlike innocence of Disney animation and the cutting-edge humor and hipness of the old Warner Brothers cartoons.&quot; Tom Long of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; gave the film an A−, saying &quot;A simple test of humanity: If you don&#x27;t laugh aloud while watching it, you&#x27;ve got a battery not a heart.&quot;

Moira MacDonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; gave the film four out of four, saying &quot;Enchanting; written with an effortless blend of sweetness and silliness, and animated with such rainbow-hued beauty, you may find yourself wanting to freeze-frame it.&quot; Daphne Gordon of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; gave the film four out of five, saying &quot;One of the strongest releases from Disney in years, thanks to the work of Andrew Stanton, possibly one of the most successful directors you&#x27;ve never heard of.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; gave the film three and a half out of four, saying &quot;&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; isn&#x27;t quite up there with the company&#x27;s finest work—there&#x27;s finally a sense of formula setting in—but it&#x27;s hands down the best family film since &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;&quot; C.W. Nevius of &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film four out of four, saying &quot;The visuals pop, the fish emote and the ocean comes alive. That&#x27;s in the first two minutes. After that, they do some really cool stuff.&quot; Gregory M. Lamb of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; gave the film a rating of three out of four, calling it &quot;the best animated underwater picture since &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.&quot; Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying &quot;&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; will engross kids with its absorbing story, brightly drawn characters and lively action, and grown-ups will be equally entertained by the film&#x27;s subtle humor and the sophistication of its visuals.&quot; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying &quot;A visual marvel, every frame packed to the gills with clever details, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is the best big-studio release so far this year.&quot;

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying &quot;Nemo, with its ravishing underwater fantasia, manages to trump the design glamour of earlier Pixar films.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an A, saying &quot;In this seamless blending of technical brilliance and storytelling verve, the Pixar team has made something as marvelously soulful and innately, fluidly American as jazz.&quot; Carrie Rickey of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; gave the film three out of four, saying &quot;As eye-popping as Nemo&#x27;s peepers and as eccentric as this little fish with asymmetrical fins.&quot; David Germain of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying &quot;&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is laced with smart humor and clever gags, and buoyed by another cheery story of mismatched buddies: a pair of fish voiced by Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres.&quot; Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying &quot;The latest flood of wizardry from Pixar, whose productions, from &quot;Toy Story&quot; onward, have lent an indispensable vigor and wit to the sagging art of mainstream animation.&quot; The 3D re-release prompted a retrospective on the film nine years after its initial release. Stephen Whitty of &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; described it as &quot;a genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic.&quot; On the 3D re-release, Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that its emotional power was deepened by &quot;the dimensionality of the oceanic deep&quot; where &quot;the spatial mysteries of watery currents and floating worlds are exactly where 3D explorers were born to boldly go&quot;.

&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was included on a number of best-of lists. The film appeared on professional rankings from BBC and &quot;The Independent&quot; based on retrospective appraisal, as one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century. Several publications have listed it as one of the best animated films, including: &quot;IGN&quot; (2010), &quot;Insider&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot; (all 2018), &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;Complex&quot;, and &quot;Time Out New York&quot; (all 2021). In December 2021, the film&#x27;s screenplay was listed number 60 on the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s &quot;101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)&quot;.

In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot;, the best 10 films in 10 &quot;classic&quot; American film genres, after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was acknowledged as the 10th best film in the animation genre. It was the most recently released film among all 10 lists, and one of only three movies made after the year 2000 (the others being &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;Shrek&quot;).

American Film Institute recognition:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies – Nominated
* AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 – No. 10 Animated film

===Environmental concerns and consequences===
The film&#x27;s use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the fish breed as pets in the United States, even though the story portrayed the use of fish as pets negatively and suggested that saltwater aquariums are notably tricky and expensive to maintain. The demand for clownfish was supplied by large-scale harvesting of tropical fish in regions like Vanuatu. The Australian Tourism Commission (ATC) launched several marketing campaigns in China and the United States to improve tourism in Australia, many of them utilizing &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; clips. Queensland used &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; to draw tourists to promote itself to vacationers. According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;Ironically, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, a movie about the anguish of a captured clownfish, caused home-aquarium demand for them to triple.&quot;

The reaction to the film by the general public has led to environmental devastation for the clownfish, and has provoked an outcry from several environmental protection agencies, including the Marine Aquarium Council, Australia. The demand for tropical fish skyrocketed after the film&#x27;s release, causing reef species decimation in Vanuatu and several other reef areas. After seeing the film, some aquarium owners released their pet fish into the ocean, but failed to release them into the correct oceanic habitat, which introduced species that are harmful to the indigenous environment, a practice that is harming reefs worldwide.

A 2017 study by researchers from James Cook University in Australia found little evidence for fan-based purchases of wild-caught fish immediately (within 1.5 years of release) following the film.

==Legacy==
=== Sequel ===

A spin-off sequel to this film was released in June 2016, titled &quot;Finding Dory&quot;. It focuses on Dory having a journey to reunite with her parents (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy). Like the previous film, &quot;Finding Dory&quot; was a financial success and fared well with critics.

===Video games===

A video game based on the film was released in 2003, for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. The goal of the game is to complete different levels under the roles of Nemo, Marlin or Dory. It includes cut scenes from the movie, and each clip is based on a level. It was also the last Pixar game developed by Traveller&#x27;s Tales. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews. A Game Boy Advance sequel, titled &quot;Finding Nemo: The Continuing Adventures&quot;, was released in 2004.

===Theme park attractions===
&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; has inspired numerous attractions and properties at Disney Parks around the world, including: Turtle Talk with Crush, which opened in 2004 at Epcot, 2005 in Disney California Adventure Park, 2008 in Hong Kong Disneyland, and 2009 in Tokyo DisneySea; Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, which opened in 2007 in Disneyland Park; The Seas with Nemo &amp; Friends, which opened in 2007 at Epcot; &quot;Finding Nemo – The Musical&quot;, which opened in 2007 in Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom; and Crush&#x27;s Coaster, which opened in 2007 at Walt Disney Studios Park.

<doc id="239589" wikidata="Q1160005" url="?curid=239589" title="The Birdcage">
<text>The Birdcage is a 1996 American comedy film produced and directed by Mike Nichols. Elaine May&#x27;s screenplay adapted the 1978 French film &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, itself an adaptation of a 1973 play. It stars Robin Williams and Nathan Lane as a gay couple whose son (Dan Futterman) is set to marry the daughter (Calista Flockhart) of a conservative senator (Gene Hackman) and his wife (Dianne Wiest). Hank Azaria and Christine Baranski appear in supporting roles. The film marked the first screen collaboration of Nichols and May, who had been a comedy duo in the 1950s and 1960s.

&quot;The Birdcage&quot; was released on March 8, 1996, to positive reviews and significant commercial success. It debuted at the top of the North American box office and stayed there for the following three weeks, grossing $185.3 million worldwide on a $31 million budget. It is seen as groundbreaking because it was one of few films from a major studio to feature LGBT characters at its center. The cast received notable praise and was awarded the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. &quot;The Birdcage&quot; also received a nomination for Best Art Direction at the 69th Academy Awards.

==Plot==
Armand Goldman is the openly gay owner of a drag club in South Beach called &quot;The Birdcage&quot;; his effete and flamboyant partner Albert is the star attraction of the club under the name Starina. They live together in an apartment above The Birdcage with Agador, an openly gay and equally flamboyant, Guatemalan housekeeper who aspires to be in Armand&#x27;s drag show.

Armand&#x27;s 20-year-old son Val, who is the product of Armand&#x27;s drunken one-night stand with a woman named Katharine, returns home to announce that he is engaged to be married to a young woman named Barbara. Although Armand and Albert are both less than happy about the news, they agree to support Val.

Barbara&#x27;s parents are the ultra-conservative Republican Senator Kevin Keeley, co-founder of a conservative group called the Coalition for Moral Order, and his wife Louise. Kevin initially opposes Barbara&#x27;s engagement. However, he soon becomes embroiled in a political scandal when the Coalition&#x27;s other co-founder and Kevin&#x27;s fellow senator is found dead in the bed of an underage Black prostitute. Louise convinces him that Barbara&#x27;s wedding will shore up his image as an upright family man, but the Senator is concerned that Val&#x27;s family will refuse to let it go ahead because of the scandal, and so insists that they cannot announce the engagement to the press until he&#x27;s spoken to Val&#x27;s parents and can be sure the wedding will go ahead. To this end, the Keeleys plan a visit to South Beach.

Barbara shares with Val news of her father&#x27;s plan. To conceal the truth about the Goldmans, she has told her parents that Armand is straight, named Coleman (to hide that they are Jewish) and is a cultural attaché to Greece. Armand dislikes the idea of being forced into the closet, but agrees to play along, enlisting the help of friends and club employees to redecorate the apartment to more closely resemble a traditional household. Val and Armand attempt to keep Albert out of the house, but when they fail, Albert suggests that he will pose as Val&#x27;s straight uncle. Armand contacts Katharine and explains the situation; she promises to come to the party and pretend to be his wife. Armand tries to coach Albert on how to act straight, but Albert&#x27;s flamboyant nature makes the task difficult. Armand realizes that his plan will not fool anyone. Albert takes offense and locks himself in his room.

The Keeleys arrive at the Goldmans&#x27; redecorated apartment; they are greeted by Agador, who is attempting to pass as a Greek butler named Spartacus for the night. Unfortunately, Katharine gets caught in traffic, and the Keeleys begin wondering where &quot;Mrs. Coleman&quot; is. Suddenly, Albert enters, dressed and styled as a conservative middle-aged woman. Armand, Val and Barbara are nervous, but Kevin and Louise are fooled by the disguise.

Despite the success of the evening, trouble begins when the senator&#x27;s chauffeur betrays him to two tabloid journalists, Harry Radman and his photographer, who have been hoping for a scoop on the Coalition story and have followed the Keeleys to South Beach. While they research The Birdcage, they also remove a note that Armand has left on the door informing Katharine not to come upstairs. When she arrives, she unknowingly reveals the deceptions, leading Val to confess to the scheme and finally identify Albert as his true parent.

Kevin is initially confused by the situation, but Louise informs him of the truth and scolds him for being more concerned with his career than his family&#x27;s happiness. When attempting to leave, he is ambushed by the paparazzi camped outside to take his picture. Albert realizes that there is a way for the family to escape without being recognized. He dresses them in drag, and they use the apartment&#x27;s back entrance to sneak into The Birdcage, where, by dancing to Sister Sledge&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot;, they make their way out of the nightclub without incident. Barbara and Val are married in an interfaith service that both families attend.

==Cast==
==Production==

Mike Nichols was originally involved as the director of the 1983 Broadway adaptation of &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, but was fired from the production by producer Allan Carr. In 1994, Nichols convinced John Calley, then the head of United Artists, who owned the rights to the original 1978 film version, to renew the option with him as a director and producer. Calley, a longtime friend of Nichols, said, &quot;I asked Mike if there was anything we owned that interested him. And he said, &#x27;You own a project that has one of the greatest comedy structures.&#x27; We got the rest of the rights, and he said he wanted to call Elaine and ask her to do it. The next day she said yes.&quot;

Among the changes that Elaine May added to the film&#x27;s plot was renaming the character of Georges to Armand and Albin to Albert. She also adapted the plot line about the potential in-law characters as a conservative Moral Majority politician and his wife, to address right-wing anti-LGBT sentiment that was in the news at that time.

Nichols envisioned Robin Williams and Steve Martin in the roles of Albert and Armand, respectively, but Martin turned it down because he did not think that he would be able to bring the camp quality required for the part, and Williams did not want to play Albert because he had already played a flamboyant character in &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;. When Williams decided that he wanted to play Armand, Nichols settled on Nathan Lane as Albert. Lane had already committed to starring in a Broadway production of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, but Nichols convinced producer Scott Rudin to postpone the musical so that Lane could star in the film. Gene Hackman said that taking a role in the cast was an opportunity for him to return to his improvisational comedy roots.

Nichols originally conceived of British actor Adrian Lester in the role of Agador, but reworked the role after he and Lester came to a mutual agreement that showing a Black person in the role of a housekeeper would connote racist undertones. Hank Azaria, who was eventually cast, said, &quot;I worked up different versions [of Agador]. One was more understated, barely obviously gay, almost a street tough. And one was the character that ended up in the movie. Both felt real to me—I had grown up with Puerto Rican street queens who were very effeminate and flamboyant and others who weren&#x27;t. I tried both versions out for a friend who was a drag queen, asked which one he liked better, and got his seal of approval.&quot;

Nichols did research for the film by traveling with May and production designer Bo Welch to drag shows in Chicago and Savannah. After going to a drag show in South Beach at Welch&#x27;s suggestion, Nichols decided to change the film&#x27;s setting from New Orleans to South Beach.

Williams and Lane, both known for being comic improvisers, were allowed to improvise during weeks-long rehearsals before filming. Nichols and May took the best parts from the rehearsals because Nichols wanted to shoot the film like a play, without too much editing.

Although filming primarily took place in Los Angeles, exterior shots included the Carlyle Hotel in Miami Beach, Ocean Drive, and the Art Deco District.

Although the studio had initial reservations about the film&#x27;s politics, particularly its portrayal of conservative characters, Calley said, &quot;Mike anticipated [the concerns] eight or nine months ago. He said, &#x27;By the time the movie comes out, you won&#x27;t be able to parody these guys anymore; they&#x27;ll be parodying themselves.&#x27;&quot;

==Soundtrack==
 
Three songs written by Stephen Sondheim were adapted and arranged for the film by composer Jonathan Tunick. Albert&#x27;s first song (as Starina) is &quot;Can That Boy Foxtrot&quot;, cut from Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;. &quot;Little Dream&quot; was written specifically for the film, ultimately used during Albert&#x27;s rehearsal with the gum-chewing dancer. While Armand and Katharine dance in her office, they sing &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot;, cut from &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.&quot;

In addition to Sondheim&#x27;s contributions, Tunick utilized popular dance and disco hits, such as Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;She Works Hard for the Money&quot; and Sister Sledge&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot;, along with Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine&#x27;s &quot;Conga&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Birdcage&quot; opened on March 8, 1996, and earned $18,275,828 in its opening weekend, topping the box office. It remained on top for the next three weeks before being derailed by &quot;Primal Fear&quot; and &quot;A Thin Line Between Love and Hate.&quot; By the end of its 14-week run, the film had grossed $124,060,553 domestically and $61,200,000 internationally, eventually reaching a worldwide total of $185,260,553.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Birdcage&quot; received positive reviews on release. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 84% approval score, based on reviews from 62 critics, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Mike Nichols wrangles agreeably amusing performances from Robin Williams and Nathan Lane in this fun, if not quite essential, remake of the French-Italian comedy &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;.&quot; Metacritic reports a score of 72/100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three stars out of four, writing that while the material will be familiar to those who have seen the original 1978 film or its Broadway incarnation, &quot;what makes Mike Nichols&#x27;[s] version more than just a retread is good casting in the key roles, and a wicked screenplay by Elaine May, who keeps the original story but adds little zingers here and there (&#x27;Live on Fisher Island and get buried in Palm Beach - that way you&#x27;ll get the best of Florida!&#x27;)&quot;.

In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson noted the film&#x27;s subversiveness, commenting, &quot;While politicians like Keeley talk a good game of family values, it&#x27;s Armand and his nontraditional clan who have the stable home life. They are a family.&quot;

Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the film as &quot;a spirited remake of the French drag farce [that] has everything in place, from eyeliner to one-liner&quot;.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the film &quot;Enchantingly witty&quot;.

In &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy called the movie &quot;a scream&quot;, adding, &quot;Just as in their routines when they were a team in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Nichols and May are at their best with political and cultural humor. A reactionary politician is an easy target, of course, but the digs at Hackman&#x27;s public image-obsessed senator are relentlessly clever and on the mark, as are the jibes at unscrupulous journalists. Final exchange of dialogue, involving Hackman&#x27;s character, brings down the house in the manner of the famous &#x27;nobody&#x27;s perfect&#x27; line in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;.&quot; McCarthy concluded, &quot;Lane has all the showy opportunities as the ultra-feminine Albert, and this outstanding Broadway star, little seen up to now in films, makes the most of them, mincing, pouting, posing and cavorting to hilarious and heartwarming effect. Although the gay lifestyles on display here are decidedly old school, the characters&#x27; underlying fierce pride, along with the piece&#x27;s resilient defense of an alternative family structure, will win over all but the most doctrinaire political standard-bearers.&quot;

James Berardinelli wrote in &quot;ReelViews&quot;, &quot;The film is so boisterously entertaining that it&#x27;s easy for the unsuspecting viewer not to realize that there&#x27;s a message here.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, especially praising Williams&#x27;s performance: &quot;...this is one of his most cohesive and least antic performances. It&#x27;s also a mischievously funny one: He does a fine job of integrating gag lines with semi-serious acting...&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Lance Loud commented, &quot;Taking on the conservative agenda—more prevalent in our culture today than when the original film came out in 1979—&quot;The Birdcage&quot; goes beyond mere politics.&quot; He concluded that the film&#x27;s &quot;underlying feelings of compassion, tolerance, and understanding are this &quot;Bird&quot;″s brightest plumage&quot;.

Criticisms from the gay community opined that the film contained broad stereotypes of gay people, particularly in its depiction of effeminate gay men. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bruce Bawer wrote that the film reinforces stereotypes that &quot;homosexuals are marginal, superficial creatures with plenty of disposable income and relationships that aren&#x27;t as solid as heterosexual marriages&quot;. In response to the criticisms, Nichols stressed that the film is not meant to reflect the gay community as a whole, commenting, &quot;Our jokes were about divas, about the theater, and about the stars. And some critics responded as if they were about gay people in general. That just isn&#x27;t so.&quot;

The Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) praised the film for &quot;going beyond the stereotypes to see the characters&#x27; depth and humanity. The film celebrates differences and points out the outrageousness of hiding those differences.&quot; The film was also nominated for a GLAAD Media Award.

== Legacy ==
&quot;The Birdcage&quot; represented a major turning point for media portrayal of LGBTQ people. &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; and &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; also featured drag queens and were released prior to &quot;The Birdcage&quot;, but did not achieve the same level of box-office success, and studio films centering on gay people to that point, such as &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, tended to focus on tragic stories concerning HIV/AIDS. Academic Matthew Jones said that the arrival of &quot;The Birdcage&quot;, a comedy that celebrated being gay, &quot;helped an audience traumatised by a decade of living day-to-day with the threat of disease and death to laugh again&quot;. In 2021, Emily Maskell of the BBC wrote, &quot;What is particularly astute about the film&#x27;s comedy is the way in which it mixes its farcical hijinks with a satirical intent, taking aim at both homophobia and the crisis of masculinity, as it navigates the infiltration of conservatism into a liberal space.&quot;

Many critics have said that the film&#x27;s resonance is due to its core theme of family, its depiction of a loving, long-term relationship between two men, and the parents ultimately coming together to make their children happy. Nathan Lane commented, &quot;Homophobia is still alive and well but there&#x27;s something about that film that touches people because it&#x27;s ultimately about family, what you do for your family, why you love your family even though they drive you crazy. Then ultimately — not to sound corny — it&#x27;s about love. It&#x27;s about love in both families and coming to accept one another in their differences.&quot;

For the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2021, TCM and Fathom Events screened &quot;The Birdcage&quot; theatrically as part of their Big Screen Classics series.

<doc id="239591" wikidata="Q849638" url="?curid=239591" title="Novus ordo seclorum">
<text>The phrase Novus ordo seclorum (, ; &quot;New order of the ages&quot;) is one of two Latin mottos on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States. The other motto is &quot;Annuit cœptis&quot;. The mottos were coined by Charles Thomson, the secretary of the Congress of the Confederation. 

Thomson derived the phrase &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; from a poem by the Roman poet Virgil. He wrote that the phrase signified &quot;the beginning of the New American Era&quot; as of the date of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, which was depicted in Roman numerals at the base of the pyramid on the seal.

== Origin ==
The phrase derives from the fourth poem of the &quot;Eclogues&quot; by the Latin poet Virgil. The fourth eclogue contains the passage (lines 4–10):

The motto is specifically a rephrasing of the second line: &quot;Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo&quot; (The great cycle of ages is born anew).

== Meaning ==
The forms &quot;saecla&quot;, &quot;saeclorum&quot; etc. were normal alternatives to the more common &quot;saecula&quot; etc. throughout the history of Latin poetry and prose. The form &quot;saeculorum&quot; is impossible in hexameter verse: the &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;o&quot; are long, the &quot;u&quot; short by position.

The word &quot;seclorum&quot; does not mean &quot;secular&quot;, but is the genitive (possessive) plural form of the word &quot;saeculum&quot;, meaning (in this context) generation, century, or age. &quot;Saeculum&quot; did come to mean &quot;age, world&quot; in late, Christian Latin, and &quot;secular&quot; is derived from it, through &quot;secularis&quot;. However, the adjective &quot;secularis,&quot; meaning &quot;worldly,&quot; is not equivalent to the genitive plural &quot;seclorum,&quot; meaning &quot;of the ages.&quot;

The motto &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; was translated and added to the seal by Charles Thomson, a Latin expert who was involved in the design of the Great Seal, as &quot;A new order of the ages.&quot; Thomson said it was to signify &quot;the beginning of the new American Era&quot; as of the date of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, which was depicted in Roman numerals at the base of the pyramid on the seal.

<text>Paul Brandon Gilbert (born November 6, 1966) is an American hard rock and heavy metal guitarist. He is the co-founder of the band Mr. Big, and was also a member of Racer X, with whom he released several albums. In 1996, Gilbert launched a solo career, for which he has released numerous solo albums, and featured in numerous collaborations and guest appearances on other musicians&#x27; albums.

Gilbert was voted fourth-best on &quot;Guitar One&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time&quot;. He was also ranked in &quot;Guitar World&#x27;s&quot; 2008 list, &quot;50 Fastest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Gilbert was ranked number one in &quot;Loudwire&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;10 Stupidly Fast Guitarists in Metal&quot;.
== Shrapnel Records ==
Gilbert was raised mostly in the Pittsburgh suburb of Greensburg, Pennsylvania. He began playing music at age six; by age 15, he was playing local clubs with his band (Tau Zero), and had been featured in Guitar Player magazine (alongside fellow up-and-comer Yngwie Malmsteen). In 1982, Gilbert attended a guitar seminar hosted by Randy Rhoads, whom he also saw perform live twice. Around 1981, Gilbert first contacted Mike Varney (founder of Shrapnel Records), asking for a gig with metal mega-star Ozzy Osbourne. At the time, Varney did not think Osbourne would want a 15-year-old guitarist; but, after listening to Gilbert&#x27;s demo tape, he changed his mind. They continued talking over the next 3 years, culminating in Gilbert&#x27;s 1984 cross-country move to Los Angeles to attend the GIT (Guitar Institute of Technology). Even at the young age of 17, Gilbert quickly became a local legend due to his advanced and extremely fast alternate picking technique, his young age, and his massive repertoire of cover material. He was hired as a GIT instructor in 1985, and recorded Racer X&#x27;s debut album &quot;Street Lethal&quot; soon after.

== Racer X ==

Formed in Los Angeles in 1985, Racer X was originally composed of Paul Gilbert (lead guitar), Juan Alderete (bass guitar), Harry Gschoesser (drums), and Jeff Martin (vocals). They were heavily influenced by Judas Priest, and Gilbert&#x27;s playing was reminiscent of Yngwie Malmsteen, displaying fast-driven solos with advanced technique. Gschoesser was replaced by Scott Travis (later Judas Priest&#x27;s drummer) in 1986, and Bruce Bouillet, one of Gilbert&#x27;s private students at GIT, was added as a second guitarist after demonstrating an ability to harmonize Gilbert&#x27;s string skipping sequences. Gilbert gained recognition as one of the world&#x27;s fastest guitarists due to incredibly technical pieces like &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot;, &quot;Frenzy&quot;, &quot;Scarified&quot;, &quot;Y.R.O.&quot; and &quot;Scit Scat Wah&quot;. Around this time, Gilbert also recorded his first instructional video, &quot;Intense Rock&quot;, in which he demonstrated a number of his famous techniques and practice regimens in detail. Throughout his career he released many more instructional videos.

Racer X toured the American southwest, primarily the state of California, selling out thousand-seat venues. Despite their rigorous fan base, they had no prospects for a major label deal and Gilbert became increasingly disinterested. In 1987, he was approached by Talas bassist Billy Sheehan, one of his biggest influences, about forming a band; it became Mr. Big.

Gilbert left Racer X in 1988, but reformed it after the 1996 breakup of Mr. Big. Paul contacted the members of Racer X, and all agreed to return with the exception of Bruce Bouillet, who could barely play guitar at the time due to a severe bout of carpal tunnel syndrome. In mid-1999, the band recorded the album &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot;, which went gold in Japan. Racer X&#x27;s new record label requested a follow-up; so, in late 2000, they released &quot;Superheroes&quot;, mixed by Bouillet.

To further capitalize on their new-found success in Japan, Universal Japan requested that the band perform for a live-album CD and DVD. On May 25, 2001, the band played their first live performance in thirteen years, to a sold-out crowd, at the world-famous Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. The resulting CD and DVD were released in 2002 under the title &quot;Snowball of Doom&quot;.

In January 2002, in support of &quot;Superheroes&quot; and &quot;Snowball of Doom&quot;, Racer X toured Japan and Taiwan. The band performed these shows in their Superheroes costumes. The tour&#x27;s final show, in Yokohama, was hastily recorded in two tracks on the sound board and later released as &quot;Snowball of Doom 2&quot;. Later that year, Universal Japan pushed for another Racer X release. In October 2002, all four members of Racer X gathered at Gilbert&#x27;s house in Las Vegas to record &quot;Getting Heavier&quot;, which was sold alongside &quot;Snowball of Doom 2&quot; in a package deal. Although the album was a successful release in Japan, some fans were disappointed with the lighter tracks, which resembled a Paul Gilbert solo album more than a conventional Racer X album.

Racer X performed at the 2009 NAMM Show at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California. Andy Timmons and his band opened the show, followed by a solo set from Paul Gilbert, and finally Racer X. The Racer X lineup consisted of Paul Gilbert, Scott Travis, Jeff Martin and John Alderete.

== Mr. Big ==
When bass guitarist Billy Sheehan left David Lee Roth&#x27;s solo band in 1988, he and Gilbert co-founded Mr. Big, which included Pat Torpey on drums and Eric Martin on vocals. The band was initially successful in Japan, but achieved international stardom with the 1991 release of their second studio album &quot;Lean into It&quot;. This album featured the acoustic ballad &quot;To Be with You&quot;, which received strong play on radio stations and MTV, rising to #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Mr. Big broke up in 1996, at which point Gilbert launched his solo career. When Mr. Big reformed soon after, Gilbert, who was already committed to his own record contract, was replaced by Richie Kotzen. Mr. Big disbanded again in 2002, but Gilbert reunited the original members in June 2009 for a worldwide reunion tour. The band recorded a new album with producer Kevin Shirley titled &quot;What If...&quot;. The album was released in Japan on December 15, 2010, in Europe on January 21, 2011, and in the U.S. in Feb. 2011. A tour to support the album kicked off at the Hollywood location of The House of Blues on April 2, 2011, followed by several dates in Japan. In May and June 2011, the tour continued in Taiwan, China, Korea, the Philippines, and Europe.

In September 2014, Mr. Big released &quot;...The Stories We Could Tell&quot;, produced by Pat Regan. During the recording of the album, it was revealed that drummer Pat Torpey had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. For the tour that followed, Mr. Big enlisted the help of drummer Matt Starr of Burning Rain, to take over Torpey&#x27;s drumming duties, whilst Torpey acted as &quot;drum producer&quot;. Torpey did accompany the band on the subsequent tour, playing hand percussion, providing backup vocals and drumming on a few tracks per show.

The band released their ninth studio effort, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, on July 7, 2017. It is the last album to feature Torpey&#x27;s drumming and first with Matt Starr&#x27;s. On February 7, 2018, Torpey died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 64. His last show took place at the Wulfrun Hall in Wolverhampton on November 23, 2017. A memorial show took place on May 23, 2018, at The Canyon in Agoura Hills, California, with former member Richie Kotzen as a special guest. The all-star finale of &quot;To Be With You&quot; included, among others, Matt Sorum, Dave Amato, Ricky Phillips, Keith St John, Prescott Niles, Kelly Keagy, Jeff Scott Soto, Ace Von Johnson and Gregg Bissonette.

In October 2018, singer Eric Martin said in an interview with Friday NI Rocks that the band is in the process of planning their next album. According to the frontman, once the band is done with its 2019 touring commitments, they will subsequently disband: &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s the last hurrah – that&#x27;s it. It feels a little uncomfortable to keep going without Pat Torpey.&quot;

== Other projects ==

In May 2003 Gilbert performed twice with the project Yellow Matter Custard, a Beatles cover band consisting also of Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), Neal Morse (ex-Spock&#x27;s Beard), and Matt Bissonette. In February 2011, Yellow Matter Custard reformed for three shows across America. Kasim Sulton replaced Matt Bissonette for these shows due to other commitments. The band took their name from a Beatles lyric in the song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;: &quot;Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog&#x27;s eye&quot;.

Gilbert rejoined Portnoy along with Dave LaRue and Daniel Gildenlöw for a Led Zeppelin tribute band called Hammer of the Gods in November 2003. The same year, Gilbert toured Japan with Linus of Hollywood, TJ Helmerich, and Scot Coogan in support of his solo albums &quot;Burning Organ&quot;, &quot;Paul the Young Dude/The Best of Paul Gilbert&quot;, and &quot;Gilbert Hotel&quot;. In September 2005, he joined Portnoy, Sean Malone, and Jason McMaster in the Rush tribute band Cygnus and the Sea Monsters. In May 2006, he joined Portnoy, Gary Cherone, and Billy Sheehan to form &quot;Amazing Journey: A Tribute to The Who&quot;, playing three shows. The band (excluding Sheehan) destroyed their equipment after the show in homage.

Gilbert was revealed to be the guest guitarist on the 2007 Neal Morse solo album &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot;. That same year, Gilbert toured with Bruce Bouillet to promote Gilbert&#x27;s first instrumental album &quot;Get Out of My Yard&quot;. Joining him on tour was Gilbert&#x27;s wife Emi on keyboards. Gilbert also joined Joe Satriani and John Petrucci on the 2007 G3 tour. This was the fifth North American G3 run and the 12th tour worldwide since its inception. On January 23, 2008, Gilbert released an instrumental album titled &quot;Silence Followed by a Deafening Roar&quot;. The album was released in Europe on March 31, 2008, and in America on April 8, 2008. This was Gilbert&#x27;s second instrumental album.

On October 22, 2008, Gilbert released an album with vocalist Freddie Nelson entitled &quot;United States&quot;. The collaboration has been described as a cross between Queen and Mr. Big. Gilbert performed with Racer X at the 2009 NAMM Show at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California. Andy Timmons and his band opened the show, followed by a solo set from Gilbert, and finally Racer X. This Racer X lineup consisted of Gilbert, Scott Travis, Jeff Martin and John Alderete. Gilbert also joined George Lynch and Richie Kotzen on the Guitar Generation tour.

On June 30, 2010, Gilbert&#x27;s new album &quot;Fuzz Universe&quot; was released in Japan, with a release in America and Europe soon after. It was Gilbert&#x27;s third instrumental solo album. A cover version of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Leave That Junk Alone&quot; was featured as a Japanese bonus track. On June 25, 2014, Gilbert released his studio album &quot;Stone Pushing Uphill Man&quot;. Initially only available in Japan, the album was eventually released in the United States on August 12, 2014. Gilbert is currently the Rock Guitar instructor for ArtistWorks, an online music school.

== Influences and style ==
When interviewed about his musical and stylistic influences, Paul Gilbert mentions many different artists, including: Randy Rhoads, Kim Mitchell, Eddie Van Halen, Yngwie Malmsteen, Tony Iommi, Alex Lifeson, Jimmy Page, Johnny Ramone, Robin Trower, Ritchie Blackmore, Pat Travers, Gary Moore, Michael Schenker, Judas Priest, Akira Takasaki, Steve Clark, Jimi Hendrix, Kiss, and The Ramones. On many occasions, Gilbert has stated that his uncle Jimi Kidd was vital in heavily fueling Gilbert&#x27;s childhood interest in playing guitar. Gilbert grew up a great fan of Rush, Todd Rundgren, Cheap Trick and The Beatles, artists who frequently influence his songwriting style. He stated on the &quot;Space Ship Live&quot; DVD that George Harrison is one of his favorite guitar players. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine declared him one of 50 of the world&#x27;s fastest guitarists of all time, along with Buckethead, Eddie Van Halen, and Yngwie Malmsteen.

Paul Gilbert composes music in a wide variety of styles, including pop, rock, metal, blues, and funk. He is best known for his shredding, stylistic versatility and efficient staccato picking technique. He combines fast picking and legato techniques in the same phrase, usually instinctively. When teaching/demonstrating a particular phrase, he has to think about what he is actually doing with his right hand in order to explain it. Despite being famous for his heavy metal work and his rapid right hand ability, Gilbert has since dissociated himself from that style of playing, instead gravitating towards blues and melodic ideas.

== Instructional career ==
Paul Gilbert wrote his own section of the British guitar magazine, &quot;Total Guitar&quot;, where he normally demonstrated guitar techniques in the magazine and accompanying CD. Even before that, he contributed instructional articles to &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine in a late 1980s/early 1990s series entitled &quot;Terrifying Guitar 101&quot;. His period of working with &quot;Total Guitar&quot; spanned 31 issues until the November 2006 issue. Gilbert also teaches at the Guitar Institute of Technology (GIT) regularly, and is also an &quot;honorary dean&quot; of the GIT division in Japan. Gilbert visits Japan, enjoying the lifestyle like his Shrapnel labelmate Marty Friedman, who still lives in Japan and speaks Japanese fluently. Gilbert is known for his instructional videos, which are often comical in nature. One of his instructional videos includes him pulling a rabbit out of his guitar, putting his guitar in a straitjacket and having presents thrown at him by members of the film crew. Gilbert also was, for a short time, the guitar teacher of Buckethead, Joey Tafolla, Russ Parrish (A.K.A. Satchel from Steel Panther), Michelle Meldrum (the late wife of Europe guitarist John Norum) and Nicole Couch of Phantom Blue. Gilbert now writes a column for &quot;Premier Guitar&quot; entitled &quot;Shred Your Enthusiasm&quot;. In May 2012 he launched the Online Rock Guitar School with Paul Gilbert as a part of the ArtistWorks Guitar Campus.

In August 2014, Gilbert participated in the G4 Experience—a week-long guitar camp—with fellow guitarists Joe Satriani, Andy Timmons, and multi-instrumentalist Mike Keneally.

== Equipment ==

Paul Gilbert primarily uses his Ibanez PGM signature series guitars, identified by the unique painted on &quot;F-holes&quot;. Although earlier PGM models featured the Ibanez Lo-Pro/Edge double locking tremolo system, many of his guitars (such as his main PGM300) were modified to accommodate a fixed bridge after he stopped using whammy bars in the early 90s, hence the Ibanez PGM301 guitar. Along with his signature guitars, Gilbert often uses his sticker-covered &quot;Dino&quot; Ibanez RG750, in addition to a wide variety of Ibanez solid-body and semi-hollow electric guitars. Recently, Gilbert has been using Ibanez &quot;Fireman&quot; (a reversed-body Ibanez Iceman with single-coil pickups and an extra cutaway) guitars, which he designed himself. A red version of The Ibanez Fireman is to be mass-produced for consumers at a more affordable price than the Ibanez PGMFRM1 (current Paul Gilbert signature Fireman) in Fall 2011. Gilbert now has a short (22.2 inch) scale signature guitar – the Ibanez PGMM31 based on the existing Ibanez Mikro range.

In 2014, Gilbert announced his new Ibanez signature model guitar, FRM250MF, at the NAMM Show in 2014.

Gilbert endorses Direct Sound extreme isolation headphones, using the EX-29 model. Suffering tinnitus after years of loud music in headphones and live, Paul has posted a list of recommendations on how to help prevent tinnitus and noise-induced loss.

In 2020, Gilbert collaborated with boutique pedal maker JHS Pedals and released the &quot;PG-14&quot; tube-like distortion pedal.

Gilbert is a long time user of Ernie Ball strings and has used a variety of different gauges on his electric guitars, and he has stated he has used as light as their .08-.38 strings (Extra Slinky) and has used as heavy as their .11-.48 strings (Power Slinky). For picks, Gilbert currently uses several variations of Dunlop Tortex .50mm, .60mm and .73mm picks, explaining that he switched to thin picks because he likes the tone and the pick scratches they offer.

== Personal life ==
Gilbert was married from 1993 to 1998 to Patricia Gilbert (née Patterson).

As of 2012, Gilbert has resided in Portland, Oregon, with his second wife, Emi Gilbert. They married in 2005 and have a son, born in 2014.

<text>The Raelettes (or occasionally The Raelets or The Raeletts) were an American girl group formed in 1958 to provide backing vocals for Ray Charles. They were reformed from the group The Cookies. Between 1966 and 1973, the Raelettes recorded on Tangerine Records as a separate act produced and accompanied by Charles.

== History ==
Reformed by Ray Charles from the all-girl singing group The Cookies, Charles first invited The Cookies for a recording session in New York City, in August 1956, where they taped &quot;Lonely Avenue&quot;, &quot;I Want To Know&quot; and &quot;Leave My Woman Alone&quot;. The Cookies&#x27; lineup at the time consisted of Margie Hendrix, Dorothy Jones, and Darlene McCrea.

The Raelettes were officially established in 1958. The first lineup consisted of Darlene McCrea, Margie Hendricks, Patricia Lyles, and Gwendolyn Berry. The Raelettes were an integral part of Charles&#x27; organization and provided backing vocals on various hits, such as &quot;Night Time Is the Right Time&quot; (1958), &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; (1959) and &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; (1961).

In the early years, Margie Hendrix was the Raelette&#x27;s foremost member. Ray Charles said about her: &quot;Aretha, Gladys, Etta James — these gals are all bad, but on any given night, Margie will scare you to death.&quot; Ray and Margie had many affairs, but she started using drugs and alcohol and after a final argument in 1964, she was fired from the Raelettes and later died in 1973.

The group always consisted of 4 or 5 singers. The ever-changing lineup included Minnie Riperton, Merry Clayton, Clydie King of the Blackberries, Edna Wright of Honey Cone, and latter-day Supreme Susaye Greene.

Charles also produced and played piano on solo singles for various Raelettes. He formed Tangerine Records in 1962, and the Raeletts released three top 40 R&amp;B hits between 1967 and 1971: &quot;One Hurt Deserves Another&quot; (1967), &quot;I&#x27;m Gettin&#x27; &#x27;Long All Right&quot; (1968), and &quot;Bad Water&quot; (1971). The compilation &quot;Souled Out&quot; was released in 1970, featuring songs R&amp;B duo Ike &amp; Tina Turner had recorded for Tangerine.

In the 1970s, Mable John sang lead vocals and the Raelttes toured independent of Charles. After she left the Raelettes returned to the background for good, with various lineups backing Charles until his death in 2004.

<doc id="239612" wikidata="Q386144" url="?curid=239612" title="Ōta Dōkan">
<text>, also known as Ōta Sukenaga (太田 資長), was a Japanese samurai lord, poet and Buddhist monk. He took the tonsure as a Buddhist priest in 1478, and he also adopted the Buddhist name, Dōkan, by which he is known today. Dōkan is best known as the architect and builder of Edo Castle (now the Imperial Palace) in what is today modern Tokyo; and he is considered the founder of the castle town which grew up around that Ōnin era fortress.

==Ōta clan genealogy==
The Ōta clan originated in 15th-century Musashi Province. They claimed descent from Minamoto no Yorimasa, and through that branch of the Minamoto they claimed kinship with the Seiwa-Genji.

The feudal progenitor of the clan name, Ōta Sukekuni, established himself at Ōta in Tanba Province, and he adopted this location name as his own. He traced his lineage as a fifth-generation descendant of Yorimasa.
In a special context created by the Tokugawa shogunate, the Ōta clan were identified as &quot;tozama&quot; or outsiders, in contrast with the &quot;fudai&quot; or insider &quot;daimyō&quot; clans which were hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawas.

In, 1638, Ōta Sukemune, the grandson of Ōta Yasusuke, was granted Nishio Domain in Mikawa Province; and then, in 1645, he and his family was transferred to Hamamatsu Domain (35,000 &quot;koku&quot;) in Tōtōmi Province. Yasusuke&#x27;s descendants were moved several times by shogunate decree, residing successively in 1687 at Tanaka Domain in Suruga Province, in 1703 at Tanakura Domain in Mutsu Province, and in 1728 at Tatebayashi Domain in Kōzuke Province. Then, in the period spanning the years 1746 through 1868, this branch of the Ōta clan established itself at Kakegawa Domain (53,000 &quot;koku&quot;) in Tōtōmi.

The head of this clan line was ennobled as a &quot;Viscount&quot; in the Meiji period.

==Events of Dōkan&#x27;s life==
Although born into the Ōta clan—and claimed by the Ōta as a clan celebrity—Dōkan served as a vassal of the Ōgigayatsu branch of the Uesugi clan which occupied land in the Kantō region of Honshū.

Dōkan is credited with designing and building Edo Castle for (1443–1494) over the fortifications Edo Shigenaga had earlier built. Work on the defensive walls and moats began in 1457; and he took the name Dōkan the following year.

Ōgigayatsu Uesugi Mochitomo ordered Ōta Michizane and Dōkan to construct fortifications at Kawagoe in 1457.

As a military strategist, he is reputed to have been an effective tactician; but political intrigues can be as deadly as any battle. Despite years of distinguished service, the Uesugi clan leader proved fickle. Dōkan met an untimely end at &#x27;s home in Sagami (modern-day Kanagawa) after he was falsely accused of disloyalty during a period when the Uesugi family struggled through an internal clan conflict. His death poem is as follows:
Following his death, the castle was then abandoned until it was taken over by Ieyasu in 1590.
Dōkan was also well-read in classical (Heian period) literature; and like other samurai of his time, Dōkan was said to have been a skilled poet, but only fragments attributed to him have survived.

Dōkan is also credited with having selected the site of the Hikawa Shrine, which is dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane, the &quot;kami&quot; of poetry and scholarship. Hikawa Shrine is located very near Edo Castle.

==Legacy==
Dōkan&#x27;s residence in Kamakura became Eishō-ji, a Buddhist temple. The temple complex was founded by Okaji, a daughter of Ōta Yasusuke who would have been one of Dōkan&#x27;s great-great-grandsons. Okaji was one of Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s attendants, and she later became a foster mother to Tokugawa Yorifusa (1603–61), the founder of the Mito branch of the Tokugawa family. After Ieyasu&#x27;s death, Okatsu became a nun, taking the name Eishoin. The third shōgun, Tokugawa Iemitsu (1604–51), granted her the property her ancestors had once owned. In 1636, Eishoin had a temple built and she invited a daughter of Yorifusa to join her. Eisho-ji&#x27;s prosperity helped preserve the memory of the 15th century ancestor who once lived in the same place.

In the late 16th century, Dōkan&#x27;s Edo Castle was chosen as the new home of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who had been persuaded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi to transfer the seat of his clan holdings into the Kantō. With the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in the early 17th century, Edo Castle became the center of the shogunate government. When the shogunate was displaced in the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century, the newly named Tokyo became an Imperial capital with an Imperial Palace rising from the former shōgun&#x27;s stronghold. Every October 1, modern Tokyo celebrates the anniversary of its founding, which becomes a festival in honor of the memory of the samurai who would become honored as the founder of a great city.

The city of Isehara celebrates Dōkan&#x27;s contributions to the area with the annual Dōkan festival each summer.

Dōkan&#x27;s 15th century poetic description of what was once just a fortified hill on the Sumida River near Edo Bay would become the basis for metropolitan Tokyo Governor Ryokichi Minobe&#x27;s 1971 re-election slogan: &quot;Give Tokyo back its blue sky!&quot;

Instead of stone walls, the defense works around the 15th-century castle were only grassy embankments, and the structures inside them were not grand. The initial enclosure which served as the castle&#x27;s core area, the space which would have been Dōkan&#x27;s &quot;hon-maru,&quot; was modestly sized; but the moats were extensive for that time period. These moats and their locations would figure prominently in the serial phases of construction and development which followed.

Dōkan is also credited with diverting the Hira River east at Kandabashi to create the Nihonbashi River.

Celebrations attending the 500th Anniversary of Greater Tokyo illuminated parts of the story of Dōkan&#x27;s life and achievements; and since that time, he has remained a well-known figure in modern popular culture.

<text>Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester (3 September 1724 – 10 November 1808), known between 1776 and 1786 as Sir Guy Carleton, was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. He twice served as Governor of the Province of Quebec, from 1768 to 1778, concurrently serving as Governor General of British North America in that time, and again from 1785 to 1795. The title Baron Dorchester was created on 21 August 1786.

He commanded British troops in the American Revolutionary War, first leading the defence of Quebec during the 1775 rebel invasion, and the 1776 counteroffensive that drove the rebels from the province. In 1782 and 1783, he led as the commander-in-chief of all British forces in North America. In this capacity he was notable for carrying out the Crown&#x27;s promise of freedom to slaves who joined the British, and he oversaw the evacuation of British forces, Loyalists, and more than 3,000 freedmen from New York City in 1783 to transport them to a British colony. Toward this end, Carleton assigned Samuel Birch to create the &quot;Book of Negroes&quot;.

The military and political career of his younger brother, Thomas Carleton, was interwoven with his own, and Thomas served under him in the Canadas.

==Early career==
Guy Carleton was born into an Ulster Protestant military family that had lived in Ulster in the north of the Kingdom of Ireland since the Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century, and was one of three brothers (the others being Thomas Carleton and William Carleton) who served in the British military. He was born and raised in Strabane in the west of County Tyrone, just across the River Foyle from Lifford in County Donegal. Guy also had a sister, Connolly Crawford. When he was fourteen his father, Christopher Carleton, died, and his mother, Catherine Carleton, then married Reverend Alexander Skelton, who took responsibility for his education.

In 1742, at the age of seventeen, Carleton was commissioned as an ensign into the 25th Regiment of Foot, in which in 1745 he was promoted to lieutenant. During this period he became a friend of James Wolfe; he may have served with Wolfe at the Battle of Culloden during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Two of his brothers, William and Thomas, also joined the British Army.

In 1740 the War of the Austrian Succession broke out in Europe. Despite British troops having been engaged on the European continent since 1742, it was not until 1747 that Carleton and his regiment were despatched to Flanders. They fought the French, but were unable to prevent the Fall of Bergen-op-Zoom, a major Dutch fortress, and the war was brought to a halt by an armistice. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed and Carleton returned to Britain. He was frustrated to still only be a lieutenant, and believed his opportunities of advancement would be limited with the end of the war.

In 1751 he joined the 1st Foot Guards and in 1752 was promoted to captain. His career received a major boost when he was chosen, at the suggestion of Wolfe, to act as a guide to The 3rd Duke of Richmond during a tour of the battlefields of the recent war. Richmond would become an influential patron to Carleton.
==Seven Years&#x27; War==
===Germany===

In 1757, Guy Carleton was made a lieutenant colonel and served as part of the Army of Observation made up of German troops designed to protect Hanover from French invasion. The army was forced to retreat following the Battle of Hastenbeck and eventually concluded the Convention of Klosterzeven, taking them out of the war. After the convention was signed, Carleton returned to Britain. In 1758 he was made the lieutenant colonel of the newly formed 72nd Regiment of Foot. James Wolfe selected Carleton as his aide in the 1758 attack on Louisbourg. King George II declined to make this appointment, possibly because of negative comments he made about the soldiers of Hanover during his service on the Continent.

For some time he was unable to gain active position, until he was sent back to Germany to serve as an aide-de-camp to Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick.

===Canada===
In December 1758 Wolfe, now a major general, was given command of the upcoming campaign against the city of Quebec, and selected Carleton as his quarter-master general. King George refused to make this appointment also until Lord Ligonier talked to the king about the matter and the king changed his mind. When Lieutenant-Colonel Carleton arrived in Halifax he assumed command of six hundred grenadiers. He was with the British forces when they arrived at Quebec in June 1759. Carleton was responsible for the provisioning of the army and also acting as an engineer supervising the placement of cannon. Carleton received a head wound during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham and he returned to England after the battle in October 1759.

===France and Havana===

On 29 March 1761, as the lieutenant colonel of the 72nd Regiment of Foot he took part in the attack on Belle Île, an island off the coast of the northern part of the Bay of Biscay, off the coast of France. Carleton led an attack on the French, but was seriously wounded and prevented from taking any further part in the fighting. After four weeks of fighting, the British gained complete control of the island.

He was made colonel in 1762 and took part in the British expedition against Cuba, which also included Richard Montgomery, who went on to oppose him in 1775. On 22 July, he was wounded leading an attack on a Spanish outpost.

In 1764 he transferred to the 93rd Regiment of Foot.

==Governor of Quebec==
On 7 April 1766, Carleton was named acting Lieutenant Governor and Administrator of Quebec with James Murray officially in charge. He arrived in Quebec on 22 September 1766. As Carleton had no experience in public affairs and came from a politically insignificant family, his appointment is unusual and was possibly a surprise to him. One connection may have been due to the Duke of Richmond, who in 1766 been made Secretary of State for the North American colonies. Fourteen years earlier, Carleton had tutored the Duke. The Duke was the colonel of the 72nd Regiment of Foot, while Carleton was its lieutenant colonel. He appointed Carleton as commander-in-chief of all troops stationed in Quebec.

The government consisted of a Governor, a council, and an assembly. The governor could veto any action of the council, but London had also given Carleton instructions that all of his actions required the approval of the council. Most officials of the province at this time did not receive a salary and received their income through fees they charged for their services. Carleton tried to replace this system with one in which the officials received a regular salary, but this position was never supported in London. When Carleton renounced his own fees, Murray was furious.

After Murray resigned his position, Carleton was appointed Captain General and Governor-in-Chief on 12 April 1768. Carleton took the oath of office on 1 November 1768. On 9 August 1770 he sailed for England for what he thought was a few months&#x27; consultation on issues related to the integration of Quebec into the British system. During his absence, Hector Theophilus de Cramahé, the lieutenant governor, ran the provincial government, with the aid of the first chief justice, William Hey, and the Attorney-General, Francis Maseres. The British merchants of Quebec, many of whom had become disaffected to the colonial administration under Murray, were, at least initially, of good will. The merchants would later be agent for e.g. the Quebec Act 1774 (14 Geo. 3. c. 83) and finally the partition of the two Canadas in the Constitutional Act 1791 (31 Geo. 3. c. 31).

==Marriage and family==
On 22 May 1772, at the age of nearly 48, Carleton married Lady Maria Howard (1753–1836), daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of Effingham. They had nine sons and two daughters. His elder brothers having predeceased him, and himself dying two years before his father, third son Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Carleton was father of Arthur, 2nd Baron Dorchester; Christopher&#x27;s younger brother, the sixth son, Lieutenant-Colonel George Carleton, was father of Guy, the 3rd Baron.

The title was extinct at the 3rd Baron&#x27;s death in 1897, but it was revived when his daughter, Henrietta, was created Baroness Dorchester; the title was extinct again at the death of her son, Dudley, 2nd Baron, in 1963.

==Later career==

Carleton was promoted to major general on 25 May 1772. While he was in London, Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, based upon his recommendations. It determined how the province was to be administered and was part of a continuing effort to respect some French traditions while ensuring rights of citizens as understood by the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Carleton and Maria returned to Quebec on 18 September 1774, where he began implementing the provisions of the act. While the clergy and the &quot;seigneurs&quot; (petty gentry) were happy with provisions favorable to them, British merchants and migrants from the Thirteen Colonies objected to a number of the provisions, which they thought were pro-Catholic. They argued that only English-speaking Protestants should be able to vote or hold public office. Many of the &quot;habitants&quot; were unhappy with the provisions reinstating the tithe in support of the Catholic Church, as well as seigneurial obligations, such as the &quot;corvée&quot; (a labor requirement).

In late 1774, the First Continental Congress sent letters to Montreal denouncing the Quebec Act for promoting Catholicism by allowing Catholics to hold civil service positions and reinstating the tithe. John Brown, an agent for the Boston Committee of Correspondence, arrived in Montreal in early 1775 as part of an effort to persuade citizens to send delegates to the Second Continental Congress, scheduled to meet in May 1775. Carleton, while aware of this activity, did nothing to prevent it, beyond discouraging publication of the Congressional letter in the province&#x27;s only newspaper.

==American War of Independence==

===Defence of Canada===
Carleton received notice of the start of the rebellion in May 1775, soon followed by the news of the rebel capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point, and the raid on Fort Saint-Jean. As he had previously sent two of his regiments to Boston, he had only about 800 regular soldiers left in Quebec. His attempts to raise a militia met with limited success at first, as neither the ethnic French nor the English residents were willing to join. Area Natives were willing to fight on the British side, and the Crown wanted them to do so, but Carleton turned their offer down because he feared the Natives attacking non-combatants. For the same reason, he limited Guy Johnson and his Iroquois allies, who had come to Quebec from New York, to operating only in Quebec.

During the summer of 1775, Carleton directed the preparation of provincial defences, which were focused on Fort Saint-Jean. In September, the Continental Army began its invasion and besieged the fort. When it fell in November, Carleton was forced to flee from Montreal to Quebec City, escaping capture by disguising himself as a commoner.

In December 1775 he directed the city&#x27;s defences in the Battle of Quebec and the ensuing siege, which was broken by the arrival of British troops in May 1776 under command of John Burgoyne, who was appointed second-in-command. Carleton&#x27;s younger brother Thomas was part of the relief effort.

Guy Carleton launched a counteroffensive against the rebels, which included repelling an attempted attack on Trois-Rivières. In June 1776, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Bath. He was promoted to the rank of a general for America only on 26 March 1776.

The next month Carleton commanded British naval forces on the Richelieu River, culminating in the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in October 1776 against a rebel fleet led by General Benedict Arnold. The British, with a significantly superior fleet, won a decisive victory, destroying or capturing most of the rebel fleet, but the delay prevented Carleton from continuing on to capture Fort Ticonderoga that year. His brother Thomas and nephew Christopher both served on his staff during the campaign. The morning following the battle, a small island in Lake Champlain was named Carleton&#x27;s Prize, perhaps to Carleton&#x27;s embarrassment at the time.

He was promoted to lieutenant general on 6 September 1777. In 1777, command of the major northern expedition to divide the rebel colonies was given to General Burgoyne. Upset that he had not been given its command, Carleton asked to be recalled. He was replaced as governor and military commander of Quebec in 1778 by Frederick Haldimand, and returned to England. In 1780 he was appointed by Prime Minister Lord North to a commission investigating public finances. This post he held until 1782, when General Sir Henry Clinton was recalled in the aftermath of the 1781 surrender at Yorktown. Carleton was appointed to replace Clinton as Commander-in-Chief, America, in May 1782. His headquarters in New York City were located at Number One Broadway.

===Evacuation of New York===

In August 1783, Carleton was informed that Great Britain would grant the United States its independence. With his exit from New York imminent, Carleton asked to be relieved of his command. With this news, Loyalists began an exodus from the Thirteen Colonies and Carleton did his best to have them resettled outside the United States.

In May he had met with George Washington, among others, to arrange for the implementation of those parts of the Treaty of Paris relating to the evacuation of New York City, then commanded by Carleton and still occupied by the British Army, many Loyalists and former slaves. Carleton had refused to deliver over the human property to the Americans at the time of the British evacuation. Instead, he proposed a registry so that &quot;the owners might eventually be paid for the slaves who were entitled to their freedom by British Proclamation and promises.&quot;

Sir Guy noted that nothing could be changed in any Articles that were inconsistent with prior policies or National Honour. He added that the only mode was to pay for the Negroes, in which case justice was done to all, the former slaves and the owners. Carleton said that it would be a breach of faith not to honour the British policy of liberty to the Negro and declared that if removing them proved to be an infraction of the treaty, then compensation would have to be paid by the British government. To provide for such a contingency, he had a register kept of all Negroes who left, called the &quot;Book of Negroes&quot;, entering their names, ages, occupations, and names of their former masters. The Americans agreed to this but the Crown never paid compensation. The Loyalist Claims Commission, using the logic of the Somerset Case and the Philipsburg Proclamation, determined that people could not be claimed as property, and only property could be a matter of compensation. The British transported about 3,000 freedmen and other Black Loyalists to Nova Scotia, The Bahamas, and as far away as Germany for resettlement in the evacuation of New York City in November 1783 alone. Thousands more, under the same agreement, were evacuated from Charleston, Savannah, and St. Augustine. All told, historians estimate that between 50,000 and 80,000 enslaved people were freed as the result of Carleton&#x27;s final enforcement of British proclamations, leading to, as historian Cassandra Pybus has described it, the &quot;single greatest act of abolition in early American history.&quot;

Washington, who worked to re-enslave free Black Loyalists (which included former slaves at Mount Vernon), strenuously disagreed with Sir Guy&#x27;s actions and wrote: &quot;…the measure is totally different from the letter and spirit of the Treaty but waiving the specialty of the point, leaving this decision to our respective Sovereigns I find it my duty to signify my readiness in conjunction with you to enter into agreements, or take any measures which may be deemed expedient to prevent the future carrying away any Negroes or other property of the American people.&quot;

On 28 November the evacuation was finished, and on 5 December Carleton departed from Staten Island to return to England. John Campbell of Strachur succeeded him as Commander-in-Chief, North America, although the post was then much reduced in scope.

== Post-war years and death ==
Upon his return to England, Carleton recommended the creation of a position of Governor General of all the provinces in British North America. Instead he was appointed &quot;Governor-in-chief&quot;, with simultaneous appointments as governor of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and St. John&#x27;s Island (present-day Prince Edward Island). He arrived in Quebec on 23 October 1786. His position as Governor-in-chief was mostly ignored. He found quickly that his authority in any of the provinces other than Quebec was effective only while he was present in person.

He was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in August 1786 as Baron Dorchester, of Dorchester in the County of Oxford. (His title therefore referred to the village of Dorchester on Thames, rather than to the better-known county town of Dorset.)

The Constitutional Act of 1791 split the large territory of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada, corresponding roughly to areas settled by ethnic British and ethnic French, respectively. Sir Alured Clarke was named as the lieutenant governor of Lower Canada and John Graves Simcoe the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. In August 1791 Carleton left for Britain and on 7 February 1792 took his seat in the House of Lords. He left for Canada again on 18 August 1793 to resume his duties there. His replacement, Robert Prescott, arrived in May 1796. On 9 July 1796 Carleton sailed from Canada to Britain, never to return.

In retirement Lord Dorchester, as he was now, lived mostly at Greywell Hill, adjoining Nately Scures, in Hampshire. After about 1805 he moved to Stubbings House at Burchett&#x27;s Green, near Maidenhead, in Berkshire. On 10 November 1808, he died suddenly at Stubbings. He was buried in the parish church of St Swithun&#x27;s, Nately Scures.

<doc id="239618" wikidata="Q1982669" url="?curid=239618" title="Burwell, Cambridgeshire">
<text>Burwell is a village and civil parish in Cambridgeshire, England, some 10 miles (16 km) north-east of Cambridge. It lies on the south-east edge of the Fens. Westward drainage is improved by Cambridgeshire lodes (waterways), including Burwell Lode, a growth factor in the village. A population of 6,309 in the 2011 census was put at 6,417 in 2019. 

==History==
===Etymology===
The name &quot;Burwell&quot;, Anglo-Saxon in origin, refers to a fort &quot;(burh-)&quot; close to a spring &quot;(-well)&quot;. The first record of the name dates from 1060. It appears in the 1086 Domesday Book as Burewelle, Burwella and Burwelle. There is a spring in the south of the village, close to remains of the 12th-century Burwell Castle, and evidence of previous settlement on or near the castle site.

Old maps sometimes name the village in the plural, &quot;Burwells&quot;. which may refer to a pair of parishes: Burwell St Mary and Burwell St Andrew, or to a distinction between the High Town round the churches in the south of the village and the newer North Street and Newnham parts, separated by a causeway.

===Early settlement===
There is evidence of prehistoric human activity in the vicinity of Burwell. Flint tools such as axes dating from the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic have been found on the west side of the village. Other burned and worked flint has been found close to the spring, dating from the late Neolithic, but most of the activity in the area at the time seemed to have been on the fen to the west of the village, where a large number of flint and stone tools discovered on a raised piece of ground suggest there was already settlement before the onset of the https://uploadpie.com/NASxMyBronze Age. During the Neolithic, peat began to form on the fenland round the village, which partly buried the prehistoric sites.

Activity on the fen continued into the Bronze Age, as did activity close to the spring but they were joined by increasing activity on the heath in the south of the parish, where barrows are known to have existed. The southern part of the parish is also the highest ground within it, and is close to the ancient Icknield Way.

As Burwell entered the Iron Age, activity on the fens to the west appears to have decreased as the conditions became more marshy. However, ditch systems and enclosures were found there during excavations in 1969 and 1995. Activity near the spring continued, with evidence of a burial in a nearby ditch. Settlement was revealed in 2005 on the eastern edge of the village.

Settlement close to the spring continued after Roman colonisation of Britain. Evidence has been found north of St Mary&#x27;s Church. Roman archaeological remains have been found round the village, including pottery, vessels and bowls, a lead vat, and coins perhaps relating to a villa in Ness Road, north of the village. Evidence of another villa in the same area comes in roof tiles from the 2nd century CE, although findings here and there cover the 2nd to 4th centuries. Reach Lode on the north-west edge was probably of Roman construction, as was the original Burwell Lode, since been replaced.

===Waterway===
The village is located at the head of Burwell Lode, a human-made waterway that connects it with the River Cam. The present course, laid out in the mid-17th century, replaced an older route that was probably Roman in origin. The lode splits in two at the village, each branch serving a series of basins, warehouses and wharves located at the bottom of long strips of land, with merchants&#x27; houses at the far end of them.

The village and lode gained importance with the opening in the 1850s of the Burwell Chemical Works owned by T. T. Ball. By the 1890s, this had become the Patent Manure Works owned by Colchester and Ball. About 10,000 tons of goods a year were shipped along it, using three steam tugs and a fleet of lighters. Prentice Brothers Ltd built barges in the village until 1920, and continued repairing them there after they bought the fertiliser factory in 1921. The factory was later owned by Fisons. Boats continued to be used to move the fertiliser to Fenland farms until 1948. Commercial use of the lode ceased in 1963, when the traffic in sugar beet stopped.

===Burwell Castle===
The village is the site of an unfinished castle in Spring Close, whose final wall was knocked down by the Fire Brigade testing a fire hose in the 1930s, but the dry moat is still visible. It was built during &quot;The Anarchy&quot;, the mid-12th-century conflict in the reign of King Stephen. Despite a settlement that the throne would pass to Henry II on Stephen&#x27;s death, the Barons took the opportunity to fight their own battles. Of these, Geoffrey de Mandeville was notably troublesome. After turning against Stephen, he set up an impregnable base around Ely, from which he attacked towns such as Cambridge. So the king ordered castles be built to surround him. The few known potential sites of these included Rampton (Giant&#x27;s Hill), Ramsey (Booth&#x27;s Hill), Burwell, and possibly Knapwell.

At Burwell, a moat was constructed and the stone keep partially built when Geoffrey attacked and was mortally wounded. His revolt then collapsed and the castle was left unfinished. The narrow lane along the side of the church next to Spring Close, where the Castle stood, is named Mandeville.

===Barn Fire===
On 8 September 1727, a travelling puppet show was filled with onlookers in a Burwell barn in what is now Cuckolds Row, near the centre of the village. The doors were nailed shut to stop further people getting in, an act that led to tragedy. Richard Whittaker, a hostler employed by the owner of the barn came back to feed the horses. He seems to expect to be admitted free but was not. He made his way to the stable, clambered over a partition with a candle lantern and peered in to watch. The candle set fire to the hay within. It was reported that with no way to escape, 80 of the 140 people inside perished in the ensuing blaze. Whittaker was tried at Cambridge Assizes in 1728, but acquitted. 

The &quot;Newcastle Courant&quot; reported on the fire
The victims were buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s, at the opposite end of the High Street, beneath a stone engraved with a blazing heart and angels&#x27; wings. An inscription on the reverse, added in 1910 when the stone was restored, states: &quot;To the memory of the 78 people who were burnt to death in a barn at Burwell on Sept 8th 1727.&quot; Inside the church is a separate memorial to two other victims, John and Ann Palmer. On 8 September 2005, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the site of the fire.

The &quot;Ipswich Journal&quot; of 26 February 1774 reported how &quot;an old man who died recently near Newmarket who just before his death confessed that he set fire to a barn at Burwell, Cambridgeshire on the 8th of September 1727 when no less than 80 persons lost their lives and that having an antipathy to the puppet showman was the cause of him committing the action.&quot; That man was Richard Whittaker.

==Governance==
Burwell is a parish and thus has a parish council to deal with matters within the village. These include the maintenance and provision of both village halls, the recreation ground, playgrounds, and allotments. The Parish Council convenes at the Jubilee Reading Room on The Causeway.

Burwell parish lies within Burwell ward and provides three councillors to East Cambridgeshire District Council, which convenes at The Grange, Ely. A larger Burwell electoral division provides one councillor to Cambridgeshire County Council, convening at Shire Hall in Cambridge.

The local government boundary has varied over the years. At parish level, the boundary followed Devil&#x27;s Dyke through the neighbouring village of Reach, bisecting it until it was turned into a new parish in 1961. The other boundaries of Burwell parish have also changed slightly over the years, most clearly on the south-eastern edge, where part of it including some of Newmarket Racecourse passed to Newmarket when the boundary was adjusted to follow the A14 bypass in 1993. The boundaries with Newmarket and Exning parishes follow the boundary between the counties of Cambridgeshire and Suffolk.

As elsewhere in England, a system of Hundreds covered Cambridgeshire until the 19th century. Burwell included the south-west edge of Staploe Hundred, along with the nearby parishes of Chippenham, Fordham, Isleham, Kennett, Landwade, Snailwell, Soham and Wicken.

East Cambridgeshire District Council came into being in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. Before the reorganisation, Burwell had lain inside Newmarket Rural District since 1894. Between 1875 and 1894, this was part of a larger Newmarket Rural Sanitary District which also encompassed Moulton Rural District in neighbouring West Suffolk.

The boundaries of Cambridgeshire itself also changed over the years up to 1974. Before Huntingdon and Peterborough joined the county in 1974, Burwell fell within Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely, covering the southern and eastern parts of today&#x27;s county. Between 1888 and 1965, the village fell within a smaller administrative county of Cambridgeshire, covering only the southern part of the present one.

==Geography==
===Climate===
===Clunch quarry===
Until the mid-20th century, a building material known as clunch – a soft rock which is one type of chalk limestone – was dug in Burwell. Remains of the open quarry can be seen either side of Bloomsfield. This was worked from 1252 to 1952 and used on many of the houses in Burwell. It remains the name of a local community magazine.

===Priory Wood===
Burwell has a small area of woodland planted in 1998 as a community project to mark the coming millennium. It is owned and maintained by the Woodland Trust. The official name comes from an ancient priory, which also gave its name to local roads such as Priory Close and Abbey Close.

==Culture and community==
===Carnival===
The village hosts an annual carnival in June, which raises money for charity. A parade travels from Margaret Field in the south of the village to the Recreational Ground, where stalls and fairground rides are present.

===Twinning===
The village is twinned with Lizy-sur-Ourcq and Mary-sur-Marne and with a small town, Ocquerre. All three are situated in France; Lizy is mentioned on signs as you enter the village. Visits from Burwell to the twins are organised by the Burwell Village Twinning Association.

A plate marking the twinning is located on a wall outside the Year 3 classroom at the village primary school, Burwell Village College (Primary).

===Philanthropy===

The villages holds an annual Christmas Eve fund raising event which is run by business executive James Pryor. The annual event raises money for local causes.

==Transport==

Road access to Burwell is mainly along the B1102 Cambridge to Mildenhall road, which runs the length of the village, and the B1103, which links the village with Newmarket. The A14 passes along the southernmost edge of Burwell parish on the Cambridgeshire–Suffolk border, but cannot be joined without leaving the parish.

Bus transport is provided by Stagecoach in Cambridge route 10 running through the village between Cambridge and Newmarket. Stagecoach took over what used to be Cambus in the mid-1990s, Cambus itself having split from the Eastern Counties Omnibus Company in 1984. Eastern Counties absorbed Burwell and District in 1979, the local bus company having provided transport to nearby Cambridge, Newmarket and Bury St Edmunds, and to destinations further afield, such as Great Yarmouth and Felixstowe.

Between 1884 and 1965, railway station, in the south of the village, was served by the Cambridge to Mildenhall railway. The station closed to passengers in 1962. Although nothing of it remains, its earlier presence is acknowledged in the names of the streets Railway Close and Station Gate. There was also a halt on Newmarket Road to the south-east of the village, where the B1103 still goes over a former railway bridge.

To the north of the village, temporary tramways provided access from the nearby Ipswich to Ely Line to the local brickworks, situated near the Lode.

Burwell Lode is navigable up to the edge of the village at Anchor Lane. The Lode joins Reach Lode in the north-west corner of the parish before they flow into the River Cam at Upware, 5 miles from Burwell.

==Education==
Burwell contains a nursery, a Montessori and a playgroup for pre-school children. The old school house on the High Street, a listed building dating from 1864, is now a private residence.

Children attend Burwell Village College (Primary) up to the age of 11 and then go to secondary schools at either Soham or Bottisham.

===Burwell Museum===
The museum shows life through the centuries on the edge of the Cambridgeshire fens. Opened in 1992, it occupies a collection of buildings, some reconstructed from other sites, such as an 18th-century timber-framed barn, and others built in local style mainly with reclaimed materials, such as the wagon sheds/granary display area.

The displays are set out as &quot;scenes&quot; (resembling stage sets) with groups of artefacts making up each, to give an idea of how, where and when items were used. Themes and exhibits cover agriculture, period rooms and household items, military life, a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, a reconstruction of a Roman potter&#x27;s workshop, a Victorian school room, and vintage vehicles, carts and farm equipment.

The museum is a regular venue for school trips. Eight local schoolchildren appeared in 2012 in a TV programme about the Cambridgeshire fens that was filmed here.

The neighbouring Grade II*-listed windmill, Stevens&#x27; Mill, forms part of the museum and opens with it. It was probably built about 1820. It stayed in the Carter family until 1884, when it was sold to George Mason, who had been the tenant miller. By the 1920s, the mill, at one time powered also by steam, was owned by the Stevens family. When Warren Stevens retired in 1955, the mill became redundant and fell into disrepair. The Burwell Museum obtained funding of £400,000 from Heritage Lottery Fund to restore it.

==Religion==

===Church of England===
Burwell has a large, Grade I-listed parish church in the High Street in the south of the village. Dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, the church is in Perpendicular Gothic style and dates back to the 15th century, although some parts are older. It has an active churchgoing membership of 50–70. The vicar since April 2011 is Rev. Dr Eleanor Williams.

===Baptist Church===
At the northern end of the village, Burwell has a Baptist church with a membership of about 50. Since May 2015, the minister has been Rev. Chris Johnson.

===Trinity Church===
Located near St Mary&#x27;s, Trinity is a small church founded by a merger of the Methodist and United Reformed communities in 1988. It has a regular congregation of about 20.

===Others===
The nearest Roman Catholic church is Our Lady and St Etheldreda in Newmarket. The village has a number of former churches converted to other uses. The large cemetery in Ness Road has a small non-denominational chapel.

==Sport==
Burwell Swifts F.C. play football in Division 1A of the &quot;NMC&quot; Cambridgeshire Football League, with a reserve team in Division 3B.

Burwell Tigers F.C. play association football in Division 5A of the &quot;NMC&quot; Cambridgeshire Football League.

The village is in the catchment areas of the &quot;Cambridge News&quot; and &quot;Newmarket Journal&quot; newspapers, and the radio stations BBC Radio Cambridgeshire and Heart East. For television Burwell is in the BBC East and ITV Anglia regions. Among several books on the village is an illustrated &quot;Memories of Burwell&quot; by Frank Czucha published in April 2017, available locally.Burwell Community Radio started broadcasting in 2020 and serves the village with a number of specialist music, documentary, interviews and community features.

<text>Flavian I of Antioch (, Greek: Φλαβιανός Α&#x27;; – February 404) was a Patriarch of Antioch from 381 until his death.

He was born about 320, most probably in Antioch. He inherited great wealth but resolved to devote his riches and his talents to the service of the church. In association with Diodore, afterwards bishop of Tarsus, he supported the orthodox Faith against the Arian heretic Leontius of Antioch, who had succeeded Eustathius of Antioch as Patriarch of Antioch. The two friends assembled their adherents outside the city walls for religious services (according to Theodoret, it was in these meetings that the practice of antiphonal singing was first introduced in the services of the church).

When Meletius of Antioch was appointed patriarch of Antioch in 360 he ordained Flavian to the priesthood, and on the death of Meletius in 381 Flavian was chosen to succeed him. The schism between the two parties was, however, far from being healed. The Bishop of Rome and the Patriarch of Alexandria refused to acknowledge Flavian I, and Paulinus II of Antioch, who by the extreme Eustathians had been elected patriarch in opposition to Meletius, continued to exercise authority over a portion of the church.

On the death of Paulinus II in 388, Evagrius was chosen as his successor. After the death of Evagrius, () Flavian succeeded in preventing the election of a successor, though the Eustathians still continued to hold separate meetings. Through the intervention of John Chrysostom soon after his elevation to the patriarchate of Constantinople in 398, and the influence of the emperor Theodosius I, Flavian I was acknowledged in 399 as the sole legitimate patriarch of Antioch.

Nevertheless, the Eustathian schism was not finally healed until 415 due to the reconciliation efforts of Alexander of Antioch (appointed patriarch in 414), successor to Porphyrus of Antioch. Flavian is posthumously venerated in both the Western and Eastern churches as a Saint.

<text>Clair Cameron Patterson (June 2, 1922 – December 5, 1995) was an American geochemist. Born in Mitchellville, Iowa, Patterson graduated from Grinnell College. He later received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and spent his entire professional career at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

In collaboration with George Tilton, Patterson developed the lead–lead dating method from the established procedures for uranium–lead dating. By using lead isotopic data from the Canyon Diablo meteorite, he calculated an age for the Earth of 4.55 billion years, a figure far more accurate than estimates existing at the time, and one that has remained largely unchallenged since 1956.

Patterson first encountered ubiquitous lead contamination in the late 1940s as a graduate student at the University of Chicago. Later, his work on this subject led to a total (US and worldwide) re-evaluation of the unregulated growth of concentrations of industrial lead in the atmosphere and in the human body. His activism about this problem proved seminal in the banning of &quot;leaded gasoline&quot;, as well as &quot;leaded solder&quot; in food cans.

==Early life==
Patterson was born in Mitchellville, Iowa. His father was a mail carrier, his mother was a member of the local school board. He had two siblings, a brother and a sister. From a young age he developed an intellectual curiosity and in 1939 he graduated high school at age 16. He then attended nearby Grinnell College, meeting his future wife, Lorna (Laurie) McCleary, there and graduating with a degree in chemistry in 1943. Both students attended graduate school at the University of Iowa, where he completed an M.A. in molecular spectroscopy and they married in 1944. Both were then employed on the Manhattan Project as civilians, first at the University of Chicago and then at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where he specialized in mass spectrometry.

After World War II, the Pattersons returned to Chicago, where Laurie worked as an infrared spectroscopist and supported Patterson while he studied for his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago under Harrison Brown. While conducting experiments in an old laboratory, Patterson uncovered &quot;the widespread presence of lead as a contaminant throughout the laboratory, including in his own hair.&quot; (This subject—the occurrence of lead broadly in the atmosphere and the environment—came to be a focus of study later in his career. His later work produced shocking results showing the ubiquitous presence of toxic lead in the broad environment.) After a postdoctoral year at Chicago, in 1952 Patterson moved with Brown to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, specifically to the (now) Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, where they served as founding members of Caltech&#x27;s new geochemistry program. He remained at Caltech for the rest of his life. He and Laurie had four children.

==Measurement of the Earth&#x27;s age==
Patterson&#x27;s postdoc work the University of Chicago was under Harrison Brown, who teamed him with George Tilton to study geological aging of zircon crystals. Zircon is extremely useful for geological dating: when forming, it collects tiny imperfections of uranium, but never lead. It follows that if lead is present in zircon, it must have come from decay of the uranium present. (The process is known as U-Pb dating.) The team measured the concentrations and isotopic compositions of foreign elements inside the zircon. Tilton measured the uranium and Patterson the types and amounts of lead. Patterson&#x27;s goal was to calculate the composition of primordial lead in the Earth. Then it would be possible to calculate the age of the Earth—and, in turn, of the solar system by using the same techniques on meteorites.

After beginning their work in 1948, Patterson soon noted that his lead samples were being contaminated. The age of the igneous rock from which the zircon came was known, and Tilton&#x27;s uranium measurements aligned with what was expected in the zircon at that particular age; but Patterson&#x27;s data typically was skewed with &quot;too much&quot; lead. After six years, the team published a paper on methods of determining the ages of zircon crystals and Patterson earned his Ph.D., but they were no closer in determining the age of the Earth.

Brown received a grant from the United States Atomic Energy Commission to continue work on dating the Earth, but more importantly, he was selected to commission a new mass spectrometer in Pasadena, California at Caltech. In 1953, Brown and Patterson arrived at Caltech, where Patterson was authorized to build his own lab from scratch. He proceeded to secure all points of entry from air and other contaminants. He acid-cleaned all apparatuses and even distilled all chemicals shipped to him. In essence, Patterson created one of the first laboratory clean rooms, here to prevent lead contamination of his work and his data. He finished his analysis the Canyon Diablo meteorite in 1953, and used the mass spectrometer at the Argonne National Laboratory on isolated iron-meteorite lead to collect data on the abundance of lead isotopes. With the new data, he published &quot;Age of Meteorites and the Earth&quot; in 1956, the first paper explaining the &quot;true&quot; age of the solar system&#x27;s accretion as 4.550Gy ± 70My; a figure that has remained largely unchallenged since.

Before his paper, it was largely believed the earth was around 3.3 billion years old. Patterson generously shared credit for the work with his colleagues.

==Tracing geochemical evolution of Earth==
Patterson&#x27;s ability to isolate quantities of lead at microgram levels from ordinary rocks and to determine their isotopic compositions enabled him to analyse for lead in sediment samples of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Deriving comparative bases from the different ages during which landmasses had drained into the oceans, he showed that the impact of anthropogenic lead being dispersed into the environment was more than 100 times the amount of lead leached naturally into the ocean by surface streams. To Patterson, the Earth&#x27;s geochemical cycle for lead appeared to be badly out of balance.

To work around the limitations of then-available analytic procedures Patterson developed new approaches. He found that in comparing similar metals such as barium, ocean waters contained up to 20 times more lead than ocean waters. Such evidence caused him to doubt the commonly held view that anthropogenic activities had increased lead concentrations only by a factor of (about) two over naturally occurring levels.

Patterson returned to the problem of his initial experiments and the contamination he had found in the blanks used for sampling. He determined—by analysing ice-core samples from Camp Century in Greenland taken in 1964 and from Antarctica in 1965—that atmospheric lead levels had begun to increase steadily and dangerously soon after tetraethyl lead (TEL) was introduced after being developed to reduce engine knock in internal combustion engines. Patterson then identified &#x27;leaded&#x27; engine fuels and the several other uses of lead in manufacturing as the cause of the contamination of his samples. Aware of the significant public-health implications of his findings, he devoted the rest of his life to eliminating lead from being introduced into the environment.

==Campaign against lead poisoning==

In 1965 Patterson published his paper &quot;Contaminated and Natural Lead Environments of Man&quot;, beginning his efforts to draw public attention to the problem of increasing lead levels in the environment including the food chain. He criticized the experimental methods of other scientists and thus encountered strong opposition from those then recognized as experts, including Robert A. Kehoe, a noted scientist and strong proponent of the lead producing manufacturers.

In his campaign to have lead removed from gasoline (petrol), Patterson took on the lobbying power of the Ethyl Corporation (which employed Kehoe), and the legacy of the late Thomas Midgley Jr. (who invented tetraethyllead (TEL) and chlorofluorocarbons), as well as the additive-lead industry as a whole. Following his criticism of the lead industry, he was refused contracts by several supposedly-neutral research organizations, including the United States Public Health Service. In 1971 he was excluded from a National Research Council (NRC) panel on atmospheric lead contamination, even though he was by then the foremost singular expert on the subject.

Following Kehoe&#x27;s arguments, observed levels of lead in blood, soil, or air were broadly referred to as &quot;normal&quot;, meaning values near the average; it was assumed that because these levels were common, they were harmless. &quot;Normal&quot; also carries some of the meaning &quot;natural&quot;. Patterson argued that the word &quot;normal&quot; should be replaced with &quot;typical&quot;, and that just because a certain level of lead was commonplace, it did not mean it was harmless. &quot;Natural&quot;, he insisted, was limited to concentrations of lead that existed before human activity produced significant lead contamination, which of late had occurred broadly—especially after the beginning of the industrial revolution.

In his ultraclean laboratory at Caltech, considered one of the first clean rooms, Patterson measured isotopic ratios in a setting free of the contamination that confounded the findings of Kehoe and others. Where Kehoe measured lead in (claimed) &quot;unexposed&quot; workers in a TEL plant and among Mexican farmers, Patterson studied mummies from before the Iron Age, and tuna raised from pelagic waters. Kehoe claimed, without offering evidence, that humans had adapted to increases of environmental lead. Patterson&#x27;s precise points were that humans had only increased the concentrations of lead, and that the short time span of higher exposure (a few thousand years) was only an instant in the Darwinian time scale—nowhere near the time needed to develop adaptive responses.

Patterson focused his attention and his advanced laboratory techniques on lead contamination in food, for which official testing data also reported marked increases. In one study, he showed an increase in lead levels from 0.3 ng/g to 1400 ng/g—in certain canned fish compared with fresh fish—where the official laboratory had reported an increase from 400 ng/g to 700 ng/g. He compared levels of lead, barium, and calcium in 1600-year-old Peruvian skeletons and showed a 700- to 1200-fold increase in lead levels of modern human bones, with no comparable changes in the barium and calcium levels.

Starting with the 1975 model year, the United States mandated the use of leaded gasoline to protect catalytic converters in all new cars. However, Patterson&#x27;s efforts achieved an accelerated phaseout of lead from standard automotive gasoline—but not all leaded fuels—in the United States by 1986. By the late 1990s lead levels in the blood of Americans were reported to have dropped by up to 80%.

In 1978, Patterson was appointed to a National Research Council panel that acknowledged many of the increases of lead contamination and the need for reductions, but some members argued for more research before recommending action. Patterson expressed his opinions in a 78-page minority report, which argued that control measures in certain sensitive sectors—including all leaded fuels, public water distribution systems, food containers, paints and glazes—should start immediately.

Patterson died in his home in Sea Ranch, California, at the age of 73 on December 5, 1995.

<text>The [[Patriarch of Antioch]] was the head of the Church of Antioch. According to tradition, the bishopric of Antioch was established by Saint Peter in the 1st century AD and was later elevated to the status of patriarchate by the First Council of Nicaea in 325. The church first underwent schism after the deposition of Eustathius in 330 over the issue of the Arian controversy and persisted until its resolution in 414.

After the Council of Chalcedon of 451, the church suffered division until the deposition of Patriarch Severus of Antioch in 518 resulted in a permanent schism from which two separate lines of patriarchs emerged. The Non-Chalcedonian supporters of Severus went on to form what is now known as the Syriac Orthodox Church, whilst the Chalcedonians developed the church now known as the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch.

<text>Roding Valley is a London Underground station. It is situated in Buckhurst Hill in the Epping Forest district of Essex, straddling the boundary between that council and Greater London (the London Borough of Redbridge). The station is on the Hainault loop of the Central line between Chigwell and Woodford stations. However, geographically it is midway between Woodford and Buckhurst Hill stations. The station is located between Station Way and Cherry Tree Rise (off Buckhurst Way). It has been in Travelcard Zone 4 since 2 January 2007.

With around million passenger journeys recorded in , Roding Valley is the Underground station and hence the station with the lowest annual patronage.

==Location==

It was originally named &quot;Roding Valley Halt&quot; (though while the full name appeared on tickets and timetables, the suffix &quot;Halt&quot; appeared on only some of the station signage), and was opened to serve new housing developments between Buckhurst Hill and Woodford. It was named after the River Roding which is close by, to the east. The track rises towards Chigwell and crosses the Roding over an impressive viaduct. Woodford Junction, where the Hainault branch leaves the main Central line to Epping, is very close to the station – Roding Valley&#x27;s platforms are visible from the train in either direction between Woodford and Buckhurst Hill (on the left of the train towards Woodford).

Roding Valley station has a very small catchment area, which explains its low usage. To the east is an undeveloped flood plain of the river Roding. A short distance to the north is Buckhurst Hill station. To the north-west is open space, while the areas to the south are served by Woodford station, which has a better train service. The station straddles the border between Redbridge and Epping Forest. The southern exit is in Redbridge, while the northern exit is in Epping Forest.

==History==
The tracks through Roding Valley were opened on 1 May 1903 by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on its Woodford to Ilford line (the Fairlop Loop). The station was not opened until 3 February 1936 by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER, successor to the GER).

As part of the 1935–1940 New Works Programme of the London Passenger Transport Board the majority of the Woodford to Ilford loop was to be transferred to form the eastern extensions of the Central line. Although work started in 1938 it was suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 and work was only resumed in 1946. In connection with the alterations required for the electrification of the line, the station was closed from 29 November 1947. It reopened, with its present name, and was first served by the Central line from 21 November 1948. The rather basic station buildings (all-wooden on the Woodford-bound side) were replaced by more substantial structures by 1949.

From the mid-1960s until the early 1990s the Woodford-Hainault section was largely operated separately from the rest of the Central line, using four-car (later three-car) trains of 1960 Stock. The three car units had a 1938 tube stock middle carriage. These trains were adapted for Automatic Train Operation (ATO): the Woodford-Hainault section became the testing ground for ATO on the Victoria line. Some Victoria line (1967 Stock) trains were also used to operate this section and named FACT, &quot;Fully Automatic Controlled Train&quot;. The separate operation has now been abolished, the 1960 Stock has been withdrawn and through trains to Central London now operate via Hainault. Because of this, it is normally quicker to travel to Woodford and change there, as trains to central London run frequently from that point. At the buildup to the peak periods, some trains starting from Hainault depot operate to central London via Grange Hill, Chigwell, Roding Valley and Woodford. This is done for operating convenience but passenger demand for these services is particularly high.

==The station today==
Roding Valley is the most lightly used station on the Underground. It is also one of the three tube stations not to have ticket barriers. The station underwent refurbishment in 2006 by Metronet.

==Services==
Roding Valley station is on the Hainault loop of the Central line between Chigwell to the west and Woodford to the east. The train service (which used to end at 8pm each day) has been extended to midnight to take into account the rising passenger numbers. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:

* 3 tph to Hainault
* 3 tph to Woodford

At morning rush hour, there are three trains that run to West Ruislip.

==Connections==
London Buses route 549 serves the station.

<doc id="239641" wikidata="Q433452" url="?curid=239641" title="Meletius of Antioch">
<text>Meletius of Antioch (Greek: Μελέτιος, &quot;Meletios&quot;) was a Christian patriarch of Antioch from 360 until his death in 381. He was opposed by a rival bishop named Paulinus II of Antioch and his episcopate was dominated by the schism, usually called the Meletian schism. As a result, he was exiled from Antioch in 361–362, 365–366 and 371–378. One of his last acts was to preside over the First Council of Constantinople in 381.

There are contrasting views about his theological position: on the one hand, he was exiled three times under Arian emperors; on the other, he was strongly opposed by those faithful to the memory of the staunchly pro-Nicene Eustathius of Antioch, whom the synod of Melitene deposed for his Homoousianism, which they considered a heresy, and by Saint Athanasius of Alexandria, a firm opponent of Arianism.

Meletius&#x27; asceticism was remarkable in view of his great private wealth. He is venerated as a saint and confessor in the Roman Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox churches. His feast day is 12 February.

== Bishop of Sebaste ==
Meletius was born at Melitene in Lesser Armenia of wealthy and noble parents. He first appears around 357 as a supporter of Acacius, bishop of Caesarea, the leader of that local faction that supported the Homoean formula, which says that the Son is like the Father without reference to essence or substance. In contrast, the Homoiousians held that God and Jesus Christ are of &quot;like&quot; essence and the Homoousians that they are, as stated in the Nicene Creed, of the &quot;same&quot; essence. Meletius thus first appears as an ecclesiastic of the court party, and as such became bishop of Sebaste in succession to Eustathius of Sebaste. The appointment was resented by the Homoousian clergy, and Meletius resigned the see.

== Patriarch of Antioch ==
=== First period and exile ===
According to Socrates Scholasticus, Meletius attended the council of Seleucia in the autumn of 359 and then subscribed to the Acacian (Homoean) formula. Early in 360 he became patriarch of Antioch, succeeding Eudoxius of Antioch, who had been translated to the see of Constantinople. Early the following year (361), he was in exile. According to an old tradition, supported by evidence drawn from Epiphanius of Cyprus and John Chrysostom, this was due to a sermon preached before the emperor Constantius II, in which he revealed Homoousian views. This explanation, however, is rejected by G. F. Loofs on the grounds that the sermon contains nothing inconsistent with the Acacian position favoured by the court party; on the other hand, there is evidence of conflicts with the clergy, quite apart from any questions of orthodoxy, which may have led to the patriarch&#x27;s deposition. Meletius believed that truth lay in delicate distinctions, but his formula was so indefinite that it is difficult to grasp it with precision. He was neither a thorough Nicene nor a decided Arian.

The Eustathians elected as rival patriarch the presbyter Paulinus. The synod of Alexandria (362) sent deputies to attempt an arrangement between the two anti-Arian churches, but before they arrived Paulinus had been consecrated patriarch by Lucifer of Cagliari. When in consequence of the emperor Julian&#x27;s contemptuous policy Meletius returned, he found himself as one of three rival bishops.

The Meletian Schism was a dispute in Antioch between two pro-Nicene groups; the Meletians, who maintained that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three hypostases, and the older pro-Nicene group, the Eustathians, who preferred the language of a single hypostasis and described the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three prosopa. Basil of Caesarea objected that the Sabellians also used this term and that it does not make sufficient distinction between the Persons. Basil wrote:
&quot;It is not enough to count differences in the prosōpa. It is necessary also to confess that each prosōpon exists in a true hypostasis. The mirage of prosōpa without hypostaseis is not denied even by Sabellius, who said that the same God, though he is one subject, is transformed according to the need of each occasion and is thus spoken of now as Father, now as Son, and now as Holy Spirit&quot;. (Epistle 210.5.36–41.)

Philip Schaff summarized the Meletian Schism as follows:
&quot;The doctrinal difference between the Meletians and the old Nicenes consisted chiefly in this: that the latter acknowledged three hypostases in the divine trinity, the former only three prosopa; the one laying the stress on the triplicity of the divine essence, the other on its unity&quot;.

=== Second and third exiles ===
Athanasius of Alexandria came to Antioch by order of the emperor, and expressed to Meletius his wish of entering into communion with him. Meletius, ill-advised, delayed answering him, and Athanasius went away having admitted Paulinus, whom he had not yet recognized as patriarch, to his communion. The orthodox Nicene party, notably Athanasius himself, held communion with Paulinus only. Twice, in 365 and 371 or 372, Meletius was exiled by decree of the Arian emperor Valens. A further complication was added when, in 375, Vitalius, one of Meletius&#x27; presbyters, was consecrated patriarch by the heretical bishop Apollinaris of Laodicea. After the death of Valens in 378, the Western emperor Gratian removed Euzoius from Antioch, handing over the churches to Meletius. Theodosius I, the new emperor in the East, also favoured Meletius, who had been more and more approximating to the views of the Nicene Creed.

=== Triumph ===
Upon his return to Antioch, Meletius was hailed as the leader of orthodoxy. As such he presided in October 379 over the great synod of Antioch, in which the dogmatic agreement of East and West was established. He helped Gregory of Nazianzus to the see of Constantinople and also presided over the First Council of Constantinople, the second ecumenical council, in 381. Paulinus, however, was the man favoured by Rome and Alexandria. Jerome accompanied Paulinus back to Rome in order to secure him more support.

Meanwhile, Ambrose, bishop of Milan, was dealing with Arians in the West. He persuaded Gratian to call a church synod. The Council of Aquileia (381) deposed two bishops of the eastern province of Dacia, Palladius of Ratiaria and Secundianus of Singidunum, and requested the emperors Theodosius and Gratian to convene at Alexandria a general council of all bishops in order to put an end to the Meletian schism at Antioch. 

The two remaining factions which divided the Antiochene Church were Orthodox, the supporters of Meletius and the adherents of Paulinus. Uniting them was a difficult move. A temporary pacification ensued when six of the leading presbyters took an oath not to seek episcopal consecration themselves but to accept as patriarch of Antioch whichever of the two rivals outlived the other.

== Schism after his death ==
Meletius died soon after the opening of the First Council of Constantinople and the emperor Theodosius, who had received him with special distinction, ordered his body to be carried to Antioch and buried with the honours of a saint. The Meletian schism, however, did not end immediately with his death. In spite of the advice of Gregory of Nazianzus, Paulinus was not recognized as the sole patriarch and Flavian was consecrated as Meletius&#x27; successor.

The Eustathians, on the other hand, elected Evagrius of Antioch as patriarch on Paulinus II&#x27;s death in 388. In 399, John Chrysostom, who had been ordained a deacon by Meletius, but later separated from his group and accepted ordination to the priesthood at the hands of Evagrius, secured reconciliation between Flavian and the sees of Alexandria and Rome. However, it would take the Eustathians at Antioch until 415 to accept Flavian.

It was built in 1754 during the French and Indian War, and is now a National Historic Landmark and local historic site owned by the city. Its main building, the only original element of the fort to survive, was restored in 1920 and now depicts its original use as a trading post.

== French and Indian War ==

Fort Western was built by a Boston land company (the Kennebec Proprietors) in 1754 as a fortified trading post, and to promote settlement in the area. The fort was a log palisade with blockhouses which protected a store and warehouse. It was never directly attacked. From a high elevation a large rectangular enclosure commanded the river for more than a mile. Blockhouses 24 feet square and watch-boxes 12 feet square guarded opposite corners, and within stood a two-story main house . After the war ended, James Howard, its last commander, purchased the fort and operated the trading post.

==American Revolution==
After 1769, Fort Western fell into decay. In 1775, Benedict Arnold&#x27;s expedition to Quebec stopped at Fort Western long enough to repair bateaux. Arnold, Daniel Morgan, Roger Enos, and Aaron Burr stayed as guests in the garrison while their force camped outside. Fort Western was the starting point for the march through the wilderness to Quebec.

==Old Fort Western==
The main building of the fort eventually passed out of the Howard family, and was converted into a tenement house. It was repurchased in Howard family descendants in 1919, and restored the following year, which included the construction of two new blockhouses and a stockade. The stockade was again rebuilt in 1960. Today its main building is a little-altered example of an 18th-century trading post. The fort and store are maintained as a museum and are open to the public during the summer months.

The fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973.

<doc id="239644" wikidata="Q1655364" url="?curid=239644" title="Iago">
<text>Iago () is a fictional character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; (c. 1601–1604). Iago is the play&#x27;s main antagonist, and Othello&#x27;s standard-bearer. He is the husband of Emilia who is in turn the attendant of Othello&#x27;s wife Desdemona. Iago hates Othello and devises a plan to destroy him by making him believe that Desdemona is having an affair with his lieutenant, Michael Cassio.

The role is thought to have been first played by Robert Armin, who typically played intelligent clown roles like Touchstone in &quot;As You Like It&quot; and Feste in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

==Role in the play==
Iago is a soldier who has fought beside Othello for several years, and has become his trusted advisor. At the beginning of the play, Iago claims to have been unfairly passed over for promotion to the rank of Othello&#x27;s lieutenant in favour of Michael Cassio. Iago plots to manipulate Othello into demoting Cassio, and thereafter to bring about the downfall of Othello himself and also others in the play who trusted Iago. He has an ally, Roderigo, who assists him in his plans in the mistaken belief that after Othello is gone, Iago will help Roderigo earn the affection of Othello&#x27;s wife, Desdemona. After Iago engineers a drunken brawl to ensure Cassio&#x27;s demotion (in Act 2), he sets to work on his second scheme: leading Othello to believe that Desdemona is having an affair with Cassio. This plan occupies the final three acts of the play.

He manipulates his wife Emilia, Desdemona&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, into taking from Desdemona a handkerchief that Othello had given her; he then tells Othello that he had seen it in Cassio&#x27;s possession. Once Othello flies into a jealous rage, Iago tells him to hide and look on while he (Iago) talks to Cassio. Iago then leads Othello to believe that a bawdy conversation about Cassio&#x27;s mistress, Bianca, is in fact about Desdemona. Mad with jealousy, Othello orders Iago to kill Cassio, promising to make him lieutenant in return. Iago then engineers a fight between Cassio and Roderigo in which the latter is killed (by Iago himself, double-crossing his ally), but the former merely wounded.

Iago&#x27;s plan appears to succeed when Othello kills Desdemona, who is innocent of Iago&#x27;s charges. Soon afterwards, however, Emilia brings Iago&#x27;s treachery to light, and Iago kills her in a fit of rage before being arrested. He remains famously reticent when pressed for an explanation of his actions before he is arrested: &quot;Demand me nothing. What you know, you know. From this time forth I never will speak word.&quot; Following Othello&#x27;s suicide, Cassio, now in charge, condemns Iago to be imprisoned and tortured as punishment for his crimes.

==Description of character==
Iago is one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most sinister villains, often considered such because of the unique trust that Othello places in him, which he betrays while maintaining his reputation for honesty and dedication. Shakespeare contrasts Iago with Othello&#x27;s nobility and integrity. With 1,097 lines, Iago has more lines in the play than Othello himself.

Iago is a Machiavellian schemer and manipulator, as he is often referred to as &quot;honest Iago&quot;, displaying his skill at deceiving other characters so that not only do they not suspect him, but they count on him as the person most likely to be truthful.

Shakespearean critic A. C. Bradley said that &quot;evil has nowhere else been portrayed with such mastery as in the evil character of Iago&quot;, and also states that he &quot;stands supreme among Shakespeare&#x27;s evil characters because the greatest intensity and subtlety of imagination have gone into his making.&quot; The mystery surrounding Iago&#x27;s actual motives continues to intrigue readers and fuel scholarly debate.

==Critical discussion==
In discussing &quot;The Tragedy of Othello&quot;, scholars have long debated Iago&#x27;s role—highlighting the complexity of his character and manipulativeness. Fred West contends that Shakespeare was not content with simply portraying another &quot;stock&quot; morality figure, and that he, like many dramatists, was particularly interested in the workings of the human mind. Thus, according to West, Iago, who sees nothing wrong with his own behaviour, is &quot;an accurate portrait of a psychopath&quot;, who is &quot;devoid of conscience, with no remorse&quot;. 

Bradley writes that Iago &quot;illustrates in the most perfect combination the two facts concerning evil, which seem to have impressed Shakespeare the most&quot;, the first being that &quot;the fact that perfectly sane people exist in whom fellow-feeling of any kind is so weak that an almost absolute egoism becomes possible to them&quot;, with the second being &quot;that such evil is compatible, and even appears to ally itself easily, with exceptional powers of will and intellect&quot;. The same critic also famously said that &quot;to compare Iago with the Satan of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; seems almost absurd, so immensely does Shakespeare&#x27;s man exceed Milton&#x27;s Fiend in evil&quot;.

Weston Babcock, however, would have readers see Iago as a &quot;human being, shrewdly intelligent, suffering from and striking against a constant fear of social snobbery&quot;. According to Babcock, it is not malice, but fear, that drives Iago. For, &quot;Iago dates his maturity, as he considers it, his ability to understand the world, from the age at which he recognized every remark to be personally pointed. One only who lacks inner assurance and is so constantly on guard against any hint of his inferiority could so confess himself&quot;.

John Draper, on the other hand, postulates that Iago is simply &quot;an opportunist who cleverly grasps occasion&quot; (726), spurred on by &quot;the keenest of professional and personal motives&quot;. Draper argues that Iago &quot;seized occasions rather than made them&quot;. According to his theory, Iago &quot;is the first cause, but events, once under way, pass out of his control&quot;. Following this logic, Draper concludes that Iago &quot;is neither as clever nor as wicked as some would think; and the problem of his character largely resolves itself into the question: was he justified in embarking upon the initial stages of his revenge?&quot;

==Motives==

Iago has been described as a &quot;motiveless malignity&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. This reading would seem to suggest that Iago, much like Don John in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; or Aaron in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, wreaks havoc on the other characters&#x27; lives for no ulterior purpose.

Léone Teyssandier writes that a possible motive for Iago&#x27;s actions is envy towards Desdemona, Cassio and Othello; Iago sees them as more noble, generous and, in the case of Cassio, more handsome than he is. In particular, he sees the death of Cassio as a necessity, saying of him that &quot;He hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly&quot;.

Andy Serkis, who in 2002 portrayed Iago at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, wrote in his memoir &quot;Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic&quot;, that: 

Iago reveals his true nature only in his soliloquies, and in occasional asides. Elsewhere, he is charismatic and friendly, and the advice he offers to both Cassio and Othello is superficially sound; as Iago himself remarks: &quot;And what&#x27;s he then, that says I play the villain, when this advice is free I give, and honest...?&quot;

It is this dramatic irony that drives the play.

In Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, an 1887 operatic adaptation of the play, Iago reveals his theology in his Act II aria &quot;Credo in un dio crudel&quot;, which has no counterpart in Shakespeare&#x27;s original: he does believe in a god, but a cruel god who created him in his likeness and that the evil he does is to fulfill his destiny. He also enunciates in the aria that he believes an honest man to be a mocking actor about whom everything is a lie and that mankind is simply a joke of fate.
