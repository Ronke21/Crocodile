<text>Power-line communication (PLC) is the carrying of data on a conductor that is also used simultaneously for AC electric power transmission or electric power distribution to consumers. The line that does so is known as a power-line carrier.

In the past, power lines were solely used for transmitting electricity. However, with the introduction of advanced networking technologies, there has been a push for utility and service providers to find cost-effective and high-performance solutions. The possibility of using powerlines as a universal medium to transmit not just electricity or control signals, but also high-speed data and multimedia, is now under investigation.

A wide range of power-line communication technologies are needed for different applications, ranging from home automation to Internet access, which is often called broadband over power lines (BPL). Most PLC technologies limit themselves to one type of wires (such as premises wiring within a single building), but some can cross between two levels (for example, both the distribution network and premises wiring). Typically transformers prevent propagating the signal, which requires multiple technologies to form very large networks. Various data rates and frequencies are used in different situations.

A number of difficult technical problems are common between wireless and power-line communication, notably those of spread spectrum radio signals operating in a crowded environment. Radio interference, for example, has long been a concern of amateur radio groups.

== Basics ==
Power-line communications systems operate by adding a modulated carrier signal to the wiring system. Different types of power-line communications use different frequency bands. Since the power distribution system was originally intended for transmission of AC power at typical frequencies of 50 or 60 Hz, power wire circuits have only a limited ability to carry higher frequencies. The propagation problem is a limiting factor for each type of power-line communications.

The main issue determining the frequencies of power-line communication is laws to limit interference with radio services. Many nations regulate unshielded wired emissions as if they were radio transmitters. These jurisdictions usually require unlicensed uses to be below 500 kHz or in unlicensed radio bands. Some jurisdictions (such as the EU), regulate wire-line transmissions further. The U.S. is a notable exception, permitting limited-power wide-band signals to be injected into unshielded wiring, as long as the wiring is not designed to propagate radio waves in free space.

Data rates and distance limits vary widely over many power-line communication standards. Low-frequency (about 100–200 kHz) carriers impressed on high-voltage transmission lines may carry one or two analog voice circuits, or telemetry and control circuits with an equivalent data rate of a few hundred bits per second; however, these circuits may be many miles long. Higher data rates generally imply shorter ranges; a local area network operating at millions of bits per second may only cover one floor of an office building, but eliminates the need for installation of dedicated network cabling.

== Types of PLC ==
Although different protocols and legislation exists throughout the world, there are basically only two types of PLC: the &quot;indoor&quot; PLC and the &quot;outdoor&quot; PLC.

* Indoor PLC: indoor PLC is used for LAN networking and narrowband in-house applications, such as home automation. It uses house power wiring to transmit data, injecting the current directly in the power plugs.
* Outdoor PLC: applied in the main power line transmissions, such as low-frequency PLC (for telemetry and grid control), and in BPL, for internet transmission via power network. In this type of PLC, the equipment must be robust, to deal with the high voltage levels of the power lines.

== Ripple control ==
Ripple control adds an audio-frequency tone to an AC line. Typical frequencies are from 100 to 2400 Hz. Each district usually has its own frequency, so that adjacent areas are unaffected. Codes are sent by slowly turning the tone on and off. Equipment at a customer site receives the codes, and turns customer equipment off and on. Often the decoder is part of a standard electricity meter, and controls relays. There are also utility codes, e.g. to set the clocks of the power meters at midnight.

In this way, the utility can avoid up to 20% of capital expenses for generating equipment. This lowers costs for electricity and fuel usage. Brownouts and rolling blackouts are more easily prevented. Grids that use cogeneration can enable auxiliary customer equipment when the generators are being run to generate heat rather than electricity.

An annoyance for customers is that sometimes the code to turn equipment on is lost, or load shedding is inconvenient or dangerous. For example, during a party, a dangerous heat wave or when life-preserving medical equipment is on-site. To handle these cases, some equipment includes switches to circumvent load shedding. Some meters switch into a higher billing rate when the &quot;party switch&quot; is flipped.

== Long haul, low frequency ==
Utility companies use special coupling capacitors to connect radio transmitters and receivers to the AC power-carrying conductors. Power meters often use small transformers with linear amplifiers in the range of tens of watts. Most of the expense of any PLC system is the power electronics. By comparison, the electronics to encode and decode is usually small, in a special-purpose integrated circuit. Thus even the complicated OFDM standards can still be economical.

Frequencies used are in the range of 24 to 500 kHz, with transmitter power levels up to hundreds of watts. These signals may be impressed on one conductor, on two conductors or on all three conductors of a high-voltage AC transmission line. Several PLC channels may be coupled onto one HV line. Filtering devices are applied at substations to prevent the carrier frequency current from being bypassed through the station apparatus and to ensure that distant faults do not affect the isolated segments of the PLC system. These circuits are used for control of switchgear, and for protection of transmission lines. For example, a protective relay can use a PLC channel to trip a line if a fault is detected between its two terminals but to leave the line in operation if the fault is elsewhere on the system.

While utility companies use microwave and now, increasingly, fiber-optic cables for their primary system communication needs, the power-line carrier apparatus may still be useful as a backup channel or for very simple low-cost installations that do not warrant installing fiber optic lines, or which are inaccessible to radio or other communication.

Power-line carrier communication (PLCC) is mainly used for telecommunication, tele-protection and tele-monitoring between electrical substations through power lines at high voltages, such as 110 kV, 220 kV, 400 kV.

The modulation generally used in these system is amplitude modulation. The carrier frequency range is used for audio signals, protection and a pilot frequency. The pilot frequency is a signal in the audio range that is transmitted continuously for failure detection.

The voice signal is compressed and filtered into the 300 Hz to 4000 Hz range, and this audio frequency is mixed with the carrier frequency. The carrier frequency is again filtered, amplified and transmitted. The transmission power of these HF carrier frequencies will be in the range of 0 to +32 dbW. This range is set according to the distance between substations.

PLCC can be used for interconnecting private branch exchanges (PBXs).

To sectionalize the transmission network and protect against failures, a &quot;wave trap&quot; is connected in series with the power (transmission) line. They consist of one or more sections of resonant circuits, which block the high-frequency carrier waves (24–500 kHz) and let power frequency current (50–60 Hz) pass through. Wave traps are used in the switchyards of most power stations to prevent carriers from entering the station equipment. Each wave trap has a lightning arrester to protect it from surge voltages.

A coupling capacitor is used to connect the transmitters and receivers to the high-voltage line. This provides a low-impedance path for carrier energy to HV line but blocks the power frequency circuit by being a high-impedance path. The coupling capacitor may be part of a capacitor voltage transformer used for voltage measurement.

Power-line carrier systems have long been a favorite at many utilities because it allows them to reliably move data over an infrastructure that they control.

A &quot;PLC carrier repeating station&quot; is a facility, at which a power-line communication (PLC) signal on a powerline is refreshed. Therefore
the signal is filtered out from the powerline, demodulated and modulated on a new carrier frequency, and then reinjected onto the powerline again. As PLC signals can carry long distances (several hundred kilometers), such facilities only exist on very long power lines using PLC equipment.

PLC is one of the technologies used for automatic meter reading. Both one-way and two-way systems have been successfully used for decades. Interest in this application has grown substantially in recent history—not so much because there is an interest in automating a manual process, but because there is an interest in obtaining fresh data from all metered points in order to better control and operate the system. PLC is one of the technologies being used in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems.

In a one-way (inbound only) system, readings bubble up from end devices (such as meters), through the communication infrastructure, to a &quot;master station&quot; which publishes the readings. A one-way system might be lower-cost than a two-way system, but also is difficult to reconfigure should the operating environment change.

In a two-way system (supporting both outbound and inbound), commands can be broadcast out from the master station to end devices (meters) – allowing for reconfiguration of the network, or to obtain readings, or to convey messages, etc. The device at the end of the network may then respond (inbound) with a message that carries the desired value. Outbound messages injected at a utility substation will propagate to all points downstream. This type of broadcast allows the communication system to simultaneously reach many thousands of devices—all of which are known to have power, and have been previously identified as candidates for load shed. PLC also may be a component of a smart grid.

== Medium frequency (100 kHz) ==
These systems are often used in countries in which it is illegal to transmit signals that interfere with normal radio. The frequencies are so low that they are unable to start radio waves when sent over the utility wiring.

=== Home control (narrowband) ===
Power-line communications technology can use the electrical power wiring within a home for home automation: for example, remote control of lighting and appliances without installation of additional control wiring.

Typically home-control power-line communication devices operate by modulating in a carrier wave of between 20 and 200 kHz into the household wiring at the transmitter. The carrier is modulated by digital signals. Each receiver in the system has an address and can be individually commanded by the signals transmitted over the household wiring and decoded at the receiver. These devices may be either plugged into regular power outlets or permanently wired in place. Since the carrier signal may propagate to nearby homes (or apartments) on the same distribution system, these control schemes have a &quot;house address&quot; that designates the owner. A popular technology known as X10 has been used since the 1970s.

The universal powerline bus, introduced in 1999, uses pulse-position modulation (PPM). The physical layer method is a very different scheme than the X10. LonTalk, part of the LonWorks home automation product line, was accepted as part of some automation standards.

=== Low-speed narrow-band ===
Narrowband power-line communications began soon after electrical power supply became widespread. Around the year 1922 the first carrier frequency systems began to operate over high-tension lines with frequencies of 15 to 500 kHz for telemetry purposes, and this continues. Consumer products such as baby alarms have been available at least since 1940.

In the 1930s, ripple carrier signaling was introduced on the medium (10–20 kV) and low voltage (240/415 V) distribution systems.

For many years the search continued for a cheap bi-directional technology suitable for applications such as remote meter reading. French electric power &quot;Électricité de France&quot; (EDF) prototyped and standardized a system called spread frequency shift keying or S-FSK. (See IEC 61334) It is now a simple, low cost system with a long history, however it has a very slow transmission rate. In the 1970s, the Tokyo Electric Power Company ran experiments that reported successful bi-directional operation with several hundred units. the system was widely used in Italy and some other parts of the EU.

S-FSK sends a burst of 2, 4 or 8 tones centered around the time when the AC line passes through zero voltage. In this way, the tones avoid most radio-frequency noise from arcing. (It is common for dirty insulators to arc at the highest point of the voltage, and thus generate a wide-band burst of noise.) To avoid other interference, receivers can improve their signal-to-noise ratio by measuring the power of only the &quot;1&quot; tones, only the &quot;0&quot; tones or the differential power of both. Different districts use different tone pairs to avoid interference. The bit timing is typically recovered from the boundaries between tones, in a way similar to a UART. Timing is roughly centered on the zero crossing with a timer from the previous zero crossing. Typical speeds are 200 to 1200 bits per second, with one bit per tone slot. Speeds also depend on the AC line frequency. The speed is limited by noise, and the jitter of the AC line&#x27;s zero crossing, which is affected by local loads. These systems are usually bidirectional, with both meters and central stations sending data and commands. Higher levels of the protocols can have stations (usually smart meters) retransmit messages. (See IEC 61334)

Since the mid-1980s, there has been a surge of interest in using the potential of digital communications techniques and digital signal processing. The drive is to produce a reliable system that is cheap enough to be widely installed and able to compete cost effectively with wireless solutions. But the narrowband powerline communications channel presents many technical challenges, a mathematical channel model and a survey of work is available.

Applications of mains communications vary enormously, as would be expected of such a widely available medium. One natural application of narrow-band power-line communication is the control and telemetry of electrical equipment such as meters, switches, heaters and domestic appliances. A number of active developments are considering such applications from a systems point of view, such as demand side management. In this, domestic appliances would intelligently co-ordinate their use of resources, for example limiting peak loads.

Control and telemetry applications include both &quot;utility side&quot; applications, which involve equipment belonging to the utility company up to the domestic meter, and &quot;consumer-side&quot; applications which involve equipment in the consumer&#x27;s premises. Possible utility-side applications include automatic meter reading (AMR), dynamic tariff control, load management, load profile recording, credit control, pre-payment, remote connection, fraud detection and network management, and could be extended to include gas and water.

Open Smart Grid Protocol (OSGP) is one of the most proven narrowband PLC technologies and protocols for smart metering. There are more than five million smart meters, based on OSGP and using BPSK PLC, installed and operating around the World. The OSGP Alliance, a non-profit association originally established as ESNA in 2006, led an effort to establish a family of specifications published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) used in conjunction with the ISO/IEC 14908 control networking standard for smart grid applications. OSGP is optimized to provide reliable and efficient delivery of command and control information for smart meters, direct load control modules, solar panels, gateways, and other smart grid devices. OSGP follows a modern, structured approach based on the OSI protocol model to meet the evolving challenges of the smart grid.

At the physical layer, OSGP currently uses ETSI 103 908 as its technology standard. This uses binary phase shift keying at 3592.98 BAUD, using a carrier tone of 86.232 KHz +/- 200ppm. (Note: The bit clock is almost exactly 1/24 of the carrier.) At the OSGP application layer, ETSI TS 104 001 provides a table-oriented data storage based, in part, on the ANSI C12.19 / MC12.19 / 2012 / IEEE Std 1377 standards for Utility Industry End Device Data Tables and ANSI C12.18 / MC12.18 / IEEE Std 1701, for its services and payload encapsulation. This standard and command system provides not only for smart meters and related data but also for general-purpose extension to other smart grid devices.

A project of EDF, France includes demand management, street lighting control, remote metering and billing, customer-specific tariff optimization, contract management, expense estimation and gas applications safety.

There are also many specialized niche applications that use the mains supply within the home as a convenient data link for telemetry. For example, in the UK and Europe a TV audience monitoring system uses powerline communications as a convenient data path between devices that monitor TV viewing activity in different rooms in a home and a data concentrator which is connected to a telephone modem.

=== Medium-speed narrow-band ===
The Distribution Line Carrier (DLC) System technology used a frequency range of 9 to 500 kHz with data rate up to .

A project called Real-time Energy Management via Powerlines and Internet (REMPLI) was funded from 2003 to 2006 by the European Commission.

More modern systems use OFDM to send data at faster bit rates without causing radio frequency interference. These utilize hundreds of slowly-sending data channels. Usually, they can adapt to noise by turning off channels with interference. The extra expense of the encoding devices is minor compared to the cost of the electronics to transmit. The transmission electronics is usually a high-power operational amplifier, a coupling transformer and a power supply. Similar transmission electronics is required on older, slower systems, so with improved technology, improved performance can be very affordable.

In 2009, a group of vendors formed the PoweRline Intelligent Metering Evolution (PRIME) alliance. As delivered, the physical layer is OFDM, sampled at 250 kHz, with 512 differential phase shift keying channels from 42–89 kHz. Its fastest transmission rate is , while its most robust is . It uses a convolutional code for error detection and correction. The upper layer is usually IPv4.

In 2011, several companies including distribution network operators (ERDF, Enexis), meter vendors (Sagemcom, Landis&amp;Gyr) and chip vendors (Maxim Integrated, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Renesas) founded the G3-PLC Alliance to promote G3-PLC technology. G3-PLC is the low-layer protocol to enable large scale infrastructure on the electrical grid. G3-PLC may operate on CENELEC A band (35 to 91 kHz) or CENELEC B band (98 kHz to 122 kHz) in Europe, on ARIB band (155 kHz to 403 kHz) in Japan and on FCC (155 kHz to 487 kHz) for the US and the rest of the world. The technology used is OFDM sampled at 400 kHz with adaptative modulation and tone mapping. Error detection and correction is made by both a convolutional code and Reed-Solomon error correction. The required media access control is taken from IEEE 802.15.4, a radio standard. In the protocol, 6loWPAN has been chosen to adapt IPv6 an internet network layer to constrained environments which is Power line communications. 6loWPAN integrates routing, based on the mesh network LOADng, header compression, fragmentation and security. G3-PLC has been designed for extremely robust communication based on reliable and highly secured connections between devices, including crossing Medium Voltage to Low Voltage transformers. With the use of IPv6, G3-PLC enables communication between meters, grid actuators as well as smart objects. In December 2011, G3 PLC technology was recognized as an international standard at ITU in Geneva where it is referenced as G.9903, Narrowband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing power line communication transceivers for G3-PLC networks.

=== Transmitting radio programs ===

Sometimes PLC was used for transmitting radio programs over powerlines. When operated in the AM radio band, it is known as a carrier current system.

== High frequency (≥ 1 MHz) ==
High-frequency communication may (re)use large portions of the radio spectrum for communication, or may use select (narrow) band(s), depending on the technology.

=== Home networking (LAN) ===
Power line communications can also be used in a home to interconnect home computers and peripherals, and home entertainment devices that have an Ethernet port. Powerline adapter sets plug into power outlets to establish an Ethernet connection using the existing electrical wiring in the home (power strips with filtering may absorb the power line signal). This allows devices to share data without the inconvenience of running dedicated network cables.

The widely deployed powerline networking standard are from Nessum Alliance and HomePlug Powerline Alliance. HomePlug Powerline Alliance announced in October 2016 that it would wind down its activities, and the Alliance website (homeplug.org) has been closed. Nessum (formerly HD-PLC), and HomePlug AV which is the most current of the HomePlug specifications were adopted by the IEEE 1901 group as baseline technologies for their standard, published 30 December 2010. HomePlug estimates that over 45 million HomePlug devices have been deployed worldwide. Other companies and organizations back different specifications for power line home networking and these include the Universal Powerline Association, SiConnect, Xsilon, and the ITU-T&#x27;s G.hn (HomeGrid) specification.

=== Non-home networking (LAN) ===
With the diversification of IoT applications, the demand for high-speed data communication such as transmission of high-definition video data and/or high-frequent sensor data is increasing in the field of smart building, smart factory, smart city, etc. In such use cases, power line communication technologies can also be used and provides the same advantage of reusing existing cables.

Nessum has developed a multi-hop technology that can be used to build large-scale networks. In addition, the latest Nessum technology (4th-generation HD-PLC technology) provides multiple channels, which enables high-speed and long-range communication by selecting the optimal channel.

===Broadband over power line===
Broadband over power line (BPL) is a system to transmit two-way data over existing AC MV (medium voltage) electrical distribution wiring, between transformers, and AC LV (low voltage) wiring between transformer and customer outlets (typically 100 to 240 V). This avoids the expense of a dedicated network of wires for data communication, and the expense of maintaining a dedicated network of antennas, radios and routers in a wireless network.

BPL uses some of the same radio frequencies used for over-the-air radio systems. Modern BPL employs Wavelet-OFDM, FFT-OFDM, or frequency-hopping spread spectrum to avoid using those frequencies actually in use, though early pre-2010 BPL standards did not. The criticisms of BPL from this perspective are of pre-OPERA, pre-1905 standards.

The BPL OPERA standard is used primarily in Europe by ISPs. In North America, it is used in some places (Washington Island, WI, for instance) but is more generally used by electric distribution utilities for smart meters and load management.

Since the ratification of the IEEE 1901 (Nessum, HomePlug) LAN standard and its widespread implementation in mainstream router chipsets, the older BPL standards are not competitive for communication between AC outlets within a building, nor between the building and the transformer where MV meets LV lines.

==Ultra-high frequency (≥ 100 MHz)==
Even higher information rate transmissions over power line use RF through microwave frequencies transmitted via a transverse mode surface wave propagation mechanism that requires only a single conductor. An implementation of this technology is marketed as E-Line. These use microwaves instead of the lower frequency bands, up to 2–20 GHz. While these may interfere with radio astronomy when used outdoors, the advantages of speeds competitive with fiber optic cables without new wiring are likely to outweigh that.

These systems claim symmetric and full duplex communication in excess of in each direction. Multiple Wi-Fi channels with simultaneous analog television in the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz unlicensed bands have been demonstrated operating over a single medium voltage line conductor. Because the underlying propagation mode is extremely broadband (in the technical sense), it can operate anywhere in the 20 MHz20 GHz region. Also since it is not restricted to below 80 MHz, as is the case for high-frequency BPL, these systems can avoid the interference issues associated with use of shared spectrum with other licensed or unlicensed services.

== Standards ==
Two distinctly different sets of standards apply to powerline networking as of early 2010.

Within homes, the IEEE 1901 standards specify how, globally, existing AC wires should be employed for data purposes. The IEEE 1901 includes Nessum and HomePlug AV as baseline technologies. Any IEEE 1901 products can coexist and be fully interoperable between products using the same technology. On the other hand, medium-frequency home control devices remain divided, although X10 tends to be dominant. For power grid use, IEEE has approved a low-frequency (≤ 500 kHz) standard called IEEE 1901.2 in 2013.

===Standards organizations===
Several competing organizations have developed specifications, including the HomePlug Powerline Alliance (defunct), Universal Powerline Association (defunct), and Nessum Alliance (active). In October 2009, the ITU-T adopted Recommendation G.hn/G.9960 as a standard of networks for high-speed powerline, coax, and phoneline communications. The National Energy Marketers Association (a US trade body) was also involved in advocating for standards.

In July 2009, the IEEE Power line Communication Standards Committee approved its draft standard for broadband over power lines. The IEEE 1901 final standard was published on 30 December 2010, and included features from HomePlug and Nessum. Power line communication via IEEE 1901 and IEEE 1905 compliant devices is indicated by the nVoy certification all major vendors of such devices committed to in 2013.  NIST has included IEEE 1901 (Nessum, HomePlug AV) and ITU-T G.hn as &quot;Additional Standards Identified by NIST Subject to Further Review&quot; for the Smart grid in the United States. IEEE also came up with a low-frequency standard for long-distance smart grids called IEEE 1901.2 in 2013.
== Applications ==
PLC technology is widely used in the following systems to empower Smart Building, Smart Factory, Smart Grid, and Smart City, etc., as a solution to reduce network construction costs.

* Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems
* Micro-inverters
* HVAC systems
* Elevators
* Storage batteries
* Smart streetlights
* Lighting control systems
* Intercom systems
* Security camera systems

== Challenges for PLC ==
The primary challenge with the PLC to date is the unshielded and untwisted power wiring. This type of wiring releases significant radio energy, potentially disrupting others using the same frequency band. Additionally, the BPL (Broadband over Power Line) systems may experience interference from the radio signals produced by the PLC wiring.

For home networks relying on powerline communication technology, how to deal with electrical noise injected into the system from standard household appliances remains the largest challenge. Whenever any appliance is turned on or turned off it creates noise that could possibly disrupt data transfer through the wiring. IEEE products that are certified to be HomePlug 1.0 compliant have been engineered to no longer interfere with, or receive interference from other devices plugged into the same home&#x27;s electrical grid.

<doc id="238421" wikidata="Q5431476" url="?curid=238421" title="Fake Songs">
<text>Fake Songs is the third studio album by American musician Liam Lynch, released on April 1, 2003 through S-Curve Records and distributed worldwide by Capitol Records. The album is known for featuring his best-known song &quot;United States of Whatever&quot;, which was released as a single in 2002. The album features a bonus DVD that compiles two-hours of various shorts and skits created by Lynch in his home studio.

An early version of the album, containing an alternative track list with songs unique to that version, was released in 2000 through Lynch&#x27;s 111 Productions imprint.

==Background and recording==
During the first two seasons of Liam Lynch&#x27;s show &quot;The Sifl and Olly Show&quot;, Lynch wrote and recorded comedic tracks, some of which not only appearing on &quot;Fake Songs&quot; but even being featured on the show itself, such as &quot;United States of Whatever&quot;. The track was featured on a sampler album, where fans ripped the song and burned CD-R copies of it. One burned disc eventually got into the hands of the Los Angeles radio station KROQ, in which the track grew in popularity through repeated requests. Lynch would soon give Global Warming Records the right to release the track as a single in the UK in 2002.The sudden popularity of the single resulted in Lynch getting a one-album deal with S-Curve Records.

==Song information==
As the title suggests, some songs on this record are parodies of specific artists. Liam describes these songs as being &quot;musical caricatures&quot;. The tracks &quot;Try Me&quot; and &quot;Cuz You Do&quot; (previously released on Liam&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;We&#x27;re All Nighters&quot;) were re-recorded for this album, featuring Ringo Starr, of The Beatles fame, on drums. The track &quot;Rock and Roll Whore&quot; is a duet song between Lynch and Jack Black of Tenacious D, a band with whom Lynch is friends. Lynch also directed the music video for the band&#x27;s music video for their song &quot;Tribute&quot; as well as their 2006 feature-length film &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;. &quot;Electrician&#x27;s Day&quot; was taken from Lynch&#x27;s 2000 comedy album &quot;History of America?&quot; with Matt Crocco, creator of &quot;The Sifl and Olly Show&quot;

===Other &quot;Fake Songs&quot;===
Four other post-&quot;Fake Songs&quot; parodies by Liam Lynch are known to exist. They are as follows:
* &quot;Fake White Stripes Song&quot; - 2:49
* &quot;Fake Beatles Song&quot; - 1:41
* &quot;Fake Dylan Melody&quot; - 2:13
* &quot;Fake Dylan - Gears of Wear&quot; - 1:13

Both of the fake Bob Dylan songs have been featured on his Podcast, &quot;Lynchland&quot;, along with appearing on the corresponding album, &quot;More Songs From Lynchland&quot;.
&quot;Fake Beatles Song&quot; was never actually meant to be part of the collection of fake songs. Liam had made the song with intent of showing it to Beatles cover band, The Fab Four so that when they played it live, the audience would think it was a never before heard song by The Beatles.

==Marketing==
A music video was produced for the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;United States of Whatever&quot;. Lynch was invited to perform the track on the British TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, however was unable to attend the show, so instead he produced a music video for the show to use instead in a single day. A second single, released as a promo, was made of the track &quot;Still Wasted from the Party Last Night&quot; in 2003. The single was released with little to no airplay and did not initially have a video produced for it. A video was eventually produced years later for Lynch&#x27;s online podcast &quot;Lynchland&quot;.

With the exception of a few live TV show performances, Lynch did not tour to support the album. According to Lynch, S-Curve did offer him a budget to use for touring, however he instead ask them to use the budget to produce short television commercials for the album as well as package the album with the &quot;Fake Movies&quot; bonus DVD.

==Reception==
&quot;Fake Songs&quot; has received mixed reviews. On the review aggregate site Metacritic, the album has a score of 52 out of 100, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews.&quot; Some critics praised the album&#x27;s humor, while others criticized it. MacKenzie Wilson of Allmusic stated that the album &quot;is a hilarious effort loaded with satirical song parodies and rock n&#x27; roll spoofs&quot; and gave the record a 4 out of 5 rating. Ink19 writer Aaron Shaul on the other hand found the humor to be flat and also criticized the use of non-comedic songs (such as &quot;Try Me&quot;) and the &quot;Fake Movies&quot; bonus DVD.

<doc id="238428" wikidata="Q909006" url="?curid=238428" title="Doolittle (album)">
<text>Doolittle is the second studio album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released on April 17, 1989, on 4AD. The album was an instant critical success and became the band&#x27;s breakthrough album. &quot;Doolittle&quot; was especially well received in Europe, where the British music weeklies &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; named it their album of the year. Pixies&#x27; main songwriter and lead vocalist Black Francis wrote the idiosyncratic lyrics, which allude to surrealist imagery, biblical violence, and descriptions of torture and death.

The album is praised for its &quot;quiet/loud&quot; dynamic, which was achieved through subdued verses that are founded on Kim Deal&#x27;s bass patterns and David Lovering&#x27;s drums. The peaks in tone and volume were achieved through the addition of distorted guitars by Francis and Joey Santiago. This technique influenced the development of early-1990s grunge music; Kurt Cobain said &quot;Doolittle&quot; was one of his favorite records and that its songs heavily influenced Nirvana&#x27;s song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.

Upon its release, &quot;Doolittle&quot; reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart. It has sold consistently since its release, and numerous music publications have placed it among the top albums of the 1980s. Both singles from the album, &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;, reached the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks, while many of the album&#x27;s tracks, including &quot;Debaser&quot; and &quot;Hey&quot;, remain favorites of critics and fans.

== Background ==
Pixies&#x27; 1988 album &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; was better received in the United Kingdom than in the United States. In support of its release, the band toured Europe with fellow Bostonian band Throwing Muses, where according to a critic for the UK weekly music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, they were &quot;welcomed like gods, which I felt underestimated them somewhat&quot;. Multiple cover photographs of Pixies were published in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as the album peaked at number one on &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (NME) Indie Chart.

Versions of songs that would later appear on &quot;Doolittle&quot;—including &quot;Dead&quot;, &quot;Hey&quot;, &quot;Tame&quot;, and &quot;There Goes My Gun&quot;—were recorded in the second half of 1988 during several sessions for the BBC Radio One presenter John Peel&#x27;s radio show, and &quot;Hey&quot; appeared on a free Extended Play (EP) that circulated with a 1988 edition of &quot;Sounds&quot;. The first demos for the album were recorded in 1988 in one week at the recording studio Eden Sound in Boston, Massachusetts, during a break from the band&#x27;s touring schedule. The group&#x27;s frontman and main songwriter Black Francis gave the upcoming album the provisional title &quot;Whore&quot;, which he later said was meant &quot;in the more traditional ... operatic ... biblical sense ... as in the great whore of Babylon&quot;.

After completing the demo tape, the band&#x27;s manager Ken Goes suggested two producers: Liverpudlian Gil Norton and American Ed Stasium. The band had worked with Norton on the single version of &quot;Gigantic&quot; in May 1988, and Francis had no preference of producer. Ivo Watts-Russell, head of the band&#x27;s label 4AD, chose Norton to produce their next album. Norton arrived in Boston in mid–October 1988, when he and Francis met to review the demo recordings. They spent two days analyzing the songs&#x27; structures and arrangements, and two weeks in pre-production as Norton familiarized himself with Pixies&#x27; sound.

== Recording and production ==
Recording sessions for &quot;Doolittle&quot; began on October 31, 1988, in Boston at Downtown Recorders, which was then a 24-track studio. 4AD gave Pixies a budget of $40,000 (approximately $ today), excluding producer fees. This was a relatively modest sum for a large, late-1980s independent record label but four times the amount spent on their debut &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. Three weeks of sessions began on November 28 at Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut. Norton worked with two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants. He hired Steven Haigler as mixing engineer, with whom he had earlier worked at Fort Apache Studios.

Francis took a mixture of newly written and older tracks to the recording sessions. Many of the newer tracks were underdeveloped and, according to Norton, were minute or minute-and-a-half &quot;ditties&quot; consisting of short bursts of &quot;verse, chorus, verse, beat-beat-beat-bang ... finished&quot;. Norton said as producer and arranger, he often built tracks by suggesting the band double or repeat sections. Of the approximately 23 songs or ideas the band started with, only three of &quot;Doolittle&quot; final 15 tracks are longer than three minutes.

During the final mixing, Norton smoothed the band&#x27;s rough edges using tight compression, and adding reverb and delay to the guitars, which he then tracked in multiple layers. This is especially notable on the intended lead single &quot;Debaser&quot; and in the double-tracked vocals on &quot;Wave of Mutilation&quot;. During pre-production, Norton advised Francis to slow the tempo and lengthen several songs by adding more verses. &quot;There Goes My Gun&quot; was originally a much-faster and shorter Hüsker Dü-style song; on Norton&#x27;s advice, Francis slowed the tempo while &quot;Debaser&quot; was given an extended coda. Norton&#x27;s suggestions were not always welcome; several instances of advice to add verses frustrated the singer. On one occasion, Francis took Norton to a record store and handed him a copy of a Buddy Holly greatest hits album, in which most of the songs are around two or three minutes long, justifying his desire to keep his songs short. Francis later said he knew Norton was trying to give the band a more-commercial sound while he wanted the band to retain the underground sound they achieved with Albini.

Tension between Francis and the band&#x27;s bassist Kim Deal was noticeable to band members and the production team during the recording. Bickering and standoffs marred the sessions, and led to increased stress among the band members. John Murphy, Deal&#x27;s husband at the time, said the band dynamic &quot;went from just all fun to work&quot; during the production. Production continued until December 12, 1988, while Norton and Haigler mixed the album. During this period, Santiago became unhappy because he felt Norton was adding too much reverb to his guitar parts. In protest, Santiago covered his Marshall guitar amplifiers with blankets to make clear he did not want his sound to be interfered with. The final tapes were sent for mastering later that month.

== Music and lyrics==
Norton&#x27;s production on &quot;Doolittle&quot; is markedly different from Albini&#x27;s recording of &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; and is far more polished than the debut&#x27;s ambient, raw recordings. Albini&#x27;s recording emphasizes Francis&#x27;s abrasive guitars that both popularized the band and sealed his reputation, leading to later work with musicians such as Nirvana and PJ Harvey. Critics continue to debate whether Norton&#x27;s or Albini&#x27;s production best served the Pixies&#x27; music.

Two of the album&#x27;s songs are based on Old Testament stories of sex and death: the story of David and Bathsheba in &quot;Dead&quot;, and the story of Samson and Delilah in &quot;Gouge Away&quot;. Francis&#x27;s fascination with Biblical themes began in his teenage years; when he was twelve, he and his parents joined the Pentecostal church. Biblical imagery is also prevalent in &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;, in which using numerology, Francis describes the Devil as being &quot;six&quot; and God as &quot;seven&quot;.

===Side one===
&quot;Doolittle&quot; opens with &quot;Debaser&quot;, which is described as a &quot;noisy surf-punk&quot; song and widely considered important in Pixies&#x27; crossover to the mainstream. It begins with Deal&#x27;s bass guitar pattern, which breaks into the first chorus when joined by Santiago&#x27;s guitar riff and Black&#x27;s shouted vocal. The track, which is a live favorite, contains an extended coda in which, according to the music critic Rob Hughes, the bassline is overlain with Santiago&#x27;s &quot;frenzied guitar riffage ... at full tilt as the song hurtles to its climax&quot;. Francis&#x27;s lyrics, which he wrote while an anthropology student at University of Massachusetts Amherst, refer to &quot;slicing up eyeballs&quot;, referencing Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí&#x27;s 1929 film &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;. Francis has said he &quot;got into avant-garde movies and Surrealism as an escape from reality ... to me, Surrealism is totally artificial&quot;.

&quot;Tame&quot; is built around Deal&#x27;s three-note bass progression (D, C, F) overlaid by Joey Santiago&#x27;s guitar parts that include an E79 chord, which he described as his &quot;Hendrix chord&quot;—a dominant seventh with an augmented second sharp ninth chord, notable from the 1967 song &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. Tame&#x27;s &quot;loud part&quot; occurs during the chorus, when Francis plays a D/C/F progression and repeatedly screams &quot;tame&quot;. Along with &quot;Gouge Away&quot;, &quot;Tame&quot; is regarded as one of the peaks of Pixies&#x27; signature quiet verse / loud chorus dynamic. According to the music writer Mark Beaumont, &quot;Tame&quot; and &quot;Gouge Away&quot; were among the Pixies&#x27; tracks Kurt Cobain had in mind when writing &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, which Cobain said was his attempt at &quot;writing a Pixies song&quot;. The same influence can be heard in the Nirvana tracks &quot;In Bloom&quot; and &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;. The track ends with Francis and Deal repeatedly grunting, a sound that suggests two people having sex.

The lyrics of &quot;Wave of Mutilation&quot; are based on contemporaneous newspaper reports of Japanese men committing murder–suicide after unsuccessful business ventures in a scene Francis describes as these men being forced to drive &quot;off a pier into the ocean&quot;. Imagery of drowning and oceans also appears in &quot;Mr. Grieves&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;.

&quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; was written when Francis was a teenager; along with &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Chris Mundy described the song as a melodic and &quot;outright pop song&quot;. It was first recorded for the &quot;Purple tapes&quot; sessions, a version the music writer Phil Udell described as rough &quot;around the edges&quot;. Norton arranged the album version.

Side One closes with the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;. The song is written in D major and opens with Francis playing a short chord progression that is backed by Deal&#x27;s bass guitar. The track is over-dubbed with cellos and violins, which made Norton nervous because it took the band &quot;outside [their] usual parameters&quot;, which they had earlier believed &quot;we weren&#x27;t ever going to do on a Pixies song&quot;. &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; describes the effects of human-caused environmental destruction on the ocean. Francis said: &quot;on one hand, it&#x27;s this big organic toilet. Things get flushed and repurified or decomposed and it&#x27;s this big, dark, mysterious place. It&#x27;s also a very mythological place where there are octopus&#x27;s gardens, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and mermaids.&quot;

===Side two===
The second side opens with &quot;Mr. Grieves&quot; played in frantic style that has been described as &quot;faux-hillbilly&quot; and &quot;wired folk&quot;. The lyrics take the idea of destruction further, suggesting the human race is doomed to extinction. The following track &quot;Crackity Jones&quot; is sung partly in Spanish, and incorporates G and A triads over a C pedal. Francis&#x27;s rhythm guitar starts with an eighth-note downstroke that is reminiscent of early 1980s second-wave punk rock. The lyrics of &quot;Crackity Jones&quot; were inspired by Francis&#x27;s one-month stay in Puerto Rico as a student, when he shared a &quot;seedy&quot; high-rise apartment with a &quot;weirdo, psycho, gay roommate&quot;. Musically the track is the fastest-played and most-aggressive track on the album.

The whimsical track &quot;La La Love You&quot; is sung by the band&#x27;s drummer David Lovering in a baritone voice that was intended as a satire of the 1950s crooning style. Francis asked Lovering to sing it in a voice resembling Ringo Starr&#x27;s 1960s tongue-in-cheek vocals. Its vocal style and simplistic lyrics, including the line &quot;first base, second base, third base, home run&quot;, were intended as a parody of crude sex jokes. Because it was his only time providing vocals for a Pixies track, Lovering said on the day of recording, he was so nervous he &quot;[knocked back] a lot of vodka&quot;.

The penultimate song &quot;Silver&quot; was co-written with Deal, who sings the lead vocal line. The track is built around a country music riff that is played on slide guitar; critics described the riff &quot;sparse&quot; and &quot;eerie&quot; in a manner that is reminiscent of soundtracks for late–1960s spaghetti westerns. Critics also consider the track as lacking in melody and dynamics, and it is often considered the weakest song on the album.

The lyrics of the closing song &quot;Gouge Away&quot; are based on the Old Testament story of Samson&#x27;s betrayal by Delilah. Although the music follows the quiet/loud formula, the build-up to the loud part is more gradual and nuanced than in tracks such as &quot;Debaser&quot; and &quot;Tame&quot;. &quot;Gouge Away&quot; is built on Deal&#x27;s three-note bass part (G/B/E) and a tight Lovering drum pattern, which Sisario has described as a &quot;kind of gothic dance groove&quot;. Deal, who also contributed backing vocals, is accompanied in the bridge by Santiago playing B and C notes before ending on G as the chorus begins. The &quot;loud part&quot; occurs in the verses, when both Santiago and Francis follow the bass progression using heavily distorted guitar chords.

==Artwork and title==
Photographer Simon Larbalestier and graphic artist Vaughan Oliver, who had worked on the Pixies&#x27; previous albums &quot;Come on Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;, designed the artwork of &quot;Doolittle&quot;. According to Larbalestier, &quot;Doolittle&quot; was the first album for which he and Oliver had access to lyrics, which &quot;made a fundamental difference&quot;. Oliver and Francis wanted macabre, surreal images with which to illustrate the album. The images are placed in pairs, with each image juxtaposing two principle elements such as a monkey and a halo for &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;; a pelvic bone and a stiletto for &quot;Tame&quot;; and a spoon containing hair laid across a woman&#x27;s torso for &quot;Gouge Away&quot;.

Around the time Oliver decided on the cover art, Francis discarded the album&#x27;s working title &quot;Whore&quot;, worrying &quot;people were going to think I was some kind of anti-Catholic or that I&#x27;d been raised Catholic and trying to get into this Catholic naughty-boy stuff ... A monkey with a halo, calling it &quot;Whore&quot;, that would bring all kinds of shit that wouldn&#x27;t be true. So I said I&#x27;d change the title.&quot;

== Release ==
The American label Elektra Records began to take interest in Pixies around October 1988 and signed the band following a bidding war. The label then negotiated with Pixies&#x27; British label 4AD, which held the band&#x27;s worldwide distribution rights. Elektra released a promotional live album containing the album tracks &quot;Debaser&quot; and &quot;Gouge Away&quot; along with earlier material. In early April, two weeks before &quot;Doolittle&quot; release, Elektra closed a deal with 4AD that allowed them full US distribution rights; PolyGram had already secured Canadian rights.

&quot;Doolittle&quot; was released in the UK on April 17, 1989, and in the US the following day. Elektra&#x27;s major label secured retail displays across the US. The label also exposed the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; to key major and local radio stations. On the week of release, the album reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart, but charted at number 171 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. With the help of college-radio play of &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;, it eventually rose to number 98, spending two weeks in the Top 100. &quot;Doolittle&quot; sold steadily in America, breaking sales of 100,000 after six months. By early 1992, while Pixies were supporting U2 on their Zoo TV Tour, the album was selling 1,500 copies per week. By the middle of 1993, two years after the release of &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;—Pixies&#x27; last album before their first breakup&quot;Doolittle&quot; was selling an average of 1,200 copies per week. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified &quot;Doolittle&quot; gold in 1995 and platinum in 2018.

&quot;Doolittle&quot; success, and especially its heavy rotation on MTV, had a significant effect on the band members. According to Santiago, its sales &quot;validated the career my parents didn’t think I had. When they first saw me on MTV, they went: &#x27;Ah, okay. You’re not just playing shitty nightclubs!&#x27;&quot; According to Francis, shortly after the album&#x27;s release, he was pulled over by the United States Border Patrol near the Mexican border in Texas while in possession of marijuana. One of the officers recognized him from MTV, and minutes later he was posing with them for photographs while holding a shotgun.

==Reception==
Following the critically acclaimed album &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;, &quot;Doolittle&quot; was highly anticipated; it received near-universal positive reviews, especially from the UK and European music press. &quot;NME&quot; Edwin Pouncey wrote: &quot;the songs on &quot;Doolittle&quot; have the power to make you literally jump out of your skin with excitement&quot;. He chose &quot;Debaser&quot; as one of the highlights, describing it as &quot;blessed with the kind of beefy bass hook that originally brought &#x27;Gigantic&#x27; to life&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; critic Peter Kane wrote the album&#x27;s &quot;carefully structured noise and straightforward rhythmic insistence makes perfect sense&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote: &quot;They&#x27;re in love and they don&#x27;t know why—with rock and roll, which is heartening in a time when so many college dropouts have lost touch with the verities.&quot;

&quot;Doolittle&quot; appeared on several contemporaneous end-of-year &quot;Best Album&quot; lists. Both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; placed the album tenth, and music magazines &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named it as their album of the year. &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album fourth in their end-of-year list.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Doolittle&quot; is widely regarded as one of the key alternative rock albums of the 1980s. A 2002 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review gave it the maximum score of five stars, writing it laid the &quot;groundwork for Nineties rock&quot;. &quot;Doolittle&quot; was included in critic Robert Dimery&#x27;s influential book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; included it in their list of the &quot;12 Essential 1980s Alternative Rock Albums&quot; saying, &quot;&quot;Doolittle&quot; captured the musicians at the top of their game&quot;. In a 2017 survey, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it as the fourth-best album of the 1980s; a 2003 poll of &quot;NME&quot; writers ranked &quot;Doolittle&quot; as the second-greatest album of all time; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 141 on its 2020 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Doolittle&quot; established Pixies&#x27; loud/quiet dynamic, which became highly influential on alternative rock. After writing &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, both Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic of Nirvana thought: &quot;this really sounds like the Pixies. People are really going to nail us for this.&quot; Norton was frequently credited with capturing the album&#x27;s dynamics and became highly sought after by bands wishing to achieve a similar sound. The English musician PJ Harvey said she was &quot;in awe&quot; of &quot;I Bleed&quot; and &quot;Tame&quot;, and described Francis&#x27;s writing as &quot;amazing&quot;. British band Slowdive have also noted &quot;Doolittle&quot; as a significant influence on their sound.

Ten years after Pixies&#x27; breakup, &quot;Doolittle&quot; continued to sell between 500 and 1,000 copies a week, and following their 2004 reunion tour, sales reached 1,200 copies per week. At the end of 2005, best estimates put total US sales at between 800,000 and 1,000,000 copies. As of 2015, sales in the United States have exceeded 834,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Pixies released several singles from &quot;Doolittle&quot; after their initial breakup. In 1997, &quot;Debaser&quot; was released to promote the compilation &quot;Death to the Pixies&quot;. In June 1989, 4AD released &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; as the album&#x27;s second single. It reached number three on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 54 in the UK Singles Chart. On May 6, 2019, &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; was certified gold in Canada, and &quot;Hey&quot; was certified gold in Canada on September 20, 2021.

== Track listing ==
All tracks were written by Black Francis, except &quot;Silver&quot;, written by Black Francis and Kim Deal.

To mark the 25th anniversary of &quot;Doolittle&quot;, 4AD released &quot;Doolittle 25&quot;, which includes unreleased B-sides, demos, and two full Peel sessions Pixies recorded for the BBC. On December 9, 2016, a Pure Audio Blu-Ray version of the album, containing a 5.1 surround sound mix by Kevin Vanbergen and a high-definition stereo mix by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, was released. In 2022, &quot;Doolittle&quot; was formatted for Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos and released on Apple Music.

<doc id="238429" wikidata="Q571213" url="?curid=238429" title="Surfer Rosa">
<text>Surfer Rosa is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in March 1988 on the British label 4AD. It was produced by Steve Albini. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; contains many of the elements of Pixies&#x27; earlier output, including Spanish lyrics and references to Puerto Rico. It includes references to mutilation and voyeurism alongside experimental recording techniques and a distinctive drum sound.

As 4AD was an independent label, distribution in the United States was handled by British label Rough Trade Records; however, it failed to chart in either country. Only one single was released, a rerecorded version of &quot;Gigantic&quot;, and reached number 93 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; was rereleased in the US by Elektra Records in 1992, and in 2005 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

&quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; is often included on critics&#x27; lists of the best rock albums. Alternative rock artists including Billy Corgan and PJ Harvey have cited it as an inspiration; it was an influence on Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;In Utero&quot;, which Albini also produced.

==Background==
Before the release of Pixies&#x27; debut mini-album &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; in October 1987, Ivo Watts-Russell, head of 4AD, suggested they return to the studio to record a full-length album. The original plan was to record new material at Fort Apache Studios, where the band had produced &quot;The Purple Tape&quot; and &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;. However, due to differences between the band&#x27;s manager Ken Goes and &quot;The Purple Tape&quot; producer Gary Smith, Pixies ended up looking for a new producer and recording studio. On the advice of a 4AD colleague, Watts-Russell looked to hire Steve Albini as the record&#x27;s engineer and producer. Having sent a pre-release tape of &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; to Albini, Goes invited him to a Boston dinner party at drummer David Lovering&#x27;s house a few weeks after &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;&#x27;s release.

Albini met the band that evening, and they discussed how the next record should sound and be recorded. Albini said that, &quot;[the band and I] were in the studio the next day.&quot; Paul Q. Kolderie, who had worked at Fort Apache Studios with Smith, recommended the Boston recording studio Q Division to Albini. This created tension between Smith and Kolderie, and Kolderie later remarked that &quot;Gary almost killed me for the suggestion, he thought I was scheming to get the project.&quot;

== Recording and production ==
Pixies entered Q Division in December 1987, booking ten working days of studio time in which to record the album. 4AD allocated Pixies a budget of US$10,000, with the total costs amounting to about $18,000. Albini&#x27;s producer&#x27;s fee was US$1,500, and he received no royalties; Albini had a practice of refusing royalties from records he produces, viewing it as &quot;an insult to the band.&quot; Along with Albini in the studio, Q Division&#x27;s Jon Lupfer acted as studio assistant. The recording process took the entire booked period of ten working days to complete, with extra vocal mixes subsequently added in the studio. Albini planned to mix the record &quot;somewhere else&quot;, but according to Lupfer, &quot;He was unhappy there with it.&quot;

=== Albini&#x27;s recording techniques ===
During Kim Deal&#x27;s vocals takes during &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; and &quot;Gigantic&quot;, he moved the equipment to record into a studio bathroom to achieve more &quot;roomy&quot; echo. John Murphy, Deal&#x27;s then husband, said, &quot;Albini didn&#x27;t like the studio sound&quot;. Albini later said that the record could have been completed in a week, but &quot;we ended up trying more experimental stuff basically to kill time and see if anything good materialized.&quot; An example was &quot;Something Against You&quot;, where Albini filtered Black Francis&#x27; voice through a guitar amp for &quot;a totally ragged, vicious texture.&quot;

=== Studio banter ===
The recording of a conversation held between Francis and Albini can be heard at the end of &quot;Oh My Golly!&quot;. Lupfer writes that &quot;it was a concept he [Albini] was going for to get some studio banter.&quot; As Deal was leaving the studio to smoke a cigarette, she exclaimed &quot;If anybody touches my stuff, I&#x27;ll kill ya.&quot; Francis replied with &quot;I&#x27;ll kill you, you fucking die, if anybody touches my stuff&quot;. The track begins at this point, with Francis explaining the conversation to Albini, whose voice is not heard on the track. Lupfer later admitted that Albini knew &quot;perfectly well what was going on.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; begins with Deal recounting a story in which one of her former teachers who was &quot;into field hockey players&quot; was discreetly fired. Francis finishes Deal&#x27;s sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher&#x27;s activities was to try to join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they&#x27;re ok with it, but I honestly don&#x27;t know that that idea would&#x27;ve ever come up if I hadn&#x27;t done it. There are times when things like that are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record.&quot;

== Music ==
Like &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; displays a mix of musical styles; pop guitar songs such as &quot;Broken Face&quot;, &quot;Break My Body&quot;, and &quot;Brick Is Red&quot; are featured alongside slower, more melodic tracks exemplified by &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot;. The album includes heavier material, and prominently features the band&#x27;s trademark quiet-loud dynamic. Frontman and principal songwriter Black Francis wrote the material, the only exception being &quot;Gigantic,&quot; which was co-written with Kim Deal. &quot;Gigantic&quot; is one of only two Pixies album tracks on which Deal sang lead vocals.

&quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;&#x27;s lyrical content includes examinations of mutilation and incest in &quot;Break My Body&quot; and &quot;Broken Face&quot;, while references to superheroes appear on &quot;Tony&#x27;s Theme&quot;. Voyeurism appears in &quot;Gigantic&quot;, and surrealistic lyrics are featured on &quot;Bone Machine&quot; and &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot;. Puerto Rico references and Spanish lyrics are found on the tracks &quot;Oh My Golly!&quot; and &quot;Vamos.&quot; The latter track was previously featured on &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;, and appears on &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; as a rerecorded version of the original song. Many of the themes explored on previous recordings are revisited on &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;; however, unlike on the band&#x27;s later albums, the songs in &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; are not preoccupied with one overarching topic.

Other unusual and offbeat subject matter is raised on the album. &quot;Cactus&quot; is narrated by a prison inmate who requests his girlfriend smear her dress with blood and mail it to him. &quot;Gigantic&quot; is about an illicit love affair and borrows from the 1986 film &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot;, in which a married woman falls in love with a teenager. Francis was inspired to write &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; after scuba diving in the Caribbean. He later said he had &quot;this very small fish trying to chase me. I don&#x27;t know why—I don&#x27;t know too much about fish behavior.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; was released in the UK by 4AD on March 21, 1988, entering the UK Indie Chart the following week. It spent 60 weeks in the chart, peaking at number 2. Until August of that year it was only available in the U.S. as an import. Although the label held worldwide distribution rights to Pixies, they did not have access to a distributor outside the UK. When 4AD signed a distribution deal with Rough Trade&#x27;s U.S. branch, the album was released on vinyl and cassette as part of the &quot;Surfer Rosa/Come On Pilgrim&quot; release. While &quot;Surfer Rosa/Come On Pilgrim&quot; has remained in print on CD in the UK, subsequent U.S. releases have seen the two released on separate CDs. These separate releases first appeared in January 1992, when Elektra Records first reissued the band&#x27;s first two albums. After 4AD reacquired rights to the band&#x27;s U.S. distribution, they released both as separate CDs. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, 17 years after its original release.

&quot;Gigantic&quot; was the only single taken from &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. The track and its B-side, &quot;River Euphrates&quot;, were rerecorded by Gil Norton at Blackwing Studios in London, early in May 1988. The remixed single was well met by critics. The single failed to sell, and spent just one week at number 93 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite the poor commercial performance of both &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; and &quot;Gigantic&quot;, Ivo Watts-Russell has said that the response to the album was &quot;times five&quot; compared with &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;.

== Packaging ==

&quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;″s cover artwork features a photograph of a topless &quot;friend of a friend&quot; of the band, posing as a flamenco dancer, pitched against a wall which displays a crucifix and a torn poster. Simon Larbalestier, who contributed pictures to all Pixies album sleeves, decided to build the set because &quot;we couldn&#x27;t find the atmosphere we wanted naturally.&quot; According to Larbalestier, Black Francis came up with the idea for the cover as he wrote songs in his father&#x27;s &quot;topless Spanish bar&quot;; Larbalestier added the crucifix and torn poster, and they &quot;sort of loaded that with all the Catholicism.&quot; Commenting on the cover in 2005, Francis said, &quot;I just hope people find it tasteful.&quot; The cover booklet expands on the theme, and features photographs of the flamenco dancer in several other poses; there are no song lyrics or written content, apart from album credits, in the booklet.

The booklet&#x27;s photographs were taken in one day at a pub opposite the 4AD offices, because, according to Larbalestier, &quot;it was one of the few places that had a raised stage&quot;. In a 1988 interview with Joy Press, Black Francis described the concept as referring to &quot;a surfer girl,&quot; who &quot;walks along the Beach of Piñones, has a surfboard, very beautiful.&quot; When questioned about the topless element, he replied, &quot;For the first record, I told them I liked nudity. I like body lines—not necessarily something in bad taste, didn&#x27;t even have to be female, just body lines ... like that Obsession ad, you know?&quot; According to &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the album was originally entitled &quot;Gigantic&quot; after Deal&#x27;s song, but the band feared misinterpretation of the cover and changed it to &quot;Surfer Rosa.&quot; The &quot;name&quot; of the cover woman, and the album title, comes from the &quot;Oh My Golly!&quot; lyric &quot;Besando chichando con surfer rosa&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;Kissing, having sex with Surfer Rosa&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
UK music press reviews of &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; were generally positive. &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s Ian Cranna wrote that &quot;what sets the Pixies apart are their sudden bursts of memorable pop melody,&quot; and noted that &quot;they could have a bright future ahead of them.&quot; &quot;NME&quot;″s Mark Sinker, reviewing the album in March 1988, said &quot;they force the past to sound like them&quot;, while Dave Henderson from &quot;Underground&quot; magazine found the songs &quot;well crafted, well delivered sketches which embrace commercial ideals as well as bizarre left-field out of control moments&quot;. John Dougan of American music magazine &quot;Spin&quot; described it as &quot;beautifully brutal&quot;, and the magazine later named Pixies their musicians of the year. In a less enthusiastic contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau found the band&#x27;s guitar riffs recognizable and their strong rhythms unique, but felt they had been overrated by critics who hailed them as &quot;the Amerindie find of the year&quot;. In a 2003 review of the Pixies&#x27; 2002 self-titled EP, Christgau wrote that while he initially found Francis&#x27; fey and philosophically limited lyrics somewhat annoying, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; now seemed &quot;audaciously funny and musically prophetic&quot;.

At the end of 1988, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; was named one of the year&#x27;s best albums on English critics&#x27; year-end lists. Independent music magazines &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; named &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; as their album of the year; &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Record Mirror&quot; placed the album 10th and 14th, respectively. A number of music magazines have since positioned &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; as one of the quintessential alternative rock records of the 1980s. The album has appeared on several all-time best album lists, and is consistently placed as one of the best albums of the 1980s in any genre.

As of 2015, sales in the United States have exceeded 705,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

== Legacy ==
Both &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; and Steve Albini&#x27;s production of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain cited &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; as the basis for &quot;Nevermind&quot;&#x27;s songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he &quot;heard songs off of &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; that I&#x27;d written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.&quot; Cobain listed &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; as one of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana&#x27;s sound in his journal in 1993. Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;In Utero&quot;, primarily due to his contribution to &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. 

The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; Billy Corgan described &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; as &quot;the one that made me go, &#x27;holy shit&#x27;. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.&quot; Corgan was impressed by the album&#x27;s drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Nada Surf have also cited the album as an influence. Musician PJ Harvey said that &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; &quot;blew my mind,&quot; and that she &quot;immediately went to track down Steve Albini.&quot; Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums &quot;Bossanova&quot; and &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;, said he thought that Albini&#x27;s production &quot;sounded way better than the other ones&quot;.

Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: &quot;I remember when I first heard &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; thinking, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.&#x27; That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw.&quot; Gary Smith, who at the time was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he &quot;was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record.&quot; 

In 1991, as Pixies were recording &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;, Albini told the fan magazine &quot;Forced Exposure&quot; that &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; was &quot;a patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock&quot;, and said of the band: &quot;Their willingness to be &#x27;guided&#x27; by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings.&quot; In 2005, Albini apologized for the remarks, saying: &quot;To this day I regret having done it. I don&#x27;t think that I regarded the band as significantly as I should have.&quot; In 2023, he said &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; was &quot;a better record than I thought it was at the time&quot;.

===Accolades===

== Track listing ==
All tracks written by Black Francis, except &quot;Gigantic&quot;, written by Black Francis and Kim Deal.
=== Notes ===
* For the &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;/&quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; release, the eight tracks of &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; appear after &quot;Brick is Red&quot;.
* The untitled eleventh track consists of a quiet recording of conversation in the studio. It exists as a separate track on some CD releases but is not listed on the artwork. As such, after track 10, the track listing numbering on the artwork does not match actual tracks on those CDs.
* The album was re-mastered and released in 2007 as a Hybrid Super Audio CD disc by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab from recently discovered, first-generation analog original master tapes. The studio banter that makes up the untitled track on other releases is on the same track as &quot;Oh My Golly!&quot;.

<text>The great egret(Ardea alba), also known as the common egret, large egret, or (in the Old World) great white egret or great white heron, is a large, widely distributed egret. The four subspecies are found in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and southern Europe. Recently, it has also been spreading to more northern areas of Europe. Distributed across most of the tropical and warmer temperate regions of the world, it builds tree nests in colonies close to water.

==Taxonomy==
The great egret was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Ardea alba&quot;. He specified the type locality as Europe. The scientific name comes from Latin &quot;ardea&quot;, &quot;heron&quot;, and &quot;alba&quot;, &quot;white&quot;.

Like all egrets, it is a member of the heron family, Ardeidae. Traditionally classified with the storks in the Ciconiiformes, the Ardeidae are closer relatives of pelicans and belong in the Pelecaniformes, instead. The great egret—unlike the typical egrets—does not belong to the genus &quot;Egretta&quot;, but together with the great herons is today placed in &quot;Ardea&quot;. In the past, however, it was sometimes placed in &quot;Egretta&quot; or separated in a monotypic genus &quot;Casmerodius&quot;.

The Old World population is often referred to as the &quot;great white egret&quot;. This species is sometimes confused with the great white heron of the Caribbean, which is a white morph of the closely related great blue heron.

===Subspecies===
Four subspecies are found in various parts of the world, which differ but little. Differences among them include bare-part coloration in the breeding season and size. The smallest subspecies, &quot;A. a. modesta&quot;, is from Asia and Australasia and some taxonomists consider it to be a full species, the eastern great egret (&quot;Ardea modesta&quot;), but most scientists treat it as a subspecies.

* &quot;A. a. alba&quot; – nominate, found in Europe and across the Palearctic.
* &quot;A. a. egretta&quot; – found in the Americas
* &quot;A. a. melanorhynchos&quot; – found in Africa
* &quot;A. a. modesta&quot; – eastern great egret, found in India, Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania

==Description==

The great egret is a large heron with all-white plumage. Standing up to tall, this species can measure in length with a wingspan of . Body mass can range from , with an average around . It is thus only slightly smaller than the great blue or grey heron (&quot;A. cinerea&quot;). Apart from size, the great egret can be distinguished from other white egrets by its yellow bill and black legs and feet, though the bill may become darker and the lower legs lighter in the breeding season. In breeding plumage, delicate ornamental feathers are borne on the back. Males and females are identical in appearance; juveniles look like nonbreeding adults. Differentiated from the intermediate egret (&quot;Ardea intermedia&quot;) by the gape, which extends well beyond the back of the eye in case of the great egret, but ends just behind the eye in case of the intermediate egret.

Its flight is slow with its neck retracted. This is characteristic of herons and bitterns, and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, ibises, and spoonbills, which extend their necks in flight. The great egret walks with its neck extended and wings held close. The great egret is not normally a vocal bird; it gives a low, hoarse croak when disturbed, and at breeding colonies, it often gives a loud croaking &quot;cuk cuk cuk&quot; and higher-pitched squawks.
Owing to its wide distribution across so much of the Americas, as well as Africa, Europe and Asia, the great egret shares its habitat with many other similar species. For example, the little egret (&quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;), intermediate egret (&quot;Ardea intermedia&quot;), Chinese egret (&quot;Egretta eulophotes&quot;), and the western reef heron (&quot;Egretta gularis&quot;). In the Americas, the snowy egret (&quot;Egretta thula&quot;)—a medium-sized heron that shares the same habitat as the great egret—is one such species. The snowy egret is readily distinguished from the great egret because it is noticeably smaller, and it has a more slender bill which is black in color and yellow feet, whereas the great egret has a yellow bill and black feet. Another species that—in North America—is easily confused with the great egret is the white morph of the great blue heron (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;). The great blue heron is a bit larger, and has a thicker bill than that of the great egret.

==Distribution and habitat==
The great egret is generally a very successful species with a large and expanding range, occurring worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. It is ubiquitous across the Sun Belt of the United States and in the Neotropics.

===Conservation===
In North America, large numbers of great egrets were killed around the end of the 19th century so that their plumes, known as &quot;aigrettes&quot;, could be used to decorate hats. Numbers have since recovered as a result of conservation measures. Its range has expanded as far north as southern Canada. However, in some parts of the southern United States, its numbers have declined due to habitat loss, particularly wetland degradation through drainage, grazing, clearing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants. Nevertheless, the species adapts well to human habitation and can be readily seen near wetlands and bodies of water in urban and suburban areas.

The great egret is partially migratory, with northern hemisphere birds moving south from areas with colder winters. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

On 22 May 2012, a pair of great egrets was observed nesting in the UK for the first time at the Shapwick Heath nature reserve in Somerset. The species was a rare visitor to the UK and Ben Aviss of the BBC stated that the news could mean the UK&#x27;s first great egret colony had become established. The following week, Kevin Anderson of Natural England confirmed a great egret chick had hatched, making it a new breeding bird record for the UK. In 2017, seven nests in Somerset fledged 17 young, and a second breeding site was announced at Holkham National Nature Reserve in Norfolk where a pair fledged three young. In January 2021, BirdGuides, a UK website and magazine which reports sightings of rare birds, dropped the species from its list of nationally rare birds because sightings had become so numerous. In August 2024, RSPB Scotland announced that a pair had raised three chicks at their Loch of Strathbeg nature reserve in North Aberdeenshire, the first chicks to hatch in Scotland.

A similar move northwards has been observed in the Nordic countries where historically it was only a rare visitor. The first confirmed breeding in Sweden was 2012 and in Denmark was 2014. Both countries now have small colonies. In 2018, a pair of great egrets nested in Finland for the first time, raising four young in a grey heron colony in Porvoo.

==Ecology==
The species breeds in colonies in trees close to large lakes with reed beds or other extensive wetlands, preferably at height of . It begins to breed at 2–3 years of age by forming monogamous pairs each season. Whether the pairing carries over to the next season is not known. The male selects the nest area, starts a nest, and then attracts a female. The nest, made of sticks and lined with plant material, could be up to 3 feet across. Up to six bluish green eggs are laid at one time. Both sexes incubate the eggs, and the incubation period is 23–26 days. The young are fed by regurgitation by both parents and are able to fly within 6–7 weeks.

===Diet===

The great egret forages in shallow water or in drier habitats, feeding mainly on fish, frogs, other amphibians, small mammals (such as mice), and occasionally small reptiles (such as snakes), crustaceans (such as crayfish) and insects (such as crickets and grasshoppers). This species normally impales its prey with its long, sharp bill by standing still and allowing the prey to come within the striking distance of its bill, which it uses as a spear. It often waits motionless for prey or slowly stalks its victim.

===Parasites===
A long-running field study (1962–2013) suggested that the great egrets of central Europe host 17 different helminth species. Juvenile great egrets were shown to host fewer species, but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adults. Of the digeneans found in central European great egrets, numerous species likely infected their definitive hosts outside of central Europe itself.

==In culture==
The great egret is depicted on the reverse side of a 5-Brazilian reais banknote.

The great egret is the symbol of the National Audubon Society.

An airbrushed photograph of a great egret in breeding plumage by Werner Krutein is featured in the cover art of the 1992 Faith No More album &quot;Angel Dust&quot;.

In Belarus, a commemorative coin has the image of a great egret. The great egret also features on the New Zealand $2 coin and on the Hungarian 5-forint coin.

<text>Celebrity Skin is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Hole, released on September 8, 1998, in the United States on DGC Records and internationally on Geffen Records. It was the last album released by the band before their dissolution in 2002. Hole intended for the record to diverge significantly from their previous noise and grunge-influenced sound as featured on &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; (1991) and &quot;Live Through This&quot; (1994). The band hired producer Michael Beinhorn to record &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; over a nine-month period that included sessions in Los Angeles, New York City, and London. It was the band&#x27;s only studio release to feature bassist Melissa Auf der Maur. Drummer Patty Schemel played on the demos for the album but was replaced by session drummer Deen Castronovo at the suggestion of Beinhorn. This issue created a rift between Schemel and the band, resulting in her dropping out of the tour and parting ways with the group, though she was still credited.

The band sought to use Los Angeles and the state of California as a unifying theme and began writing what they conceived as a &quot;California album&quot; in 1997. Unlike Hole&#x27;s previous releases, the final songs on &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; featured instrumental contributions from several musicians outside the band, primarily Billy Corgan, who co-wrote the musical arrangements on five songs. Auf der Maur&#x27;s former bandmate Jordon Zadorozny, as well as Go-Go&#x27;s guitarist Charlotte Caffey, also contributed to the composition of one track. Frontwoman Courtney Love, who wrote all of the lyrics, named the album and its title track after a poem she had written that was influenced by T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. Motifs of water and drowning are also prominent throughout the album.

&quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; is Hole&#x27;s most commercially successful album. It peaked at number nine on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, number four on the Australian Albums Chart, and number 11 on the UK Albums Chart. To date, it has sold over 1.4 million copies in the United States alone, has been certified as double-platinum in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and platinum in Canada by Music Canada (MC) and the United States by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It garnered Hole a number-one hit single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart with the title track, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;. Critical reaction to the album was very positive and it was listed on a number of publications&#x27; year-end lists in 1998, including those by &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. The album was named the 265th greatest album of all time by a 2013 poll by &quot;NME&quot; magazine and was featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Production and composition==
===Recording history===
In September 1995, Hole completed the final leg of their year-long tour in promotion for their second studio album, &quot;Live Through This&quot; (1994). During the hiatus that followed, the members of Hole began working on individual projects. Frontwoman Courtney Love was cast as Althea Flynt in &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; (1996) alongside Woody Harrelson, lead guitarist Eric Erlandson collaborated with Rodney Bingenheimer and Thurston Moore on the short-lived project Rodney &amp; the Tube Tops from 1996 to 1997, bassist Melissa Auf der Maur provided backing on Ric Ocasek&#x27;s album &quot;Troublizing&quot; (1997), and drummer Patty Schemel played with the Lemonheads on the tribute album &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks&quot; (1996).

After Love completed her obligations promoting &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, the band reunited to write new material for their next album, titled &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;. According to Love, the embryonic versions of the songs &quot;weren&#x27;t very good&quot; and &quot;not written well&quot;. However, the songs developed following the band&#x27;s relocation to several parts of the United States, including Nashville, Memphis, and New Orleans. During their time in New Orleans, the band recorded a number of demos, including an early version of &quot;Awful&quot; (1999) and songs which later developed into &quot;Dying&quot; and &quot;Hit So Hard&quot;. During these writing and recording attempts, Love had grown frustrated as she felt the songs were not coalescing into a unifying whole. Erlandson later said he felt that &quot;everything was falling apart...  Making that record was insane. There were obstacles at each step of the way.&quot; Because of this perceived lack of direction, Love decided to use California as a theme to build the songs around: &quot;Let&#x27;s tie this together with a concept, even if it&#x27;s fake,&quot; she recalled, &quot;for directional purposes.&quot; Specifically, Love sought to interpret California as &quot;a metaphor for the American dream&quot;.
The band entered Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles in April 1997 to begin the recording sessions of the album. The original plan was to have Billy Corgan as executive producer, who was a second choice after Brian Eno, however, Corgan did not initially participate in, or contribute to the recording process. Michael Beinhorn was hired as head of production instead. Recording sessions for the album were spread out over the course of eight to nine months in various locations. The majority of the album was recorded at Conway Recording Studios, however, additional recording was done at Record Plant West in Los Angeles and Olympic Studios in London, United Kingdom. The final recording sessions were completed at Quad Studios in early 1998. These sessions were also video-taped by a friend of the band, as noted in an October 1998 article in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. Auf der Maur characterized the sessions as being based around Love&#x27;s busy schedule at the time: &quot;It was her Hollywood phase&quot;, during which she would &quot;chain-smoke Marlboro lights&quot;, &quot;go to the beach at 7AM with a personal trainer and auditioning. She&#x27;d just done &quot;[The People vs.] Larry Flynt&quot;.&quot;

According to Love, her vision for the album was to &quot;deconstruct the California Sound&quot; in the L.A. tradition of bands like The Doors, The Beach Boys and The Byrds, but she was struggling with the composition of the record and felt like she was &quot;in a rut&quot;. After sending early recordings of the songs to Corgan, he decided to join the band in the studio for a total of twelve days in an attempt to help Love with her songcraft. Love compared Corgan&#x27;s presence in the studio to &quot;a math teacher who wouldn&#x27;t give you the answers but was making you solve the problems yourself&quot;, and stated that he had her study key changes as well as melodies and phrasing from songs by Frank Sinatra and The Beatles:

Of the album&#x27;s twelve tracks, Corgan shares instrumental songwriting credits on five. In addition to Corgan, Auf der Maur&#x27;s former Tinker bandmate, Jordon Zadorozny, and Go-Go&#x27;s guitarist and songwriter Charlotte Caffey helped co-compose the track &quot;Reasons to Be Beautiful&quot;.

A wide variety of guitars, effect pedals and equipment were used during the recording of &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;. Love used Fender tube amplifiers, Matchless amps, Ampeg amps and a Randall Commander that belonged to Love&#x27;s late husband Kurt Cobain. Love&#x27;s primary guitars during the sessions were her custom Fender Vista Venus and a Chet Atkins Gretsch. Erlandson&#x27;s guitar set-up was much more complex, using numerous guitars through different effects in a set-up he arranged with Beinhorn. He used three of his Veleno guitars that were also used to record &quot;Live Through This&quot;, a 1968 Fender Telecaster and &quot;numerous other guitars&quot;. Each signal from each guitar was split to two separate channels. One channel included a Tech 21 SansAmp, a collection of vintage analog synthesizers, including a Serge modular system, an ARP 2600 and a Moog modular system with a Bode frequency shifter. The other side included a Watkins Dominator, which &quot;provided tons of low end&quot;, and generators that were later used during the production process. Recording was officially completed in London in late February 1998.

====Drum tracks====
Despite receiving credit on the album, Patty Schemel only recorded drum tracks for its demos, and was replaced by session drummer Deen Castronovo during the final recording sessions; thus, her drumming does not appear on the finished tracks. According to Schemel, Beinhorn was actively &quot;psyching her out&quot; in the studio when she began recording. According to sound technician Chris Whitemeyer, Beinhorn would request endless takes of Schemel&#x27;s drumming, only to then lower the volume in his booth to inaudible levels, sit back, and read a newspaper. Whitemeyer also stated that Schemel was forced to drum in the studio eight hours a day for over two weeks, and that Beinhorn &quot;wanted Patty to give up&quot;. Schemel later likened the recording sessions to &quot;athletic training&quot;. After Schemel completed over two weeks of recording, Beinhorn brought Love into the studio and had her listen to recorded loops of Schemel&#x27;s &quot;weakest playing&quot;, and then suggested Castronovo as an alternative. Beinhorn also claimed to Love that Schemel would get &quot;red-light fever&quot; in the studio, implying that she was incapable of remembering the correct parts to play during recording. Whitemeyer claimed that Castronovo had been asked by Beinhorn to play on the record before Love or any of the other band members heard Schemel&#x27;s drum tracks, and that Beinhorn &quot;had it all planned out&quot; early on.

Beinhorn&#x27;s pressure, coupled with a feeling that Love wasn&#x27;t supporting her, resulted in Schemel leaving the studio, requesting a settlement, and breaking ties with the band. Several months later, Schemel showed up to join the band for promotional photoshoots as per her original contract with the label, but refused to tour with the band to support the record. In 2002, Love admitted in an interview with Carrie Fisher that despite Beinhorn&#x27;s meddling, it had ultimately been her decision to have Schemel replaced on the album:
===Music and arrangements===
&quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; marked a major shift in Hole&#x27;s musical style, emphasizing a more mainstream alternative rock sound. Jael Goldfine of &quot;Paper&quot; magazine notes that the album &quot;defined the post-grunge power pop sound of the &#x27;90s.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s James Hunter observed that the album features shifts in guitar sounds that alternate from &quot;silveriness to something rougher in a heartbeat,&quot; adding that it is teeming with &quot;minimalist explosion, idiomatic flair and dead-on rhythms.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; later referred to the album as having ushered in a pop rock &quot;era&quot; for Hole.

In 2018, Melissa Auf der Maur reflected &quot;That wasn&#x27;t something I was striving for but it was something Courtney and the label were. At the time I was like, &#x27;why are you making this so fancy?&#x27; but she had a whole vision for her art.&quot; Rebecca Nicholson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed a darker subtext to the album&#x27;s glossy production, however, noting: &quot;&quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;″s aesthetic is caught up in that turmoil of competing identities, a push-pull of glossy glamour and its seedy underbelly. For all the slickness of Michael Beinhorn’s production and the big-budget videos that accompanied its singles, the songs remain raw and cynical, as wary and worn as they are defiant.&quot;

==Lyrics and themes==

While writing the lyrics for &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, Love aimed to &quot;marry great hooks with a dense [lyrical] vision...  I want to be as perverse as I&#x27;d like to be—while making you hum along with it.&quot; She cited an array of literary influences, including T. S. Eliot. Several songs on the album reference, and sometimes directly quote, multiple literary works: The album&#x27;s title track directly quotes &quot;The House of Life&quot; by Dante Rossetti (&quot;my name is might-have-been&quot;), as well as William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (&quot;So glad I came here with your pound of flesh&quot;). &quot;Awful&quot;, the album&#x27;s third single, references Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Cherry, Cherry&quot;, as well as the American spiritual &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;.

Various lyrical references to Hollywood and California culture are present throughout the album. Whereas the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;, had dealt with the &quot;repulsive aspects of L.A.superficiality, sexism, violence, and drugs&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; examined the more opulent elements of Los Angelesspecifically from the perspective of Love, who at the time had risen as an A-list star but &quot;deconstructed the concept, picking off the healing scab of her public reinvention to rehash the wounds of her past&quot;. Commenting on the themes, James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; notes that the album is lyrically obsessed with &quot;the promises and the agonies of Southern California. Sold-out sluts, fading actresses, deluded teenagers, “summer babes” and hunks—all this “beautiful garbage” crowds the roadside of the album.&quot; Gil Kaufman, writing about the album for MTV, noted that &quot;Love&#x27;s crash-and-burn lyrics are full of provocative, self-referential phrases that might harbor double or triple meanings.&quot;

Another prominent lyrical and aesthetic theme on the record is water and drowning, as noted by Erlandson in a 1998 interview on the album&#x27;s composition and recording sessions. Erlandson cited the drowning death of Jeff Buckley, as well as the deaths of both Erlandson&#x27;s and Auf der Maur&#x27;s fathers of pulmonary edema and lung cancer, respectively. &quot;Those were literal things,&quot; said Erlandson, &quot;but drowning became a metaphor for this record and for all the people we had lost.&quot; Additional lyrical motifs include angels, stars, and heaven. Commenting on the recurring images throughout the album, Love said: &quot;I&#x27;m a Cancer. I recycle.&quot;

On the album&#x27;s title, Love divulged that she initially wanted to name it &quot;Holy War&quot;, as she felt it was &quot;a mission statement. It&#x27;s a statement of such pretense and import. It&#x27;s incredibly ambitious.&quot; Erlandson alternately wanted to name the record &quot;Sugar Coma&quot;, which Love opposed, stating it was &quot;pedestrian—it denotes the end of a cycle. Something deadly. If executives like it, you know it&#x27;s bad.&quot; The final title, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, was teased by Love during a 1995 interview with Jools Holland, in which she joked that she was considering naming their upcoming album &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; because she had &quot;touched a lot of it&quot;. She subsequently clarified that she had derived the name from a short-lived band in Los Angeles named Celebrity Skin, as well as a bootleg pornographic magazine featuring nude candid photos of celebrities.

==Release==
&quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; was released internationally on September 8, 1998. It was the last album released by Hole before their dissolution in 2002, though frontwoman Courtney Love later revived the band with new members for the release of &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 2010.

===Singles===
Despite the extreme measures undertaken by Hole&#x27;s label, DGC Records, to prevent the album from leaking (including an &quot;iron clad&quot; agreement that prohibited music journalists who received advance copies from allowing anyone else to hear or record the album), the first single from the album, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, was leaked three weeks before its intended release dates and played &quot;nearly a dozen times&quot; on New York radio station WXRK (92.3 FM) and their Los Angeles-based sister station, KROQ-FM (106.7 FM), on the weekend of July 31 to August 2, 1998. DGC spokesperson Jim Merlis denied that the leak originated from them and issued WXRK a cease and desist order on August 3, 1998. Nevertheless, San Francisco radio station Live 105 (105.3 FM) played the single again the following weekend.

The lead single, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, was officially released on September 8, 1998, the same day of the album release. It peaked at number 85 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and entered the top 20 of the United Kingdom, Scotland, and Iceland. It also topped the US Alternative Songs chart and the Canadian Rock/Alternative chart. The single was nominated for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1999 Grammy Awards. It was followed by &quot;Malibu&quot;, released on December 29, 1998. The single peaked at number 81 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and entered the top 40 of Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Malibu&quot; was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards and nominated for a Music Video Cinematography Achievement provided by the Music Video Production Association. The single also received a nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group at the 2000 Grammy Awards. The third and final single, &quot;Awful&quot;, was released on April 27, 1999. It peaked at number 13 on US Alternative Songs chart and entered the ARIA Top 100 Singles Chart and the UK Singles Chart.

===Artwork===

The front cover of the album features a black-and-white photograph of all four band members standing in front of a burning palm tree. The photograph was a Polaroid that had initially been intended as a test shot, but was ultimately chosen for the cover art. Joe-Mama Nitzberg, the album&#x27;s art director, recalled that the palm tree and fire were in fact real, and that at one point during the shoot, a wind gust led the tree to topple over. Nitzberg stated that the unifying visual theme for the album&#x27;s overall artwork and packaging was to highlight Los Angeles as an artificial &quot;paradise.&quot;

The lyrical themes of water and drowning were carried over to the album&#x27;s packaging, with the back cover displaying a cropped version of the painting &quot;Ophelia Drowning&quot; (1895) by Paul Steck. Photographs of the Modesto Arch (which reads &quot;Water, Wealth, Contentment, Health&quot;) and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power figure in the liner notes, keeping in theme with the album&#x27;s preoccupation with California. The liner notes dedicate the album to &quot;the stolen water of Los Angeles and to anyone who ever drowned&quot;, the former referring to the California water wars.

==Reception==
&quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said Love is &quot;better punk than actress, better actress than popster&quot; and listed the title track and &quot;Awful&quot; as the album&#x27;s most notable songs. Robert Cherry of the &quot;Alternative Press&quot; described &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;″s sound as &quot;meticulously orchestrated guitars, multilayered vocal harmonies, quantized drums and sheeny studio magic&quot; and said the songs &quot;hit nerve centers like a thousand AM classics&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Marc Savlov referred to the album as &quot;end of the summer crunch-pop from the most enigmatic woman around&quot; but criticized Love&#x27;s &quot;painful, quasi-Freudian vein&quot; and &quot;Michael Beinhorn&#x27;s slick, SoCal production&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer Robert Hilburn called the album &quot;one wild emotional ride&quot; and &quot;a far more complex work than the invigorating, mainstream coating would lead you to believe.&quot; Steve Sutherland of &quot;NME&quot; mentioned that &quot;the first thing you think when &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; smacks you in the nose is that you may never need to hear a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll record ever again,&quot; and compared the album&#x27;s sound to Fleetwood Mac.

James Hunter from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;sprung, flung and fun, high-impact, rock-fueled pop&quot; and noted that &quot;it teems with sonic knockouts that make you see all sorts of stars and is accessible, fiery and intimate – often at the same time,&quot; while &quot;Spin&quot; reviewer Joshua Clover referred to the album as &quot;a record filled with quotation and reference, backtalk and revision&quot; and said &quot;there are too many great songs, and this is a magnificent pop record.&quot; A review published in &quot;Musician&quot; also praised the album, particularly Erlandson&#x27;s guitar contributions, noting: &quot;Erlandson&#x27;s tireless, monomaniacal guitar wizardry gives &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; its gorgeous textures and resonant power.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer David Browne said &quot;the music is sleeker and more taut than anything Hole have done&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Caroline Sullivan awarded the album three out of five stars, writing that &quot;Love and Hole have always been about feeling rather than technique...  well, a bit of technique actually creeps in, too. Technique is the only word for whatever process made certain segments of &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; sound so confident, so smooth.&quot;

Of retrospective assessments, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the album was &quot;a glaze of shiny guitars and hazy melodies, all intended to evoke the heyday of Californian pop in the late &#x27;70s,&quot; awarding the album three and a half stars out of five. In a piece celebrating the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, &quot;Stereogum&quot; critic Gabriela Claymore characterized it as a &quot;polished, decadent rock [record] with something rotten at its core... Hole&#x27;s most sonically accomplished album but it is not their best.&quot; Tom Edwards of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; was more critical in a retrospective review, referring to &quot;Awful&quot; as &quot;gorgeous, pure blues&quot; and &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; as &quot;the best song about love since &#x27;Retard Girl&#x27;,&quot; but concluding that &quot;it&#x27;s a weak record full of empty music either way.&quot;

===Accolades===
Several publications included &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; in their year-end periodical lists, including &quot;Time&quot;, who listed the album at number nine on its Best of 1998 Music list, &quot;Spin&quot;, who listed the album at number 11 on its Top 20 Albums of the Year list, and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, who listed the album at number 14 in the Pazz and Jop Critics&#x27; Poll. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Robert Hillburn ranked it number five on the list of Top 10 Albums of the Year. The 2013 &quot;NME&quot;″s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time ranked &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; 265th on their list.

<text>William Patrick Niederst (born September 5, 1970), better known as Liam Lynch, is an American filmmaker, singer, musician, songwriter, and puppeteer.

While studying at LIPA in Liverpool, United Kingdom, Lynch co-created, co-wrote, directed, scored, and produced the 1998 MTV comedy puppet series &quot;The Sifl and Olly Show&quot;. His 2003 album &quot;Fake Songs&quot; featured the song &quot;United States of Whatever&quot;, which peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia and the United Kingdom. He has since become more known for directing music videos for acts such as Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters, Royal Blood, Tenacious D, Spinnerette, No Doubt, Eagles of Death Metal, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, and They Might Be Giants.

Lynch directed the 2006 film &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot; after working with Tenacious D in 2002, having directed the music video for their song &quot;Tribute&quot;. He also directed several short films that played as part of their live show, as well as the documentary &quot;On The Road with Tenacious D&quot;. He also wrote the original music used in the 2002 MTV animated series &quot;Clone High&quot; and co-wrote a song in the 2003 film &quot;School of Rock,&quot; as well as directing Sarah Silverman&#x27;s 2005 stand-up comedy film &quot;Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic&quot;.

==Early life==
Lynch was born William Patrick Niederst in Petersburg, Virginia, on September 5, 1970. Before pursuing a career in the arts, he worked various jobs such as a restaurant dishwasher, a Blockbuster employee, a car washer, a box factory worker, a telemarketer, and a wax museum tour guide. He also tested artificial intelligence for Sony when they introduced their now-defunct AIBO robot dogs, and still owns the early prototype of the robot.

==Career==
When Lynch was 23, his friend read a story in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Paul McCartney was going to open a unique performing arts school in Liverpool called the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA) and gave Lynch information on how to apply. He was one of 40 musicians chosen to join LIPA from around the world. During his time in the United Kingdom, Lynch created the concept of what was to become &quot;The Sifl and Olly Show&quot;. He wanted to make something using the recordings he and Matt Crocco made a few years prior as a Christmas present for Crocco. He originally wanted to do stop motion photography, but didn&#x27;t have the money or the equipment for it. When he made the first episode, it was 3 a.m. and he grabbed the only materials he had nearby, which were socks; he later said that &quot;it could have easily been buckets&quot;. Making puppets out of his socks and borrowing a video camera from a friend, he created &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot;. He sent a few tapes to MTV Europe in 1996, leading them to become idents played in between music videos. A year later, the idents would become half-hour shows. In 1997, to work on &quot;The Sifl and Olly Show&quot; pilot, Lynch relocated back to the U.S. from Liverpool and settled in Nashville, Tennessee, though he briefly returned to Liverpool to finish his studies.

MTV began airing &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot; in the U.S. in July 1998, but the show only lasted two seasons. A third season was released as a DVD available through the &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot; website. Lynch&#x27;s song &quot;United States of Whatever&quot; was featured during the first season of &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot;. When the show was canceled, he put the song on a sampler CD. It was used in a commercial for the 2003 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;, with Tony Hawk having made a guest appearance on the third season of &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot;. The song was later featured on Lynch&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Fake Songs&quot;, produced by his own company 111 Productions, which led to the song peaking within the top ten of the charts in Australia and the United Kingdom. The song later gained a Guinness World Record for being the shortest song to peak within the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, clocking in at just 1 minute and 25 seconds. When he was asked to perform the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, Lynch was on tour with No Doubt to film them for a live DVD. Since he could not make the show, he promised to send a performance video in his place; the video, hastily shot and edited in one day, become the song&#x27;s official music video.

While working on &quot;Fake Songs&quot;, Lynch directed a UK-only music video for the Foo Fighters song &quot;Times Like These&quot;; worked on DVDs for No Doubt, Tenacious D, and Eagles of Death Metal, Sarah Silverman, and Queens of the Stone Age; and finished composing music for the MTV animated series &quot;Clone High&quot;. He also co-wrote music for the Jack Black film &quot;School of Rock&quot;. He released several of his albums, including &quot;We&#x27;re All-Nighters&quot; and &quot;How to Be a Satellite&quot;, in 2006. He released his album &quot;Get Up on the Raft&quot; in 2008. He also released two volumes of songs from his podcast &quot;Lynchland&quot;. He collaborated on and directed Sarah Silverman&#x27;s film &quot;Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic&quot;, also co-writing and producing the soundtrack. He then directed &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;, released in late 2006, and helped to write and played guitar for the album of the same name. In 2007, he animated and voiced the character of Bulby, a wise-cracking light bulb created to promote the Queens of the Stone Age album &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;.

In 2009, Lynch directed the music video for the song &quot;Craigslist&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic from his album &quot;Alpocalypse&quot;. Later that year, he was credited for the graphics and artwork on Them Crooked Vultures&#x27; debut self-titled album. In 2012, he directed several music videos for songs from Tenacious D&#x27;s &quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot; album. He also made the artwork for the band&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Jazz&quot; EP. In 2013, he directed the music video for They Might Be Giants&#x27; title track from the album &quot;Nanobots&quot;. In 2014, he directed the music video for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;First World Problems&quot; from his album &quot;Mandatory Fun&quot;. In 2018, he directed the music video for Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s song &quot;Head Like a Haunted House&quot; from their album &quot;Villains&quot;. In 2021, he directed and starred in the music videos for Royal Blood&#x27;s songs &quot;Boilermaker&quot; and &quot;Oblivion&quot; from their album &quot;Typhoons&quot;. In 2024, Lynch animated a section of the music video for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s single, &quot;Polkamania.&quot;

Pictures of Lynch were used as inspiration in designing one of the aliens in J. J. Abrams&#x27; 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film. Lynch has a podcast, &quot;LynchLand&quot;, which features video animations, songs from his albums, and guests. He also features his cats and other animals around his home. His video podcast has over 90,000 viewers. He sells merchandise on his website to offset the costs of making the podcast. The podcast has featured appearances by Ringo Starr, Josh Homme, Sarah Silverman, Jack Black, Tony Hawk, Tim Robbins, Shirley Manson, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Dhani Harrison, and Alex Albrecht.

==Personal life==
Lynch married his wife, artist Robin McCauley, on an unknown date in the wheel house of the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach, California. He claims to have lived in a haunted building during his time in the United Kingdom, which gave him an interest in the paranormal. He and his wife have collected many audio recordings and videos of their paranormal experiences, some of which they have uploaded onto a YouTube channel called The Spark Club. In 2006, he had his pet cat cloned, making it the sixth cat ever to be cloned; the company who performed the cloning was later absorbed into ViaGen Pets.

Lynch has dyslexia, two types of color blindness, and insomnia. He is unable to burp. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs of any kind. He is an avid gamer and can be seen in a bonus video on the original disc of the video game &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, in which he explains the equipment he uses by Line 6, the company who developed the guitar tones for the game to match the various musicians they needed to mimic. He is a lifelong &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan, and continues to watch the series and collect memorabilia.

<text>Lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis ), sometimes written lily-of-the-valley, is a woodland flowering plant with sweetly scented, pendent, bell-shaped white flowers borne in sprays in spring. It is native throughout the cool temperate Northern Hemisphere in Asia and Europe. &quot;Convallaria majalis&quot; var. &quot;montana&quot;, also known as the American lily of the valley, is native to North America.

Due to the concentration of cardiac glycosides (cardenolides), it is highly poisonous if consumed by humans or other animals.

Other names include May bells, Our Lady&#x27;s tears, and Mary&#x27;s tears. Its French name, muguet, sometimes appears in the names of perfumes imitating the flower&#x27;s scent. In pre-modern England, the plant was known as glovewort (as it was a wort used to create a salve for sore hands), or Apollinaris (according to a legend that it was discovered by Apollo).

==Description==

&quot;Convallaria majalis&quot; is a herbaceous perennial plant that often forms extensive colonies by spreading underground stems called rhizomes. New upright shoots are formed at the ends of stolons in summer, these upright dormant stems are often called pips. These grow in the spring into new leafy shoots that still remain connected to the other shoots under ground. The stems grow to tall, with one or two leaves long; flowering stems have two leaves and a raceme of five to fifteen flowers on the stem apex.

The flowers have six white tepals (rarely pink), fused at the base to form a bell shape, diameter, and sweetly scented; flowering is in late spring, in mild winters in the Northern Hemisphere it is in early March. The fruit is a small orange-red berry diameter that contains a few large whitish to brownish colored seeds that dry to a clear translucent round bead wide. Plants are self-incompatible, and colonies consisting of a single clone do not set seed.

==Taxonomy==
In the APG III system, the genus is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). It was formerly placed in its own family Convallariaceae, and, like many lilioid monocots, before that in the lily family Liliaceae.

There are three varieties that have sometimes been separated out as distinct species or subspecies by some botanists.
* &quot;Convallaria majalis&quot; var. &quot;keiskei&quot; – from China and Japan, with red fruit and bowl-shaped flowers (now widely cited as &quot;Convallaria keiskei&quot;)
* &quot;C. majalis&quot; var. &quot;majalis&quot; – from Eurasia, with white midribs on the flowers
* &quot;C. majalis&quot; var. &quot;montana&quot; – from the United States, maybe with green-tinted midribs on the flowers

&quot;Convallaria transcaucasica&quot; is recognised as a distinct species by some authorities, while the species formerly called &quot;Convallaria japonica&quot; is now classified as &quot;Ophiopogon japonicus&quot;.

==Distribution==
&quot;Convallaria majalis&quot; is a native of Europe, where it largely avoids the Mediterranean and Atlantic margins. An eastern variety, &quot;C. majalis&quot; var. &quot;keiskei&quot;, occurs in Japan and parts of eastern Asia. A limited native population of &quot;C. majalis&quot; var. &quot;montana&quot; (synonym &quot;C. majuscula&quot;) occurs in the Eastern United States. There is, however, some debate as to the native status of the American variety.

Like many perennial flowering plants, &quot;C. majalis&quot; exhibits dual reproductive modes by producing offspring asexually by vegetative means and sexually by seed, produced via the fusion of gametes.

==Ecology==
&quot;Convallaria majalis&quot; is a plant of partial shade, and a mesophile type that prefers warm summers. It likes soils that are silty or sandy and acid to moderately alkaline, with preferably a plentiful amount of humus. The Royal Horticultural Society states that slightly alkaline soils are the most favored. It is a Euroasiatic and suboceanic species that lives in mountains up to in elevation.

&quot;Convallaria majalis&quot; is used as a food plant by the larvae of some moth and butterfly (Lepidoptera) species including the grey chi. Adults and larvae of the leaf beetle &quot;Lilioceris merdigera&quot; are also able to tolerate the cardenolides and thus feed on the leaves.

==Cultivars==

&quot;Convallaria majalis&quot; is widely grown in gardens for its scented flowers and ground-covering abilities in shady locations. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. In favourable conditions it can form large colonies.

Various kinds and cultivars are grown, including those with double flowers, rose-colored flowers, variegated foliage and ones that grow larger than the typical species.
* &quot;C. majalis&quot; &#x27;Albostriata&#x27; has white-striped leaves
* &quot;C. majalis&quot; &#x27;Green Tapestry&#x27;, &#x27;Haldon Grange&#x27;, &#x27;Hardwick Hall&#x27;, &#x27;Hofheim&#x27;, &#x27;Marcel&#x27;, &#x27;Variegata&#x27; and &#x27;Vic Pawlowski&#x27;s Gold&#x27; are other variegated cultivars
* &quot;C. majalis&quot; &#x27;Berlin Giant&#x27; and &quot;C. majalis&quot; &#x27;Géant de Fortin&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Fortin&#x27;s Giant&#x27;) are larger-growing cultivars
* &quot;C. majalis&quot; &#x27;Flore Pleno&#x27; has double flowers.
* &quot;C. majalis&quot; &#x27;Rosea&#x27; sometimes found under the name &quot;C. majalis&quot; var. &quot;rosea&quot;, has pink flowers.

Traditionally, &quot;Convallaria majalis&quot; has been grown in pots and winter forced to provide flowers during the winter months, both in potted plants and as cut flowers.

==Chemistry==

Roughly 38 different cardiac glycosides (cardenolides) – which are highly toxic if consumed by humans or animals – occur in the plant, including:
The odor of lily of the valley, specifically the ligand bourgeonal, was once thought to attract mammalian sperm. The 2003 discovery of this phenomenon prompted research into odor reception, but a 2012 study demonstrated instead that at high concentrations, bourgeonal imitated the role of progesterone in stimulating sperm to swim (chemotaxis), a process unrelated to odor reception.

===Toxicology===
All parts of the plant are potentially poisonous, including the red berries which may be attractive to children. If ingested, the plant can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and irregular heartbeats.

==Uses==
===Perfume===
In 1956, the French firm Dior produced a fragrance simulating lily of the valley, which was Christian Dior&#x27;s favorite flower. Diorissimo was designed by Edmond Roudnitska. Although it has since been reformulated, it is considered a classic. Because no natural aromatic extract can be produced from lily of the valley, its scent must be recreated synthetically; while Diorissimo originally achieved this with hydroxycitronellal, the European Chemicals Agency now considers it a skin sensitizer and its use has been restricted.

Other perfumes imitating or based on the flower include Henri Robert&#x27;s Muguet de Bois (1936), Penhaligon&#x27;s Lily of the Valley (1976), and Olivia Giacobetti&#x27;s En Passant (2000).

===Weddings and other celebrations===

Lily of the valley has been used in weddings and off-season can be very expensive. Lily of the valley was featured in the bridal bouquet at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. Lily of the valley was also the flower chosen by Princess Grace of Monaco to be featured in her bridal bouquet.

At the beginning of the 20th century, it became tradition in France to sell lily of the valley on international Labour Day, 1 May (also called &quot;La Fête du Muguet&quot; or Lily of the Valley Day) by labour organisations and private persons without paying sales tax (on that day only) as a symbol of spring.

Lily of the valley is worn in Helston (Cornwall, UK) on Flora Day (8 May each year, see Furry Dance) representing the coming of &quot;the May-o&quot; and the summer. There is also a song sung in pubs around Cornwall (and on Flora Day in Cadgwith, near Helston) called &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot;; the song, strangely, came from the Jubilee Singers from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.

===Folk medicine===
The plant has been used in folk medicine for centuries. There is a reference to &quot;Lilly of the valley water&quot; in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1886 novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, where it is said to be &quot;good against the Gout&quot;, and that it &quot;comforts the heart and strengthens the memory&quot; and &quot;restores speech to those that have the dumb palsey&quot;. There is no scientific evidence that lily of the valley has any effective medicinal uses for treating human diseases.

==Cultural symbolism==

The lily of the valley was the national flower of Yugoslavia, and it also became the national flower of Finland in 1967.

In the &quot;language of flowers&quot;, the lily of the valley signifies the return of happiness.

===Myths and religion===

The name &quot;lily of the valley&quot;, like its correspondences in some other European languages, is apparently a reference to the phrase &quot;lily of the valleys&quot; (sometimes also translated as &quot;lily of the valley&quot;) in Song of Songs 2:1 (). European herbalists&#x27; use of the phrase to refer to a specific plant species seems to have appeared relatively late in the 16th or 15th century. The Neo-Latin term &quot;convallaria&quot; (coined by Carl Linnaeus) and, for example, the Swedish name &quot;&quot; derives from the corresponding phrase &quot;lilium convallium&quot; in the Vulgate.

==In culture==
* It is widely represented in the decorative arts.
* The flower is the theme of a poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar.
* Tchaikovsky wrote the poem &quot;Lilies of the Valley&quot; (Ландыши) in December 1878 while in Florence.
* In Anton Chekhov&#x27;s 1898 short story &quot;A Doctor&#x27;s Visit&quot;, drops of convallaria are mentioned as medicine.
* &quot;Lilies-of-the-Valley&quot; is a 1916 Marc Chagall painting,
* The eponymous song by English rock band Queen.
* The 46th episode of the television series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; includes lily of the valley&#x27;s use as a poison.
* In the third episode of Outlander, children are revealed to have been dying after confusing Lily of the Valley for garlic and eating it. 
* In 2022, lily of the valley, reputedly Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s favourite flower, was the theme of the poem &quot;Floral Tribute&quot; by the Poet Laureate Simon Armitage, written in memory of the Queen and published in the week after her death.

<text>Mudhoney is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, on January 1, 1988, following the demise of Green River. Its members are singer and rhythm guitarist Mark Arm, lead guitarist Steve Turner, bassist Guy Maddison and drummer Dan Peters. Original bassist Matt Lukin left the band in 1999, but rejoined the band in December 2000 for a tour that lasted through January 2001.

Mudhoney&#x27;s early releases on the Sub Pop label, particularly their debut single &quot;Touch Me I&#x27;m Sick&quot; and the &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot; EP, were instrumental in the creation of the grunge genre. Although the band found little commercial success and remained somewhat &#x27;underground&#x27; and non-mainstream, Mudhoney has released eleven studio albums and inspired countless grunge and alternative rock musicians during their long career.

==History==
===Mr. Epp and the Calculations: 1978–1984===
Mark Arm and Steve Turner met through their association with Mr. Epp and the Calculations. This band formed in 1978 in Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. While at Bellevue Christian High School, Mark McLaughlin (later known as Mark Arm) and some friends started Mr. Epp and the Calculations, a band named after a math teacher of his. Initially the band was essentially a joke band rather than a serious one; their first &quot;show&quot; was in class singing Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot;, using rolled-up maps as guitars because they could not actually play any instruments. Mr. Epp and the Calculations played their first real show in 1981, three years after they formed. To make the band seem more serious, Mr. Epp added a second guitarist, Steve Turner, who was in a small garage band called The Ducky Boys. Arm and Turner became instant friends. In 1983, three songs of Mr. Epp were included in &quot;First Strike&quot;: a compilation, the first cassette in the BCT catalog. Mr. Epp and the Calculations appeared on KZAM radio and were introduced as &quot;the worst band in the world.&quot; They played their last show on February 3, 1984, with Malfunkshun at Seattle&#x27;s Metropolis. Arm and Turner formed a joke-punk band called The Limp Richerds in 1984 near the end of Mr. Epp but this band ended shortly after Mr. Epp&#x27;s ending as well.

===Green River: 1984–1987===

Green River was formed in 1984 when Arm and Turner recruited Alex Vincent as drummer, who had previously played with Turner in the short-lived Spluii Numa. Bassist Jeff Ament joined the band after arriving in Seattle with his band Deranged Diction. Stone Gossard, another of Turner&#x27;s former bandmates, was recruited as second guitarist. Green River recorded their debut EP, &quot;Come on Down&quot;, in 1985, and it is considered the first grunge record because it was released several months before the &quot;Deep Six&quot; album (which featured music by Green River and five other Seattle grunge bands). Turner left the band after its release due to his distaste of the band&#x27;s hard rock leanings. He was replaced by another Deranged Diction member, Bruce Fairweather. After recording another EP (&quot;Dry As a Bone&quot;) and a full-length album (&quot;Rehab Doll&quot;), the band disbanded in late 1987. Gossard, Ament, and Fairweather went on to join Mother Love Bone. Following lead singer Andrew Wood&#x27;s death, Gossard and Ament went on to form Pearl Jam, and Fairweather joined Love Battery. 

===Sub Pop: 1988–1991===
Turner wanted to start a band that practiced before playing to a live audience. He and Arm began songwriting with Bundle of Hiss drummer Dan Peters. The trio decided that Matt Lukin, who had recently left Melvins, should join the band as bassist. The band named themselves after the Russ Meyer film &quot;Mudhoney&quot;. Early on, Mudhoney&#x27;s sound would reflect such influences as the Stooges, Spacemen 3, Wipers, Dinosaur Jr., Neil Young, Black Flag, and the Scientists.

In 1988, the band recorded and released their debut EP, &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot;, and their first single, &quot;Touch Me I&#x27;m Sick&quot;, on the Sub Pop label. The single attracted attention and the band enjoyed moderate success in the United States. Mudhoney quickly became Sub Pop&#x27;s flagship band. Sonic Youth, who were fans of the band, had invited Mudhoney to join them for a tour in the UK in 1989. After this tour &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot; entered the British indie charts and they received a respectable amount of press coverage. The band released their first album, &quot;Mudhoney&quot;, in 1989.

Kurt Cobain listed &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot; as one of his favourite albums in his journal in 1993.

They released their second album, &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge&quot;, in 1991. After the album&#x27;s release they were offered a deal with Reprise Records, and they joined the label in 1992.

===Reprise: 1992–1999===
Mudhoney&#x27;s first album with Reprise was &quot;Piece of Cake&quot;. In a 2008 &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine article, Turner explained the album references &quot;how easily things had come to them ... the songs were kinda half-baked ...&quot; They also contributed a track &quot;Overblown&quot; at this time to the soundtrack to the film &quot;Singles&quot;.

With their 1995 album &quot;My Brother the Cow&quot; they mixed their earlier and more recent sound, but Turner explained in an article in &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;There was a backlash after Kurt [Cobain] killed himself. The English press were so angry that we were still around. Those were some of the worst reviews we&#x27;d ever gotten. We were mocked for still existing.&quot; The press was not all negative, as the album received praise in certain U.S. publications, including &quot;People&quot; magazine: &quot;Leave the brooding anthems to Pearl Jam. Mudhoney delivers pure grunge—messy music that casts a powerful spell.&quot;

In 1996, Mudhoney appeared in the comedy movie &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, starring Chris Farley and David Spade. The band was shown performing at an MTV concert and then speaking with Farley backstage. &quot;Tomorrow Hit Today&quot; was released in September 1998. The album demonstrated a blues-rock influence, and the band used record producer Jim Dickinson, who worked with The Rolling Stones. They recorded the set in three different cities.

After a few years of touring, Reprise decided to cut ties with Mudhoney. Subsequently, Lukin left the band. They released &quot;March to Fuzz&quot;, a retrospective compilation album.

===After Matt Lukin: 2000–present===
Mudhoney continued to play some concerts in the Pacific Northwest and recruited permanent bassist Guy Maddison (of Monroe&#x27;s Fur and Lubricated Goat) who had played with Arm in one of his many side projects, Bloodloss. In 2002, following their return to Sub Pop, the band recorded and released a new studio album, &quot;Since We&#x27;ve Become Translucent&quot;. This was followed by a major South American tour.

In early 2003 the band entered the studio to record &quot;Hard-On For War&quot;, that would appear exclusively on &quot;Buddyhead Presents: Gimme Skelter&quot; compilation album. Later that year the band recorded &quot;Under a Billion Suns&quot; on which a new version of the song appeared. The album was released in 2006 and received favorable reviews. In 2006 the band also helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival.

During 2007, Mudhoney played in Brazil again and went on a brief European tour. In November that year, the band released a live album entitled &quot;Live Mud&quot;, containing songs recorded at a concert in Mexico.

In 2008, Mudhoney began recording their next album with producer Tucker Martine, &quot;The Lucky Ones&quot;, which was released in May 2008. Shortly thereafter, Sub Pop released a deluxe, remastered edition of &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot;. The reissue contained the original EP in its correct running order, along with singles, demos, and two live recordings from 1988. In the liner notes of the reissued &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot;, Jay Hinman wrote: My feeling—and I know I&#x27;m not alone in this one—is that for all the play and worldwide attention several Seattle-area bands got during the 1988–92 period, at the end of the day (and even at the time), there was Mudhoney—and then there was everybody else. To me, you, and everyone else paying close attention to underground rock music during those years, Mudhoney still sound like the undisputed kingpins of roaring, surging, fuzzed-out, punk music.

In 2009, Mudhoney announced a series of live dates. This included an extensive tour of Europe which started in Edinburgh, Scotland with Sub Pop labelmates The Vaselines. The tour ended on October 26. The group performed at the Nelsonville Music Festival in Nelsonville, Ohio, in May 2009. The group played at the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010, where they performed &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot; in its entirety.

In 2011, Pearl Jam had Mudhoney open for them on their 20th Anniversary tour. They were chosen by Mogwai to perform in May 2012 at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties &#x27;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&#x27; festival at Alexandra Palace, London. In April 2013 the band put out their ninth studio album &quot;Vanishing Point,&quot; followed by 2018&#x27;s &quot;Digital Garbage&quot;.

In 2021, Mudhoney and Sub Pop celebrated the 30-year anniversary of &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge&quot; with a remastered deluxe version. This included remastered and re-released music videos and songs, as well as previously unreleased songs and demos.

&quot;Plastic Eternity&quot; was released by Sub Pop on April 6, 2023.

<text>Chaumes is a cow&#x27;s milk cheese from Saint-Antoine-de-Breuilh in the Périgord in south west France, made by traditional cheese-making processes. Translated literally, &quot;chaumes&quot; is French for &quot;stubble&quot;.

Based upon traditional Trappist-style cheeses, it is a rather popular cheese among modern French varieties, in particular with children. It is a soft pale cheese with a rich full-bodied flavour and smooth, creamy and quite rubbery texture. Its aroma comes from the soft rind, which has a bright tangerine-orange color. The rind appears after several washings of the crust, along with brushing with some ferments.

Maturation of the Chaumes takes four weeks. It is used as a table cheese and also for grilling. It is also available in limited markets around France as a spreadable cream cheese, &quot;Chaumes la Crème&quot;.

<text>The United World Colleges (UWC) is an international network of schools and educational programmes with the shared aim of &quot;making education a force to unite people, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future.&quot; The organisation was founded on the principles of German educator Kurt Hahn in 1962 to promote intercultural understanding.

Today, UWC consists of 18 colleges on four continents. Young people from more than 155 countries are selected through a system of national committees and pursue the International Baccalaureate Diploma; some of the schools are also open to younger years. UWC runs the world&#x27;s largest scholarship programme in international secondary education, with over 80% of students selected by UWC national committees to attend one of the colleges receiving financial support. To date, there are almost 60,000 UWC alumni from all over the world.

The current President of UWC is Queen Noor of Jordan (1995–present). Former South African President Nelson Mandela was joint-President (1995–1999), alongside Queen Noor, and, subsequently, Honorary President of UWC (1999–2013). Former UWC presidents are Louis Mountbatten (1968–1977) and, when he was Prince of Wales, King Charles III (1978–1995).

The movement, including the colleges and national committees, are linked and coordinated by UWC International, which consists of the UWC International Board, the UWC International Council, and the UWC International Office (UWCIO), based in London and Berlin. These entities work together to set the global strategy for the movement, oversee fundraising, and approve new colleges. Faith Abiodun, who joined the movement in 2021, serves as executive director of the International Office, and Musimbi Kanyoro has been the chair of the International Board since 2019.

==History==

UWC was originally founded in the early 1960s to bridge the social, national and cultural divides apparent during the Second World War, and exacerbated by the Cold War. The first college in the movement, UWC Atlantic College in Wales, United Kingdom, was founded in 1962 by Kurt Hahn, a German educator who had previously founded Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, Gordonstoun in Scotland, the Outward Bound movement, and the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award Scheme.

Hahn envisaged a college educating boys and girls aged 16 to 19. He believed that schools should not simply be a means for preparing to enter university, but should help students prepare for life by developing resilience and the ability to experience both successes and failures. The selection would be based on personal motivation and potential, regardless of any social, economic or cultural factors. A scholarship programme would facilitate the recruitment of young people from different socio-economic backgrounds.

Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma was involved with Atlantic College from its early days, and encouraged the organisation to adopt the name &quot;United World Colleges&quot; and to open an international office with operations distinct from that of Atlantic College, to indicate a global reach and ambition beyond a single college. In 1967, he became the first president of United World Colleges, a position he held until 1977. Lord Mountbatten supported the organization by gaining support from heads of state and politicians and in fundraising activities. Under his presidency, the United World College of South East Asia was established in Singapore in 1971 (formally joining the UWC movement in 1975), followed by the United World College of the Pacific in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1974.

During the tenure of Prince Charles (now King Charles III) as president, he supervised the rapid growth of the movement, until it encompassed nine schools around the globe. Of Charles, UWC said, &quot;his work in raising the profile and vision of the UWC movement is still felt today&quot;.

==The Colleges==

There are currently 18 UWC schools and colleges in operation, with an international office in London and Berlin. UWC Simón Bolivar was a member of the movement until its closing in 2012 by the Venezuelan government.

== Academics ==
UWC values experiential learning alongside providing its 16–19-year-old students with the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, an internationally recognised pre-university educational programme developed in close collaboration with UWC in the late 1960s. The IB Diploma Programme was co-developed in 1968 by the United World College of the Atlantic, the International School of Geneva (Ecolint), and the United Nations School in New York City (UNIS), and aims &quot;to develop students who have excellent breadth and depth of knowledge – students who flourish physically, intellectually, emotionally and ethically&quot;. Today, UWC and the IB Organisation continue to work closely together to develop new curricula and shaping international education.

Five UWC schools (UWC Thailand, UWC South East Asia in Singapore, UWC Maastricht in the Netherlands, UWC East Africa in Tanzania, and Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa in Eswatini) also offer non-residential educational programmes for younger students aged between 18 months and 15 years.

Meanwhile, some UWC schools and colleges offer a Pre-IB Year as a preparation year for students before they begin their IB Diploma Programme. UWC schools and colleges that offer the Pre-IB Programme include, UWC Changshu in China, UWC South East Asia in Singapore, Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa in Eswatini, UWC Thailand, UWC ISAK Japan and UWC East Africa in Tanzania.

== Co-curricular Activities ==
The UWC education nurtures students&#x27; whole person development by having the &#x27;Creativity, Activity, Service&#x27; Programme (CAS) at its core. Each UWC school and college offers CAS activities under different names but similarly offers a wide range of both faculty and student led activities.

== Short courses ==
In addition to its colleges, UWC organises short courses on a range of topics. Short courses are hosted by UWC colleges, national committees in their home regions and UWC alumni groups. They embody the same experiential learning philosophy as the colleges, but without the academic programme, and usually have a duration of 1 – 4 weeks. Short courses were wholly in-person programmes until 2020 when the coordinators of Transforming Identity and Building a Sustainable Future short courses created the first online versions. Since then, online short courses have multiplied and become a core offering of UWC. The longest continuous running short course is the afforementioned Building a Sustainable Future, run by the National Committee of Germany, which has happened every year since 2016. In 2022, 889 participants between 14 and 20 years old attended 23 short courses (15 residential and 8 online) worldwide.

== Funding ==
The UWC model relies heavily on funding support of different philanthropists as well as national governments. In its early years, the United World College of the Atlantic and the UWC International Office were funded by the donations and grants from the Ford Foundation, the Dulverton Trust, and the Bernard Sunley trust, in addition to the British and West German governments, and many smaller funders; the site for Atlantic College, St Donat&#x27;s Castle, was donated for the college by Antonin Besse II. The colleges in Italy and Canada, in particular, receive significant support and funding from their national and local governments to this day, while the college in Mostar is a collaborative initiative with the IB Organization and was founded with support from various International organizations (including the OSCE, the EU, the CEB, and the UN).

More recently, the Davis-UWC Scholars Program was launched by Shelby M.C. Davis in 2000 and now supports UWC graduates to study at 99 selected US colleges and universities, and has grown to become the world&#x27;s largest, privately funded, international scholarship programme. In 2018, the Davis-UWC Dare to Dream Programme was launched with the support of Shelby M. C. Davis. In 2020, UWC announced a partnership with the Schmidt Futures and the Rhodes Trust, the Rise Programme, through which 15 students with refugee backgrounds will receive all-inclusive scholarships to attend across 3 years from 2021 to 2023, and further educational programmes will be delivered at Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya.

<text>Claudio Parra Pizarro (born September 14, 1945 in Viña del Mar) is a Chilean musician, pianist, and composer. He is one of the founders and current member of Chilean rock band Los Jaivas. He is an undisputed referent of the piano with a properly Chilean sound, and considered one of the most important in the history of popular music in Chile.

==Biography ==
Claudio is part of the Parra family of Viña del Mar, they are distant relatives of the Parra clan, from where Violeta Parra, Nicanor Parra and Roberto Parra, among others, emerged. Claudio became friends with Gato Alquinta at school, their friendship later led to the creation of the band.

The formal approach to music occurs under the influence of two family members: his uncle Ramón Parra Román (&quot;Uncle Moncho&quot;), who had been a talented classical piano soloist. And his aunt Gladys, who took him along with his brother, Eduardo, to concerts by the Chilean Symphony Orchestra and to presentations of the great Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau. Between the ages of eight and twelve, and thanks to these influences, Claudio began to cultivate classical music techniques.

When The High &amp; Bass –the original name of Los Jaivas– was formed, Claudio&#x27;s job was to play the accordion. Convinced by a professor at the Federico Santa María Technical University while studying engineering in 1965, Claudio decides to drop out, travel to Santiago and apply to the Conservatory of the University of Chile. Learning intensively, however, starting at nineteen years old at the conservatory is not an optimal age. Claudio manages to enter the Conservatory and becomes the only member of the group to have formal musical training. He moved from the accordion to the piano, an instrument that would characterize his work in the group&#x27;s most glorious years, and that would define an important part of his distinctive sound.

His knowledge of academic music has also led him to be the constant link between the band and the orchestras with which they have worked in their symphonic incursions, in such works as &quot;&quot;Letanias Por El Azar&quot;, &quot;Los Caminos Que Se Abren&quot;, &quot;Corre Que Te Pillo&quot;&quot; and the album &quot;Mamalluca&quot; (1999). The composition of melodies is his strength, and his characteristic piano is the one that guides songs as influential as &quot;&quot;La Conquistada&quot;, &quot;La Poderosa Muerte&quot; and &quot;Mira Niñita&quot;.&quot; However his influence is more noticeable in progressive works such as those heard in: &quot;Obras de Violeta Parra&quot; from 1984 and in his piano centric composition &quot;Elqui&quot;, which appears on the album: &quot;Mamalluca.&quot; But he has also executed interesting arrangements on synthesizers, such as those that adorn the song &quot;Amor Americano&quot; from the album &quot;Alturas de Machu Picchu,&quot; from 1981 and the complete album &quot;Si Tú No Estás&quot; from 1989.

Within the band, he is the inveterate collector, the one in charge of keeping the updated archive of the concerts and recordings of Los Jaivas, as well as the memories and the scores. Due to his sociable nature, he is the member of the group that has given the most interviews to the press, and in recent years he has been in charge of presenting the songs at concerts. After the death of Gato Alquinta, his function as the band&#x27;s &quot;musical director&quot; led him to be the one who trained and prepared Gato&#x27;s children, Eloy and Ankatu, to be his replacement.

In 2007 he received a tribute from the engineer Carolina Hernández at the Plaza de Armas in Santiago de Chile.

He is the only band member to have been in Los Jaivas since its inception.

<text>A high-explosive squash head (HESH), in British terminology, or a high-explosive plastic/plasticized (HEP), in American terminology, is a type of explosive projectile with plastic explosive that conforms to the surface of a target before detonating, which improves the transfer of explosive energy to the target. Squash head projectiles are similar to high-explosive projectiles and are well suited to many of the same targets. However, while HESH projectiles are not armour-piercing, they can defeat armored targets by causing spall, which can injure or kill a vehicle&#x27;s occupants or detonate some types of ammunition.

== Design ==
=== Function ===
HESH rounds are thin metal shells filled with plastic explosive and a delayed-action fuze at the base of the shell. On impact, the inert material, followed by plastic explosive, is &#x27;squashed&#x27; against the surface of the target and spreads out to form a disc or &#x27;pat&#x27; of explosive. The inert material helps prevent premature detonation of the plastic explosive and sustains the impact pressure and temperature.

Milliseconds later, the base fuze detonates the explosive, creating a shock wave that, owing to its large surface area and direct contact with the target, is transmitted through the material. In the metal armour of a tank, the compression shock wave is conducted through the armour to the point where it reaches the metal-air interface (the hollow crew compartment), where some of the energy is reflected as a tension wave, a phenomenon called &quot;impulsive loading&quot;. At the point where the compression and tension waves intersect, a high-stress zone is created in the metal, causing pieces of steel to be projected off the interior wall at high velocity.
=== Effect ===
This fragmentation by blast wave is known as &#x27;scabbing&#x27; or &#x27;spalling&#x27;, with the fragments termed &#x27;scabs&quot; or &#x27;spall&#x27;.

Depending upon the armour thickness, a heavy piece of target material ( for a round used in Arjun MBT) can separate out from the other end of the target with supersonic velocities. This spall is sufficient to permanently damage the essentials of a tank, igniting the ammunition or fuel storage and severely damaging the crew to achieve a &quot;total kill&quot; of the target. In general, the higher the armour thickness, the higher the scab weight will be.

The fragmentation achieved by impulsive loading of armour block by a HESH round is more lethal than similar high explosive rounds.
=== Use ===
HESH rounds are mostly fired from guns with rifled, rather than smoothbore, barrels. Rifling causes a projectile to spin, thereby allowing longer projectiles to be used, while at the same time improving accuracy. This also may make a HESH shell more effective on impact by increasing the surface area of contact for the explosive: the faster the spin, the larger the resultant contact patch. HESH shells are not specifically designed to perforate the armour of vehicles, unlike high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds, with their shaped charge jets. HESH shells rely instead on transmitting a shock wave through the solid steel armor.

HESH ammunition has good general purpose use, being effective against most targets, though the round is generally used at relatively low velocities (generally under ) because high velocity excessively disperses the pat of explosive. While only effective against tanks without spaced armour or spall liners, the round is still favoured for combat demolition purposes. The flattened high-velocity explosive pat can destroy concrete constructions much faster than a HEAT round (which is designed to penetrate armour), and without the dangerous fragmentation of a traditional high explosive (HE) fragmentation round.

== History ==
HESH was developed by Dennistoun Burney in the 1940s for the British war effort, originally as an anti-fortification &quot;wallbuster&quot; munition for use against concrete. He also led British developments in recoilless rifles as a means to deliver the shell. An early application of the HESH principle post WWII was the L9 165 mm demolition gun fitted to AVRE combat engineer vehicles.

HESH was found to be surprisingly effective against metallic armour as well as concrete structures. It was widely used as a primary round in most large calibre rifled guns.

== Users ==
HESH rounds were fielded mainly by the British Army as the main explosive round of its main battle tanks during the Cold War. It was also used by other military forces, especially those that acquired the early post-World War II British Royal Ordnance L7A1 tank gun, including Germany, India, Israel, and Sweden.

Since the 1980s, HESH ammunition has increasingly lost favour as armour designs have trended towards layered composites of hard metal and heat-resistant materials. This type of armour conducts shock waves poorly. Anti-spalling devices (&quot;spall liners&quot;), made of materials such as Kevlar, are commonly fitted to the interior surface of modern armoured vehicles to minimise spalling effects. Another reason for the declining use of HESH rounds is the preference of most armies using smoothbore guns due to the usage of powerful armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot, which would significantly decrease the rifled gun&#x27;s barrel life.

British Challenger 1 and Challenger 2 tanks, and India&#x27;s Arjun tank (which has the same rifled gun as the UK&#x27;s MBTs) use HESH rounds as their primary ammunition. Amongst other ammunition types, the Stryker Mobile Gun System variant is to be equipped with a HESH round for demolition and bunker-busting purposes. Argentina&#x27;s TAM medium tanks, Canada&#x27;s Leopard C1 and Leopard C2 main battle tanks (all of which mount the same gun as the Centurion), the Australian Leopard AS1 main battle tank, and the Chinese VT-4 main battle tank (which mounts a smoothbore gun) all use HESH rounds.

HESH rounds are also carried by armoured engineer vehicles; they are typically intended for use against fortifications rather than armoured fighting vehicles. A HESH round is used by the United States Army for the main gun of the M728 combat engineer vehicle, an M60 tank equipped with a bulldozer blade. Similarly, the UK&#x27;s Centurion AVRE was equipped with a short gun solely for a HESH shell.

<text>William Henry Pope (May 29, 1825 – October 7, 1879) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, journalist, judge and one of the Fathers of Confederation.

He was born in Bedeque, P.E.I. (Prince Edward Island), the son of Joseph Pope and Lucy Colledge. He was educated in England, but returned to Charlottetown where he studied law at the office of Edward Palmer. He became a lawyer in 1847. The editor of Prince Edward Island&#x27;s main Tory newspaper, &quot;The Islander&quot;, from 1859 to 1872, he entered politics in 1863.

He was named Colonial Secretary in 1859 even though he was not a part of the legislature because of a government experiment of having civil servants head the government departments. When he became a representative for the constituency of Belfast in 1863, he continued to hold that position. He was one of the hosts of the Charlottetown Conference in 1864.

An enthusiastic supporter of Canadian Confederation, he left the PEI cabinet in 1864 when the government rejected Confederation outright, but continued to press for union. The allocation of land was a key issue for Islanders in the 1860s; Pope opposed the idea of escheat, a common idea at the time. After this was accomplished in 1873 under the leadership of his brother, PEI Premier James Colledge Pope, he was appointed a county court judge. His son, Joseph Pope, became the private secretary to Canada&#x27;s first Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald and later wrote his biography &quot;The Day of Sir John Macdonald&quot;

Ardgowan, Pope&#x27;s residence, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1966. During the Charlottetown Conference, the Popes billetted George Brown and hosted a luncheon for delegates at Ardgowan.

Pope was a Freemason of Victoria Lodge in Charlottestown, at the time No. 383 under the Grand Lodge of Scotland, but today No. 2 under the Grand Lodge of Prince Edward Island.

<doc id="238470" wikidata="Q374504" url="?curid=238470" title="Barnett Newman">
<text>Barnett Newman (January 29, 1905 – July 4, 1970) was an American painter. He has been critically regarded as one of the major figures of abstract expressionism, and one of the foremost color field painters. His paintings explore the sense of place that viewers experience with art and incorporate the simplest forms to emphasize this feeling.

==Early life==
Barnett Newman was born in New York City, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland. He studied philosophy at the City College of New York and worked in his father&#x27;s business manufacturing clothing. He later made a living as a teacher, writer, and critic. From the 1930s, he made paintings, said to be in an expressionist style, but eventually destroyed all these works. Newman met Annalee Greenhouse in 1934 while both were working as substitute teachers at Grover Cleveland High School; they were married on June 30, 1936.

==Career==

Newman wrote catalogue forewords and reviews as well as organized exhibitions, He then became a member of the Uptown Group and had his first solo show at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Newman remarked in one of the Artists&#x27; Session at Studio 35: &quot;We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image.&quot; Using his writing skills, Newman fought to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, &quot;Letter to Sidney Janis: ... it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&quot;

Throughout the 1940s, he worked in a surrealist vein, then developed his signature style. This is characterized by areas of color separated by thin vertical lines, or &quot;zips&quot; as Newman called them. In the first works featuring zips, the color fields are variegated, but later the colors are pure and flat. Newman thought that he reached his fully distinct, signature style with the &quot;Onement&quot; series (from 1948). The zips define the spatial structure of the painting and simultaneously divide and unite the composition. According to art historian April Kingsley, the zip in Newman&#x27;s paintings are &#x27;flashing light of a nuclear explosion and the old testament pillar of fire&#x27;, thus mixing the paradox of romantic sublime with the depiction of destruction and transcendence. Already 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America&#x27;s newest art movement and included a list of &quot;the men in the new movement.&quot; Ex-surrealists, like Matta, are mentioned, and Wolfgang Paalen is mentioned twice with Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, Gorky and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.
The zip remained a constant feature of Newman&#x27;s work throughout his life. In some paintings of the 1950s, such as &quot;The Wild&quot;, which is eight feet tall by one and a half inches wide (2.43 meters by 4.1 centimeters), the zip is all there is to the work. Newman also made a few sculptures which are essentially three-dimensional zips.

Although Newman&#x27;s paintings appear to be purely abstract, and many of them were originally untitled, the names he later gave them hinted at specific subjects being addressed, often with a Jewish theme. Two paintings from the early 1950s, for example, are called &quot;Adam and Eve&quot;. There is also &quot;Uriel&quot; (1954), and &quot;Abraham&quot; (1949), a very dark painting which, as well as being the name of a biblical patriarch, was the name of Newman&#x27;s father, who had died in 1947.
&quot;The Stations of the Cross&quot; series of black and white paintings (1958–1966), begun shortly after Newman had recovered from a heart attack, usually is regarded as the peak of his achievement. The series is subtitled &quot;Lema sabachthani&quot; - &quot;Why have you forsaken me&quot; - the last words spoken by Jesus on the cross, according to the New Testament. Newman saw these words as having universal significance in his own time. The series has been seen as a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.
Newman&#x27;s late works, such as the &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue&quot; series, use vibrant, pure colors, often on very large canvases - &quot;Anna&#x27;s Light&quot; (1968), named in memory of his mother, who had died in 1965, is his largest work, 28 feet wide by 9 feet tall (8.5 by 2.7 meters). Newman also worked on shaped canvases late in life, with &quot;Chartres&quot; (1969), for example, being triangular, and returned to sculpture, making a small number of sleek pieces in steel. These later paintings are executed in acrylic paint rather than the oil paint of earlier pieces. Of his sculptures, &quot;Broken Obelisk&quot; (1963) is the most monumental and best-known, depicting an inverted obelisk whose point balances on the apex of a pyramid.
Newman also made a series of lithographs, the &quot;18 Cantos&quot; (1963–64) which, according to Newman, are meant to be evocative of music. He also made a small number of etchings.

In 1948, Newman, William Baziotes, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell and David Hare founded the Subjects of the Artist School at 35 East 8th Street. These Well-attended lectures were open to the public, with speakers such as Jean Arp, John Cage and Ad Reinhardt, but the art school failed financially and closed in the spring of 1949. Newman generally is classified as an abstract expressionist because his working in New York City in the 1950s, associating with other artists of the group and developing an abstract style which owed little or nothing to European art. However, his rejection of the expressive brushwork employed by other abstract expressionists, such as Clyfford Still and Mark Rothko, and his use of hard-edged areas of flat color, can be seen as a precursor to post painterly abstraction and the minimalist works of artists such as Frank Stella.

Newman was unappreciated as an artist for much of his life, being overlooked in favor of more colorful characters such as Jackson Pollock. The influential critic Clement Greenberg wrote enthusiastically about him, but it was not until the end of his life that he began to be taken seriously. He was, however, an important influence on many younger artists such as Donald Judd, Frank Stella and Bob Law.
==Legacy==
Newman died on July 4, 1970, aged 65, of a heart attack, in New York City.

Nine years after Newman&#x27;s death, his widow Annalee founded the Barnett Newman Foundation. The foundation functions as his official estate and serves &quot;to encourage the study and understanding of Barnett Newman&#x27;s life and works.&quot; The foundation was instrumental in creating Newman&#x27;s catalogue raisonné in 2004. The U.S. copyright representative for the Barnett Newman Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.

In 2018, the Foundation gave more than 70 artworks to the Jewish Museum, New York.

==Selected collections==
Several public collections hold works by Barnett Newman. These include:
==Art market==
After Newman had an artistic breakthrough in 1948, he and his wife decided that he should devote all his energy to his art. They lived almost entirely off Annalee Newman&#x27;s teaching salary until the late 1950s, when Newman&#x27;s paintings began to sell consistently. &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1952), a blue-and-black striped painting, sold in 1985 for $1,595,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s to an American collector who was not identified. Consigned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and previously part of Frederick R. Weisman&#x27;s collection, Newman&#x27;s 8.5-by-10-foot &quot;Onement VI&quot; (1953) was sold for a record $43.8 million at Sotheby&#x27;s New York in 2013; its sale was ensured by an undisclosed third-party guarantee. This was eclipsed on May 13, 2014, when &quot;Black Fire 1&quot; sold for $84.2 million.

<text>John William Ritchie (March 26, 1808 – December 13 or 18, 1890) was a Canadian lawyer and politician from Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia who is one of the Fathers of Confederation.

Appointed to the Nova Scotia legislative council as Solicitor General in 1864, he was a delegate to the London Conference on Canadian Confederation and as such is considered one of the Fathers of Confederation. Appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1867, he was a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia from 1873 to 1882. His younger brother, William Johnstone Ritchie, was Chief Justice of Canada. His daughter was Eliza Ritchie.

Ritchie died at his estate in the Northwest Arm of Halifax and is buried at St. John&#x27;s Cemetery.

==Early life and education==
John William Ritchie was born in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, on March 26, 1808. His father, Thomas Ritchie, was a lawyer, judge, and politician; his mother was named Elizabeth Wildman Johnston. Ritchie was likely educated in Annapolis Royal, at Ichabod Corbett&#x27;s school. Instead of going to college, he received at-home tutoring. Ritchie later studied law with his uncle, James William Johnston, in Halifax during the mid-1820s. In January 1831, he became an attorney; the following year, he became a barrister. Ritchie pursued further studies when his first decade of practice proved unsuccessful.

<text>The Senedd ( ; ), officially known as the Welsh Parliament in English and  () in Welsh, is the devolved, unicameral legislature of Wales. A democratically elected body, it makes laws for Wales, agrees to certain taxes, and scrutinises the Welsh Government. It is a bilingual institution, with both Welsh and English being the official languages of its business. From its creation in May 1999 until May 2020, the Senedd was officially known as the National Assembly for Wales () and was often simply called the Welsh Assembly.

The Senedd comprises 60 members who are known as members of the Senedd (), abbreviated as &quot;MS&quot; (). Since 2011, members are elected for a five-year term of office under an additional member system, in which 40 MSs represent smaller geographical divisions known as &quot;constituencies&quot; and are elected by first-past-the-post voting, and 20 MSs represent five &quot;electoral regions&quot; using the D&#x27;Hondt method of proportional representation. Typically, the largest party in the Senedd forms the Welsh Government.

A National Assembly for Wales was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, following the result of the 1997 referendum. The Assembly initially had no powers to make primary legislation. Limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, meaning that the UK Parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales were no longer consulted when passing acts of the National Assembly for Wales related to the 20 devolved areas. These powers were further extended by the Wales Act 2014 and Wales Act 2017, with the latter moving the Assembly to a reserved powers model of devolution like that of the Scottish Parliament. In May 2020, the Assembly was renamed to &quot;Senedd Cymru&quot; or &quot;the Welsh Parliament&quot; when section 2 of the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Act 2020 came into force. The Senedd&#x27;s powers in economic matters are significantly restricted by the UK Internal Market Act 2020, a primary purpose of which is to constrain the capacity of the devolved institutions to use their regulatory autonomy. Matters devolved to the Senedd include health, education, economic development, transport, the environment, agriculture, local government and some taxes.

==History==

===Road to devolution===

An appointed Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was established in 1949 to &quot;ensure the government is adequately informed of the impact of government activities on the general life of the people of Wales&quot;. The council had 27 members nominated by local authorities in Wales, the University of Wales, National Eisteddfod Council and the Welsh Tourist Board. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 and the post of Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office were established in 1964 leading to the abolition of the Council for Wales. The establishment of the Welsh Office effectively created the basis for the territorial governance of Wales. The Royal Commission on the Constitution (the Kilbrandon Commission) was set up in 1969 by Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Government to investigate the possibility of devolution for Scotland and Wales. Its recommendations formed the basis of the 1974 White paper &quot;Democracy and Devolution: proposals for Scotland and Wales&quot;, which proposed the creation of a Welsh Assembly. However, Welsh voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposals in a referendum held in 1979.

Following the 1997 general election, the new Labour Government argued that an Assembly would be more democratically accountable than the Welsh Office. For eleven years prior to 1997 Wales had been represented in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom by a Secretary of State who did not represent a Welsh constituency at Westminster. A referendum was held in Wales on 18 September 1997 in which voters approved the creation of the National Assembly for Wales with a total of 559,419 votes, or 50.3% of the vote.

The following year the Government of Wales Act was passed by the United Kingdom parliament, establishing the Assembly. On 1 July 1999 the powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the Assembly and the Welsh Office ceased to exist.

In July 2002, the Welsh Government established an independent commission, with Lord Richard (former leader of the House of Lords) as chair, to review the powers and electoral arrangements of the National Assembly to ensure that it is able to operate in the best interests of the people of Wales. The Richard Commission reported in March 2004. It recommended that the National Assembly should have powers to legislate in certain areas, whilst others would remain the preserve of Westminster. It also recommended changing the electoral system to the single transferable vote (STV) which would produce greater proportionality.

In response, the British government, in its &quot;Better Governance for Wales&quot; White Paper, published on 15 June 2005, proposed a more permissive law-making system for the Welsh Assembly based on the use of Parliamentary Orders in Council. In so doing, the Government rejected many of the cross party Richard Commission&#x27;s recommendations. This has attracted criticism from opposition parties and others.

===Enhanced powers: The Government of Wales Act 2006===

The Government of Wales Act 2006 received Royal assent on 25 July 2006. It conferred on the Assembly legislative powers similar to other devolved legislatures through the ability to pass Assembly Measures concerning matters that are devolved. Requests for further legislative powers made through legislative competence requests were subject to the veto of the Secretary of State for Wales, House of Commons or House of Lords.

The Act reformed the assembly to a parliamentary-type structure, establishing the Welsh Government as an entity separate from, but accountable to the National Assembly. It enables the Assembly to legislate within its devolved fields.

The Act also reforms the Assembly&#x27;s electoral system. It prevents individuals from standing as candidates in both constituency and regional seats. This aspect of the act was subject to a great deal of criticism, most notably from the Electoral Commission., although it was supported in the Richard Commission

The Act was heavily criticised. Plaid Cymru, the Official Opposition in the National Assembly from 1999 to 2007, attacked it for not delivering a fully-fledged parliament. Many commentators have also criticised the Labour Party&#x27;s allegedly partisan attempt to alter the electoral system. By preventing regional Members from standing in constituency seats the party has been accused of changing the rules to protect constituency representatives. Labour had 29 members in the Assembly at the time, all of whom held constituency seats.

The changes to the Assembly&#x27;s powers were commenced on 4 May 2007, after the election.

Following a referendum on 3 March 2011, the Welsh Assembly gained direct law making powers, without the need to consult Westminster.

===Reserved powers model: The Wales Act 2017===
The Conservative-Liberal coalition government created the Commission on Devolution in Wales (also known as Silk Commission), composed of members nominated by the 4 parties represented in the Welsh Assembly and several leading legal and political experts, to &quot;create a lasting devolution settlement for Wales&quot;. Following the first set of recommendations by the Commission, the UK government announced in November 2013 that some borrowing powers are to be devolved to the Assembly along with control of landfill tax and stamp duty. Additionally the Wales Act 2014 provides for a referendum to be held on the Assembly&#x27;s ability to set a degree of income tax, though there is a proposal for the requirement for a referendum to be removed.

Both the UK and Welsh governments supported the Silk Commission (Part 2) proposal to move to a &quot;reserved powers&quot; model of devolution (similar to that of the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly) where the UK government would have specific &quot;reserved&quot; powers and the Welsh Assembly would have control of all other matters. This replaced the previous model where certain powers were &quot;conferred&quot; and all others were assumed to be powers of the UK national government. Since the passing of the Wales Act 2017, the power model in Wales has been in line with that of Scotland, being a reserved matter model.

The Wales Act 2017, based on the second set of recommendations of the Silk Commission, proposed devolving further areas of government, including some relating to water, marine affairs (ports, harbours, conservation), energy (subsidies, petroleum extraction, construction of smaller energy-generating facilities, etc.), rail franchising and road travel.

===Name change===
In July 2016, Assembly members unanimously agreed that the name of the Assembly should reflect its constitutional status as a national parliament. The Assembly Commission ran a public consultation on the proposal, which showed that 61% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the Assembly should change its name. In 2018, the commission announced its intention to introduce legislation to change the name of the Assembly. Later that year, the Llywydd – the Assembly&#x27;s presiding officer – wrote to all Assembly Members explaining that the name change proposed in the Bill would be the monolingual name &quot;Senedd&quot;. In 2019, the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Bill, favouring the name &quot;Senedd&quot;, was introduced on behalf of the Assembly Commission. Following support of a subsequent amendment to the Bill which favoured a bilingual name for the institution, the Bill was passed by the Assembly on 27 November 2019 and was given Royal Assent on 15 January 2020. The Act changed the name of the Assembly to &quot;Senedd Cymru&quot; or the &quot;Welsh Parliament&quot;. Its guidance states that the institution will be commonly known as the &quot;Senedd&quot; in both languages. The name change came into effect on 6 May 2020. Members of the renamed body are known as Members of the Senedd (MS), or Aelodau o&#x27;r Senedd (AS) in Welsh.

===Constraints on powers: UK Internal Market Act 2020===
As part of the process of leaving the European Union, the Conservative Party in power in Westminster passed the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020. This legislation aims to prevent internal trade barriers within the UK, and to restrict the exercise of legislative powers of the devolved administrations in economic areas. It has several effects on the constitutional arrangements regarding devolved legislative powers. Principal amongst these is the effect that the market access principles will have on the practical ability of the devolved administrations to regulate economic activity. It also expressly reserves the regulation of distortive or harmful subsidies to the UK Government, and gives them spending powers in numerous policymaking areas.

These powers undermine the authority of the Senedd to determine infrastructure priorities within its jurisdiction. The principles undermine devolved competences in two ways. These relate to its status as a protected enactment, and to the disproportionate market size and power of the economy under English jurisdiction. Because the Senedd will be unable to disapply the market access principles, if they attempt to introduce new or stricter regulatory standards, they will only apply to goods produced within the devolved jurisdiction. This means that these standards will have little or no practical effect other than to disadvantage their own economy, severely restricting their ability to introduce regulatory divergence, or pursue different economic or social choices to those made in Westminster.

===Expansion===

On 22 November 2021, Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru agreed a co-operation deal that will see the implementation of 46 policies that the two parties share. One of these is the expansion of the Senedd from 60 Members to between 80 and 100 Members.

At its Conference on 12 March 2022, Welsh Labour unanimously approved increasing the size of the Senedd. &quot;The expansion of the Senedd is essential because the journey of devolution is not yet complete,&quot; former First Minister Alun Michael said. &quot;There is more to come. And the capacity needs to be there for those backbenchers to do the job of holding to account that you rightly said, cannot be done by to smaller number of representatives.&quot; Two weeks later, Plaid members backed the expansion proposal as well.

On 10 May 2022, plans to increase the number of MSs from 60 to 96 were unveiled, as well as the scrapping of first past the post, which is currently used to elect 40 of the 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). Drakeford said these changes were required as &quot;report after report&quot; had demonstrated that the Senedd in its current form &quot;cannot do the job in the way that people in Wales have a right to expect it to be done&quot;. Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds criticised these plans, claiming that they would disproportionately impact smaller parties.

On 8 June 2022, the Senedd voted 40-14 in favour of expanding the number of MSs.

In 2023, the reform bill committee heard reforms included taking 32 new constituencies created that will be used in the 2024 general election and pairing them to create 16 Senedd constituencies – with each returning six members in multi-member districts. Opposition to the proposed closed list voting system was expressed by some Labour and Plaid Cymru representatives, while opposition to the overall expansion of the Senedd was expressed by some Labour representatives and the Conservatives.

==Buildings==
===Senedd building===
The debating chamber in Cardiff Bay, the &quot;Senedd&quot; (&quot;Senate&quot;), was designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, and built by Taylor Woodrow, with environmental, mechanical, electrical and plumbing design by BDSP Partnership. It uses traditional Welsh materials, such as slate and Welsh oak, in its construction, and the design is based around the concepts of openness and transparency. The timber ceiling and centre funnel, manufactured and installed by BCL Timber Projects (sub-contracted by Taylor Woodrow) is made from Canadian sourced Western Red Cedar.
 
The Senedd houses the debating chamber known as the Siambr () and Committee Rooms. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on Saint David&#x27;s Day, 1 March 2006.

The Senedd is designed to be environmentally friendly: it uses an Earth Heat Exchange system for heating; rainwater is collected from the roof and used for flushing toilets and cleaning windows, and the roof features a wind cowl which funnels natural light and air into the debating chamber below.

=== Telecasting ===
The building houses the debating chamber and committee rooms for the Senedd. When the Senedd building opened on 1 March 2006, there was regular screening of live proceedings from the Siambr on S4C2 and also on internet television. Coverage of the S4C2 screenings were on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays between 9:00 am 6:00 pm when the Senedd was sitting. In addition, limited screens were shown on the BBC Two Wales programme &quot;am.pm&quot;, including First Minister&#x27;s Questions. These were decommissioned after S4C2 switched its scheduling to children programs and because of budget cuts. Internet television screenings are now shown on the Senedd&#x27;s own website called Senedd.tv, which screens approximately 35 hours of content each week in English and Welsh. The service began 15 April 2008. Key events such as First Minister&#x27;s Questions are shown live and recorded on BBC Parliament on television and on iPlayer. Also on BBC Parliament some proceedings are shown as highlights of the week on the programme The Week in Parliament.

In October 2023, GB News was banned from the Senedd&#x27;s internal TV system, with a spokesperson for the presiding officer claiming the channel was &quot;deliberately offensive, demeaning to public debate and contrary to our parliament&#x27;s values&quot;.

===Tŷ Hywel and Pierhead Building===

The debating chamber was initially based in Tŷ Hywel, next to the site of the present building. The offices of Members are still in this building which is connected to the Senedd by a skyway. The Senedd Commission is also responsible for the Pierhead Building, which is the location of &quot;The Assembly at the Pierhead&quot; exhibition, and is the Visitor and Education Centre for the Senedd as well as housing a small gift shop. The exhibition, currently still in the process of being updated following the 2016 National Assembly for Wales election, provides visitors with information on who&#x27;s who, what&#x27;s happening and how the Senedd works.

===North Wales Office===
The Senedd North Wales Office is located at Government Buildings, Llandudno Junction. The office is open to the public to access information about the Senedd on weekdays between 10:00 and 12:00 and 14:00 and 16:00. Previously the office was located at Prince&#x27;s Park, Colwyn Bay.

==Officials==
===Elected officials===
After each election, the Senedd elects one Member of the Senedd to serve as Llywydd (Presiding Officer) of the Senedd, and another to serve as Deputy Presiding Officer (Dirprwy Llywydd). Elin Jones, Plaid Cymru MS, has been Llywydd since 2016, having taken over from Rosemary Butler. The Llywydd also acts as Chair of the Senedd Commission. Both the Llywydd and the Deputy Presiding Officer (Dirprwy Lywydd) typically don&#x27;t vote in simple-majority votes.

===Permanent officials===
The permanent administrative and support staff of the Senedd are employed by the Senedd Commission. They are not civil servants, although they enjoy similar terms and conditions of service to members of the UK Civil Service. The most senior permanent official is the chief executive and clerk, and the position is currently held by Manon Antoniazzi.

==Powers and status==

The Senedd consists of 60 elected members. They use the title Member of the Senedd (MS) or &quot;Aelod o&#x27;r Senedd&quot; (AS). The executive arm of the Senedd, the Welsh Government, has been a Labour administration since its inception in 1999. Currently it is led by First Minister, Eluned Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Ely, since August 2024. The government between 2007 and 2011, had been a coalition between Labour, led by First Minister Carwyn Jones and Plaid Cymru, led by Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones; and between 2016 and 2021, Labour had been in coalition with the Liberal Democrats and an independent member. Since 2021, the government has been a Labour minority government. The executive and civil servants are mainly based in Cardiff&#x27;s Cathays Park while the MSs, the Senedd Commission and Ministerial support staff are based in Cardiff Bay, where a new £67 million building, the Senedd, has been built.

One important feature of the National Assembly until 2007 was that there was no legal or constitutional separation of the legislative and executive functions, since it was a single corporate entity. Compared with other parliamentary systems, and arrangements for devolution in other countries of the UK, this was unusual. In practice, however, there was separation of functions, and the terms &quot;Assembly&quot; and &quot;Assembly Parliamentary Service&quot; came into use to distinguish between the two arms. The Government of Wales Act 2006 regularised the separation when it came into effect following the 2007 Assembly Election.

Initially, the Assembly did not have primary legislative or fiscal powers, as these powers were reserved by Westminster. The Assembly did have powers to pass secondary legislation in devolved areas. Sometimes secondary legislation could be used to amend primary legislation, but the scope of this was very limited. For example, the first Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly power to amend primary legislation relating to the merger of certain public bodies. However, most secondary powers were conferred on the executive by primary legislation to give the executive (i.e. Ministers) more powers, and the Assembly had wider legislative powers than appearances might suggest. For example, the Assembly delayed local elections due to be held in 2003 for a year by use of secondary powers, so that they would not clash with Assembly elections. In 2001 the UK parliament used primary legislation to delay for one month local elections in England during the Foot-and-mouth disease epidemic.

The Assembly gained limited primary legislative powers following the 2007 election and the passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006. These laws are known as Assembly Measures and can be enacted in specific fields and matters within the legislative competency of the Assembly. New matters and fields can be devolved by Acts of the UK Parliament or by LCOs approved by Parliament.

Until 2015 the Assembly had no tax-varying powers, however it could influence the rate of Council Tax set by local authorities, which are part-funded by a grant from the Welsh government. It also has some discretion over charges for government services. Notable examples in which this discretion has been used to create significant differences from other areas in the UK are:

# &quot;Charges for NHS prescriptions in Wales&quot; – these have now been abolished.
# &quot;Charges for University Tuition&quot; – are different for Welsh resident students studying at Welsh Universities, compared with students from or studying elsewhere in the UK.
# &quot;Charging for Residential Care&quot; – In Wales there is a flat rate of contribution towards the cost of nursing care (roughly comparable to the highest level of English Contribution) for those who require residential care.

This means in reality that there is a wider definition of &quot;nursing care&quot; than in England and therefore less dependence on means testing in Wales than in England, so that more people are entitled to higher levels of state assistance. These variations in the levels of charges may be viewed as &quot;de facto&quot; tax varying powers.

This model of more limited legislative powers created in 1999 was partly because Wales has had the same legal system as England since 1536 (though a different court system until 1830), when it was merged with England. Ireland and Scotland were never merged with England, and so always retained some differences in their legal systems. The Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly both have deeper and wider powers.

The Assembly inherited the powers and budget of the Secretary of State for Wales and most of the functions of the Welsh Office. It has power to vary laws passed by Westminster using secondary legislation.

Following a referendum on 4 March 2011, the Welsh Assembly gained direct law-making powers (without the need to consult Westminster).
On 3 July 2012, the Welsh Assembly passed its first Act, the Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Act.

The Wales Act 2014 and Wales Act 2017 devolved the following taxes to the Welsh Assembly:
* Non-Domestic Rates in Wales – from 1 April 2015
* Land Transaction Tax (LTT) – from 1 April 2018
* Landfill Disposals Tax (LDT) – from 1 April 2018
* Welsh Rates of Income Tax (WRIT) – from 1 April 2019

===Powers of the Senedd===

The Senedd has the competence to pass bills for Acts of Senedd Cymru in all areas which are not explicitly reserved to Westminster; these &#x27;reserved matters&#x27; are outlined in schedule 7A of the Government of Wales Act 2006.

This means the Senedd has powers over areas such as:

* Agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development
* Culture
* Economic development
* Education and training
* Environment
* Health and health services
* Highways and transport
* Local government
* Tourism
* Welsh language

Reserved matters include subjects such as:
* Foreign affairs
* Police and justice
* Currency
* Most benefits
* Most taxes
* Defence

==Members, constituencies, and electoral system==


Under the Additional Member System, forty of the MSs are elected from single-member constituencies on a plurality voting system (or &quot;first past the post&quot;) basis, the constituencies being equivalent to those used for the House of Commons and twenty MSs are elected from regional closed lists using an alternative party vote. There are five regions: Mid and West Wales, North Wales, South Wales Central, South Wales East and South Wales West (these are the same as the pre 1999 European Parliament constituencies for Wales), each of which returns four members. The additional members produce a degree of proportionality within each region. Whereas voters can choose any regional party list irrespective of their party vote in the constituency election, list MSs are not elected independently of the constituency element; rather, elected constituency MSs are deemed to be pre-elected list representatives for the purposes of calculating remainders in the D&#x27;Hondt method. Overall proportionality is limited by the low proportion of list members (33% of the Senedd compared with 43% in the Scottish Parliament and 50% in the German &quot;Bundestag&quot;), the regionalisation of the list element, and the lack of overhang seat compensation and leveling seats. Consequently, the Senedd as a whole has a greater degree of proportionality (based on proportions in the list elections) than the plurality voting system used for British parliamentary elections, but still deviates somewhat from proportionality.

With the recently passed Senedd Cymru (members and elections) Act 2024 the voting system will be changed to a closed list proportional representation system using the D’Hondt method with 6 seat constituencies. This will be enacted in 2026 and may be used for the next election if it is scheduled for after then.

In April 2020 the Senedd became the first legislature in the UK to meet over the internet. Due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it held First Minister&#x27;s Questions using Zoom videotelephony software and the session was subsequently broadcast by Senedd.tv.

==Elections==
There have been six elections to the Senedd, in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2016 and 2021. The 2016 election was delayed from 2015 as the UK general election was held in 2015, and following the passing of the Wales Act 2014, elections occur every five years from the 2016 election.

The next Senedd election is due to be held on Thursday 7 May 2026.

===Turnout===
Voter turnout at Senedd elections has been traditionally lower than UK general elections. No election since devolution began has hit 50% turnout, with the 2021 election being the highest at 46.6%. In their 2004 paper &quot;Turnout, Participation and Legitimacy in Post-Devolution Wales&quot;, academics Roger Awan-Scully, Richard Wyn Jones and Dafydd Trystan Davies identified three potential reasons for this: antipathy to the Welsh institutions, apathy to the Welsh institutions or apathy to politics more generally. They suggested apathy – in Wales and to politics in general – is the most likely reason.

Following the 2021 election, Dr Jac Larner, a politics lecturer at Cardiff University and an investigator for the Welsh election survey, said the lower turnout figures in Wales did not necessarily reflect a lack of perceived importance in the Senedd. He told BBC News: &quot;We know from research that low voter turnout is actually a lot do to with people thinking they can&#x27;t win in a devolved election, so they don&#x27;t bother going to vote. That&#x27;s different to a general election where, in Wales, Labour are still more likely to win a majority of seats, but at the UK level it&#x27;s far more competitive.&quot; He compared turnout in Wales to turnout for Scottish Parliament elections, which is significantly higher: &quot;Scotland is in quite a unique political position at the moment, where the single most salient issue and the biggest cleavage in society – the issue of independence – basically is going to be determined by what happens at the Holyrood elections. Part of it is this idea of interest – there has always been more interest in the idea of a Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Parliament has always been more powerful than the Senedd, even going back to 1999.&quot;

==Current composition==
===Government formation===
Welsh Labour won 30 seats out of 60 in the 2021 Senedd elections. On 9 May 2021 the First Minister, Mark Drakeford MS said &quot;We have demonstrated over a number of governments that you can govern successfully on 30 seats, but I&#x27;m open to working with any party where there is common ground between us.&quot;

On 22 November 2021, a deal between Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru was announced. The agreement was not one which saw Plaid Cymru entering a coalition in government with Labour, with Plaid Cymru MSs remaining in opposition. However, Plaid Cymru were able to appoint special advisors to the Welsh Government in a deal which was designed to last for three years. On 17 May 2024, Plaid Cymru announced it would uniliaterally exit the agreement due to concerns with the Labour government&#x27;s ethics.

<text>The Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank (PIAT) Mk I was a British man-portable anti-tank weapon developed during the Second World War. The PIAT was designed in 1942 in response to the British Army&#x27;s need for a more effective infantry anti-tank weapon and entered service in 1943.

The PIAT was based on the spigot mortar system, and projected (launched) a 2.5 pound (1.1 kg) shaped charge bomb using a cartridge in the tail of the projectile. It possessed an effective range of approximately in a direct fire anti-tank role, and in an indirect fire role. The PIAT had several advantages over other infantry anti-tank weapons of the period: it had greatly increased penetration power over the previous anti-tank rifles, it had no back-blast which might reveal the position of the user or accidentally injure friendly soldiers around the user, and it was simple in construction. However, the device also had some disadvantages: powerful recoil, a difficulty in cocking the weapon, and early problems with ammunition reliability.

The PIAT was first used during the Tunisian campaign in 1943, and remained in use with British and other Commonwealth forces until the early 1950s. PIATs were supplied to or obtained by other nations and forces, including the Soviet Union (through Lend Lease), the French resistance, the Polish Underground, and the Israeli Haganah (which used PIATs during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War). Six members of the British and other Commonwealth armed forces received Victoria Crosses for their use of the PIAT in combat.

==Development==
At the beginning of the Second World War, the British Army possessed two primary anti-tank weapons for its infantry: the Boys anti-tank rifle and the No. 68 AT rifle grenade. However, neither of these was particularly effective as an anti-tank weapon. The No. 68 anti-tank grenade was designed to be fired from a discharger fitted onto the muzzle of an infantryman&#x27;s rifle, but this meant that the grenade was too light to deal significant damage, resulting in it rarely being used in action. The Boys was also inadequate in the anti-tank role. It was heavy, which meant that it was difficult for infantry to handle effectively, and was outdated; by 1940 it was effective only at short ranges, and then only against armoured cars and light tanks. In November 1941 during Operation Crusader, part of the North African Campaign, staff officers of the British Eighth Army were unable to find even a single instance of a Boys knocking out a German tank.

Due to these limits, a new infantry anti-tank weapon was required, and this ultimately came in the form of the Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank, commonly abbreviated to PIAT. The origins of the PIAT can be traced back as far as 1888, when an American engineer by the name of Charles Edward Munroe was experimenting with guncotton; he discovered that the explosive would yield a great deal more damage if there were a recess in it facing the target. This phenomenon is known as the &quot;Munroe effect&quot;. The German scientist Egon Neumann found that lining the recess with metal enhanced the damage dealt even more. By the 1930s Henry Mohaupt, a Swiss engineer, had developed this technology even further and created shaped charge ammunition. This consisted of a recessed metal cone placed into an explosive warhead; when the warhead hit its target, the explosive detonated and turned the cone into an extremely high-speed spike. The speed of the spike, and the immense pressure it caused on impact allowed it to create a small hole in armour plating and send a large pressure wave and large amounts of fragments into the interior of the target. It was this technology that was used in the No. 68 AT grenade.

Although the technology existed, it remained for British designers to develop a system that could deliver shaped charge ammunition in a larger size and with a greater range than that possessed by the No. 68. At the same time that Mohaupt was developing shaped charge ammunition, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker of the Royal Artillery was investigating the possibility of developing a lightweight platoon mortar. However, rather than using the conventional system of firing the mortar shell from a barrel fixed to a baseplate, Blacker wanted to use the spigot mortar system. Instead of a barrel, there was a steel rod known as a &quot;spigot&quot; fixed to a baseplate, and the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail. When the mortar was to be fired, the bomb was pushed down onto the spigot, which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air. By effectively putting the barrel on the inside of the weapon, the barrel diameter was no longer a limitation on the warhead size. Blacker eventually designed a lightweight mortar that he named the &quot;Arbalest&quot; and submitted it to the War Office, but it was turned down in favour of a Spanish design. Undeterred, however, Blacker continued with his experiments and decided to try to invent a hand-held anti-tank weapon based on the spigot design, but found that the spigot could not generate sufficient velocity needed to penetrate armour. But he did not abandon the design, and eventually came up with the Blacker Bombard, a swivelling spigot-style system that could launch a bomb approximately . Although the bombs it fired could not actually penetrate armour, they could still severely damage tanks, and in 1940 a large number of Blacker Bombards were issued to the Home Guard as anti-tank weapons.
When Blacker became aware of the existence of shaped charge ammunition, he realized that it was exactly the kind of ammunition he was looking for to develop a hand-held anti-tank weapon, as it depended upon the energy contained within itself, and not the sheer velocity at which it was fired. Blacker then developed a shaped charge bomb with a propellant charge in its tail, which fitted into a shoulder-fired launcher that consisted of a metal casing containing a large spring and a spigot; the bomb was placed into a trough at the front of the casing, and when the trigger was pulled the spigot rammed into the tail of the bomb and fired it out of the casing and up to approximately away. Blacker called the weapon the &quot;Baby Bombard&quot;, and presented it to the War Office in 1941. However, when the weapon was tested it proved to have a host of problems; a War Office report of June 1941 stated that the casing was flimsy and the spigot itself did not always fire when the trigger was pulled, and none of the bombs provided exploded upon contact with the target.

At the time that he developed the Baby Bombard and sent it off the War Office, Blacker was working for a government department known as MD1, which was given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerrilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe. Shortly after the trial of the Baby Bombard, Blacker was posted to other duties, and left the anti-tank weapon in the hands of a colleague in the department, Major Millis Jefferis.

Jefferis took the prototype Baby Bombard apart on the floor of his office in MD1 and rebuilt it, and then combined it with a shaped charge mortar bomb to create what he called the &quot;Jefferis Shoulder Gun&quot;. Jefferis then had a small number of prototype armour-piercing high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds made, and took the weapon to be tested at the Small Arms School at Bisley. A warrant officer took the Shoulder Gun down to a firing range, aimed it at an armoured target, and pulled the trigger; the Shoulder Gun pierced a hole in the target, but also wounded the warrant officer when a piece of metal from the exploding round flew back and hit him. Jefferis himself then took the place of the warrant officer and fired off several more rounds, all of which pierced the armoured target but without wounding him. Impressed with the weapon, the Ordnance Board of the Small Arms School had the faults with the ammunition corrected, renamed the Shoulder Gun as the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank, and ordered that it be issued to infantry units as a hand-held anti-tank weapon. Production of the PIAT began at the end of August 1942.

There was disagreement over the name to be given to the new weapon. A press report in 1944 gave credit for both the PIAT and the Blacker Bombard to Jefferis. Blacker took exception to this and suggested to Jefferis that they should divide any award equally after his expenses had been deducted. The Ministry of Supply had already paid Blacker £50,000 for his expenses in relation to the Bombard and PIAT. Churchill himself got involved in the argument; writing to the secretary of state for war in January 1943 he asked &quot;Why should the name &#x27;Jefferis shoulder gun&#x27; be changed to PIAT? Nobody objected to the Boys rifle, although that had a rather odd ring.&quot; Churchill supported Jefferis claims, but he did not get his way. For his part Blacker received £25,000 from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors.

==Design==

The PIAT was long and weighed , with an effective direct fire range of approximately and a maximum indirect fire range of . It could be carried and operated by one man, but was usually assigned to a two-man team, the second man acting as an ammunition carrier and loader. The body of the PIAT launcher was a tube constructed out of thin sheets of steel, containing the spigot mechanism, trigger mechanism and firing spring. At the front of the launcher was a small trough in which the bomb was placed, and the movable spigot ran along the axis of the launcher and into the trough. Padding for the user&#x27;s shoulder was fitted to the other end of the launcher, and rudimentary aperture sights were fitted on top for aiming; the bombs launched by the PIAT possessed hollow tubular tails, into which a small propellant cartridge was inserted, and shaped charge warheads.

Conventional spigot mortar designs have a fixed spigot rod, for example the Blacker Bombard. The moving spigot rod in the PIAT design was unusual, and served to help reduce recoil sufficiently to make it a viable shoulder fired weapon.

The PIAT was a little lighter by about and about shorter than its predecessor, the Boys anti-tank rifle, although it was heavier than the bazooka.
To prepare the weapon for firing the spigot mechanism, which was operated by a large spring, had to be cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then step on both sides of the shoulder padding (a la Pogo stick) and quarter-turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the spigot rod to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull the body of the weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger sear and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and quarter-turned to reattach it to the rest of the weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.

Note, however, that troops were trained to cock the PIAT before expected use, and &quot;in action the projector will always be carried cocked&quot; (but unloaded). Unless a stoppage occurred, it would not normally be necessary to manually re-cock the weapon in action.

When the trigger was pulled, the spring pushed the spigot rod (which has a fixed firing pin on the end) forwards into the bomb, which aligned the bomb, ignited the propellant cartridge in the bomb and launched it along the rod and into the air. The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant blew the spigot rod backwards onto the spring, similar to that of a blowback operation; this reduced the shock of recoil and automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to manually re-cock.

Tactical training emphasized that it was best used with surprise and concealment on the side of the PIAT team, and where possible enemy armoured vehicles should be engaged from the flank or rear. Due to the short engagement distances and the power of the bomb, the crew could be in the bomb blast zone so hard cover was desirable; on open training grounds this might be a slit trench. The PIAT was often also used in combat to knock out enemy positions located in houses and bunkers. It was possible to use the PIAT as an ad-hoc crude mortar by placing the shoulder pad of the weapon on the ground and supporting it.

Despite the difficulties in cocking and firing the weapon, it did have several advantages. The Spigot mortar design allowed a large calibre powerful shaped charge bomb giving greatly increased penetration power over the previous anti-tank rifles, allowing it to remain effective for the rest of the war; its construction was relatively simple and robust without a conventional barrel; there was no back-blast (unlike the contemporary American bazooka) that might endanger friendly troops and give the user&#x27;s position away, this also meant that the PIAT could be used in confined spaces as in urban warfare; compared to the previous anti-tank rifles the muzzle blast was minimal, also a potential concealment issue. However, the weapon did have drawbacks. It was very heavy and bulky, which meant that it was often unpopular with infantry required to carry it. There were also problems with early ammunition reliability and accuracy. Although the PIAT was theoretically able to penetrate approximately of armour, field experience during the Allied invasion of Sicily, which was substantiated by trials conducted during 1944, demonstrated that this capability was often nullified by problems of accuracy and round reliability. During these trials, a skilled user was unable to hit a target more than 60% of the time at , and faulty fuses meant that only 75% of the bombs fired detonated on-target.

==Ammunition and effect==
The PIATs&#x27; ammunition used the shaped charge principle, which, if the often unreliable early round design delivered it correctly to the target, allowed the warhead to penetrate almost all enemy armour types at close range.

The following ammunition types were available in 1943.
* Service bomb - &quot;Bomb, HE/AT&quot;
** Manual says green, but museum examples seem to be brown.
** AT shaped charge warhead design. Supplied with the propellant cartridge fitted and the fuse separate. 
** Versions:
*** Mark I, 1942, Nobels 808 plastic explosive filling, green band
*** Mark IA, reinforced central tube
*** Mark II, revised nose fuse
*** Mark III, revised nose fuse, TNT filling, blue band
*** Mark IV, July 1944, revised construction to reduce rearward fragmentation and &quot;back blast&quot; of warhead explosion.
** Also useful as a general-purpose HE blast type round
* Drill -&quot;Bomb, drill/AT&quot;
** Black, marked &quot;drill&quot;
** Same shape as a live round, for dry loading practice. Cannot be fired or dry fired.
* Practice bomb - &quot;Shot, practice/AT&quot;
** White
** Cylindrical thick steel construction, effectively a sub-calibre practice round. The PIAT requires a trough-like adapter to use it. Economical as it may be fired many times with new propellant cartridges. Trajectory slightly different to service bomb.
* Inert - &quot;Bomb, practice inert/AT&quot;
** Black, yellow ring, marked &quot;inert&quot;
** Same size and weight as a live round, no warhead, but has a live propellant cartridge. It can be fired once from a standard PIAT, it is not re-usable.

Rounds were supplied in three-round ammunition cases with the propellant cartridge fitted and the fuses separate.

Getting the bomb to detonate reliably against angled targets was troublesome and was addressed with revised fusing. See also the bazooka, which had similar early problems.

The 1943 manual simply describes the service bomb as &quot;H.E.&quot; or &quot;HE/AT&quot; and does not mention shaped charge as such. It notes that the bomb has &quot;Excellent penetration. The bomb can penetrate the armour of the latest known types of enemy A.F.Vs. and a considerable thickness of reinforced concrete&quot;. It also notes that it may be used &quot;as a house-breaker&quot;.

==Operational history==
===World War II===
The PIAT was used in all theatres in which British and other Commonwealth forces served.

It entered service in early-1943, and was first used in action in March near Majaz al Bab during the Tunisia Campaign. The 1944 war establishment for a British platoon, which contained 36 men, had a single PIAT attached to the platoon headquarters, alongside a mortar detachment. Three PIATs were issued to every company at the headquarters level for issuing at the CO discretion – allowing one weapon for each platoon. British Army and Royal Marines commandos were also issued with PIATs and used them in action.

In Australian Army service, the PIAT was also known as &quot;Projector Infantry Tank Attack&quot; (&quot;PITA&quot;). From 1943, one PIAT team was allocated to each infantry platoon in a jungle division – the tropical light infantry formation that was the standard front-line Australian division in the South West Pacific theatre. It was used against Japanese tanks, other vehicles and fortifications during the Borneo campaign of 1945.

A contemporary (1944–45) Canadian Army survey questioned 161 army officers, who had recently left combat, about the effectiveness of 31 different infantry weapons. In that survey the PIAT was ranked the most &quot;outstandingly effective&quot; weapon, followed by the Bren gun.

An analysis by British staff officers of the initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft. However, they also found that once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated shaped charge ammunition before it could penetrate the tank&#x27;s armour, the weapon became much less effective.

As part of the Anglo-Soviet Military Supplies Agreement, by 31 March 1946 the Soviet Union had been supplied with 1000 PIATs and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. The PIAT was also used by resistance groups in Occupied Europe. During the Warsaw Uprising, it was one of many weapons that Polish Underground resistance fighters used against German forces. In occupied France, the French resistance used the PIAT in the absence of mortars or artillery.
Six Victoria Crosses were awarded to members of the British and other Commonwealth armed forces for actions using the PIAT:
* On 16 May 1944, during the Italian Campaign, Fusilier Frank Jefferson used a PIAT to destroy a Panzer IV tank and repel a German counterattack launched against his unit as they assaulted a section of the Gustav Line.
* On 6 June 1944, Company Sergeant Major Stanley Hollis, in one of several actions that day, used a PIAT in an attack against a German field gun.
* On 12 June 1944 Rifleman Ganju Lama of the 7th Gurkha Rifles used a PIAT to knock out two Japanese tanks attacking his unit at Ningthoukhong, Manipur (given as Burma in the official citation). Despite sustaining injuries, Ganju Lama approached within of the enemy tanks, and having knocked them out moved on to attack the crews as they tried to escape. When asked by his Army Commander, William Slim, why he went so close, he replied he was not certain of hitting with a PIAT beyond .
* Between 19 and 25 September 1944, during the Battle of Arnhem, Major Robert Henry Cain used a PIAT to disable an assault gun that was advancing on his company position, and to force another three German Panzer IV tanks to retreat during a later assault.
* On the night of 21/22 October 1944, Private Ernest Alvia (&quot;Smokey&quot;) Smith used a PIAT to destroy a German Panther tank, one of three Panthers and two self-propelled guns attacking his small group. The self-propelled vehicles were also knocked out. He then used a Thompson submachine gun to kill or repel about 30 enemy soldiers. His actions secured a bridgehead on the Savio River in Italy.
* On 9 December 1944, while defending positions in Faenza, Italy, Captain John Henry Cound Brunt used a PIAT, amongst other weapons, to help repel an attack by the German 90th Panzergrenadier Division.

===After World War II===
The PIAT remained in service until the early 1950s, when it was replaced initially by the ENERGA anti-tank rifle grenade and then the American M20 &quot;Super Bazooka&quot;. The Australian Army briefly used PIATs at the start of the Korean War alongside bazookas, but quickly replaced both weapons with M20 &quot;Super Bazookas&quot;.
The Haganah and the emerging Israel Defence Force (IDF) used PIATs against Arab armour during the 1947–1949 Palestine war.

PIATs were also used by French and Việt Minh forces during the First Indochina War.

The Indian Army was still using PIATs by the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, they were used at the Battle of Longewala helping to halt the Pakistani armored division advance.

<doc id="238484" wikidata="Q2590533" url="?curid=238484" title="Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914 film)">
<text>Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance is a 1914 American silent comedy film directed by Mack Sennett and starring Marie Dressler, Mabel Normand, Charlie Chaplin, and the Keystone Cops. The picture is the first feature-length comedy and was the only feature-length comedy made by the Keystone Film Company.

At the time of production Marie Dressler was a major stage star, and in this film Chaplin and Normand support her as leads within Keystone&#x27;s stock company of actors.

The film, based on Dressler&#x27;s stage play &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; by A. Baldwin Sloane and Edgar Smith, is the first feature-length slapstick comedy in all of cinema.

This was the last time Charlie Chaplin acted in a film that he neither wrote nor directed. He plays a slightly different role from his Tramp character, which was relatively new at the time. However, he retains a moustache (here a pencil-thin &quot;dude&quot; type rather than his usual &quot;toothbrush&quot;), thin cane and distinctive walk.

&quot;Tillie&quot; provides an early example of film within a film, when the couple go to the cinema to watch &quot;A Thief&#x27;s Fate&quot;, large sections of which are seen.

==Plot==

Charles Chaplin portrays a womanizing city man who meets Tillie (Marie Dressler) in the country after a fight with his girlfriend (Mabel Normand). When he sees that Tillie&#x27;s father (Mack Swain) has a very large bankroll for his workers, he persuades her to elope with him. In the city, he meets the woman he was seeing already, and tries to work around the complication to steal Tillie&#x27;s money. He gets Tillie drunk in a restaurant and asks her to let him hold the pocketbook. Since she is drunk, she agrees, and he escapes with his old girlfriend and the money.

Later that day, they see a Keystone film in a nickelodeon entitled &quot;A Thief&#x27;s Fate&quot; (which is, ironically, a melodrama, a type of film Keystone did &quot;not&quot; produce) which illustrates their thievery in the form of a morality play. They both feel guilty and leave the theater. While sitting on a park bench, a paperboy (Gordon Griffith) asks him to buy a newspaper. He does so, and reads the story about Tillie&#x27;s Uncle Banks (Charles Bennett), a millionaire who died while on a mountain-climbing expedition. Tillie is named sole heir and inherits three million dollars. The man leaves his girlfriend on the park bench and runs to the restaurant, where Tillie is now forced to work to support herself as she is too embarrassed to go home. He begs her to take him back and although she is skeptical at first, she believes that he truly loves her and they marry. They move into the uncle&#x27;s mansion and throw a big party, which ends horribly when Tillie finds her husband with his old girlfriend, smuggled into the house and working as one of their maids.

The uncle is found on a mountaintop, alive after all. He goes back to his mansion, in disarray after Tillie instigated a gunfight (a direct result of the husband smuggling the old girlfriend into the house) which, luckily, did not harm anyone. Uncle Banks insists that Tillie be arrested for the damage she has caused to his house. The three run from the cops all the way to a dock, where a car &quot;bumps&quot; Tillie into the water. She flails about, hoping to be rescued. She is eventually pulled to safety, and both Tillie and the man&#x27;s girlfriend realize that they are too good for him. He leaves, and the two girls become friends.

==Production==
Mack Sennett, whilst working with a degree of autonomy, was working for the larger company of Kessel and Baumann.

When slapstick impresario Mack Sennett proposed to adapt the 1910 Broadway comedy &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; to the screen in 1914, he enlisted the immensely successful star of the stage production, the then 45-year-old Marie Dressler, to play the guileless ingenue, Tillie Banks. Dressler was paid a huge fee of £2500 per week and was also meant to have a share of the profits of Kessler and Baumann but they passed the distribution contract to Alco, voiding Dressler&#x27;s contract with K &amp; B and forcing Dressler to sue them. The situation was further complicated by Alco going bust, mainly due to overpaying for the distribution rights: £100,000. Chaplin&#x27;s salary was far less than Dressler, certainly under $1000 a week, as he demanded an increase to $1000 a week early in 1915.

Comedian Charles Chaplin, who had been with Sennett&#x27;s studio since December 1913, was selected to play opposite Dressler as Charlie, an unscrupulous playboy and bounder. Though Chaplin&#x27;s signature &quot;The Tramp&quot; character was already well-developed in other Sennett one- and two-reel films (he had already appeared in more than 30 shorts as the Tramp by the time), here he abandons the sweet-natured hobo to play a villain. The contrast between the diminutive, &quot;bow-legged&quot; Chaplin and the bovine and &quot;bulky&quot; Dressler, adds to the absurdity of their pairing.

Sennett&#x27;s augmentation of the film length from two reels to six reels provided him with sufficient scope to showcase his ensemble of talented players in numerous venues:

The film, which costs roughly $50,000 ($1.2 million in 2015) to make, was based on the Broadway play &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, which Dressler had great success in, on Broadway, and on tour in the United States, from 1910 to 1912. Dressler would revive the play with her own touring company.

Milton Berle always claimed that he played the five-year-old paperboy in the film. but the role was actually portrayed by Gordon Griffith.

This is one of only two films (the other is &quot;Making a Living&quot;, his first film, where he also plays a &quot;dude&quot; non-Tramp character) in which both Chaplin and the Keystone Cops appear.

==Reception==
Following its December 21, 1914 premiere at the Los Angeles Republic Theatre, the film was a tremendous success. As the Mutual Film Corporation, distributors of all Keystone shorts, was not equipped to handle features from them, &quot;Tillie&quot; became the only Keystone production to be distributed by the newly formed (and short-lived) Alco Film Corporation. It remained in theatrical release for years, being continually re-edited and shortened, and much later having optical soundtracks added featuring music, sound effects and narration.

==Home media==
For decades the film was only available in poor quality, truncated prints, but eventually David Shepard of Film Preservation Associates released his restoration on LaserDisc (1997) and DVD (1999) via Image Entertainment. It was coupled with &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Married Life&quot; (1914), another Keystone film featuring Normand, Chaplin and Swain. In 2003 a second restoration, a collaboration between UCLA Film and Television Archive and the British Film Institute, used more complete, higher quality materials and saw &quot;Tillie&quot; returned almost to its original length. This version has been released in the fully restored &quot;Chaplin at Keystone&quot; 4-DVD box set (2010) by various labels worldwide.

==Sequels==
Dressler appeared as Tillie in three more films, &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Tomato Surprise&quot; (1915), &quot;Tillie Wakes Up&quot; (1917), and &quot;The Scrub Lady&quot; (1917), aka &quot;Tillie the Scrub Lady&quot;.

In &quot;Tillie Wakes Up&quot;, the Tillie character is married and so has a different surname.

===The 1928 film===
Another comedy called &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; was released in 1928 starring W. C. Fields as a circus ringmaster. Although often erroneously cited as a remake, the later film actually bears no resemblance to the 1914 film aside from the shared title and that Chester Conklin and Mack Swain appear in both films.

===In popular culture===
In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;American History X-cellent&quot;, one of Mr. Burns&#x27; belongings includes a ticket stub for &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot;.

<doc id="238486" wikidata="Q4741868" url="?curid=238486" title="Ambrose Shea">
<text>Sir Ambrose Shea (17 September 1815 – 30 July 1905) was a political and business figure in colonial Newfoundland who later served as Governor of the Bahamas. He was one of two Newfoundland delegates to the Quebec Conference that led to Canadian Confederation.

==Early life==
Shea was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland Colony, the fifth son of Henry Shea and Eleanor Ryan. His father had emigrated from County Tipperary, Ireland.

== Business career ==
Ambrose Shea worked for a time on &quot;The Newfoundlander&quot;, a family-owned newspaper, before going into business for himself. By the 1850s, he was a successful merchant who also dealt in insurance, and acted as the agent for the transatlantic steamer trade. He continued to operate the business during most of his political career.

In addition, he helped found the Newfoundland Natives Society in 1840, serving on the management committee in 1842, and as president in 1846.

== Political career ==
Although he had been suggested as a candidate for the Newfoundland House of Assembly in 1842, Shea declined a nomination. In 1848, he ran and won as a Liberal member for Placentia-St. Mary&#x27;s and supported the campaign for responsible government. He was also the party&#x27;s spokesman on reciprocity with the United States and was a delegate to negotiations in Washington in 1853.

In the first responsible government election in 1855, Shea was elected to the House of Assembly from St. John&#x27;s West, and was appointed Speaker.

However, tensions soon arose between those members who were immigrants to Newfoundland, and those, including Shea, who were born there. There were also difficulties between Shea and Prime Minister John Kent, who took office in 1858. Despite the conflicts, the Liberals retained power after the 1859 election. Shea won elected from Burin and remained Speaker after the election. He was absent much of the time from the fall session of 1860, and many believed that he was organizing a covert campaign against Kent.

When the Kent government collapsed, and Hugh Hoyles was invited to form a minority Conservative government in 1861, Shea was offered a cabinet post but declined. In the election held that year, Shea was elected in Placentia. The Liberals were soundly defeated. After Kent&#x27;s departure, Shea became party leader.

When the invitation to the Quebec Conference arrived in 1864, Shea acted as one of two delegates, along with F. B. T. Carter. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Quebec Resolutions, giving a speech in their favour at a dinner in Montreal. Upon his return to Newfoundland, however, he found that his enthusiasm was not shared by much of the population. Once again, Shea found himself in the minority of political opinion during debates on the subject in 1865.
As one of the few Catholic supporters of the idea, Shea was invited to join a coalition cabinet under Carter. However, his presence there drew much criticism and provoked many anti-Confederation attacks, to the point where he was unable to sway even Catholic opinion in favour of union. His plan to promote union by employing Newfoundlanders on the construction of the Intercolonial Railway (ICR) was unsuccessful, as many men either failed find work on the line, or drifted away without returning to the island.

In the 1869 election, Shea was forced to campaign in Placentia against Charles Fox Bennett, the anti-Confederation leader, and an electorate strongly opposed to union. He and Carter&#x27;s pro-union coalition government were defeated.

Following the defeat, Shea avoided public life for a time, but by 1873 was ready to run again. Although he was defeated in St. John&#x27;s East that year, he was returned unopposed in Harbour Grace in January 1874. When Carter re-assumed the premiership after the fall of the Bennett government in 1873, Shea remained in the Assembly, wielding considerable influence in the Executive Council although he was not a member.

Shea was one of the primary supporters of railway construction, and was a member of the joint committee that recommended establishment of a line in 1880. He fought the 1885 election as leader of the Liberal Party, quietly negotiating with members of the new Reform Party to ensure a Reform victory, and laying the groundwork for a future coalition.

Although Shea retained his seat in the 1882 election, he began campaigning for employment with the British imperial government. After receiving a knighthood in 1883, he began expressing his desire to become governor of Newfoundland. Previous government service had given him a favourable standing with the Colonial Office, which indicated to Shea that his services would be properly rewarded. However, he found himself in competition with Carter for the same position.

Although the Colonial Office initially decided to appoint Shea, it was forced to withdraw his name in the face of protests organized by Carter. The experience soured Shea&#x27;s opinion of Newfoundland and its government.

Despite efforts to placate Shea, many in the Newfoundland government felt he was an embarrassment, and wished to see him employed elsewhere. When the governorship of the Bahamas became available, it was agreed to give Shea the position. He served there from October 1887 to December 1894, and was by all accounts a popular and respected figure.

However, he maintained an interest in Newfoundland&#x27;s affairs, even attempting to participate in the 1888 Confederation negotiations (though his efforts were ignored). He also seemingly never lost his desire for the Newfoundland governorship. As late as 1894, he was still campaigning for appointment to the post. After his term as governor of the Bahamas ended, Shea retired to London.

==Personal life==

Shea married first wife, Isabella Nixon in New York City in 1851.

In 1878, he married second wife Louisa Bouchette Hart in Quebec City. Hart was the daughter of Joseph Bouchette, Deputy Surveyor-General of Lower Canada, and granddaughter of Colonel Joseph Bouchette, topographer. Hart was a widow who had been previously married, in 1851, to Alexander Hart.
== Death and legacy ==
Shea died in 1905 in London. His body was repatriated to St John&#x27;s where it lay in state in the Legislative Council before a state funeral.

Sir Ambrose Shea was the naming basis for the lift bridge in Placentia which helps transport pedestrians and boats through the passage of water separating the communities of Placentia and Jerseyside. There have been two iterations of the Sir Ambrose Shea Lift Bridge, the first being built in 1961 after the MV &quot; Ambrose Shea&quot; ferry service had been in service for a number of years. The second bridge was finished in 2016, and stands tall as a big tourist attraction in Placentia.

<doc id="238487" wikidata="Q2705072" url="?curid=238487" title="Federal Election Commission">
<text>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent agency of the United States government that enforces U.S. campaign finance laws and oversees U.S. federal elections. Created in 1974 through amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act, the commission describes its duties as &quot;to disclose campaign finance information, to enforce the provisions of the law such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions, and to oversee the public funding of Presidential elections.&quot; It is led by six commissioners who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

The commission was unable to function from late August 2019 to December 2020, with an exception for the period of May 2020 to July 2020, due to lack of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the commission could not vote on complaints or give guidance through advisory opinions. As of May 19, 2020, there were 350 outstanding matters on the agency&#x27;s enforcement docket and 227 items waiting for action. In December 2020, three commissioners were appointed to restore a quorum; however, deadlocks arising from the equal number of members from the Republican and Democratic parties with the absence of a tie-breaking vote has resulted in some controversial investigations not being pursued.

== History and membership ==

=== History ===
The FEC was established in 1974, in an amendment of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), to enforce and regulate campaign finance law. Initially, its six members were to be appointed by both houses of Congress and the president, reflecting a strong desire for Congress to retain control. Two commissioners were to be appointed by the president pro tempore of the Senate and two by the speaker of the House of Representatives, each upon recommendation by the respective majority and minority leaders in that chamber, and the last two appointed by the president. They were to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress, rather than only by the Senate.

The appointment process was invalidated in 1976, in &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot;, when the Supreme Court held that the commissioners of the FEC were &quot;Officers of the United States&quot; under the Appointments Clause, and must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Congress then amended the FECA to comply with &quot;Buckley&quot; and now the six FEC commissioners are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

Since 1990, the FEC has grown more polarized, with considerable deadlocks in decision-making.

=== Commissioners ===
The commission consists of six commissioners appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Each commissioner is appointed for a six-year term, but each ending on April 30. Two commissioners are appointed every two years. However, commissioners continue to serve after their terms would expire until a replacement is confirmed, but may resign at any time. By law, no more than three commissioners can be members of the same political party.

The commission had fewer than six commissioners for several years after the resignation of Ann Ravel (Democratic) in March 2017. President Donald Trump nominated James E. Trainor III (Republican) on September 14, 2017, for a term expiring on April 30, 2023, to enable replacement for Lee Goodman (Republican), who resigned in February 2018, creating a second vacancy. When Matthew Petersen (Republican) resigned on August 31, 2019, the commission had only three commissioners, and was unable to conduct most of its regulatory and decision-making functions due to lack of a quorum.

Trainor was confirmed by the Senate on May 19, 2020, restoring the commission&#x27;s quorum of four. One meeting was held online, due to the coronavirus pandemic, on June 18, 2020. On June 25, however, Caroline Hunter (Republican) resigned, effective July 3, with the result that the commission once again lacked a quorum. On December 9, three new members were confirmed by the Senate.

The chair of the commission rotates among the commissioners each year, with no commissioner serving as chair more than once during a six-year term. However, a commissioner may serve as chair more than once if they serve beyond the six-year mark and no successor is appointed; for example, Ellen L. Weintraub (Democratic) was chair in 2003, 2013, 2019, and 2025. President Donald Trump purportedly fired Weintraub on February 6, 2025; Weintraub has rejected the action, arguing that her removal was unlawful and &quot;ultra vires&quot;. The chair of the commission in 2022 was Allen Dickerson, who was elected in December 2021, succeeding Shana Broussard.

== Official duties ==
=== Duties ===
The FEC administers federal campaign finance laws. It enforces limitations and prohibitions on contributions and expenditures, administers the reporting system for campaign finance disclosure, investigates and prosecutes violations (investigations are typically initiated by complaints from other candidates, parties, watchdog groups, and the public), audits a limited number of campaigns and organizations for compliance, and administers the presidential public funding programs for presidential candidates.

Until 2014, the FEC was also responsible for regulating the nomination of conventions and defends the statute in challenges to federal election laws and regulations.

The FEC also publishes reports, filed in the Senate, House of Representatives and presidential campaigns, that list how much each campaign has raised and spent, and a list of all donors over $200, along with each donor&#x27;s home address, employer and job title. This database also goes back to 1980. Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, information about individual contributors taken from FEC reports cannot be sold or used for soliciting political or charitable contributions, or for any commercial purpose. This restriction applies only to the use of individual contributor information, and does not apply to candidate committees, party committees, or political action committees. The FEC authorizes reporting committees to include up to ten fictitious records as a means to detect data misuse. The FEC also maintains an active program of public education, directed primarily to explaining the law to the candidates, their campaigns, political parties and other political committees that it regulates.

=== Procedures and deadlock ===
The most significant powers of the FEC require an affirmative vote. These powers include the ability to conduct investigations, report misconduct to law enforcement, pursue settlements with candidates, and to bring a civil action in court to enforce campaign finance regulations. The FEC can also publish advisory opinions on campaign finance issues and issue campaign finance regulations.

Under the statute, there is an even number of commissioners with no more than three commissioners being members of the same political party. However, there is no tie-breaking process, such as by the chair. In addition, there is a quorum requirement of four commissioners. This results in four of the six commissioners being required for a FEC decision, which in turn means that on controversial issues bipartisan support is required for a decision. Critics have argued that the even number of commissioners and the supermajority requirement was a &quot;set up for deadlock and political shenanigans,&quot; especially in an age of polarization.

Between 1996 and 2006, the FEC tied in only 2.4% of Matters Under Review (MURs). In 2008 and 2009, such deadlocks spiked to 13% and to 24.4% in 2014. By 2016, commissioners deadlocked on more than 30% of substantive votes and consequently enforcement intensity decreased significantly.

== Criticism ==
===Campaign finance===
Critics of the FEC, including many former commissioners and campaign finance reform supporters, have harshly complained of the FEC&#x27;s impotence, and accused it of succumbing to regulatory capture where it serves the interests of the ones it was intended to regulate. The FEC&#x27;s bipartisan structure, which was established by Congress, renders the agency &quot;toothless.&quot; Critics also claim that most FEC penalties for violating election law come well after the actual election in which they were committed. Additionally, some critics claim that the commissioners tend to act as an arm of the &quot;regulated community&quot; of parties, interest groups, and politicians when issuing rulings and writing regulations. Others point out, however, that the commissioners rarely divide evenly along partisan lines, and that the response time problem may be endemic to the enforcement procedures established by Congress. To complete steps necessary to resolve a complaint – including time for defendants to respond to the complaint, time to investigate and engage in legal analysis, and finally, where warranted, prosecution – necessarily takes far longer than the comparatively brief period of a political campaign.

While campaigning in the 2018 United States House of Representatives elections in New York, Democratic primary candidate Liuba Grechen Shirley used campaign funds to pay a caregiver for her two young children. The FEC ruled that federal candidates can use campaign funds to pay for childcare costs that result from time spent running for office. Grechen Shirley became the first woman in history to receive approval to spend campaign funds on childcare.

===First Amendment issues===

Critics including former FEC chairman Bradley Smith and Stephen M. Hoersting, former executive director of the Center for Competitive Politics, criticize the FEC for pursuing overly aggressive enforcement theories that they believe amount to an infringement on the First Amendment right to free speech.

Division over the issue became especially prominent during the last several years of the Obama administration. Commissioners deadlocked on several votes over whether to regulate Twitter, Facebook, and other online mediums for political speech, as well as a vote to punish Fox News for the selection criteria it used in a presidential debate.

===Deadlocks===

Critics of the commission also argue that the membership structure regularly causes deadlocks on 3-3 votes. Since 2008, 3-3 votes have become more common at the FEC. From 2008 to August 2014, the FEC has had over 200 tie votes, accounting for approximately 14 percent of all votes in enforcement matters.

On May 6, 2021, the FEC closed an inquiry into whether the payment to Stormy Daniels by Donald Trump violated campaign financial law during the 2016 election. The FEC voted 2-2, between Democrats and Republicans, against a motion to take further action. Republican Vice Chairman Allen Dickerson recused himself, while independent Commissioner Steven Walther did not vote.

Similarly, in June 2021, the FEC found that &quot;National Enquirer&quot; violated US election laws and $150,000 paid by AMI to Karen McDougal amounted to an illegal campaign contribution. Publisher AMI agreed to a fine of $187,500. However, the FEC divided 3-3 on party lines on a motion to pursue further investigation into Donald Trump, thus closing the investigation.

In June 2023, the FEC deadlocked over requests to create guidelines for campaign advertisements which use content generated by artificial intelligence. The vote failed 3-3 with all Republican commissioners voting against the request and all Democratic commissioners voting in favor, with Republican commissioner Allen Dickerson arguing that the agency did not have the authority to regulate such advertisements.&quot;

<text>James Montgomery Flagg (June 18, 1877 – May 27, 1960) was an American artist, comics artist, and illustrator. He worked in media ranging from fine art painting to cartooning, but is best remembered for his political posters, particularly his 1917 poster of Uncle Sam created for United States Army recruitment during World War I.
==Life and career==
Flagg was born on June 18, 1877, in Pelham, New York. He was enthusiastic about drawing from a young age, and had illustrations accepted by national magazines by the age of 12. By 14, he was a contributing artist for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and the following year was on the staff of another magazine, &quot;Judge&quot;.

From 1894 through 1898, he attended the Art Students League of New York. He studied fine art in London and Paris from 1898 to 1900, after which he returned to the United States, where he produced countless illustrations for books, magazine covers, political and humorous cartoons, advertising, and spot drawings. Among his creations was a comic strip that appeared regularly in &quot;Judge&quot; from 1903 until 1907, about a tramp character titled Nervy Nat.

In 1915, he accepted commissions from Calkins and Holden to create advertisements for Edison Photo and Adler Rochester Overcoats but only on the condition that his name would not be associated with the campaign.

He created his most famous work in 1917, a poster to encourage recruitment in the United States Army during World War I. It showed Uncle Sam pointing at the viewer (inspired by a 1914 British recruitment poster showing Lord Kitchener in a similar pose) with the caption &quot;I Want YOU for U.S. Army&quot;. Flagg had first created the image for the July 6, 1916, cover of &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot; with the headline &quot;What Are You Doing for Preparedness?&quot; Over four million copies of the poster were printed during World War I, and it was revived for World War II. Flagg used his own face for that of Uncle Sam (adding age and the white goatee), he said later, simply to avoid the trouble of arranging for a model. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt praised his resourcefulness for using his own face as the model. Flagg had a neighbor, Walter Botts, pose as a model for the strong shoulders, and thrusting forefinger of the piece.

In 1917, he also attended the Illustrators&#x27; Ball, one of many annual masquerade balls in Manhattan, New York. The artists-only event was held in the 1845-built Hotel Brevoort in Greenwich Village, a neighborhood where many artists and cartoonists lived at the time. That year, the theme was &quot;Kaleidoscopic Ball,&quot; with no specific requirements for costumes. Flagg dressed as the Scottish sailor Captain William Kidd.

At his peak, Flagg was reported to have been the highest-paid magazine illustrator in America. He worked for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, which were two of the most popular U.S. journals. In 1946, Flagg published his autobiography, &quot;Roses and Buckshot&quot;. Apart from his work as an illustrator, Flagg painted portraits which reveal the influence of John Singer Sargent. Flagg&#x27;s sitters included Mark Twain and Ethel Barrymore; his portrait of Jack Dempsey now hangs in the Great Hall of the National Portrait Gallery. In 1948, he appeared in a Pabst Blue Ribbon magazine ad which featured the illustrator working at an easel in his New York studio with a young lady standing at his side and a tray with an open bottle of Pabst and two filled glasses sat before them.

Toward the end of his life, when deteriorating eyesight forced him to give up his art, &quot;he often took out his frustrations on his friends and himself.&quot; He died on May 27, 1960, in New York City. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==
Fort Knox, Kentucky, has a parade field named for and dedicated to Flagg. It is called Flagg Field and located behind the Fort Knox Hotel. Fort Knox is also the home of U.S. Army Recruiting Command, which borders Flagg Field.

Flagg spent summers in Biddeford Pool, Maine, and his home, the James Montgomery Flagg House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

<doc id="238493" wikidata="Q4686717" url="?curid=238493" title="Adverse pressure gradient">
<text>In fluid dynamics, an adverse pressure gradient is a pressure gradient in which the static pressure increases in the direction of the flow. Mathematically this is expressed as for a flow in the positive -direction. 

This is important for boundary layers. Increasing the fluid pressure is akin to increasing the potential energy of the fluid, leading to a reduced kinetic energy and a deceleration of the fluid. Since the fluid in the inner part of the boundary layer is slower, it is more greatly affected by the increasing pressure gradient. For a large enough pressure increase, this fluid may slow to zero velocity or even become reversed causing a flow separation. This has very significant consequences in aerodynamics since flow separation significantly modifies the pressure distribution along the surface and hence the lift and drag characteristics.

Turbulent boundary layers tend to be able to sustain an adverse pressure gradient better than an equivalent laminar boundary layer. The more efficient mixing which occurs in a turbulent boundary layer transports kinetic energy from the edge of the boundary layer to the low-momentum flow at the solid surface, often preventing the separation that would occur for a laminar boundary layer under the same conditions. This physical fact has led to a variety of schemes to actually produce turbulent boundary layers when boundary layer separation is dominant at high Reynolds numbers; the dimples on a golf ball, the fuzz on a tennis ball, or the seams on a baseball are good examples. Aeroplane wings are often engineered with vortex generators on the upper surface to produce a turbulent boundary layer.

<doc id="238495" wikidata="Q289263" url="?curid=238495" title="Étienne-Paschal Taché">
<text>Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché (5 September 1795 – 30 July 1865) was a Canadian medical doctor, politician, and Father of Confederation. His family had a long history in New France, but suffered serious financial reverses due to the Seven Years&#x27; War and the siege of Quebec. He was considered a self-made man, who became a physician, a militia soldier, and a politician. He served twice as joint premier of the Province of Canada.

Taché was a strong supporter of the Confederation of the British North American provinces, and the maintenance of the British connection. From June 1864, he was the formal head of the Great Coalition which pushed for Confederation, containing John A. Macdonald, George-Étienne Cartier and George Brown, but he died in office in 1865, two years before Confederation and the creation of Canada.

== Early life and family ==
Taché was born in St. Thomas, Lower Canada (now Montmagny, Quebec) in 1795, the third son of Charles Taché and Geneviève Michon. The Taché family had been wealthy prior to the Conquest. Taché&#x27;s grandfather, Jean Taché, was a Paris merchant who emigrated to New France in 1730 and became one of the leading merchants and ship-owners in Quebec City. Jean Taché also married well; his wife was Marie-Anne Jolliet de Mingan, the granddaughter of the explorer Louis Jolliet. However, the family fortunes were badly damaged by the Seven Years&#x27; War and the siege of Quebec. The Taché family was of the seigneurial class, but the traditional seigneury did not provide much income for the family. As a result, in light of his successes in life, Étienne-Paschal Taché was considered to be a self-made man.

Alexandre Antonin Taché, who entered the priesthood and became Archbishop of St. Boniface in Manitoba, was his nephew.

==Military service==
Taché studied at the Petit Séminaire de Québec until the War of 1812. Although still a teenager, he left school and joined the 5th Battalion of the Select Embodied Militia of the Lower Canada militia as an ensign. He was later promoted to lieutenant and fought in the Chasseurs Canadiens. He was present at two key battles, the Battle of the Châteauguay, which saved Montreal from being occupied by the invading American forces, and the Battle of Plattsburgh, which ended the British attempt to invade the United States via Lake Champlain.

After the battle, there were conflicting claims for the credit of the victory, by the Governor General, the general commanding British North American troops, and Lieutenant Colonel de Salaberry. A pseudonymous letter appeared shortly afterwards in the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; by a &quot;témoin oculaire&quot; (&quot;eye-witness&quot;) stating that the victory had been won by de Salaberry&#x27;s leadership. Several years after the battle, Taché stated that he knew that the letter had been written by Michael O&#x27;Sullivan, aide-de-camp to de Salaberry, who had been in the heat of the battle. The letter is important contemporary evidence concerning the battle, and Taché&#x27;s statement was significant for confirming its authenticity.

Taché retained a life-long interest in military affairs, which he relied upon during his political career. He rose to the rank of colonel in the Canadian militia, and was appointed an honorary colonel in the British Army.

==Medical career==

In his spare time in military camps during the war, Taché started medical studies. After the war, he took further instruction under a well-known physician in Lower Canada, Pierre de Sales Laterrière, and then continued his studies at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He obtained his medical licence in Lower Canada in 1819 and started to practise medicine in Montmagny.

The next year, on 18 July 1820, Taché married Sophie Baucher, &quot;dit&quot; Morency, in Quebec City; they had 15 children. For the next twenty years, he developed a thriving practice on the south shore of the St. Lawrence, acquiring a significant social standing which later helped his political career.

When Taché was first admitted to the practice of medicine, British doctors in Lower Canada had a monopoly over admission to the medical profession. By 1831, he was a member of the Quebec Medical Society when it acquired the right to elect the members of the boards of examiners in Quebec City and Montreal, ending the monopoly of the British doctors. Taché was elected to the Quebec City board of examiners, which for the first time had a large number of &quot;Canadien&quot; doctors.

==Political career==

===&quot;Patriote&quot; movement===

Taché was at the heart of the &quot;Patriote movement&quot; in Montmagny. In 1836, he attended a major meeting of the &quot;Patriotes&quot; in Trois-Rivières, where they set out their grievances with British rule in Lower Canada. In 1837, he organised a &quot;Patriote&quot; meeting at Montmagny, attended by &quot;Patriote&quot; leaders such as Louis-Joseph Papineau, Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine, Jean-Joseph Girouard, and Augustin-Norbert Morin, who came &quot;to fire the zeal&quot; of the &quot;Patriotes&quot; in the area.

Taché did not support armed rebellion, but he nonetheless gave shelter to Morin at one point during the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1837. There was also a deposition by one informant in 1838, in the aftermath of the Rebellion, that Taché was active in the Frères chasseurs in the Kamouraska area, and might be planning to try to seize the lower River Saint-Lawrence. Hearing rumours of Taché&#x27;s activities, the British authorities issued a search warrant for his house in January 1839. Taché was absent when the search occurred. No firearms were found and he was not arrested. Although Taché did not support armed rebellion, neither did he condemn those who took up arms. In his view, they were only a few hundred men who were driven to despair by the actions of the British government.

===Province of Canada===

Following the rebellion in Lower Canada, and the similar rebellion in 1837 in Upper Canada (now Ontario), the British government decided to merge the two provinces into a single province, as recommended by Lord Durham in the Durham Report. The &quot;Union Act, 1840&quot;, passed by the British Parliament, abolished the two provinces and their separate parliaments, and created the Province of Canada, with a single parliament for the entire province, composed of an elected Legislative Assembly and an appointed Legislative Council. 
The Governor General retained a strong position in the government.

Taché now embarked on a political career. Closing down his medical practice, he was a candidate in the 1841 general election for the new Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. Campaigning against the union of the Canadas, he was unopposed in the constituency of L&#x27;Islet and was elected by acclamation. When the first Parliament was summoned, Taché was a member of the French-Canadian Group. He voted against the principle of the union, opposed the policies of Governor-General Lord Sydenham, and generally voted in favour of the reform proposals of La Fontaine and Robert Baldwin, particularly responsible government.

He held numerous posts in successive administrations, including, for a time, joint-premier of the province (1856–1857, 1864–1865) as well as Minister of Militia and Defence for the Province of Canada (1855 to 1860).

===Father of Confederation===
Taché actively participated in the debate on the potential creation of a Canadian confederation, defended proposals for the new form of government in part because it would serve to reaffirm Canada&#x27;s link to the British Empire. At the Confederation Debates, he stated that &quot;Confederation was imperative if Canadians &#x27;desired to remain British and monarchical, and ... desired to pass our children these advantages. These ideas reflected the ideas of the conservative Parti bleu (with which Taché was associated).

An avid supporter of the British Crown, Taché expressed ideas of loyalty even before the debates regarding the creation of Canada&#x27;s confederation: &quot;in 1848, he delivered his famous idea of French-Canadian loyalty to the British crown: ... &#x27;we will never forget our allegiance till the last cannon which is shot on this continent in defence of Great Britain is fired by the hand of a French-Canadian. This can certainly explain why Taché worked with future Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and other significant characters who were Fathers of the Confederation and who shared similar views. Therefore, these alliances led to the Great Coalition of 1864 – &#x27;a government led by Cartier, Brown and Macdonald under the premiership of a bleu elder statesman, Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché&#x27; - responsible for the Canadian Confederation. For this matter, Taché presided of over the Quebec City conference of 1864.

Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché&#x27;s loyalty was officially recognized as an &quot;aide-de-camp to [ Queen Victoria ], [and] held the honorary rank of a Colonel in the army&quot;. When Edward, Prince of Wales, toured British North America in 1860, Taché was specially attached to the Prince&#x27;s staff.

==Death and legacy==

Taché died at age 69 in Montmagny, and is buried there at St. Odilon Cemetery, where a marker from the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board marks his grave. A monument to him stands at 141 Taché Boulevard East in Montmagny.

He left an important legacy, not only regarding the formation of Canada, but also to the province of Quebec&#x27;s heritage: &quot;Taché is widely credited with coining the provincial motto of Quebec, later adopted by the French-speaking Royal 22nd Regiment [...]: (&#x27;I remember&#x27;).&quot;

== Honours and recognition==
*1858: knighted by Queen Victoria
*1860: appointed honorary colonel in the British Army and aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria
*1862: appointed to the Order of St. Gregory the Great

<text>Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley (May 8, 1818June 25, 1896) was a Canadian politician and one of the Fathers of Confederation. Tilley was descended from United Empire Loyalists on both sides of his family. As a pharmacist, he went into business as a druggist.

== Early life ==
Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley was born in Gagetown, New Brunswick, on May 8, 1818, to a storekeeper named Thomas Morgan Tilley, and Susan Ann Peters, both of whom had descended from American loyalists.

== Political career ==
Samuel Leonard Tilley entered politics as an activist in the temperance movement. As a result of the 1848 recession, caused in part by Britain&#x27;s economic policies, he became an advocate for responsible government. Tilley later joined the New Brunswick Colonial Association, which advocated for the colony&#x27;s own control over its public expenses, the establishment of a public school system, government control of public works, and &quot;honest government&quot; in general.

First elected to the New Brunswick Assembly as a Liberal in 1850, he sat in opposition until the 1854 election swept the reformers to power. Tilley became Provincial Secretary in the government of Charles Fisher. In 1855 he persuaded the assembly to pass a prohibition law, but that proved a failure and was later repealed.

He attended each of the Charlottetown, London, and Quebec City Conferences as a supporter of Canadian Confederation. He served as premier of the colony of New Brunswick from 1861 until his government was defeated in the election of 1865. As premier, he supported the New Brunswick&#x27;s entry into Confederation and the construction of an intercolonial railway.

A common tale states that Tilley was the originator of the word &quot;Dominion&quot; in Canada&#x27;s name. The Fathers of Confederation had been discussing what to prefix Canada with, Kingdom of Canada being Macdonald&#x27;s preference. During morning devotions, in St Andrew&#x27;s in the backyard of his cousin, Dr Samuel Tilley GOVE, (the editor&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, who also has the Psalter used by Tilley), before the two of them headed down the street to Church, Tilley read Psalm 72:8, which states &quot;He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth&quot;, and presented this inspiration to the others, being as their ambition was to stretch the new nation to the Pacific Ocean and from the St Lawrence River to the North Pole. &quot;Dominion&quot; had been used before, but Tilley pushed hard for it to be adopted in reference to Canada, despite Macdonald&#x27;s preference.

The term led to the naming of the July 1 national holiday; however, the reference to a unique Canadian historical development was discarded in 1982 when &quot;Canada Day&quot;, which had already been in use by most Canadians, was made official by an act of Parliament. In French, the date had long been known as &quot;la fête nationale&quot; (national feast or national birthday), a date which is often now applied to June 24 in Quebec, a date officially known as Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day.

Tilley entered federal politics with Confederation in 1867 and served in the federal cabinet as Minister of Customs. He became Minister of Finance in 1873 and served until the defeat of the government later that year. He was appointed the fourth Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick in 1873 and served until 1878. When Macdonald&#x27;s Tories returned to power in 1878, Tilley was elected member for Saint John and again became minister of finance; while in that office he introduced protective tariffs which became the basis of Canadian financial policy. He served in cabinet until his retirement from politics in 1885, when he was again appointed the seventh Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick.

The Sir Leonard Tilley Building was named in his honour.
He is interred in the Fernhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick.

==Personal life==
On May 6, 1843, Tilley married Julia Ann Hanford in Saint John, New Brunswick; they had eight children. Hanford died in 1862, leaving Tilley a widower. On October 22, 1867, he married Alice Starr Chipman in St. Stephen, New Brunswick; they had two children, including future New Brunswick Premier Leonard Percy de Wolfe Tilley. Samuel Leonard Tilley died in 1896 on June 25.

Tilley, then-Minister of Customs, married his second wife on October 20, 1867. Alice Starr Chipman was the daughter of ship owner (The Cedars) Zachariah Chipman and his wife Mary Eliza. The couple had two sons Herbert Chipman Tilley, born September 6, 1868, and Leonard Percy DeWolfe Tilley, born May 21, 1870. In July 1884, he and his wife were presented to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, at Osborne, by the Princess Louise. The couple were activists in the temperance movement. During the 13 years the couple lived at Government House, Fredericton no intoxicants were in use at their entertainments. Alice was instrumental in the founding of the Victoria College Hospital at Fredericton, New Brunswick. She helped found the Industrial School for Boys, the Nurses`Home, the Seamen&#x27;s Mission and the Home for Consumptives at Saint John, New Brunswick. The Chipman homestead in St. Stephen, New Brunswick was donated by the heirs of the estate in 1902 to found the Chipman Memorial Hospital. Alice was a founding member of the National Council of Women and served as President of the St John Local Council of Women.

<doc id="238507" wikidata="Q319432" url="?curid=238507" title="Bazooka">
<text>The Bazooka () is a man-portable recoilless anti-tank rocket launcher weapon, widely deployed by the United States Army, especially during World War II. Also referred to as the &quot;stovepipe&quot;, the innovative Bazooka was among the first generation of rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat. Featuring a solid-propellant rocket for propulsion, it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shaped charge warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The universally applied nickname arose from the weapon&#x27;s M1 variant&#x27;s vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a &quot;bazooka&quot; invented and popularized by 1930s American comedian Bob Burns.

During World War II, the German armed forces captured several bazookas in early North African and Eastern Front encounters and soon reverse engineered their own version, increasing the warhead diameter to 8.8 cm (among other minor changes) and widely issuing it as the &quot;Raketenpanzerbüchse&quot; &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; (&quot;rocket anti-armor rifle &#x27;tank terror). Near the end of the war, the Japanese developed a similar weapon, the Type 4 70 mm AT rocket launcher, which featured a rocket-propelled grenade of a different design. During the Korean War, the M1 and M9 Bazooka series was replaced by the larger caliber M20 Super Bazooka.

The term &quot;bazooka&quot; still sees informal use as a generic term referring to any shoulder fired ground-to-ground/ground-to-air missile weapon (mainly rocket-propelled grenade launchers or recoilless rifles), and as an expression that &quot;heavy measures&quot; are being taken.

==Name==
The name &quot;bazooka&quot; comes from an extension of the word &quot;bazoo&quot;, which is slang for &quot;mouth&quot; or &quot;boastful talk&quot;, and which probably stems from the Dutch &quot;bazuin&quot; (buisine, a medieval trumpet).&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline/bazooka&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;bazooka&quot; appears in the 1909 novel &quot;The Swoop, or how Clarence Saved England&quot; by P. G. Wodehouse, describing the character Grand Duke Vodkakoff and a musical instrument used in music halls: &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t &#x27;arf wonder, from the look of him, if he wasn&#x27;t the &#x27;aughty kind of a feller who&#x27;d cleave you to the bazooka for tuppence with his bloomin&#x27; falchion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg/7050&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, &quot;bazooka&quot; became the universally applied nickname of the new American anti-tank weapon, due to its vague resemblance to the musical instrument invented and popularized by 1930s American comedian Bob Burns.

Shortly after the first prototype launcher and rockets had been tested by firing into the Potomac River, U.S. Army colonel Leslie Skinner, and Lieutenant Colonel Edward Uhl took the new system to a competitive trial of various types of spigot mortar (at that time seen as the most promising way to deliver a shaped charge), which was held at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The new rocket launcher scored several hits on a moving tank while the five different mortars achieved none; this was a considerable achievement since the launcher&#x27;s sights had been fabricated that morning from a wire coat hanger bent with a broken nail. The trial was being watched by various senior officers, among them the chief of research and engineering in the Ordnance Department, Major General Gladeon M. Barnes. Barnes was delighted by the performance of the system and fired it himself, but commented: &quot;It sure looks like Bob Burns&#x27; bazooka&quot;.

==History==

===Design and development===
The development of the Bazooka involved the development of two specific lines of technology: the rocket-powered weapon and the shaped charge warhead. It was also designed for easy maneuverability and access.

====World War I====
This rocket-powered weapon was the brainchild of Robert H. Goddard as a side project (under U.S. Army contract during World War I) of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his tenure at Clark University, and while working at Worcester Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s magnetic lab and Mount Wilson Observatory (for security reasons), designed a tube-fired rocket for military use. He and his co-worker Clarence N. Hickman successfully demonstrated his rocket to the U.S. Army Signal Corps at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, on November 6, 1918, but as the Compiègne Armistice was signed only five days later, development was discontinued. The project was also interrupted by Goddard&#x27;s serious bout with tuberculosis. He continued to be a part-time consultant to the U.S. government at Indian Head, Maryland, until 1923, but turned his focus to other projects involving rocket propulsion. Hickman completed the development of the Bazooka after becoming head of the National Defense Research Committee in the 1940s, where he guided rocket development for the war effort.

====Shaped charge development====
Shaped charge technology was developed in the U.S. into a shaped charge anti-tank grenade for use by infantry, effective at defeating up to 60 mm (2.4 in) of vehicle armor. The grenade was standardized as the M10. However, the M10 grenade weighed 3.5 lb (1.6 kg), proving difficult to throw by hand and too heavy to be launched as a rifle grenade. The only practical way to use the weapon was for an infantryman to place it directly on the tank, a dangerous and unlikely means of delivery in most combat situations. A smaller, less powerful, version of the M10, the M9, was then developed, which could be fired from a rifle. This resulted in the creation of a series of rifle grenade launchers, the M1 (Springfield M1903), the M2 (Enfield M1917), the M7 (M1 Garand), and the M8 (M1 carbine). However, a truly capable anti-tank weapon had yet to be found, and following the lead of other countries at the time, the U.S. Army prepared to evaluate competing designs for a more effective man-portable anti-tank weapon. The combination of rocket motor and shaped charge warhead led to the Army&#x27;s development of light antitank weapons.

====Rocket-borne shaped charge weapons development====
In 1942, U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Skinner received the M10 shaped-charge grenade which was capable of stopping German tanks. He gave Lieutenant Edward Uhl the task of creating a delivery system for the grenade. Uhl created a small rocket, but needed to protect the operator from the rocket motor&#x27;s exhaust. According to Uhl:

At the launcher&#x27;s first firing test, Uhl wore a welding helmet, but discovered that there was not enough exhaust from the rocket to require protective equipment. The prototype launcher was demonstrated in May 1942 at a competitive trial of various types of spigot mortars at Aberdeen Proving Ground. On the morning of the trial Skinner and Uhl realised that the launcher had no sights, so they improvised some from a wire coathanger; despite this, it was the only weapon in the trial to be able to hit a moving tank. This led to the launcher being demonstrated to General George C. Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, who ordered 5,000 units on the spot. By late 1942, the improved &quot;Rocket launcher, M1A1&quot; was introduced. The forward hand grip was deleted, and the design simplified. The production M1A1 was 55 inches (1.37 m) long and weighed 12.75 pounds (5.8 kg).

The ammunition for the original M1 launcher was the M6 (&quot;trials&quot; code: T1), which was notoriously unreliable. The M6 was improved and designated &quot;M6A1&quot;, and the new ammunition was issued with the improved M1A1 launcher. After the M6, several alternative warheads were introduced. Many older M1 launchers were modified to M1A1 standards in July and August 1943. Batches of M6 rockets designated &quot;M6A2&quot; were overhauled with the latest ignition systems and had been modified to be able to be fired from the upgraded M1 launchers. The M6A3 rocket featured a blunt, rounded nose to lessen the chances of it ricocheting off angled armor. The M6A3 was meant to be fired from the M9, and later M9A1, launchers. Late in World War II, the M6A4 and M6A5 rockets with improved fuses were developed. These rockets arrived too late to see service during the war, but were used post-war.

The 2.36 inch (60 mm) smoke rocket M10 and its improved subvariants (M10A1, M10A2, M10A4) used the rocket motor and fin assembly of the M6A1, but replaced the anti-tank warhead with a white phosphorus (WP) smoke head. WP smoke not only acts as a visibility screen, but its burning particles can cause severe injuries to skin. The M10 was therefore used to mark targets, to blind enemy gunners or vehicle drivers, or to drive troops out of bunkers and dugouts. The 2.36-inch incendiary rocket T31 was an M10 variant with an incendiary warhead designed to ignite fires in enemy-held structures and unarmored vehicles, or to destroy combustible supplies, ammunition, and materiel; it was not often utilized.

The original M1 and M1A1 rocket launchers were equipped with simple fixed sights and used launch tubes without reinforcements. During the war, the M1A1 received a number of running modifications. The battery specification was changed to a larger, standard battery cell size, resulting in complaints of batteries getting stuck in the wood shoulder rest (the compartment was later reamed out to accommodate the larger cells). The M1 and M1A1 used rear iron sights and front rectangular &quot;ladder&quot; sights positioned at the muzzles. The vertical sides of the ladder sight were inscribed with graduations of 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards, with the user elevating the Bazooka so the rear sight lined up with the selected &quot;rung&quot; on the front sight. On the M9, the ladder sight was replaced by the General Electric T43 aperture sight. Ranging was accomplished by looking through the rear sight&#x27;s peep hole while rotating the assembly (which had graduations of 100, 200, and 300 yards) so it lined up with the blade positioned at the muzzle. In September 1944, during the production of the M9A1, the T43 sight was replaced by the Polaroid T90 optical reflector sight, which used an etched reticle for aiming. The T43 and T90 sights were interchangeable. Various types of blast deflectors were tried, and an additional strap iron shoulder brace was fitted to the M9 launcher.

The Bazooka required special care when used in tropical or arctic climates or in severe dust or sand conditions. Rockets were not to be fired at temperatures below 0 °F or above 120 °F (−18 °C to +49 °C).

====Field experience-induced changes====
In 1943, field reports of rockets sticking and prematurely detonating in M1A1 launch tubes were received by Army Ordnance at Ogden Arsenal and other production facilities. At the U.S. Army&#x27;s Aberdeen Proving Grounds, various metal collars and wire wrapping were used on the sheet metal launch tube in an effort to reinforce it. However, reports of premature detonation continued until the development of bore slug test gauges to ensure that the rocket did not catch inside the launch tube.

The original M6 and M6A1 rockets used in the M1 and M1A1 launchers had pointed noses, which were found to cause deflection from the target at low impact angles. In late 1943, another 2.36-in rocket type was adopted, the M6A3, for use with the newly standardized M9 rocket launcher. The M6A3 was 19.4 inches (493 mm) long, and weighed 3.38 lb (1.53 kg). It had a blunted, more round nose to improve target effect at low angles, and a new circular fin assembly to improve flight stability. The M6A3 was capable of penetrating of armor plate.

Battery problems in the early Bazookas eventually resulted in replacement of the battery-powered ignition system with a magneto sparker system operated through the trigger. A trigger safety was incorporated into the design that isolated the magneto, preventing misfires that could occur when the trigger was released and the stored charge prematurely fired the rocket. The final major change was the division of the launch tube into two discrete sections, with bayonet-joint attachments. This was done to make the weapon more convenient to carry, particularly for use by airborne forces. The final two-piece launcher was standardized as the M9A1. In September 1944, the fragile folding aperture sight was replaced by a Polaroid optical reflector sight. However, the long list of incorporated modifications increased the launcher&#x27;s tube length to 61 inches (1.55 m), with an overall empty weight of 14.3 lb (6.5 kg). From its original conception as a relatively light, handy, and disposable weapon, the final M9A1 launcher had become a heavy, clumsy, and relatively complex piece of equipment.

In October 1944, after receiving reports of inadequate combat effect of the M1A1 and M9 launchers and their M6A1 rockets, and after examining captured examples of the German 8.8 cm RPzB 43 and RPzB 54 Panzerschreck, the U.S. Ordnance Corps began development on a new, more powerful anti-tank rocket launcher, the 3.5-inch (90 mm) M20. However, the weapon&#x27;s design was not completed until after the war and saw no action against an enemy until the Korean War.

In 1945, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Service standardized improved chemical warfare rockets intended for the new M9 and M9A1 launchers, the Army adopted the M26 gas rocket, a cyanogen chloride (CK)-filled warhead for the 2.36-in rocket launcher. CK, a deadly blood agent, was capable of penetrating the protective filter barriers in some gas masks, and was seen as an effective agent against Japanese forces (particularly those hiding in caves or bunkers), whose gas masks lacked the impregnants that would provide protection against the chemical reaction of CK. While stockpiled in US inventory, the CK rocket was never deployed or issued to combat personnel.

====Aviation use====
Following Operation Overlord in 1944, the military version of the slow-flying Piper J-3 Cub high-wing civilian monoplane, the L-4 Grasshopper, began to be used in a light anti-armor role by a few U.S. Army artillery spotter units over France; these aircraft were field-outfitted with either two or four Bazookas attached to the lift struts, against German armored fighting vehicles.
Upon arriving in France in 1944, U.S. Army major, Charles Carpenter, an Army aviator flying liaison and artillery-spotting lightplanes like the military version of the Piper J-3 Cub, the L-4 Grasshopper, was issued a new L-4H version during the concluding stages of &quot;Overlord&quot;, taking this &quot;light attack&quot; role against German armor by himself. With a 150-pound pilot and no radio aboard, the L-4H had a combined cargo and passenger weight capacity of approximately 232 pounds. This margin allowed him to eventually mount a total of six Bazookas, three per side on the lift struts as other L-4s had done.

Within a few weeks, Carpenter was credited with knocking out a German armored car and four tanks. Carpenter&#x27;s plane was known as &quot;Rosie the Rocketer&quot;, and his exploits were soon featured in many press accounts, including &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, the Associated Press, &quot;Popular Science&quot;, &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, and &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine. Carpenter once told a reporter that his idea of fighting a war was to &quot;attack, attack and then attack again&quot;. During the critical late-September Battle of Arracourt, Carpenter managed to achieve disabling hits on several German armored cars and two Panther tanks, along with killing or wounding a dozen or more enemy soldiers. 

In the opening months of the Korean War, in August 1950, a joint U.S. Navy and Marine Corps test used a newly acquired Bell HTL-4 helicopter to test if a Bazooka could be fired from a helicopter in flight. One of the larger, 3.5 inch, models of the Bazooka was chosen, and was mounted ahead and to the right of the helicopter to allow the door to remain clear. The Bazooka was successfully tested, although it was discovered that it would require shielding for the engine compartment, which was exposed in the model 47 and other early helicopters. The helicopter itself belonged to HMX-1, a marine experimental helicopter squadron.

===Operational use===

====World War II====
In September 1942, a consignment of 600 M1 Bazookas was shipped to Egypt for use by the British Army in the Western Desert campaign. In a demonstration to British commanders, a Bazooka penetrated the frontal armor of a captured Panzer III; however it was decided that the desert terrain lacked the concealment required for such a short range weapon and it was not deployed in that theater. In November 1942 during Operation Torch, early production versions of the M1 launcher and M6 rocket were hastily supplied to some of the U.S. invasion forces during the landings in North Africa. On the night before the landings, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was shocked to discover from a subordinate that none of his troops had received any instruction in the use of the Bazooka.

Initially supplied with the highly unreliable M6 rocket and without training for its operators, the M1 did not play a significant armed role in combat in the North African fighting, but did provide a German intelligence coup when some were captured by the Germans in early encounters with inexperienced U.S. troops. A U.S. general visiting the Tunisian front in 1943 after the close of combat operations could not find any soldiers who could report that the weapon had actually stopped an enemy tank. Further issue of the Bazooka was suspended in May 1943.

During the Allied invasion of Sicily, small numbers of the M1A1 Bazooka (using an improved rocket, the M6A1) were used in combat by U.S. forces. The M1A1 accounted for four medium German tanks and a heavy Tiger I, with the latter being knocked out by an improbable hit through the driver&#x27;s vision slot.

When the existence of the Bazooka was revealed to the American public, official press releases for the first two years stated that it &quot;packed the wallop of a 155 mm cannon&quot;—a great exaggeration.

In late 1942, numbers of early-production American M1 Bazookas were captured by German troops from Red Army forces who had been given quantities of the Bazooka under lend-lease. There were also examples captured during the Operation Torch invasions in the North African Campaign. The Germans promptly developed their own version of the weapon called the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot;, increasing the diameter of the warhead from 60 mm to 88 mm (2.4 to 3.5 in), which as a result, gave it significantly greater armor penetration. During U.S. trials of the M1, calls for a larger-diameter warhead had also been raised by some ordnance officers but were rejected. Later in the war, after participating in an armor penetration test involving a German Panther tank using both the &quot;Raketenpanzerbüchse&quot;, or RPzB 54 &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; and the U.S. M9 Bazooka, Corporal Donald E. Lewis of the U.S. Army informed his superiors that the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; was &quot;far superior to the American Bazooka&quot;: &#x27;I was so favorably impressed [by the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot;] I was ready to take after the Krauts with their own weapon.&#x27;
The M1 Bazooka fared much better on the rare occasions when it could be used against the much thinner armor typically fitted to the lower sides, undersides, and tops of enemy tanks. To hit the bottom of an enemy tank, the Bazooka operator had to wait until the tank was surmounting a steep hill or other obstruction, while hitting the top armor usually necessitated firing the rocket from the upper story of a building or a similar, elevated, position. Even the heavy King Tiger tank only possessed hull and turret top armor of 44 mm ( in) thickness at best, able to be pierced by the Bazooka&#x27;s shaped-charge rocket. During the 1944 Allied offensive in France, when some examples of liaison aircraft with the U.S. Army began to be experimentally field-armed, and were already flying with pairs or quartets of the American ordnance—and most notably used during the Battle of Arracourt—Major Charles &quot;Bazooka Charlie&quot; Carpenter mounted a battery of three M9 Bazookas on the wing-to-fuselage struts on each side of his L-4 Grasshopper aircraft to attack enemy armor, and was credited with destroying six enemy tanks, including two Tiger I heavy tanks. In the hands of American infantry the Bazooka still enjoyed rare successes against heavy Nazi armored fighting vehicles. In 1945, during the failed Operation Nordwind offensive, a Bazooka team managed the unlikely achievement of destroying a Jagdtiger heavy tank destroyer, the most heavily armored fighting vehicle in World War Two. The team managed to do this by positioning themselves to get a shot at the massive vehicle&#x27;s thinner side armor, scoring a direct hit on the ammunition bustle and causing a catastrophic kill. This incident shows that when correctly aimed at vulnerable points on vehicles the Bazooka could still be effective against even the largest of armored vehicles, though it required significant skill to accomplish.

In a letter dated May 20, 1944, General George S. Patton stated to a colleague that &quot;the purpose of the Bazooka is not to hunt tanks offensively, but to be used as a last resort in keeping tanks from overrunning infantry. To insure this, the range should be held to around 30 yards.&quot;

In the Pacific campaign, as in North Africa, the original Bazookas sent to combat often had reliability issues. The battery-operated firing circuit was easily damaged during rough handling, and the rocket motors often failed because of high temperatures and exposure to moisture, salt air, or humidity. With the introduction of the M1A1 and its more reliable rocket ammunition, the Bazooka was effective against some fixed Japanese infantry emplacements such as small concrete bunkers and pillboxes. Against coconut and sand emplacements, the weapon was not always effective, as these softer structures often reduced the force of the warhead&#x27;s impact enough to prevent detonation of the explosive charge. Later in the Pacific war, Army and Marine units often used the M2 flamethrower to attack such emplacements. In the few instances in the Pacific where the Bazooka was used against tanks and armored vehicles, the rocket&#x27;s warhead easily penetrated the thin armor plate used by the Japanese and destroyed the vehicle. Overall, the M1A1, M9, and M9A1 rocket launchers were viewed as useful and effective weapons during World War II, though they had been primarily employed against enemy emplacements and fixed fortifications, not as anti-tank weapons. General Dwight Eisenhower later described it as one of the four &quot;tools of victory&quot; which won World War II for the Allies (together with the atom bomb, Jeep and the C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft).

During the war, Bazookas were lend-leased to the United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada, China, and Free French forces as well as the Soviet Union. Some were supplied to French &quot;maquis&quot; and Yugoslav partisans.

====Korean War====

The success of the more powerful German &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; caused the Bazooka to be completely redesigned at the close of World War II. A larger, 3.5 in (89 mm) model was adopted, the M20 &quot;Super Bazooka&quot;. Though bearing a superficial resemblance to the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot;, the M20 had a greater effective range, penetrating capability and was nearly 20% lighter than its German counterpart. The M20 weighed 14.3 pounds (6.5 kg) and fired a hollow shaped-charge 9 lb (4 kg) M28A2 HEAT rocket when used in an anti-tank role. It was also operated by a two-man team and had a rate of fire of six shots per minute. As with its predecessor, the M20 could also fire rockets with either practice (M29A2) or WP smoke (T127E3/M30) warheads. Having learned from experience of the sensitivity of the Bazooka and its ammunition to moisture and harsh environments, the ammunition for the new weapon was packaged in moisture-resistant packaging, and the M20&#x27;s field manual contained extensive instructions on launcher lubrication and maintenance, as well as storage of rocket ammunition. When prepared for shipment from the arsenal, the weapon was protected by antifungal coatings over all electrical contacts, in addition to a cosmoline coating in the hand-operated magneto that ignited the rocket. Upon issue, these coatings were removed with solvent to ready the M20 for actual firing. However, budget cutbacks initiated by Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson in the years following World War II effectively canceled the intended widespread issue of the M20, and initial U.S. forces deploying to Korea were armed solely with the M9/M9A1 2.36-in. launcher and old stockpiled World War II inventories of M6A3 rocket ammunition.

At the outbreak of the Korean War, the South Korean military had 1,958 M9A1 rocket launchers that were given from the U.S. Forces Korea during withdrawal in 1948 to 1949, and they were the only anti-tank firearms that the Korean military had secured in sufficient quantities. The South Korean military actively operated rocket launchers against North Korean armor. However, the 2.36-inch rocket launcher failed to show its power against the front armor of T-34-85, which was the biggest threat. The South Korean military responded by firing rockets into the side, rear, or track through ambushes, but they did not have much effect.

At the same time, the U.S. military dispatched its first troops to the Korean Peninsula without trusting reports that a 2.36-inch rocket could not destroy North Korean tanks. On July 5, 1950, during the Battle of Osan, Task Force Smith tried to stop North Korean tanks with 2.36-inch rocket launchers and 75 mm recoilless rifles but was overrun by 33 T-34-85s. One of the North Korean T-34s received a total of 22 shots on the side and rear at about 10 meters in distance, but survived the attack.

On July 8, Colonel Robert R. Martin, commander of the 34th Regiment of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, was killed while operating a 2.36-inch rocket launcher to prevent North Korean tanks from advancing. Additionally, ordnance authorities received numerous combat reports regarding the failure of the M6A3 warhead to properly detonate upon impact, eventually traced to inventories of rocket ammunition that had deteriorated from numerous years of storage in humid or salt air environments. Therefore, the U.S. Army immediately airlifted a small number of available M20 Super Bazookas from the U.S. mainland after learning that it needed more powerful rockets. The rockets were deployed during the Battle of Taejon on July 18, and proved their power by destroying a number of North Korean tanks that entered the city on July 20. As a result, the U.S. Army rushed to secure more M20 rockets and was able to hold more than 900 Super Bazookas during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. The South Korean military also began receiving the M20 in early August, and successfully destroyed four tanks with M20s during their first usage on 9 August.

Large numbers of 2.36-inch bazookas that were captured during the Chinese Civil War were also employed by the Chinese forces against the American Sherman and Patton tanks, and the Chinese later reverse engineered and produced a copy of the M20 designated the &quot;Type 51&quot;. It is considered that the Communist-used bazookas destroyed more tanks than the UN Bazookas did.

====Vietnam War====
The M20 was used in the early stages of the war in Vietnam by the U.S. Marines before gradually being phased out by the mid-1960s in favor of the M67 recoilless rifle and later, the M72 LAW rocket. The U.S. Army also used it in lesser quantity. While occasions to destroy enemy armored vehicles proved exceedingly rare, it was employed against enemy fortifications and emplacements with success. The M20 remained in service with South Vietnamese and indigenous forces until the late 1960s.

The Vietnam People&#x27;s Army also developed their own Bazooka under the management of Tran Dai Nghia. It was successfully test-fired in 1947. The anti-French Viet Minh received Chinese Type 51 bazookas. They were used by the Viet Cong as late as 1964.

====Other conflicts====
The Portuguese Armed Forces used quantities of M9A1 and M20 rocket launchers in their overseas provinces in Africa against Marxist guerrilla forces during the Portuguese Overseas War. The French Army also used the M9A1 and M20A1 launchers in various campaigns in Indochina, Korea, and Algeria. The M20A1 was replaced in the 1970s by the LRAC F1. Commonwealth armies also used the M20 and M20A1 under the name M20 Mk I and M20 Mk II. They were used until their replacement by the Carl Gustav L14A1. For instance, British Army used Super Bazookas during the Operation Vantage. The Argentine Army fielded M20s during the Falklands War.

* M20B1 upgraded with M20A1 improvements

===Rocket launcher, M25 &quot;Three-shot Bazooka&quot;===
* Experimental tripod mounted rocket launcher with overhead magazine circa 1955

===RL-83 Blindicide===

* RL-83 Blindicide: An improved &quot;bazooka&quot; design of Belgian origin. Used by Belgian forces during the Congo Crisis and by the Swiss, Mexican and Israeli armies and various other armed forces.
* The Blindicide is not a direct derivative of the M20 design, being smaller caliber (83 mm not 88.9 mm). The aluminum launch tube is externally reinforced with glass reinforced plastic. 
* The launch tube can be folded to just over half the opened length which makes it far easier to carry into combat
* The Blindicide rocket has another major difference from the &quot;super bazooka&quot; in that it is mechanically fired with a percussion cap system, the launcher having a simple mechanical hammer with a firing pin, that is cocked by the loader. There are two safety levers, one on the aimer&#x27;s pistol grip, and another at the rear of the launch tube for the protection of the loader. 
* Because no electrical connection had to be made between rocket and launcher, reload time is faster than for the &quot;super bazooka&quot; and a good team can fire off six rockets per minute.
* Blindicide rockets were designed to spin in flight, with six of the rocket&#x27;s exhaust ports being angled to impart spin. While spinning the rocket has improved accuracy, centrifugal forces acting on the explosive jet tend to spread the jet, reducing the thickness of armor that it can penetrate.

===3.5 in Hydroar M20A1B1 rocket launcher===
* Brazil, manufactured by Hydroar SA—improved 3.5 M20A1B1. A hand grip with solid state firing circuit powered by two AA cells replaced the U.S.-designed hand grip with magneto trigger.

===88.9 mm Instalaza M65===
* Developed by Instalaza for use by the Spanish Army, the M65 is an improved version of the M20 &quot;super bazooka&quot;. It uses an improved ignition method and new ammunition types. The available ammunitions used were the CHM65 (HEAT), MB66 (dual-purpose), and FIM66 (smoke) shells. Older versions were designated M53 and M58.

<doc id="238508" wikidata="Q215281" url="?curid=238508" title="Lead(II) nitrate">
<text>Lead(II) nitrate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Pb(NO3)2. It commonly occurs as a colourless crystal or white powder and, unlike most other lead(II) salts, is soluble in water.

Known since the Middle Ages by the name plumbum dulce, the production of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid was small-scale, for direct use in making other lead compounds. In the nineteenth century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States. Historically, the main use was as a raw material in the production of pigments for lead paints, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide. Other industrial uses included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate has begun to be used in gold cyanidation.

Lead(II) nitrate is toxic and must be handled with care to prevent inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Due to its hazardous nature, the limited applications of lead(II) nitrate are under constant scrutiny.

== History ==

Lead nitrate was first identified in 1597 by the alchemist Andreas Libavius, who called the substance &quot;plumbum dulce&quot;, meaning &quot;sweet lead&quot;, because of its taste. It is produced commercially by reaction of metallic lead with concentrated nitric acid in which it is sparingly soluble. It has been produced as a raw material for making pigments such as chrome yellow (lead(II) chromate, PbCrO4) and chrome orange (basic lead(II) chromate, Pb2CrO5) and Naples yellow. These pigments were used for dyeing and printing calico and other textiles. It has been used as an oxidizer in black powder and together with lead azide in special explosives.

== Production ==

Lead nitrate is produced by reaction of lead(II) oxide with concentrated nitric acid: 
: PbO + 2 HNO3 (concentrated) → Pb(NO3)2↓ + H2O
It may also be obtained by evaporation of the solution obtained by reacting metallic lead with dilute nitric acid. 
: Pb + 4 HNO3 → Pb(NO3)2 + 2 NO2 + 2 H2O

Solutions and crystals of lead(II) nitrate are formed in the processing of lead–bismuth wastes from lead refineries.

== Structure ==
The crystal structure of solid lead(II) nitrate has been determined by neutron diffraction. The compound crystallizes in the cubic system with the lead atoms in a face-centred cubic system. Its space group is Pa3Z=4 (Bravais lattice notation), with each side of the cube with length 784 picometres.

The black dots represent the lead atoms, the white dots the nitrate groups 27 picometres above the plane of the lead atoms, and the blue dots the nitrate groups the same distance below this plane. In this configuration, every lead atom is bonded to twelve oxygen atoms (bond length: 281 pm). All N–O bond lengths are identical, at 127 picometres.

Research interest in the crystal structure of lead(II) nitrate was partly based on the possibility of free internal rotation of the nitrate groups within the crystal lattice at elevated temperatures, but this did not materialise.

== Chemical properties and reactions==
Lead nitrate is an oxidizer and has been used as such in pyrotechnics . It is soluble in water and dilute nitric acid.

Basic nitrates are formed when alkali is added to a solution. is the predominant species formed at low pH. At higher pH is formed. The cation is unusual in having an oxide ion inside a cluster of 3 face-sharing tetrahedra.
There is no evidence for the formation of the hydroxide, , in aqueous solution below pH 12.

Solutions of lead nitrate can be used to form co-ordination complexes. Lead(II) is a hard acceptor; it forms stronger complexes with nitrogen and oxygen electron-donating ligands. For example, combining lead nitrate and pentaethylene glycol (shortened to EO5 in the referenced paper) in a solution of acetonitrile and methanol followed by slow evaporation produced the compound [EO5]. In the crystal structure for this compound, the EO5 chain is wrapped around the lead ion in an equatorial plane similar to that of a crown ether. The two bidentate nitrate ligands are in trans configuration. The total coordination number is 10, with the lead ion in a bicapped square antiprism molecular geometry.

The complex formed by lead nitrate with a bithiazole bidentate N-donor ligand is binuclear. The crystal structure shows that the nitrate group forms a bridge between two lead atoms. One aspect of this type of complexes is the presence of a physical gap in the coordination sphere; i.e., the ligands are not placed symmetrically around the metal ion. This is potentially due to a lone pair of lead electrons, also found in lead complexes with an imidazole ligand.

== Applications ==

Lead nitrate has been used as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.

Heating lead nitrate is convenient means of making nitrogen dioxide:

:&lt;chem&gt;2 Pb(NO_3)_2-&gt;[\Delta]2PbO + 4NO_2 +O_2 &lt;/chem&gt;

In the gold cyanidation process, addition of lead(II) nitrate solution improves the leaching process. Only limited amounts (10 to 100 milligrams lead nitrate per kilogram gold) are required.

In organic chemistry, it may be used in the preparation of isothiocyanates from dithiocarbamates. Its use as a bromide scavenger during SN1 substitution has been reported.

== Safety ==
Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and ingestion may lead to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as probably carcinogenic to humans (Category 2A). They have been linked to renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, brain cancer and lung cancer in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known to substitute for zinc in a number of enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.

<text>Domrémy-la-Pucelle (, ; ) is a commune in the Vosges department in Grand Est in northeastern France.

The village, originally named Domrémy, is the birthplace of Joan of Arc. It has since been renamed &quot;Domrémy-la-Pucelle&quot; after Joan&#x27;s nickname, (&quot;the Maid of Orléans&quot;).

==Geography==
Domrémy is positioned along the Upper Meuse Valley, north of the town of Coussey. The village land includes a small wooded hill to the west of the houses, which rises to a height of 407 metres (1335&#x27;), known as the Domrémy Wood. This overlooks the small adjacent settlement of Les Roises.

==History==
Domrémy and Greux were exempted from taxes &quot;forever&quot; by Charles VII in 1429. It was the sole request made of the king by Joan of Arc when Charles asked her how he could show her his appreciation for seeing him crowned; Joan felt that taxes burdened the villagers. Moreover, he wished to do a good deed for her success in fighting the English during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Taxes were imposed upon Domrémy and Greux again during the French Revolution; the residents have paid taxes since.

Until 1766, Domrémy was part of the Duchy of Bar (within a section of the duchy which owed fealty to the Crown of France although the other half of the duchy was part of the Holy Roman Empire). In that year, the Duchy, part of which had become a fief of the Kingdom of France in 1301, escheated to the crown fully upon the death of its last duke, Stanisław Leszczyński.

<doc id="238512" wikidata="Q313430" url="?curid=238512" title="Bartholomew Roberts">
<text>Bartholomew Roberts (17 May 1682 – 10 February 1722), born John Roberts, was a Welsh pirate who was, measured by vessels captured, the most successful pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy. During his piratical career, he took over 400 prize ships, although most were mere fishing boats. Roberts raided ships off the Americas and the West African coast between 1719 and 1722; he is also noted for creating his own pirate code, and adopting an early variant of the Skull and Crossbones flag.

Roberts&#x27;s infamy and success saw him become known as &quot;The Great Pyrate&quot; and eventually as Black Bart (), and made him a popular subject for writers of both fiction and non-fiction. To this day, Roberts continues to feature in popular culture, and has inspired fictional characters (such as the Dread Pirate Roberts).

== Early life ==
He was born John Roberts in 1682 in Casnewydd Bach, between Fishguard and Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, Wales. His father was most likely George Roberts. It is unclear why Roberts changed his name from John to Bartholomew, but pirates often adopted aliases. He may have chosen his first name after the well-known buccaneer Bartholomew Sharp. He was thought to have gone to sea when he was 13 in 1695, but there is no further record of him until 1718, when he was mate of a Barbados sloop.

In 1719, Roberts was second mate on the slave ship &quot;Princess&quot; under Captain Abraham Plumb. In early June that year, the &quot;Princess&quot; was anchored at Anomabu (then spelled Annamaboa, which is situated along the Gold Coast of West Africa, present-day Ghana) when she was captured by pirates. The pirates were in two vessels, &quot;Royal Rover&quot; and &quot;Royal James,&quot; and were led by captain Howell Davis. Davis, like Roberts, was a Welshman, originally from Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire. Roberts and several other of the crew of the &quot;Princess&quot; were forced to join the pirates.

Davis quickly discovered Roberts&#x27; abilities as a navigator and took to consulting him. He was also able to confide information to Roberts in the Welsh language, thereby keeping it hidden from the English and international crewmen. Roberts is said to have been reluctant to become a pirate at first, but quickly came to see the advantages of this new lifestyle and saw it as a great opportunity for him. Captain Charles Johnson reports him as saying:
== Life as a pirate ==
=== Commander or commoner ===
In the merchant navy, Roberts&#x27; wage was less than £4 per month () and he had no chance of promotion to captaincy.

A few weeks after Roberts&#x27; capture, &quot;Royal James&quot; had to be abandoned because of worm damage. &quot;Royal Rover&quot; headed for the island of Príncipe. Davis hoisted the flags of a British man-of-war and was allowed to enter the harbor. After a few days, Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, and he was invited to call at the fort for a glass of wine first. The Portuguese had discovered that their visitors were pirates. They ambushed Davis&#x27; party on its way to the fort, shooting Davis dead.

A new captain had to be elected. Davis&#x27; crew was divided into &quot;Lords&quot; and &quot;Commons&quot;, and it was the &quot;Lords&quot; who had the right to propose a name to the remainder of the crew. Within six weeks of his capture, Roberts was elected captain. This was unusual, especially as he had objected to serving on the vessel. Historians believe he was elected for his navigational abilities and his personality, which history reflects was outspoken and opinionated.
Roberts&#x27; first act as captain was to lead the crew back to Príncipe to avenge the death of Captain Davis. Roberts and his crew landed on the island in the darkness of night, killed a large portion of the male population, and stole all items of value that they could carry away. Soon afterwards, he captured a Dutch Guineaman, then two days later a British ship called &quot;Experiment&quot;. The pirate ship took on water and provisions at Anamboe, where a vote was taken on whether the next voyage should be to the East Indies or to Brazil. The vote was for Brazil.

The combination of bravery and success that marked this adventure cemented most of the crew&#x27;s loyalty to Roberts. They concluded that he was &quot;pistol proof&quot; and that they had much to gain by staying with him.

=== Brazil and the Caribbean (July 1719 – May 1720) ===
Roberts and his crew crossed the Atlantic and watered and boot-topped their ship on the uninhabited island of Ferdinando. They spent about nine weeks off the Brazilian coast but saw no ships. They were about to leave for the West Indies when they encountered a fleet of 42 Portuguese ships in the Todos os Santos&#x27; Bay, waiting for two men-of-war of 70 guns each to escort them to Lisbon. Roberts took one of the vessels and ordered her master to point out the richest ship in the fleet. He pointed out &quot;Sagrada Familia,&quot; a ship of 40 guns and a crew of 170, which Roberts and his men boarded and captured. &quot;Sagrada Familia&quot; contained 40,000 gold moidores and jewellery designed for the King of Portugal, including a cross set with diamonds.

&quot;Rover&quot; next headed for Devil&#x27;s Island off the coast of Guiana to spend the booty. A few weeks later, they headed for the River Surinam where they captured a sloop. After they sighted a brigantine, Roberts took 40 men to pursue it in the sloop, leaving Walter Kennedy in command of &quot;Rover.&quot; The sloop became wind-bound for eight days, and when Roberts and his crew finally returned to their ship, they discovered that Kennedy had sailed off with &quot;Rover&quot; and what remained of the loot. Roberts and his crew renamed their sloop &quot;Fortune&quot; and agreed on new articles, now known as a pirate code, which they swore on a Bible to uphold.

In late February 1720, they were joined by French pirate Montigny la Palisse in another sloop, &quot;Sea King&quot;. The inhabitants of Barbados equipped two well-armed ships, &quot;Summerset&quot; and &quot;Philipa&quot;, to try to put an end to the pirate menace. On 26 February, they encountered the two pirate sloops. &quot;Sea King&quot; quickly fled, and &quot;Fortune&quot; broke off the engagement after sustaining considerable damage and was able to escape. Roberts headed for Dominica to repair the sloop, with twenty of his crew dying of their wounds on the voyage. There were also two sloops from Martinique out searching for the pirates, and Roberts swore vengeance against the inhabitants of Barbados and Martinique. He had a new flag made with a drawing of himself holding a flaming sword and standing upon 2 skulls, one labelled ABH (A Barbadian&#x27;s Head) and the other AMH (A Martiniquian&#x27;s Head), although this is not corroborated by period sources.

=== Newfoundland and the Caribbean (June 1720 – April 1721) ===
&quot;Fortune&quot; next headed northwards towards Newfoundland, raiding Canso, Nova Scotia, and capturing a number of ships around Cape Breton and the Newfoundland banks. Roberts raided the harbour of Ferryland, capturing a dozen vessels. On 21 June, he attacked the larger harbour of Trepassey, sailing in with black flags flying. In the harbour he discovered 22 merchant ships and 150 fishing ships. All of these vessels were abandoned by their panic-stricken captains and crews, and the pirates were masters of Trepassey without any resistance being offered. Roberts had captured all 22 merchant ships, but was angered by the cowardice of the captains who had fled their ships. Every morning he had a gun fired and the captains were forced to attend Roberts on board his ship; they were told that anyone who was absent would have his ship burnt. One brig from Bristol was taken over by the pirates to replace the sloop &quot;Fortune&quot; and fitted out with 16 guns. When the pirates left in late June, all the other vessels in the harbour were set on fire. During July, Roberts captured nine or ten French ships and commandeered one of them, fitting her with 26 cannons and changing her name to &quot;Good Fortune&quot;. With this more powerful ship, the pirates captured many more vessels before heading south for the West Indies, accompanied by Montigny la Palisse&#x27;s sloop, which had rejoined them.

In September 1720, &quot;Good Fortune&quot; was careened and repaired at the island of Carriacou before being renamed &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;, the first of several ships to be given this name by Roberts. In late September, &quot;Royal Fortune&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot; headed for the island of St. Christopher&#x27;s and entered Basse Terra Road, flying black flags and with their drummers and trumpeters playing. They sailed in among the ships in the Road, all of which promptly struck their flags. The next landfall was at the island of St. Bartholomew, where the French governor allowed the pirates to remain for several weeks to carouse. By 25 October, they were at sea again off St. Lucia, where they captured up to 15 French and English ships in the next three days. Among the captured ships was &quot;Greyhound&quot;, whose chief mate James Skyrme joined the pirates. He later became captain of Roberts&#x27; consort, &quot;Ranger&quot;.

During this time, Roberts reportedly caught Florimond Hurault de Montigny, the Governor of Martinique, who was sailing aboard a 52-gun French warship. The Governor was caught and promptly hanged on the yardarm of his own ship, which the pirates converted into the new &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;. According to Sanders as well as Konstam and Rickman, this reported capture was an embellishment by Captain Charles Johnson in his &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;. French sources confirm that while Roberts did capture and torture some French officials by pretending to hang them, he in fact released them, and Hurault was not among them.

By the spring of 1721, Roberts&#x27; depredations had almost brought seaborne trade to a standstill in the West Indies. &quot;Royal Fortune&quot; and &quot;Good Fortune&quot; therefore set sail for West Africa. On 18 April, Thomas Anstis, the commander of &quot;Good Fortune&quot;, left Roberts in the night and continued to raid shipping in the Caribbean, with future captains John Fenn and Brigstock Weaver aboard. &quot;Royal Fortune&quot; continued towards Africa.

=== West Africa (April 1721 – January 1722) ===
By late April, Roberts was at the Cape Verde islands. &quot;Royal Fortune&quot; was found to be leaky and abandoned there. The pirates transferred to &quot;Sea King&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;. The new &quot;Royal Fortune&quot; made landfall off the Guinea coast in early June, near the mouth of the Senegal River. Two French ships, one of 10 guns and one of 16 guns, gave chase, but were captured by Roberts. Both ships were commandeered. One, &quot;Comte de Toulouse&quot;, was renamed &quot;Ranger&quot;, while the other was named &quot;Little Ranger&quot; and used as a storeship. Thomas Sutton was made captain of &quot;Ranger&quot; and James Skyrme captain of &quot;Little Ranger&quot;.

Roberts next headed for Sierra Leone, arriving on 12 June. Here he was told by retired pirate John &quot;Old Crackers&quot; Leadstone that two Royal Navy ships, and , had left at the end of April, planning to return before Christmas. On 8 August, he captured two large ships at Point Cestos, now River Cess in Liberia. One of these was the frigate &quot;Onslow&quot;, transporting soldiers bound for Cape Coast (Cabo Corso) Castle. A number of the soldiers wished to join the pirates, and they were eventually accepted, however they only received a quarter of a pirates pay because they were not sailors most of their lives. &quot;Onslow&quot; was converted to become the fourth &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;. In November and December, the pirates careened their ships and relaxed at Cape Lopez and the island of Annobón. Sutton was replaced by Skyrme as captain of &quot;Ranger&quot;.

They captured several vessels in January 1722, then sailed into Ouidah (Whydah) harbour with black flags flying. The eleven ships at anchor there immediately struck their colours, but were restored to their owners after a ransom of eight pounds of gold dust per ship was paid. When the master of one of the ships refused these terms, Roberts had his crew climb aboard the ship and set her on fire. The captured vessels were slave ships, and the one set on fire had around eighty enslaved Africans on board. They perished either as a result of the fire or by drowning or shark attack after jumping overboard.

=== Death in battle ===

On 5 February 1722, Captain Chaloner Ogle of HMS &quot;Swallow&quot; came upon the pirate ships &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot;, and &quot;Little Ranger&quot; at Cape Lopez. &quot;Swallow&quot; veered away to avoid a shoal, making the pirates think that she was a fleeing merchant ship; some sources claim Ogle spotted Roberts&#x27; ships and turned &quot;Swallow&quot; as a ruse. &quot;Ranger&quot; departed in pursuit, commanded by James Skyrme. Once out of earshot of the other pirates, &quot;Swallow&quot; opened her gun ports and opened fire. Ten pirates were killed and Skyrme had his leg taken off by a cannonball, but he refused to leave the deck. Eventually, &quot;Ranger&quot; was forced to strike her colors, and the surviving crew were captured.

On 10 February, &quot;Swallow&quot; returned to Cape Lopez and found &quot;Royal Fortune&quot; still there. On the previous day, Roberts had captured &quot;Neptune&quot;, and many of his crew were drunk and unfit for duty just when he needed them most. At first, the pirates thought that the approaching ship was &quot;Ranger&quot; returning, but a deserter from &quot;Swallow&quot; recognized her and informed Roberts while he was breakfasting with Captain Hill, the master of &quot;Neptune&quot;. As he usually did before action, he dressed himself in his finest clothes:
The pirates&#x27; plan was to sail past &quot;Swallow&quot;, which meant exposing themselves to one broadside. Once past, they would have a good chance of escaping. However, the helmsman failed to keep &quot;Royal Fortune&quot; on the right course, and &quot;Swallow&quot; was able to approach to deliver a second broadside. Captain Roberts was killed by grapeshot, which struck him in the throat while he stood on the deck. Before his body could be captured by Ogle, Roberts&#x27;s wish to be buried at sea with all his arms and ornaments on (a request he had repeated in life) was fulfilled by his crew, who weighed his body down and threw it overboard after wrapping it in his ship&#x27;s sail. It was never found.

=== Aftermath ===

The battle continued for another two hours until &quot;Royal Fortune&quot;″s mainmast fell and the pirates signaled for quarter. One member of the crew, John Philips, tried to reach the magazine with a lighted match to blow up the ship, but was prevented by two men. Only three pirates had been killed in the battle, including Roberts. A total of 272 pirates serving under Roberts had been captured during the battle; of these, 65 were former African slaves that Roberts had emancipated, and they were sold back into slavery. The remainder were taken to Cape Coast Castle, apart from those who died on the voyage back. 54 were condemned to death, of whom 52 were hanged and two reprieved. Another twenty were allowed to sign indentures with the Royal African Company; Burl comments that they &quot;exchanged an immediate death for a lingering one&quot;. Seventeen men were sent to the Marshalsea prison in London for trial, where some were acquitted and released.

Of the captured pirates who told their place of birth, 42% were from Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset, and another 19% from London. There were smaller numbers from northern England and from Wales, and another quarter from a variety of countries including Ireland, Scotland, the West Indies, the Netherlands, and Greece.

Captain Chaloner Ogle was rewarded with a knighthood, the only British naval officer to be honoured specifically for his actions against pirates. He also profited financially, taking gold dust from Roberts&#x27; cabin, and he eventually became an admiral.

This battle proved a turning point in the war against the pirates, and many consider the death of Roberts to mark the end of the Golden Age of Piracy.

As recorded by Captain Charles Johnson regarding the articles of Bartholomew Roberts:

== Roberts&#x27; black flags ==
In modern history, Roberts has been attributed a variety of black flags from description, however, only two are corroborated by period eyewitness reports, of which one might be two separate designs.

One period eyewitness report is found in the Boston Gazette, 22 August 1720. It describes Roberts&#x27; Jolly Roger as “a Black Flag with Death&#x27;s head and a cutlass in it”. This design is corroborated by a separate period eyewitness report, given by a William Matthew, as used during the battle of Trepassy harbour, 1720. He describes the flag as featuring “a death&#x27;s head and an arm with a cutlass”. These two accounts could describe the same flag or two similar but separate designs. The swordarm was a common motif on naval flags at the time, among others, found on some Dutch bloody flags.

A second black flag design of Roberts is also known from period eyewitness reports. This design was used onboard one of his consort ships, captained by James Skyrme, in the Battle of Cape Lopez (1722), and was described by British Royal Navy officer Chaloner Ogle, who defeated Roberts and Skyrme in the aforementioned battle, as “a black flag, having a white skeleton in it”.

== Personal characteristics ==
Most of the information on Roberts comes from the book &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;, published a few years after Roberts&#x27; death. The original 1724 title page credits one Captain Charles Johnson as the author. (The book is often printed under the byline of Daniel Defoe on the assumption that &quot;Charles Johnson&quot; is a pseudonym, but there is no proof that Defoe is the author, and the matter remains in dispute.) Johnson devotes more space to Roberts than to any of the other pirates in his book, describing him as:

Roberts is commonly described as wearing a red waistcoat with scarlet breeches and a scarlet flamingo plume. The red costume may have been to disguise any blood in battle or as a demonstration of his disregard for anonymity. Roberts also wore a large diamond cross which was reputedly the property of the King of Portugal.

After his exploits in Newfoundland, a state Governor from New England commented that &quot;one cannot with-hold admiration for his bravery and courage&quot;. He hated cowardice, and when the crews of 22 ships in Trepassey harbour fled without firing a shot he was angry at their failure to defend their ships.

Roberts was the archetypal pirate captain in his love of fine clothing and jewelry, but he had some traits unusual in a pirate, notably a preference for drinking tea rather than rum. He is often described as a teetotaler and a Sabbatarian, but there is no proof of this. He certainly disliked drunkenness while at sea, yet it appears that he drank beer. Ironically, Roberts&#x27; final defeat was facilitated by the drunkenness of his crew. The Sabbatarian claim arises from the fact that musicians were not obliged to play on the Sabbath – this may merely have been intended to ensure the musicians a day&#x27;s rest, as they were otherwise obliged to play whenever the crew demanded. 

Black Bart was not as cruel to prisoners as some pirates such as Edward Low and Francis Spriggs, but did not treat them as well as did Samuel Bellamy, Howell Davis, or Edward England. Roberts sometimes gave gifts to cooperative captains and crews of captured ships, such as pieces of jewelry or items of captured cargo. He would sometimes ill-use prisoners if he felt that the crew demanded it, but:

<text>Kip Stephen Thorne (born June 1, 1940) is an American theoretical physicist and writer known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. Along with Rainer Weiss and Barry C. Barish, he was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.

A longtime friend and colleague of Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan, he was the Richard P. Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) until 2009 and speaks of the astrophysical implications of the general theory of relativity. He continues to do scientific research and scientific consulting, a notable example of which was for the Christopher Nolan film &quot;Interstellar&quot;.

==Life and career==

Thorne was born on June 1, 1940, in Logan, Utah. His father, D. Wynne Thorne (1908–1979), was a professor of soil chemistry at Utah State University, and his mother, Alison (née Comish; 1914–2004), was an economist and the first woman to receive a PhD in economics from Iowa State College. Raised in an academic environment, two of his four siblings also became professors. Thorne&#x27;s parents were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and raised Thorne in the LDS faith, though he now describes himself as atheist. Shortly before his mother&#x27;s death, she urged Kip and his siblings to leave the LDS Church because of its discrimination against women, which they all did. Regarding his views on science and religion, Thorne has stated: &quot;There are large numbers of my finest colleagues who are quite devout and believe in God ... There is no fundamental incompatibility between science and religion. I happen to not believe in God.&quot;

Thorne rapidly excelled at academics early in life, winning recognition in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search as a senior at Logan High School. He received his BS in physics degree from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1962, and his master and PhD in physics from Princeton University in 1964 and 1965 under the supervision of John Archibald Wheeler with a doctoral dissertation entitled &quot;Geometrodynamics of Cylindrical Systems&quot;.

Thorne returned to Caltech as an associate professor in 1967 and became a professor of theoretical physics in 1970, becoming one of the youngest full professors in the history of Caltech at age 30. He became the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor in 1981, and the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1991. He was an adjunct professor at the University of Utah from 1971 to 1998 and Andrew D. White Professor at Large at Cornell University from 1986 to 1992. In June 2009, he resigned his Feynman Professorship (he is now the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, Emeritus) to pursue a career of writing and movie making. His first film project was &quot;Interstellar&quot;, on which he worked with Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan.

Throughout the years, Thorne has served as a mentor and thesis advisor to many leading theorists who now work on observational, experimental, or astrophysical aspects of general relativity. Approximately 50 physicists have received PhDs at Caltech under Thorne&#x27;s personal mentorship.

Thorne is known for his ability to convey the excitement and significance of discoveries in gravitation and astrophysics to both professional and lay audiences. His presentations on subjects such as black holes, gravitational radiation, relativity, time travel, and wormholes have been included in PBS shows in the U.S. and on the BBC in the United Kingdom.

In the 2023 book &quot;The Warped Side of Our Universe&quot;, Thorne use poetry, and illustrations by Lia Halloran, to explain scientific concepts for the reader.

Thorne and Linda Jean Peterson married in 1960. Their children are Kares Anne and Bret Carter, an architect. Thorne and Peterson divorced in 1977. Thorne was set up on a blind date with Lynda Obst, later a film producer, by physicist Carl Sagan. They dated in 1979-1980, and parted and remained friends, to the extent that they later collaborated on &quot;Interstellar&quot;. Thorne and his second wife, Carolee Joyce Winstein, a professor of biokinesiology and physical therapy at USC, married in 1984.

==Research==

Thorne&#x27;s research has principally focused on relativistic astrophysics and gravitation physics, with emphasis on relativistic stars, black holes and especially gravitational waves. He is perhaps best known to the public for his controversial theory that wormholes can conceivably be used for time travel. However, Thorne&#x27;s scientific contributions, which center on the general nature of space, time, and gravity, span the full range of topics in general relativity.

===Gravitational waves and LIGO===
Thorne&#x27;s work has dealt with the prediction of gravitational wave strengths and their temporal signatures as observed on Earth. These &quot;signatures&quot; are of great relevance to LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), a multi-institution gravitational wave experiment for which Thorne has been a leading proponent – in 1984, he cofounded the LIGO Project (the largest project ever funded by the NSF) to discern and measure any fluctuations between two or more &#x27;static&#x27; points; such fluctuations would be evidence of gravitational waves, as calculations describe. A significant aspect of his research is developing the mathematics necessary to analyze these objects. Thorne also carries out engineering design analyses for features of the LIGO that cannot be developed on the basis of experiment and he gives advice on data analysis algorithms by which the waves will be sought. He has provided theoretical support for LIGO, including identifying gravitational wave sources that LIGO should target, designing the baffles to control scattered light in the LIGO beam tubes, and – in collaboration with Vladimir Braginsky&#x27;s (Moscow, Russia) research group – inventing quantum nondemolition designs for advanced gravity-wave detectors and ways to reduce the most serious kind of noise in advanced detectors: thermoelastic noise. With Carlton M. Caves, Thorne invented the back-action-evasion approach to quantum nondemolition measurements of the harmonic oscillators – a technique applicable both in gravitational wave detection and quantum optics.

On February 11, 2016, a team of four physicists representing the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, announced that in September 2015, LIGO recorded the signature of two black holes colliding 1.3 billion light-years away. This recorded detection was the first direct observation of the fleeting chirp of a gravitational wave and confirmed a prediction of the general theory of relativity.

===Black hole cosmology===
While studying for his PhD at Princeton University, his mentor John Wheeler assigned him a problem to think about: find out whether or not a cylindrical bundle of repulsive magnetic field lines will implode under its own attractive gravitational force. After several months wrestling with the problem, he proved that it was impossible for cylindrical magnetic field lines to implode.

Why won&#x27;t a cylindrical bundle of magnetic field lines implode, while spherical stars &quot;will&quot; implode under their own gravitational force? Thorne tried to explore the theoretical ridge between these two phenomena. He eventually determined that the gravitational force can overcome all interior pressure only when an object has been compressed in all directions. To express this realization, Thorne proposed his hoop conjecture, which describes an imploding star turning into a black hole when the critical circumference of the designed hoop can be placed around it and set into rotation. That is, any object of mass M around which a hoop of circumference formula_1 can be spun must be a black hole.

As a tool to be used in both enterprises — astrophysics and theoretical physics — Thorne and his students have developed an unusual approach, called the &quot;membrane paradigm&quot;, to the theory of black holes and used it to clarify the Blandford–Znajek mechanism by which black holes may power some quasars and active galactic nuclei.

Thorne has investigated the quantum statistical mechanical origin of the entropy of a black hole. With his postdoc Wojciech Zurek, he showed that the entropy of a black hole is the logarithm of the number of ways that the hole could have been made.

With Igor Novikov and Don Page, he developed the general relativistic theory of thin accretion disks around black holes, and using this theory he deduced that with a doubling of its mass by such accretion a black hole will be spun up to 0.998 of the maximum spin allowed by general relativity, but not any farther. This is probably the maximum black-hole spin allowed in nature.

===Wormholes and time travel===

Thorne and his co-workers at Caltech conducted scientific research on whether the laws of physics permit space and time to be multiply connected (can there exist classical, traversable wormholes and &quot;time machines&quot;?). With Sung-Won Kim, Thorne identified a universal physical mechanism (the explosive growth of vacuum polarization of quantum fields), that may always prevent spacetime from developing closed timelike curves (i.e., prevent backward time travel).

With Mike Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever, he showed that traversable wormholes can exist in the structure of spacetime only if they are threaded by quantum fields in quantum states that violate the averaged null energy condition (i.e. have negative renormalized energy spread over a sufficiently large region). This has triggered research to explore the ability of quantum fields to possess such extended negative energy. Recent calculations by Thorne indicate that simple masses passing through traversable wormholes could never engender paradoxes – there are &quot;no&quot; initial conditions that lead to paradox once time travel is introduced. If his results can be generalized, they would suggest that none of the supposed paradoxes formulated in time travel stories can actually be formulated at a precise physical level: that is, that &quot;any&quot; situation in a time travel story turns out to permit &quot;many&quot; consistent solutions.

===Relativistic stars, multipole moments and other endeavors===
With Anna Żytkow, Thorne predicted the existence of red supergiant stars with neutron-star cores (Thorne–Żytkow objects). He laid the foundations for the theory of pulsations of relativistic stars and the gravitational radiation they emit. With James Hartle, Thorne derived from general relativity the laws of motion and precession of black holes and other relativistic bodies, including the influence of the coupling of their multipole moments to the spacetime curvature of nearby objects, as well as writing down the Hartle-Thorne metric, an approximate solution which describes the exterior of a slowly and rigidly rotating, stationary and axially symmetric body.

Thorne has also theoretically predicted the existence of universally antigravitating &quot;exotic matter&quot; – the element needed to accelerate the expansion rate of the universe, keep traversable wormhole &quot;Star Gates&quot; open and keep timelike geodesic free float &quot;warp drives&quot; working. With Clifford Will and others of his students, he laid the foundations for the theoretical interpretation of experimental tests of relativistic theories of gravity – foundations on which Will and others then built. , Thorne was interested in the origin of classical space and time from the quantum foam of quantum gravity theory.

==Publications==
Thorne has written and edited books on topics in gravitational theory and high-energy astrophysics. In 1973, he co-authored the textbook &quot;Gravitation&quot; with Charles Misner and John Wheeler; that according to John C. Baez and Chris Hillman, is one of the great scientific books of all time and has inspired two generations of students. In 1994, he published &quot;Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein&#x27;s Outrageous Legacy&quot;, a book for non-scientists for which he received numerous awards. This book has been published in six languages, and editions in Chinese, Italian, Czech, and Polish are in press. In 2014, Thorne published &quot;The Science of Interstellar&quot; in which he explains the science behind Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;Interstellar&quot;; Nolan wrote the foreword to the book. In September 2017, Thorne and Roger D. Blandford published &quot;Modern Classical Physics: Optics, Fluids, Plasmas, Elasticity, Relativity, and Statistical Physics&quot;, a graduate-level textbook covering the six major areas of physics listed in the title.

Thorne&#x27;s articles have appeared in publications such as:
* &quot;Scientific American&quot;,
* McGraw-Hill &quot;Yearbook of Science and Technology&quot;, and
* &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; among others.

Thorne has published more than 150 articles in scholarly journals.

==Adaptation in media==
* Thorne contributed ideas on wormhole travel to Carl Sagan for use in his novel &quot;Contact&quot;.
* Thorne and his friend, producer Lynda Obst, also developed the concept for the Christopher Nolan film &quot;Interstellar&quot;. He also wrote a tie-in book, &quot;The Science of Interstellar&quot;. Thorne later advised Nolan on the physics of his movie &quot;Tenet&quot;, and advised Cillian Murphy on his portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.
* In Larry Niven&#x27;s novel &quot;Rainbow Mars&quot;, the time travel technology used in the novel is based on the wormhole theories of Thorne, which in the context of the novel was when time travel first became possible, rather than just fantasy. As a result, any attempts to travel in time prior to Thorne&#x27;s development of wormhole theory results in the time traveller entering a fantastic version of reality, rather than the actual past.
* In the film &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;, Thorne was portrayed by actor Enzo Cilenti.
* Thorne played himself in the episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; entitled &quot;The Laureate Accumulation&quot;.
* Thorne is featured in an episode of the documentary series &quot;The Craftsman&quot; entitled &quot;Science, Art &amp; Inspiration&quot;.

<doc id="238522" wikidata="Q902236" url="?curid=238522" title="Marsh test">
<text>The Marsh test is a highly sensitive method in the detection of arsenic, especially useful in the field of forensic toxicology when arsenic was used as a poison. It was developed by the chemist James Marsh and first published in 1836. The method continued to be used, with improvements, in forensic toxicology until the 1970s.

Arsenic, in the form of white arsenic trioxide , was a highly favored poison, being odourless, easily incorporated into food and drink, and before the advent of the Marsh test, untraceable in the body. In France, it came to be known as &quot;&quot; (&quot;inheritance powder&quot;). For the untrained, arsenic poisoning will have symptoms similar to cholera.

== Precursor methods ==
The first breakthrough in the detection of arsenic poisoning was in 1775 when Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered a way to change arsenic trioxide to garlic-smelling arsine gas (AsH3), by treating it with nitric acid (HNO3) and combining it with zinc.

: As2O3 + 6 Zn + 12 HNO3 → 2 AsH3 + 6 Zn(NO3)2 + 3 H2O

In 1787, German physician (1739-1805) discovered that if arsenic trioxide were heated in the presence of carbon, the arsenic would sublime. This is the reduction of As2O3 by carbon:

: 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 3 CO2 + 4 As

In 1806, Valentin Rose took the stomach of a victim suspected of being poisoned and treated it with potassium carbonate (K2CO3), calcium oxide (CaO) and nitric acid. Any arsenic present would appear as arsenic trioxide and then could be subjected to Metzger&#x27;s test.

The most common test (and used even today in water test kits) was discovered by Samuel Hahnemann. It would involve combining a sample fluid with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the presence of hydrochloric acid (HCl). A yellow precipitate, arsenic trisulfide (As2S3) would be formed if arsenic was present.

== Circumstances and methodology ==
Though precursor tests existed, they had sometimes proven not to be sensitive enough. In 1832, a certain John Bodle was brought to trial for poisoning his grandfather by putting arsenic in his coffee. James Marsh, a chemist working at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, was called by the prosecution to try to detect its presence. He performed the standard test by passing hydrogen sulfide through the suspect fluid. While Marsh was able to detect arsenic, the yellow precipitate did not keep very well, and, by the time it was presented to the jury, it had deteriorated. The jury was not convinced, and John Bodle was acquitted.

Angered and frustrated by this, especially when John Bodle confessed later that he indeed killed his grandfather, Marsh decided to devise a better test to demonstrate the presence of arsenic. Taking Scheele&#x27;s work as a basis, he constructed a simple glass apparatus capable of not only detecting minute traces of arsenic but also measuring its quantity. Adding a sample of tissue or body fluid to a glass vessel with zinc and acid would produce arsine gas if arsenic was present, in addition to the hydrogen that would be produced regardless by the zinc reacting with the acid. Igniting this gas mixture would oxidize any arsine present into arsenic and water vapor. This would cause a cold ceramic bowl held in the jet of the flame to be stained with a silvery-black deposit of arsenic, physically similar to the result of Metzger&#x27;s reaction. The intensity of the stain could then be compared to films produced using known amounts of arsenic. Not only could minute amounts of arsenic be detected (as little as 0.02 mg), the test was very specific for arsenic. Although antimony (Sb) could give a false-positive test by forming stibine (SbH3) gas, which decomposes on heating to form a similar black deposit, it would not dissolve in a solution of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), while arsenic would. Bismuth (Bi), which also gives a false positive by forming bismuthine (BiH3), similarly can be distinguished by how it resists attack by both NaOCl and ammonium polysulfide (the former attacks As, and the latter attacks Sb).

== Specific reactions involved ==
The Marsh test treats the sample with sulfuric acid and arsenic-free zinc. Even if there are minute amounts of arsenic present, the zinc reduces the trivalent arsenic (As3+). Here are the two half-reactions:

: Oxidation: Zn → Zn2+ + 2 e−
: Reduction: As2O3 + 12 e− + 6 H+ → 2 As3− + 3 H2O

Overall, we have this reaction:

: As2O3 + 6 Zn + 6 H+ → 2 As3− + 6 Zn2+ + 3 H2O

In an acidic medium, is protonated to form arsine gas (AsH3), so adding sulphuric acid (H2SO4) to each side of the equation we get:

: As2O3 + 6 Zn + 6 H+ + 6 H2SO4 → 2 As3− + 6 H2SO4 + 6 Zn2+ + 3 H2O

As the As3− combines with the H+ to form arsine:

: As2O3 + 6 Zn + 6 H+ + 6 H2SO4 → 2 AsH3 + 6 ZnSO4 + 3 H2O + 6 H+

By eliminating the common ions:

: As2O3 + 6 Zn + 6 H2SO4 → 2 AsH3 + 6 ZnSO4 + 3 H2O

== First notable application ==

Although the Marsh test was efficacious, its first publicly documented use—in fact, the first time evidence from forensic toxicology was ever introduced—was in Tulle, France in 1840 with the celebrated Lafarge poisoning case. Charles Lafarge, a foundry owner, was suspected of being poisoned with arsenic by his wife Marie. The circumstantial evidence was great: it was shown that she bought arsenic trioxide from a local chemist, supposedly to kill rats that infested their home. In addition, their maid swore that she had mixed a white powder into his drink. Although the food was found to be positive for the poison using the old methods as well as the Marsh test, when the husband&#x27;s body was exhumed and tested, the chemists assigned to the case were not able to detect arsenic. Mathieu Orfila, the renowned toxicologist retained by the defense and an acknowledged authority of the Marsh test, examined the results. He performed the test again, and demonstrated that the Marsh test was not at fault for the misleading results, but, rather, that those who performed it did it incorrectly. Orfila thus proved the presence of arsenic in Lafarge&#x27;s body using the test. As a result of this, Marie was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.

== Effects ==
The Lafarge case proved to be controversial, for it divided the country into factions who were convinced or otherwise of Mme. Lafarge&#x27;s guilt; nevertheless, the impact of the Marsh test was great. The French press covered the trial and gave the test the publicity it needed to give the field of forensic toxicology the legitimacy it deserved, although in some ways it trivialized it: actual Marsh test assays were conducted in salons, public lectures and even in some plays that recreated the Lafarge case. 

The existence of the Marsh test also served a deterrent effect: deliberate arsenic poisonings became rarer because the fear of discovery became more prevalent. 

== In fiction ==
Marsh test is used in &quot;Bill Bergson Lives Dangerously&quot; to prove that a certain chocolate is poisoned with arsenic.

Lord Peter Wimsey’s manservant Bunter uses Marsh’s test in &quot;Strong Poison&quot; to demonstrate that the culprit was secretly in possession of arsenic.

In Alan Bradley&#x27;s &quot;As Chimney Sweepers Come To Dust&quot;, 12-year old sleuth and chemistry genius Flavia de Luce uses the Marsh test to determine that arsenic was the murderer&#x27;s weapon.

In the first episode of the 2017 BBC television series &quot;Taboo&quot; a mirror test, referencing the Marsh test, is used to verify the protagonist&#x27;s father was killed via arsenic poisoning. As the setting of the series is between 1814-1820, however, the test&#x27;s appearance is anachronistic.

In the episode &quot;The King Came Calling&quot; of the first season of &quot;Ripper Street&quot;, police surgeon Homer Jackson (Matthew Rothenberg) performs Marsh&#x27;s test on the contents of a poisoning victim and determines that the fatal poison was antimony, not arsenic, since the chemical residue deposited by the flames does not dissolve in sodium hypochlorite.

<text>Sigmaringen (Swabian: &quot;Semmerenga&quot;) is a town in southern Germany, in the state of Baden-Württemberg. Situated on the upper Danube, it is the capital of the Sigmaringen district.

Sigmaringen is renowned for its castle, Schloss Sigmaringen, which was the seat of the principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen until 1850 and is still owned by the Hohenzollern family.

==Geography==
Surrounded by wooded hills Sigmaringen lies in the Danube valley, south of the Swabian Alps and around 40 km north of Lake Constance.

The surrounding towns are Winterlingen (in the district of Zollernalb) and Veringenstadt in the north, Bingen, Sigmaringendorf, and Scheer in the east, Mengen, Krauchenwies, Inzigkofen, and Meßkirch in the south, and Leibertingen, Beuron, and Stetten am kalten Markt in the west.
The town is made up of the following districts: Sigmaringen town center, Gutenstein, Jungnau, Laiz, Oberschmeien, and Unterschmeien.

===Climate===
Sigmaringen&#x27;s climate is classified as humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dclo&quot;).
==History==
Sigmaringen was first attested in a document from in 1077 and was part of the principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen from 1576 until 1850, after which it became the Prussian Province of Hohenzollern.

===Middle Ages===
In the 11th century, in the end of the Early Middle Ages, the first castle was built on the rock that protected the valley. The first written reference dates from 1077, when King Rudolf of Rheinfelden tried in vain to conquer Sigmaringen Castle. The city was officially founded in 1250. In 1325, it was sold to Ulrich III, Count of Württemberg. In 1460 and 1500, the castle was rebuilt into a chateau. About the county of Werdenberg Sigmaringen came in 1535 to be owned by the high noble family of the Hohenzollern.

===Modern times===
In 1632, the Swedes occupied the castle during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

From 1806 to 1849, Sigmaringen was the capital of the sovereign Principality Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and residence of the princes of Hohenzollern.

As a result of the Sigmaringen Revolution of 1848, the Princes of Hechingen and Sigmaringen abdicated, whereby both principalities fell to Prussia in 1850. From 1850 to 1945, Sigmaringen was the seat of the Prussian Government for the Province of Hohenzollern. Karl Anton von Hohenzollern was 1858-1862 Prime Minister of Prussia. 
From 1914 to 1918, around 150 men from the town died during World War I. 
In the Nazi era, a Gestapo office was located in Sigmaringen. From 1937, it belonged to Stuttgart&#x27;s Gestapo.

Between 1934 and 1942, more than 100 men were sterilized because of &quot;hereditary diseases&quot;. On 12 December 1940, during the Nazi medical experiments known as the &quot;T4&quot;, 71 mentally disabled and mentally ill patients became the victims of Nazi injustice. These men and women were deported to the Grafeneck Euthanasia Centre, where they were killed as &quot;unworthy of life&quot;. After the closure of Grafeneck in December 1940, a further deportation to the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre occurred on 14 March 1941.

====Vichy French enclave (1944–1945)====

On 7 September 1944, following the Allied invasion of France, Philippe Pétain and members of the Vichy government cabinet were relocated to Germany, a move which Petain fiercely fought against. A city-state ruled by the government in exile headed by Fernand de Brinon was established at Sigmaringen. One of his most notorious members was Joseph Darnand, hero of First World War and who, because of his deep admiration for Petain (for him, he was the &quot;Victor of Verdun&quot;), he followed to the bitter end, his execution by fire squad. There were three embassies in the city-state, representing each of Vichy-France&#x27;s allies: Germany, Italy, and Japan.

French writers Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Lucien Rebatet and Roland Gaucher, fearing for their lives because of their political and antisemitic writings, fled along with the Vichy government to Sigmaringen. Céline&#x27;s novel &quot;D&#x27;un château l&#x27;autre&quot; (English: &quot;Castle to Castle&quot;) describes the fall of Sigmaringen. The city was taken by Free French forces on 22 April 1945. Pétain returned to France, where he stood trial for treason and was condemned to death, though the sentence was commuted by Charles de Gaulle.

==Transportation infrastructure==
Three railways meet in Sigmaringen, the Ulm–Sigmaringen railway leading to Ulm, the Tübingen–Sigmaringen railway from Tübingen to Aulendorf and connecting to the Tuttlingen–Inzigkofen railway to Tuttlingen, and the Engstingen–Sigmaringen railway operated by the Hohenzollerische Landesbahn.

Sigmaringen lies in the serving area of Verkehrsverbund Neckar-Alb-Donau (NALDO).

<text>The Virginia Company of London (sometimes called &quot;London Company&quot;) was a division of the Virginia Company with responsibility for colonizing the east coast of North America between latitudes 34° and 41° N.

==History==
===Origins===

The territory granted to the Virginia Company of London included the eastern coast of North America from the 34th parallel at Cape Fear north to the 41st parallel in Long Island Sound. As part of the Virginia Company and Colony, the Virginia Company of London owned a large portion of Atlantic and inland Canada. The company was permitted by its charter to establish a settlement within this area. The portion of the company&#x27;s territory north of the 38th parallel was shared with the Plymouth Company, with the stipulation that neither company found a colony within 100 miles (161 km) of the other.

The Virginia Company of London made landfall on 26 April 1607, at the southern edge of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, which they named Cape Henry, near present-day Virginia Beach. Deciding to move the encampment, on 4 May 1607 they established the Jamestown Settlement on the James River about upstream from its mouth at the Chesapeake Bay. Later in 1607, the Plymouth Company established its Popham Colony in present-day Maine, but it was abandoned after about a year. By 1609, the Plymouth Company had dissolved. As a result, the charter for the Virginia Company of London was adjusted with a new grant that extended from &quot;sea to sea&quot; of the previously shared area between the 38th and the 40th parallels. It was amended in 1612 to include the new territory of the Somers Isles (or Bermuda).

The Virginia Company of London struggled financially, especially with labor shortages in its Virginia colony. Its profits improved after sweeter strains of tobacco than the native variety were cultivated and successfully exported from Virginia as a cash crop beginning in 1612. By 1619 a system of indentured service was fully developed in the colony; the same year the home government passed a law that prohibited the commercial growing of tobacco in England. In 1624, the company lost its charter, and Virginia became a royal colony.

A spin-off, The Virginia Company of London of The Somers Isles (fully the Company of the City of London for the Plantation of The Somers Isles, but generally referred to as the Somers Isles Company), operated until 1684.

In Renaissance England, wealthy merchants were eager to find investment opportunities, so they established several companies to trade in various parts of the world. Each company was made up of investors, known as &quot;adventurers&quot;, who purchased shares of company stock. The Crown granted a charter to each company with a monopoly to explore, settle, or trade with a particular region of the world. Profits were shared among the investors according to the amount of stock that each owned. More than 6,300 Englishmen invested in joint-stock companies between 1585 and 1630, trading in Russia, Turkey, Africa, the East Indies, the Mediterranean, and North America.

===Founding===
Investors in the Virginia Company hoped to profit from the natural resources of the New World. In 1606 Captain Bartholomew Gosnold obtained from King James I a charter for two companies. The first, the Virginia Company of London (now known generally as the &quot;Virginia Company of London&quot;), covered what is now Maryland, Virginia and Carolina, between latitude 34° and latitude 41° north. Gosnold&#x27;s principal backers were Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, Edward Wingfield and Richard Hakluyt.

The second company, the Plymouth Company of London (today known as the &quot;Plymouth Company&quot;), was empowered to settle as far as 45° North, encompassing what is present-day Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and New England.

The company paid all the costs of establishing each colony, and in return controlled all land and resources there, requiring all settlers to work for the company.

The first leader of the Virginia Company in England was its treasurer, Sir Thomas Smythe, who arranged the 1609 charter. He had been governor of the East India Company since 1603 and continued with one break until 1620.

In an extensive publicity campaign, Wingfield, Gosnold and a few others, circulated pamphlets, plays, sermons and broadsides throughout England to raise interest in New World investments. Investors could buy stock individually or in groups. Almost 1,700 people purchased shares, including men of different occupations and classes, wealthy women, and representatives of institutions such as trade guilds, towns and cities. Proceeds from the sale of stock were used to help finance the costs of establishing overseas settlements, including paying for ships and supplies and recruiting and outfitting laborers. A single share of stock in the Virginia Company cost 12 pounds 10 shillings, the equivalent of more than six months&#x27; wages for an ordinary working man.

The largest single investor was Thomas West, Lord de la Warre, who served as the first governor of Virginia between 1610 and 1618. (The English colonists named the Delaware River and Native American Lenape tribe, called the Delaware Indians, after him.)

The business of the company was the settlement of the Virginia colony, supported by a labor force of voluntary transportees under the customary indenture system. In exchange for 7 years of labor for the company, the company provided passage, food, protection, and land ownership (if the worker survived).

===First expedition===
In December 1606, the Virginia Company&#x27;s three ships, containing 105 men and boys as passengers and 39 crew members, set sail from Blackwall, London and made landfall on 26 April 1607 at the southern edge of the mouth of what they named the James River on the Chesapeake Bay. They named this shore Cape Henry. They were attacked by Native Americans, and the settlers moved north. On 14 May 1607, these first settlers selected the site of Jamestown Island, further upriver and on the northern shore, as the place to build their fort.

In addition to survival, the early colonists were expected to make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they realized there was great potential for a wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land&#x27;s fertility. From the outset, settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain&#x27;s forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England&#x27;s (and then Britain&#x27;s) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.
Within the three-sided fort erected on the banks of the James, the settlers quickly discovered that they were, first and foremost, employees of the Virginia Company of London, following instructions of the men appointed by the company to rule them. In exchange, the laborers were armed (though gunpowder was stored separately at the powder magazine, to be distributed in definite quantities monthly for hunting purposes, or by a high order in case of other necessity, otherwise the settlers were forbidden to store gunpowder at home,) and received clothes and food from the common store. After seven years, they were to receive land of their own. The gentlemen, who provided their armor and weapons, were to be paid in land, dividends, or additional shares of stock.

Initially, the colonists were governed by a president and a seven-member council selected by the King. Leadership problems quickly erupted. Jamestown&#x27;s first two leaders coped with varying degrees of success with sickness, assaults by Native Americans, poor food and water supplies, and class strife. Many colonists were ill-prepared to carve out a new settlement on a frontier. When Captain John Smith became Virginia&#x27;s third president, he proved the strong leader that the colony needed. Industry flourished and relations with Chief Powhatan&#x27;s people improved.

=== Instructions ===
After so many failed colonizing attempts in the 16th century such as the Roanoke Colony, and with the ascension of King James to the throne of England on 24 March 1603, the effort to colonize was renewed, but this time in the form of joint-stock companies, which did not involve the king&#x27;s treasury, also known as the public treasury. Thus it became, from a royal perspective at least, a largely risk-free endeavor. Although a profit-driven enterprise, the king was motivated by international rivalry and the propagation of religion, and the individuals who ventured to the New World were motivated by a chance to improve their economic and social standing.

Thus King James awarded a patent to a group of investors which included detailed instructions for everything from where to place watchmen and with how many, to where to plant. It instructed Christopher Newport, captain of the Susan Constant, and Bartholomew Gosnold, captain of the Godspeed and leader of the expedition of three ships, on their duties upon reaching the land they named Virginia. There were no instructions for administration or governance.

=== The Charter of 1606 ===

The First Virginia Charter established provisions for the governance of the colony. It was to be governed by a colonial council, which proved ineffective. A governor, Lord De La Warr, was dispatched in 1610 to provide firmer governance of the colony. The council back in London whose directives and interests Lord De La Warr represented was composed of knights, gentlemen and merchants who had invested in the company. This charter also limited the jurisdiction of the Virginia Company of London to 100 miles from the seaboard and from 38 degrees to 45 degrees latitude north.

===Charter of 1609===
In 1609, the Virginia Company received its Second Charter, which allowed the company to choose its new governor from among its shareholders. Investment boomed as the company launched an intensive recruitment campaign. Over 600 colonists set sail for Virginia between March 1608 and March 1609.

Sir Thomas Gates, Virginia&#x27;s deputy governor, bound for the colony in the Third Supply aboard the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, was shipwrecked in Bermuda, along with the admiral of the company, Sir George Somers, Captain Newport, and 147 other settlers and seamen. When Gates finally arrived to take up his new post in 1610, with most of the survivors of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; (on two new ships built in Bermuda, the &quot;Deliverance&quot; and the &quot;Patience&quot;), he found that only 60 of the original 214 colonists had survived the infamous &quot;Starving Time&quot; of 1609–1610. Most of these were dying or ill. Despite the abundance of food which Gates&#x27; expedition brought from Bermuda (which had necessitated the building of two ships), it was clear the colony was not yet self-sufficient and could not survive.

The survivors of Jamestown were taken aboard the &quot;Deliverance&quot; and the &quot;Patience&quot;, and the colony was abandoned. Gates intended to transport all the settlers back to England, but the fortuitous arrival of another relief fleet, bearing Governor Lord De la Warre, granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were put ashore again, and Sir George Somers returned to Bermuda aboard the &quot;Patience&quot; to obtain more food. (Somers died there, and his nephew, Matthew Somers, the captain of the &quot;Patience&quot;, sailed the vessel to Lyme Regis in England instead, to claim his inheritance.)

=== Charter of 1612 ===
The third Virginia Charter or Charter of 1612, was essentially the same as the Charter of 1609, with the difference being territorial jurisdiction, expanding it to the Atlantic Islands like Bermuda and from &quot;sea to sea&quot;. In &quot;domestic correspondence&quot; written by John Chamberlain to The Right Honorable Sir Dudley Carlton, Knight, His Maties [read: Majesty&#x27;s] Ambassador at Venice dated 12 February 1612, Chamberlain wrote:

This is also quoted in &quot;Bermuda under the Sommer Islands Company 1612–1684&quot; by A. C. Hollis Hallett:

Administration of the Somers Isles, alias Islands of Bermuda, was in fact transferred in 1615 to a spin-off of the Virginia Company of London titled the Company of the City of London for the Plantacion of The Somers Isles, which administered that colony until losing its royal charter in 1684. Bermuda remained strongly linked to Virginia (the nearest English territory to it until Carolina Colony was settled from Bermuda in 1670 under William Sayle); however, until the American War of Independence, when rebel General George Washington of Virginia would address a letter to the people of Bermuda seeking their aid in the war:

By this Charter, neither the stock issue of 1609 nor the authorized lottery system mitigated the shortage of cash flow.

=== The &quot;Great Charter&quot; ===
This was an ordinance and constitution that proceeded from a set of instructions issued in 1618 to the governor and the Council of Virginia known as An Ordinance and Constitution of the Virginia Company in England on 24 July 1621. This document replaced military law with common law, and provided for land ownership for settlers living in the colony. It is also of great significance for it provides governance independent of the Crown. An assembly took place in a church composed of Governor Sir George Yeardley and 22 select men representing seven regions. They then organized into a legislative body, establishing a precedent for self-governance, a pivotal point in American history.

===Collapse and dissolution===
After 1620, with growing demand for tobacco on the continent, the company arranged to sell Virginia tobacco in the Netherlands, but the next year and despite company pleas to maintain the privilege of freedom of trade, the Privy Council forbade the export of any product of Virginia to a foreign country until the commodities had been landed in England, and English duties had been paid. By 1621, the company was in trouble; unpaid dividends and increased use of lotteries had made future investors wary. The company debt was now over £9,000. Worried Virginians were hardly reassured by the advice of pragmatic Treasurer Edwin Sandys who warned that the company &quot;cannot wish you to rely on anything but yourselves&quot;. In March 1622, the company&#x27;s and the colony&#x27;s situation went from dire to disastrous when, during the Indian massacre of 1622, the Powhatan confederacy killed one-quarter of the European population of the Virginia colony.

When the Crown and company officials proposed a fourth charter, severely reducing the company&#x27;s ability to make decisions in the governing of Virginia, subscribers rejected it. King James I forthwith changed the status of Virginia in 1624, taking control of it as a royal colony to be administered by a governor appointed by the King. However, the government&#x27;s colonial policy of export restrictions did not change. The Crown approved the election of a Virginia Assembly in 1627. This form of government, with governor and assembly, would oversee the colony of Virginia until 1776, excepting only the years of the English Commonwealth.

Bermuda had been separated from the Virginia Company in 1614, when the Crown briefly took over its administration. In 1615, the shareholders of the Virginia Company created a new company, the Somers Isles Company, which continued to operate Bermuda. It was subsequently, also known officially as &quot;The Somers Isles&quot; (for the Admiral of the Virginia Company, Sir George Somers) until being dissolved in 1684 and made a royal colony. Meetings were held at town hall to discuss the distribution of the tobacco.

==Native American relationships==
The instructions issued to Sir Thomas Gates, on 20 November 1608, called for a forcible conversion of Native Americans to Anglicanism and their subordination to the colonial administration. The records of the company record a discussion during one of its first meetings about publishing a justification of their business enterprise methods to &quot;give adventurers, a clearness and satisfaction&quot;, a public debate where Catholics and neutrals might attack them. Whereas Catholic arguments would be in support of Spanish legal claims to the New World under the Treaty of Tordesillas, it was feared that the neutral &quot;pen-adversaries&quot; might &quot;cast scruples into our conscience&quot; by &quot;criticising the lawfulness of the plantation.&quot; It was decided to forego such a publication of a justification.

In 1608, Sir Edward Coke, in his capacity as Lord Chief Justice, offered a ruling in &quot;Calvin&#x27;s Case&quot; that went beyond the issue at hand: whether a Scotsman could seek justice at an English Court. Coke distinguished between aliens from nations at war with England and friendly aliens, those from nations in league with England. Friendly aliens could have recourse to English courts. But he also ruled that with &quot;all infidels&quot; (i.e. those from non-Christian nations), there could be no peace, and a state of perpetual hostility would exist between them and Christians.

In 1609, the company issued instructions to settlers to kidnap Native American children so as to educate them with English values and religion. These instructions also sanctioned attacking the Iniocasoockes, the cultural leaders of the local Powhatans. Only after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr arrived in 1610, was the company able to commence a war against the Powhatan with the First Anglo-Powhatan War. De La Warr was replaced by Sir Thomas Dale, who continued the war, which continued until a truce was made with the marriage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe in 1614.

The military offensive was accompanied by a propaganda war: Alderman Robert Johnson published &quot;Nova Britannia&quot;, in 1609, which compared Native Americans to wild animals—&quot;heardes of deere in a forest&quot;. While it did portray the Powhatan as peace-loving, it threatened to deal with any who resisted conversion to Anglicanism as enemies of their country. (Johnson was the son-in-law of Sir Thomas Smythe, treasurer of the company in London and leader of its &quot;court&quot; faction.)

The company began to turn a profit after 1612, when planting a couple of new varieties of tobacco yielded a product that appealed more to English tastes than the native tobacco. Tobacco became the commodity crop of the colony, and settlers were urged to cultivate more. The colony struggled with labor shortages as mortality was high.

In 1622, the Second Anglo-Powhatan War erupted. Its origins are disputed. English apologists for the company say that Opchanacanough initiated the war. Robert Williams, a 21st-century Native American law professor, argues that Opchanacanough had secured concessions from Governor Yeardley which the company would not accept. Thus, Opchanacanough&#x27;s attack, on 18 April 1622, may have been a pre-emptive attempt to defeat the colony before reinforcements arrived. 

In about a day, the Powhatan killed 350 of 1,240 colonists, destroying some outlying settlements. The Virginia Company quickly published an account of this attack. It was steeped in Calvinist theology of the time: the massacre was the work of Providence in that it was justification for the destruction of the Powhatan, and building English settlements over their former towns. New orders from the Virginia Company of London directed a &quot;perpetual war without peace or truce&quot; &quot;to root out from being any longer a people, so cursed a nation, ungrateful to all benefitte, and incapable of all goodnesses&quot;. Within two years, the Crown took over the territory in 1624 as a royal colony.

<doc id="238525" wikidata="Q334599" url="?curid=238525" title="Arsine">
<text>Arsine (IUPAC name: arsane) is an inorganic compound with the formula AsH3. This flammable, pyrophoric, and highly toxic pnictogen hydride gas is one of the simplest compounds of arsenic. Despite its lethality, it finds some applications in the semiconductor industry and for the synthesis of organoarsenic compounds. The term &quot;arsine&quot; is commonly used to describe a class of organoarsenic compounds of the formula AsH3−&quot;x&quot;R&quot;x&quot;, where R = aryl or alkyl. For example, As(C6H5)3, called triphenylarsine, is referred to as &quot;an arsine&quot;.

==General properties==
In its standard state arsine is a colorless, denser-than-air gas that is slightly soluble in water (2% at 20 °C) and in many organic solvents as well. Arsine itself is odorless, but it oxidizes in air and this creates a slight garlic or fish-like scent when the compound is present above 0.5ppm. This compound is kinetically stable: at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of ca. 230 °C, decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is sufficiently rapid to be the basis of the Marsh test for arsenic presence. Similar to stibine, the decomposition of arsine is autocatalytic, as the arsenic freed during the reaction acts as a catalyst for the same reaction. Several other factors, such as humidity, presence of light and certain catalysts (namely alumina) facilitate the rate of decomposition.

AsH3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule with H–As–H angles of 91.8° and three equivalent As–H bonds, each of 1.519 Å length.

==Discovery and synthesis==
AsH3 is generally prepared by the reaction of As3+ sources with H− equivalents.
::4 AsCl3 + 3 NaBH4 → 4 AsH3 + 3 NaCl + 3 BCl3
As reported in 1775, Carl Scheele reduced arsenic(III) oxide with zinc in the presence of acid. This reaction is a prelude to the Marsh test.

Alternatively, sources of As3− react with protonic reagents to also produce this gas. Zinc arsenide and sodium arsenide are suitable precursors:
::Zn3As2 + 6 H+ → 2 AsH3 + 3 Zn2+
::Na3As + 3 HBr → AsH3 + 3 NaBr

==Reactions==
The understanding of the chemical properties of AsH3 is well developed and can be anticipated based on an average of the behavior of pnictogen counterparts, such as PH3 and SbH3.

===Thermal decomposition===
Typical for a heavy hydride (e.g., , , ), is unstable with respect to its elements. In other words, it is stable kinetically but not thermodynamically.

This decomposition reaction is the basis of the Marsh test, which detects elemental As.

===Oxidation===
Continuing the analogy to SbH3, AsH3 is readily oxidized by concentrated O2 or the dilute O2 concentration in air:
::2 AsH3 + 3 O2 → As2O3 + 3 H2O

Arsine will react violently in presence of strong oxidizing agents, such as potassium permanganate, sodium hypochlorite, or nitric acid.

===Precursor to metallic derivatives===
AsH3 is used as a precursor to metal complexes of &quot;naked&quot; (or &quot;nearly naked&quot;) arsenic. An example is the dimanganese species [(C5H5)Mn(CO)2]2AsH, wherein the Mn2AsH core is planar.

===Gutzeit test===
A characteristic test for arsenic involves the reaction of AsH3 with Ag+, called the Gutzeit test for arsenic. Although this test has become obsolete in analytical chemistry, the underlying reactions further illustrate the affinity of AsH3 for &quot;soft&quot; metal cations. In the Gutzeit test, AsH3 is generated by reduction of aqueous arsenic compounds, typically arsenites, with Zn in the presence of H2SO4. The evolved gaseous AsH3 is then exposed to AgNO3 either as powder or as a solution. With solid AgNO3, AsH3 reacts to produce yellow Ag4AsNO3, whereas AsH3 reacts with a solution of AgNO3 to give black Ag3As.

===Acid-base reactions===
The acidic properties of the As–H bond are often exploited. Thus, AsH3 can be deprotonated:
::AsH3 + NaNH2 → NaAsH2 + NH3

Upon reaction with the aluminium trialkyls, AsH3 gives the trimeric [R2AlAsH2]3, where R = (CH3)3C. This reaction is relevant to the mechanism by which GaAs forms from AsH3 (see below).

AsH3 is generally considered non-basic, but it can be protonated by superacids to give isolable salts of the tetrahedral species [AsH4]+.

===Reaction with halogen compounds===
Reactions of arsine with the halogens (fluorine and chlorine) or some of their compounds, such as nitrogen trichloride, are extremely dangerous and can result in explosions.

===Catenation===
In contrast to the behavior of PH3, AsH3 does not form stable chains, although diarsine (or diarsane) H2As–AsH2, and even triarsane H2As–As(H)–AsH2 have been detected. The diarsine is unstable above −100 °C.

==Applications==

===Microelectronics applications===
AsH3 is used in the synthesis of semiconducting materials related to microelectronics and solid-state lasers. Related to phosphorus, arsenic is an n-dopant for silicon and germanium. More importantly, AsH3 is used to make the semiconductor GaAs by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at 700–900 °C:
::Ga(CH3)3 + AsH3 → GaAs + 3 CH4

For microelectronic applications, arsine can be provided by a sub-atmospheric gas source (a source that supplies less than atmospheric pressure). In this type of gas package, the arsine is adsorbed on a solid microporous adsorbent inside a gas cylinder. This method allows the gas to be stored without pressure, significantly reducing the risk of an arsine gas leak from the cylinder. With this apparatus, arsine is obtained by applying vacuum to the gas cylinder valve outlet. For semiconductor manufacturing, this method is feasible, as processes such as ion implantation operate under high vacuum.

===Chemical warfare===
Since before WWII AsH3 was proposed as a possible chemical warfare weapon. The gas is colorless, almost odorless, and 2.5 times denser than air, as required for a blanketing effect sought in chemical warfare. It is also lethal in concentrations far lower than those required to smell its garlic-like scent. In spite of these characteristics, arsine was never officially used as a weapon, because of its high flammability and its lower efficacy when compared to the non-flammable alternative phosgene. On the other hand, several organic compounds based on arsine, such as lewisite (β-chlorovinyldichloroarsine), adamsite (diphenylaminechloroarsine), Clark 1 (diphenylchloroarsine) and Clark 2 (diphenylcyanoarsine) have been effectively developed for use in chemical warfare.

==Forensic science and the Marsh test==

AsH3 is well known in forensic science because it is a chemical intermediate in the detection of arsenic poisoning. The old (but extremely sensitive) Marsh test generates AsH3 in the presence of arsenic. This procedure, published in 1836 by James Marsh, is based upon treating an As-containing sample of a victim&#x27;s body (typically the stomach contents) with As-free zinc and dilute sulfuric acid: if the sample contains arsenic, gaseous arsine will form. The gas is swept into a glass tube and decomposed by means of heating around 250–300 °C. The presence of As is indicated by formation of a deposit in the heated part of the equipment. On the other hand, the appearance of a black mirror deposit in the &quot;cool&quot; part of the equipment indicates the presence of antimony (the highly unstable SbH3 decomposes even at low temperatures).

The Marsh test was widely used by the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th; nowadays more sophisticated techniques such as atomic spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma, and x-ray fluorescence analysis are employed in the forensic field. Though neutron activation analysis was used to detect trace levels of arsenic in the mid 20th century, it has since fallen out of use in modern forensics.

==Toxicology==
The toxicity of arsine is distinct from that of other arsenic compounds. The main route of exposure is by inhalation, although poisoning after skin contact has also been described. Arsine attacks hemoglobin in the red blood cells, causing them to be destroyed by the body.

The first signs of exposure, which can take several hours to become apparent, are headaches, vertigo, and nausea, followed by the symptoms of haemolytic anaemia (high levels of unconjugated bilirubin), haemoglobinuria and nephropathy. In severe cases, the damage to the kidneys can be long-lasting.

Exposure to arsine concentrations of 250 ppm is rapidly fatal: concentrations of 25–30 ppm are fatal for 30 min exposure, and concentrations of 10 ppm can be fatal at longer exposure times. Symptoms of poisoning appear after exposure to concentrations of 0.5 ppm. There is little information on the chronic toxicity of arsine, although it is reasonable to assume that, in common with other arsenic compounds, a long-term exposure could lead to arsenicosis.

Arsine can cause pneumonia in two different ways either the &quot;extensive edema of the acute stage may become diffusely infiltrated with polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and the edema may change to ringed with leucocytes, their epithelium degenerated, their walls infiltrated, and each bronchiole the center of a small focus or nodule of pneumonic consolidation&quot;, and In the second Case &quot;the areas involved are practically always the anterior tips of the middle and upper lobes, while the posterior portions of these lobes and the whole of the lower lobes present an air-containing and emphysematous condition, sometimes with slight congestion, sometimes with none.&quot; which can result in death. 
It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

<text>The Universe in a Nutshell is a 2001 book about theoretical physics by Stephen Hawking. It is generally considered a sequel and was created to update the public concerning developments since the multi-million-copy bestseller &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; was published in 1988.

==Content==
In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor&#x27;s work, such as Gödel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics). He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to &quot;combine Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman&#x27;s idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.&quot;

==Awards==
The Universe in a Nutshell is winner of the Aventis Prizes for Science Books 2002.

<doc id="238527" wikidata="Q725979" url="?curid=238527" title="Elimination reaction">
<text>An elimination reaction is a type of organic reaction in which two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one- or two-step mechanism. The one-step mechanism is known as the E2 reaction, and the two-step mechanism is known as the E1 reaction. The numbers refer not to the number of steps in the mechanism, but rather to the kinetics of the reaction: E2 is bimolecular (second-order) while E1 is unimolecular (first-order). In cases where the molecule is able to stabilize an anion but possesses a poor leaving group, a third type of reaction, E1CB, exists. Finally, the pyrolysis of xanthate and acetate esters proceed through an &quot;internal&quot; elimination mechanism, the Ei mechanism.

== E2 mechanism ==
The E2 mechanism, where E2 stands for bimolecular elimination, involves a one-step mechanism in which &quot;carbon-hydrogen&quot; and &quot;carbon-halogen&quot; bonds break to form a double bond (&quot;C=C Pi bond&quot;).

The specifics of the reaction are as follows:
* E2 is a single step elimination, with a single transition state.
* It is typically undergone by primary substituted alkyl halides, but is possible with some secondary alkyl halides and other compounds.
* The reaction rate is second order, because it&#x27;s influenced by both the alkyl halide and the base (bimolecular).
* Because the E2 mechanism results in the formation of a pi bond, the two leaving groups (often a hydrogen and a halogen) need to be antiperiplanar. An antiperiplanar transition state has staggered conformation with lower energy than a synperiplanar transition state which is in eclipsed conformation with higher energy. The reaction mechanism involving staggered conformation is more favorable for E2 reactions (unlike E1 reactions).
* E2 typically uses a strong base. It must be strong enough to remove a weakly acidic hydrogen.
* In order for the pi bond to be created, the hybridization of carbons needs to be lowered from &quot;sp3&quot; to &quot;sp2&quot;.
* The C-H bond is weakened in the rate determining step and therefore a primary deuterium isotope effect much larger than 1 (commonly 2-6) is observed.
* E2 competes with the SN2 reaction mechanism if the base can also act as a nucleophile (true for many common bases).

An example of this type of reaction in &quot;scheme 1&quot; is the reaction of isobutylbromide with potassium ethoxide in ethanol. The reaction products are isobutene, ethanol and potassium bromide.

== E1 mechanism ==
E1 is a model to explain a particular type of chemical elimination reaction. E1 stands for unimolecular elimination and has the following specifications

* It is a two-step process of elimination: &quot;ionization and deprotonation&quot;.
** Ionization: the carbon-halogen bond breaks to give a carbocation intermediate.
** deprotonation of the carbocation.
* E1 typically takes place with tertiary alkyl halides, but is possible with some secondary alkyl halides.
* The reaction rate is influenced only by the concentration of the alkyl halide because carbocation formation is the slowest step, as known as the rate-determining step. Therefore, first-order kinetics apply (unimolecular).
* The reaction usually occurs in the complete absence of a base or the presence of only a weak base (acidic conditions and high temperature).
* E1 reactions are in competition with SN1 reactions because they share a common carbocationic intermediate.
* A secondary deuterium isotope effect of slightly larger than 1 (commonly 1 - 1.5) is observed.
* There is no antiperiplanar requirement. An example is the pyrolysis of a certain sulfonate ester of menthol:

:Only reaction product A results from antiperiplanar elimination. The presence of product B is an indication that an E1 mechanism is occurring.
* It is accompanied by carbocationic rearrangement reactions

An example in &quot;scheme 2&quot; is the reaction of tert-butylbromide with potassium ethoxide in ethanol.

E1 eliminations happen with highly substituted alkyl halides for two main reasons.
* Highly substituted alkyl halides are bulky, limiting the room for the E2 one-step mechanism; therefore, the two-step E1 mechanism is favored.
* Highly substituted carbocations are more stable than methyl or primary substituted cations. Such stability gives time for the two-step E1 mechanism to occur.
If SN1 and E1 pathways are competing, the E1 pathway can be favored by increasing the heat. 

Specific features : 
# Rearrangement possible
# Independent of concentration and basicity of base

== Competition among mechanisms ==
The reaction rate is influenced by the reactivity of halogens, iodide and bromide being favored. Fluoride is not a good leaving group, so eliminations with fluoride as the leaving group have slower rates than other halogens .
There is a certain level of competition between the elimination reaction and nucleophilic substitution. More precisely, there are competitions between E2 and SN2 and also between E1 and SN1. Generally, elimination is favored over substitution when
* steric hindrance around the α-carbon increases.
* a stronger base is used.
* temperature increases (increase entropy)
* the base is a poor nucleophile. Bases with steric bulk, (such as in potassium tert-butoxide), are often poor nucleophiles.
For example, when a 3° haloalkane is reacts with an alkoxide, due to strong basic character of the alkoxide and unreactivity of 3° group towards SN2, only alkene formation by E2 elimination is observed. Thus, elimination by E2 limits the scope of the Williamson ether synthesis (an SN2 reaction) to essentially only 1° haloalkanes; 2° haloalkanes generally do not give synthetically useful yields, while 3° haloalkanes fail completely. 

With strong base, 3° haloalkanes give elimination by E2. With weak bases, mixtures of elimination and substitution products form by competing SN1 and E1 pathways. 

The case of 2° haloalkanes is relatively complex. For strongly basic nucleophiles (p&quot;K&quot;aH &gt; 11, e.g., hydroxide, alkoxide, acetylide), the result is generally elimination by E2, while weaker bases that are still good nucleophiles (e.g., acetate, azide, cyanide, iodide) will give primarily SN2. Finally, weakly nucleophilic species (e.g., water, alcohols, carboxylic acids) will give a mixture of SN1 and E1.

For 1° haloalkanes with β-branching, E2 elimination is still generally preferred over SN2 for strongly basic nucleophiles. Unhindered 1° haloalkanes favor SN2 when the nucleophile is also unhindered. However, strongly basic and hindered nucleophiles favor E2. 

In general, with the exception of reactions in which E2 is impossible because β hydrogens are unavailable (e.g. methyl, allyl, and benzyl halides), clean SN2 substitution is hard to achieve when strong bases are used, as alkene products arising from elimination are almost always observed to some degree. On the other hand, clean E2 can be achieved by simply selecting a sterically hindered base (e.g., potassium &quot;tert&quot;-butoxide). Similarly, attempts to effect substitution by SN1 almost always result in a product mixture contaminated by some E1 product (again, with the exception of cases where the lack of β hydrogens makes elimination impossible).

In one study the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) was determined for the gas phase reaction of several alkyl halides with the chlorate ion. In accordance with an E2 elimination the reaction with t-butyl chloride results in a KIE of 2.3. The methyl chloride reaction (only SN2 possible) on the other hand has a KIE of 0.85 consistent with a SN2 reaction because in this reaction type the C-H bonds tighten in the transition state. The KIE&#x27;s for the ethyl (0.99) and isopropyl (1.72) analogues suggest competition between the two reaction modes.

== Elimination reactions other than β-elimination ==
β-Elimination, with loss of electrofuge and nucleofuge on vicinal carbon atoms, is by far the most common type of elimination. The ability to form a stable product containing a C=C or C=X bond, as well as orbital alignment considerations, strongly favors β-elimination over other elimination processes. However, other types are known, generally for systems where β-elimination cannot occur.
The next most common type of elimination reaction is α-elimination. For a carbon center, the result of α-elimination is the formation of a carbene, which includes &quot;stable carbenes&quot; such as carbon monoxide or isocyanides. For instance, α-elimination the elements of HCl from chloroform (CHCl3) in the presence of strong base is a classic approach for the generation of dichlorocarbene, :CCl2, as a reactive intermediate. On the other hand, formic acid undergoes α-elimination to afford the stable products water and carbon monoxide under acidic conditions. α-Elimination may also occur on a metal center, one particularly common result of which is lowering of both the metal oxidation state and coordination number by 2 units in a process known as reductive elimination. (Confusingly, in organometallic terminology, the terms &quot;α-elimination&quot; and &quot;α-abstraction&quot; refer to processes that result in formation of a metal-carbene complex. In these reactions, it is the carbon adjacent to the metal that undergoes α-elimination.)

In certain special cases, γ- and higher eliminations to form three-membered or larger rings is also possible in both organic and organometallic processes. For instance, certain Pt(II) complexes undergo γ- and δ-elimination to give metallocycles. More recently, γ-silyl elimination of a silylcyclobutyl tosylate has been used to prepare strained bicyclic systems.

==History==
Many of the concepts and terminology related to elimination reactions were proposed by Christopher Kelk Ingold in the 1920s.

<doc id="238528" wikidata="Q207895" url="?curid=238528" title="Nitrogen dioxide">
<text>Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula . One of several nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown gas. It is a paramagnetic, bent molecule with C2v point group symmetry. Industrially, is an intermediate in the synthesis of nitric acid, millions of tons of which are produced each year, primarily for the production of fertilizers. 

Nitrogen dioxide is poisonous and can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities. Cooking with a gas stove produces nitrogen dioxide which causes poorer indoor air quality. Combustion of gas can lead to increased concentrations of nitrogen dioxide throughout the home environment which is linked to respiratory issues and diseases. The LC50 (median lethal dose) for humans has been estimated to be 174 ppm for a 1-hour exposure. It is also included in the NOx family of atmospheric pollutants.

==Properties ==
Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown gas with a pungent, acrid odor above and becomes a yellowish-brown liquid below . It forms an equilibrium with its dimer, dinitrogen tetroxide (), and converts almost entirely to below .

The bond length between the nitrogen atom and the oxygen atom is 119.7 pm. This bond length is consistent with a bond order between one and two.

Unlike ozone () the ground electronic state of nitrogen dioxide is a doublet state, since nitrogen has one unpaired electron, which decreases the alpha effect compared with nitrite and creates a weak bonding interaction with the oxygen lone pairs. The lone electron in also means that this compound is a free radical, so the formula for nitrogen dioxide is often written as .

The reddish-brown color is a consequence of preferential absorption of light in the blue region of the spectrum (400–500 nm), although the absorption extends throughout the visible (at shorter wavelengths) and into the infrared (at longer wavelengths). Absorption of light at wavelengths shorter than about 400 nm results in photolysis (to form , atomic oxygen); in the atmosphere the addition of the oxygen atom so formed to results in ozone.

==Preparation==

Industrially, nitrogen dioxide is produced and transported as its cryogenic liquid dimer, dinitrogen tetroxide. It is produced industrially by the oxidation of ammonia, the Ostwald Process. This reaction is the first step in the production of nitric acid:
It can also be produced by the oxidation of nitrosyl chloride:

Instead, most laboratory syntheses stabilize and then heat the nitric acid to accelerate the decomposition. For example, the thermal decomposition of some metal nitrates generates :
Alternatively, dehydration of nitric acid produces nitronium nitrate...
:  
...which subsequently undergoes thermal decomposition:

 is generated by the reduction of concentrated nitric acid with a metal (such as copper):

==Selected reactions==
Nitric acid decomposes slowly to nitrogen dioxide by the overall reaction:
:4 → 4 + 2 + 
The nitrogen dioxide so formed confers the characteristic yellow color often exhibited by this acid. However, the reaction is too slow to be a practical source of . 

===Thermal properties===
At low temperatures, reversibly converts to the colourless gas dinitrogen tetroxide ():

The exothermic equilibrium has enthalpy change . 

At , decomposes with release of oxygen via an endothermic process ():
:2 NO2 →2 NO +  

===As an oxidizer ===
As suggested by the weakness of the N–O bond, is a good oxidizer. Consequently, it will combust, sometimes explosively, in the presence of hydrocarbons.

===Hydrolysis===
NO2 reacts with water to give nitric acid and nitrous acid:

This reaction is one of the steps in the Ostwald process for the industrial production of nitric acid from ammonia. This reaction is negligibly slow at low concentrations of NO2 characteristic of the ambient atmosphere, although it does proceed upon NO2 uptake to surfaces. Such surface reaction is thought to produce gaseous HNO2 (often written as HONO) in outdoor and indoor environments.

===Conversion to nitrates===
 is used to generate anhydrous metal nitrates from the oxides:

Alkyl and metal iodides give the corresponding nitrates:

===With organic compounds===
The reactivity of nitrogen dioxide toward organic compounds has long been known. For example, it reacts with amides to give N-nitroso derivatives. It is used for nitrations under anhydrous conditions.

==Uses==
 is used as an intermediate in the manufacturing of nitric acid, as a nitrating agent in the manufacturing of chemical explosives, as a polymerization inhibitor for acrylates, as a flour bleaching agent, and as a room temperature sterilization agent. It is also used as an oxidizer in rocket fuel, for example in red fuming nitric acid; it was used in the Titan rockets, to launch Project Gemini, in the maneuvering thrusters of the Space Shuttle, and in uncrewed space probes sent to various planets.

==Environmental presence==

Nitrogen dioxide typically arises via the oxidation of nitric oxide by oxygen in air (e.g. as result of corona discharge):

:2 

 is introduced into the environment by natural causes, including entry from the stratosphere, bacterial respiration, volcanos, and lightning. These sources make a trace gas in the atmosphere of Earth, where it plays a role in absorbing sunlight and regulating the chemistry of the troposphere, especially in determining ozone concentrations.

=== Anthropogenic sources ===

Nitrogen dioxide also forms in most combustion processes. At elevated temperatures nitrogen combines with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide:
For the general public, the most prominent sources of are internal combustion engines, as combustion temperatures are high enough to thermally combine some of the nitrogen and oxygen in the air to form . Nitrogen dioxide accounts for a small fraction (generally well under 0.1) of NOx auto emissions. 

Outdoors, can be a result of traffic from motor vehicles. Indoors, exposure arises from cigarette smoke, and butane and kerosene heaters and stoves. Indoor exposure levels of are, on average, at least three times higher in homes with gas stoves compared to electric stove. Workers in industries where is used are also exposed and are at risk for occupational lung diseases, and NIOSH has set exposure limits and safety standards. Workers in high voltage areas especially those with spark or plasma creation are at risk. Agricultural workers can be exposed to arising from grain decomposing in silos; chronic exposure can lead to lung damage in a condition called &quot;silo-filler&#x27;s disease&quot;.

==Toxicity==
 diffuses into the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the respiratory epithelium and dissolves. There, it chemically reacts with antioxidant and lipid molecules in the ELF. The health effects of are caused by the reaction products or their metabolites, which are reactive nitrogen species and reactive oxygen species that can drive bronchoconstriction, inflammation, reduced immune response, and may have effects on the heart.

=== Acute exposure ===
Acute harm due to exposure is rare. 100–200 ppm can cause mild irritation of the nose and throat, 250–500 ppm can cause edema, leading to bronchitis or pneumonia, and levels above 1000 ppm can cause death due to asphyxiation from fluid in the lungs. There are often no symptoms at the time of exposure other than transient cough, fatigue or nausea, but over hours inflammation in the lungs causes edema.

For skin or eye exposure, the affected area is flushed with saline. For inhalation, oxygen is administered, bronchodilators may be administered, and if there are signs of methemoglobinemia, a condition that arises when nitrogen-based compounds affect the hemoglobin in red blood cells, methylene blue may be administered.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and it is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

=== Long-term ===
Exposure to low levels of over time can cause changes in lung function. Cooking with a gas stove is associated with poorer indoor air quality. Combustion of gas can lead to increased concentrations of nitrogen dioxide throughout the home environment which is linked to respiratory issues and diseases. Children exposed to are more likely to be admitted to hospital with asthma.

In 2019, the Court of Justice of the EU, found that France did not comply with the limit values of the EU air quality standards applicable to the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 12 air quality zones.

== Environmental effects ==
Interaction of and other with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere can form acid rain which harms sensitive ecosystems such as lakes and forests. Elevated levels of can also harm vegetation, decreasing growth, and reduce crop yields.

<text>Lonesome Dove is a 1985 Western novel by American writer Larry McMurtry. It is the first published book of the &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; series and the third installment in the series chronologically. 
It was a bestseller and won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In 1989, it was adapted as a TV miniseries starring Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall, which won both critical and popular acclaim. McMurtry went on to write a sequel, &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; (1993), and two prequels, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1995) and &quot;Comanche Moon&quot; (1997), all of which were also adapted as TV series.
==Premise==
The novel, set in the waning days of the Old West centers on the relationships between several retired Texas Rangers and their adventures driving a cattle herd from Texas to Montana. The novel contains themes including old age, death, unrequited love, and friendship.

==Plot==
In the late 1870s, Captain Woodrow F. Call and Captain Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; McCrae, two famous retired Texas Rangers, run the Hat Creek Cattle Company and Livery Emporium in the small Texas border town of Lonesome Dove. Working with them are Joshua Deets, an excellent tracker and scout from their Ranger days; Pea Eye Parker, another former Ranger who is loyal and reliable, but unintelligent; Bolivar, a retired Mexican bandit who works as their cook; and Newt Dobbs, a 17-year-old boy whose mother was a prostitute named Maggie and whose father is widely thought by the outfit to be Call, though Call has never acknowledged this.

Jake Spoon, another former Ranger, arrives in Lonesome Dove after an absence of more than 10 years, during which he has traveled widely across the United States. He reveals that he is on the run, having accidentally shot a dentist in Fort Smith, Arkansas. The dentist&#x27;s brother happened to be the town&#x27;s sheriff, July Johnson.

Reunited with Gus and Call, Jake&#x27;s description of the Montana Territory inspires Call to gather a herd of cattle and drive them north, to begin the first cattle ranch north of the Yellowstone River. Call, who has grown listless in retirement, is attracted to the romantic notion of settling pristine country. Gus is less enthusiastic, but changes his mind when reminded that the love of his life, Clara, lives on the Platte River near Ogallala, Nebraska, which would be on the route to Montana. The Hat Creek outfit rustles thousands of cattle from across the border in Mexico and recruits local cowboys in preparation for the drive.

Ironically, Jake Spoon soon decides not to go at all, having made himself comfortable with the town&#x27;s only prostitute, Lorena Wood, who is smitten with him after he promises to take her to San Francisco. At Lorena&#x27;s insistence, however, she and Jake ultimately trail along behind the cattle drive.

In Fort Smith, the young and inexperienced sheriff, 24-year-old July Johnson, reluctantly departs town on the trail of Jake Spoon, taking his 12-year-old stepson Joe with him, and leaving the inept deputy sheriff Roscoe Brown in charge. July&#x27;s wife Elmira, who regrets her recent marriage to him, leaves shortly afterwards to search for her former lover . Roscoe is sent after July to inform him of her disappearance, and has many misadventures and strange encounters through Arkansas and Texas, assisted by a young girl named Janey, who escapes from sexual slavery to accompany him. Roscoe eventually reunites with July and Joe when they rescue him and Janey from bandits in Texas.

As the cattle drive moves north through Texas, the Hat Creek company encounters dust storms, dangerous river crossings, and many other adventures. Jake tires of Lorena and abandons her to go gambling in Austin. Left alone, she is abducted by an Indian bandit named Blue Duck, a notorious and mercilessly vicious old nemesis of the Texas Rangers. Gus goes in pursuit, and while traveling along the Canadian River, he encounters July&#x27;s group. Gus and July attack Blue Duck&#x27;s bandit encampment, killing the bandits and rescuing Lorena; however, Blue Duck has already made his escape, having murdered Roscoe, Joe, and Janey in the process. A devastated July continues his journey in search of Elmira, while Gus and Lorena return to the cattle drive. Lorena has been repeatedly raped, and, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, is frightened of interacting with anybody other than Gus. The two still follow the cattle drive north, and sleep in a tent some distance behind the other cowboys.

Meanwhile, Jake Spoon is in Fort Worth. Hearing that July Johnson has been looking for him, Jake leaves Texas in a hurry in the company of the Suggs brothers, who are, he soon realizes, cruel bandits. Jake becomes increasingly alarmed by the brothers&#x27; actions as they travel north into Kansas; the gang progresses from robbery to cold-blooded murder, but Jake is too frightened and outnumbered to either kill them or escape. When the gang attacks a trail boss known to Gus and Call, the former Rangers of the Hat Creek outfit go in pursuit of them. The ex-Rangers are dismayed when they apprehend the Suggs brothers and find Jake alongside them. Jake pleads with his former comrades that he had no choice but to go along with things for fear of his own life, but Gus and Call stand firm that he has &quot;crossed a line&quot;, and they solemnly hang him alongside the Suggs brothers. Newt, who had idolized Jake as a child, is left deeply upset.

Meanwhile, Elmira, pregnant with July&#x27;s child, has come into the company of a rough buffalo hunter named Zwey, a simple man who seems to believe he is now &quot;married&quot; to her. Arriving in Nebraska, they come across the horse ranch of Clara Allen, Gus&#x27; former lover, whose husband, Bob, has become a brain-damaged invalid after being kicked in the head by a mustang. Clara delivers Elmira&#x27;s baby son, but Elmira and Zwey leave almost immediately afterwards for Ogallala.

Dee Boot is held in the Ogallala jail, scheduled to be hanged for his accidental murder of a young boy; Elmira collapses while speaking to him, and Boot is hanged while she recuperates in a doctor&#x27;s house, leaving her heartbroken and depressed. July arrives at Clara&#x27;s ranch, learns what has transpired, and goes to see Elmira, but she refuses to speak to him. Shortly afterwards, she orders Zwey to take her east, back towards St. Louis. Anguished and heartbroken, July feels compelled to follow her, but at Clara&#x27;s insistence, he remains at the ranch with her family and his son, instead, whom Clara has named Martin. Word later reaches them that Elmira and Zwey were killed by Sioux.

The Hat Creek outfit arrives in Nebraska, and Gus takes Lorena, Call, and Newt to visit Clara. Lorena, who has fallen in love with Gus, fears that Gus will abandon her for Clara. Clara is happy to see Gus, but has no desire to rekindle their romance; however, she takes in Lorena, whose post-traumatic stress is easing and who quickly feels comfortable with Clara and her daughters. Gus, rebuffed by Clara and no longer Lorena&#x27;s sole caretaker, decides to continue on the cattle drive and see the journey to Montana through to its end.

In Wyoming, several horses are stolen by half-starved Indians. Call, Gus, and Deets chase after them, and Deets is killed in the ensuing confrontation by the group&#x27;s only remaining brave. Shortly afterward, Gus informs Newt that Call is his father, something Newt has always dreamed of, but he is too upset by Deets&#x27; death to give it much thought.

After a desperate crossing through the arid basins of Wyoming, the cattle drive arrives in Montana, which proves as lush and beautiful as Jake had described. Scouting ahead of the main herd, Gus and Pea Eye are attacked by Blood Indians, and Gus is badly wounded by two arrows to the leg. Besieged in a makeshift dugout in the bank of the Musselshell River for several days, Gus&#x27; wounds become infected, and his health declines. After a heavy rain, he sends Pea Eye down the swollen river to seek help, but Pea Eye loses his clothing, boots, gun, and food in the river and stumbles naked and unarmed for a 100-mile walk across the plains. Starving, delirious, and suffering from exposure, he is discovered by the rest of the cowboys on the verge of death. Call then sets out alone to rescue Gus.

Meanwhile, feverish and dying, Gus leaves the river shortly after Pea Eye, taking his chances and escaping the Indians. He makes it to Miles City, Montana, and collapses unconscious, waking to find that a doctor has sawed off his gangrenous leg. His other leg is also infected, but Gus refuses to let the doctor amputate it. Call arrives in Miles City and fruitlessly tries to convince Gus to have his other leg removed to save his life; Gus, however, would rather die than be an invalid. Gus asks Call to bury him in an orchard in Texas where he used to picnic with Clara, and Call begrudgingly agrees. After writing letters to Clara and Lorena, and urging Call to accept Newt as his son, Gus dies of blood poisoning. Call leaves Gus&#x27; body in storage in Miles City, intending to return him to Texas after the winter. He continues north with the cattle drive, despondent over losing his closest friend.

Eventually, the remaining members of the Hat Creek outfit establish a ranch in the fertile and ungrazed wilderness between the Missouri River and the Milk River. Call suffers from depression all winter, no longer caring about the cattle drive or the ranch, and contemplating what to do about Newt. Before leaving in the spring, he puts Newt in charge of the ranch and gives him his horse, his rifle, and his family watch, but still cannot bring himself to publicly acknowledge the boy as his son. Newt is inwardly upset, but accepts the gifts, nonetheless. Call, ashamed of himself, leaves the ranch.

Call retrieves Gus&#x27;s body, packed in a coffin with salt and charcoal, and begins the long journey south in an old buggy. In Nebraska, he gives Gus&#x27; letters to Clara and Lorena, and explains that Gus has left his half of the cattle interests to Lorena. Lorena is devastated by Gus&#x27; death and refuses to open her letter; standing silently by his coffin day and night, she suddenly faints. Clara considers the journey a whimsical folly typical of Gus and urges Call to bury him on her ranch, instead, but Call refuses, having given Gus his word. Clara tells Call she despises him as a &quot;vain coward&quot; for refusing to claim Newt as his son, and he leaves Nebraska haunted by her condemnation.

The story of the cowboy transporting his dead friend&#x27;s body spreads across the plains, and Call takes a circuitous route through Colorado and New Mexico to avoid the increasing attention. In Santa Rosa, he discovers that Blue Duck has been captured by a sheriff&#x27;s deputy and is about to be hanged. Call visits Blue Duck in his jail cell, and Blue Duck taunts him, pointing out that he raided, killed, raped, and kidnapped with impunity throughout his life, despite the best efforts of the Texas Rangers. On the day of his hanging, on his way to the roof where the gallows await him, Blue Duck jumps out a third-story window, pulling along with him the sheriff&#x27;s deputy who had caught him, killing them both.

Arriving back in Texas exhausted, despondent, and wounded from a bullet to his side, Call buries Gus by the spring in the orchard near San Antonio, true to his word. He then rides on to Lonesome Dove, where the cook Bolivar, who had abandoned the cattle drive before it left Texas, is delighted to see him again. In town, Call finds that the saloon has burned down; the proprietor, who had been madly in love with Lorena, committed suicide after her departure by burning down his saloon while he remained inside.

==Characters==
* Captain Woodrow F. Call – A co-owner of the Hat Creek outfit and former Texas Ranger, he is a largely silent leader of men and tireless worker who believes firmly in discipline, duty, and honor; he is a foil to his best friend Gus. In his preface, McMurtry describes Call as a Stoic.
* Captain Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; McCrae – A co-owner of the Hat Creek outfit and former Texas Ranger, he is a lazy, loquacious, and charismatic rake with a fondness for alcohol, gambling, and whores; he is nonetheless a brave and competent fighter when required. He is tall and lanky, famed for his excellent eyesight, and has had silver hair since he was 30. He serves as a foil to his best friend, Call, and is described by McMurtry as an Epicurean.
* Pea Eye Parker – The wrangler and blacksmith of the Hat Creek Cattle Company, Pea Eye served as a corporal in the Rangers under Gus and Call. Pea Eye (his real first name long forgotten) is not especially bright, but he is brave, reliable, and kind. He follows Call&#x27;s lead without question.
* Joshua Deets – An African-American former Ranger, Deets is a loyal ranch hand, and on the drive serves as the chief scout. He is an exceptional tracker who relies on his phenomenal instincts to lead the company out of harm&#x27;s way. He is quiet and contemplative, but wise, compassionate, and trusted by all.
* Newt Dobbs – A 17-year-old orphan, he was raised by Gus and Call. His mother was a prostitute named Maggie, who died when he was a child. He knows his mother was a prostitute, but has no idea who his father might be. Most observers, notably Gus and Clara Allen, are confident Call is his father. Though he begins the journey awkward and inexperienced, Newt develops into a competent and reliable cowboy, and despite his young age, is eventually given leadership of the ranch in Call&#x27;s absence. In his preface, McMurtry refers to Newt as &quot;the lonesome dove of the title.&quot;
* Jake Spoon – A former Ranger, he left his friends 10 years ago to travel around America, returning to Texas near the beginning of the novel. Like Gus, Jake is a drinker, gambler, and womanizer. He possesses a great personal charm, but is lazy, selfish, and often careless.
* Dishwater &quot;Dish&quot; Boggett – Though only 22, Dish is a cowboy of great skill and the &quot;top hand&quot; for Call&#x27;s cattle drive. He suffers greatly from unrequited love for Lorena Wood. His nickname derives from once having drunk dishwater on a cattle drive, being so thirsty that he could not wait for the water barrel.
* Bolivar – A former Mexican bandit and the cook for the Hat Creek Cattle Company, he is obsessed with loudly and unnecessarily ringing the dinner bell to call the company for dinner. Bolivar is uneasy about venturing far from the Rio Grande and abandons the cattle drive before it leaves Texas.
* Po Campo – The cattle drive&#x27;s enigmatic new cook, he was hired by Call in San Antonio after Bolivar&#x27;s departure. He uses exotic ingredients such as grasshoppers in his meals and refuses to ride animals. He hints at being well-traveled, and also offhandedly remarks that he killed his wife.
* Lorena Wood – A beautiful young woman from Alabama, she was coerced into prostitution by a former lover, later washing up in Lonesome Dove, where she works as the town&#x27;s only whore. Lorena is taciturn, strong-willed, and often intimidating to the numerous cowboys who seek her affection, generally viewing her clients and admirers with contempt. Discontented with her life, Lorena initially harbors a dream of traveling to San Francisco, but her perspective changes dramatically after her experiences during the cattle drive.
* Blue Duck – The son of Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump and his Mexican captive, Blue Duck leads a gang of renegade Indians and Caucasian criminals. Atrociously wicked and remorseless, he is feared across the plains as a ruthless murderer, rapist, and slaver. He has managed to evade the law even as the West gradually grows safer and more civilized.
* July Johnson – The sheriff of the town of Fort Smith, Arkansas, July is a kind young man recently married to Elmira, whom he deeply loves despite her being openly disdainful of him. After his brother Ben is accidentally killed by Jake Spoon, July sets off in pursuit of him.
*Elmira Johnson – A former whore from Kansas, she recently married July Johnson. She is unhappy with her life and suffers from depression, eventually leaving Fort Smith to seek out her old love Dee Boot.
* Roscoe Brown – The deputy sheriff of Fort Smith, Arkansas, Roscoe is a simple man in his 40s who is content to spend his life minding the sleepy town&#x27;s jail, but is bullied by July&#x27;s sister-in-law into tracking down the sheriff and his missing wife.
* Joe – Elmira&#x27;s son, he travels with July to find and arrest Jake Spoon.
* Janey – A young girl whom Roscoe meets on his journey to find July, she was a slave to an old man living alone in the woods, but when Roscoe arrives, she escapes from captivity and travels with him, proving herself useful with her ability to catch animals to eat and her excellent aim when throwing rocks.
* Clara Allen – Gus&#x27; former love, she declined his repeated marriage proposals during their youth in Texas – for reasons that were never entirely clear to Gus – instead marrying the horse trader Bob Allen and moving to a ranch near Ogallala, Nebraska. She still grieves for her sons who died of respiratory disease from the sod house in which Bob and she first lived, and treasures her daughters.
* Jimmy and Ben Rainey, Bill and Pete Spettle, Soupy Jones, Needle Nelson, Jasper Fant, Bert Borum, Lippy Jones, Sean and Allen O&#x27;Brien – These other hands were hired by Call to work the cattle drive.

==Reception==
&quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; was the winner of the 1986 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, and received favorable reviews. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Nicholas Lemann praised the novel as &quot;thrilling and almost perfectly realized,&quot; calling it &quot;the great cowboy novel.&quot; 

McMurtry himself eventually expressed dissatisfaction with the popularity of the novel, particularly after the miniseries adaptation. In the preface to the 2000 edition, he wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to go wrong if one writes at length about the Old West, still the phantom leg of the American psyche. I thought I had written about a harsh time and some pretty harsh people, but to the public at large, I had produced something nearer to an idealization; instead of a poor man&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, filled with violence, faithlessness and betrayal, I had actually delivered a kind of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; of the West, a turnabout I&#x27;ll be mulling over for a long, long time.&quot;

Assessing the novel&#x27;s cultural legacy in 2019, Nasrullah Mambrol was more sympathetic than the author&#x27;s self-assessment. &quot;What McMurtry did was to reinvent the Western novel by taking its basic elements and elevating them to the level of epic.&quot; He reached &quot;the height of his powers&quot; with &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;.

==Adaptation==

A television miniseries adaptation produced by Motown Productions was broadcast on CBS in 1989, starring Robert Duvall as Augustus McCrae and Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow F. Call. The series was a commercial and critical success.

==Historical references==
According to McMurtry, Gus and Call were not modeled after historical characters, but similarities exist with real-life cattle drivers Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving. When Goodnight and Loving&#x27;s African American guide Bose Ikard died, Goodnight carved a wooden grave marker for him, just as Call does for Deets. Upon Loving&#x27;s death, Goodnight brought him home to be buried in Texas, as Call does for Augustus. (Goodnight himself appears as a minor but generally sympathetic character in this novel, and more so in the sequel, &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;, and the prequels &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot; and &quot;Comanche Moon&quot;.) Blue Duck also was a historical person, a paramour of Belle Starr, &quot;Queen of the Oklahoma Outlaws&quot;.

According to McMurtry&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Books: A Memoir&quot;, the ultimate sources for Gus and Call were Don Quixote, the crazy old knight, and Sancho Panza, the peasant pragmatist, from &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. He stated: &quot;What is important that, early on, I read some version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and pondered the grave differences (comically cast) between Sancho and the Don. Between the two is where fiction, as I&#x27;ve mostly read and written it, lives.&quot;

Other books of the &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; series feature other prominent historical events and locations such as the Texan Santa Fe Expedition, the Great Raid of 1840, and the King Ranch, and characters such as Buffalo Hump, John Wesley Hardin, and Judge Roy Bean.

<text>Stefan Dragutin (, ; 1244 – 12 March 1316), was King of Serbia from 1276 to 1282. From 1282, he ruled a separate kingdom which included northern Serbia, and (from 1284) the neighboring Hungarian banates (or border provinces), for which he was unofficially styled &quot;King of Syrmia&quot;. 

He was the eldest son of King Stefan Uroš I of Serbia and Queen Helen. Dragutin married Catherine of Hungary, likely after his father concluded a peace treaty with her grandfather, Béla IV of Hungary, in 1268. By 1271, he received the title of &quot;young king&quot; in recognition of his right to succeed his father. He rebelled against his father, and with Hungarian assistance, forced him to abdicate in 1276.

Dragutin abandoned Uroš I&#x27;s centralizing policy and ceded large territories to his mother in appanage. After a riding accident, he abdicated in favor of his brother Milutin in 1282, but retained the northern regions of Serbia along the Hungarian border. Two years later, his brother-in-law, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, granted him three banates—Mačva (or &quot;Sirmia ulterior&quot;), Usora and Soli. He was the first Serbian monarch to rule Belgrade. With his brother&#x27;s support, he also occupied the Banate of Braničevo in 1284 or 1285.

In theory, Dragutin was a vassal both to his brother (for his Serbian territories), and to the Hungarian monarchs (for the four banates), but in practice he ruled his realm as an independent ruler from the 1290s. His conflicts with Milutin developed into open war in 1301, and he frequently raided the neighboring Hungarian lords from 1307. Most of the Serbian noblemen supported Dragutin, but he was forced to make peace with Milutin after Milutin&#x27;s mercenaries routed him in 1311 or 1312. Before his death, he entered a monastery and died as the monk taking the name of Theoctistus, the fifth century Byzantine saint. On the list of Serbian saints, Dragutin is venerated on 12 November or 30 October (Old Style and New Style dates).

== Early life ==

Dragutin was the eldest son of King Stefan Uroš I of Serbia, and Helen of Anjou. The place and date of his birth are unknown. In 1264, the monk Domentijan recorded that the &quot;fourth generation&quot; of the descendants of Stefan Nemanja was already old enough &quot;to ride a horse and carry a warrior&#x27;s lance&quot;. As Domentijan is obviously referring to Dragutin, the historian Miodrag Purković concluded Dragutin must have been twenty and dated his birth to around 1244.

The date of Dragutin&#x27;s marriage with Catherine of Hungary is also unknown. His father and her grandfather, Béla IV of Hungary, most probably arranged the marriage during the peace negotiations that followed Uroš I&#x27;s invasion of Mačva in 1268, but an earlier date cannot be excluded. Mačva was a Hungarian border province to the north of Serbia which had been governed by Béla IV&#x27;s daughter, Anna, on behalf of her minor son, Béla. Uroš I launched a plundering raid against the province, but he was captured and forced to seek a reconciliation. Catherine&#x27;s father, Stephen V, had been bearing the title of &quot;younger king&quot; as his father&#x27;s co-ruler and heir and the same title was bestowed on Dragutin in recognition of his exclusive right to inherit Serbia from his father. The Peace of Pressburg between Stephen V and King Ottokar II of Bohemia is the oldest extant document which describes Dragutin as a &quot;younger king&quot;.

Decades later, Danilo II, Archbishop of Serbia, recorded that Dragutin&#x27;s Hungarian in-laws also expected that Uroš would cede parts of his realm to Dragutin to allow him to rule them independently. The peace agreement may have explicitly prescribed the division of Serbia between Uroš I and Dragutin, according to Aleksandar Krstić and other historians. After spending years strengthening his central government, Uroš was reluctant to divide his kingdom with his son. Dragutin and his wife were living in his father&#x27;s court when a Byzantine envoy visited Serbia in the late 1260s.

Dragutin rose up against his father in 1276. Whether he wanted to persuade his father to share power with him, or he was afraid of being disinherited in favor of his younger brother, Milutin, cannot be determined. Dragutin&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, sent Hungarian and Cuman troops to Serbia to assist him. Dragutin routed his father near Gacko in the autumn of 1276. Uroš abdicated without further resistance and entered the Sopoćani Monastery where he died a year later.

== Reign ==

=== Serbia ===

The archbishop of Serbia, Joanikije I, abdicated after the fall of Uroš I. His abdication may have been to protest Dragutin&#x27;s usurpation of the throne, or he may have been forced to resign because of his close relationship with the dethroned monarch. Soon after ascending the throne, Dragutin gave large parts of Serbia—including Zeta, Trebinje and other coastal territories, and Plav—to his mother in appanage. The lands of Helen&#x27;s appanage included the core territories of the former Kingdom of Duklja and developed into a province of the heirs to the Serbian throne after her death. Milutin accompanied their mother to her realm and settled in Shkodër.

Serbia&#x27;s relationship with the Republic of Ragusa had been tense during the last years of Uroš I&#x27;s reign, although his wife secretly supported the republic. Dragutin reconciled shortly after he had ascended the throne. Charles I of Anjou, King of Sicily, wanted to include Dragutin in a coalition against the Byzantine Empire. The two kings exchanged letters about this issue in 1279.

Dragutin fell off his horse and broke his leg in early 1282. His injury was so severe a council was called in Deževo to make decisions about governing Serbia. At the council, Dragutin abdicated in favor of Milutin, but the circumstances of his abdication are uncertain. Decades later, Dragutin recounted that he had already come into conflict with Milutin, and that he had ceded the government to Milutin only provisionally, until he recovered. Archbishop Danilo II wrote that Dragutin abdicated because he regarded the riding accident as God&#x27;s punishment for his acts against his father, but the Archbishop also referred to unspecified &quot;serious troubles&quot; that contributed to Dragutin&#x27;s decision. The Byzantine historian, George Pachymeres, was informed that Dragutin&#x27;s abdication had been definitive, but Pachymeres also mentioned an agreement between the two brothers that secured the right of Dragutin&#x27;s (unnamed) son to succeed Milutin.

=== &quot;Sirmia ulterior&quot; ===

Inscriptions on frescos and diplomatic correspondence provide evidence that Dragutin was styled &quot;king&quot; after his abdication, but Milutin&#x27;s supreme position is evident. Dragutin continued to style himself as king in his charters and on his coins. Dragutin and Milutin wore royal insignias seen on a fresco in St. Achillius Church, which was Dragutin&#x27;s endowment near Arilje, but Dragutin is depicted with fewer royal emblems. Actually, Serbia was divided between Dragutin and Milutin at Dragutin&#x27;s abdication, with Dragutin retaining the northern region along the Hungarian border, including the recently opened silver mine at Rudnik. He also held territories in western Serbia on the river Lim, thus he was his brother&#x27;s most powerful vassal. Ladislaus IV of Hungary granted Mačva, Usora and Soli to Dragutin in the second half of 1284. Relatives of the Hungarian monarchs, most recently Dragutin&#x27;s mother-in-law, Elizabeth the Cuman, had held the same territories in appanage, and Dragutin continued to rule them as a Hungarian vassal. Mačva was also known as &quot;Sirmia ulterior&quot;, hence Dragutin&#x27;s contemporaries often styled him as &quot;King of Srem&quot;. He took up his seat at Debrc on the Sava, but he also regularly stayed in Belgrade. He was the first Serbian monarch to rule this town.

Dragutin administered his realm independently of his brother. He supported the Franciscans&#x27; missions in Bosnia and allowed the establishment of a Catholic see in Belgrade. Two Cuman or Bulgarian warlords, Darman and Kudelin, had seized a former Hungarian banate, the Banate of Braničevo. Dragutin invaded Braničevo with Hungarian assistance in 1284 or 1285 but could not defeat them. Darman and Kudelin hired Cuman and Tatar troops and began raiding Dragutin&#x27;s realm. Dragutin sought help from Milutin and the two brothers met in Mačkovac. After they joined their forces and defeated Darman and Kudelin, Dragutin seized Braničevo in 1291 or 1292. The new Hungarian monarch, Andrew III, also supported their military action, but Andrew&#x27;s weak position in Hungary enabled Dragutin to strengthen his independence.
Dragutin&#x27;s sister-in-law, Mary, had laid claim to Hungary after the death of her brother, Ladislaus IV. Dragutin was allegedly willing to support her and her son, Charles Martel of Anjou. Charles Martel, who regarded himself the lawful king of Hungary, granted Slavonia to Dragutin&#x27;s son, Vladislav, in 1292, but most Hungarian noblemen and prelates remained loyal to Andrew III. Dragutin also sought a reconciliation with Andrew, and Vladislav married Constance, the granddaughter of Andrew&#x27;s uncle, Albertino Morosini in 1293. Dragutin took advantage of the disintegration of Hungary during the last decade of the 13th century and became one of the dozen &quot;oligarchs&quot; (or powerful lords) who ruled vast territories independently of the monarch.

Dragutin supported his brother&#x27;s attacks against the Byzantine territories in Macedonia in the 1290s. After Milutin had made peace with the Byzantine Empire in 1299, dozens of Serbian noblemen, who had benefited from the war, moved to Dragutin&#x27;s realm. Tensions between the two brothers grew rapidly, most probably because Milutin wanted to secure the succession in Serbia for his own sons. In 1301, open war broke out and Milutin occupied Rudnik after taking it from Dragutin. According to Ragusan reports, a peace treaty was made in late 1302, but Dragutin&#x27;s troops or allies pillaged Milutin&#x27;s silver mines at Brskovo in 1303. The armed conflict lasted for more than a decade, but its details are unknown. The parties allegedly avoided fighting pitched battles and Dragutin kept his realm almost intact, although income from the silver mines enabled Milutin to hire mercenaries.

Charles Martel&#x27;s son, Charles Robert, came to Hungary to assert his claim to the throne in 1300. His grandfather, Charles II of Naples, listed Dragutin and Dragutin&#x27;s wife among Charles Robert&#x27;s principal supporters. Between the summer of 1301 and May 1304, Charles Robert spent much of his time in the powerful Ugrin Csák&#x27;s domains, which were located to the north of Dragutin&#x27;s realm, implying that Charles Robert&#x27;s relationship with Dragutin was cordial. For unknown reasons, Dragutin&#x27;s troops pillaged Csák&#x27;s domains in 1307, but Csák launched a counter-attack and defeated Dragutin&#x27;s army on an unknown date, sometime before 13 October 1307. Dragutin made an alliance with Charles Robert&#x27;s opponent, Ladislaus Kán, who ruled Transylvania in the 1300s. Dragutin&#x27;s Orthodox son married Kán&#x27;s daughter, for which the papal legate, Gentile Portino da Montefiore, excommunicated Kán at the end of 1309. Historian Alexandar Krstić proposes that Dragutin wanted to secure the Hungarian throne for his elder son, Vladislav, and the Serbian throne for his younger son, Urošica. Records of the destruction that Dragutin and his troops wreaked in Valkó and Szerém Counties most probably refer to Dragutin&#x27;s frequent raids against Ugrin Csák&#x27;s territories in 1309 and 1310. His ally John Smaragd led Dragutin&#x27;s army, but was defeated by Paul Garai, Ugrin&#x27;s commander. Dragutin also seized properties of the Archbishopric of Kalocsa, which prevented the newly elected Archbishop Demetrius from visiting Rome before the end of 1312.
His conflict with Charles Robert forced him to fight on two fronts. He could continue the war against his brother after Serbian noblemen rose up against Milutin in the early 1310s. The Serbian prelates remained loyal to Milutin and helped him to hire Tatar, Jassic and Turkish mercenaries. After Milutin inflicted a decisive defeat on Dragutin in late 1311 or 1312, the prelates mediated a peace treaty between them most probably in 1312. Dragutin had to acknowledge his brother as the lawful king, but his Serbian appanage (including the silver mine at Rubnik) was fully restored to him. Dragutin sent reinforcements to help his brother&#x27;s fight against the powerful Ban of Croatia, Mladen II Šubić of Bribir, in 1313. According to Krstić, Dragutin obviously made a peace treaty with Charles Robert in Sremska Mitrovica in February 1314. In 1314 or 1316, Dragutin signed his brother&#x27;s charter of the grant to the Banjska Monastery as &quot;the former king&quot;.

Dragutin became a monk and adopted the name Teoctist shortly before his death. According to Archbishop Danilo II&#x27;s biography, while he was dying, he stated he could not be venerated as a saint. He died on 12 March 1316. He was buried in the Đurđevi Stupovi Monastery. He is regarded as the second founder of the monastery, which had been built by his great-grandfather, Stephen Nemanja. On the list of Serbian saints, Dragutin is venerated on 12 November or 30 October (Old Style and New Style dates). He was succeeded, in his northern domains, by his son, Stefan Vladislav II.

<text>Stefan Radoslav (; 1192 – after 1235), also known as Stephanos Doukas (), was the King of Serbia, from 1228 to 1233.

== Family ==
Stefan was the eldest son of Stefan Nemanjić (r. 1196–1228), by his first wife Eudokia Angelina, daughter of Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203) and Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamaterina. He reportedly had two sisters, the first of whom, Komnena Nemanjić married first Dhimitër Progoni, and secondly the Greco-Albanian lord Gregorios Kamonas, while the second married the &quot;sebastokrator&quot; Alexander Asen, whom George Acropolites identifies as a son of Tsar Ivan Asen I. It is uncertain if his mother was Maria or Helena, respectively the first and second wife of Ivan Asen I. Alexander was the father of Kaliman II of Bulgaria.

According to the historian John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr., Eudokia was repudiated on grounds of adultery in 1200–01. Fine summarizes a passage of Niketas Choniates to state &quot;She left on foot with only the clothes on her back&quot;. Eudokia sought refuge with her brother-in-law Vukan Nemanjić, Prince of Zeta. Vukan provided her with hospitality for a while and then arranged for her transportation to Durrës, where she boarded a Byzantine ship heading for Constantinople and returned safely to her father. This indicates Stefan Radoslav was born either in the 1190s or the early 1200s (decade).

Fine considers the treatment of Eudokia to be an indication of a decline in the prestige the Byzantine Empire held at the time. The senior Stefan was evidently unafraid of a military confrontation with his former father-in-law which could have occurred in retaliation for his actions. The alliance with the Empire had apparently outlived its use to the Serbian rulers. Stefan Nemanjić had ongoing border disputes with both Vukan Nemanjić and Emeric of Hungary, though outright war had not started yet. The Byzantines had failed to provide him with any military support and Stefan had apparently despaired of any help arriving from that direction. At the same time the senior Stefan was negotiating submitting himself and his subjects to the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for Pope Innocent III declaring him a King. He had reasons to distance himself from the Byzantines and the Eastern Orthodox Church associated with them.

His father was later remarried to Anna Dandolo, a daughter of Ranier Dandolo and granddaughter of Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice. Stefan Radoslav had one paternal half-brother from this marriage, Stefan Uroš I. His mother would proceed to marry secondly to Alexios V Doukas and thirdly to Leo Sgouros, ruler of Nafplion. However, there were no known children by either marriage, thus Radoslav consequently had no maternal half-siblings.

== Ruler of Zachlumia ==
According to &quot;The Realm of the Slavs&quot; (1601) by Mavro Orbin, Stefan Radoslav served as ruler of Zachlumia during the reign of his father. However the sources Orbin used for his history of Zachlumia are not identified by name. They are considered lost and Orbin remains our earliest extant source for several of the events mentioned. According to it Miroslav, the Great was succeeded by his son Andrew (Andrija), only ten-years-old. Missing from the text is Toljen, a son of Miroslav who was mentioned as heir apparent in other sources. With Andrew being underage, the local nobility proceeded to depose him. They offered the crown to Peter (Petar), whose relation to his predecessors is not mentioned by Orbin. Fine notes that later scholars tend to assume Peter was another son of Miroslav and brother or half-brother to Andrew. Some time later, the cause of the exiled Andrew was taken up by Stefan Nemanjić who invated Zachlumia. Peter was forced to retreat to the areas west and north of the river Neretva. The rest of Zachlumia fell into the control of Nemanjić. Fine points that the areas supposedly held by Peter would not be uncontested. They are known from other sources to have been claimed by Andrew, Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia since 1198. Orbin next claims that Nemanjić divided Zachlumia between his cousin Andrew, son of Miroslav and his own son, Radolslav. Andrew was given control of Popovo and coastal Hum. The mainland was granted to Radoslav. Orbin then claims that Radoslav died and Nemanjić granted his area to Andrew. Fine points that Radoslav could not have predeceased his father. We know from other sources that he went on to succeed him. Nemanjić could have simply removed him for his position of authority for reasons lost to us. Orbin continues his account but Radoslav is not mentioned again.

Fine points that the reliability of the above account is at times difficult to determine because the lack of further sources. There are some obvious inaccuracies at times but the basics of the story could be true. A succession crisis in Zachlumia with the existence of rival heirs would be quite plausible. Nemanjić would have reason to get involved. His ongoing rivalry with his brother in the late 1190s would require him to secure control over Zachlumia, in order to prevent Vukan from claiming control for himself. However his activities in the area are otherwise unrecorded. His motivation for backing Andrew against Peter is also unclear. Either of the two could serve as rulers of a puppet state. Installing Radoslav as ruler of eastern Zachlumia would be a way to secure tighter control of the region.

Orbin does not actually provide dates for the events of his account. Fine proceeds to estimate them, based on sources recording other events in the wider region. He estimates the death of Miroslav to 1198. Explaining why Andrew of Croatia and Dalmatia chose that year to attack. He acquired control over areas of Zachlumia northwest of the Neretva. By 1203, this Andrew was involved in conflict with his own brother, Emeric of Hungary. The ongoing conflict would allow Peter to claim the areas northwest of the Neretva for himself. He could have either taken advantage of Andrew&#x27;s troops already withdrawing or using his own forces to drive them out. Either way, Andrew could probably not afford maintaining two fronts of war at the same time. Securing the area as his powerbase, Peter could then drive his brother from eastern Zachlumia. The amount of time between the time Andrew of Zachlumia went into exile and the decision of Nemanjić to intervene is left unclear in the account by Orbin. Fine suggests it could have been more than a decade. He suggests it could be as late as 1216, just a year before Nemanjić was declared a King by Pope Honorius III. Nemanjić could by then devote his forces to securing eastern Zachlumia for Andrew, his intended puppet ruler. He could then attempt to secure even tighter control by appointing Radoslav in the areas directly bordering Raška. The area could have stayed under his control for longer than Orbin indicates. Fine points that Andrew seems to have &quot;disappeared from the scene&quot; by 1218 when Peter is recorded to have taken over the coastal areas. There seems to be no indication of Peter extending his control to the areas supposedly ruled by Radoslav.

== Reign and deposition ==

Fine mentions Radoslav acting as governor of the Principality of Zeta for part the reign of his father. In a charter variously dated to 1222 or 1228, Radoslav appears as co-founder of the monastery of Žiča with his father. King Stefan the First-Crowned, who had become ill, took monastic vows and died in 1227. Radoslav who was the eldest son succeeded as King, crowned at Žiča by Archbishop Sava, his uncle and the first Archbishop (since 1219) of the autocephalous Serbian Orthodox Church. The younger sons, Vladislav and Uroš I, received appanages. The youngest of the brothers, Sava II, was appointed Bishop of Hum shortly thereafter, later serving as Archbishop of Serbia (1263-1270). The Church and state were thus dominated by the same family and the ties between the two as well as the family&#x27;s role within the Church continued.

According to biographer and monk Theodosius, Radoslav was a good ruler at first, but then fell under the influence of his wife, who was the daughter of the ruler of Epirus and Thessalonica, Theodore Komnenos Doukas (r. 1215–1230). Radoslav was most likely not beloved by the Serbian nobility due to this Greek influence. Radoslav used his Greek name, Stephanos Doukas, on his coinage, in several Greek documents and even once in his signature.

Radoslav was probably safe from domestic rebellion as long as his father-in-law Theodore remained strong. In 1230, however, Theodore was defeated and captured by Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Asen II, after which Radoslav&#x27;s position seems to have weakened; some of his nobility revolted in autumn 1233. Serbian medieval biographers noted that the nobility had left the support of Radoslav and stood itself behind the younger Vladislav. Radoslav fled the country between 1 September 1233 and 4 February 1234, and was unable to regain the kingdom, but eventually returned as a monk. Radoslav fled to Dubrovnik (1233) with his wife, and there are indications that Radoslav had organized some actions against Vladislav and that he thought that he would manage to return to the throne - this is evident from an dated 4 February 1234, regarding a promise to Ragusan trading privileges once he had returned to Serbia. Because of this, Vladislav began threatening Ragusa, which then had to turn to Bosnian Ban Ninoslav for help, and as the action against Vladislav was unsuccessful, Radoslav found refuge with the Epirote ruler Michael II Komnenos Doukas in Dyrrhachium. 

According to Theodosius, Radoslav&#x27;s wife Anna had left him for a commander of the fortress, a Frank. However, this account has been proven to be false, as there was no Frankish commander in Dyrrachium in Radoslav&#x27;s time. After some time, Radoslav and his wife returned together to Serbia and took monastic vows. 

Vladislav was crowned King upon Radoslav&#x27;s flight. Vladislav married the daughter of Ivan Asen II, much thanks to Sava. Sava then abdicated in favour of his apprentice Arsenije in the end of 1233. Sava died while heading home from a Holy Land trip, while visiting the Bulgarian court in 1235, and was respectfully buried at the Holy Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo. Sava&#x27;s body was returned to Serbia after a series of requests, and was then buried in the Mileševa monastery, built by Vladislav in 1234. Sava was canonized and his relics were miraculous; his cult remained important throughout the Middle Ages and the Ottoman occupation.

According to Fine both Radoslav and Anna retired into monastic life following their deposition. His monastic name was Jovan. The time and circumstances of his death are unknown. The relations between Vladislav and Radoslav after he had returned and became a monk are not fully known, but he did not disturb his brother. There is a hypothesis that Radoslav even received a part of Serbian land to administrate. In any case, Radoslav continued the rest of his life in peace.

The &quot;Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten&quot; (1978) by Detlev Schwennicke, reports Radoslav betrothed to Theodora Komnene c. 1217. She was a daughter of Michael I Komnenos Doukas, ruler of Epirus. Both of his wives were members of the Melissenos family. Uncertain which of the two was her mother. Fine indicates Radoslav would instead marry her first cousin Anna Doukaina Angelina in 1219/1220. She was a daughter of Theodore Komnenos Doukas and Maria Petraliphaina. The &quot;Europäische Stammtafeln&quot; reports the marriage resulting in the birth of a single child.

<text>Sadyattes (; ; reigned 637–) was the third king of the Mermnad dynasty in Lydia, the son of Ardys and the grandson of Gyges of Lydia. Sadyattes reigned 12 years according to Herodotus.

==Reign==
===Background===
Sadyattes came to power during period of severe crisis that Lydia was facing because of several waves of invasions by the Cimmerians, a nomadic people from the Eurasian Steppe who had invaded the Western Asia. The Cimmerians attacked Lydia several times but had been repelled by Sadyattes&#x27;s grandfather, Gyges, but in 644 BC, the Cimmerians attacked Lydia for the third time, led by their king Lygdamis. The Lydians were defeated, Sardis was sacked, and Gyges was killed, following which he was succeeded by his son, Ardys, who was the father of Sadyattes.

In 637 BC, that is in Ardys&#x27;s seventh regnal year, the Thracian Treres tribe who had migrated across the Thracian Bosporus and invaded Anatolia, under their king Kobos, and in alliance with the Cimmerians and the Lycians, attacked Lydia. They defeated the Lydians again and for a second time sacked the Lydian capital of Sardis, except for its citadel. It is probable that Ardys was killed during this Cimmerian attack, or that he was deposed for being unable to protect Lydia from the Cimmerian attacks.

===Reign===
Sadyattes&#x27;s reign was even more short-lived than that of his father Ardys: although Herodotus claimed that Ardys had reigned for twelve years, modern estimates give him a much shorter reign of only two years. Little is known about the reign of Sadyattes except that he began a war with the Ionian Greek maritime city of Miletus.

===End of reign===
Sadyattes&#x27;s reign ended in 635 BC. It is possible that, like his grandfather Gyges, he died fighting the Cimmerians. Alternatively, Sadyattes might have been deposed for failing to protect Lydia from the Cimmerian attacks. He was succeeded by his son Alyattes, who continued the war against Miletus and would transform Lydia into a powerful empire.

===Aftermath===
Soon after 635 BC, with Assyrian approval and in alliance with the Lydians, the Scythians under their king Madyes entered Anatolia, expelled the Treres from Asia Minor, and defeated the Cimmerians so that they no longer constituted a threat again, following which the Scythians extended their domination to Central Anatolia until they were themselves expelled by the Medes from Western Asia in the 600s BC. This final defeat of the Cimmerians was carried out by the joint forces of Madyes, whom Strabo credits with expelling the Treres and Cimmerians from Asia Minor, and of Sadyattes&#x27;s son, the king Alyattes of Lydia, whom Herodotus and Polyaenus claim finally defeated the Cimmerians.

<text>Metropolitan State University (Metro State) is a public university in the Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. It is a member of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system.

==History==

The institution was founded in 1971 as Minnesota Metropolitan State College with a mission to educate non-traditional students from the Twin Cities metropolitan area whose needs were not served by other existing institutions. David E. Sweet was appointed the university&#x27;s first president and the school, with offices above a drugstore in downtown St. Paul, admitted the first class of 50 students in 1972. The university had no campus and held classes in rented space throughout the Twin Cities metropolitan area. When Metropolitan State began, it was a college for working adults. It was strictly an upper-division college where students could complete only their junior and senior years of academic study. The university initially followed a non-traditional course: it offered competence-based learning whereby students were recognized for learning gained outside the classroom—including prior learning through experience. Letter grades were available, but they were always optional. Students designed their own degree plans.

During the 1980s, enrollment grew from around 1,000 students to over 2,500. The university expanded its programs to 30 baccalaureate programs as the state increased funding for the institution.

The university began admitting freshmen and sophomores and adopted general education requirements and a grading policy with grade point averages in 1994. In 1992, the main campus moved to the Dayton&#x27;s Bluff section of east Saint Paul. The university maintained a commitment to offering classes in spaces throughout the metropolitan area. Today the main campus is in Saint Paul, and additional campus facilities are in Midway, Minneapolis, and Brooklyn Park.

During the 2009–2010 school year, Metro State enrolled 6,000 full-time equivalent students. From 2008 to June 30, 2014, Sue K. Hammersmith was Metro State&#x27;s president. During Hammersmith&#x27;s six-year tenure, the number of degrees conferred increased by 38%. Devinder Malhotra became Metro State&#x27;s president on July 1, 2014. During the 2014–2015 school year, Metro State served 12,000 full and part-time students. Virginia Arthur was Metro State&#x27;s provost from 2012 until 2016, when she became the university&#x27;s president.

==Academics==
As part of its mission to educate working adults and non-traditional students, Metro State previously had an open admissions policy with rolling applications accepted throughout the year. According to U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s 2022 &quot;Best Colleges&quot; ranking guide, Metro State University is a &#x27;national university&#x27; with a 56% acceptance rate.

Metro State offers 62 undergraduate degree programs, a self-designed B.A. degree in liberal arts, a self-designed/individualized B.A. degree, and three undergraduate certificates through its four colleges and three schools: the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Management, the College of Health, Community and Professional Studies, the School of Nursing, the School of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, the School of Urban Education and the College of Individualized Studies.

Metro State University offers 25 master&#x27;s degree programs, an MA or MS degree in individualized studies, and an interdisciplinary Master of Arts degree in liberal studies. The university also offers eleven graduate certificate programs. In 2007, Metro State began offering an applied doctor of nursing practice degree. Metro State launched the first applied doctorate in business administration within the Minnesota State system during fall semester 2010. The Bachelor of Science in Accounting program is the largest in Minnesota. Moreover, graduates of Metro State&#x27;s accounting program consistently place among the top-10 finishers in Minnesota&#x27;s exacting CPA examination. Altogether, Metro State offers a total of 108 undergraduate and graduate academic degrees and certificates—this does not include any undergraduate minor programs.

The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission with specific programs accredited by relevant discipline-specific accreditors such as the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). Metro State is also accredited by the Minnesota Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board (PELSB), the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST), and the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). In addition, Metro State has received recognition and endorsements from the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) and from the National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education.

==Student demographics==

Based on data from the 2016–2017 academic year, 45% of Metro State University&#x27;s student body were students of color, while 4% were from out of state and 2% were international. 42% of students were male and 58% were female. Students ranged in age from 15 to 84. The Class of 2015 had an 82% licensure exam pass rate. Metro State has a 67% six-year graduation rate.

==Student accommodations==
Metro State University accommodates the needs of working adults by scheduling many of its classes in the evening and on weekends. It is possible for recent graduates of Minneapolis and St. Paul public high schools to attend Metro State tuition free.

==Library==

In 2002, the Minnesota legislature approved funding for the construction of a library at the St. Paul campus; the building opened in 2004. The library also houses a branch of the Saint Paul Public Library. This is Minnesota&#x27;s only university/public library partnership and one of only a few nationwide.

To encourage the spiritual development of students and members of the community, the library built the David Barton Community Labyrinth and Reflective Garden, named in honor of the library&#x27;s first dean. The labyrinth is open to the public and has been the setting for several events.

==Notable alumni==
Metro State&#x27;s first graduating class consisted of 12 people on February 1, 1973. As of December 16, 2024, Metro State has 56,354 alumni. Notable alumni include:

<text>Viscount Ilya Romanovich Prigogine (; ; 28 May 2003) was a Belgian physical chemist of Russian-Jewish origin, noted for his work on dissipative structures, complex systems, and irreversibility.

Prigogine&#x27;s work most notably earned him the 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for his contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, particularly the theory of dissipative structures”, as well as the Francqui Prize in 1955, and the Rumford Medal in 1976.

==Biography==
===Early life and studies===
Prigogine was born in Moscow a few months before the October Revolution of 1917, into a Jewish family. His father, Ruvim (Roman) Abramovich Prigogine, was a chemist who studied at the Imperial Moscow Technical School and owned a soap factory; his mother, Yulia Vikhman, was a pianist who attended the Moscow Conservatory. In 1921, the factory having been nationalized by the new Soviet regime and the feeling of insecurity rising amidst the civil war, the family left Russia. After a brief period in Lithuania, they went to Germany and settled in Berlin; 8 years later, due to the poor economic situation and the creeping emergence of Nazism, they moved on to Brussels, where Prigogine received Belgian nationality in 1949. His brother Alexandre (1913–1991) became an ornithologist.

As a teenager, Prigogine was interested in music, history and archeology. He graduated from the &quot;Athenée d&#x27;Ixelles&quot; in 1935, majoring in Greek and Latin. His parents encouraged him to become a lawyer, and he initially enrolled in law studies at the Free University of Brussels. At that time he developed an interest in psychology and the study of behavior; in turn, reading about these subjects triggered an interest in chemistry, as chemical processes impact the mind and body; this also triggered a more fundamental interest in physics, as they explain chemistry. He ended up dropping out from the law faculty.

Prigogine afterwards simultaneously enrolled in chemistry and physics at the Free University of Brussels, something he achieved with &quot;uncommon success&quot;; he earned the equivalent of a Master&#x27;s degree in both disciplines in 1939, and a PhD in chemistry in 1941 under Théophile de Donder.

===Early career, World War II===
He started his research career under the German occupation of Belgium. From 1940 onwards he gave clandestine lectures to students. In 1941, the university formally closed to protest the forced appointment of Flemish pro-Nazi New Order professors by the occupiers; he continued giving clandestine lectures until the Liberation of Belgium in 1944. During that time window he also published 21 articles. In 1943, Prigogine and his future wife Hélène Jofé were arrested by the Germans; after multiple interventions including by the Queen Elisabeth, they were eventually released a couple of weeks later.

===Later career===
In 1951, he became a full professor at his alma mater; at 34 years old, he was the youngest ever full professor at the science faculty in Brussels. In 1959, he was appointed director of the International Solvay Institute in Brussels, Belgium. In that year, he also started teaching at the University of Texas at Austin in the United States, where he later was appointed Regental Professor and Ashbel Smith Professor of Physics and Chemical Engineering. From 1961 until 1966 he was affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago and was a visiting professor at Northwestern University. In Austin, in 1967, he co-founded the Center for Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, now the Center for Complex Quantum Systems. In that year, he also returned to Belgium, where he became director of the Center for Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics.

He was a member of numerous scientific organizations, and received numerous awards, prizes and 53 honorary degrees. In 1955, Prigogine was awarded the Francqui Prize for Exact Sciences. For his study in irreversible thermodynamics, he received the Rumford Medal in 1976, and in 1977, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, particularly the theory of dissipative structures&quot;. In 1989, he was awarded the title of viscount in the Belgian nobility by the King of the Belgians. Until his death, he was president of the International Academy of Science, Munich and was in 1997, one of the founders of the International Commission on Distance Education (CODE), a worldwide accreditation agency. Prigogine received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1985 and in 1998 he was awarded an &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctorate by the UNAM in Mexico City.

Prigogine was first married to belgian poet Hélène Jofé (as an author also known as Hélène Prigogine) and in 1945 they had a son Yves. After their divorce, he married Polish-born chemist Maria Prokopowicz (also known as Maria Prigogine) in 1961. In 1970 they had a son, Pascal.

In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

==Research==
Prigogine defined dissipative structures and their role in thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, a discovery that won him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977. In summary, Ilya Prigogine discovered that importation and dissipation of energy into chemical systems could result in the emergence of new structures (hence dissipative structures) due to internal self reorganization. In his 1955 text, Prigogine drew connections between dissipative structures and the Rayleigh-Bénard instability and the Turing mechanism. And his 1977 work on self-reorganization was recognized as relevant for psychology.

===Dissipative structures theory===
Dissipative structure theory led to pioneering research in self-organizing systems, as well as philosophical inquiries into the formation of complexity in biological entities and the quest for a creative and irreversible role of time in the natural sciences.

With professor Robert Herman, he also developed the basis of the two fluid model, a traffic model in traffic engineering for urban networks, analogous to the two fluid model in classical statistical mechanics, a common problem that had attracted Prigogine&#x27;s attention some years before.

Prigogine&#x27;s formal concept of self-organization was used also as a &quot;complementary bridge&quot; between general systems theory and thermodynamics, conciliating the cloudiness of some important systems theory concepts such as entropy instead of molecular disorder, and emergence, fluctuations and irreversibility instead of “birth and death” with scientific rigor.

===Work on unsolved problems in physics===

In his later years, his work concentrated on the fundamental role of indeterminism in nonlinear systems on both the classical and quantum level. Prigogine and coworkers proposed a Liouville space extension of quantum mechanics. A Liouville space is the vector space formed by the set of (self-adjoint) linear operators, equipped with an inner product, that act on a Hilbert space. There exists a mapping of each linear operator into Liouville space, yet not every self-adjoint operator of Liouville space has a counterpart in Hilbert space, and in this sense Liouville space has a richer structure than Hilbert space. The Liouville space extension proposal by Prigogine and co-workers aimed to solve the arrow of time problem of thermodynamics and the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.

Prigogine co-authored several books with Isabelle Stengers, including &quot;The End of Certainty&quot; and &quot;La Nouvelle Alliance&quot; (&quot;Order out of Chaos&quot;).

===&quot;The End of Certainty&quot;===
In his 1996 book, &quot;La Fin des certitudes&quot;, written in collaboration with Isabelle Stengers and published in English in 1997 as &quot;The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos, and the New Laws of Nature&quot;, Prigogine contends that determinism is no longer a viable scientific belief: &quot;The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism.&quot; This is a major departure from the approach of Newton, Einstein and Schrödinger, all of whom expressed their theories in terms of deterministic equations. According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of irreversibility and instability.

Prigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to Darwin, whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired Ludwig Boltzmann to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles. This led to the field of statistical mechanics and the realization that gases undergo irreversible processes. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the arrow of time. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the &quot;present,&quot; which follows a determined &quot;past&quot; and precedes an undetermined &quot;future.&quot; All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or as undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including diffusion, radioactive decay, solar radiation, weather and the emergence and evolution of life. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of probability.

Prigogine asserts that Newtonian physics has now been &quot;extended&quot; three times: first with the introduction of spacetime in general relativity, then with the use of the wave function in quantum mechanics, and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems (chaos theory).

<text>Private schools in the United Kingdom (also called independent schools) are schools that require fees for admission and enrolment. Some have financial endowments, most are governed by a board of governors, and are owned by a mixture of corporations, trusts and private individuals. They are independent of many of the regulations and conditions that apply to state-funded schools. For example, the schools do not have to follow the National Curriculum for England, although many such schools do.

Historically, the term &quot;private school&quot; referred to a school in private ownership, in contrast to an endowed school subject to a trust or of charitable status. Many of the older independent schools catering for the 13–18 age range in England and Wales are known as public schools, seven of which were the subject of the Public Schools Act 1868. The term &quot;public school&quot; meant they were then open to pupils regardless of where they lived or their religion (while in the United States and most other English-speaking countries &quot;public school&quot; refers to a publicly funded state school). Prep (preparatory) schools (also known as &quot;private schools&quot;) educate younger children up to the age of 13 to prepare them for entry to the public schools and other secondary schools. In 2023, the Independent Schools Council reports that private schools contribute £16.5 billion to gross value added (GVA) in Britain.

Some former grammar schools converted to a private fee-charging model following the 1965 Circular 10/65 and the subsequent cessation in 1975 of government funding support for direct grant grammar schools. There are around 2,600 independent schools in the UK, which educate around 615,000 children, approximately 7 per cent of all British school-age children. Among pupils over the age of 16, the figure is 18 per cent. In addition to charging tuition fees, they may also benefit from gifts, charitable endowments and charitable status. Some of these schools (1,300) are members of the Independent Schools Council. In 2021, the average annual cost for private schooling was £15,191 for day schools and £36,000 for boarding schools. &quot;The Independent Schools Yearbook&quot; has been published annually since 1986. This was a name change of a publication that started in 1889 as &quot;The Public Schools Yearbook&quot;.

==Origins==
Some independent schools are particularly old, such as The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury (founded 597), The King&#x27;s School, Rochester (founded 604), St Peter&#x27;s School, York (founded c. 627), Sherborne School (founded 705), Wells Cathedral School (founded 909), Warwick School (c. 914), King&#x27;s Ely (c. 970) and St Albans School (948). These schools were founded by the church and were under its complete dominion. During the late 14th and early 15th centuries the first schools independent of the church were founded. Winchester (1382) and Oswestry (1407) were the first of their kind (although they had a strong Christian religious ethos) and such early &quot;free grammar schools&quot; founded by wealthy benefactors paved the way for the establishment of the modern &quot;public school&quot;. These were typically established for male students from poor or disadvantaged backgrounds. English law has always regarded education as a charitable end in itself, irrespective of poverty.

The transformation of free charitable foundations into institutions which sometimes charge fees came about readily: the foundation would only afford minimal facilities, so that further fees might be charged to lodge, clothe and otherwise maintain the scholars, to the private profit of the trustees or headmaster. Also, facilities already provided by the charitable foundation for a few students could profitably be extended to further paying pupils. Some schools still keep their foundation students in a separate house from other pupils, or distinguish them in other ways.

After a time, such fees eclipsed the original charitable income, and the original endowment would become a minor part of the school&#x27;s finances. By 2022 senior boarding schools were charging fees of over £40,000 per annum. Most of the independent schools today are still registered as a charity, and bursaries are available to students on a means test basis. Christ&#x27;s Hospital in Horsham is an example: a large proportion of its students are funded by its charitable foundation or by various benefactors.

==Victorian expansion==

The educational reforms of the 19th century were particularly important. Reformers included Thomas Arnold at Rugby, and then Samuel Butler and later Benjamin Kennedy at Shrewsbury; the first of these emphasised team spirit and &quot;muscular Christianity&quot; and the latter the importance of scholarship and competitive examinations. Edward Thring of Uppingham School introduced major reforms, focusing on the importance of the individual and of competition, as well as the need for a &quot;total curriculum&quot; with academia, music, sport and drama being central to education. Most public schools developed significantly during the 18th and 19th centuries, and came to play an important role in the development of the Victorian social elite. Under a number of forward-looking headmasters leading public schools created a curriculum based heavily on classics and physical activity for boys and young men of the upper and upper middle classes.

They were schools for the gentlemanly elite of Victorian politics, armed forces and colonial government. Much of the discipline was in the hands of senior pupils (usually known as prefects); this was not just a way to reduce staffing costs, but was also seen as vital preparation for the senior pupils&#x27; later roles in public or military service. More recently heads of public schools have been emphasising that senior pupils now play a much reduced role in maintaining discipline. To an extent, the public school system influenced the school systems of the British Empire, and recognisably public schools can be found in many Commonwealth countries.

==20th and 21st centuries==

Until 1975 there had been a group of 179 academically selective schools drawing on both private and state funding, the direct grant grammar schools. The Direct Grant Grammar Schools (Cessation of Grant) Regulations 1975 required these schools to choose between full state funding as comprehensive schools and full independence. As a result, 119 of these schools became independent.

Pupil numbers at independent schools fell slightly during the mid-1970s recession. At the same time participation at all secondary schools grew dramatically, so that the share of the independent sector fell from a little under 8 per cent in 1964 to reach a low of 5.7 per cent in 1978. Both these trends were reversed during the 1980s, and the share of the independent schools reached 7.5 per cent by 1991. The changes since 1990 have been less dramatic: the share fell to 6.9 per cent by 1996 before increasing very slightly after 2000 to reach 7.2 per cent in 2012. By 2015, the figure fell back to 6.9 per cent, with the absolute number of pupils attending independent schools falling everywhere in England apart from in the South East.

===England and Wales===
In 2011 there were more than 2,500 private schools in the UK educating some 628,000 children, comprising over 6.5 per cent of UK children, and more than 18 per cent of pupils over the age of 16. In England the schools account for a slightly higher percentage than in the UK as a whole. According to a 2010 study by Ryan &amp; Sibetia, &quot;the proportion of pupils attending independent schools in England is currently 7.2 per cent (considering full-time pupils only)&quot;.

Most of the larger private schools are either full or partial boarding schools, although many have now become predominantly day schools. By contrast there are only a few dozen state boarding schools. Boarding-school traditions give a distinctive character to British private education, even in the case of day-pupils. A high proportion of private schools, particularly the larger and older institutions, have charitable status. 
;Inspections in England
The Independent Schools Council (ISC), through seven affiliated organisations, represents 1,300 schools that together educate over 80 per cent of the pupils in the UK private sector. Those schools in England which are members of the affiliated organisations of the ISC are inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate under a framework approved by the Government&#x27;s Department for Education (DfE). Private schools not affiliated to the ISC in England are inspected by Ofsted. Private schools accredited to the ISC in Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland or others in England out with the inspectorial bodies listed above are inspected through the national inspectorates in each country.

===Scotland===

Private schools in Scotland educate about 31,000 children. Although many of the Scottish private schools are members of the ISC they are also represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, recognised by the Scottish Parliament as the body representing private schools in Scotland. Unlike England, all Scottish private schools are subject to the same regime of inspections by Education Scotland as local authority schools and they have to register with the Learning Directorate. The nine largest Scottish private schools, with 1,000 or more pupils, are George Watson&#x27;s College, Hutcheson&#x27;s Grammar School, Robert Gordon&#x27;s College, George Heriot&#x27;s School, St Aloysius&#x27; College, The Glasgow Academy, Dollar Academy, the High School of Glasgow and the High School of Dundee.

In Scotland, it was common for children destined for private schools to receive their primary education at a local school. This arose because of Scotland&#x27;s long tradition of state-funded education, which was spearheaded by the Church of Scotland from the seventeenth century, long before such education was common in England. Private prep schools only became more widespread in Scotland from the late 19th century (usually attached to an existing secondary private school, though exceptions such as Craigclowan Preparatory School and Cargilfield Preparatory School do exist), though they are still much less prevalent than in England. In modern times many secondary pupils in Scotland&#x27;s private schools will have fed in from the school&#x27;s own fee-paying primary school, therefore there is considerable competition facing pupils from state primary schools who seek to enter a private school at secondary stage, via entrance examinations.

==Selection==
Private schools, like state grammar schools, are free to select their pupils, subject to general legislation against discrimination. The principal forms of selection are financial, in that the pupil&#x27;s family must be able to pay the school fees, and academic, the latter determined via interview and examination. Credit may also be given for musical, sporting or other talent. Entrance to some schools may be orientated to pupils whose parents practise a particular religion, or schools may require pupils to attend religious services.

Only a small minority of parents can afford school fees averaging (as of 2021) over £36,000 per annum for boarding pupils and £15,000 for day pupils, with additional costs for uniform, equipment and extra-curricular activities. Scholarships and means-tested bursaries to assist the education of the less well-off are usually awarded by a process which combines academic and other criteria.

Private schools are generally academically selective, using the competitive Common Entrance Examination at ages 11+ or 13+. Schools often offer scholarships to attract abler pupils (which improves their average results); the standard sometimes approaches the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) intended for age 16. Poorly-performing pupils may be required to leave, and following GCSE results can be replaced in the sixth form by a new infusion of high-performing sixth-form-only pupils, which may distort apparent results. On the other hand, pupils performing poorly cannot legally be excluded from a state school solely for poor performance.

==Conditions==
Private schools, as compared with maintained schools, generally have more individual teaching; much lower pupil-teacher ratios at around 9:1; longer teaching hours (sometimes including Saturday morning teaching) and homework (known as prep); though they have shorter terms. They also have more time for organised extra-curricular activities.

As boarding schools are fully responsible for their pupils throughout term-time, pastoral care is an essential part of boarding education, and many such schools have their own distinctive ethos, including social aspirations, manners and accents, associated with their own school traditions. Many former pupils aspire to send their own children to their old schools over successive generations. Most offer sporting, musical, dramatic and art facilities, sometimes with extra charges.

Educational achievement is generally very good. Independent school pupils are four times more likely to attain an A* at GCSE than their non-selective state sector counterparts, and twice as likely to attain an A grade at A-level. A much higher proportion go to university. Some schools specialise in particular strengths, academic or other, although this is not as common as it is in the state sector.

Independent schools can set their own discipline regime, with much greater freedom to exclude children, primarily exercised in the wider interests of the school. In England and Wales there are no requirements for teaching staff to have Qualified Teacher Status or to be registered with the General Teaching Council. In Scotland a teaching qualification and registration with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) are mandatory for all teaching positions.

==Criticisms==
Private schools are often criticised for being elitist, and seen as lying outside the spirit of the state system. Francis Green and David Kynaston have written that &quot;among affluent countries, Britain’s private‑school participation is especially exclusive to the rich&quot;, and that the &quot;existence in Britain of a flourishing private-school sector not only limits the life chances of those who attend state schools but also damages society at large&quot;. Many of the best-known public schools are extremely expensive, and many have entry criteria geared towards those who have been at private &quot;feeder&quot; preparatory schools. The Thatcher government introduced the Assisted Places Scheme in England and Wales in 1980, whereby the state paid the school fees for those pupils capable of gaining a place but unable to afford the fees. This was essentially a response to the decision of the previous Labour government in the mid-1970s to remove government funding of direct grant grammar schools, most of which then became private schools; some Assisted Places pupils went to the former direct-grant schools such as Manchester Grammar School. The scheme was terminated by the Labour government in 1997, and since then the private sector has moved to increase its own means-tested bursaries.

The former classics-based curriculum was also criticised for not providing skills in sciences or engineering, but was perhaps in response to the requirement of classics for entry to Oxbridge until the early 1960s, as well as a hangover from centuries ago when &quot;only&quot; Latin and Greek were taught at many public schools. It was Martin Wiener&#x27;s opposition to this tendency which inspired his 1981 book &quot;English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit: 1850–1980&quot;, which became an influence on the Thatcher government&#x27;s opposition to old-school gentlemanly Toryism. The curriculum in private school was consequently &#x27;modernised&#x27; and according to a 2010 report from the Department for Education, private school pupils had &quot;the highest rates of achieving grades A or B in A-level maths and sciences&quot; compared to grammar, specialist and mainstream state schools, and pupils at private schools account for a disproportionate number of the total number of A-levels in maths and sciences.

Some parents complain that their rights and their children&#x27;s are compromised by vague and one-sided contracts which allow Heads to use discretionary powers unfairly, such as in expulsion on non-disciplinary grounds. They believe private schools have not embraced the principles of natural justice as adopted by the state sector, and private law as applied to Higher Education. This belief is reinforced by the fact that the legal rights of pupils are governed by a private contract, as opposed to rights implemented by the national government. For instance, a pupil whose application for admission to a state school is rejected is legally entitled to appeal, whereas at a private school admissions are at the discretion of the governing body of the school. In 2006, pupils at fee-paying schools made up 43 per cent of those selected for places at Oxford University and 38 per cent of those granted places at Cambridge University (although such pupils represent only 18 per cent of the 16 years old plus school population). In 2024, the Labour government removed the exemption from value-added tax (VAT) from private school fees. From January 2025, private schools will have to charge 20% VAT.

===Charitable status===

A major area of debate in recent years has centred around the continuing charitable status of private schools, which means they are not charged business rates by local councils, amongst other benefits. This is estimated to save the schools about £200 per pupil and to cost the Exchequer about £100 million in tax breaks, assuming that an increase in fees would not result in any transfer of pupils from private to maintained sector.

Since the Charities Act was passed in November 2006, charitable status is based on an organisation providing a &quot;public benefit&quot;, as judged by the Charity Commission. In 2008, the Charity Commission published guidance, including guidance on public benefit and fee charging, setting out issues to be considered by charities charging high fees that many people could not afford. The Independent Schools Council was granted permission by the High Court to bring a judicial review of the Charity Commission&#x27;s public benefit guidance as it affected the private education sector. This was heard by the Upper Tribunal at the same time as a reference by the Attorney General asking the Tribunal to consider how the public benefit requirement should operate in relation to fee-charging charitable schools. The Upper Tribunal&#x27;s decision, published on 14 October 2011, concluded that in all cases there must be more than &quot;de minimis&quot; or token benefit for the poor, but that trustees of a charitable private school should decide what was appropriate in their particular circumstances.

The Charity Commission accordingly published revised public benefit guidance in 2013. In Scotland, under the Charities and Trustee Investment Act (Scotland), there is an entirely separate test of charitable status, overseen by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, which assesses the public benefit provided by each registered school charity.

===Abuse===

Journalist Alex Renton has written about abuse of pupils at boarding schools; &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that he says that boarding school are &quot;simply unsafe&quot; and that &quot;he has, he says, a database of more than 800 criminal allegations from former schoolchildren of 300 mainly private boarding schools&quot;. He presented an episode of the television programme &quot;Exposure&quot;, &quot;Boarding Schools, the Secret Shame&quot;. In 2022, he co-wrote (with Caitlin Smith) and presented a BBC Radio 4 series, &quot;In Dark Corners&quot;, about abuse and cover-up at some of Britain&#x27;s elite schools, including Eton College, Fettes College, Gordonstoun and its junior school.

===Extra exam time===

An investigation into official exam data by the BBC&#x27;s Radio 4 Today programme, in 2017, showed that 20% of private school pupils were given extra time for their GCSE and A level exams, as compared with fewer than 12% of pupils in public sector schools. The most commonly given amount of extra exam time is 25%. Such &#x27;exam access&#x27; arrangements are given for a range of disabilities and educational special needs such as dyslexia, dyspraxia and ADHD.

==Types and degree classes==
In 2002, Jeremy Smith and Robin Naylor of the University of Warwick conducted a study into the determinants of degree performance at UK universities. Their study confirmed that the internationally recognised phenomenon whereby &quot;children from more advantaged class backgrounds have higher levels of educational attainment than children from less-advantaged class backgrounds&quot; persists at university level in the United Kingdom.
The authors noted &quot;a very well-determined and monotonically positive effect defined over Social Classes I to V&quot; whereby, for both men and women, other things being equal, academic performance at university is better the more advantaged is the student&#x27;s home background&quot;. but they also observed that a student educated at a private school was on average 6 per cent less likely to receive a first or an upper second-class degree than a student from the same social class background, of the same gender, who had achieved the same A-level score at a state school. 

The averaged effect was described as very variable across the social class and A-level attainment of the candidates; it was &quot;small and not strongly significant for students with high A-level scores&quot; (i.e. for students at the more selective universities) and &quot;statistically significant mostly for students from lower occupationally-ranked social-class backgrounds&quot;. Additionally, the study could not take into account the effect of a slightly different and more traditional subject mix studied by private students at university on university achievement. Despite these caveats, the paper attracted much press attention. The same study found wide variations between different independent schools, suggesting that students from a few of them were in fact significantly more likely to obtain the better degrees than state students of the same gender and class background having the same A-level score.

In 2011, a subsequent study led by Richard Partington at Cambridge University showed that A-level performance is &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; the best predictor for exam performance in the earlier years (&quot;Part I&quot;) of the undergraduate degree at Cambridge. Partington&#x27;s summary specified that &quot;questions of school background and gender&quot; ... &quot;make only a marginal difference and the pattern – particularly in relation to school background – is in any case inconsistent.&quot;

A study commissioned by the Sutton Trust and published in 2010 focused mainly on the possible use of US-style SAT tests as a way of detecting a candidate&#x27;s academic potential. Its findings confirmed those of the Smith &amp; Naylor study in that it found that privately educated pupils who, despite their educational advantages, have only secured a poor A-level score, and who therefore attend less selective universities, do less well than state educated degree candidates with the same low A-level attainment. In addition, as discussed in the 2010 Buckingham report &quot;HMC Schools: a quantitative analysis&quot;, because students from state schools tended to be admitted on lower A-level entry grades, relative to entry grades it could be claimed that these students had improved more. A countervailing finding of the Sutton Trust study was that for students of a given level of A-level attainment it is almost twice as difficult to get a first at the most selective universities than at those on the other end of the scale. Private sector schools regularly dominate the top of the A-level league tables, and their students are more likely to apply to the most selective universities; as a result private sector students are particularly well represented at these institutions, and therefore only the very ablest of them are likely to secure the best degrees.

In 2013, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) published a study noting, amongst other things, that a greater percentage of students who had attended a private school prior to university achieved a first or upper second class degree compared with students from state schools. Out of a starting cohort of 24,360 candidates having attended a private school and 184,580 having attended a state school, 64.9 per cent of the former attained a first or upper second class degree, compared to 52.7 per cent of the latter. No statistical comparisons of the two groups (State vs Private) were reported, with or without controls for student characteristics such as entry qualifications, so no inferences can be drawn on the relative performance of the two groups. The stand-out finding of the study was that private school students achieved better in obtaining graduate jobs and study, even when student characteristics were allowed for (sex, ethnicity, school type, entry qualifications, area of study).

In 2015, the UK press widely reported the outcome of research suggesting that school-leavers from state schools that attained similar A level grades go on to achieve higher undergraduate degree classes than their private school counterparts. The quoted figures, based on the degree results of all students who graduated in 2013/14, suggested that 82 per cent of state school pupils got firsts or upper seconds compared with 73 per cent of those from private schools. Later, HEFCE admitted that it had made a transposition error, and that in fact, 73 per cent of state school graduates gained a first or upper second class degree compared with 82 per cent of private school graduates. This admission attracted far less publicity than the original erroneous assertion. Across all English universities, state school students who scored two Bs and a C at A-level did on average eight per cent better at degree level than their privately educated counterparts. Two Bs and a C represents an entry tariff of 112, well below the average demanded by any of the UK&#x27;s Russell Group universities.

<text>The &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; series is a series of four Western fiction novels written by Larry McMurtry and the five television miniseries and television series based upon them.

==Overview==
The novels and miniseries follow the exploits of several members of the Texas Ranger Division from the time of the Republic of Texas up until the beginning of the 20th century. Recurring characters include Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; McCrae, Woodrow F. Call, Joshua Deets, Pea Eye Parker, Jake Spoon, Clara Forsythe Allen, Maggie Tilton, Lorena Wood Parker, Blue Duck, and Buffalo Hump. The series is set within historical events and characters, although they are often adapted or altered to accommodate the fictional timelines of the main characters.

== History ==

=== Early days ===
Larry McMurtry was born into a cattle ranching family, and some of his uncles were old enough to have participated in the end of the cattle driving days. Before railroads went across the country, cattle drives had to be put on in order to move cattle to their set destinations. This timeframe is where the history of the cowboys originated from and eventually became romanticized. Larry McMurty realized being a cowboy was not as good as people made it out to be and decided to write a novel showing the hardships cowboys really faced. 

=== Creating &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; ===
Larry McMurtry originally planned to create a western screenplay called &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;, which would star John Wayne. This plan did not happen, and Larry McMurtry turned the screenplay into a novel. McMurtry took inspiration from Charles Goodnight&#x27;s 1860 cattle drives, &quot;The Log of a Cowboy&quot;, and Nelson Story&#x27;s 1866 drive from Texas to Montana.

== Summaries ==

=== &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; ===

&quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; follows two retired Texas Rangers, Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae who run the Hat Creek Cattle company. Woodrow Call realizes retirement does not suit him and grows restless. Gus does not mind retirement too much, but he does miss Clara, the love of his life, who currently lives up north in Nebraska. Then Jake Spoon, another former Ranger, tells them about the Milk River up in Montana and how beautiful it is up there. From this info, he convinces them to embark on a mission to drive cattle up to Montana. Here they would set up a ranch and live there. Jake Spoon would not go on this drive with them, but other notable people would. These people include, Pea eye, a former Ranger who worked under Call and Gus; Joshua Deets, a tracker and a former Ranger; Newt Dobbs, a boy who works for the Hat Creek Cattle Company; Lorena, a prostitute who resided in the town; and Bolivar a cook. Along their way they deal with crossing rivers, getting attacked by snakes, fighting off bears, and evading thunderstorms. However, an Indian known as Blue Duck causes many problems for the Hat Creek Cattle Company along the way. Eventually the group does complete their mission, but many of the men who embarked on the mission would die.

=== &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; ===
In &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;, Woodrow Call is hired by a railroad company, and is tasked with taking down Joey Garza, a skilled sniper who has been killing railroad workers. Ned Brookshire, a salaried man who works with the railroad company, accompanies Call on his mission. Call attempts to recruit Pea Eye, but he declines, as he now has a family and is married to Lorena. However, shortly after Call leaves, Pea eye’s guilty conscience convinces him to go after Call. As they get closer to Joey Garza they encounter more foes, such as Mox Mox, a man who used to work under Blue Duck. In the end Joey Garza is defeated, thus concluding the Lonesome Dove series.

=== &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot; ===
&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot; follows Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae (Gus) back in their younger days. On their first expedition the Rangers are stalked by Buffalo Hump, a Comanche Chief. After this expedition concludes, Call and Gus join another expedition led by a man named Colonel Cobb. The expedition started with 200 men, but quickly drops to 40 after many of them are either killed or desert. Shortly after being reduced to 40 men, they are captured by Mexican soldiers. Here, they are forced to march through the Dead Man&#x27;s Walk, at the end of the journey only 10 men survived. They are forced to partake in a grim ceremony, involving beans, which results in half of them being executed. Luckily Call and Gus survive, and the book ends with Gus and Call making it back to town where Clara lives.

=== &quot;Comanche Moon&quot; ===
&quot;Comanche Moon&quot; follows Gus and Call in the middle of their ranger years. This book also reintroduces Joshua Deets and Pea Eye. Here they work under Captain Inish Scull where they attempt to track down Kicking Wolf, a Comanche horse thief. However, a Mexican bandit named Ahumado captures Kicking Wolf before Inish Scull can. Eventually Inish Scull finds Kicking Wolf but frees him. Scull gets captured by Ahumado where he is put into a cage where he is expected to die. While this is going on Buffalo Hump leads an assault onto Austin. Before Inish Scull dies, or goes completely crazy, Call and Gus save him. The group then returns to Austin where Inish Scull is promoted General. Meanwhile, Ahumando is bitten by a poisonous spider and dies. After this, Blue Duck kills his father after he finds out that Buffalo Hump left them to go die.

==Television miniseries==
# &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; (1989)
# &quot;Return to Lonesome Dove&quot; (1993) – This miniseries is set a year after the events of &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;. The story was written by John Wilder. McMurtry was not involved in the production of this and he was not happy when CBS implied that he was a collaborator.

<doc id="238573" wikidata="Q377769" url="?curid=238573" title="Royal Marriages Act 1772">
<text>The Royal Marriages Act 1772 (12 Geo. 3. c. 11) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain which prescribed the conditions under which members of the British royal family could contract a valid marriage, in order to guard against marriages that could diminish the status of the royal house. The right of veto vested in the sovereign by this Act provoked severe adverse criticism at the time of its passage.

It was repealed as a result of the 2011 Perth Agreement, which came into force on 26 March 2015. Under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six people in the line of succession need permission to marry if they and their descendants are to remain in the line of succession.

==Provisions==
The Act said that no descendant of King George II, male or female, other than the issue of princesses who had married or might thereafter marry &quot;into foreign families&quot;, could marry without the consent of the reigning monarch, &quot;signified under the great seal and declared in council&quot;. That consent was to be set out in the licence and in the register of the marriage, and entered in the books of the Privy Council. Any marriage contracted without the consent of the monarch was to be null and void.

However, any member of the royal family over the age of 25 who had been refused the sovereign&#x27;s consent could marry one year after giving notice to the Privy Council of an intention so to marry, unless both houses of Parliament expressly declared their disapproval. There was, however, no instance in which the sovereign&#x27;s consent in Council was formally refused, though there was one where it was sought but the request ignored and others where it was not sought because it was likely to be refused.

The Act further made it a crime to perform or participate in an illegal marriage of any member of the royal family. This provision was repealed by the Criminal Law Act 1967.

==Rationale==

The Act was proposed by George III as a direct result of the marriage in 1771 of his brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, to the commoner Anne Horton, widow of Christopher Horton and daughter of the first Lord Irnham, MP. Royal assent was given to the Act on 1 April 1772, and it was only on 13 September following that the king learned that another brother, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, had in 1766 secretly married Maria, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole and the widow of the 2nd Earl Waldegrave. Both alliances were considered highly unsuitable by the king, who &quot;saw himself as having been forced to marry for purely dynastic reasons&quot;.

==Couples affected==

* On 15 December 1785, the King&#x27;s eldest son George, Prince of Wales, married privately and in contravention of this Act the twice-widowed Maria Anne Fitzherbert, a practising Catholic, at her house in Park Lane, London, according to the rites of the Church of England. This marriage was invalid under the Act. Had the marriage been valid, it would have excluded the Prince from succession to the throne under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, and made his brother Prince Frederick, Duke of York, the heir-apparent.
* On 29 September 1791, the King&#x27;s second son Prince Frederick, Duke of York, married Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia, at Charlottenburg, Berlin, but the ceremony had to be repeated in London on 23 November 1791 as, although consent had been given at the Privy Council on 28 September, it had proved impossible to obtain the Great Seal in time and doubt had thus been thrown on the legality of the marriage.
* On 4 April 1793, Prince Augustus, the sixth son of the King, married Lady Augusta Murray, in contravention of the Act, first privately and without witnesses, according to the rites of the Church of England at the Hotel Sarmiento, Rome, and again, after banns, on 5 December 1793, at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London. Both marriages were declared null and void by the Court of Arches on 14 July 1794, and the two resulting children were subsequently considered illegitimate.
* After the death of Lady Augusta Murray, Prince Augustus, now Duke of Sussex, apparently married (no contemporary evidence survives), again in contravention of the Act, about 2 May 1831, at her house in Great Cumberland Place, London, Lady Cecilia Buggin, who on that day had taken the surname Underwood in lieu of Buggin and who, on 10 April 1840, was created Duchess of Inverness by Queen Victoria (the Duke being Earl of Inverness). The Queen had thereby, as Lord Melbourne wrote, &quot;recognized the moral and religious effect of whatever has taken place whilst she avoided the legal effects of a legal marriage which was what her Majesty was most anxious to do&quot;. Acceptance of the marriage would have meant acceptance of the Duke&#x27;s earlier marriage and the legitimacy of his two children. However, the couple cohabited and were socially accepted as husband and wife.
* On 8 January 1847, the Queen&#x27;s first cousin Prince George of Cambridge married, by licence of the Faculty Office but in contravention of this Act, Sarah Fairbrother, a pregnant actress with four illegitimate children (two by himself and two by other men), at St James, Clerkenwell. From about 1858, Fairbrother took the name Mrs FitzGeorge. The marriage was invalid, not a morganatic marriage as many have called it. It is also incorrect to say that Queen Victoria refused to consent to this marriage, as no application was made to her under the Act, it being very apparent that no consent would be given.
* After Charles Edward, Duke of Albany was deprived of his British titles under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 due to his German loyalties during World War I, his descendants married without consent from the British monarch (the earliest in 1932). As Charles Edward was a male-line grandson of Queen Victoria, application of the Royal Marriages Act as written renders null and void for the purposes of British law the marriages of his children, despite having been lawfully contracted in Germany.
* The only known case in which permission to marry was withheld by the British sovereign despite a formal request under the Royal Marriages Act is that of Prince George William of Hanover, a German citizen descended from King George III, whose father and grandfather were deprived of their British titles under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 due to their German loyalties during World War I. On 23 April 1946, George William married Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark, who was about to become a kinswoman to the British royal family as her brother Prince Philip was courting the future Queen Elizabeth II. Their request for permission from King George VI received no response due to sensitivity over the fact that a state of war still existed between the United Kingdom and Germany, and it was held by British officials at the time that the marriage and its issue would not be legitimate in the United Kingdom despite being legal in Germany.

==Broad effects==
The Act rendered void any marriage wherever contracted or solemnised in contravention of it. A member of the royal family who contracted a marriage that violated the Act did &quot;not&quot; thereby lose his or her place in the line of succession, but the offspring of such a union were made illegitimate by the voiding of the marriage and thus lost any right to succeed.

The Act applied to Catholics, even though they are ineligible to succeed to the throne. It did not apply to descendants of Sophia of Hanover who are not also descendants of George II, even though they are still eligible to succeed to the throne.

It had been claimed that the marriage of Prince Augustus had been legal in Ireland and Hanover, but the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords ruled (in the Sussex Peerage Case, 9 July 1844) that the Act incapacitated the descendants of George II from contracting a legal marriage without the consent of the Crown, either within the British dominions or elsewhere.

All European monarchies, and many non-European realms, have laws or traditions requiring prior approval of the monarch for members of the reigning dynasty to marry. But Britain&#x27;s was unusual because it was never modified between its original enactment and its repeal 243 years later, so that its grew rather wide, affecting not only the British royal family, but more distant relatives of the monarch.

==Farran exemption==
In the 1950s, Charles d&#x27;Olivier Farran, Lecturer in Constitutional Law at Liverpool University, theorised that the act could no longer apply to anyone living, because all the members of the immediate royal family were descended from British princesses who had married into foreign families. The loophole is due to the act&#x27;s wording, whereby if a person is, through one line, a descendant of George II subject to the act&#x27;s restriction, but is &quot;also&quot;, separately through another line, a descendant of a British princess married into a foreign family, the exemption for the latter reads as if it trumps the former.

Many of George II&#x27;s descendants in female lines have married back into the British royal family. In particular, Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the House of Windsor descend through Queen Alexandra from two daughters of King George II, Princesses Mary and Louise, who married foreign rulers, respectively Landgrave Frederick II of Hesse-Kassel and King Frederick V of Denmark, and through Queen Mary from a third, Princess Anne, who married Prince William IV of Orange. Queen Mary herself was a product of such a marriage; her parents were Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, a granddaughter of George III and Francis, Duke of Teck, a minor German prince of the House of Württemberg. Moreover, King Charles III, his issue, siblings, and their issue descend from yet another such marriage, that of Princess Alice, a daughter of Queen Victoria, to Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse, through their great-grandson Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

This so-called &quot;Farran exemption&quot; met with wide publicity, but arguments against it were put forward by Clive Parry, Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge, and Farran&#x27;s interpretation has since been ignored. Consent to marriages in the royal family (including the distantly related House of Hanover) continued to be sought and granted as if none of the agnatic descendants of George II were also his cognatic descendants.

Parry argued that the &quot;Farran exemption&quot; theory was complicated by the fact that all the Protestant descendants of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, ancestress of the United Kingdom&#x27;s monarchs since 1714, had been entitled to British citizenship under the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705 (if born prior to 1949, when the act was repealed). Thus, some marriages of British princesses to continental monarchs and princes were not, in law, marriages to foreigners. For example, the 1947 marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, by birth a Greek and Danish prince but descended from the Electress Sophia, was a marriage to a British subject even if he had not been previously naturalised in Britain. This would also mean theoretically, for example, that the present royal family of Norway was bound by the Act, for the marriage of Princess Maud, a daughter of King Edward VII, to the future King Haakon VII of Norway, was a marriage to a &quot;British subject&quot;, since Haakon descended from the Electress Sophia.

==Exemption of the former Edward VIII==

In 1936 the statute His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 specifically excluded Edward VIII from the provisions of this act upon his abdication, allowing him to marry the divorcée, Wallis Simpson. The wording of the statute also excluded any issue of the marriage both from being subject to the act, and from the succession to the throne; no marriages or succession rights were ultimately affected by this language, as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor had no children.

==Perth Agreement==

In October 2011 David Cameron wrote to the leaders of the other Commonwealth realms proposing that the Act be limited to the first six people in line to the throne. The leaders approved the proposed change at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Perth, Western Australia.

The legislation in a number of Commonwealth realms repeals the Royal Marriages Act 1772 in its entirety. It was, in the United Kingdom, replaced by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which stipulates a requirement for the first six people in the line of succession to obtain the sovereign&#x27;s consent before marrying in order to remain eligible. Article 3(5) of the new Act also provides that, except for succession purposes, any marriage that would have been void under the original Act &quot;is to be treated as never having been void&quot; if it did not involve any of the first six people in the line of succession at the time of the marriage; royal consent was never sought or denied; &quot;in all the circumstances it was reasonable for the person concerned not to have been aware at the time of the marriage that the Act applied to it&quot;; and no one has acted on the basis that the marriage is void. New Zealand&#x27;s Royal Succession Act 2013 repealed the Royal Marriages Act and provided for royal consent for the first six people in the line of succession to be granted by the monarch in right of the United Kingdom.

==Other legislation==
The Regency Act 1830, which provided for a regency in the event that Queen Victoria inherited the throne before she was eighteen, made it illegal for her to marry without the regent&#x27;s consent. Her spouse and anyone involved in arranging or conducting the marriage without such consent would be guilty of high treason. This was more serious than the offence created by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which was equivalent to praemunire. However, the Regency Act 1830 never came into force, as Victoria had already turned 18 a few weeks before becoming queen.

==Consents for marriages under the act==

Consents under the act were entered in the Books of the Privy Council but have not been published. In 1857 it became customary to publish them in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; and notices appear of consents given in Council at Courts held on the following dates. Not all consents were there and gaps in the list have been filled by reference to the Warrants for Royal Marriages in the Home Office papers (series HO 124) in The National Archives:
