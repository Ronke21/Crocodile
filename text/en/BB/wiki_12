<text>The Gupta Empire was an Indian empire during the classical period of the Indian subcontinent which existed from the mid 3rd century to mid 6th century CE. At its zenith, the dynasty ruled over an empire that spanned much of the northern Indian subcontinent. This period has been considered as the Golden Age of India by some historians, although this characterisation has been disputed by others. The ruling dynasty of the empire was founded by Gupta.

The high points of this period are the great cultural developments which took place primarily during the reigns of Samudragupta, Chandragupta II and Kumaragupta I. Many Hindu epics and literary sources, such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana, were canonised during this period. The Gupta period produced scholars such as Kalidasa, Aryabhata, Varahamihira and Vatsyayana, who made significant advancements in many academic fields. Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. The period, sometimes described as &quot;Pax Gupta&quot;, gave rise to achievements in architecture, sculpture, and painting that &quot;set standards of form and taste [that] determined the whole subsequent course of art, not only in India but far beyond her borders&quot;. Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural centre and established the region as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions in India and Southeast Asia. The Puranas, earlier long poems on a variety of subjects, are also thought to have been committed to written texts around this period. Hinduism was followed by the rulers and the Brahmins flourished in the Gupta empire but the Guptas were tolerant towards people of other faiths as well.

The empire eventually died out because of factors such as substantial loss of territory and imperial authority caused by their own erstwhile feudatories, as well as the invasion by the Huna peoples (Kidarites and Alchon Huns) from Central Asia. After the collapse of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century, India was again ruled by numerous regional kingdoms.

==Origin==
The homeland of the Guptas is uncertain. According to one theory, they originated in the present-day lower-Doab region of Uttar Pradesh, where most of the inscriptions and coin hoards of the early Gupta emperors have been discovered. This theory is also supported by the Purana, as argued by the proponents, that mention the territory of the early Gupta emperors as Prayaga, Saketa, and Magadha areas in the Ganges basin. The recently found silver coin of Sri Gupta in Uttar Pradesh further attest the origin of Guptas around Kāśī–Kannauj region and his rule was only limited to Kāśī (present day Varanasi).

Another prominent theory locates the Gupta homeland in the present-day Bengal region in Ganges basin, based on the account of the 7th-century Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing. According to Yijing, king Che-li-ki-to (identified with the dynasty&#x27;s founder &quot;Shri&quot; Gupta) built a temple for Chinese pilgrims near Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no (apparently a transcription of Mriga-shikha-vana). Yijing states that this temple was located more than 40 &quot;yojanas&quot; east of Nalanda, which would mean it was situated somewhere in the modern Bengal region. Another proposal is that the early Gupta kingdom extended from Prayaga in the west to northern Bengal in the east.

The Gupta records do not mention the dynasty&#x27;s varna (social class). Some historians, such as A.S. Altekar, have theorised that they were of Vaishya origin, as certain ancient Indian texts prescribe the name &quot;Gupta&quot; for the members of the Vaishya varna. According to historian R. S. Sharma, the Vaishyas – who were traditionally associated with trade – may have become rulers after resisting oppressive taxation by the previous rulers. Critics of the Vaishya-origin theory point out that the suffix Gupta features in the names of several non-Vaishyas before as well as during the Gupta period, and the dynastic name &quot;Gupta&quot; may have simply derived from the name of the dynasty&#x27;s first king Gupta. Some scholars, such as S. R. Goyal, theorise that the Guptas were Brahmins, because they had matrimonial relations with Brahmins, but others reject this evidence as inconclusive. Based on the Pune and Riddhapur inscriptions of the Gupta princess Prabhavatigupta, some scholars believe that the name of her paternal gotra (clan) was &quot;Dharana&quot;, but an alternative reading of these inscriptions suggests that Dharana was the &quot;gotra&quot; of her mother Kuberanaga.

==History==
=== Early rulers ===
 &quot;gu-pta&quot;, ) is the earliest known king of the Gupta dynasty. Different historians variously date the beginning of his reign from the mid-to-late 3rd century CE. Gupta founded the Gupta Empire -280 CE, and was succeeded by his son, Ghatotkacha, -319 CE, followed by Ghatotkacha&#x27;s son, Chandragupta I, -335 CE. &quot;Che-li-ki-to&quot;, the name of a king mentioned by the 7th century Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing, is believed to be a transcription of &quot;Shri-Gupta&quot; (IAST: Śrigupta), &quot;Shri&quot; being an honorific prefix. According to Yijing, this king built a temple for Chinese Buddhist pilgrims near &quot;Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no&quot; (believed to be a transcription of Mṛgaśikhāvana).

Gupta (Gupta script: 
In the Allahabad Pillar inscription, Gupta and his successor Ghatotkacha are described as &quot;Maharaja&quot; (&quot;Great King&quot;), while the next king Chandragupta I is called a Maharajadhiraja (&quot;King of Great Kings&quot;). In the later period, the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; was used by feudatory rulers, which has led to suggestions that Gupta and Ghatotkacha were vassals (possibly of the Kushan Empire). However, there are several instances of paramount sovereigns using the title &quot;Maharaja&quot;, in both pre-Gupta and post-Gupta periods, so this cannot be said with certainty. That said, there is no doubt that Gupta and Ghatotkacha held a lower status and were less powerful than Chandragupta I.

Chandragupta I married the Licchavi princess Kumaradevi, which may have helped him extend his political power and dominions, enabling him to adopt the prestigious title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;. According to the dynasty&#x27;s official records, he was succeeded by his son Samudragupta. However, the discovery of the coins issued by a Gupta emperor named Kacha have led to some debate on this topic: according to one theory, Kacha was another name for Samudragupta; another possibility is that Kacha was a rival claimant to the throne.

===Samudragupta===
Samudragupta succeeded his father around 335 or 350 CE, and ruled until . The Allahabad Pillar inscription, composed by his courtier Harisena, credits him with extensive conquests. The inscription asserts that Samudragupta uprooted 8 kings of Āryāvarta, the northern region, including the Nagas. It further claims that he subjugated all the kings of the forest region, which was most probably located in central India. It also credits him with defeating 12 rulers of Dakshinapatha, the southern region: the exact identification of several of these kings is debated among modern scholars, but it is clear that these kings ruled areas located on the eastern coast of India. The inscription suggests that Samudragupta advanced as far as the Pallava kingdom in the south, and defeated Vishnugopa, the Pallava regent of Kanchi. During this southern campaign, Samudragupta most probably passed through the forest tract of central India, reached the eastern coast in present-day Odisha, and then marched south along the coast of the Bay of Bengal.

The Allahabad Pillar inscription mentions that rulers of several frontier kingdoms and tribal aristocracies paid Samudragupta tributes, obeyed his orders, and performed obeisance before him. These polities and tribes included Samatata, Davaka, Kamarupa, Nepal, Karttripura, Malavas, Arjunayanas, Yaudheyas, Madrakas, and Abhiras.

The inscription also mentions that several foreign kings tried to please Samudragupta by personal attendance, offered him their daughters in marriage (or according to another interpretation, gifted him maidens), and sought the use of the Garuda-depicting Gupta seal for administering their own territories. However, this is likely an exaggeration, and Samudragupta&#x27;s panegyrist appears to have described acts of diplomacy as ones of subservience. For example, the King of Simhala is listed among these foreign rulers, but it is known that from Chinese sources that the Simhala king Meghavarna merely sent presents to the Gupta emperor requesting his permission to build a Buddhist monastery; he did not express subservience.

Samudragupta appears to have been Vaishnavite, as attested by his Eran inscription, and performed several Brahmanical ceremonies. The Gupta records credit him with making generous donations of cows and gold. He performed the Ashvamedha ritual (horse sacrifice), which was used by the ancient Indian kings and emperors to prove their imperial sovereignty, and issued gold coins (see Coinage below) to mark this performance.

The Allahabad Pillar inscription presents Samudragupta as a wise king and strict administrator, who was also compassionate enough to help the poor and the helpless. It also alludes to the king&#x27;s talents as a musician and a poet, and calls him the &quot;king of poets&quot;. Such claims are corroborated by Samudragupta&#x27;s gold coins, which depict him playing a veena.

Samudragupta appears to have directly controlled a large part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain in present-day India, as well as a substantial part of central India. His empire comprised a number of monarchical and tribal tributary states of northern India, and of the south-eastern coastal region of India.

=== Ramagupta ===
Ramagupta is known from a sixth-century play, the &quot;Devichandragupta&quot;, in which he surrenders his queen to the enemy Sakas, forcing his brother Chandragupta to sneak into the enemy camp to rescue her and kill the Saka king. The historicity of these events is unclear, but Ramagupta&#x27;s existence is confirmed by three Jain statues found at Durjanpur, with inscriptions referring to him as the &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;. A large number of his copper coins also have been found from the Eran-Vidisha region and classified in five distinct types, which include the &quot;Garuda&quot;, &quot;Garudadhvaja&quot;, &quot;lion&quot; and &quot;border legend&quot; types. The Brahmi legends on these coins are written in the early Gupta style.

===Chandragupta II &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;===

According to the Gupta records, among his sons, Samudragupta nominated prince Chandragupta II, born of queen Dattadevi, as his successor. Chandragupta II, &quot;Vikramaditya&quot; (Brave as the Sun), ruled from 375 until 415. He married a Kadamba princess of Kuntala and of Naga lineage (&quot;Nāgakulotpannnā&quot;), Kuberanaga. His daughter Prabhavatigupta from this Naga queen was married to Rudrasena II, the Vakataka king of Deccan. His son Kumaragupta I was married to a Kadamba princess of the Karnataka region. Chandragupta II expanded his realm westwards, defeating the Saka Western Kshatrapas of Malwa, Gujarat and Saurashtra in a campaign lasting until 409. His main opponent Rudrasimha III was defeated by 395, and he crushed the Bengal chiefdoms. This extended his control from coast to coast, established a second capital at Ujjain and was the high point of the empire. Kuntala inscriptions indicate rule of Chandragupta II in Kuntala country of Karnataka. Hunza inscription also indicate that Chandragupta was able to rule north western Indian subcontinent and proceeded to conquer Balkh, although some scholars have also disputed the identity of the Gupta emperor. Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI (r. 1076 – 1126 CE) mentions Chandragupta with his title and states: &quot;Why should the glory of the Kings Vikramaditya and Nanda be a hindrance any longer? He with a loud command abolished that (era), which has the name of Saka, and made that (era) which has the Chalukya counting&quot;.
Despite the creation of the empire through war, his reign is remembered for its very influential style of Hindu art, literature, culture and science. Some excellent works of Hindu art such as the panels at the Dashavatara Temple in Deogarh serve to illustrate the magnificence of Gupta art during his reign. Above all, it was the synthesis of elements that gave Gupta art its distinctive flavour. During this period, the Guptas were supportive of thriving Buddhist and Jain cultures as well, and for this reason, there is also a long history of non-Hindu Gupta period art. In particular, Gupta period Buddhist art was to be influential in most of East and Southeast Asia. Many advances were recorded by the Chinese scholar and traveller Faxian in his diary and published afterwards.

The court of Chandragupta II was made even more illustrious by the fact that it was graced by the &quot;Navaratna&quot; (Nine Jewels), a group of nine who excelled in the literary arts. Among these men was Kālidāsa, whose works dwarfed the works of many other literary geniuses, not only in his own age but in the years to come. Kalidasa was mainly known for his subtle exploitation of the &quot;shringara&quot; (romantic) element in his verse.

====Campaigns against foreign tribes====

The 4th century Sanskrit poet Kalidasa credits Chandragupta Vikramaditya with conquering about twenty-one kingdoms, both in and outside India. After finishing his campaign in East and West India, Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) proceeded northwards, subjugated the Parasika, then the Huna and Kamboja tribes located in the west and east Oxus valleys respectively. Thereafter, the king proceeded into the Himalaya mountains to reduce the mountain tribes of the Kinnaras, Kiratas, as well as India proper. In one of his works Kalidasa also credits him with the removal of the Sakas from the country. He wrote &#x27;Wasn&#x27;t it Vikramaditya who drove the Sakas out from the lovely city of Ujjain?&#x27;.

The &quot;Brihatkathamanjari&quot; of the Kashmiri writer Kshemendra states, King Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) had &quot;unburdened the sacred earth of the barbarians like the Sakas, Mlecchas, Kambojas, Greeks, Tusharas, Saka-Greeks, Hunas, and others, by annihilating these sinful Mlecchas completely&quot;.

====Faxian====
Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist monk, was one of the pilgrims who visited India during the reign of the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II. He started his journey from China in 399 and reached India in 405 . During his stay in India up to 411 , he went on a pilgrimage to Mathura, Kannauj, Kapilavastu, Kushinagar, Vaishali, Pataliputra, Kashi, and Rajagriha, and made careful observations about the empire&#x27;s conditions. Faxian was pleased with the mildness of administration. The penal code was mild, and offences were punished by fines only. From his accounts, the Gupta Empire was a prosperous period. His writings form one of the most important sources for the history of this period.

Faxian on reaching Mathura comments––&quot;The snow and heat are finely tempered, and there is neither hoarfrost nor snow. The people are numerous and happy. They have not to register their households. Only those who cultivate the royal land have to pay (a portion of) the gain from it. If they want to go, they go. If they want to stay on, they stay on. The king governs without decapitation or (other) corporal punishments. Criminals are simply fined according to circumstances. Even in cases of repeated attempts at wicked rebellion, they only have their right-hand cut off. The king&#x27;s bodyguards &amp; attendants all have salaries. Throughout the whole country, the people do not kill any living creature, not drink any intoxicating liquor, nor eat onions or garlic.&quot;

===Kumaragupta I===

Chandragupta II was succeeded by his second son Kumaragupta I, born of &quot;Mahadevi&quot; Dhruvasvamini. Kumaragupta I assumed the title, &quot;Mahendraditya&quot;. He ruled until 455. Towards the end of his reign a tribe in the Narmada valley, the Pushyamitras, rose in power to threaten the empire. The Kidarites as well probably confronted the Gupta Empire towards the end of the rule of Kumaragupta I, as his son Skandagupta mentions in the Bhitari pillar inscription his efforts at reshaping a country in disarray, through reorganisation and military victories over the Pushyamitras and the Hunas.

He was the founder of Nalanda University which on 15 July 2016 was declared as a UNESCO world heritage site. Kumaragupta I was also a worshipper of Kartikeya.

===Skandagupta===

Skandagupta, son and successor of Kumaragupta I is generally considered to be the last of the great Gupta emperors. He assumed the titles of &quot;Vikramaditya&quot; and &quot;Kramaditya&quot;. He defeated the Pushyamitra threat, but then was faced with invading Kidarites (sometimes described as the Hephthalites or &quot;White Huns&quot;, known in India as the Sweta Huna), from the northwest.

He repelled a &quot;Huna&quot; attack around 455 CE, but the expense of the wars drained the empire&#x27;s resources and contributed to its decline. The Bhitari Pillar inscription of Skandagupta, the successor of Chandragupta, recalls the near annihilation of the Gupta Empire following the attacks of the Kidarites. The Kidarites seem to have retained the western part of the Gupta Empire.

Skandagupta died in 467 and was succeeded by his agnate brother Purugupta.

===Decline of the empire===

Following Skandagupta&#x27;s death, the empire was clearly in decline, and the later Gupta coinage indicates their loss of control over much of western India after 467–469. Skandagupta was followed by Purugupta (467–473), Kumaragupta II (473–476), Budhagupta (476–495), Narasimhagupta (495–530), Kumaragupta III (530–540), Vishnugupta (540–550), two lesser known kings namely, Vainyagupta and Bhanugupta.

In the late 490&#x27;s the Alchon Huns under Toramana and Mihirakula broke through the Gupta defences in the northwest, and much of the empire in the northwest was overrun by the Huns by 500. According to some scholars the empire disintegrated under the attacks of Toramana and his successor Mihirakula. It appears from inscriptions that the Guptas, although their power was much diminished, continued to resist the Huns. The Hun invader Toramana was defeated by Bhanugupta in 510. The Huns were defeated and driven out of India in 528 by King Yashodharman from Malwa, and possibly Gupta emperor Narasimhagupta.

These invasions, although only spanning a few decades, had long term effects on India, and in a sense brought an end to Classical Indian civilisation. Soon after the invasions, the Gupta Empire, already weakened by these invasions and the rise of local rulers such as Yashodharman, ended as well. Following the invasions, northern India was left in disarray, with numerous smaller Indian powers emerging after the crumbling of the Guptas. The Huna invasions are said to have seriously damaged India&#x27;s trade with Europe and Central Asia. In particular, Indo-Roman trade relations, which the Gupta Empire had greatly benefited from. The Guptas had been exporting numerous luxury products such as silk, leather goods, fur, iron products, ivory, pearl, and pepper from centres such as Nasik, Paithan, Pataliputra, and Benares. The Huna invasion probably disrupted these trade relations and the tax revenues that came with them.

Furthermore, Indian urban culture was left in decline, and Buddhism, gravely weakened by the destruction of monasteries and the killing of monks by the hand of the vehemently anti-Buddhist Shaivist Huna king Mihirakula, started to collapse. Great centres of learning were destroyed, such as the city of Taxila, bringing cultural regression. During their rule of 60 years, the Alchons are said to have altered the hierarchy of ruling families and the Indian caste system. For example, the Hunas are often said to have become the precursors of the Rajputs.
The succession of the 6th-century Guptas is not entirely clear, but the tail end recognised ruler of the dynasty&#x27;s main line was King Vishnugupta, reigning from 540 to 550. In addition to the Huna invasion, the factors, which contribute to the decline of the empire include competition from the Vakatakas and the rise of Yashodharman in Malwa.

The last known inscription by a Gupta emperor is from the reign of Vishnugupta (the Damudarpur copper-plate inscription), in which he makes a land grant in the area of Kotivarsha (Bangarh in West Bengal) in 542/543 CE. This follows the occupation of most of northern and central India by the Aulikara King Yashodharman .

Archaeologist Shanker Sharma concluded, based on a 2019 study, that the cause of the Gupta Empire&#x27;s downfall was a devastating flood which happened around the middle of the 6th century in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

===Post-Gupta successor dynasties===
In the heart of the former Gupta Empire, in the Gangetic region, the Guptas were succeeded by the Maukhari dynasty and the Pushyabhuti dynasty. The coinage of the Maukharis and Pushyabhutis followed the silver coin type of the Guptas, with portrait of the ruler in profile (although facing in the reverse direction compared to the Guptas, a possible symbol of antagonism) and the peacock on the reverse, the Brahmi legend being kept except for the name of the ruler.

In the western regions, they were succeeded by Gurjaradesa, the Gurjara-Pratiharas, and later the Chaulukya-Paramara dynasties, who issued so-called Indo-Sasanian coinage, on the model of the coinage of the Sasanian Empire, which had been introduced in India by the Alchon Huns.

== Military ==
In contrast to the Maurya Empire, the Guptas introduced several military innovations to Indian warfare. Chief among these was the use of siege engines, heavy cavalry archers and heavy sword cavalry. Heavy cavalry formed the core of the Gupta Army and were supported by the traditional Indian Army elements of war elephants and light infantry.

The utilisation of horse archers in the Gupta period is evidenced on the coinage of Chandragupta II, Kumaragupta I and Prakasaditya (postulated to be Purugupta) that depicts the kings as horse-archers.

There is a paucity of contemporary sources detailing the tactical operations of the Imperial Gupta Army. The best extant information comes from the Sanskrit mahakavya (epic poem) Raghuvaṃśa written by the Classical Sanskrit writer and dramatist Kalidasa. Many modern scholars put forward the view that Kalidasa lived from the reign of Chandragupta II to the reign of Skandagupta and that the campaigns of Raghu – his protagonist in the Raghuvaṃśa – reflect those of Chandragupta II. In Canto IV of the Raghuvamsa, Kalidasa relates how the king&#x27;s forces clash against the powerful, cavalry-centric, forces of the Persians and later the Yavanas (probably Huns) in the North-West. Here he makes special mention of the use horse-archers in the king&#x27;s army and that the horses needed much rest after the hotly contested battles. The five arms of the Gupta military included infantry, cavalry, chariotry, elephantry and ships. &quot;Gunaighar&quot; copper plate inscription of Vainya Gupta mentions ships but not chariots.

==Religion==

The Guptas were traditionally a Hindu dynasty. They were patronizers of Brahmanism and allowed followers of Buddhism and Jainism to practice their religions. Sanchi remained an important centre of Buddhism. Kumaragupta I (455 ) is said to have founded Nalanda. Modern genetic studies indicate that it was during the Gupta period that Indian caste groups ceased to intermarry (started practising/enforcing endogamy).

Some later rulers however seem to have especially promoted Buddhism. Narasimhagupta Baladitya (–?), according to contemporary writer Paramartha, was brought up under the influence of the Mahayanist philosopher, Vasubandhu. He built a sangharama at Nalanda and also a high vihara with a Buddha statue within which, according to Xuanzang, resembled the &quot;great Vihara built under the Bodhi tree&quot;. According to the &quot;Manjushrimulakalpa&quot; (), King Narasimhsagupta became a Buddhist monk, and left the world through meditation (Dhyana). The Chinese monk Xuanzang also noted that Narasimhagupta Baladitya&#x27;s son, Vajra, who commissioned a sangharama as well, &quot;possessed a heart firm in faith&quot;.

==Administration==
A study of the epigraphical records of the Gupta Empire shows that there was a hierarchy of administrative divisions from top to bottom. It was divided into 26 provinces, which were called &quot;Bhukti&quot;, &quot;Desha&quot; or &quot;Rajya&quot;. Provinces were also divided into &quot;vishayas&quot; or &quot;pradeshas&quot; (districts) and put under the control of &quot;Vishayapati&quot;s (district lords). A &quot;Vishayapati&quot; administered the &quot;Vishaya&quot; with the help of the &quot;Adhikarana&quot; (council of representatives), which comprised four representatives: &quot;Nagarasreshesthi&quot;, &quot;Sarthavaha&quot;, &quot;Prathamakulika&quot; and &quot;Prathama Kayastha&quot;. A part of the &quot;Vishaya&quot; was called &quot;Vithi&quot;. The Gupta also had trading links with the Sassanid and Byzantine Empires. The four-fold varna system was observed under the Gupta period but caste system was fluid. Brahmins followed non-Brahmanical professions as well. Kshatriyas were involved in trade and commerce. The society largely coexisted among themselves.

=== Urban centres ===
Gupta administration proved to be highly conducive for the rapid growth of urban centres. The principal and original capital of the Gupta Empire is regarded to be Prayag. In the fifth century, the capital was moved to Ayodhya under either Kumaragupta or Skandagupta. Chandragupta Vikramaditya took personal interest in the development of Ujjain as a major cultural center after its conquest. Kāśī is sometimes considered by some scholars to have been a capital, either as the original capital, the principal late 6th-century capital or a minor later capital. The Chinese author Faxian described Magadha as a prosperous country with rich towns and large populations.

==Legacy==

=== Mathematics ===
Indian mathematics flourished in the Gupta Empire. The Indian numerals which were the first positional base 10 numeral systems in the world originated from Gupta India. The Surya Siddhanta contains the Sine table. Aryabhata wrote the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, making significant contributions to mathematics including developing a Place value system, an approximation of π of 4 decimal places, trigonometric functions, and Squared triangular numbers. Varāhamihira wrote the &quot;Pancha Siddhanta&quot; developing various formulas relating sine and cosine functions. Yativṛṣabha made contributions on units of measurement. Virahanka described Fibonacci numbers.

=== Astronomy ===
Indian astronomy also saw progress in this era. The names of the seven days in a week appeared at the start of the Gupta period based on Hindu deities and planets corresponding to the Roman names. Aryabhata made several contributions such as assigning the start of each day to midnight. the earth&#x27;s rotation on its axis, westward motion of the stars. Aryabhata also mentioned that reflected sunlight is the cause behind the shining of the Moon. In his book, Aryabhata, he suggested that the Earth was sphere, containing a circumference of 24,835 miles (39,967 km). Varāhamihira approximates the method for determination of the meridian direction from any three positions of the shadow using a gnomon.

=== Medicine ===
The Sushruta Samhita, which is a Sanskrit redaction text on all of the major concepts of Ayurveda medicine with innovative chapters on surgery, dates to the Gupta period.

=== Metallurgy and Engineering ===
The Iron Pillar of Delhi high resistance to corrosion . The corrosion resistance results from an even layer of crystalline iron(III) hydrogen phosphate hydrate forming on the high-phosphorus-content iron, which serves to protect it from the effects of the corrosion The earliest evidence of the cotton gin was found in the fifth century, in the form of Buddhist paintings depicting a single-roller gin in the Ajanta Caves. The gins consisted of a single roller made of iron or wood and a flat piece of stone or wood.

=== Education ===
Various Mahavihara operated throughout the Gupta Empire serving as centuries of education. Nalanda played a vital role in promoting the patronage of arts and academics during the 5th and 6th century CE.

=== Literature ===
The highest point of Sanskrit literature is also said to have belonged to this period. Harisena was an early writer of Kāvya poetry. his works include &quot;Apabramsa Dharmapariksa&quot;, &quot;Karpuraprakara&quot; (&quot;Suktavall&quot;), the medical treatise &quot;Jagatsundari-Yogamaladhikara&quot;, &quot;Yasodharacanta&quot;, &quot;Astahnikakatha&quot; and &quot;Brhatkathakosa&quot;. Amarasimha wrote various on Sanskrit grammar. Kalidasa, a playwright, wrote plays such as the Abhijnanashakuntalam and Shakuntala. Bhartṛhari published major works including the &quot;Trikāṇḍī&quot; and &quot;Śatakatraya.&quot;

=== Leisure ===
Chess is said to have developed in this period. Its early form in the 6th century, &quot;&quot;, which translates as &quot;four divisions [of the military]&quot; (infantry, cavalry, chariotry, and elephantry), was represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, rook, and bishop respectively. Doctors also invented several medical instruments, and even performed surgical operations. The ancient Gupta text Kama Sutra by the Indian scholar Vatsyayana is widely considered to be the standard work on human sexual behaviour in Sanskrit literature.

=== Art and architecture ===
The Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak of North Indian art for all the major religious groups. Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculptures. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha-figure and Jain &quot;tirthankara&quot; figures, the latter often on a very large scale. The two great centres of sculpture were Mathura and Gandhara, the latter the centre of Greco-Buddhist art. Both exported sculpture to other parts of northern India.

The most famous remaining monuments in a broadly Gupta style, the caves at Ajanta, Elephanta, and Ellora (respectively Buddhist, Hindu, and mixed including Jain) were in fact produced under later dynasties, but primarily reflect the monumentality and balance of Gupta style. Ajanta contains by far the most significant survivals of painting from this and the surrounding periods, showing a mature form which had probably had a long development, mainly in painting palaces. The Hindu Udayagiri Caves actually record connections with the dynasty and its ministers, and the Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh is a major temple, one of the earliest to survive, with important sculpture.

<text>Frans Pourbus the Younger or Frans Pourbus (II) (Antwerp, 1569 – Paris, 1622) was a Flemish painter, specialised in portrait painting. He was the third generation of a prominent family of religious and portrait painters.

Pourbus was a successful court painter for, successively, the Archdukes in Brussels, the Gonzaga Duke of Mantua (1600–1609), and then the French court. The majority of his work was royal portraits, many full-length, but he also painted some altarpieces. He painted the Brussels-based Spanish Regents of the Netherlands, the Duke of Mantua and Marie de&#x27; Medici, Queen of France.

Pourbus produced portraits that were pleasing to his patrons, but somewhat static with no dramatic situations, or landscape backgrounds. He is noted for his depiction of costume, jewellery and draperies, as in his portrait of Henry IV of France (below).

==Life==
Frans was born in Antwerp as the son of Frans the Elder (1545 – 1581) and Suzanna Floris. Both his parents came from prominent artist families. His father was an important portrait and genre painter and his grandfather Pieter Pourbus (1523 – 1584) was the leading portrait and history painter in Bruges in the second half of the 16th century. His mother was a niece of his father&#x27;s master, the Antwerp painter Frans Floris and daughter of Cornelis Floris de Vriendt, an influential sculptor and architect. He had two younger sisters. His mother died in 1674 after which his father remarried and had another son. His father died at the young age of 36 when Frans was only 12. There is no record of his artistic training, but he was likely an apprentice in his grandfather&#x27;s workshop. He was admitted as a master in the Guild of St. Luke of Antwerp in the guild year 1591–92, when he was 22.

At the end of the 16th century, he worked for Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella in Brussels. On 27 June 1600, he was paid for a portrait of the Infanta. This work was subsequently presented to Anne of Denmark (wife of James VI and I) by the Ambassador of the Spanish Netherlands and remains in the Royal Collection until today.

In 1600, he was recruited as court painter in Mantua by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua who met him when Gonzaga was on a visit to the Netherlands buying works of art. Within months of his appointment, Peter Paul Rubens arrived at the Mantuan court, but there is no evidence of hostility between the two. In 1609, Pourbus moved to Paris at the instigation of Marie de&#x27; Medici, Queen of Franc. It was here that he perfected his style. He worked as Marie de&#x27; Medici, Queen of France&#x27;s court painter until his death.

== Death ==
He died in Paris and was buried on 19 February 1622.The exact date of his death is unknown.

==Work==
Works of his can be found in the Royal Collection, the National Museum in Warsaw, the Louvre, the Prado, the Rijksmuseum, the Royal College of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<text>Hibiscus is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as &quot;hibiscus&quot;, or less widely known as rose mallow. The genus includes both annual and perennial herbaceous plants, as well as woody shrubs and small trees.

Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably &quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot; and &quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot;. A tea made from the flowers of &quot;Hibiscus sabdariffa&quot; is known by many names around the world and is served both hot and cold. The beverage is known for its red colour, tart flavour, and Vitamin C content.

== Etymology ==
The generic name is derived from the Greek name ἰβίσκος (&quot;ibískos&quot;) which Greek botanist Pedanius Dioscorides gave to a plant now scientifically labelled as &quot;Althaea officinalis&quot;.

== Description ==
The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, often with a toothed or lobed margin (dentate). The flowers are large and conspicuous. They are trumpet-shaped, with five or more petals, colour from white to pink, red, blue, orange, peach, yellow or purple, and from 4–18 cm broad.
Flower colour in certain species, such as &quot;H. mutabilis&quot; and &quot;H. tiliaceus&quot;, changes with age. The fruit is a dry five-lobed capsule, containing several seeds in each lobe, which are released when the capsule dehisces (splits open) at maturity. It is of red and white colours. It is an example of complete flowers.

== Species ==
The yellow hibiscus is the state flower of Hawaii, although the most commonly seen hibiscus in the state is &quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot;.
In temperate zones, probably the most commonly grown ornamental species is &quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot;, the common garden hibiscus, also known in some areas as the &quot;rose of Althea&quot; or &quot;rose of Sharon&quot; (but not to be confused with the unrelated &quot;Hypericum calycinum&quot;, also called &quot;rose of Sharon&quot;). In tropical and subtropical areas, the Chinese hibiscus (&quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot;), with its many showy hybrids, is the most popular hibiscus.

== Uses ==
=== Landscaping ===
Many species are grown for their showy flowers or used as landscape shrubs, and are used to attract butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds.

Hibiscus is a very hardy, versatile plant and in tropical conditions it can enhance the beauty of any garden. Being versatile it adapts itself easily to balcony gardens in crammed urban spaces and can be easily grown in pots as a creeper or even in hanging pots. It is a perennial and flowers throughout the year. As it comes in a variety of colors, it&#x27;s a plant which can add vibrancy to any garden.

The only infestation that gardeners need to be vigilant about is mealybugs. Mealybug infestations are easy to spot as they are clearly visible as a distinct white cottony infestation on buds, leaves or even stems.

=== Paper ===
One species of &quot;Hibiscus&quot;, known as kenaf (&quot;Hibiscus cannabinus&quot;), is extensively used in paper-making.

===Rope and construction===
The inner bark of the sea hibiscus (&quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;), also called &#x27;hau&#x27;, is used in Polynesia for making rope, and the wood for making canoe floats. The ropes on the missionary ship &quot;Messenger of Peace&quot; were made of fibres from hibiscus trees.

=== Beverage ===
The tea made of the calyces of &quot;Hibiscus sabdariffa&quot; is known by many names in many countries around the world and is served both hot and cold. The beverage is well known for its red colour, tartness and unique flavour. Additionally, it is highly nutritious because of its vitamin C content.

It is known as &quot;bissap&quot; in West Africa, &quot;Gul e Khatmi&quot; in Urdu &amp; Persian, &quot;agua de jamaica&quot; in Mexico and Central America (the flower being&quot; flor de jamaica&quot;) and &quot;Orhul&quot; in India. Some refer to it as &quot;roselle&quot;, a common name for the hibiscus flower. In Jamaica, Trinidad and many other islands in the Caribbean, the drink is known as &quot;sorrel&quot; (&quot;Hibiscus sabdariffa&quot;; not to be confused with &quot;Rumex acetosa&quot;, a species sharing the common name &quot;sorrel&quot;). In Ghana, the drink is known as &quot;soobolo&quot; in one of the local languages.

In Cambodia, a cold beverage can be prepared by first steeping the petals in hot water until the colors are leached from the petals, then adding lime juice (which turns the beverage from dark brown/red to a bright red), sweeteners (sugar/honey) and finally cold water/ice cubes.

In Egypt and Sudan, hibiscus tea is known as &quot;karkadé&quot; (كركديه), and is served as both a hot and a cold drink.

Hibiscus (also known in Sri Lanka as shoe flower, සපත්තු මල, වද මල in Sinhalese) is an ingredient with a rich heritage of refreshing Lankans. Fresh juices, ice teas and syrups made of the Hibiscus flower are famous refreshments among Sri Lankans.

=== Food ===
Dried hibiscus is edible, and it is often a delicacy in Mexico. It can also be candied and used as a garnish, usually for desserts. Contrary to popular assumptions that the flowers or petals are what is being eaten, it is the calyces.

The roselle (&quot;Hibiscus sabdariffa&quot;) is used as a vegetable. The species &quot;Hibiscus suratensis&quot; Linn synonymous with &quot;Hibiscus aculeatus&quot; G. Don is noted in Visayas in the Philippines as being a souring ingredient for almost all local vegetables and menus. Known as labog in the Visayan area (or labuag/sapinit in Tagalog), the species is an ingredient in cooking native chicken soup.

&quot;Hibiscus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidopteran species, including &quot;Chionodes hibiscella&quot;, &quot;Hypercompe hambletoni&quot;, the nutmeg moth, and the turnip moth.

=== Folk medicine ===
&quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is described as having a number of medical uses in Indian Ayurveda.

=== Claimed effects on blood pressure ===
It has been claimed that sour teas derived from &quot;Hibiscus sabdariffa&quot; may lower blood pressure.

=== Precautions and contraindications ===

==== Pregnancy and lactation ====
While the mechanism is not well understood, previous animal studies have demonstrated both an inhibitory effect of &quot;H. sabdariffa&quot; on muscle tone and the anti-fertility effects of &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot;, respectively. The extract of &quot;H. sabdariffa&quot; has been shown to stimulate contraction of the rat bladder and uterus; the &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; extract has exhibited contraceptive effects in the form of estrogen activity in rats. These findings have not been observed in humans. The &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is also thought to have emmenagogue effects which can stimulate menstruation and, in some women, cause an abortion. Due to the documented adverse effects in animal studies and the reported pharmacological properties, the &quot;H. sabdariffa&quot; and &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; are not recommended for use during pregnancy.

==== Drug interactions ====
It is postulated that &quot;H. sabdariffa&quot; interacts with diclofenac, chloroquine and acetaminophen by altering the pharmacokinetics. In healthy human volunteers, the &quot;H. sabdariffa&quot; extract was found to reduce the excretion of diclofenac upon co-administration. Additionally, co-administration of Karkade (&quot;H. sabdariffa&quot;), a common Sudanese beverage, was found to reduce chloroquine bioavailability. However, no statistically significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen when administered with the Zobo (&quot;H. sabdariffa&quot;) drink. Further studies are needed to demonstrate clinical significance.

== Symbolism and culture ==
The red hibiscus is the flower of the Hindu goddess Kali, and appears frequently in depictions of her in the art of Bengal, India, often with the goddess and the flower merging in form. The hibiscus is used as an offering to Kali and the god Ganesha in Hindu worship.

In the Philippines, the &quot;gumamela&quot; (the local name for hibiscus) is used by children as part of a bubble-making pastime. The flowers and leaves are crushed until the sticky juices come out. Hollow papaya stalks are then dipped into this and used as straws for blowing bubbles. Together with soap, hibiscus juices produce more bubbles. It is also called &quot;Tarukanga&quot; in Waray, particularly in Eastern Samar province.

The hibiscus flower is traditionally worn by Pacific island women, and is a known shared custom that if the flower is worn behind the left ear, the woman is married or has a boyfriend. If the flower is worn on the right, she is single or openly available for a relationship. The pink hibiscus flower has its origins in Asia and the Pacific Islands, where it has served as a symbol of beauty, femininity, and young love. It is commonly associated with the Hawaiian culture and the Aloha spirit, which celebrates love, happiness, and peace. 

A stylized image of the hibiscus flower was used as a logo of Air Polynésie.

Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie named her first novel &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; after the delicate flower.

The bark of the hibiscus contains strong bast fibres that can be obtained by letting the stripped bark set in the sea to let the organic material rot away.

A coastal area in Auckland, New Zealand is known as the Hibiscus Coast, named after the non-native flower due to its associations with beach and holiday atmospheres.

=== As a national and state symbol ===
The hibiscus is a national symbol of Haiti, and the national flower of nations including the Solomon Islands and Niue. &quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot; is the national flower of South Korea, and &quot;Hibiscus&quot; × &quot;rosa-sinensis&quot; is the national flower of Malaysia. &quot;Hibiscus brackenridgei&quot; is the state flower of Hawaii.

<text>Tamarind (Tamarindus indica) is a leguminous tree bearing edible fruit that is indigenous to tropical Africa and naturalized in Asia. The genus &quot;Tamarindus&quot; is monotypic, meaning that it contains only this species. It belongs to the family Fabaceae.

The tamarind tree produces brown, pod-like fruits that contain a sweet, tangy pulp, which is used in cuisines around the world. The pulp is also used in traditional medicine and as a metal polish. The tree&#x27;s wood can be used for woodworking and tamarind seed oil can be extracted from the seeds. Tamarind&#x27;s tender young leaves are used in South Indian and Filipino cuisine. Because tamarind has multiple uses, it is cultivated around the world in tropical and subtropical zones.

== Description ==

The tamarind is a long-living, medium-growth tree, which attains a maximum crown height of . The crown has an irregular, vase-shaped outline of dense foliage. The tree grows well in full sun. It prefers clay, loam, sandy, and acidic soil types, with a high resistance to drought and aerosol salt (wind-borne salt as found in coastal areas).

The evergreen leaves are alternately arranged and paripinnately compound. The leaflets are bright green, elliptic-ovular, pinnately veined, and less than in length. The branches droop from a single, central trunk as the tree matures, and are often pruned in agriculture to optimize tree density and ease of fruit harvest. At night, the leaflets close up.

As a tropical species, it is frost-sensitive. The pinnate leaves with opposite leaflets give a billowing effect in the wind. Tamarind timber consists of hard, dark red heartwood and softer, yellowish sapwood.

The tamarind flowers bloom (although inconspicuously), with red and yellow elongated flowers. Flowers are 2.5 cm (1 in) wide, five-petalled, borne in small racemes, and yellow with orange or red streaks. Buds are pink as the four sepals are pink and are lost when the flower blooms.

=== Fruit ===

The fruit is an indehiscent legume, sometimes called a pod, in length, with a hard, brown shell.

The fruit has a fleshy, juicy, acidic pulp. It is mature when the flesh is coloured brown or reddish brown. The tamarinds of Asia have longer pods (containing six to 12 seeds), whereas African and West Indian varieties have shorter pods (containing one to six seeds). The seeds are somewhat flattened, and a glossy brown. The fruit is sweet and sour in taste.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===

The name derives from , romanized &quot;tamr hindi&quot;, &quot;Indian date&quot;. Several early medieval herbalists and physicians wrote &quot;tamar indi&quot;, medieval Latin use was &quot;tamarindus&quot;, and Marco Polo wrote of &quot;tamarandi&quot;.

In Colombia, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Italy, Spain, and throughout the Lusosphere, it is called &quot;tamarindo&quot;. In those countries it is often used to make the beverage of the same name (or &quot;agua de tamarindo&quot;). In the Caribbean, tamarind is sometimes called &quot;tamón&quot;.

Countries in Southeast Asia like Indonesia call it &quot;asam jawa&quot; (Javanese sour fruit) or simply &quot;asam&quot;, and &quot;sukaer&quot; in Timor. While in the Philippines, it is called &quot;sampalok&quot; or &quot;sampaloc&quot; in Filipino, and &quot;sambag&quot; in Cebuano. Tamarind (&quot;Tamarindus indica&quot;) is sometimes confused with &quot;Manila tamarind&quot; (&quot;Pithecellobium dulce&quot;). While in the same taxonomic family Fabaceae, Manila tamarind is a different plant native to Mexico and known locally as &quot;guamúchili&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Tamarindus indica&quot; is probably indigenous to tropical Africa, but has been cultivated for so long on the Indian subcontinent that it is sometimes reported to be indigenous there. It grows wild in Africa in locales as diverse as Sudan, Cameroon, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Somalia, Tanzania and Malawi. In Arabia, it is found growing wild in Oman, especially Dhofar, where it grows on the sea-facing slopes of mountains. It reached South Asia likely through human transportation and cultivation several thousand years ago. It is widely distributed throughout the tropics, from Africa to South Asia.

In the 16th century, it was introduced to Mexico and Central America, and to a lesser degree to South America, by Spanish and Portuguese colonists, to the degree that it became a staple ingredient in the region&#x27;s cuisine.

 India is the largest producer of tamarind. The consumption of tamarind is widespread due to its central role in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Americas, especially Mexico.

== Uses ==

===Nutrition===
Raw tamarind is 63% carbohydrates, 31% water, 3% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw tamarind supplies 240 calories of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of thiamine (36% DV) and dietary minerals, including magnesium and potassium at 22% and 21% DV, respectively (table).

=== Culinary ===
The fruit is harvested by pulling the pod from its stalk. A mature tree can produce up to of fruit per year. Veneer grafting, shield (T or inverted T) budding, and air layering may be used to propagate desirable cultivars. Such trees will usually fruit within three to four years if provided optimum growing conditions.

The fruit pulp is edible. The hard green pulp of a young fruit is considered by many to be too sour, but is often used as a component of savory dishes, as a pickling agent or as a means of making certain poisonous yams in Ghana safe for human consumption. As the fruit matures it becomes sweeter and less sour (acidic) and the ripened fruit is considered more palatable. The sourness varies between cultivars and some sweet tamarind ones have almost no acidity when ripe. In Western cuisine, tamarind pulp is found in Worcestershire sauce, HP Sauce, and some brands of barbecue sauce (especially in Australia, with the tamarind derived from Worcestershire sauce).

Tamarind paste has many culinary uses including as a flavoring for chutneys, curries, and the traditional sharbat syrup drink. Tamarind sweet chutney is popular in India and Pakistan as a dressing for many snacks and often served with samosa. Tamarind pulp is a key ingredient in flavoring curries and rice in south Indian cuisine, in the Chigali lollipop, in rasam, Koddel and in certain varieties of masala chai.

Across the Middle East, from the Levant to Iran, tamarind is used in savory dishes, notably meat-based stews, and often combined with dried fruits to achieve a sweet-sour tang.

In the Philippines, the whole fruit is used as one of the souring agents of the sour soup &quot;sinigang&quot; (which can also use other sour fruits), as well as another type of soup called &quot;sinampalukan&quot; (which also uses tamarind leaves). The fruit pulp are also cooked in sugar and/or salt to make &quot;champóy na sampalok&quot; (or simply &quot;sampalok candy&quot;), a traditional tamarind candy. Indonesia also has a similarly sour, tamarind-based soup dish called sayur asem. Tamarind pulp mixed with liquid is also used in beverage as tamarind juice. In Java, Indonesia, tamarind juice is known as &quot;es asem&quot; or &quot;gula asem&quot;, tamarind juice served with palm sugar and ice as a fresh sour and sweet beverage.

In Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, the pulp is diluted with water and sugared to make an agua fresca drink. It is widely used throughout all of Mexico for candy making, including tamarind mixed with chilli powder candy.

In Sokoto, Nigeria, tamarind pulp is used to fix the color in dyed leather products by neutralizing the alkali substances used in tanning.

The leaves and bark are also edible, and the seeds can be cooked to make safe for consumption. Blanched, tender tamarind leaves are used in a Burmese salad called &quot;magyi ywet thoke&quot; (; ), a salad from Upper Myanmar that features tender blanched tamarind leaves, garlic, onions, roasted peanuts, and pounded dried shrimp.

=== Seed oil and kernel powder ===
Tamarind seed oil is made from the kernel of tamarind seeds. The kernel is difficult to isolate from its thin but tough shell (or &quot;testa&quot;). It has a similar consistency to linseed oil, and can be used to make paint or varnish.

Tamarind kernel powder is used as sizing material for textile and jute processing, and in the manufacture of industrial gums and adhesives. It is de-oiled to stabilize its colour and odor on storage.

=== Folk medicine ===
Throughout Southeast Asia, the fruit of the tamarind is used as a poultice applied to the foreheads of people with fevers. The fruit exhibits laxative effects due to its high quantities of malic acid, tartaric acid, and potassium bitartrate. Its use for the relief of constipation has been documented throughout the world. Extract of steamed and sun-dried old tamarind pulp in Java (&quot;asem kawa&quot;) are used to treat skin problems like rashes and irritation; it can also be ingested after dilution as an abortifacient.

=== Woodworking ===
Tamarind wood is used to make furniture, boats (as per Rumphius) carvings, turned objects such as mortars and pestles, chopping blocks, and other small specialty wood items like krises. Tamarind heartwood is reddish brown, sometimes with a purplish hue. The heartwood in tamarind tends to be narrow and is usually only present in older and larger trees. The pale yellow sapwood is sharply demarcated from the heartwood. Heartwood is said to be durable to very durable in decay resistance, and is also resistant to insects. Its sapwood is not durable and is prone to attack by insects and fungi as well as spalting. Due to its density and interlocked grain, tamarind is considered difficult to work. Heartwood has a pronounced blunting effect on cutting edges. Tamarind turns, glues, and finishes well. The heartwood is able to take a high natural polish.

=== Metal polish ===
In homes and temples, especially in Buddhist Asian countries including Myanmar, the fruit pulp is used to polish brass shrine statues and lamps, and copper, brass, and bronze utensils. Tamarind contains tartaric acid, a weak acid that can remove tarnish. Lime, another acidic fruit, is used similarly.


=== Research ===

In dogs, the tartaric acid of tamarind causes acute kidney injury, which can often be fatal.

Lupeol, catechins, epicatechin, quercetin, and isorhamnetin are present in the leaf extract. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed that tamarind seeds contained catechin, procyanidin B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chloramphenicol, myricetin, morin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol.

== Cultivation ==

Seeds can be scarified or briefly boiled to enhance germination. They retain their germination capability for several months if kept dry.

The tamarind has long been naturalized in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, the Caribbean, and Pacific Islands. Thailand has the largest plantations of the ASEAN nations, followed by Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines. In parts of Southeast Asia, tamarind is called &quot;asam&quot;. It is cultivated all over India, especially in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. Extensive tamarind orchards in India produce annually.

In the United States, it is a large-scale crop introduced for commercial use (second in net production quantity only to India), mainly in southern states, notably south Florida, and as a shade tree, along roadsides, in dooryards and in parks.

A traditional food plant in Africa, tamarind has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare. In Madagascar, its fruit and leaves are a well-known favorite of the ring-tailed lemur, providing as much as 50 percent of their food resources during the year if available.

=== Horticulture ===

Throughout South Asia and the tropical world, tamarind trees are used as ornamental, garden, and cash crop plantings. Commonly used as a bonsai species in many Asian countries, it is also grown as an indoor bonsai in temperate parts of the world.

<text>In Pacific Film Laboratories v Commissioner of Tax, (Australia) Windeyer J defined copyright: &quot;It is not a right in an existing thing. It is a negative right, as it has been called, a power to prevent the making of a physical thing by copying.&quot;

== Case Details ==
The &quot;Pacific Film Laboratories v. Commissioner of Tax&quot; was regarding whether the reproduction of prints owned by a third party, for that third party was an act of sale which could incur sales tax. Pacific Film argued that as it had no property right in the prints, it was not selling anything to the customer which might be taxed. The High Court rejected this argument saying that when Pacific Film reproduced the customer&#x27;s negatives, under authorisation from the customer, the copyright was owned by the customer but the chattel produced in the process of reproduction was owned by Pacific Film. The sale of this 
chattel to the customer incurred the sales tax.

<text>Robert Bosch (23 September 1861 – 12 March 1942) was a German business magnate, engineer and inventor, founder of Bosch.

==Biography==

Bosch was born in Albeck, in the Swabian Highlands near Ulm. He was one of twelve children born to Servatius Bosch and Maria Margarita Dölle. Servatius ran a large progressive farm that included a brewery. Robert Bosch&#x27;s nephew was future Nobel laureate Carl Bosch. Robert Bosch attended the &#x27;Realanstalt&#x27; in Ulm until 1879, that included an apprenticeship as a &quot;precision-instrument maker.&quot; Amongst Bosch&#x27;s various employments after graduating was that as a journeyman at C. &amp; E. Fein. In 1881 he fulfilled his year of military service in Ulm, followed by employment with Schuckert &amp; Co. until 1883. In 1883-84, Bosch studied under Professor Wilhelm Dietrich at the Stuttgart Technical University.
On 24 May 1884, Bosch sailed for the United States, becoming an engineer under Thomas Edison and Sigmund Bergmann in New York. On 13 May 1885, Bosch sailed for London, where he found employment with Siemens Brothers. On 15 November 1886, he opened his own &quot;Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering&quot; in Stuttgart.

In 1887, Gottlieb Daimler asked Bosch if he could build a device similar to the low-voltage magneto device with firing points the Gasoline Engine Factory Deutz was using in their four-stroke engine. Deutz claimed no patents protected the device, so Bosch made four devices. The purpose of the device was to generate an electric spark to ignite the air–fuel mixture in the cylinder at maximum compression. Over the next few years Bosch built a few hundred for factories making gas engines.

In 1893, Frederick Richard Simms met with Bosch, with the goal of adapting the stationary engine magnetos Bosch was building could be adapted to motor vehicles. In particular, a Jules-Albert de Dion tricycle was the test case. Arnold Zähringer, and Gottlob Honold, modified the Bosch device so that it had increased power and a faster sequence of sparks necessary, from 250 rpm up to 1800 rpm. Young Rall also modified the electrode, swapping enamel for the asbestos insulator. The complete device was patented. In January 1898, the new magneto was demonstrated on the tricycle and orders soon followed from Gottlieb Daimler. In 1900, in addition to using the device on motor vehicles, the Bosch magneto ignition was used in the Daimler engines on the Zeppelin.
Simms introduced the Bosch ignition device to the English market as Simms-Bosch. In 1899, they entered the French market as the Automatic Magneto Electric Ignition Company, Ltd.

The first sales office and the first factory in the U.S. were opened in 1906 and 1910 respectively. By 1913, the company had branch operations in America, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and was generating 88% of its sales outside Germany. In rapid succession in the years following the First World War, Bosch launched innovations for the motor vehicle, including diesel fuel injection in 1927. In the 1920s the global economic crisis caused Bosch to begin a rigorous program of modernization and diversification in his company. In only a few years&#x27; time, he succeeded in turning his company from a small automotive supplier into a multinational electronics group.

From the beginning, Bosch was greatly concerned about promoting occupational training. Prompted by his awareness of social responsibility, he was one of the first industrialists in Germany to introduce the eight-hour work day, followed by other social benefits for his associates. Robert Bosch did not wish to profit from the armaments contracts awarded to his company during WWI. Instead, he donated several million German marks to charitable causes, including to the establishment of Stuttgart&#x27;s Robert Bosch Hospital in 1940.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Robert Bosch was politically active. As a liberal businessman, he sat on a number of economic committees. He devoted a great deal of energy and money to the cause of bringing about reconciliation between Germany and France. He hoped this reconciliation would bring about lasting peace in Europe and lead to the creation of a European economic area.

===Third Reich===

The Nazi regime in Germany brought Bosch&#x27;s peacemaking efforts to an abrupt end. The Bosch company accepted armaments contracts and employed an estimated 20,000 slaves (including some 1200 concentration camp inmates who were &quot;brutally abused at the Langenbielau plant&quot;) during the war. Meanwhile, Bosch secretly supported the resistance against Adolf Hitler, and together with his closest associates saved victims of Nazi persecution from deportation.

On his eightieth birthday, Bosch was awarded the title &quot;Pionier der Arbeit&quot; (Pioneer of Labor) by Hitler and when he died a year later, he was afforded a state funeral by the Third Reich.

Bosch was keenly interested in agricultural issues and owned a farm south of Munich. He was also a passionate hunter. When he died, he was survived by four children from two marriages. A son from his first marriage died in 1921 following a protracted illness.

In 1937, Bosch had restructured his company as a private limited company (close corporation). He had established his last will and testament in which he stipulated that the earnings of the company should be allocated to charitable causes. Also, his will sketched the outlines of the corporate constitution, which was formulated by his successors in 1964 and is still valid today.

He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1984.

The club formally came into existence in 1946 when the First Trinity Boat Club and the Third Trinity Boat Club merged, although the two clubs had been rowing together for several years before that date. The first boat club associated with Trinity was formed in 1825 and came to be known as First Trinity in 1833 when the Third Trinity Boat Club was formed (a Second Trinity Boat Club was formed in 1831 but did not have a continuous existence until 1840). Membership of Third Trinity was originally confined to Old Etonians and Old Westminsters. Members of Third Trinity were allowed also to be members of First or Second Trinity and often were.

The boat club also gives its name to Trinity College&#x27;s May Ball, which is the oldest such event in Cambridge and originates from the club&#x27;s celebrations after the victories in the May Bumps.

== History and legend==

In the nineteenth century the various Trinity boat clubs were very strong, often won events in Cambridge and at various regattas around the country, notably the Henley Royal Regatta, and regularly contributed rowers to the Cambridge boat for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. In the 1849 Boat Race, all members of the crew were from Trinity, seven from Third Trinity and two, the cox included, from First Trinity. Boats from the three clubs could often be found at, or near, the top of the Bumps race and they sometimes combined their resources in races against the rest of the University.

In 1876 Second Trinity was disbanded due to having insufficient members. A legend claims that during the Bumps in that year, the rowers of Trinity&#x27;s arch-rivals, St John&#x27;s College, attached a sword to the bow of one of their boats, so that if they successfully bumped the boat in front (which turned out to be one of Second Trinity&#x27;s), it would be holed and sink. The plan supposedly worked in that the Trinity boat did sink, but in the process the sword also hit and killed Second Trinity&#x27;s cox, which of course was not intended. The legend claims that this is the reason why Second Trinity Boat Club was dissolved, and why St John&#x27;s College is no longer allowed a boat club under its own name. There is no traced record of a crew from St John&#x27;s attaching a sword to their bow and, while a St John&#x27;s College Boat Club was disbanded in 1876, the original boat club at St John&#x27;s was Lady Margaret Boat Club. A somewhat similar incident occurred in the 1888 Lent Bumps, 12 years after the dissolution of Second Trinity, after which bow balls became mandatory. In his &quot;History of the First Trinity Boat Club&quot;, Walter Rouse Ball observes: &quot;The third day was the occasion of a sad tragedy. Clare bumped Queens&#x27;, and drew into the bank by Grassy. Behind these boats was the Trinity Hall third boat. This, instead of rounding First Post Corner, ran, by some mishap, across the river, and the nose of the boat struck number 4 in the Clare boat just over his heart, killing him on the spot. The further races were at once stopped. Since this dreadful incident small india-rubber knobs have been fixed on the bows of all the racing boats&quot;. The more prosaic explanation for 2nd Trinity&#x27;s demise is that membership was restricted to Theology scholars, who over time proved to be an unreliable source of oarsmen.

In the twentieth century the clubs remained competitive and continued to achieve success in various events. The Second World War forced the two clubs to combine resources, and after the war they formally merged in order to remain competitive with the now larger boat clubs of other colleges. In the same year First and Third won the Visitors&#x27; Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, and the following year they won the Ladies&#x27; Challenge Plate. They won the Ladies Plate again in 1954 and in 1967, which was the last year that a college crew from either Cambridge or Oxford has won the event. The difference in the standard of rowing between Oxbridge colleges and non-University clubs changed greatly over the twentieth century, possibly due to standards at college clubs falling or to the quality of rowing in other clubs improving, but probably a combination of the two. For example, First and Third, like all other Oxbridge college crews, now have difficulty achieving a standard of rowing to qualify for events at the Henley Royal Regatta, let alone to win these events. In spite of this, rowing within Cambridge remains popular and the Bumps, the main inter-college event, see well over 1000 students competing, typically around 100 from Trinity.

===First Trinity Boat Club===

The Trinity Boat Club, the original rowing club of Trinity College, Cambridge, dates from 1825 and was usually called &quot;First Trinity Boat Club&quot; after 1833. It was open to all members of the College.

In 1946, the club amalgamated with the other remaining boat club of the College, Third Trinity Boat Club, to form First and Third Trinity Boat Club, and in this form continues to compete today.

The club was very successful throughout its history, but especially in the 19th century. Its early history is well covered by Walter Rouse Ball&#x27;s 1908 book, &quot;A History of The First Trinity Boat Club&quot;, which is available online in its entirety.

In 1839 First Trinity won the Grand Challenge Cup in the first Henley Royal Regatta (but not made &quot;Royal&quot; till 1851). The crew rowed in a boat named the Black Prince, the bow section of which is still owned by the First and Third Trinity Boat Club but which is on loan to the River and Rowing Museum in Henley. They defeated the other three entries, who were Wadham College, Oxford, Brasenose College, Oxford and the Oxford Etonian Club. First and Third Trinity Boat Club still names its higher quality men&#x27;s eight-oared boats &#x27;Black Prince&#x27;. As new boats are purchased, older boats are demoted to lower boat use and are referred to by their boat registration eg Black Prince 804, Black Prince 803.

1st Trinity has won Olympic gold on two occasions. The coxless four of Charles Eley, James MacNabb, Robert Morrison and Terence Sanders won gold for Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, with Canada gaining silver, and Switzerland the bronze. In the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, 1st Trinity successfully defended the coxless fours title (Richard Beesly, Edward Bevan, John Lander, Michael Warriner), with the United States getting silver and Italy receiving bronze.

First Trinity was also very successful on its home water, the River Cam. Between 1827 and 1908 First Trinity was &quot;Head&quot; crew in the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Bumps races 38 times, more than any other Club.

===Second Trinity Boat Club===

The Second Trinity Boat Club was a short-lived rowing club at Trinity College. Little is known about the club, as very few records survive from 2nd Trinity. The club was reserved for members of the clergy and theology students who were studying at Trinity, and, by 1876 the club folded due to a lack of members.

2nd Trinity competed in the early bumps races in Cambridge from 1829 until its demise in 1876, going Head of the River in 1835 and 1849.

The club was originally known as the &quot;Nautilus Club&quot;, changing its name to &quot;Second Trinity, Queen Bess&quot; to reflect the name of its boat, a common practice at the time. The name of the club continued as Queen Bess until 1838, when it ceased competing. The club reformed in 1840 as the &quot;2nd Trinity Boat Club&quot;, but was often described as &quot;Reading Trinity&quot; and nicknamed the &quot;Hallelujahs&quot;, in reflection of its membership. By the mid-1860s, the club was in decline, and despite efforts by the First Trinity Boat Club in 1866 to limit their membership in order to boost that of 2nd Trinity, this failed to help, and the decline continued. 1st Trinity voted to remove their membership limit once again. By 1870, the club had abandoned its original entry requirements, and allowed new students who did not have a connection to theology courses, and this allowed the club to continue for a few years, even rising back up to 7th in the bumps races in 1873. Thereafter, numbers dwindled once again, and by the Easter term 1876, the club had dropped to last but one in the first division. At a meeting of all three Trinity clubs, the 2nd Trinity Boat Club was formally dissolved, with its members given an invitation to join First Trinity.

In 1894, a group of students had claimed to have re-founded 2nd Trinity, and raced in the bumps, but the new 2nd Trinity was not recognised by the Cambridge University Boat Club and did not race again.

One of 2nd Trinity&#x27;s trophies, the &quot;Baines Cup&quot;, is used today as the main prize of the &quot;Second Trinity Challenge Sculls&quot;, a sculling race run by the current 1st and 3rd Trinity members.

An account of its history can be found at First and Third Trinity Boat Club.

===Third Trinity Boat Club===

The Third Trinity Boat Club was a rowing club which was only open to certain members of Trinity College, Cambridge. Members of Third Trinity had to have been to school at either Eton College or Westminster School. Due to a lack of members around the time of World War II, Third Trinity combined with the First Trinity Boat Club, to make up the current First and Third Trinity Boat Club which survives to this day.

Third Trinity rowed with black blades.

====Results====
Third Trinity competed in the early bumps races at Cambridge University and also in the Lent and May Bumps when they became separate events in 1887.

Third Trinity nearly always did better in the May Bumps than the Lent Bumps, achieving the headship of the May Bumps on nine occasions including holding it for six consecutive years between 1901 and 1906. When the club began rowing with First Trinity, the 1st VIII were in 9th position.

Third Trinity never went head of the Lent Bumps, but managed second place in 1902 and 1922 before plummeting into the mid 2nd division just before the merger.

Third Trinity still hold the record for the most wins in the &quot;Visitors&#x27; Challenge Cup&quot; at the Henley Royal Regatta, standing at 14, even though they have not entered since the merger over 70 years ago.

===Merger with First Trinity===
Third Trinity merged with First Trinity officially in 1946, but the two clubs had been rowing together in the bumps throughout the war period.

In 1946, the newly formed First and Third Trinity Boat Club entered the Henley Royal Regatta and won the &quot;Visitors&#x27; Challenge Cup&quot; with ease; they won the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Challenge Plate&quot; the following year.

Following the merger, the new club took the bumps positions of First Trinity&#x27;s crews, since they were placed higher than those of Third Trinity, but the new club used Third Trinity&#x27;s black blades for a number of years, before switching to the current blade colours of blue and gold.

<text>Motorized infantry is infantry that is transported by trucks or other motor vehicles. It is distinguished from mechanized infantry, which is carried in armoured personnel carriers or infantry fighting vehicles, and from light infantry, which can typically operate independently from supporting elements and vehicles for relatively long periods and may be airborne.

== Operations ==
As defined by the United States Army, motorization is &quot;the use of unarmored wheeled vehicles for the transportation of combat units.&quot; Motorizing infantry is the first stage towards the mechanization of an army. Civilian trucks are often readily adaptable to military uses of transporting soldiers, towing guns, and carrying equipment and supplies. Motorization greatly increases the strategic mobility of infantry units, which would otherwise rely on marches or railroads. In practice, armies have found it advantageous to develop trucks to military specifications, such as all-wheel drive, to have vehicles that function reliably in extremes of weather and terrain.

Motorization provides no direct tactical advantage in small-unit combat, as trucks and light utility vehicles are vulnerable to artillery and small arms fire. However, in larger battles, motorized infantry has an advantage in mobility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, and the ability to outmaneuver the enemy.

The disadvantage of motorization is that fuel is critical; if motorized divisions run out of fuel, they may be required to abandon their vehicles.

== History ==
The First World War was the first major war to see use of petroleum-powered vehicles used to transport supplies and personnel, and to fight the enemy. Unarmored and armored cars were dispatched to attack enemy positions and trains, and were used to patrol the front. However, this was on a small scale and a majority of movement was on foot and logistics with trains and horse-drawn logistics.

The Pancho Villa Expedition was a notable use of the armored car by the United States Cavalry under the command of General Pershing. There a Lieutenant George S. Patton was introduced to mechanized warfare when he led a small group of men against Villa&#x27;s forces at San Miguelito Ranch.

After the war, the major militaries of the world saw the great benefit that motorized vehicles could have on the logistics and combat effectiveness of their infantry units.

In the 1920s, the British created the Experimental Mechanized Force between the wars to test the capabilities of all-arms formations of mechanized units, this included motorized infantry (&quot;Motor Battalions&quot;).

The speed advantages of motorized infantry first became important in World War II in the German Blitzkrieg. While it was no more robust than the regular infantry that moved on foot, its increased speed became decisive in the Blitzkrieg strategy, as it could follow the panzer forces and defend its flanks.

Notwithstanding the obvious advantages of motorization, most countries opted for only partial motorization of their infantry because of the cost and logistical implications caused by the deployment of so many vehicles. Even large armies were affected by such factors. The motorization of armies required massive industrialization of the economies in order to meet the heavy cost for vehicle production, replacement parts, and fueling.

The bulk of German and Soviet infantry remained on foot. While some units of the Wehrmacht, such as its armored divisions, were highly mechanized, most of the army was still using horses due to its inconsistent oil supply.

US infantry divisions were able to motorize a major portion of their infantry due to their industrial base. Likewise, infantry divisions of the British Empire could motorize chosen subordinate units, but infantry usually advanced on foot.

After WW2, most armies completely motorized and partially mechanized their infantry. The engineering improvements throughout the 20th century allowed for increasingly bigger vehicles to be deployed.

In Russia and the former Soviet Union, the term &quot;motostrelki&quot; (мотострелки in Cyrillic) is used to indicate mechanized infantry; that term was used in some Warsaw Pact countries. These &quot;motor rifle&quot; divisions were mostly mechanized but had a core of motorized infantry with them. In practice, this meant that the infantry of the Soviet and Russian &quot;tank&quot; divisions rode in fully tracked BMP vehicles, while those in &quot;motor rifle&quot; divisions were equipped with wheeled BTR vehicles.

== Present day ==

After the Vietnam War, the US military saw the need for light squad based transportation. This project became the Humvee which was used extensively by the Army and Marine Corps in the Gulf War, Early War in Afghanistan, and Early Iraq War. The latter two conflicts resulted in a large scale insurgency and saw the increase in use of IEDs. This soon became the largest source of casualties to NATO forces. The result was a shift away from lightly armored vehicles to more mechanized vehicles or more heavily armored MRAPs. During the duration of the Humvee&#x27;s use in Iraq and Afghanistan and before the roll-out of MRAPs, it slowly became more heavily armored with larger turret shields, bulletproof glass and extra plating on its doors and components. Less armored but faster and lighter MRAPs were developed under the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program, which is now phase in the Oshkosh L-ATV and M-ATV. It has been described as &quot;the first vehicle purpose-built for modern battlefield-networks&quot;. These vehicles have seen deployments in Rojava, Syria in Operation Inherent Resolve.

For transportation outside of combat, the US military fields a variety of trucks including the Medium Tactical Vehicles replacement for the Marine Corps and the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles for the Army. The National Guard and other reserve units also field older models such as the M939 5-ton 6x6.

<doc id="227947" wikidata="Q6094075" url="?curid=227947" title="Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v. Russian Kurier, Inc.">
<text>Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v. Russian Kurier, Inc., 153 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 1998), was a copyright case about the Russian language weekly &quot;Russian Kurier&quot; in New York City that had copied and published various materials from Russian newspapers and news agency reports of Itar-TASS. The case was ultimately decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The decision was widely commented upon and the case is considered a landmark case because the court defined rules applicable in the U.S. on the extent to which the copyright laws of the country of origin or those of the U.S. apply in international disputes over copyright. The court held that to determine whether a claimant actually held the copyright on a work, the laws of the country of origin usually applied (more precisely: &quot;copyright is a form of property&quot; and under the Second Restatement&#x27;s approach, the governing law is &quot;determined by the law of the state with &#x27;the most significant relationship&#x27; to the property and to the parties&quot;), but that to decide whether a copyright infringement had occurred and for possible remedies, the laws of the country where the infringement was claimed applied (&quot;lex loci delicti&quot;).

== Case history ==
Itar-TASS, several Russian newspapers, and the Union of Journalists of Russia sued &quot;Russian Kurier&quot;, its owner, and its printing company for copyright infringement in 1995 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The court issued a preliminary injunction against the defendant. This preliminary injunction applied to all copied articles for which the plaintiffs had registered copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office or that were published after March 13, 1995, the date Russia signed the Berne Convention. The U.S. at that time still required explicit copyright registrations for copyrights to be recognized as valid. Of the more than 500 articles &quot;Russian Kurier&quot; had copied from 1992 to 1995, the court considered 317 copyrighted in the U.S. as &quot;Berne Works&quot; (i.e., works originally published in another member country of the Berne Convention, of which the U.S. had been a member since 1989), and a further 28 first published in Russia before March 13, 1995 were copyrighted in the U.S. because they were indeed registered at the U.S. Copyright Office, accounting for a total of 345 copyright violations.

In its ruling two years later (No. 95 Civ. 2144(JGK) (S.D.N.Y. March 10, 1997); also known as &quot;Itar-TASS II&quot;), the court found &quot;Russian Kurier&quot; and its owner had willfully committed multiple copyright violations. The court upheld the injunction and fined the defendants US$ 500,000 in favor of the plaintiffs. The printing company was fined US$3,934 as by printing the newspaper, the court considered it had contributed to the commitment of these copyright violations, although without intent. The court defined that the plaintiffs&#x27; rights were to be determined by Russian law, but the infringement had to be judged by U.S. law; and came to the conclusion that under Russian copyright law, the news agency Itar-TASS and the individual authors of the newspaper articles certainly were copyright holders and thus entitled to sue. However, the district court denied the journalists&#x27; association any right to relief as it was unclear exactly which of its members were authors of the copied articles, or whether all such authors were indeed members. There was some dispute over the copyright claims by the newspapers, as the defendants&#x27; experts argued that these only held a copyright on their publication &quot;as a whole&quot; but not on individual articles, but the district judge agreed with the plaintiffs&#x27; expert who interpreted the relevant paragraphs of the Russian law as giving rise to &quot;parallel exclusive rights in both the newspaper publisher and the reporter&quot;, similar to co-authorship.

The defendants appealed against that court&#x27;s ruling. The case came before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (153 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 1998)), which partly confirmed and partly reversed the district court&#x27;s ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings.

The court of appeals affirmed the choice of applicable law made by the lower court. It agreed that Russian law was to be used to determine who was the copyright holder of the work and that U.S. law was to be applied to figure out whether a copyright violation had occurred and to judge it. However, it overturned the decision of the district court regarding the newspapers. The court of appeals, after extensive analysis, found the view of the defendants&#x27; experts on the matter &quot;more compelling&quot;. It stated that newspapers had no copyright on individual articles in their publications but only a compilation copyright on the publication as a whole. The copyright on the text of the individual articles was found to vest in the individual authors of these articles unless there had been a contractual assignment of copyrights from the reporters to their employers (the newspapers). Since the newspapers did not provide any evidence of such copyright assignments, the appellate court ruled in this case that they did not hold the copyright on the text of the individual copied articles. Finally, the court explicitly decided
*that Itar-TASS, as a news agency (not a newspaper), &quot;was&quot; a copyright holder and was entitled to injunctive relief and damages,
*that the Union of Journalists of Russia &quot;might be&quot; entitled to relief as it was considered acting on behalf of its members, amongst them the individual authors of the copied articles, and
*that the newspapers, albeit not entitled to relief due to copying of the article text as they did not hold the copyright, &quot;might still be&quot; entitled to relief due to the wholesale cut-and-paste copying done by &quot;Russian Kurier&quot;, which might have infringed the newspapers&#x27; rights arising from the creative efforts in the selection, arrangement, or display of the articles.
Because of the two last points, the case was remanded to the district court. The appellate court &quot;in view of the reckless conduct of the defendants in the flagrant copying that infringed the rights of Itar-Tass, the rights of the authors, and very likely some aspects of the limited protectable rights of the newspapers&quot; left the injunction in force until the district court would, on remand, issue a new ruling.

== Consequences ==
The ruling concerning the choice of law (&quot;lex originis&quot; for determining copyright ownership and &quot;lex loci delicti&quot; for the infringement) was contrary to the previous presumption that only the law where the infringement occurred (i.e., &quot;lex loci delicti&quot;) would apply. It has been discussed controversially in several publications. Since the Berne Convention does not offer any guidance on which law shall be applied to determine copyright ownership, this ruling is still the relevant case law in this question and the principle is applied in the U.S. even in other recent cases. The decision is only effective within the U.S.; other countries may follow other rules, such as using the &quot;lex loci delicti&quot; exclusively.

The copyright in the U.S. on foreign publications that had failed to comply with the (former) formality requirements of the U.S. was generally restored when the copyright restorations of the Uruguay Round Agreement Act (URAA) became effective in the U.S. on January 1, 1996. The URAA was a result of the TRIPS agreement, part of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. The URAA automatically restored the copyright on foreign works that were still copyrighted in their country of origin on January 1, 1996, but whose copyright in the U.S. had lapsed through non-compliance with the U.S. formalities, such as non-registration or a lack of international or bilateral copyright treaties between the country of origin of a work and the U.S. Later copyright cases in the U.S. do apply the URAA restorations and thus even may consider unregistered foreign works as copyrighted in the U.S.

== Related cases ==
The &quot;lex loci delicti&quot; is not always the US law, even for cases heard in the US. In &quot;London Film Productions, Ltd. v. Intercontinental Communications, Inc.&quot; (1984) a US corporation was sued by a British company for infringements under the laws of several Latin American countries; the US court determined that it had jurisdiction.

In &quot;Bridgeman Art Library, Ltd. v. Corel Corp.&quot; (1998) a US court decided that it must apply the stricter US threshold of originality (decided in &quot;Feist v. Rural&quot;) rather than the lower British standard invoked by the plaintiff.

A more complex case of determining ownership under Russian law in a US court was &quot;Films by Jove Inc. v. Berov&quot; because it involved two claimants to copyrights under the Russian laws to films by Soyuzmultfilm, themselves involved in litigation in Russia. A US judge basically overruled a decision by the High Court of Arbitration of Russia because, in his view, the Russian court&#x27;s decision was &quot;strongly influenced, if not coerced, by the efforts of various Russian government officials seeking to promote &#x27;state interests&#x27;&quot;, thus lacking procedural fairness.

In France, the Court of Cassation decided on 10 April 2013 that in case of conflicting laws, the French law prevails in all matters regarding copyright, including the determination of ownership. This ruling quashed the decision of a lower court, which had decided that in a lawsuit between a reporter-cameraman of a US media company operating in France, the US law applied in determining ownership of the footage.

<text>Trier-Saarburg (; ) is a district in the west of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north and clockwise) Bitburg-Prüm, Bernkastel-Wittlich, Birkenfeld, Sankt Wendel (Saarland), and Merzig-Wadern (Saarland). To the west it borders Luxembourg. The district-free city Trier is surrounded by the district.

==History==
The district was created in 1969 by merging the previous districts Trier and Saarburg.

==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Moselle. The area between its tributaries, the Ruwer and the Saar, is also well known as one of the prime wine regions of Germany.

==Museums==

* Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum, Konz
* Fell Exhibition Slate Mine
* Air museum, Hermeskeil
* Railway and steam engine museum, Hermeskeil

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms largely resembles the coat of arms of the Saarburg district. The castle in the middle shows the castle of Saarburg, even though now only the ruins of the castle remains. The red cross is the cross of Trier, as a large part of the Saarburg district (as well as of the new Trier-Saarburg district) historically belonged to the state of Trier. The blue bars were added after the merging with the Trier district, and symbolize that part of that district historically belonged to Luxembourg.

== Verbandsgemeinden ==
The district is divided into six Verbandsgemeinden. The list contains the coats of arms, the names, the district areas, exemplarily the population figures from 1950 as well as the current population figures:

== Towns and municipalities ==

Four towns and 100 municipalities make up the district in southwestern Germany. The list contains the coats of arms, the names, the district areas, exemplarily the population figures from 1950 as well as the current population figures:

<doc id="227956" wikidata="Q155935" url="?curid=227956" title="Columbus (ISS module)">
<text>Columbus is a science laboratory that is part of the International Space Station (ISS) and is the largest single contribution to the ISS made by the European Space Agency (ESA).

Like the &quot;Harmony&quot; and &quot;Tranquility&quot; modules, the &quot;Columbus&quot; laboratory was constructed in Turin, Italy by Thales Alenia Space. The functional equipment and software of the lab was designed by EADS in Bremen, Germany. It was also integrated in Bremen before being flown to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida in an Airbus Beluga. It was launched aboard on 7 February 2008, on flight STS-122. It is designed for ten years of operation. The module is controlled by the Columbus Control Centre, located at the German Space Operations Center, part of the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, Germany.

The European Space Agency has spent €1.4 billion (about US$2 billion) on building &quot;Columbus&quot;, including the experiments it carries and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them.

== History ==

The structure used for &quot;Columbus&quot; is based on the MPLM module built for NASA by Thales Alenia Space. In 2000 the pre-integrated module (structure including harness and tubing) was delivered to Bremen in Germany by the Co-prime contractor Alenia. The final integration and system testing was performed by the overall prime contractor EADS Astrium Space Transportation, after that the initial Payload was integrated and the overall complement checked-out.

On 27 May 2006 &quot;Columbus&quot; was flown from Bremen, Germany to Kennedy Space Center on board an Airbus Beluga.

The final schedule was much longer than originally planned due to development problems (several caused by the complex responsibility splitting between the Co-prime and the Overall prime contractor) and design changes introduced by ESA but being affordable due to the Shuttle problems delaying the &quot;Columbus&quot; launch for several years. The main design change was the addition of the &quot;External Payload Facility&quot; (EPF), which was driven by the different European Payload organizations being more interested in outer space than internal experiments. Also the addition of a terminal for direct communications to/from ground, which could have been used also as back-up for the ISS system, was studied but not implemented for cost reasons.

== Construction ==
ESA chose EADS Astrium Space Transportation as prime contractor for &quot;Columbus&quot; overall design, verification and integration. The &quot;Columbus&quot; structure, the micro-meteorite protection system, the active and passive thermal control, the environmental control, the harness and all the related ground support equipment were designed and qualified by Alcatel Alenia Space in Turin, Italy as defined by the PICA – Principle (for definition see History below); the related hardware was pre-integrated and sent as PICA in September 2001 to Bremen. The lab was built and qualified on system level at the EADS Astrium Space Transportation facilities in Bremen, Germany, from where it was sent to NASA.

== Launch, berthing and outfitting ==
In November 2007, &quot;Columbus&quot; was moved out of the KSC Space Station Processing Facility, and installed into the payload bay of the &quot;Atlantis&quot; orbiter for launch on ISS assembly flight 1E (STS-122).

=== STS-122 launch delays===
During cryo-filling of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen prior to the first launch attempt on 6 December 2007, two of four LH2 ECO sensors failed a test. Mission rules called for at least three of the four sensors to be in working order for a launch attempt to proceed. As a result of the failure, the Launch Director Doug Lyons postponed the launch, initially for 24 hours. This was later revised into a 72-hour delay, resulting in a next launch attempt set for Sunday 9 December 2007. This launch attempt was scrubbed when one of the ECO sensors again failed during fuelling.

The ECO sensors&#x27; external connector was changed on the Space Shuttle external tank, causing a two-month delay in the launch. &quot;Columbus&quot; was finally launched successfully on the third attempt at 2:45pm EST, 7 February 2008.

=== Berthing ===
Once at the station, Canadarm2 removed &quot;Columbus&quot; from the docked shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay and attached it to the starboard hatch of &quot;Harmony&quot; (also known as Node 2), with the cylinder pointing outwards on 11 February 2008.

== Description ==
The laboratory is a cylindrical module, made from stainless steel, kevlar and hardened aluminum, with two end cones. It is in external diameter and in overall length, excluding the projecting external experiment racks. Its shape is very similar to that of the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules (MPLMs),
since both were designed to fit in the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle orbiter. The starboard end cone contains most of the laboratory&#x27;s on-board computers. The port end cone contains the Common Berthing Mechanism.

=== Specifications ===

* Diameter: 
* Total mass: 
* Total payload mass 
* Total on-orbit mass 
* Construction details:
** Wall thickness 4mm

Activities in the lab are controlled on the ground by the Columbus Control Center (at DLR Oberpfaffenhofen in Germany) and by the associated User Support Operations Centres throughout Europe.

The laboratory can accommodate ten active International Standard Payload Racks (ISPRs) for science payloads.
Agreements with NASA allocate to ESA 51% usage of the &quot;Columbus&quot; Laboratory.
ESA is thus allocated five active rack locations, with the other five being allocated to NASA.
Four active rack locations are on the forward side of the deck, four on the aft side, and two are in overhead locations.
Three of the deck racks are filled with life support and cooling systems.
The remaining deck rack and the two remaining overhead racks are storage racks.

In addition, four un-pressurized payload platforms can be attached outside the starboard cone, on the &quot;Columbus&quot; External Payload Facility (CEPF). Each external payload is mounted on an adaptor able to accommodate small instruments and experiments totalling up to .

The following European ISPRs have been initially installed inside &quot;Columbus&quot;:
* Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL)
* European Physiology Modules (EPM)
* Biolab
* European Drawer Rack (EDR)
* European Stowage Rack

The first external payloads were mounted on &quot;Columbus&quot; by crew members of the mission STS-122 mission. The three payloads mounted are:
* European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) platform, which accommodates nine instruments: TRIBOLAB, PLEGPAY, MEDET, EUFIDE, DEBIE-2, FIPEX, EUTEMP, EXPOSE, DOSTEL, and the Earth Viewing Camera.
* Solar Monitoring Observatory (SOLAR)
* MISSE-6 (NASA payload)

Planned additional external payloads:
* Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES)
* EXPORT
* Atmosphere-Space Interaction Monitor (ASIM)
* European Data Relay Satellite (EDRS) Communications Terminal, Ka-band

In 2014 the ISS-RapidScat instrument was installed, which was operated until late 2016. ISS-RapidScat was transported to ISS by the SpaceX CRS-4 spaceflight.

<text>XMM-Newton, also known as the High Throughput X-ray Spectroscopy Mission and the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission, is an X-ray space observatory launched by the European Space Agency in December 1999 on an Ariane 5 rocket. It is the second cornerstone mission of ESA&#x27;s Horizon 2000 programme. Named after physicist and astronomer Sir Isaac Newton, the spacecraft is tasked with investigating interstellar X-ray sources, performing narrow- and broad-range spectroscopy, and performing the first simultaneous imaging of objects in both X-ray and optical (visible and ultraviolet) wavelengths.

Initially funded for two years, with a ten-year design life, the spacecraft remains in good health and has received repeated mission extensions, most recently in March 2023 and is scheduled to operate until the end of 2026. ESA plans to succeed &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; with the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA), the second large mission in the Cosmic Vision 2015–2025 plan, to be launched in 2035. &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; is similar to NASA&#x27;s Chandra X-ray Observatory, also launched in 1999.

As of May 2018, close to 5,600 papers have been published about either &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; or the scientific results it has returned.

== Concept and mission history ==
The observational scope of &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; includes the detection of X-ray emissions from astronomical objects, detailed studies of star-forming regions, investigation of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters, the environment of supermassive black holes and mapping of the mysterious dark matter.

In 1982, even before the launch of &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; predecessor &quot;EXOSAT&quot; in 1983, a proposal was generated for a &quot;multi-mirror&quot; X-ray telescope mission. The &quot;XMM&quot; mission was formally proposed to the ESA Science Programme Committee in 1984 and gained approval from the Agency&#x27;s Council of Ministers in January 1985. That same year, several working groups were established to determine the feasibility of such a mission, and mission objectives were presented at a workshop in Denmark in June 1985. At this workshop, it was proposed that the spacecraft contain 12 low-energy and 7 high-energy X-ray telescopes. The spacecraft&#x27;s overall configuration was developed by February 1987, and drew heavily from lessons learned during the &quot;EXOSAT&quot; mission; the Telescope Working Group had reduced the number of X-ray telescopes to seven standardised units. In June 1988 the European Space Agency approved the mission and issued a call for investigation proposals (an &quot;announcement of opportunity&quot;). Improvements in technology further reduced the number of X-ray telescopes needed to just three.

In June 1989, the mission&#x27;s instruments had been selected and work began on spacecraft hardware. A project team was formed in January 1993 and based at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Netherlands. Prime contractor Dornier Satellitensysteme (a subsidiary of the former DaimlerChrysler Aerospace) was chosen in October 1994 after the mission was approved into the implementation phase, with development and construction beginning in March 1996 and March 1997, respectively. The XMM Survey Science Centre was established at the University of Leicester in 1995. The three flight mirror modules for the X-ray telescopes were delivered by Italian subcontractor Media Lario in December 1998, and spacecraft integration and testing was completed in September 1999.

&quot;XMM&quot; left the ESTEC integration facility on 9 September 1999, taken by road to Katwijk then by the barge &quot;Emeli&quot; to Rotterdam. On 12 September, the spacecraft left Rotterdam for French Guiana aboard Arianespace transport ship MN &quot;Toucan&quot;. The &quot;Toucan&quot; docked at the French Guianese town of Kourou on 23 September, and was transported to Guiana Space Centre Ariane 5 Final Assembly Building for final launch preparation.

Launch of &quot;XMM&quot; took place on 10 December 1999 at 14:32 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre. &quot;XMM&quot; was lofted into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, and placed into a highly elliptical, 40-degree orbit that had a perigee of and an apogee of . Forty minutes after being released from the Ariane upper stage, telemetry confirmed to ground stations that the spacecraft&#x27;s solar arrays had successfully deployed. Engineers waited an additional 22 hours before commanding the on-board propulsion systems to fire a total of five times, which, between 10 and 16 December, changed the orbit to with a 38.9-degree inclination. This resulted in the spacecraft making one complete revolution of the Earth approximately every 48 hours.

Immediately after launch, &quot;XMM&quot; began its Launch and Early Orbit phase of operations. On 17 and 18 December 1999, the X-ray modules and Optical Monitor doors were opened, respectively. Instrument activation started on 4 January 2000, and the Instrument Commissioning phase began on 16 January. The Optical Monitor (OM) attained first light on 5 January, the two European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) MOS-CCDs followed on 16 January and the EPIC pn-CCD on 22 January, and the Reflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS) saw first light on 2 February. On 3 March, the Calibration and Performance Validation phase began, and routine science operations began on 1 June.

During a press conference on 9 February 2000, ESA presented the first images taken by &quot;XMM&quot; and announced that a new name had been chosen for the spacecraft. Whereas the program had formally been known as the High Throughput X-ray Spectroscopy Mission, the new name would reflect the nature of the program and the originator of the field of spectroscopy. Explaining the new name of &quot;XMM-Newton&quot;, Roger Bonnet, ESA&#x27;s former Director of Science, said, &quot;We have chosen this name because Sir Isaac Newton was the man who invented spectroscopy and XMM is a spectroscopy mission.&quot; He noted that because Newton is synonymous with gravity and one of the goals of the satellite was to locate large numbers of black hole candidates, &quot;there was no better choice than XMM-Newton for the name of this mission.&quot;

Including all construction, spacecraft launch, and two years of operation, the project was accomplished within a budget of (1999 conditions).

===Operation===
The spacecraft has the ability to lower the operating temperature of both the EPIC and RGS cameras, a function that was included to counteract the deleterious effects of ionising radiation on the camera pixels. In general, the instruments are cooled to reduce the amount of dark current within the devices. During the night of 3–4 November 2002, RGS-2 was cooled from its initial temperature of down to , and a few hours later to . After analysing the results, it was determined the optimal temperature for both RGS units would be , and during 13–14 November, both RGS-1 and RGS-2 were set to this level. During 6–7 November, the EPIC MOS-CCD detectors were cooled from their initial operating temperature of to a new setting of . After these adjustments, both the EPIC and RGS cameras showed dramatic improvements in quality.

On 18 October 2008, &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; suffered an unexpected communications failure, during which time there was no contact with the spacecraft. While some concern was expressed that the vehicle may have suffered a catastrophic event, photographs taken by amateur astronomers at the Starkenburg Observatory in Germany and at other locations worldwide showed that the spacecraft was intact and appeared on course. A weak signal was finally detected using a antenna in New Norcia, Western Australia, and communication with &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; suggested that the spacecraft&#x27;s Radio Frequency switch had failed. After troubleshooting a solution, ground controllers used NASA&#x27;s antenna at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex to send a command that changed the switch to its last working position. ESA stated in a press release that on 22 October, a ground station at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) made contact with the satellite, confirming the process had worked and that the satellite was back under control.

===Mission extensions===
Because of the spacecraft&#x27;s good health and the significant returns of data, &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; has received several mission extensions by ESA&#x27;s Science Programme Committee. The first extension came during November 2003 and extended operations through March 2008. The second extension was approved in December 2005, extending work through March 2010. A third extension was passed in November 2007, which provided for operations through 2012. As part of the approval, it was noted that the satellite had enough on-board consumables (fuel, power and mechanical health) to theoretically continue operations past 2017. The fourth extension in November 2010 approved operations through 2014. A fifth extension was approved in November 2014 and affirmed in November 2016, continuing operations through 2018. A sixth extension was approved in December 2017, continuing operations through the end of 2020. A seventh extension was approved in November 2018, continuing operations through the end of 2022. An eighth extension was approved in March 2023, continuing operations through the end of 2026, with indicative extension up to 2029.

== Spacecraft ==

&quot;XMM-Newton&quot; is a long space telescope, and is wide with solar arrays deployed. At launch it weighed . The spacecraft has three degrees of stabilisation, which allow it to aim at a target with an accuracy of 0.25 to 1 arcseconds. This stabilisation is achieved through the use of the spacecraft&#x27;s Attitude &amp; Orbit Control Subsystem. These systems also allow the spacecraft to point at different celestial targets, and can turn the craft at a maximum of 90 degrees per hour. The instruments on board &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; are three European Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC), two Reflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS), and an Optical Monitor.

The spacecraft is roughly cylindrical in shape, and has four major components. At the fore of the spacecraft is the &quot;Mirror Support Platform&quot;, which supports the X-ray telescope assemblies and grating systems, the Optical Monitor, and two star trackers. Surrounding this component is the &quot;Service Module&quot;, which carries various spacecraft support systems: computer and electric busses, consumables (such as fuel and coolant), solar arrays, the Telescope Sun Shield, and two S-band antennas. Behind these units is the &quot;Telescope Tube&quot;, a long, hollow carbon fibre structure which provides exact spacing between the mirrors and their detection equipment. This section also hosts outgassing equipment on its exterior, which helps remove any contaminants from the interior of the satellite. At the aft end of spacecraft is the &quot;Focal Plane Assembly&quot;, which supports the Focal Plane Platform (carrying the cameras and spectrometers) and the data-handling, power distribution, and radiator assemblies.

== Instruments ==

=== European Photon Imaging Cameras ===
The three &quot;European Photon Imaging Cameras&quot; (EPIC) are the primary instruments aboard &quot;XMM-Newton&quot;. The system is composed of two MOS–CCD cameras and a single pn-CCD camera, with a total field of view of 30 arcminutes and an energy sensitivity range between (). Each camera contains a six-position filter wheel, with three types of X-ray-transparent filters, a fully open and a fully closed position; each also contains a radioactive source used for internal calibration. The cameras can be independently operated in a variety of modes, depending on the image sensitivity and speed needed, as well as the intensity of the target.

The two MOS-CCD cameras are used to detect low-energy X-rays. Each camera is composed of seven silicon chips (one in the centre and six circling it), with each chip containing a matrix of 600 × 600 pixels, giving the camera a total resolution of about 2.5 megapixels. As discussed above, each camera has a large adjacent radiator which cools the instrument to an operating temperature of . They were developed and built by the University of Leicester Space Research Centre and EEV Ltd.

The pn-CCD camera is used to detect high-energy X-rays, and is composed of a single silicon chip with twelve individual embedded CCDs. Each CCD is 64 × 189 pixels, for a total capacity of 145,000 pixels. At the time of its construction, the pn-CCD camera on &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; was the largest such device ever made, with a sensitive area of . A radiator cools the camera to . This system was made by the Astronomisches Institut Tübingen, the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, and PNSensor, all of Germany.

The EPIC system records three types of data about every X-ray that is detected by its CCD cameras. The time that the X-ray arrives allows scientists to develop light curves, which projects the number of X-rays that arrive over time and shows changes in the brightness of the target. Where the X-ray hits the camera allows for a visible image to be developed of the target. The amount of energy carried by the X-ray can also be detected and helps scientists to determine the physical processes occurring at the target, such as its temperature, its chemical make-up, and what the environment is like between the target and the telescope.

=== Reflection Grating Spectrometers ===
The &quot;Reflection Grating Spectrometers&quot; (RGS) are composed of two Focal Plane Cameras and their associated Reflection Grating Arrays. This system is used to build X-ray spectral data and can determine the elements present in the target, as well as the temperature, quantity and other characteristics of those elements. The RGS system operates in the () range, which allows detection of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon and iron.

The Focal Plane Cameras each consist of nine MOS-CCD devices mounted in a row and following a curve called a Rowland circle. Each CCD contains 384 × 1024 pixels, for a total resolution of more than 3.5 megapixels. The total width and length of the CCD array was dictated by the size of the RGS spectrum and the wavelength range, respectively. Each CCD array is surrounded by a relatively massive wall, providing heat conduction and radiation shielding. Two-stage radiators cool the cameras to an operating temperature of . The camera systems were a joint effort between SRON, the Paul Scherrer Institute, and MSSL, with EEV Ltd and Contraves Space providing hardware.

The Reflection Grating Arrays are attached to two of the primary telescopes. They allow approximately 50% of the incoming X-rays to pass unperturbed to the EPIC system, while redirecting the other 50% onto the Focal Plane Cameras. Each RGA was designed to contain 182 identical gratings, though a fabrication error left one with only 181. Because the telescope mirrors have already focused the X-rays to converge at the focal point, each grating has the same angle of incidence, and as with the Focal Plane Cameras, each grating array conforms to a Rowland circle. This configuration minimises focal aberrations. Each grating is composed of thick silicon carbide substrate covered with a gold film, and is supported by five beryllium stiffeners. The gratings contain a large number of grooves, which actually perform the X-ray deflection; each grating contains an average of 646 grooves per millimetre. The RGAs were built by Columbia University.

=== Optical Monitor ===
The &quot;Optical Monitor&quot; (OM) is a Ritchey–Chrétien optical/ultraviolet telescope designed to provide simultaneous observations alongside the spacecraft&#x27;s X-ray instruments. The OM is sensitive between nanometres in a 17 × 17 arcminute square field of view co-aligned with the centre of the X-ray telescope&#x27;s field of view. It has a focal length of and a focal ratio of ƒ/12.7.

The instrument is composed of the Telescope Module, containing the optics, detectors, processing equipment, and power supply; and the Digital Electronics Module, containing the instrument control unit and data processing units. Incoming light is directed into one of two fully redundant detector systems. The light passes through an 11-position filter wheel (one opaque to block light, six broad band filters, one white light filter, one magnifier, and two grisms), then through an intensifier which amplifies the light by one million times, then onto the CCD sensor. The CCD is 384 × 288 pixels in size, of which 256 × 256 pixels are used for observations; each pixel is further subsampled into 8 × 8 pixels, resulting in a final product that is 2048 × 2048 in size. The Optical Monitor was built by the Mullard Space Science Laboratory with contributions from organisations in the United States and Belgium.

== Telescopes ==

Feeding the EPIC and RGS systems are three telescopes designed specifically to direct X-rays into the spacecraft&#x27;s primary instruments. The telescope assemblies each have a diameter of , are in length, and have a base weight of . The two telescopes with Reflection Grating Arrays weigh an additional . Components of the telescopes include (from front to rear) the mirror assembly door, entrance and X-ray , mirror module, electron deflector, a Reflection Grating Array in two of the assemblies, and exit baffle.

Each telescope consists of 58 cylindrical, nested Wolter Type-1 mirrors developed by Media Lario of Italy, each long and ranging in diameter from , producing a total collecting area of at 1.5 keV and at 8 keV. The mirrors range from thick for the innermost mirror to thick for the outermost mirror, and the separation between each mirror ranges from from innermost to outermost. Each mirror was built by vapour-depositing a 250 nm layer of gold reflecting surface onto a highly polished aluminium mandrel, followed by electroforming a monolithic nickel support layer onto the gold. The finished mirrors were glued into the grooves of an Inconel spider, which keeps them aligned to within the five-micron tolerance required to achieve adequate X-ray resolution. The mandrels were manufactured by Carl Zeiss AG, and the electroforming and final assembly were performed by Media Lario with contributions from Kayser-Threde.

== Subsystems ==

=== Attitude &amp; Orbit Control System ===
Spacecraft three-axis attitude control is handled by the &quot;Attitude &amp; Orbit Control System&quot; (AOCS), composed of four reaction wheels, four inertial measurement units, two star trackers, three fine Sun sensors, and three Sun acquisition sensors. The AOCS was provided by Matra Marconi Space of the United Kingdom.

Coarse spacecraft orientation and orbit maintenance is provided by two sets of four hydrazine thrusters (primary and backup). The hydrazine thrusters were built by DASA-RI of Germany.

The AOCS was upgraded in 2013 with a software patch (&#x27;4WD&#x27;), to control attitude using the 3 prime reaction wheels plus the 4th, spare wheel, unused since launch, with the aim of saving propellant to extend the spacecraft lifetime. In 2019 the fuel was predicted to last until 2030.

=== Power systems ===
Primary power for &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; is provided by two fixed solar arrays. The arrays are composed of six panels measuring for a total of and a mass of . At launch, the arrays provided 2,200 W of power, and were expected to provide 1,600 W after ten years of operation. Deployment of each array took four minutes. The arrays were provided by Fokker Space of the Netherlands.

When direct sunlight is unavailable, power is provided by two nickel–cadmium batteries providing 24 A·h and weighing each. The batteries were provided by SAFT of France.

=== Radiation Monitor System ===
The cameras are accompanied by the &quot;EPIC Radiation Monitor System&quot; (ERMS), which measures the radiation environment surrounding the spacecraft; specifically, the ambient proton and electron flux. This provides warning of damaging radiation events to allow for automatic shut-down of the sensitive camera CCDs and associated electronics. The ERMS was built by the Centre d&#x27;Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements of France.

=== Visual Monitoring Cameras ===
The &quot;Visual Monitoring Cameras&quot; (VMC) on the spacecraft were added to monitor the deployment of solar arrays and the sun shield, and have additionally provided images of the thrusters firing and outgassing of the Telescope Tube during early operations. Two VMCs were installed on the Focal Plane Assembly looking forward. The first is FUGA-15, a black and white camera with high dynamic range and 290 × 290 pixel resolution. The second is IRIS-1, a colour camera with a variable exposure time and 400 × 310 pixel resolution. Both cameras measure and weight . They use active pixel sensors, a technology that was new at the time of &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; development. The cameras were developed by and IMEC, both of Belgium.

== Ground systems ==
&quot;XMM-Newton&quot; mission control is located at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Two ground stations, located in Perth and Kourou, are used to maintain continuous contact with the spacecraft through most of its orbit. Back-up ground stations are located in Villafranca del Castillo, Santiago, and Dongara. Because &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; contains no on-board data storage, science data is transmitted to these ground stations in real time.

Data is then forwarded to the European Space Astronomy Centre Science Operations Centre in Villafranca del Castillo, Spain, where pipeline processing has been performed since March 2012. Data is archived at the ESAC Science Data Centre, and distributed to mirror archives at the Goddard Space Flight Center and the XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre (SSC) at the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie. Prior to June 2013, the SSC was operated by the University of Leicester, but operations were transferred due to a withdrawal of funding by the United Kingdom.

== Observations and discoveries ==
The space observatory was used to discover the galaxy cluster XMMXCS 2215-1738, 10 billion light years away from Earth.

The object SCP 06F6, discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in February 2006, was observed by &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; in early August 2006 and appeared to show an X-ray glow around it two orders of magnitude more luminous than that of supernovae.

In June 2011, a team from the University of Geneva, Switzerland, reported &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; seeing a flare that lasted four hours at a peak intensity of 10,000 times the normal rate, from an observation of Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient IGR J18410-0535, where a blue supergiant star shed a plume of matter that was partly ingested by a smaller companion neutron star with accompanying X-ray emissions.

In February 2013 it was announced that &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; along with NuSTAR have for the first time measured the spin rate of a supermassive black hole, by observing the black hole at the core of galaxy NGC 1365. At the same time, it verified the model that explains the distortion of X-rays emitted from a black hole.

In February 2014, separate analyses extracted from the spectrum of X-ray emissions observed by &quot;XMM-Newton&quot; a monochromatic signal around 3.5 keV. This signal is coming from different galaxy clusters, and several scenarios of dark matter can justify such a line. For example, a 3.5 keV candidate annihilating into 2 photons, or a 7 keV dark matter particle decaying into photon and neutrino.

In June 2021, one of the largest X-ray surveys using the European Space Agency&#x27;s XMM-Newton space observatory published initial findings, mapping the growth of 12,000 supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

<text>The Automated Transfer Vehicle, originally Ariane Transfer Vehicle or ATV, was an expendable cargo spacecraft developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), used for space cargo transport in 2008–2015. The ATV design was launched to orbit five times, exclusively by the Ariane 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle. It effectively was a larger European counterpart to the Russian Progress cargo spacecraft for carrying upmass to a single destination—the International Space Station (ISS)—but with three times the capacity.

== History ==
The five ATVs were named after important European figures in science and engineering: &quot;Jules Verne&quot;, &quot;Johannes Kepler&quot;, &quot;Edoardo Amaldi&quot;, &quot;Albert Einstein&quot;, and &quot;Georges Lemaître&quot;. Following several delays to the program, the first of these was launched in March 2008. These ATVs performed supply missions to the ISS, transporting various payloads such as propellant, water, air, food, and scientific research equipment; ATVs also reboosted the station into a higher orbit while docked. The ATV was an uncrewed platform that operated with a high level of automation, such as its docking sequence; at no point was it used for transporting passengers.

Further use of the ATV was proposed in 2008. Various further developments, including crewed versions of the ATV as well as opportunities to reuse sections or elements of its technology, were studied by both the ESA and Airbus Defence and Space, the principal manufacturer of the vehicle. 
However, on 2 April 2012, the ESA announced that the ATV program would be terminated following the launch of the fifth ATV in 2014.

In 2012, ESA member states decided that the ATV design might be adapted to serve as the service module of the NASA Orion spacecraft. 
In January 2013, ESA and NASA announced that they would proceed with a combined Orion and ATV derived service module, later renamed European Service Module (ESM), which would serve as a major component for the Orion crewed spacecraft. NASA’s Artemis I launched on November 16, 2022, carried the Orion spacecraft with the European Service Module (ESM) manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space for two planned low fly-by orbits to the Moon. ESA will provide the ESMs for the Artemis program up to Artemis VI with Artemis III to provide the first humans to set foot on the Moon since 1972.

==Development==
===Origins===
During the 1990s, as the International Space Station program was taking place, it was collectively recognised by the 15 participating nations that, upon completion, the International Space Station (ISS), a crewed space station in Low Earth orbit (LEO), would require regular resupply missions in order to meet the needs of the onboard crew as well as to deliver apparatus to support the various scientific tests that would be performed on board. In October 1995, it was agreed that, amongst the various contributions to the ISS program that Europe would assume responsibility for under the auspices of the European Space Agency (ESA), one of them would be the &quot;Automated Transfer Vehicle&quot;, or ATV; this logistics-orientated spacecraft would perform the identified resupply missions to the ISS.

On 9 December 1998, the ESA awarded a $470 million contract to proceed with development work on the ATV to French aerospace company Aérospatiale. While Aérospatiale served as the principal contractor for the ATV, it was joined by multiple major subcontractors, including Italian manufacturer Alenia Spazio, Franco-British firm Matra Marconi Space and German aerospace company DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA); some components were also provided by Russian firm S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia. Prior to 2000, DASA was to serve as the prime contractor for production, after which the role would be gradually transferred to Aérospatiale. At the point at which the contract had been awarded, it was envisioned that the first flight of the ATV would be conducted during September 2003.

The launch of the first ATV, which had been named &quot;Jules Verne&quot;, was subject to multiple delays, which were partially generated by problems encountered with the Ariane 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle, as well as a substantial software re-write. By May 2003, it was set to be launched sometime during late 2004. By mid 2004, it had been announced that launch of the first ATV, which was by then undergoing electrical testing following the completion of integration work, had been postponed due to technical issues, and was reportedly scheduled to be launched during late 2005, following the issuing of a renegotiated $1.1 billion contract between the ESA and the prime contractor. In March 2005, another launch delay was declared, due to the need for greater development of the failure-mode software along with launch-window timing changes, which put the planned ATV launch back from late 2005 to an undetermined date during 2006. In October 2005, it was clarified that the new launch date for the first ATV would be during 2007.

In September 2006, it was announced that the final stage of testing on the Ariane 5&#x27;s customised ATV stage was within its final phase. In December 2006, it was announced that the first ATV had completed its vacuum test, marking the successful completion of the key tests and enabling a final launch date to be set. In April 2007, the ATV was subject to four-month long qualification process in response to operational concerns, including safety queries originating from the U.S., and to examine the vehicle&#x27;s potential commercialisation.

===Production===
Following multiple restructuring and ownership changes, the prime contractor for the ATV became Airbus Defence and Space, which led a consortium of many sub-contractors. While development work had been started in Les Mureaux, France, much of the activity relocated to Bremen, Germany, as the project moved from its development to the production stage, in which work on the four initial units started. In order to facilitate the relationship between the contractor and the ESA, an integrated ESA team at the Les Mureaux site was established and maintained for the duration of the development.

Airbus Defence and Space builds the ATVs in its facility in Bremen. In 2004, contracts and accords were signed for four additional ATVs, which were envisioned to be launched at a rate of around one every two years, bringing the total order, including the first, &quot;Jules-Verne&quot;, to five vehicles. According to the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the development cost of the ATV was approximately €1.35 billion. Reportedly, each ATV spacecraft was costed at roughly US$300 million, which did not include launch costs. In March 2005, RSC Energia signed a €40 million contract with one of the main subcontractors of Airbus Defence and Space, the Italian company Alenia Spazio (now Thales Alenia Space), to supply the Russian Docking System, refuelling system, and Russian Equipment Control System. Within the Airbus Defence and Space led project, Thales Alenia Space is responsible for the pressurized cargo carrier section of the ATV and manufactures these at the firm&#x27;s facility in Turin, Italy.

On 31 July 2007, the first ATV, &quot;Jules Verne&quot;, arrived at the ESA spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, after a nearly two-week journey from Rotterdam harbour. On 9 March 2008, &quot;Jules Verne&quot; was launched on top of an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou. On 3 April 2008, &quot;Jules Verne&quot; succeeded in automatically docking with the ISS, proving the capabilities of the ESA&#x27;s first fully automated, expendable cargo resupply spacecraft. The arrival of the ATV came at a time at which there were public concerns over the logistical practicality of supplying the ISS.

In addition to its use by ESA and Russia, the ATV was at one point under consideration to perform services for NASA as part of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program to replace the retiring Space Shuttle in its orbital cargo carrying capacity. Under the proposal, which had been issued by a joint venture between EADS and Boeing, the ATV would be launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, using a Delta IV rocket. One speculated use for NASA&#x27;s ATV was to achieve the de-orbiting of the ISS once the space station had reached the end of its service life, being the only vehicle capable of doing so at that time after the Shuttle&#x27;s retirement. Ultimately, the proposal was not awarded with a corresponding contract.

==Design==
The &quot;Automated Transfer Vehicle&quot; (ATV) was a 1990s-design expendable cargo spacecraft. Each vehicle consisted of two distinct sections, the systems bus and the integrated cargo carrier. The system bus contained the ATV&#x27;s propulsion system, avionics bays, and solar arrays; it was principally used following the vehicle&#x27;s detachment from the Ariane 5 launcher to automatically traverse the remaining distance and dock with the ISS, the system bus would be inaccessible to the astronauts on board. The integrated cargo carrier consisted of a pressurised module, external bays for fluid and gas cargoes, further avionics and rendezvous sensors, and the docking mechanism. The primary structure of the ATV (of Al-2219) is protected by a meteorite and debris protection system. The first ATV was built in the 2000s and the first one to fly in space was in 2008.

The docking system of the ATV consists of a pair of videometers and a pair of telegoniometers manufactured by Sodern, a subsidiary of Airbus. Data processing for the rendezvous docking maneuver and emergency abort systems were designed and manufactured by CRISA. Additional monitoring data and redundancy was provided by the Kurs automatic docking system, which was also used by Soyuz and Progress spacecraft. Visual imagery is provided by a camera on the &quot;Zvezda&quot; ISS module.

In terms of its role, the ATV was designed to complement the smaller Russian Progress spacecraft, possessing three times its useful payload capacity. Similar to the Progress, it would carry both bulk liquids and relatively fragile freight, which would be stored within a cargo hold maintained at a pressurized shirt-sleeve environment in order that astronauts would be able to access payloads without the need to put on spacesuits. 
The pressurized cargo section of the ATV was based on the Italian-built Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), which was a Shuttle-carried &quot;space barge/container&quot; that had been previously used for transporting equipment to and from the Station. Unlike the MPLM which had to be berthed to the ISS, the ATV used the same docking mechanism as employed upon the Progress. The ATV, like the Progress, also serves as a container for the station&#x27;s waste. Each ATV weighs 20.7 tonnes at launch and has a cargo capacity of 8 tonnes:
* to of dry cargo (re-supply goods, scientific payload, etc.),
* Up to of water,
* Up to of gas (nitrogen, oxygen, air), with up to two gases per flight,
* Up to of propellant for the &quot;re-boost&quot; maneuver and refueling the station. The ATV propellant used for &quot;re-boost&quot; (monomethylhydrazine fuel and N2O4 oxidizer) is of a different type from the &quot;payload&quot; refueling propellant (UDMH fuel and N2O4 oxidizer).

The system bus section of the ATV had solar panels (3,800 W), 40 Ah of batteries, propellant tanks, four R-4D (490 N) thrusters, and 28 attitude control and braking thrusters (220 N).

== Use and operation==

ATVs were intended to be routinely launched every 17 months to conduct resupply missions to the International Space Station. The vehicle was launched into an orbital plane compatible with the ISS via the Ariane 5 expendable launch system; shortly after detaching from the launcher, the ATV would deploy its solar panels. Over an average mission time of 100 hours, it would perform phasing manoeuvers from its initial orbital high point under direct control from the ground-based European Space Operations Centre at Darmstadt, Germany, using NASA&#x27;s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. A second series of manoeuvres would bring the ATV to the precise altitude of the ISS before commencing integrated operations for the final approach with the Space Station, during which mission authority transferred to NASA&#x27;s Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.

The ATV would employ a combination of GPS and astronavigation techniques to automatically rendezvous with the Space Station. Telemetry contact was established between the ISS and ATV during its preparations for the final approach. Once at a distance of 249 m, the onboard computers of the ATV employed both videometer and telegoniometer data to perform the final approach and docking manoeuvres; the docking itself to the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module, was fully automated. In the event of any last-minute technical issues or problems, a pre-programmed sequence of anti-collision manoeuvres, fully independent of the main navigation system, can be activated by the flight engineers aboard the station. Upon contact with the module, the automatic capture sequence would be activated.

Once the ATV had successfully docked, the station crew would be able to enter the vehicle&#x27;s cargo section and directly access the payload on board. The ATV&#x27;s liquid tanks would be connected to the station&#x27;s plumbing by the crew to discharge their contents in a controlled manner, while the station crew would manually release air components directly into the ISS&#x27;s atmosphere. For up to six months, the ATV, which would remain mainly in dormant mode, could remain attached to the ISS with the hatch remaining open throughout. The crew would then steadily fill the cargo section with the station&#x27;s waste material for disposal. At intervals of 10 to 45 days, the ATV would be reactivated and its thrusters would typically be used to boost the station&#x27;s altitude.

Once its mission was accomplished, the ATV, which would often be filled with up to 6.5 tonnes of waste, would separate from the ISS. Its thrusters would deliberately move the spacecraft out of orbit (de-orbit) and place it on a steep flight path to perform a controlled destructive re-entry high above the Pacific Ocean.

== Missions ==
On 2 April 2012, the ESA announced that the ATV program that had paid their share of the ISS running costs until 2017 would end after the fifth ATV had been launched in 2014, at that point they had the required components to assemble the next two but beyond that avionics components utilised in the design were no longer being manufactured. A similar deal to provide their share of the ISS operating costs through hardware contribution to the Orion programme was mooted.

=== &quot;Jules Verne&quot; ===
The first flight of the ATV was delayed on multiple occasions prior to its launch on 9 March 2008. It was named &quot;Jules Verne&quot;, in memory of the first science fiction writer of modern times. The &quot;Jules Verne&quot; carried two of the author&#x27;s original handwritten manuscripts, to be received by the ISS crew as symbolic tokens of the success of the maiden flight.

The craft was launched into a orbit atop an Ariane 5 rocket from the equatorial ELA-3 launch site at the Guiana Space Centre. The ATV separated from the rocket, and following weeks of tests and orbit adjustments, successfully docked in the International Space Station at 14:45 UTC on 3 April 2008.

In the early morning hours of 29 September 2008, the Jules Verne burnt up on entering the atmosphere above an uninhabited section of the Pacific Ocean, southwest of Tahiti.

=== &quot;Johannes Kepler&quot; ===
Launched on 17 February 2011, Johannes Kepler was at the time the heaviest payload ever launched by the European Space Agency and carried 7000 kg of cargo to the ISS. The first launch attempt on 15 February 2011 had been halted during the final countdown at four minutes from lift off due to an erroneous signal from one of the rocket&#x27;s fuel tanks.

On 29 April 2011, the engines of the ATV were used to rotate the ISS in order for a Russian Progress supply craft to dock with the station.

Due to the delayed launch of STS-134 the mission of &quot;Johannes Kepler&quot; was extended, and it undocked from the ISS on 20 June 2011. It deorbited a day later on 21 June 2011.

=== &quot;Edoardo Amaldi&quot; ===
The third ATV vehicle arrived in French Guiana in late August 2011 and was launched on 23 March 2012. It docked with the International Space Station at 2231 GMT on 28 March 2012.

=== &quot;Albert Einstein&quot; ===

&quot;Albert Einstein&quot; ATV was the heaviest spacecraft launched by Ariane at the time and lifted off at 21:52:11 GMT on 5 June 2013. It docked with the ISS on 15 June 2013 at 14:07 GMT.

=== &quot;Georges Lemaître&quot; ===

Named after the Belgian astronomer Georges Lemaître. The spacecraft launched during the night of 29 July (23:44 GMT, 20:44 local time, 30 July 01:44 CEST), 2014, on a mission to supply the International Space Station (ISS) with propellant, water, air, and dry cargo, and an artwork by artist Katie Paterson. It docked with the ISS on 12 August at 13:30 GMT. &quot;Georges Lemaître&quot; had a total mass of almost , a mass that exceeded that of all previously launched ATVs. This also made it the heaviest spacecraft ever launched by an Ariane rocket.

== ATV Control Centre ==

ATV missions were monitored and controlled from the ATV Control Centre (ATV-CC), located at the Toulouse Space Centre (CST) in Toulouse, France. The ATV-CC was responsible for the planning and the issuing of commands for the orbital maneuvers and mission tasks of each ATV, from the moment of separation from its launch vehicle, until it burns up in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The ATV-CC has a direct communication line with the Columbus Control Center (Col-CC) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. Col-CC provides ATV-CC with access to both the NASA&#x27;s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and the European Artemis communication networks in order to communicate with both the ATV and the ISS. The ATV-CC coordinated its actions with NASA&#x27;s Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center (MCC-H) in Houston and the Russian FKA Mission Control Center (TsUP or MCC-M) in Moscow, as well as the ATV launch site at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana.

== Basis for European Service Module ==
In May 2011 the ESA director general announced a possible collaboration with NASA to work on a successor to the ATV. Later that year, a proposal to utilise an ATV derived service module for NASA&#x27;s Orion capsule was revealed. This service module would be provided as barter for the ESA&#x27;s 8% share of the operating expense of the ISS, which had been fulfilled up to 2017 by the five ATVs. Developing a service module for Orion would cover the ESA&#x27;s share of ISS operation up to 2020. 

In June 2012, the ESA awarded two separate studies to Airbus, each worth €6.5 million, to evaluate options for using technology and experience gained from ATV and &quot;Columbus&quot; related work to cover the ESA&#x27;s share of ISS operation past 2017. One study looked into developing a service module for Orion, while the other examined development of a multipurpose vehicle that could resupply space stations, remove debris, and service satellites in orbit. The studies were to be completed before the end of 2012.

At the meeting of the ESA Ministerial Council in November 2012, the ESA committed to developing the service module, and in mid-December signed an agreement with NASA to provide an ATV derived Orion service module for the maiden launch of Orion on the Space Launch System. The module is referred as European Service Module (ESM).

The ESA awarded Airbus Defence and Space a €390 million ($488 million) contract in November 2014 to develop and build the ESM.

== Evolution proposals ==
In addition to its principal role as a one-way uncrewed cargo transfer vehicle, from the onset of work on the project, the ESA had viewed the ATV as having the potential for being the starting point for a whole family of automated space vehicles. Amongst the conceived missions for ATV-derived vehicles have been orbital automated construction programmes and independent bases for experiments, as well as a potential upgraded version of the ATV that would survive reentry intact, enabling its use as a two-way cargo transfer vehicle. The potential commercialisation of the ATV was also the subject of a formal study conducted by the ESA, during which the prospects of using the spacecraft as a dedicated tug for satellites, as well as the use of alternative launch systems, were examined.

Following the decision by NASA to retire the Space Shuttle in 2011, the ESA decided to launch a further series of studies to determine the potential for evolutions and adaptations of the ATV. As a result of these studies, the cargo return version (CARV) was identified as a particularly promising candidate for further development. The goal of this variant is to provide ESA with the capability to transport scientific data and cargo from the ISS to Earth. Beyond this, CARV could be enhanced to become a crew vehicle which would be launched by an adapted Ariane 5.

; Mini Space Station: The MSS concept is an ATV evolution proposal for the construction of multiple ATVs with two docking ports, one at each end. The current version of the ATV is already prepared for a docking port at the back, with the main propulsion system arranged in a cylindrical fashion leaving room for a tunnel through the middle. This concept would allow Soyuz, Progress and other ATVs to dock to the back of the ATV, allowing a steady flow of Russian vehicles using the available docking ports whilst an ATV is docked for an average of around 6 months at a time.

; Payload Retrieval System: The PARES would have included a small ballistic capsule similar to VBK-Raduga embedded into the ATV docking interface, which would have brought back a few tens of kilograms of payload. PARES could have featured a deployable heat shield system. The European Space Agency was also proposing the system for use with the Progress spacecraft and the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV).

; Cargo Ascent and Return Vehicle: The CARV would deliver a redesigned capsule, capable of bringing back payload from orbit. It could be installed in place of the ATV pressurized cargo hold. In addition, it could be adapted to use a berth rather than a docking port at the US side of the station. Given the larger berthing ports there, it would be possible to transfer complete International Standard Payload Racks (ISPRs) from the ATV to the station, which is only possible with the H-II Transfer Vehicle.

; Crew Transport Vehicle:This is another option under consideration. Similar to the CARV variant, this would replace the current Integrated Cargo Carrier with a pressurized re-entry capsule. A significant difference with the cargo-only variant would be the presence of a Crew Escape System, consisting of a number of booster rockets able to pull the crew capsule away from the launcher (Ariane 5) and/or Service Module in the event of an emergency. The CTV variant of the ATV could be able to seat 4 or 5 crew members.

Possibilities for launching of the ATV on other launchers than the Ariane 5 have also been investigated, in particular in the frame of Commercial Orbital Transportation Services. ESA and its member states will consider approval for further ATV development in the coming years.

=== Proposed crewed version ===
Both the ESA and the manufacturing team have considered various programmes under which the ATV, or portions of the technologies composing it, would have been developed into a crewed configuration.

On 14 May 2008, aerospace company EADS Astrium and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), announced that they were actively pursuing a development project with the aim of adapting the ATV into a crew transportation system. In the envisioned configuration, the craft would be able to launch a 3-person crew beyond LEO via use of a modified version of the Ariane 5 rocket and would be more spacious than the Russian Soyuz. A mock-up of the proposed craft was publicly displayed at the 2008 International Aerospace Exhibition in Berlin. If the project were to have been given ESA approval, development would have proceeded in two stages:

* The first stage would have involved the development of an Advanced Reentry Vehicle (ARV) capable of transporting up to 1,500 kg of cargo from space to earth safely (see &quot;CARV&quot; above) by 2015. This capability would be available to ESA even if further development were to be halted. It would prove useful in the ISS program as well as the proposed Mars Sample Return Mission with NASA. ARV development would make use of work done on the Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator, Crew Return Vehicle and related projects. The budget for this stage of the ATV overhaul would reportedly be €300 million.
* The second stage would adapt the then existing capsule to be able to transport people safely as well as upgrade the propulsion and other systems in the service module and would last 4 to 5 years at a cost of &quot;a couple of billion [euro]&quot; according to a senior Astrium representative.

In November 2008, ESA ministers budgeted for a feasibility study into developing a re-entry capsule for the ATV, a requirement for developing either a cargo return capacity or a crew version of the ATV. On 7 July 2009, the ESA signed a €21 million study contract with EADS Astrium. The ARV effort was ultimately discontinued after completing the B1 stage due to fiscal constraints resulting from the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

==Exoliner==
During the 2010s, Lockheed Martin put together a proposal for Commercial Resupply Services 2 that included a new diameter cargo transport module called &quot;Exoliner&quot;, which was based on the ATV and was to be jointly developed with Thales Alenia Space.

<text>The Indianapolis Motor Speedway is a motor racing circuit located in Speedway, Indiana, United States, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. It is the home of the Indianapolis 500 and the Brickyard 400 and formerly the home of the United States Grand Prix and Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix. It is located west of Downtown Indianapolis.

Constructed in 1909, it is the second purpose-built, banked oval racing circuit after Brooklands and the first to be called a &#x27;speedway&#x27;. It is the third-oldest permanent automobile race track in the world, behind Brooklands and the Milwaukee Mile. With a permanent seating capacity of 257,325, it is the highest-capacity sports venue in the world.

The track is a rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its construction. It has two straightaways, four geometrically identical turns, connected by two short straightaways, termed &quot;short chutes&quot;, between turns 1 and 2, and between turns 3 and 4. The turns have 9°12&#x27; banking, considered relatively flat by American standards.

A modern, FIA Grade One infield road course was completed in 2000, incorporating part of the oval, including the main stretch and the southwest turn, measuring . In 2008, and again in 2014, the road course layout was modified to accommodate motorcycle racing, as well as to improve competition. Altogether, the current grounds have expanded from an original on which the speedway was first built to cover an area of over . Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, it is the only such site to be affiliated with automotive racing history.

In addition to the Indianapolis 500, the speedway also hosts NASCAR&#x27;s Brickyard 400 and Pennzoil 250. From 2000 to 2007, the speedway hosted the Formula One United States Grand Prix, and from 2008 to 2015 the Moto GP. The speedway served as the venue for the opening ceremonies for the 1987 Pan American Games.

On the grounds of the speedway is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum, which opened in 1956, and houses the Hall of Fame. The museum moved into its current building located in the infield in 1976. Also on the grounds is the Brickyard Crossing Golf Resort, which originally opened as the Speedway Golf Course in 1929. The golf course has 14 holes outside the track, along the backstretch, and four holes in the infield. The site is among the most visited attractions in the Indianapolis metropolitan area, with 1 million guests annually. The track is nicknamed &quot;The Brickyard&quot; (see below), and the venue self-describes as the &quot;Racing Capital of the World&quot;. The garage area is known as Gasoline Alley, though Indy 500 racecars have used methanol and currently ethanol.

The Speedway is owned by Roger Penske&#x27;s company Penske Corporation, following its 2019 purchase of Hulman &amp; Company and its assets, which included the Speedway, the IndyCar Series, and associated enterprises.

==History==
===Early history===
Indianapolis businessman Carl G. Fisher first envisioned building the speedway in 1905 after assisting friends racing in France and seeing that Europe held the upper hand in automobile design and craftsmanship. Fisher began thinking of a better means of testing cars before delivering them to consumers. At the time, racing was just getting started on horse tracks and public roads. Fisher noticed how dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing. He also argued that spectators did not get their money&#x27;s worth, as they were able to get only a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.

Fisher proposed building a circular track long with smooth surfaces. Such a track would give manufacturers a chance to test cars at sustained speeds and give drivers a chance to learn their limits. Fisher predicted speeds could reach up to on a course. He visited the Brooklands circuit outside London in 1907, and after viewing the banked layout, it solidified his determination to build the speedway. With dozens of car makers and suppliers in Indiana, Fisher proclaimed, &quot;Indianapolis is going to be the world&#x27;s greatest center of horseless carriage manufacturer, what could be more logical than building the world&#x27;s greatest racetrack right here?&quot;

Fisher began looking around the Indianapolis area for a site to build his track; he rejected two potential sites before finding level farmland, Pressley Farm, totaling about outside Indianapolis. In December 1908, he convinced James A. Allison, Arthur C. Newby, and Frank H. Wheeler to join him in purchasing the property for $72,000. The group incorporated the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Company on March 20, 1909, with a capitalization of $250,000, with Fisher and James Allison in for $75,000 apiece and Frank Wheeler and Arthur Newby on board for $50,000 each.

Construction of the track started in March 1909. Fisher had to quickly downsize his planned oval with a road course to a oval to leave room for the grandstands. Reshaping of the land for the speedway took 500 laborers, 300 mules and a fleet of steam-powered machinery. The track surface consisted of graded and packed soil covered by of gravel, of limestone covered with taroid (a solution of tar and oil), of crushed stone chips that were also drenched with taroid, and a final topping of crushed stone. Workers also constructed dozens of buildings, several bridges, grandstands with 12,000 seats, and an perimeter fence. A white-with-green-trim paint scheme was used throughout the property.

The first event ever held at the speedway was a helium gas-filled balloon competition on Saturday, June 5, 1909, more than two months before the oval was completed. The event drew a reported 40,000 people. Nine balloons lifted off &quot;racing&quot; for trophies; a balloon by the name of &quot;Universal City&quot; won the race, landing away in Alabama after spending more than a day aloft. The first motorsport event at the track consisted of seven motorcycle races, sanctioned by the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM), on August 14, 1909. This was originally planned as a two-day, 15-race program, but ended before the first day was completed due to concerns over suitability of the track surface for motorcycle use. These early events were largely planned by one of the top names in early auto racing promotion, Ernest Moross, who earned fame for his bold and sometimes outlandish barnstorming events at fairgrounds tracks with racing star Barney Oldfield.

On August 19, 1909, fifteen carmakers&#x27; teams arrived at the track for practice. The track surface again became a concern with drivers being covered in dirt, oil, and tar and with ruts and chuckholes beginning to form in the turns. Speedway workers oiled and rolled the track prior to the gates opening to the public. Fifteen to twenty thousand spectators showed up, paying at the most $1 for a ticket. Louis Schwitzer won the first race held, a 5-mile, two lap event. Halfway through the first event, race leader Louis Chevrolet was temporarily blinded when a stone smashed his goggles. William Bourque, driving in a Knox, suffered a suspected rear-axle failure resulting in his car flipping end over end on the front stretch before crashing into a fence post. Both he and his mechanic, Harry Halcomb, died at the scene.

The first day of car racing resulted in four finishes and two land speed records, but concerns over safety led AAA officials to consider canceling the remaining events. Fisher promised the track would be repaired by the next day and convinced officials that the show should go on. The second day saw 20,000 spectators, no major incidents, and additional speed records broken.

On the third day of racing, 35,000 spectators showed up to watch the grand finale race. At into the race, the right front tire blew on Charlie Merz&#x27;s car. His car mowed down five fence posts and toppled dozens of spectators. Two spectators and his mechanic, Claude Kellum, were killed in the crash. Ten laps later, driver Bruce Keen struck a pothole and crashed into a bridge support. The race was then halted and the remaining drivers were given engraved certificates instead of trophies. The race resulted in the AAA boycotting any future events at the speedway until significant improvements were made.

Fisher and his partners began looking into the idea of paving the track with bricks or concrete. Paving in 1909 was still relatively new with only a few miles of public roads paved, leaving little knowledge of what would work best. Traction tests were conducted on bricks, proving they could hold up. Less than a month after the first car races, the repaving project began. Five Indiana manufacturers supplied 3.2 million bricks to the track. Each was hand laid over a cushion of sand, then leveled and the gaps filled with mortar. At the same time, a concrete wall tall was constructed in front of the main grandstand and around all four corners to protect spectators.
The final &quot;gold&quot; brick (actually gold-plated brass) was laid in a special ceremony by Governor Thomas R. Marshall. Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track The Brickyard. Today, , or one yard, of original bricks remain exposed at the start-finish line.

In December 1909, eleven drivers and a few motorcyclists returned for speed trials. Drivers soon reached speeds of up to on the new surface. Racing returned in 1910, with a total of 66 automobile races held during three holiday weekends (Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day). Each weekend featured two or three races of , with several shorter contests. Each race stood on its own and earned its own trophy. All races were sanctioned by the AAA (as were the Indianapolis 500 races through 1955). 1910 also saw the speedway host the National Aviation Meet, featuring Wilbur and Orville Wright and highlighted by Walter Brookins setting a world record by taking a plane up to .

===Start of the Indianapolis 500 era (1911–1929)===
A change in marketing focus led to only one race per year beginning in 1911. An estimated 80,000 spectators attended the first race on Memorial Day, May 30, 1911. Forty cars competed with Ray Harroun winning at an average speed of . While all the other drivers in the race had a riding mechanic in their car, Harroun decided to save weight and go faster by driving solo. So, to be able to see what was happening behind his No. 32 Marmon &quot;Wasp&quot;, he installed a rear-view mirror. It was the first time such a device was used in an automobile.
A classic race followed in 1912, when Ralph DePalma lost a five-lap lead with five laps to go after his car broke down. As DePalma pushed his car around the circuit, Joe Dawson made up the deficit to win. Three of the next four winners were European, with DePalma being the exception as an American national, though originally Italian born. These races gave Indy a worldwide reputation and international drivers began to enter. The 1916 race was shortened to 120 laps, for a number of reasons including a lack of entries from Europe (there were so few entries that the speedway itself entered several cars), a lack of oil, and out of respect for the war in Europe.

On September 9, 1916, the speedway hosted a day of short racing events termed the &quot;Harvest Classic&quot;, composed of three races held at 20-, 50-, and 100-mile (32, 80 and 160 km) distances. In the end, Johnny Aitken, in a Peugeot, would win all three events, his final victories at the facility. The Harvest Classic contests were the last races other than the Indianapolis 500 to be held on the grounds for seventy-eight years.

Racing was interrupted in 1917–1918 by World War I when the facility served as a military aviation repair and refueling depot, designated the Speedway Aviation Repair Depot, commanded by Captain Patrick Frissell. When racing resumed, speeds quickly increased.

In 1921, speedway co-founder Wheeler committed suicide.

At the 1925 event, Pete DePaolo became the first to average 100 mph (160 km/h) for the race, with a speed of .

In July 1926, the neighborhood around the racetrack voted to incorporate itself (along with the track) as the independent town of Speedway, Indiana.

In 1926, Fisher and Allison were offered &quot;a fortune&quot; for the speedway site by a local real estate developer. They refused, selling instead to former racing driver (and World War One fighter ace) Edward V. Rickenbacker in 1927. How much he paid was not revealed. Rickenbacker built a golf course in the infield. The next year, Allison died from pneumonia.

===&quot;Junkyard&quot; formula (1930s)===

With the Great Depression hitting the nation, the purse dropped from a winners share of $50,000 and a total of $98,250 in 1930 to $18,000 and $54,450, respectively. There is a common misconception the rules were &quot;dumbed down&quot; to what was called the &quot;junkyard formula&quot; to allow more entries during the depression. The rules were indeed changed, but it was due to an effort by the speedway to get more car manufacturers involved in the race by discouraging the entry of specialized racing machines that dominated the 500 during the mid- to late-1920s. The rule changes, in fact, were already being laid out before the market crash.

In 1931, Dave Evans performed a remarkable feat when his Cummins Diesel Special completed the entire 500 miles without a pit stop. It was also the first diesel entrant.

In 1933, a record 42 cars started the 500. For 1934, a maximum fuel consumption limit was imposed, . It became in 1935 and in 1936. When the limits resulted in several top competitors running out of fuel in the closing stages, the limits were abandoned, though the use of pump gasoline was still mandatory.

By the early 1930s, rising race speeds began to make the track increasingly dangerous, and in the period 1931–1935, there were 15 fatalities. This forced another repavement, with tarmac replacing the bricks in parts of the track. In addition, during the 1935–36 seasons the inside wall was removed in the corners, the outside wall was realigned (to change the angle compared to the track, reducing the potential for cars to vault over it), hard crash helmets became mandatory, and the first yellow light system was installed around the track. The continuing track dangers during this period, however, did not stop Louis Meyer or Wilbur Shaw from becoming the first two three-time winners, with Shaw also being the first back-to-back winner in 1939 and 1940.

===Start of the Hulman era (1940s)===

At the beginning of the 1940s, the track required further improvements. In 1941, about a third of the &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; garage area burned down before the race. With U.S. involvement in World War II, the 1942 500-mile race was canceled in December 1941. Owner Eddie Rickenbacker said the race would be suspended for the duration of the war. In 1942, AAA Contest Board suspended all auto racing, and the U.S. government moved to ban all auto racing, primarily on account of rationing. The race would not be held for four years (1942–1945). The track was more or less abandoned during the war and fell into a state of disrepair.

Many of the locals conceded that the speedway would be sold after the war and become a housing development. With the end of the war in sight, on November 29, 1944, three-time 500 winner Wilbur Shaw came back to do a tire test approved by the government for Firestone. Shaw was shocked at the dilapidated state of the speedway and contacted owner Eddie Rickenbacker, only to discover that it was for sale. Shaw then sent out letters to the automobile industry to try to find a buyer. All the responses indicated that the speedway would be turned into a private facility for the buyer. Shaw then looked around for someone to buy the speedway, who would reopen the racetrack as a public venue. He found Terre Haute businessman Tony Hulman. Meetings were set up and the speedway was purchased on November 14, 1945. Though not officially acknowledged, the purchase price for the speedway was reported by the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; and &quot;News&quot; to be $750,000. Major renovations and repairs were made at a quick pace to the frail speedway, in time for the 1946 race. Since the record 42 cars that started the 1933 edition of the 500, the field size has been set at 33 drivers, with only three exceptions to this rule, the first being 1947, when only 30 cars started due to a strike by certain teams affiliated with the ASPAR drivers, owners and sponsors association.

Since then the speedway has continued to grow. Stands have been built and remodeled many times over, suites and museums were added, and many other additions helped bring back Indy&#x27;s reputation as a great track.

===Fabulous roadsters (1950s)===
In the 1950s, cars were topping out at , helping to draw more and more fans. The low-slung, sleek cars were known as roadsters, and the Kurtis, Kuzma, and Watson chassis dominated the field. Nearly all were powered by the Offenhauser, or &quot;Offy&quot;, engines. The crowd favorite Novi, with its unique sound and look, was the most powerful car of the decade that dominated time trials. However, they would never make the full in first place, often breaking down before the end or having to make too many pit stops because of the massive engine&#x27;s thirst for fuel and the weight that went with the extra fuel.

The track&#x27;s reputation improved so much that the 500-mile race became part of the Formula One World Championship for 11 years (1950–1960), even though none of the Indy drivers raced in Formula One and only Ferrari&#x27;s Alberto Ascari of the F1 drivers at the time raced in the 500 in 1952. Five-time world champion Juan Fangio practiced at the speedway in 1958 but ultimately decided against racing there. The 1950s were also the most dangerous era of American racing. Of the 33 drivers to qualify for the 1953 race, nearly half, 16, eventually died in racing accidents.

===Rear-engine revolution (1960s–1990s)===


In October 1961, the final remaining brick sections of the track were paved over with asphalt, with the exception of a distinct three-foot-wide line of bricks at the start-finish line. The &quot;Brickyard&quot; thus became known for its &quot;Yard of Bricks&quot;. After being widely ignored by Formula One drivers when it was an F1 World Championship event, a wave of F1 drivers went to the speedway in the 1960s, and the rear-engine revolution that was started by the Cooper F1 team changed the face of the 500 as well, with and world drivers&#x27; champion Jack Brabham of Australia qualifying his Cooper in 13th for the 1961 race. The Cooper used a smaller (2.7-liter) and less powerful Coventry Climax engine compared to the 4.4-liter Offy engines used by the other 32 cars and was slower on the straights, but many took note of the British car&#x27;s superior handling through the turns. Brabham qualified 17th and after running as high as third, would ultimately finish ninth after completing all 200 laps. Despite this, many doubters claimed the rear-engine cars were for drivers who liked to be pushed around, though as Brabham said &quot;It started the rear-engined revolution at Indy&quot;.

A. J. Foyt, who had won his first 500 in 1961, won the 1964 Indianapolis 500, which was the last ever win for a front-engine car, and since Jim Clark&#x27;s win driving the rear-engine Lotus 38 in 1965, every winner has driven a rear-engine car. Graham Hill won the following year in his first attempt, eventually becoming the only driver to date to achieve auto racing&#x27;s &quot;Triple Crown of Motorsport&quot; of winning the Monaco Grand Prix, Indianapolis 500, and Le Mans 24 Hours. There were enough Americans to compete with them, with A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, and the Unser brothers Bobby and Al leading the charge in the 1960s and 1970s, of whom Foyt and Al Unser would eventually become, respectively, the first two of four drivers, to date, to win four times each, while Bobby Unser won the race three times, with Andretti only ever winning the race once, in 1969. Andretti would go on to race in F1 and win the world championship in with Team Lotus, who had been the first rear-engine winners at Indy, with Clark, in 1965.

From 1970 to 1981, Indianapolis had a twin in the city of Ontario, California, by the name of the Ontario Motor Speedway. This track was known as the &quot;Indianapolis of the West&quot; and the home of the California 500, but was a financial failure due to poor management and not holding enough races on the racetrack.

In the 1977 Indy 500, Janet Guthrie made history when she became the first female driver to qualify for the race. Guthrie started the race from 18th position but retired with timing gear failure after 27 laps. She was eventually classified 29th. 1977 also saw A. J. Foyt make history when he became the first driver to win the race four times.

1979 saw the second exception to the 1934 33-driver field rule. By the late 1970s there arose some resistance from certain car owners and drivers as to the direction being taken by USAC, the auto racing sanctioning body that among other things, governed the Indianapolis 500 event. Some of the dissident teams formed their own racing body, Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). USAC responded by barring six of the most famous teams in the sport from qualification (including Roger Penske and Dan Gurney), for &quot;undermining the well-being of USAC&quot;. The ruling would sideline former Indy winners Bobby Unser, Al Unser Sr., Gordon Johncock, and Johnny Rutherford. After a court injunction in favor of CART, and a controversy where exhaust pipe rules were clarified after qualifications began and certain teams with an altered exhaust pipe were &quot;locked into&quot; the field, USAC held an additional qualification round on the day before the race, announcing that any driver who could post a faster speed than the slowest qualifier (Roger McCluskey) would be allowed to start the race. Bill Vukovich and George Snider were added to the lineup, bringing the field to 35. A crisis was averted for the moment, but USAC&#x27;s handling of both issues was seen as bungling by some people, and as outright manipulation by others, and that year spelled the beginning of the end for USAC&#x27;s governance of the Indy Car series.

The 1980s brought a new generation of speedsters, led by four-time race winner Rick Mears who also broke the speed mark in qualifying (1989) and won six pole positions. Other stars of the decade included Danny Sullivan, Bobby Rahal, and F1 veteran Emerson Fittipaldi. The 1989 race came down to a final ten-lap, a thrilling duel between Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr., culminating in Unser crashing in the third turn of the 199th lap after making contact with Fittpaldi&#x27;s right front tire.

The early 1990s witnessed Arie Luyendyk winning in what was then the fastest 500 to date, with an average speed of . That record was not eclipsed for almost a quarter of a century until Tony Kanaan won the 2013 race with an average speed of over . Rick Mears became the third four-time winner after a late-race duel with Michael Andretti in 1991, and in 1992, Al Unser Jr. eked out a hard-fought victory by defeating last-place-starting driver Scott Goodyear by 0.043 of a second, a margin that is still the closest finish in race history. The 500 got a new look in 1996 when it became an Indy Racing League event, formed as a rival to CART.

There was another qualifying controversy in 1996 and 1997, arising over the IRL&#x27;s &quot;25/8 rule&quot; which locked the previous year&#x27;s top-25 overall points finishers into the Indianapolis race, regardless of their qualifying speed, leaving only eight spots open for entries to qualify on speed alone. The rule effectively locked out the CART series regulars from competing for qualifying spots in the Indy 500. CART responded by holding their own event, the U.S. 500, on the same day as the 1996 Indianapolis 500. While the new qualifying format was not a factor in 1996, it would backfire in 1997 when two drivers who posted qualifying speeds fast enough to make the race were bumped to make room for slower locked-in cars with more 1996-97 championship points. Hemelgarn Racing, who owned the two cars victimized in the scenario, protested to the IRL that the field would not include the 33 fastest cars. After Bump Day was completed, the series elected to add the two bumped cars, driven by Johnny Unser and Lyn St. James, back into the field, bringing the number of starters to 35. This marked the last time the 500&#x27;s starting field has been larger than 33 drivers.

===American open-wheel unification (2000s)===

The early 2000s saw drivers from the rival CART series begin to cross over to compete at the Indianapolis 500. In the 2000 Indianapolis 500, multiple CART champion team Chip Ganassi Racing brought their drivers Juan Pablo Montoya and Jimmy Vasser to Indianapolis. Montoya qualified second, led 167 laps, and won the race convincingly, becoming the seventh Indy 500 rookie to win the race. The next year, Team Penske made its return to the Indianapolis 500 after a five-year absence and was joined by Ganassi, Walker Racing and Michael Andretti, driving for Team Kool Green in a separate effort headed by Kim Green, known as &quot;Team Motorola&quot;. For the second straight year, an Indy rookie won the race as Hélio Castroneves took the checkered flag. Roger Penske then elected to move his entire operation over to the IRL beginning in 2002, taking Castroneves and teammate Gil de Ferran with him. After fielding one car in 2002, Ganassi Racing followed Penske to the IRL full-time for the 2003 season. Michael Andretti, who had left his long-time ride at Newman-Haas Racing because he wanted to run the Indianapolis 500 again (something they were not willing to do), bought a majority interest in CART&#x27;s Team Green, which returned to Indianapolis in 2002 with Dario Franchitti, Paul Tracy and Michael Andretti, and moved it to the IRL that same year as Andretti Green Racing, and in 2004 former CART champion Bobby Rahal&#x27;s operation moved to the IRL as Rahal Letterman Racing. Castroneves repeated his Indianapolis 500 win in 2002 despite controversial circumstances involving a late-race caution and a pass made by Tracy, and his teammate de Ferran won in 2003.

In 2003, the Indy Lights Series, a minor league series to the IndyCar Series, made history with the first May race at the track since 1910, other than the 500. The Freedom 100, first held during the final qualifying weekend, has been moved to &quot;carb day&quot; on the Friday before the 500. From 2005 to 2007, the Indy Lights became the first racing series since 1916 to run at the racecourse twice in one year. The first event being the Freedom 100, held on the oval track as part of the Indianapolis 500 weekend, and the second event, the Liberty Challenge, during the United States Grand Prix weekend, competing on the Grand Prix road course.

Buddy Rice became the first American driver since 1998 to win the race in the rain-shortened 2004 Indianapolis 500. At the time, Rice drove for the team co-owned by 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal and the Indiana native television talk show host and comedian David Letterman. In 2005, Danica Patrick became the first female driver to lead the race at Indianapolis, after acquiring it for a lap near the mark while cycling through pit stops. Dan Wheldon would go on to win the 2005 Indianapolis 500.

Sam Hornish Jr. became the first driver to ever overtake for the lead on the race&#x27;s final lap, ultimately winning the 2006 Indianapolis 500 in the last by a 0.0635-second margin over rookie Marco Andretti. Dario Franchitti became the first native of Scotland since Jim Clark&#x27;s victory in 1965 to win, in the rain-shortened 2007 Indianapolis 500.

In mid-February 2008, Champ Car filed for bankruptcy. In late February, an agreement was reached for Champ Car to be merged with the IRL, and the first IRL IndyCar Series season since the unification took place in 2008. Scott Dixon, driving for Chip Ganassi Racing, became the first native of New Zealand to win, in the 2008 Indianapolis 500.

In the 100th anniversary year of the construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Hélio Castroneves became the sixth three-time winner of the 500 in the 2009 Indianapolis 500. Danica Patrick also had her best finish ever (third place) in the race, also the best finish ever by a woman in the history of the Indianapolis 500.

===Foreign domination (2010s)===

The 2010, 2011 and 2012 runnings of the race saw three consecutive British victories, namely for previous winners Franchitti (2010 and 2012) and the late Wheldon winning in 2011 just a few months before his fatal crash at Las Vegas. Brazilian Tony Kanaan won the 2013 running, before American Ryan Hunter-Reay ended an eight-year streak of foreign winners in 2014.

Previous winner Montoya had returned to IndyCar competition and secured a 2015 win to make himself a two-time winner with a fifteen-year gap between triumphs. The event saw Canadian James Hinchcliffe survive a life-threatening impact in practice. The 2016 race saw another American race winner when rookie Alexander Rossi stretched his fuel mileage to record an upset win in a race where he had been off the leaders&#x27; pace.

The 2017 race saw former Formula One World Champion Fernando Alonso take off from the Monaco Grand Prix to take part in a one-off event, being highly competitive up front before his engine blew. The races&#x27; polesitter and 2008 winner Scott Dixon escaped a huge airborne crash largely unhurt. In spite of heavy crashes, the speedway had now gone more than 20 years without a fatality as the SAFER barriers and the enhanced IndyCars absorbed more of the violent impacts. The race was eventually won by Takuma Sato, who became the first Japanese and Asian winner of the event.

In 2018, Australian former series&#x27; champions Will Power won the race after a decade of participation as the first Australian to win the 500, whereas his Penske teammate Simon Pagenaud repeated that feat, becoming the first French winner of the race since 1920, in 2019 after a last-lap duel with 2016 winner Rossi.

===Start of Penske era (2020s)===
In 2020, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, as with IndyCar Series and other related holdings, was sold to Penske Entertainment Corp., a subsidiary of the Penske Corporation, owned by Roger Penske.

In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indianapolis 500 was not held in late May and instead was held in August. 2017 winner Takuma Sato won the race for the second time after taking lead at lap 186.

In 2021, Brazilian three-time winner Hélio Castroneves won the race after a late-race duel with Álex Palou, he joined A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr. and Rick Mears as four-time winners, this race was also the first victory for Meyer Shank Racing.

In May 2022, IMS announced it had become a Caesars Sportsbook partner beginning with the NTT Indy car series&#x27; GMR Grand Prix on May 14. As part of the deal, the gaming operator opened the Caesars Sportsbook Lounge at the track&#x27;s Pagoda Plaza.

=== Overview of different track layouts ===
Since 2000, various road course layouts have been used for additional races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway:

==Other racing events==

===NASCAR===

From 1919 to 1993, the Indianapolis 500 was the only sanctioned race held at the Speedway. When Tony George (Hulman&#x27;s grandson) inherited the track, he spearheaded an effort to bring more racing events to the track. In August 1994, the Brickyard 400 for the NASCAR Winston Cup Series made its debut, and at the time, featured the largest crowd and largest cash purse in NASCAR history. From 1998 to 2003, an IROC event was held as a support race.

Since 2012, the Cup race has been supported by the Pennzoil 150 of the NASCAR Xfinity Series; in 2020, the race was moved to the infield road course. The Cup race followed suit in 2021 and was renamed the Verizon 200.

Known for a time as Kroger Super Weekend, it also previously hosted the Brickyard Grand Prix for the TUDOR United Sports Car Championship on the infield road course.

===Formula One===

In 1998, Tony George arranged for Formula One to return to the United States for the first time since 1991. A two-year renovation and construction project added an infield road course, new pit garages and a new Pagoda building containing race control and the media center. The road course had been designed internally by IMS in 1992, with the Brickyard golf course redesign taking the future road course into account.

The project culminated in the first United States Grand Prix at the facility in 2000. With over 200,000 spectators in attendance, it was one of the largest crowds in the history of Formula One and considered a huge success. The race was also pivotal to Michael Schumacher&#x27;s winning of the 2000 World Championship, as he came out on top when Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s engine blew, resulting in an eight-point lead of the championship that set Schumacher up to need only one win in the remaining two races, something he achieved at the next event.

The short history of the event, however, was littered with controversies. The 2002 United States Grand Prix was marred by a bizarre ending, in which Michael Schumacher, having already clinched the championship, seemingly tried to stage a dead heat with teammate Rubens Barrichello. The official timings showed Barrichello ahead by 0.011 seconds at the line, leading fans and media to dub the event a farce. The 2002 race was also the first-ever Formula One race to use SAFER barriers. In 2003 Schumacher once more set himself up for the title with an Indianapolis win in a dramatic wet-dry event. The 2005 race turned out to be one of the most controversial races in motorsport history. Michelin realized their tires were ill-equipped for the banking after two heavy crashes for Toyota both for Ralf Schumacher and stand-in Ricardo Zonta, and at the last second, the Michelin teams pulled into the pits at the end of the formation lap, leaving only the three Bridgestone teams (six cars) to contest the race. Fans and media were highly critical of the poor handling of the situation. Many fans walked out, and costly ticket refunds were issued. The 2005 event was not the first tire issue for Michelin at the track, as a blowout caused Ralf Schumacher to crash and fracture his back in the 2004 race, while Fernando Alonso also suffered a tire blowout at the end of the start-finish straight in that same event.

Despite the outrage of the 2005 event, the race returned for two additional years. The race did not enjoy the level of success of its earlier runnings, and attendance and interest fell dramatically. The race was left off the calendar for 2008, and efforts to revive the race for 2009 were not successful. In 2012, the U.S. Grand Prix relocated to the Circuit of the Americas.

===MotoGP===

From 2008 to 2015, the speedway hosted a round of Grand Prix motorcycle racing. The race marked the first motorcycle racing event at the facility since 1909.

Modifications approved by the FIA and FIM were made to the combined road course, bringing the new layout to a total of 16 turns. The motorcycle course was designed to run counter-clockwise, the same direction as the oval events. The banking of oval turn one was bypassed by a new infield section, dubbed the &quot;Snake Pit Complex&quot;. In addition, the double-hairpin after the Hulman Straight was replaced with traditional esses.

On September 12, 2019, the Speedway announced motorcycle racing will return on the FIM-approved circuit with the MotoAmerica Championship of Indianapolis, which will be part of the Motorcycles on Meridian motorcycle festival. The Indianapolis festival will join Sturgis Motorcycle Rally (American Flat Track) and Daytona Beach Bike Week (Daytona 200 American Sportbike Racing Association championship) as hosts of major motorcycle racing events that run with motorcycle festivals. It will mark MotoAmerica&#x27;s first race at the Speedway since 2015, and the first as a stand-alone race with the five major championships participating.

===IndyCar Grand Prix===

Beginning in 2014, the IndyCar Series began holding a race on the combined road course in early May, serving as a lead-in to the Indianapolis 500. The infield road course was modified once again, to make the circuit more competitive, better for fans, and more suited for Indy cars.

===Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational===

The Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational, held in mid-June, is a racing meet for vintage racing, held on the road course. The event is sanctioned by the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association. In addition to multiple classes of racing on the road course, oval track exhibitions featuring historical Indy cars have also been part of the event. The feature event of the weekend is the annual Indy Legends Charity Pro–Am race.

===Indy Autonomous Challenge===
In October 2021 the IMS was the location for the first race with full autonomous race cars as a successor of the DARPA Grand Challenge. University teams from all over the world competed in developing software for high speed autonomous driving on the IMS oval. All teams were using a Dallara Indy Lights vehicle equipped with sensors (lidar, radar, camera) and computation hardware. The teams development a full autonomous driving software stack that enables perception, planning and control on the racetrack. The competition was won by the team &quot;TUM Autonomous Motorsport&quot; from the Technical University of Munich which was awarded prize money of $1 million.

==Brickyard Crossing Golf Course==
From 1960 to 1968, the Speedway Golf Course hosted a PGA Tour event, the 500 Festival Open Invitation; its earlier editions were held during the days surrounding the Indy 500 race week. In 1968, it also held an LPGA tournament, the 500 Ladies Classic in mid-June, won by Mickey Wright. A reconstruction project was completed in 1993, converting the 27-hole layout (18 holes outside, nine in the infield) to an 18-hole championship course designed by legendary golf architect Pete Dye. Renamed &quot;Brickyard Crossing&quot;, it features 14 holes outside, and four holes in the infield, with an infield lake. At par 72, it measures from the back tees with a course rating of 75.1 and a slope of 149.

A senior tour event, the Brickyard Crossing Championship, was played there from 1994 through 2000, and it has also hosted college tournaments. An LPGA event, Indy Women in Tech Championship, debuted in 2017.

==Headquarters==
The opening of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909 dates back close to the birth of the sport of American Championship car racing. Since its inception, the Speedway has been metonymous within the sport. Many Indy car teams, suppliers, and constructors have been and are based in the greater Indianapolis area, some within blocks of the track. When USAC was formed in 1956, the sanctioning body&#x27;s headquarters were constructed nearly across the street. The current sanctioning body, IndyCar, is headquartered in buildings directly across the street.

The track, and occasionally the headquarters, is sometimes referred to as &quot;16th &amp; Georgetown&quot;, owing to the track&#x27;s address at the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, and particularly the administration building&#x27;s physical location at the corner of that intersection (which is now a roundabout).

The Speedway and the city of Indianapolis are closely tied to Indy car racing, analogous to the link NASCAR has to the greater Charlotte area. The term &quot;Indy&quot; and its variations synonymous with motorsports (&quot;Indy 500&quot;, &quot;Indy car&quot;, etc.) derive directly from the shorthand nickname (&quot;Indy&quot;) of the city (&quot;Indianapolis&quot;) itself.

==Weather and climate==

Indianapolis Motor Speedway has a transitional climate with influences of both subtropical and continental. The nearest official weather station is at the Indianapolis International Airport, located just a few miles from the speedway.

Due to the cold winters, including snow on the track, Indy 500 testing is often impossible during winter months. During the main event in late May, the local climate is transitioning from spring to summer. May is the rainiest month of the year, which makes rain delays a large risk during various parts of the event. Ambient temperatures on average for the month is in the lower 70s Fahrenheit/lower 20s Celsius, with temperatures in the 80s not being uncommon later in the month when the race takes place.

For the Brickyard 400 in the summer, the track is much more prone to heatwaves, with the wet season carrying on into July as well.

The defunct Formula One and MotoGP roval infield road course events ran in June/September and August respectively. Since oval racing is not conducted in wet conditions, the inaugural Formula One Grand Prix became the track&#x27;s first race under wet conditions, using the oval&#x27;s Turn 1 in a reverse direction with rain tires. The IndyCar Grand Prix, which is usually run two weeks before the 500, is the main existing road course event and can be run in wet conditions, as can the autumnal race events in September and October, the 6 Hours of Indianapolis for IMSA and the 8 Hours of Indianapolis for the Intercontinental GT Challenge.

<text>Gerard Christopher (born May 11, 1959, in New York City) is an American actor, writer and producer. He was the second actor to play the eponymous role in the television series &quot;Superboy&quot; (from 1989 to 1992), replacing John Haymes Newton, who played the role in season one (1988–1989). During his tenure he would later also be a producer and writer on the series. He has performed in a number of telemovies and was a guest star on daytime soap operas such as &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, and the prime-time soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. He has also starred in the comedy movie &quot;Tomboy&quot; (1985).

Christopher auditioned for the part of Superman / Clark Kent in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; and was chosen by the casting director. When the producers learned he had essentially already played the role, he was dismissed in favor of Dean Cain.

His most recent film role (as of 2003) was &quot;Zack&quot; in the movie &quot;The First of May&quot; (1999). He also appeared as himself on the 2006 television documentary &quot;Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman&quot; talking about his time on &quot;Superboy&quot;.

<text>The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) is a centimeter-wavelength radio astronomy observatory in the southwestern United States built in the 1970s. It lies in central New Mexico on the Plains of San Agustin, between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, approximately west of Socorro. The VLA comprises twenty-eight 25-meter radio telescopes (twenty-seven of which are operational while one is always rotating through maintenance) deployed in a Y-shaped array and all the equipment, instrumentation, and computing power to function as an interferometer. Each of the massive telescopes is mounted on double parallel railroad tracks, so the radius and density of the array can be transformed to adjust the balance between its angular resolution and its surface brightness sensitivity. Astronomers using the VLA have made key observations of black holes and protoplanetary disks around young stars, discovered magnetic filaments and traced complex gas motions at the Milky Way&#x27;s center, probed the Universe&#x27;s cosmological parameters, and provided new knowledge about the physical mechanisms that produce radio emission.

The VLA stands at an elevation of above sea level. It is a component of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). The NRAO is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.

== Characteristics ==
The radio telescope comprises 27 independent antennas in use at a given time plus one spare, each of which has a dish diameter of 25 meters (82 feet) and weighs . The antennas are distributed along the three arms of a track, shaped in a wye (or Y) -configuration, (each of which measures long). Using the rail tracks that follow each of these arms—and that, at one point, intersect with U.S. Route 60 at a level crossing—and a specially designed lifting locomotive (&quot;Hein&#x27;s Trein&quot;), the antennas can be physically relocated to a number of prepared positions, allowing aperture synthesis interferometry with up to 351 independent baselines: in essence, the array acts as a single antenna with a variable diameter. The angular resolution that can be reached is between 0.2 and 0.04 arcseconds.

There are four commonly used configurations, designated A (the largest) through D (the tightest, when all the dishes are within of the center point). The observatory normally cycles through all the various possible configurations (including several hybrids) every 16 months; the antennas are moved every three to four months. Moves to smaller configurations are done in two stages, first shortening the east and west arms and later shortening the north arm. This allows for a short period of improved imaging of extremely northerly or southerly sources.

The frequency coverage is to (400 cm to 0.7 cm).

The Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center (DSOC) for the VLA is located on the campus of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, New Mexico. The DSOC also serves as the control center for the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), a VLBI array of ten 25-meter dishes located from Hawaii in the west to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the east that constitutes the world&#x27;s largest dedicated, full-time astronomical instrument.

==Upgrade and renaming==
In 2011, a decade-long upgrade project resulted in the VLA expanding its technical capacities by factors of up to 8,000. The 1970s-era electronics were replaced with state-of-the-art equipment. To reflect this increased capacity, VLA officials asked for input from both the scientific community and the public in coming up with a new name for the array, and in January 2012 it was announced that the array would be renamed the &quot;Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array&quot;. On March 31, 2012, the VLA was officially renamed in a ceremony inside the Antenna Assembly Building.

=== ngVLA upgrade ===

Upgrade to the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will begin in late 2028 and early science operation will begin in mid 2031. This upgrade will replace the old antennae with more than 260 new antennae. These will be 18 meter in diameter and have three configurations:

* Short baseline array (SBA) is a dense core within about 1 km that includes 19 close-packed antennae with 6 meter diameter. It might be combined with four 18 meter antennae. Located in New Mexico.
* Main Interferometric Array: 214 x 18 meter antennae, reaching a baseline of about 1000 km. The antennae will be arranged in a dense core and spiral arms. Located in New Mexico, west Texas, eastern Arizona, and northern Mexico.
* Long Baseline Array (LBA): An additional 30 antennae with 18 meter diameter of continental scale. Originally stations in Hawaii, Washington, California, Iowa, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and Canada, but now also includes a station in Germany.

The ngVLA will be ten times more sensitive than the old VLA and ten times more sensitive than ALMA. It will operate at 1.2–116 GHz. A prototype antenna was produced by the German company mtex antenna technology. The prototype was planned to be installed in mid 2024.

==Key science==
The VLA is a multi-purpose instrument designed to allow investigations of many astronomical objects, including radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, supernova remnants, gamma-ray bursts, radio-emitting stars, the sun and planets, astrophysical masers, black holes, and the hydrogen gas that constitutes a large portion of the Milky Way galaxy as well as external galaxies. In 1989 the VLA was used to receive radio communications from the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flew by Neptune. A search of the galaxies M31 and M32 was conducted in December 2014 through January 2015 with the intent of quickly searching trillions of systems for extremely powerful signals from advanced civilizations.

It has been used to carry out several large surveys of radio sources, including the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters.

In September 2017 the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS) began. This survey will cover the entire sky visible to the VLA (80% of the Earth&#x27;s sky) in three full scans. Astronomers expect to find about 10 million new objects with the survey — four times more than what is presently known.

==History==
The driving force for the development of the VLA was David S. Heeschen. He is noted as having &quot;sustained and guided the development of the best radio astronomy observatory in the world for sixteen years.&quot; Congressional approval for the VLA project was given in August 1972, and construction began some six months later. The first antenna was put into place in September 1975 and the complex was formally inaugurated in 1980, after a total investment of . It was the largest configuration of radio telescopes in the world.

In 1997 the VLA featured in Contact, the film adaptation of the book by the same name written by Carl Sagan.

With a view to upgrading the venerable 1970s technology with which the VLA was built, the VLA has evolved into the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). The upgrade has enhanced the instrument&#x27;s sensitivity, frequency range, and resolution with the installation of new hardware at the San Agustin site. A second phase of this upgrade may add up to eight additional antennae in other parts of the state of New Mexico, up to away, if funded.

Magdalena Ridge Observatory is a new observatory a few miles south of the VLA, and is run by VLA collaborator New Mexico Tech. Under construction at this site is a ten-element optical interferometer.

In June 2023, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory announced that they will be replacing the ageing antennae with 160 new ones at the site, plus 100 auxiliary antennae located across North America. The project, estimated to cost about $2 billion to build and around $90 million to run, will vastly expand the capabilities of the current installation and increase the frequency sensitivity from 50 GHz to over 100 GHz. The facility will be renamed the &quot;Next Generation Very Large Array&quot;.

== Tourism ==
The VLA is located between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, about west of Socorro, New Mexico. U.S. Route 60 passes east–west through the complex.

The VLA site is open to visitors with paid admission. A visitor center houses a small museum, theater, and a gift shop. A self-guided walking tour is available, as the visitor center is not staffed continuously. Visitors unfamiliar with the area are warned that there is little food on site, or in the sparsely populated surroundings; those unfamiliar with the high desert are warned that the weather is quite variable, and can remain cold into April. For those who cannot travel to the site, the NRAO created a virtual tour of the VLA called the &quot;VLA Explorer&quot;.

The VLA site was previously closed to visitors from March 2020 through October 2022.

<text>Cuthbert &quot;James&quot; Grant (1793 – July 15, 1854) was a Métis leader of the early 19th century who participated in the Pemmican War as an employee of the North West Company.

==Life==
Cuthbert Grant was born in about 1793 at Fort de la Rivière Tremblante, a North West Company trading post located near the present-day town of Togo, Saskatchewan, where his father was a manager. His father was Cuthbert Grant Sr., a North West Company partner, and his mother was Métis. In 1801, at the age of 8, he was sent to be educated, perhaps to Scotland, though this is uncertain. It is not known exactly when he returned to Western Canada, but in 1812, he entered the service of the North West Company at the age of 19. He then travelled with the spring brigade to the &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot;, the &quot;high country&quot; of the northwest.

He was recognized as a leader of the Métis people, and became involved in the bitter struggle between the Nor&#x27;westers and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company stemming from the Pemmican Proclamation, which forbade anyone from exporting pemmican from the Red River Colony. The capture and destruction of the North West Company&#x27;s Fort Gibraltar in 1816, caused further anger at the HBC from the Nor&#x27;westers and the local Métis. This led to the bloody encounter known as the Battle of Seven Oaks, where Robert Semple and 21 colonists from the Red River Colony were killed.

Despite this, when the two rival companies merged in 1821 under the name the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the new governor, Sir George Simpson, requested Grant to head a Métis settlement of some 2,000 people situated some 16 miles west of the Red River Colony on the Assiniboine River. The settlement was to be known as Grantown for many years then was renamed St. François Xavier after the patron saint of the town.

By 1825 wheat was becoming an important food crop and although there were several windmills in operation in the area, Cuthbert Grant was the first to undertake the construction of a watermill. His mill was completed on Sturgeon Creek in 1829. While the exact location is not known, it is probable that it was close to where the Portage Trail crossed the creek; and it is altogether likely that the dam was used as a bridge for crossing the creek during the season of high water. Unfortunately the dam proved unequal to the spring floods and for three successive years it was washed out. Grant finally abandoned the site and moved his machinery to Grantown where he constructed a successful windmill. There is a mill called Grant&#x27;s Old Mill that is located in Winnipeg.

In 1828, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company placed him in charge of the defence of the Red River Colony. He later became a sheriff and magistrate in the District of Assiniboia.

On July 15, 1854, Cuthbert died from injuries sustained after falling from his horse.

== Family and descendants ==

Cuthbert Grant was known to have been married three times, he had at least three sons and six daughters.

His first wife was Elizabeth &quot;Bethsy&quot; McKay, the sister of John Richards McKay and daughter of John McKay and Mary Favell. Grant and Bethsy courted through correspondence; the pair were married on May 22, 1814, at Fort Gibraltar. Their marriage produced one son, James (b. circa 1815). However, while Cuthbert was on trial for his part in Seven Oaks, both Bethsy and their son James disappeared. Their fate is unknown.

In 1820, Cuthbert was involved in a &quot;mariage du pays&quot; with Marie Desmaris. From this union, a daughter Maria was born (b. July 15, 1820). (Maria would later marry Pascal Breland, a magistrate at St. François Xavier.)

Around 1823, Cuthbert married Marie McGillis, the daughter of Angus McGillis and an aboriginal woman named Marguerite. Cuthbert and Marie-Marguerite were the parents of 11 children: Elise, Charles, Pierre, Elizabeth, Marguerite, Cuthbert Louis Marie, Cuthbert, James, Sophia, Caroline, Jessie, and Julie Rose Marie Grant.

Marie survived her husband&#x27;s death by 18 months. She was buried on April 30, 1856, in St.-Francois-Xavier.

Lord Strathspey, the head of Clan Grant, officially declared Cuthbert Grant a member of his clan at a ceremony held in Winnipeg in July 2012. This created a new sept of his descendants in Canada.

==Legacy==
Grant Avenue in Winnipeg and the Cuthbert Grant rose, developed by Agriculture Canada and introduced in 1967, are named in his honour.

During the 1960s, Canadian-born James Bond film producer Harry Saltzman attempted to make a feature film about Grant that would have been shot in Canada. Initially the biographical film was to have starred Sean Connery as Grant.

<text> is a Latin phrase, directly translated as &quot;by the law itself&quot;. It is used as an adverb.

==Usage==
The phrase is used to describe legal consequences that occur by the act of the law itself. For example, if property is held in a tenancy by the entirety by a husband and wife, who then get divorced, the property is converted (i.e. by the law itself) into another form of tenancy, usually a tenancy in common, at the very instant the marriage is dissolved. Likewise, contracts that establish partnerships sometimes provide that the partnership is dissolved if one partner attempts to sell his or her interest in the partnership. In all of these situations, when one legally significant fact occurs, other relationships are automatically changed by the law.

<doc id="227976" wikidata="Q1757487" url="?curid=227976" title="Battle of Seven Oaks">
<text>The Battle of Seven Oaks—also known as the Seven Oaks Massacre and the Seven Oaks Incident—was a violent confrontation of the Pemmican War between the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) and the North West Company (NWC) which occurred on 19 June 1816 near modern-day Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Resulting in a decisive victory for the NWC over their rivals in the North American fur trade, the confrontation was the climax in a long series of dispute in the Canadas.

The battle is also known as the Victory of the Frog Plain () among Métis People, whose members fought for the NWC during the battle. The event would mark one of the first times the Métis asserted themselves as (&#x27;the New Nation&#x27;) and fly the flag of the Métis Nation.

==Background==
For many years, the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers—whose access had previously been controlled by the Assiniboine people—had been a meeting place for the fur trade in British North America (in modern-day Winnipeg, Manitoba). The Forks were also home to Ojibwe newcomers, Cree traders, and Métis buffalo hunters.

In the first decade of the 19th century, the Hudson’s Bay Company established a small depot across the river, at what is now St. Boniface. In 1809, the North West Company arrived to establish Fort Gibraltar at the Forks, which would be built in 1810 by John Wills, Cuthbert Grant’s brother-in-law.

During this time, Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, sought to settle the Red River region, planning to bring Scottish settlers to the Forks and to establish the Red River Colony (also known as the Red River Settlement). In 1812, Selkirk’s men began building Fort Douglas on the west side of the Red River, downstream from the NWC’s Fort Gibraltar.

The Métis saw the Settlement as a threat to their way of life.

Because the project was so poorly planned, the settlers went hungry in 1812 and 1813. They would move south for winter at the junction of the Pembina and Red rivers, relying on the meat provided by the Métis and the NWC, as well as corn purchased from the Peguis Band.

On 8 January 1814, Miles MacDonell, governor of the Red River Colony, issued the Pemmican Proclamation, which prohibited export of pemmican from the colony for the next year.

While Macdonell claimed that the proclamation was meant to guarantee adequate supplies for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Colony, the North West Company and the Métis—who who supplied the NWC with pemmican—viewed it as a ploy by Selkirk to monopolize the commodity, which was important to the NWC. The Métis did not acknowledge the authority of the Red River Settlement, and the Pemmican Proclamation was a blow to both the Métis and North West Company. The NWC accused the HBC of unfairly monopolizing the fur trade.

=== Rising tensions ===
In 1815 through 1816, environmental conditions left pemmican in short supply, and the arrival of the Selkirk settlers only made the shortage worse.

MacDonnell resigned as governor of the Red River Colony in 1815, after several conflicts and suffering from &quot;severe emotional instability.&quot; He was replaced by Robert Semple, an American businessman with no previous experience in the fur trade.

On 7 June 1815, Métis leader and NWC clerk Cuthbert Grant established a Métis camp La Grenouillère (Frog Plain), down the Red River from the HBC’s headquarters at Point Douglas. On June 10, during a shootout between Métis and remaining settlers at HBC’s Fort Douglas, one of Macdonell’s men was killed when a cannon exploded, and three others were wounded.

At this time, Cuthbert gained more men as many of Selkirk’s people went over to the Métis side, as well as the Irish who were initially hired to prepare the way for the settlement, as their contracts expired on June 1. The Métis thereafter increased their demands that the settlers leave the Forks, under order from the four chiefs of the Métis: Grant, William Shaw, Robert Bonhomme Montour, and Peter Bostonais Pangman.

Surveyor and Brandon House district manager Peter Fidler negotiated with the Métis chiefs at their camp at Frog Plain. On 20 June 1815, Pangman instructed Fidler that no colonists were to remain, but that a limited number of HBC servants might stay, as it was to the advantage of the Métis to have competing trading companies in the area.

In March 1816, the HBC seized and then destroyed Fort Gibraltar to prevent the NWC from trans-shipping pemmican from the Forks to their brigades coming in from Fort William on Lake Superior.

==Battle==
On 19 June 1816, Cuthbert Grant led two groups of North West Company employees, a party of about 60 mounted Métis and First Nations freighters, towards Seven Oaks (known to the Métis as &quot;la Grenouillière&quot;, or Frog Plain) to escort a shipment of pemmican to Lake Winnipeg to supply NWC canoe brigades from Montreal which had to pass by en route to Athabasca.

In retaliation for the destruction of Fort Gibraltar, the group stopped a flotilla of HBC canoes coming down the Qu’Appelle River and seized their shipment of stolen pemmican destined for the Red River Colony. Grant’s men escorted their boats of supplies back up the Assiniboine River and seized Brandon House trading post. The horsemen continued towards Lake Winnipeg divided in two groups, one on each side of the Assiniboine River.

HBC employees spotted Grant&#x27;s second group, and HBC Governor Robert Semple and 26-28 men (a group of HBC men and settlers) went out on foot to confront them. Catching up with Grant&#x27;s men at Seven Oaks, Semple challenged them.

The North West Company sent François-Firmin Boucher to speak to Semple&#x27;s men. He and Semple argued, and a gunfight ensued when the settlers tried to arrest Boucher and seize his horse. Early reports said that the Métis fired the first shot and began the fray, but an ensuing investigation by Royal Commissioner William Bachelor Coltman determined with &quot;next to certainty&quot; that it was one of Semple&#x27;s men who fired first.

The Métis were skilled sharpshooters and outnumbered Semple&#x27;s forces by nearly 3 to 1. The Metis killed 21 men, including Governor Semple, while suffering only one fatality. On the Métis side, 16-year-old Joseph Letendre dit Batoche died, and Joseph Trottier was wounded. One of the main assumptions as to why many fewer of Grant&#x27;s men were killed than Semple&#x27;s is because the latter mistakenly thought they had won. After the first round of fire, the Métis threw themselves on their backs to reload their firearms, but the colonists perceived them to be on the ground because they were killed, and began celebrating. Semple’s men were then taken by surprise when the Métis, having reloaded, rose up and resumed firing.

==Aftermath==
According to oral tradition, the Métis gathered that night in their Frog Plain camp to celebrate their victory. There, Métis poet and balladeer Pierre Falcon, Grant’s brother-in-law, wrote “La Chanson de la Grenouillère” about the battle.

Demoralized from the losses, the settlers gathered their belongings the day after the battle and sailed north for Norway House, leaving the Métis in command of the settlement, having seized Fort Douglas.

The battle marked one of the first documented times the Red River Métis declared their nationhood, asserting themselves as (&#x27;the New Nation&#x27;) with rights to trade as they wished and travel freely on their own land. It was also one of the first times that the flag of the Métis Nation was flown.

The British government called for a special inquiry into the incident, and appointed Lieutenant Colonel William Bachelor Coltman as Royal Commissioner, who set his investigation in motion in May 1817. Delivered to the British House of Commons on 24 June 1819, Coltman&#x27;s report exonerated the Métis, concluding that the first shot was fired at François Boucher from Semple’s side. The fighting did not last longer than 15 minutes.

Coltman also concluded that, before the battle, neither side intended to engage in a fight. He also argued that Selkirk and Semple should have known that their enforcement of the Pemmican Proclamation showed &quot;a blameable carelessness as to the consequence, on a subject likely to endanger both the peace of the country and the lives of individuals.&quot;

On 12 August 1816, Selkirk and a force of 90 soldiers who had been discharged from the De Meuron and De Watteville regiments arrived from eastern Canada and captured the North West Company headquarters and supply base at Fort William. Selkirk attempted to prosecute several members of the NWC for murder and kept Boucher in prison for nearly two years without specific charges. The NWC men were tried at York, Upper Canada, in 1818. All trials ended in acquittals, and the remaining charges were dropped. Members of the North West Company counter-sued Selkirk, whose health and influence subsequently declined. Selkirk died in 1820, and the two companies merged in 1821. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company gave Cuthbert Grant an annual salary in 1828 and the position of &quot;warden of the plains of Red River.&quot;

== Commemorations ==
The Manitoba Historical Society erected an obelisk monument in 1891 commemorating the battle at the intersection of Main Street and Rupertsland Boulevard in the Winnipeg district of West Kildonan, the approximate centre of the battle site. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1920.

Parks Canada installed new interpretive signs as part of their reconciliation with the Métis, and the Seven Oaks Park was re-landscaped. The site was officially reopened on 19 June 2016 to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle.

<text>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) or scanning force microscopy (SFM) is a very-high-resolution type of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), with demonstrated resolution on the order of fractions of a nanometer, more than 1000 times better than the optical diffraction limit.

==Overview==

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) gathers information by &quot;feeling&quot; or &quot;touching&quot; the surface with a mechanical probe. Piezoelectric elements that facilitate tiny but accurate and precise movements on (electronic) command enable precise scanning. Despite the name, the Atomic Force Microscope does not use the nuclear force.

===Abilities and spatial resolution===

The AFM has three major abilities: force measurement, topographic imaging, and manipulation.

In force measurement, AFMs can be used to measure the forces between the probe and the sample as a function of their mutual separation. This can be applied to perform force spectroscopy, to measure the mechanical properties of the sample, such as the sample&#x27;s Young&#x27;s modulus, a measure of stiffness.

For imaging, the reaction of the probe to the forces that the sample imposes on it can be used to form an image of the three-dimensional shape (topography) of a sample surface at a high resolution. This is achieved by raster scanning the position of the sample with respect to the tip and recording the height of the probe that corresponds to a constant probe-sample interaction . The surface topography is commonly displayed as a pseudocolor plot.

Although the initial publication about atomic force microscopy by Binnig, Quate and Gerber in 1986 speculated about the possibility of achieving atomic resolution, profound experimental challenges needed to be overcome before atomic resolution of defects and step edges in ambient (liquid) conditions was demonstrated in 1993 by Ohnesorge and Binnig. True atomic resolution of the silicon 7x7 surface had to wait a little longer before it was shown by Giessibl. Subatomic resolution (i.e. the ability to resolve structural details within the electron density of a single atom) has also been achieved by AFM. 

In manipulation, the forces between tip and sample can also be used to change the properties of the sample in a controlled way. Examples of this include atomic manipulation, scanning probe lithography and local stimulation of cells.

Simultaneous with the acquisition of topographical images, other properties of the sample can be measured locally and displayed as an image, often with similarly high resolution. Examples of such properties are mechanical properties like stiffness or adhesion strength and electrical properties such as conductivity or surface potential. In fact, the majority of SPM techniques are extensions of AFM that use this modality.

===Other microscopy technologies===
The major difference between atomic force microscopy and competing technologies such as optical microscopy and electron microscopy is that AFM does not use lenses or beam irradiation. Therefore, it does not suffer from a limitation in spatial resolution due to diffraction and aberration, and preparing a space for guiding the beam (by creating a vacuum) and staining the sample are not necessary.

There are several types of scanning microscopy including SPM (which includes AFM, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and near-field scanning optical microscope (SNOM/NSOM), STED microscopy (STED), and scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical AFM, EC-AFM). Although SNOM and STED use visible, infrared or even terahertz light to illuminate the sample, their resolution is not constrained by the diffraction limit.

===Configuration===
Fig. 3 shows an AFM, which typically consists of the following features. Numbers in parentheses correspond to numbered features in Fig. 3. Coordinate directions are defined by the coordinate system (0).
The small spring-like cantilever (1) is carried by the support (2). Optionally, a piezoelectric element (typically made of a ceramic material) (3) oscillates the cantilever (1). The sharp tip (4) is fixed to the free end of the cantilever (1). The detector (5) records the deflection and motion of the cantilever (1). The sample (6) is mounted on the sample stage (8). An xyz drive (7) permits to displace the sample (6) and the sample stage (8) in x, y, and z directions with respect to the tip apex (4). Although Fig. 3 shows the drive attached to the sample, the drive can also be attached to the tip, or independent drives can be attached to both, since it is the relative displacement of the sample and tip that needs to be controlled. Controllers and plotter are not shown in Fig. 3.

According to the configuration described above, the interaction between tip and sample, which can be an atomic-scale phenomenon, is transduced into changes of the motion of cantilever, which is a macro-scale phenomenon. Several different aspects of the cantilever motion can be used to quantify the interaction between the tip and sample, most commonly the value of the deflection, the amplitude of an imposed oscillation of the cantilever, or the shift in resonance frequency of the cantilever (see section Imaging Modes).

====Detector====
The detector (5) of AFM measures the deflection (displacement with respect to the equilibrium position) of the cantilever and converts it into an electrical signal. The intensity of this signal will be proportional to the displacement of the cantilever.

Various methods of detection can be used, e.g. interferometry, optical levers, the piezoelectric method, and STM-based detectors (see section &quot;AFM cantilever deflection measurement&quot;).

====Image formation====
&quot;This section applies specifically to imaging in . For other imaging modes, the process is similar, except that &quot;deflection&quot; should be replaced by the appropriate feedback variable.&quot;

When using the AFM to image a sample, the tip is brought into contact with the sample, and the sample is raster scanned along an x–y grid. Most commonly, an electronic feedback loop is employed to keep the probe-sample force constant during scanning. This feedback loop has the cantilever deflection as input, and its output controls the distance along the z axis between the probe support (2 in fig. 3) and the sample support (8 in fig 3). As long as the tip remains in contact with the sample, and the sample is scanned in the x–y plane, height variations in the sample will change the deflection of the cantilever. The feedback then adjusts the height of the probe support so that the deflection is restored to a user-defined value (the setpoint). A properly adjusted feedback loop adjusts the support-sample separation continuously during the scanning motion, such that the deflection remains approximately constant. In this situation, the feedback output equals the sample surface topography to within a small error.

Historically, a different operation method has been used, in which the sample-probe support distance is kept constant and not controlled by a feedback (servo mechanism). In this mode, usually referred to as &quot;constant-height mode&quot;, the deflection of the cantilever is recorded as a function of the sample x–y position. As long as the tip is in contact with the sample, the deflection then corresponds to surface topography. This method is now less commonly used because the forces between tip and sample are not controlled, which can lead to forces high enough to damage the tip or the sample. It is, however, common practice to record the deflection even when scanning in constant force mode, with feedback. This reveals the small tracking error of the feedback, and can sometimes reveal features that the feedback was not able to adjust for.

The AFM signals, such as sample height or cantilever deflection, are recorded on a computer during the x–y scan. They are plotted in a pseudocolor image, in which each pixel represents an x–y position on the sample, and the color represents the recorded signal.

===History===
The AFM was invented by IBM scientists in 1985. The precursor to the AFM, the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), was developed by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer in the early 1980s at IBM Research – Zurich, a development that earned them the 1986 Nobel Prize for Physics. Binnig invented the atomic force microscope and the first experimental implementation was made by Binnig, Quate and Gerber in 1986.

The first commercially available atomic force microscope was introduced in 1989. The AFM is one of the foremost tools for imaging, measuring, and manipulating matter at the nanoscale.

===Applications===
The AFM has been applied to problems in a wide range of disciplines of the natural sciences, including solid-state physics, semiconductor science and technology, molecular engineering, polymer chemistry and physics, surface chemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and medicine.

Applications in the field of solid state physics include (a) the identification of atoms at a surface, (b) the evaluation of interactions between a specific atom and its neighboring atoms, and (c) the study of changes in physical properties arising from changes in an atomic arrangement through atomic manipulation.

In molecular biology, AFM can be used to study the structure and mechanical properties of protein complexes and assemblies. For example, AFM has been used to image microtubules and measure their stiffness.

In cellular biology, AFM can be used to attempt to distinguish cancer cells and normal cells based on a hardness of cells, and to evaluate interactions between a specific cell and its neighboring cells in a competitive culture system. AFM can also be used to indent cells, to study how they regulate the stiffness or shape of the cell membrane or wall.

In some variations, electric potentials can also be scanned using conducting cantilevers. In more advanced versions, currents can be passed through the tip to probe the electrical conductivity or transport of the underlying surface, but this is a challenging task with few research groups reporting consistent data (as of 2004).

==Principles==

The AFM consists of a cantilever with a sharp tip (probe) at its end that is used to scan the specimen surface. The cantilever is typically silicon or silicon nitride with a tip radius of curvature on the order of nanometers. When the tip is brought into proximity of a sample surface, forces between the tip and the sample lead to a deflection of the cantilever according to Hooke&#x27;s law. Depending on the situation, forces that are measured in AFM include mechanical contact force, van der Waals forces, capillary forces, chemical bonding, electrostatic forces, magnetic forces (see magnetic force microscope, MFM), Casimir forces, solvation forces, etc. Along with force, additional quantities may simultaneously be measured through the use of specialized types of probes (see scanning thermal microscopy, scanning joule expansion microscopy, photothermal microspectroscopy, etc.).
The AFM can be operated in a number of modes, depending on the application. In general, possible imaging modes are divided into static (also called &quot;contact&quot;) modes and a variety of dynamic (non-contact or &quot;tapping&quot;) modes where the cantilever is vibrated or oscillated at a given frequency.

===Imaging modes===
AFM operation is usually described as one of three modes, according to the nature of the tip motion: contact mode, also called static mode (as opposed to the other two modes, which are called dynamic modes); tapping mode, also called intermittent contact, AC mode, or vibrating mode, or, after the detection mechanism, amplitude modulation AFM; and non-contact mode, or, again after the detection mechanism, frequency modulation AFM.

Despite the nomenclature, repulsive contact can occur or be avoided both in amplitude modulation AFM and frequency modulation AFM, depending on the settings.

====Contact mode====
In contact mode, the tip is &quot;dragged&quot; across the surface of the sample and the contours of the surface are measured either using the deflection of the cantilever directly or, more commonly, using the feedback signal required to keep the cantilever at a constant position. Because the measurement of a static signal is prone to noise and drift, low stiffness cantilevers (i.e. cantilevers with a low spring constant, k) are used to achieve a large enough deflection signal while keeping the interaction force low. Close to the surface of the sample, attractive forces can be quite strong, causing the tip to &quot;snap-in&quot; to the surface. Thus, contact mode AFM is almost always done at a depth where the overall force is repulsive, that is, in firm &quot;contact&quot; with the solid surface.

====Tapping mode====

In ambient conditions, most samples develop a liquid meniscus layer. Because of this, keeping the probe tip close enough to the sample for short-range forces to become detectable while preventing the tip from sticking to the surface presents a major problem for contact mode in ambient conditions. Dynamic contact mode (also called intermittent contact, AC mode or tapping mode) was developed to bypass this problem. Nowadays, tapping mode is the most frequently used AFM mode when operating in ambient conditions or in liquids.

In &quot;tapping mode&quot;, the cantilever is driven to oscillate up and down at or near its resonance frequency. This oscillation is commonly achieved with a small piezo element in the cantilever holder, but other possibilities include an AC magnetic field (with magnetic cantilevers), piezoelectric cantilevers, or periodic heating with a modulated laser beam. The amplitude of this oscillation usually varies from several nm to 200 nm. In tapping mode, the frequency and amplitude of the driving signal are kept constant, leading to a constant amplitude of the cantilever oscillation as long as there is no drift or interaction with the surface. The interaction of forces acting on the cantilever when the tip comes close to the surface, van der Waals forces, dipole–dipole interactions, electrostatic forces, etc. cause the amplitude of the cantilever&#x27;s oscillation to change (usually decrease) as the tip gets closer to the sample. This amplitude is used as the parameter that goes into the electronic servo that controls the height of the cantilever above the sample. The servo adjusts the height to maintain a set cantilever oscillation amplitude as the cantilever is scanned over the sample. A &quot;tapping AFM&quot; image is therefore produced by imaging the force of the intermittent contacts of the tip with the sample surface.

Although the peak forces applied during the contacting part of the oscillation can be much higher than typically used in contact mode, tapping mode generally lessens the damage done to the surface and the tip compared to the amount done in contact mode. This can be explained by the short duration of the applied force, and because the lateral forces between tip and sample are significantly lower in tapping mode over contact mode.
Tapping mode imaging is gentle enough even for the visualization of supported lipid bilayers or adsorbed single polymer molecules (for instance, 0.4 nm thick chains of synthetic polyelectrolytes) under liquid medium. With proper scanning parameters, the conformation of single molecules can remain unchanged for hours, and even single molecular motors can be imaged while moving.

When operating in tapping mode, the phase of the cantilever&#x27;s oscillation with respect to the driving signal can be recorded as well. This signal channel contains information about the energy dissipated by the cantilever in each oscillation cycle. Samples that contain regions of varying stiffness or with different adhesion properties can give a contrast in this channel that is not visible in the topographic image. Extracting the sample&#x27;s material properties in a quantitative manner from phase images, however, is often not feasible.

====Non-contact mode====

In non-contact atomic force microscopy mode, the tip of the cantilever does not contact the sample surface. The cantilever is instead oscillated at either its resonant frequency (frequency modulation) or just above (amplitude modulation) where the amplitude of oscillation is typically a few nanometers (&lt;10 nm) down to a few picometers. The van der Waals forces, which are strongest from 1 nm to 10 nm above the surface, or any other long-range force that extends above the surface acts to decrease the resonance frequency of the cantilever. This decrease in resonant frequency combined with the feedback loop system maintains a constant oscillation amplitude or frequency by adjusting the average tip-to-sample distance. Measuring the tip-to-sample distance at each (x,y) data point allows the scanning software to construct a topographic image of the sample surface.

Non-contact mode AFM does not suffer from tip or sample degradation effects that are sometimes observed after taking numerous scans with contact AFM. This makes non-contact AFM preferable to contact AFM for measuring soft samples, e.g. biological samples and organic thin film. In the case of rigid samples, contact and non-contact images may look the same. However, if a few monolayers of adsorbed fluid are lying on the surface of a rigid sample, the images may look quite different. An AFM operating in contact mode will penetrate the liquid layer to image the underlying surface, whereas in non-contact mode an AFM will oscillate above the adsorbed fluid layer to image both the liquid and surface.

Schemes for dynamic mode operation include frequency modulation where a phase-locked loop is used to track the cantilever&#x27;s resonance frequency and the more common amplitude modulation with a servo loop in place to keep the cantilever excitation to a defined amplitude. In frequency modulation, changes in the oscillation frequency provide information about tip-sample interactions. Frequency can be measured with very high sensitivity and thus the frequency modulation mode allows for the use of very stiff cantilevers. Stiff cantilevers provide stability very close to the surface and, as a result, this technique was the first AFM technique to provide true atomic resolution in ultra-high vacuum conditions.

In amplitude modulation, changes in the oscillation amplitude or phase provide the feedback signal for imaging. In amplitude modulation, changes in the phase of oscillation can be used to discriminate between different types of materials on the surface. Amplitude modulation can be operated either in the non-contact or in the intermittent contact regime. In dynamic contact mode, the cantilever is oscillated such that the separation distance between the cantilever tip and the sample surface is modulated.

Amplitude modulation has also been used in the non-contact regime to image with atomic resolution by using very stiff cantilevers and small amplitudes in an ultra-high vacuum environment.

==Topographic image==
Image formation is a plotting method that produces a color mapping through changing the x–y position of the tip while scanning and recording the measured variable, i.e. the intensity of control signal, to each x–y coordinate. The color mapping shows the measured value corresponding to each coordinate. The image expresses the intensity of a value as a hue. Usually, the correspondence between the intensity of a value and a hue is shown as a color scale in the explanatory notes accompanying the image.

Operation mode of image forming of the AFM are generally classified into two groups from the viewpoint of whether or not it uses z-Feedback loop (not shown) to maintain the tip-sample distance to keep signal intensity exported by the detector. The first one (using z-Feedback loop), said to be &quot;constant XX mode&quot; (XX is something which kept by z-Feedback loop).

Topographic image formation mode is based on abovementioned &quot;constant XX mode&quot;, z-Feedback loop controls the relative distance between the probe and the sample through outputting control signals to keep constant one of frequency, vibration and phase which typically corresponds to the motion of cantilever (for instance, voltage is applied to the Z-piezoelectric element and it moves the sample up and down towards the Z direction.

===Topographic image of FM-AFM===
When the distance between the probe and the sample is brought to the range where atomic force may be detected, while a cantilever is excited in its natural eigenfrequency (&quot;f&quot;0), the resonance frequency &quot;f&quot; of the cantilever may shift from its original resonance frequency. In other words, in the range where atomic force may be detected, a frequency shift (&quot;df&quot; =&quot;f&quot;–&quot;f&quot;0) will also be observed. When the distance between the probe and the sample is in the non-contact region, the frequency shift increases in negative direction as the distance between the probe and the sample gets smaller.

When the sample has concavity and convexity, the distance between the tip-apex and the sample varies in accordance with the concavity and convexity accompanied with a scan of the sample along x–y direction (without height regulation in z-direction). As a result, the frequency shift arises. The image in which the values of the frequency obtained by a raster scan along the x–y direction of the sample surface are plotted against the x–y coordination of each measurement point is called a constant-height image.

On the other hand, the df may be kept constant by moving the probe upward and downward (See (3) of FIG.5) in z-direction using a negative feedback (by using z-feedback loop) while the raster scan of the sample surface along the x–y direction. The image in which the amounts of the negative feedback (the moving distance of the probe upward and downward in z-direction) are plotted against the x–y coordination of each measurement point is a topographic image. In other words, the topographic image is a trace of the tip of the probe regulated so that the df is constant and it may also be considered to be a plot of a constant-height surface of the df.

Therefore, the topographic image of the AFM is not the exact surface morphology itself, but actually the image influenced by the bond-order between the probe and the sample, however, the topographic image of the AFM is considered to reflect the geographical shape of the surface more than the topographic image of a scanning tunnel microscope.

==Force spectroscopy==
Besides imaging, AFM can be used for force spectroscopy, the direct measurement of tip-sample interaction forces as a function of the gap between the tip and sample. The result of this measurement is called a force-distance curve. For this method, the AFM tip is extended towards and retracted from the surface as the deflection of the cantilever is monitored as a function of piezoelectric displacement. These measurements have been used to measure nanoscale contacts, atomic bonding, Van der Waals forces, and Casimir forces, dissolution forces in liquids and single molecule stretching and rupture forces. AFM has also been used to measure, in an aqueous environment, the dispersion force due to polymer adsorbed on the substrate. Forces of the order of a few piconewtons can now be routinely measured with a vertical distance resolution of better than 0.1 nanometers. Force spectroscopy can be performed with either static or dynamic modes. In dynamic modes, information about the cantilever vibration is monitored in addition to the static deflection.

Problems with the technique include no direct measurement of the tip-sample separation and the common need for low-stiffness cantilevers, which tend to &quot;snap&quot; to the surface. These problems are not insurmountable. An AFM that directly measures the tip-sample separation has been developed. The snap-in can be reduced by measuring in liquids or by using stiffer cantilevers, but in the latter case a more sensitive deflection sensor is needed. By applying a small dither to the tip, the stiffness (force gradient) of the bond can be measured as well.

===Biological applications and other===
Force spectroscopy is used in biophysics to measure the mechanical properties of living material (such as tissue or cells) or detect structures of different stiffness buried into the bulk of the sample using the stiffness tomography. Another application was to measure the interaction forces between from one hand a material stuck on the tip of the cantilever, and from another hand the surface of particles either free or occupied by the same material. From the adhesion force distribution curve, a mean value of the forces has been derived. It allowed to make a cartography of the surface of the particles, covered or not by the material. AFM has also been used for mechanically unfolding proteins. In such experiments, the analyzes of the mean unfolding forces with the appropriate model leads to the obtainment of the information about the unfolding rate and free energy profile parameters of the protein.

==Identification of individual surface atoms==
The AFM can be used to image atoms and structures on a variety of surfaces. The atom at the apex of the tip &quot;senses&quot; individual atoms on the underlying surface when it begins the formation of chemical bonds with each atom. Because these chemical interactions subtly alter the tip&#x27;s vibration frequency, they can be detected and mapped. This principle was used to distinguish between atoms of silicon, tin and lead on an alloy surface, by comparing these atomic fingerprints with values obtained from density functional theory (DFT) simulations.

Interaction forces must be measured precisely for each type of atom expected in the sample, and then to compare with forces given by DFT simulations. It was found that the tip interacted most strongly with silicon atoms, and interacted 24% and 41% less strongly with tin and lead atoms, respectively. Each different type of atom could be identified in the matrix as the tip using this information.

==Probe==
An AFM probe has a sharp tip on the free-swinging end of a cantilever that protrudes from a holder. The dimensions of the cantilever are in the scale of micrometers. The radius of the tip is usually on the scale of a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers. (Specialized probes exist with much larger end radii, for example probes for indentation of soft materials.) The cantilever holder, also called the holder chip—often 1.6 mm by 3.4 mm in size—allows the operator to hold the AFM cantilever/probe assembly with tweezers and fit it into the corresponding holder clips on the scanning head of the atomic force microscope.

This device is most commonly called an &quot;AFM probe&quot;, but other names include &quot;AFM tip&quot; and &quot;cantilever&quot; (employing the name of a single part as the name of the whole device). An AFM probe is a particular type of SPM probe.

AFM probes are manufactured with MEMS technology. Most AFM probes used are made from silicon (Si), but borosilicate glass and silicon nitride are also in use. AFM probes are considered consumables as they are often replaced when the tip apex becomes dull or contaminated or when the cantilever is broken. They can cost from a couple of tens of dollars up to hundreds of dollars per cantilever for the most specialized cantilever/probe combinations.

To use the device, the tip is brought very close to the surface of the object under investigation, and the cantilever is deflected by the interaction between the tip and the surface, which is what the AFM is designed to measure. A spatial map of the interaction can be made by measuring the deflection at many points on a 2D surface.

Several types of interaction can be detected. Depending on the interaction under investigation, the surface of the tip of the AFM probe needs to be modified with a coating. Among the coatings used are gold – for covalent bonding of biological molecules and the detection of their interaction with a surface, diamond for increased wear resistance and magnetic coatings for detecting the magnetic properties of the investigated surface. Another solution exists to achieve high resolution magnetic imaging: equipping the probe with a microSQUID. The AFM tips are fabricated using silicon micro machining and the precise positioning of the microSQUID loop is achieved using electron beam lithography. The additional attachment of a quantum dot to the tip apex of a conductive probe enables surface potential imaging with high lateral resolution, scanning quantum dot microscopy.

The surface of the cantilevers can also be modified. These coatings are mostly applied in order to increase the reflectance of the cantilever and to improve the deflection signal.

==Forces as a function of tip geometry==
The forces between the tip and the sample strongly depend on the geometry of the tip. Various studies were exploited in the past years to write the forces as a function of the tip parameters.

Among the different forces between the tip and the sample, the water meniscus forces are highly interesting, both in air and liquid environment. Other forces must be considered, like the Coulomb force, van der Waals forces, double layer interactions, solvation forces, hydration and hydrophobic forces.

===Water meniscus===
Water meniscus forces are highly interesting for AFM measurements in air. Due to the ambient humidity, a thin layer of water is formed between the tip and the sample during air measurements. The resulting capillary force gives rise to a strong attractive force that pulls the tip onto the surface. In fact, the adhesion force measured between tip and sample in ambient air of finite humidity is usually dominated by capillary forces. As a consequence, it is difficult to pull the tip away from the surface. For soft samples including many polymers and in particular biological materials, the strong adhesive capillary force gives rise to sample degradation and destruction upon imaging in contact mode. Historically, these problems were an important motivation for the development of dynamic imaging in air (e.g. &quot;tapping mode&quot;). During tapping mode imaging in air, capillary bridges still form. Yet, for suitable imaging conditions, the capillary bridges are formed and broken in every oscillation cycle of the cantilever normal to the surface, as can be inferred from an analysis of cantilever amplitude and phase vs. distance curves. As a consequence, destructive shear forces are largely reduced and soft samples can be investigated.

In order to quantify the equilibrium capillary force, it is necessary to start from the Laplace equation for pressure:

:formula_1

where &quot;γ&quot;L, is the surface energy and &quot;r&quot;0 and &quot;r&quot;1 are defined in the figure.

The pressure is applied on an area of

:formula_2

where &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between the tip&#x27;s surface and the liquid&#x27;s surface while &quot;h&quot; is the height difference between the surrounding liquid and the top of the miniscus.

The force that pulls together the two surfaces is

:formula_3

The same formula could also be calculated as a function of relative humidity.

Gao calculated formulas for different tip geometries. As an example, the force decreases by 20% for a conical tip with respect to a spherical tip.

When these forces are calculated, a difference must be made between the wet on dry situation and the wet on wet situation.

For a spherical tip, the force is:

:formula_4 for dry on wet,

:formula_5for wet on wet,

where &quot;θ&quot; is the contact angle of the dry sphere and &quot;φ&quot; is the immersed angle, as shown in the figure

For a conical tip, the formula becomes:

:formula_6 for dry on wet

:formula_7 for wet on wet

where &quot;δ&quot; is the half cone angle and &quot;r&quot;0 and &quot;h&quot; are parameters of the meniscus profile.

==AFM cantilever-deflection measurement==

===Beam-deflection measurement===

The most common method for cantilever-deflection measurements is the beam-deflection method. In this method, laser light from a solid-state diode is reflected off the back of the cantilever and collected by a position-sensitive detector (PSD) consisting of two closely spaced photodiodes, whose output signal is collected by a differential amplifier.
Angular displacement of the cantilever results in one photodiode collecting more light than the other photodiode, producing an output signal (the difference between the photodiode signals normalized by their sum), which is proportional to the deflection of the cantilever. The sensitivity of the beam-deflection method is very high, and a noise floor on the order of 10 fm Hz− can be obtained routinely in a well-designed system. Although this method is sometimes called the &quot;optical lever&quot; method, the signal is not amplified if the beam path is made longer. A longer beam path increases the motion of the reflected spot on the photodiodes, but also widens the spot by the same amount due to diffraction, so that the same amount of optical power is moved from one photodiode to the other. The &quot;optical leverage&quot; (output signal of the detector divided by deflection of the cantilever) is inversely proportional to the numerical aperture of the beam focusing optics, as long as the focused laser spot is small enough to fall completely on the cantilever. It is also inversely proportional to the length of the cantilever.

The relative popularity of the beam-deflection method can be explained by its high sensitivity and simple operation, and by the fact that cantilevers do not require electrical contacts or other special treatments, and can therefore be fabricated relatively cheaply with sharp integrated tips.

===Other deflection-measurement methods===
Many other methods for beam-deflection measurements exist. 
* &quot;Piezoelectric detection&quot; – Cantilevers made from quartz (such as the qPlus configuration), or other piezoelectric materials can directly detect deflection as an electrical signal. Cantilever oscillations down to 10pm have been detected with this method.
* &quot;Laser Doppler vibrometry&quot; – A laser Doppler vibrometer can be used to produce very accurate deflection measurements for an oscillating cantilever (thus is only used in non-contact mode). This method is expensive and is only used by relatively few groups.
* &quot;Scanning tunneling microscope&quot; (STM) — The first atomic microscope used an STM complete with its own feedback mechanism to measure deflection. This method is very difficult to implement, and is slow to react to deflection changes compared to modern methods.
* &quot;Optical interferometry&quot; – Optical interferometry can be used to measure cantilever deflection. Due to the nanometre scale deflections measured in AFM, the interferometer is running in the sub-fringe regime, thus, any drift in laser power or wavelength has strong effects on the measurement. For these reasons optical interferometer measurements must be done with great care (for example using index matching fluids between optical fibre junctions), with very stable lasers. For these reasons optical interferometry is rarely used.
* &quot;Capacitive detection&quot; – Metal coated cantilevers can form a capacitor with another contact located behind the cantilever. Deflection changes the distance between the contacts and can be measured as a change in capacitance.
* &quot;Piezoresistive detection&quot; – Cantilevers can be fabricated with piezoresistive elements that act as a strain gauge. Using a Wheatstone bridge, strain in the AFM cantilever due to deflection can be measured. This is not commonly used in vacuum applications, as the piezoresistive detection dissipates energy from the system affecting Q of the resonance.

==Piezoelectric scanners==
AFM scanners are made from piezoelectric material, which expands and contracts proportionally to an applied voltage. Whether they elongate or contract depends upon the polarity of the voltage applied. Traditionally the tip or sample is mounted on a &quot;tripod&quot; of three piezo crystals, with each responsible for scanning in the &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; directions. In 1986, the same year as the AFM was invented, a new piezoelectric scanner, the tube scanner, was developed for use in STM. Later tube scanners were incorporated into AFMs. The tube scanner can move the sample in the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; directions using a single tube piezo with a single interior contact and four external contacts. An advantage of the tube scanner compared to the original tripod design, is better vibrational isolation, resulting from the higher resonant frequency of the single element construction, in combination with a low resonant frequency isolation stage. A disadvantage is that the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; motion can cause unwanted &quot;z&quot; motion resulting in distortion. Another popular design for AFM scanners is the flexure stage, which uses separate piezos for each axis, and couples them through a flexure mechanism.

Scanners are characterized by their sensitivity, which is the ratio of piezo movement to piezo voltage, i.e., by how much the piezo material extends or contracts per applied volt. Due to the differences in material or size, the sensitivity varies from scanner to scanner. Sensitivity varies non-linearly with respect to scan size. Piezo scanners exhibit more sensitivity at the end than at the beginning of a scan. This causes the forward and reverse scans to behave differently and display hysteresis between the two scan directions. This can be corrected by applying a non-linear voltage to the piezo electrodes to cause linear scanner movement and calibrating the scanner accordingly. One disadvantage of this approach is that it requires re-calibration because the precise non-linear voltage needed to correct non-linear movement will change as the piezo ages (see below). This problem can be circumvented by adding a linear sensor to the sample stage or piezo stage to detect the true movement of the piezo. Deviations from ideal movement can be detected by the sensor and corrections applied to the piezo drive signal to correct for non-linear piezo movement. This design is known as a &quot;closed loop&quot; AFM. Non-sensored piezo AFMs are referred to as &quot;open loop&quot; AFMs.

The sensitivity of piezoelectric materials decreases exponentially with time. This causes most of the change in sensitivity to occur in the initial stages of the scanner&#x27;s life. Piezoelectric scanners are run for approximately 48 hours before they are shipped from the factory so that they are past the point where they may have large changes in sensitivity. As the scanner ages, the sensitivity will change less with time and the scanner would seldom require recalibration, though various manufacturer manuals recommend monthly to semi-monthly calibration of open loop AFMs.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
AFM has several advantages over the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Unlike the electron microscope, which provides a two-dimensional projection or a two-dimensional image of a sample, the AFM provides a three-dimensional surface profile. In addition, samples viewed by AFM do not require any special treatments (such as metal/carbon coatings) that would irreversibly change or damage the sample, and does not typically suffer from charging artifacts in the final image. While an electron microscope needs an expensive vacuum environment for proper operation, most AFM modes can work perfectly well in ambient air or even a liquid environment. This makes it possible to study biological macromolecules and even living organisms. In principle, AFM can provide higher resolution than SEM. It has been shown to give true atomic resolution in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and, more recently, in liquid environments. High resolution AFM is comparable in resolution to scanning tunneling microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. AFM can also be combined with a variety of optical microscopy and spectroscopy techniques such as fluorescent microscopy of infrared spectroscopy, giving rise to scanning near-field optical microscopy, nano-FTIR and further expanding its applicability. Combined AFM-optical instruments have been applied primarily in the biological sciences but have recently attracted strong interest in photovoltaics and energy-storage research, polymer sciences, nanotechnology and even medical research.

===Disadvantages===
A disadvantage of AFM compared with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) is the single scan image size. In one pass, the SEM can image an area on the order of square millimeters with a depth of field on the order of millimeters, whereas the AFM can only image a maximum scanning area of about 150×150 micrometers and a maximum height on the order of 10–20 micrometers. One method of improving the scanned area size for AFM is by using parallel probes in a fashion similar to that of millipede data storage.

The scanning speed of an AFM is also a limitation. Traditionally, an AFM cannot scan images as fast as an SEM, requiring several minutes for a typical scan, while an SEM is capable of scanning at near real-time, although at relatively low quality. The relatively slow rate of scanning during AFM imaging often leads to thermal drift in the image making the AFM less suited for measuring accurate distances between topographical features on the image. However, several fast-acting designs were suggested to increase microscope scanning productivity including what is being termed videoAFM (reasonable quality images are being obtained with videoAFM at video rate: faster than the average SEM). To eliminate image distortions induced by thermal drift, several methods have been introduced.

AFM images can also be affected by nonlinearity, hysteresis, and creep of the piezoelectric material and cross-talk between the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; axes that may require software enhancement and filtering. Such filtering could &quot;flatten&quot; out real topographical features. However, newer AFMs utilize real-time correction software (for example, feature-oriented scanning) or closed-loop scanners, which practically eliminate these problems. Some AFMs also use separated orthogonal scanners (as opposed to a single tube), which also serve to eliminate part of the cross-talk problems.

As with any other imaging technique, there is the possibility of image artifacts, which could be induced by an unsuitable tip, a poor operating environment, or even by the sample itself, as depicted on the right. These image artifacts are unavoidable; however, their occurrence and effect on results can be reduced through various methods.
Artifacts resulting from a too-coarse tip can be caused for example by inappropriate handling or de facto collisions with the sample by either scanning too fast or having an unreasonably rough surface, causing actual wearing of the tip.

Due to the nature of AFM probes, they cannot normally measure steep walls or overhangs. Specially made cantilevers and AFMs can be used to modulate the probe sideways as well as up and down (as with dynamic contact and non-contact modes) to measure sidewalls, at the cost of more expensive cantilevers, lower lateral resolution and additional artifacts.

==Other applications in various fields of study==

The latest efforts in integrating nanotechnology and biological research have been successful and show much promise for the future, including in fields such as nanobiomechanics. Since nanoparticles are a potential vehicle of drug delivery, the biological responses of cells to these nanoparticles are continuously being explored to optimize their efficacy and how their design could be improved. Pyrgiotakis et al. were able to study the interaction between CeO2 and Fe2O3 engineered nanoparticles and cells by attaching the engineered nanoparticles to the AFM tip. Studies have taken advantage of AFM to obtain further information on the behavior of live cells in biological media. Real-time atomic force spectroscopy (or nanoscopy) and dynamic atomic force spectroscopy have been used to study live cells and membrane proteins and their dynamic behavior at high resolution, on the nanoscale. Imaging and obtaining information on the topography and the properties of the cells has also given insight into chemical processes and mechanisms that occur through cell-cell interaction and interactions with other signaling molecules (ex. ligands). Evans and Calderwood used single cell force microscopy to study cell adhesion forces, bond kinetics/dynamic bond strength and its role in chemical processes such as cell signaling. 
Scheuring, Lévy, and Rigaud reviewed studies in which AFM to explore the crystal structure of membrane proteins of photosynthetic bacteria.
Alsteen et al. have used AFM-based nanoscopy to perform a real-time analysis of the interaction between live mycobacteria and antimycobacterial drugs (specifically isoniazid, ethionamide, ethambutol, and streptomycine), which serves as an example of the more in-depth analysis of pathogen-drug interactions that can be done through AFM.

<text>The Davis Cup is the premier international team event in men&#x27;s tennis. It is organised by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and contested annually between teams from over 150 competing countries, making it the world&#x27;s largest annual team sporting competition. It is described by the organisers as the &quot;World Cup of Tennis&quot; and the winners are referred to as the world champions. The competition began in 1900 as a challenge between Great Britain and the United States. By 2023 155 nations entered teams into the competition.

The most successful country over the history of the competition is the United States (winning 32 titles and finishing as runners-up 29 times). The most recent champions are Italy, who beat Netherlands to win their third title (and second consecutive one) in 2024.

The women&#x27;s equivalent of the Davis Cup is the Billie Jean King Cup, formerly known as the Federation Cup (1963–1995) and Fed Cup (1995–2020). Australia, Italy, Russia, the Czech Republic and the United States are the only countries to have won both Davis Cup and Federation/Fed/Billie Jean King Cup titles in the same year.

The Davis Cup allowed only amateurs and national registered professional players (from 1968) to compete until 1973, five years after the start of the Open Era.

==History==

The idea for an event pitting the best British and Americans in competition against one another was probably first conceived by James Dwight, the first president of the U.S. National Lawn Tennis Association when it formed in 1881. Desperate to assess the development of American players against the renowned British champions, he worked tirelessly to engage British officials in a properly sanctioned match, but failed to do so. He nevertheless tried to entice top international (particularly British) talent to the U.S. and sanctioned semi-official tours of the top American players to Great Britain. Diplomatic relations between Great Britain and the United States on the tennis front had strengthened such that, by the mid-1890s, reciprocal tours were staged annually between players of the two nations, and an ensuing friendship between American William Larned and Irishman Harold Mahony spurred efforts to formalize an official team competition between the two nations.

International competitions had been staged for some time before the first Davis Cup match in 1900. From 1892, England and Ireland had been competing in an annual national-team-based competition, similar to what would become the standard Davis Cup format, mixing single and doubles matches, and in 1895 England played against France in a national team competition. During Larned&#x27;s tour of the British Isles in 1896, where he competed in several tournaments including the Wimbledon Championships, he was also a spectator for the annual England vs. Ireland match.

He returned to exclaim that Britain had agreed to send a group of three to the U.S. the following summer, which would represent the first British lawn tennis &quot;team&quot; to compete in the U.S. Coincidentally, some weeks before Larned left for his British tour, the idea for an international competition was discussed also between leading figures in American lawn tennis—one of whom was tennis journalist E.P. Fischer—at a tournament in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.
Dwight F. Davis was in attendance at this tournament, and was thought to have got wind of the idea as it was discussed in the tournament&#x27;s popular magazine, and Davis&#x27;s name was mentioned as someone who might &#x27;do something for the game ... put up some big prize, or cup&#x27;. Larned and Fischer met on several occasions that summer and discussed the idea of an international match to be held in Chicago the following summer, pitting six of the best British players against six of the best Americans, in a mixture of singles and doubles matches. This was discussed openly in two articles in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, but did not come to fruition.

Nevertheless, the following summer, Great Britain—though not under the official auspices of the Lawn Tennis Association—sent three of its best players to compete in several US tournaments. Their relative poor performances convinced Dwight and other leading officials and figures in American lawn tennis that the time was right for a properly sanctioned international competition. This was to be staged in Newcastle in July 1898, but the event never took place as the Americans could not field a sufficiently strong team. A reciprocal tour to the U.S. in 1899 amounted to just a single British player travelling overseas, as many of the players were involved in overseas armed conflicts.

It was at this juncture, in the summer of 1899, that four members of the Harvard University tennis team—Dwight Davis included—travelled across the States to challenge the best west-coast talent, and upon his return, it apparently occurred to Davis that if teams representing regions could arouse such great feelings, then why wouldn&#x27;t a tennis event that pitted national teams in competition be just as successful. He approached James Dwight with the idea, which was tentatively agreed, and he ordered an appropriate sterling silver punchbowl trophy from Shreve, Crump &amp; Low, purchasing it from his own funds for about US$1,000. They in turn commissioned a classically styled design from William B. Durgin&#x27;s of Concord, New Hampshire, crafted by the Englishman Rowland Rhodes.

Beyond donating a trophy for the competition, Davis&#x27;s involvement in the incipient development of the team competition that came to bear his name was negligible, yet a persistent myth has emerged that Davis devised both the idea for an international tennis competition and its format of mixing singles and doubles matches. Research has shown this to be a myth, similar in its exaggeration of a single individual&#x27;s efforts within a highly complex long-term development to the myths of William Webb Ellis and Abner Doubleday, who have both been wrongly credited with inventing rugby and baseball, respectively. Davis nevertheless went on to become a prominent politician in the United States in the 1920s, serving as US Secretary of War from 1925 to 1929 and as Governor-General of the Philippines from 1929 to 1932.

The first match, between the United States and Britain (competing as the &quot;British Isles&quot;), was held at the Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts in 1900. The American team, of which Dwight Davis was captain, surprised the British by winning the first three matches. The following year the two countries did not compete, but the US won the match in 1902 and Britain won the following four matches. By 1905 the event expanded to include Belgium, Austria, France, and Australasia, a combined team from Australia and New Zealand that competed together until 1914.
The competition was initially titled the &quot;International Lawn Tennis Challenge&quot; although it soon became known as the &quot;Davis Cup&quot;, after Dwight Davis&#x27; trophy. The Davis Cup competition was initially played as a challenge cup. All teams competed against one another for the right to face the previous year&#x27;s champion in the final round.

Beginning in 1923, the world&#x27;s teams were split into two zones: the &quot;America Zone&quot; and the &quot;Europe Zone&quot;. The winners of the two zones met in the &quot;Inter-Zonal Zone&quot; (&quot;INZ&quot;) to decide which national team would challenge the defending champion for the cup. In 1955 a third zone, the &quot;Eastern Zone&quot;, was added. Because there were three zones, the winner of one of the three zones received a bye in the first round of the INZ challenger rounds. In 1966, the &quot;Europe Zone&quot; was split into two zones, &quot;Europe Zone A&quot; and &quot;Europe Zone B&quot;, so the winners of the four zones competed in the INZ challenger rounds.
From 1950 to 1967, Australia dominated the competition, winning the Cup 15 times in 18 years.

Beginning in 1972, the format was changed to a knockout competition, so that the defending champion was required to compete in all rounds, and the Davis Cup was awarded to the champion.

Up until 1973, the Davis Cup had only ever been won by the United States, Great Britain/British Isles, France and Australia/Australasia. Their domination was eventually broken in 1974 when South Africa and India made the final; however, the final was scratched and South Africa was awarded the cup after India refused to travel to South Africa in protest of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies. The following year saw the first actual final between two &quot;outsider&quot; nations, when Sweden beat Czechoslovakia 3–2, and since then, many other countries have gone on to capture the trophy.

All contract professionals were not allowed to play in the Davis Cup until 1973. The tennis stars who turned professional prior to the Open Era (pre-1968) were not allowed to compete in the Davis Cup despite the fact that the Grand Slam tournaments and most tennis tournaments became Open Era events in 1968. From 1968 national registered professionals were allowed to compete under the control of their national tennis associations. In 1973 Australian players like Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall were allowed to play in the Davis Cup for the first time since 1962 (for Laver) and since 1956 (for Rosewall).

In 1981, a tiered system of competition was created, in which the 16 best national teams compete in the &quot;World Group&quot; and all other national teams compete in one of four groups in one of three regional zones. In 1989, the tiebreak was introduced into Davis Cup competition, and from 2016 it is used in all five sets.

In 2018, the ITF voted to change the format of the competition from 2019 onwards, changing it to an 18-team event to happen at the end of the season, with 71% of ITF member federations voting in favour of the change. The new format, backed by footballer Gerard Piqué and Japanese businessman Hiroshi Mikitani, was likened to a world cup of tennis and was designed to be more attractive to sponsors and broadcasters. Opposing federations included those from Australia, Germany, and Great Britain. Support for the reform was also mixed among current and former players, with some such as Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal being in favour of the new format, but others such as Rod Laver, Lucas Pouille and Roger Federer being opposed. On 12 January 2023, the ITF announced that the partnership with the new promoter ends and that ITF is taking back the control of the event.

Davis Cup games have been affected by political protests several times, especially in Sweden:
* The match between Sweden and Rhodesia 1968 was supposed to be played in Båstad but was moved to Bandol, France, due to protests against the Rhodesian white minority government of Ian Smith.
* The Swedish government tried to stop the match between Chile and Sweden in 1975 in Båstad, due to violations of human rights in Chile. The match was played, even while 7,000 people protested against it outside.
* After the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, 6,000 people protested against Israel outside the Malmö city Davis Cup match between Sweden and Israel in March 2009. The Malmö Municipality politicians were concerned about extremists, and decided due to security reasons to only let a small audience in.

Russia and Belarus were suspended after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Format==
===Competition===
The 18 best national teams are assigned to the World Group and compete annually for the Davis Cup. Nations which are not in the World Group compete in one of three regional zones (Americas, Asia/Oceania, and Europe/Africa). The competition is spread over four weekends during the year. Each elimination round between competing nations is held in one of the countries, and is played as the best of five matches (4 singles, 1 doubles). The ITF determines the host countries for all possible matchups before each year&#x27;s tournament.

The World Group is the top group and includes the world&#x27;s best 18 national teams. Teams in the World Group play a four-round elimination event. Teams are seeded based on a ranking system released by the ITF, taking into account previous years&#x27; results. The defending champion and runner-up are always the top two seeds in the event. The losers of the first-round matches are sent to the World Group playoff round, where they play along with winners from Group I of the regional zones. The playoff round winners play in the World Group for the next year&#x27;s competition, while the losers play in Group I of their respective regional zone.

Each of the three regional zones is divided into four groups. Groups I and II play elimination rounds, with the losing teams facing relegation to the next-lower group. The teams in Groups III and those in Group IV play a round-robin event with promotion and relegation.

===2019 modifications===
For the 2019 edition, the format of the cup is changed. The main modification is the World Group taking place at one location and in one week, with eighteen teams divided in six round-robin groups of three teams each, with the winners of the groups and the two best second places advancing to quarterfinals. The series between the teams in this stage will feature two singles matches and one doubles match, instead of the best-of-5 series, with the matches changing from best of 5 sets to best of 3. As the World Group will now take place as one single competition, this event has been named as the Davis Cup Finals. The lower zone groups I and II will be composed of single ties deciding promotion or relegation.

=== Structure ===
Note: The total number of nations in Group One is 24. However, the distribution among the three zones may vary each year, according to the number of nations promoted or relegated between Group One and the World Group. The number of nations in the World Group and Group One together is 22 from Euro/Africa Zone, 9 from Americas Zone and 9 from Asia/Oceania Zone.

===Ties and rubbers===
As in other cup competitions &quot;tie&quot; is used in the Davis Cup to mean an elimination round. In the Davis Cup, the word &quot;rubber&quot; means an individual match.

In the annual World Group competition, 16 nations compete in eight first-round ties; the eight winners compete in four quarterfinal ties; the four winners compete in two semifinal ties; and the two winners compete in the final tie.

Each tie consists of five rubbers, which are played in three days (usually on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). The winner of the tie is the nation which wins three or more of the five rubbers in the tie. On the first day, the first two rubbers are singles, which are generally played by each nation&#x27;s two best available singles players. On the second day, the doubles rubber is played. On the third day, the final two rubbers are typically &quot;reverse singles&quot;, in which the first-day contestants usually play again, but they swap opponents from the first day&#x27;s singles rubbers. However, in certain circumstances, the team captain may replace one or two of the players who played the singles on Friday by other players who were nominated for the tie. For example, if the tie has already been decided in favour of one of the teams, it is common for younger or lower-ranked team members to play the remaining &quot;dead rubbers&quot; in order for them to gain Davis Cup experience.

Since 2011, if a nation has a winning 3–1 lead after the first reverse single match and that match has gone to four sets or more, then the remaining reverse single match which is a dead rubber is not played. All five rubbers are played if one nation has a winning 3–0 lead after the doubles match.

Ties are played at a venue chosen by one of the competing countries. The right of choice is given on an alternating basis. Therefore, countries play in the country where the last tie between the teams was not held. In case the two countries have not met since 1970, lots are drawn to determine the host country.

Venues in the World Group must comply with certain minimum standards, including a minimum seating capacity as follows:
* World Group play-offs: 4,000
* World Group first round: 4,000
* World Group quarterfinals: 6,000
* World Group semifinals: 8,000
* World Group final: 12,000

===Captain===
Prior to each tie, the captain (non-playing coach appointed by the national association) nominates a squad of four players and decides who will compete in the tie. On the day before play starts, the order of play for the first day is drawn at random. In the past, teams could substitute final day singles players only in case of injury or illness, verified by a doctor, but current rules permit the captain to designate any player to play the last two singles rubbers, provided that no first day matchup is repeated. There is no restriction on which of the playing team members may play the doubles rubber: the two singles players, two other players (usually doubles specialists) or a combination.

Each rubber is normally played as best of five sets. Since 2016, all sets use a tiebreak at 6–6 if necessary (formerly, the fifth set usually had no tiebreaker, so play continued until one side won by two games e.g. 10–8). However, if a team has clinched the tie before all five rubbers have been completed, the remaining rubbers may be shortened to best of three sets, with a tiebreak if necessary to decide all three sets.

In Group III and Group IV competitions, each tie consists only of three rubbers, which include two singles and one doubles rubber, which is played in a single day. The rubbers are in the best of three sets format, with a tie breaker if necessary to decide all three sets.

<text>Systems thinking is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts. It has been used as a way of exploring and developing effective action in complex contexts, enabling systems change. Systems thinking draws on and contributes to systems theory and the system sciences. 

==History==
===Ptolemaic system versus the Copernican system===
The term &quot;system&quot; is polysemic: Robert Hooke (1674) used it in multiple senses, in his System of the World, but also in the sense of the Ptolemaic system versus the Copernican system of the relation of the planets to the fixed stars which are cataloged in Hipparchus&#x27; and Ptolemy&#x27;s Star catalog. Hooke&#x27;s claim was answered in magisterial detail by Newton&#x27;s (1687) &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, Book three, &quot;The System of the World&quot; (that is, &quot;the system of the world&quot; is a physical system).

Newton&#x27;s approach, using dynamical systems continues to this day. In brief, Newton&#x27;s equations (a system of equations) have methods for their solution.

===Feedback control systems===

By 1824 the Carnot cycle presented an engineering challenge, which was how to maintain the operating temperatures of the hot and cold working fluids of the physical plant. In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell presented a framework for, and a limited solution to the problem of controlling the rotational speed of a physical plant. Maxwell&#x27;s solution echoed James Watt&#x27;s (1784) centrifugal moderator (denoted as element Q) for maintaining (but not enforcing) the constant speed of a physical plant (that is, &quot;Q&quot; represents a moderator, but not a governor, by Maxwell&#x27;s definition).

Maxwell&#x27;s approach, which linearized the equations of motion of the system, produced a tractable method of solution. Norbert Wiener identified this approach as an influence on his studies of cybernetics during World War II and Wiener even proposed treating some subsystems under investigation as black boxes. Methods for solutions of the systems of equations then become the subject of study, as in feedback control systems, in stability theory, in constraint satisfaction problems, the unification algorithm, type inference, and so forth.

===Applications===
:&quot;So, how do we change the structure of systems to produce more of what we want and less of that which is undesirable? ... MIT’s Jay Forrester likes to say that the average manager can ... guess with great accuracy where to look for leverage points—places in the system where a small change could lead to a large shift in behavior&quot;.— Donella Meadows, (2008) &quot;Thinking In Systems: A Primer&quot; p.145 

==Characteristics==


*Subsystems serve as part of a larger system, but each comprises a system in its own right. Each frequently can be described reductively, with properties obeying its own laws, such as Newton&#x27;s System of the World, in which entire planets, stars, and their satellites can be treated, sometimes in a scientific way as dynamical systems, entirely mathematically, as demonstrated by Johannes Kepler&#x27;s equation (1619) for the orbit of Mars before Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; appeared in 1687.
*Black boxes are subsystems whose operation can be characterized by their inputs and outputs, without regard to further detail.

===Particular systems===
*Political systems were recognized as early as the millennia before the common era.
*Biological systems were recognized in Aristotle&#x27;s lagoon ca. 350 BCE.
*Economic systems were recognized by 1776.
*Social systems were recognized by the 19th and 20th centuries of the common era.
**Radar systems were developed in World War II in subsystem fashion; they were made up of transmitter, receiver, power supply, and signal processing subsystems, to defend against airborne attacks.
*Dynamical systems of ordinary differential equations were shown to exhibit stable behavior given a suitable Lyapunov control function by Aleksandr Lyapunov in 1892.
*Thermodynamic systems were treated as early as the eighteenth century, in which it was discovered that heat could be created without limit, but that for closed systems, laws of thermodynamics could be formulated. Ilya Prigogine (1980) has identified situations in which systems far from equilibrium can exhibit stable behavior; once a Lyapunov function has been identified, future and past can be distinguished, and scientific activity can begin.

===Systems far from equilibrium===
 Living systems are resilient, and are far from equilibrium. Homeostasis is the analog to equilibrium, for a living system; the concept was described in 1849, and the term was coined in 1926.

 Resilient systems are self-organizing; 

 The scope of functional controls is hierarchical, in a resilient system.

==Frameworks and methodologies==
Frameworks and methodologies for systems thinking include:
* Critical systems heuristics: in particular, there can be twelve boundary categories for the systems when organizing one&#x27;s thinking and actions.
* Critical systems thinking, including the E P I C approach.
* Ontology engineering of representation, formal naming and definition of categories, and the properties and the relations between concepts, data, and entities.
* Soft systems methodology, including the CATWOE approach and rich pictures.
* Systemic design, for example using the double diamond approach.
* System dynamics of stocks, flows, and internal feedback loops.
* Viable system model: uses 5 subsystems.

<text>Inform is a programming language and design system for interactive fiction originally created in 1993 by Graham Nelson. Inform can generate programs designed for the Z-code or Glulx virtual machines. Versions 1 through 5 were released between 1993 and 1996. Around 1996, Nelson rewrote Inform from first principles to create version 6 (or Inform 6). Over the following decade, version 6 became reasonably stable and a popular language for writing interactive fiction. In 2006, Nelson released Inform 7 (briefly known as Natural Inform), a completely new language based on principles of natural language and a new set of tools based around a book-publishing metaphor.

== Z-Machine and Glulx ==

The Inform compilers translate Inform code to story files for Glulx or Z-code, two virtual machines designed specifically for interactive fiction. Glulx, which can support larger games, is the default.

The Z-machine was originally developed by Infocom in 1979 for their interactive fiction titles. Because there is at least one such interpreter for nearly every major and minor platform, this means that the same Z-code file can be run on a multitude of platforms with no alterations. Originally Inform targeted the Z-machine only.

Andrew Plotkin created an unofficial version of Inform 6 that was also capable of generating files for Glulx, a virtual machine he had designed to overcome many of the limitations of the several-decades-old Z-machine. Starting with Inform 6.3, released February 29, 2004, Inform 6 has included official support for both virtual machines, based on Andrew Plotkin&#x27;s work. Early release of Inform 7 did not support Glulx, but in August 2006 Glulx support was released.

== Inform 6 ==

Inform was originally created by Graham Nelson in 1993. In 1996 Nelson rewrote Inform from first principles to create version 6 (or Inform 6). Over the following decade, version 6 became reasonably stable and a popular language for writing interactive fiction.

The Inform 6 system consists of two major components: the Inform compiler, which generates story files from Inform source code, and the Inform library, a suite of software which handles most of the difficult work of parsing the player&#x27;s text input and keeping track of the world model. The name Inform also refers to the Inform programming language that the compiler understands.

Although Inform 6 and the Z-Machine were originally designed with interactive fiction in mind, many other programs have been developed, including a BASIC interpreter, a LISP tutorial (complete with interpreter), a Tetris game, and a version of the game Snake.

=== The Inform 6 compiler ===

The Inform compiler generates files for the Z-machine or Glulx (also called story files) from Inform 6 source code.

=== The Inform 6 programming language ===

The Inform programming language is object-oriented and procedural. A key element of the language is objects. Objects are maintained in an object tree which lists the parent–child relationships between objects. Since the parent–child relationship is often used to represent location, an object which is the parent of another object is often said to &quot;hold&quot; it. Objects can be moved throughout the tree. Typically, top level objects represent rooms and other locations within the game, which may hold objects representing the room&#x27;s contents, be they physical items, non-player characters, the player&#x27;s character, or background effects. All objects can hold other objects, so a codice_1 object might hold an codice_2 object which is holding a codice_3 object which contains the codice_4 object.

In early versions of Inform, objects were different from the notion of objects from object-oriented programming, in that there was no such thing as a class. Later versions added support for class definitions and allowed objects to be members of classes. Objects and classes can inherit from multiple classes. Interactive fiction games typically contain many unique objects. Because of this, many objects in Inform do not inherit from any class, other than the &quot;metaclass&quot; Object. However, objects very frequently have attributes (boolean properties, such as codice_5 or codice_6) that are recognized by the Inform library. In other languages this would normally be implemented via inheritance.

Here is a simple example of Inform 6 source code.

! Square brackets define a routine. This is the Main routine, which takes no arguments.
[ Main;
 print &quot;Hello, World!^&quot;;


The procedual parts, statements and operators, are largely borrowed from C, with the notable exception that instead of is used to take array subscripts. Routines are defined in square brackets, as in the routine above, but called with round brackets as in C. The character is used to escape characters and to invoke raw Z-machine opcodes.

=== Inform 6 library ===

The Inform system also contains the Inform library, which automates nearly all the most difficult work involved in programming interactive fiction; specifically, it includes a text parser that makes sense of the player&#x27;s input, and a world model that keeps track of such things as objects (and their properties), rooms, doors, the player&#x27;s inventory, etc.

The Inform compiler does not require the use of the Inform library. There are several replacement libraries available, such as Platypus and InformATE, a library that codes Inform in Spanish. Some games may use no library at all, such as a direct port of Zork into Inform 6.

=== Example game ===

Here is an example of Inform 6 source code that makes use of the Inform library. The Inform 6 code sample below is usable in Inform 7, but not without special demarcation indicating that it is embedded legacy code.

=== Notable games developed in Inform 6 or earlier versions ===
* &quot;Curses&quot;, by Graham Nelson (1993), the first game ever written in the Inform programming language. Considered one of the first &quot;modern&quot; games to meet the high standards set by Infocom&#x27;s best titles.
* &quot;&quot; (1997), written by Marc Blank &amp; Michael Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Given away free by Activision to promote the release of &quot;&quot;.
* &quot;Anchorhead&quot;, by Michael S. Gentry (1998) is a highly rated horror story inspired by H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos.
* &quot;Photopia&quot;, by Adam Cadre (1998), the first almost entirely puzzle-free game. Won the annual Interactive Fiction Competition in 1998.
* &quot;Varicella&quot; by Adam Cadre (1999). It won four XYZZY Awards in 1999 including the XYZZY Award for Best Game, and had a scholarly essay written about it.
* &quot;Galatea&quot;, by Emily Short (2000). Galatea is focused entirely on interaction with the animated statue of the same name. Galatea has one of the most complex interaction systems for a non-player character in an interactive fiction game. Adam Cadre called Galatea &quot;the best NPC ever&quot;.
* &quot;Slouching Towards Bedlam&quot;, by Star C. Foster and Daniel Ravipinto (2003). Set in a steampunk setting, the game narratively integrates meta-game functionality (saving, restoring, restarting) into the game world itself. The game won two XYZZY Awards and received the highest average score of any game in the Interactive Fiction Competition as of 2006.

== Inform 7 ==

On April 30, 2006, Graham Nelson announced the beta release of Inform 7 to the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup. Inform 7 consists of three primary parts: The Inform 7 IDE with development tools specialized for testing interactive fiction, the Inform 7 compiler for the new language, and &quot;The Standard Rules&quot; which form the core library for Inform 7. Inform 7 also relies on the Inform library and Inform compiler from Inform 6. The compiler compiles the Inform 7 source code into Inform 6 source code, which is then compiled separately by Inform 6 to generate a Glulx or Z-code story file. Inform 7 also defaults to writing Blorb files, archives which include the Z-code together with optional &quot;cover art&quot; and metadata intended for indexing purposes. The full set of Inform 7 tools are currently available for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux (since 2007).

, Inform 7 and its and tools remain under development. Since April 2022, Inform 7 is open source and developed on GitHub.

Inform 7 was named Natural Inform for a brief period of time, but was later renamed Inform 7. This old name is why the Inform 7 compiler is named &quot;NI&quot;.

=== Inform 7 IDE ===


Inform 7 comes with an integrated development environment (IDE) for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux. The Mac OS X IDE was developed by Andrew Hunter. The Microsoft Windows IDE was developed by David Kinder. The Linux IDE (known as GNOME Inform) was developed by Philip Chimento.

The Inform 7 IDE includes a text editor for editing Inform 7 source code. Like many other programming editors it features syntax highlighting. It marks quoted strings in one color. Headings of organizational sections (Volumes, Books, Chapters, Parts, and Sections) are bolded and made larger. Comments are set in a different color and made slightly smaller.

The IDE includes a built-in Z-code interpreter. The Mac OS X IDE&#x27;s interpreter is based on the Zoom interpreter by Andrew Hunter, with contributions from Jesse McGrew. The Microsoft Windows IDE&#x27;s interpreter is based on WinFrotz.

As a developer tests the game in the built-in interpreter, progress is tracked in the &quot;skein&quot; and &quot;transcript&quot; views of the IDE. The skein tracks player commands as a tree of branching possibilities. Any branch of the tree can be quickly re-followed, making it possible to retry different paths in a game under development without replaying the same portions of the game. Paths can also be annotated with notes and marked as solutions, which can be exported as text walkthroughs. The transcript, on the other hand, tracks both player commands and the game&#x27;s responses. Correct responses from the game can be marked as &quot;blessed&quot;. On replaying a transcript or a branch of the skein, variations from the blessed version will be highlighted, which can help the developer find errors.

The IDE also provides various indices into the program under development. The code is shown as a class hierarchy, a traditional IF map, a book-like table of contents, and in other forms. Clicking items in the index jumps to the relevant source code.

The IDE presents two side-by-side panes for working in. Each pane can contain the source code being worked on, the current status of compilation, the skein, the transcript, the indices of the source code, a running version of the game, documentation for Inform 7 or any installed extensions to it, or settings. The concept is to imitate an author&#x27;s manuscript book by presenting two &quot;facing pages&quot; instead of a multitude of separate windows.

=== Inform 7 programming language ===

Notable features include strong bias towards declarative rule-based style of programming and ability to infer types and properties of objects from the way they are used. For example, the statement &quot;John wears a hat.&quot; creates a &quot;person&quot; called &quot;John&quot; (since only people are capable of wearing things), creates a &quot;thing&quot; with the &quot;wearable&quot; property (since only objects marked &quot;wearable&quot; are capable of being worn), and sets John as wearing the hat.

Another notable aspect of the language is direct support for relations which track associations between objects. This includes automatically provided relations, like one object containing another or an object being worn, but the developer can add their own relations. A developer might add relations indicating love or hatred between beings, or to track which characters in a game have met each other.

Inform 7 is a highly domain-specific programming language, providing the writer/programmer with a much higher level of abstraction than Inform 6, and highly readable resulting source code. General-purpose logical and arithmetic statements are written in natural language (see e.g. the &quot;Physics&quot; example in &quot;The Inform Recipe Book&quot;).

In early Inform 7, the compiler translates the code to Inform 6, much like CFront did with C++ and C. The current compiler (as of version 10 of 2022) is additionally able to translate the code directly to C for a native executable, and to generate an &quot;index mini-website&quot; describing the story.

=== Example game ===

Statements in Inform 7 take the form of complete sentences. Blank lines and indentation are in some places structurally significant. The basic form of an Inform 7 program is as follows:
&quot;Hello, World!&quot; by &quot;I.F. Author&quot;

The world is a room.

When play begins, say &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
The following is a reimplementation of the above &quot;Hello Deductible&quot; example written in Inform 7. It relies on the library known as &quot;The Standard Rules&quot; which are automatically included in all Inform 7 compilations.
&quot;Hello Deductible&quot; by &quot;I.F. Author&quot;

The story headline is &quot;An Interactive Example&quot;.

The Living Room is a room. &quot;A comfortably furnished living room.&quot;
The Kitchen is north of the Living Room.
The Front Door is south of the Living Room.
The Front Door is a door. The Front Door is closed and locked.

The insurance salesman is a man in the Living Room. The description is &quot;An insurance salesman in a tacky polyester suit. He seems eager to speak to you.&quot; Understand &quot;man&quot; as the insurance salesman.

A briefcase is carried by the insurance salesman. The description is &quot;A slightly worn, black briefcase.&quot; Understand &quot;case&quot; as the briefcase.

The insurance paperwork is in the briefcase. The description is &quot;Page after page of small legalese.&quot; Understand &quot;papers&quot; or &quot;documents&quot; or &quot;forms&quot; as the paperwork.

Instead of listening to the insurance salesman: 
 say &quot;The salesman bores you with a discussion of life insurance policies. From his briefcase he pulls some paperwork which he hands to you.&quot;;
 move the insurance paperwork to the player.
=== Notable games written in Inform 7 ===

&quot;Mystery House Possessed&quot; (2005), by Emily Short, was the first Inform 7 game released to be public. It was released as part of the &quot;Mystery House Taken Over&quot; project.

On March 1, 2006, Short announced the release of three further games:
&quot;Bronze&quot; (an example of a traditional puzzle-intensive game) and &quot;Damnatio Memoriae&quot; (a follow-up to her award-winning Inform 6 game &quot;Savoir-Faire&quot;) were joined by Graham Nelson&#x27;s &quot;The Reliques of Tolti-Aph&quot; (2006). When the Inform 7 public beta was announced on April 30, 2006, six &quot;worked examples&quot; of medium to large scale works were made available along with their source code, including the three games previously released on March 1.

Emily Short&#x27;s &quot;Floatpoint&quot; was the first Inform 7 game to take first place in the Interactive Fiction Competition.
It also won 2006 XYZZY Awards for Best Setting and Best NPCs. &quot;Rendition&quot;, by nespresso (2007), is a political art experiment in the form of a text adventure game. Its approach to tragedy has been discussed academically by both the Association for Computing Machinery and Cambridge University.

<text>Text Adventure Development System (TADS) is a prototype-based domain-specific programming language and set of standard libraries for creating interactive fiction (IF) games.

==History==
The original TADS 1 was released by High Energy Software as shareware in 1988, and was followed by TADS 2 not long after. From the late 1980s to early 1990s, free development tools such as TADS and Inform enabled amateur communities to create interactive fiction. In the mid-1990s, TADS was a top development tool for interactive fiction. At the time, it was a more improved tool for parsing and world building than existing systems like AGT (Adventure Game Toolkit).

TADS 2 syntax is based on C, with bits of Pascal. TADS 2 has been maintained and updated at regular intervals by its creator, Michael J. Roberts, even after it became freeware in July 1996. Graham Nelson, creator of Inform, describes Inform and TADS as the &quot;only two systems... widely used&quot; in the last half of the 1990s, and TADS has been called &quot;The second most commonly used IF programming language today&quot;. Multimedia TADS, introduced in 1998, allows games to display graphics, animation and play sounds, if the platform supports it.

In 2006, TADS received a major overhaul with the release of TADS 3, which is a complete rewrite of the TADS engine, only retaining the platform-dependent code to ease porting. TADS 3 uses a language with a syntax that resembles C++ and Java. It has many new features, such as efficient dynamic objects (with automatic garbage collection), structured exceptions, native UTF-8 strings, and many useful function classes.

The TADS 3 compiler and interpreter have been ported to the DOS, Macintosh and Unix platforms. Several TADS 3 games have been released.

==TADS games==
Games written in TADS are compiled to a platform-independent format that can be played on any computer for which a suitable virtual machine (VM) exists. Such virtual machines exist for several platforms, and in this respect, TADS closely follows the example of the original Infocom Z-machine, as well as modern languages such as Java and C#.

Whereas the TADS 1 and 2 VMs had to parse the commands entered by the player, before sending the results on to the game, TADS 3 employs a more general-purpose virtual machine, where the command-parsing is done by the game code itself, akin to Inform. The rationale for this is that it is easier to customize the parser.

===Notable games developed in TADS 2===
* &quot;Uncle Zebulon&#x27;s Will&quot;, by Magnus Olsson (1995). It won the TADS category at the inaugural 1995 Interactive Fiction Competition and was included on Activision&#x27;s 1996 commercial release of &quot;Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom&quot;.
* &quot;The Frenetic Five vs. Sturm und Drang&quot;, the first game in the &quot;Frenetic Five&quot; series by Neil deMause (1997). The game won a XYZZY Award for Best NPCs that year.
* &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; by Suzanne Britton (1999). Winner of XYZZY Award for Best Story and finalist in seven other XYZZY Award categories in 1999, the game features a huge amount of detailed worldbuilding.
* &quot;Kaged&quot; by Ian Finley (2000). Winner of the 2000 annual Interactive Fiction Competition.
* &quot;1893: A World&#x27;s Fair Mystery&quot; by Peter Nepstad (2002). The game is one of a handful to be released commercially in recent years, garnering attention from the New York Times and the Associated Press. It also won the 2002 XYZZY Award for Best Setting.

===Notable games developed in TADS 3===
* &quot;Max Blaster and Doris de Lightning Against the Parrot Creatures of Venus&quot; by Dan Shiovitz and Emily Short (2003). Winner of the 2003 Spring Thing; a somewhat unusual example of multiple player characters (or PCs).
* &quot;The Elysium Enigma&quot; by Eric Eve (2006). Eve was awarded XYZZY Award for Best Game, XYZZY Award for Best Individual NPC, and took third place in the 2006 annual Interactive Fiction Competition.

<doc id="227998" wikidata="Q1430172" url="?curid=227998" title="Organizational learning">
<text>Organizational learning is the process of creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge within an organization. An organization improves over time as it gains experience. From this experience, it is able to create knowledge. This knowledge is broad, covering any topic that could better an organization. Examples may include ways to increase production efficiency or to develop beneficial investor relations. Knowledge is created at four different units: individual, group, organizational, and inter organizational.

The most common way to measure organizational learning is a learning curve. Learning curves are a relationship showing how as an organization produces more of a product or service, it increases its productivity, efficiency, reliability and/or quality of production with diminishing returns. Learning curves vary due to organizational learning rates. Organizational learning rates are affected by individual proficiency, improvements in an organization&#x27;s technology, and improvements in the structures, routines and methods of coordination.

== Relevance ==
Organizational learning happens as a function of experience within an organization and allows the organization to stay competitive in an ever-changing environment. Organizational learning is a process improvement that can increase efficiency, accuracy, and profits. A real-world example of organizational learning is how a new pizza store will reduce the cost per pizza as the cumulative production of pizzas increases. As the staff creates more pizza; they begin to make pizzas faster, the staff learns how to work together, and the equipment is placed in the most efficient location leading to cheaper costs of creation. An example of a more formal way to track and support organizational learning is a learning agenda.

Organizational learning is an aspect of organizations and a subfield of organizational studies. As an aspect of an organization, organizational learning is the process of creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge. Knowledge creation, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer can be seen as adaptive processes that are functions of experience. Experience is the knowledge that contributes to the procedural understanding of a subject through involvement or exposure. Research within organizational learning specifically applies to the attributes and behavior of this knowledge and how it can produce changes in the cognition, routines, and behaviors of an organization and its individuals.

Individuals are predominantly seen as the functional mechanisms for organizational learning by creating knowledge through experience. However, individuals&#x27; knowledge only facilitates learning within the organization as a whole if it is transferred. Individuals may withhold their knowledge or exit the organization. Knowledge that is embedded into the organization, in addition to its individuals, can be retained. Organizations can retain knowledge in other ways than just retaining individuals, including using knowledge repositories such as communication tools, processes, learning agendas, routines, networks, and transactive memory systems.

As a subfield, organizational learning is the study of experience, knowledge, and the effects of knowledge within an organizational context. The study of organizational learning directly contributes to the applied science of knowledge management (KM) and the concept of the learning organization. Organizational learning is related to the studies of organizational theory, organizational communication, organizational behavior, organizational psychology, and organizational development. Organizational learning has received contributions from the fields of educational psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, political science, and management science.

=== Communities of learning ===
Organizations gain knowledge in one of the four organizational communities of learning: individual, team, organizational, and inter-organizational. Organizational learning &quot;involves the process through which organizational communities (e.g. groups, departments, divisions) change as a result of experience.&quot; An example of organizational learning is a hospital surgical team learning to use new technology that will increase efficiency.
* &quot;Individual learning&quot; is the smallest community at which learning can occur. An individual learns new skills or ideas, and their productivity at work may increase as they gain expertise. The individual can decide whether or not to share their knowledge with the rest of the group. If the individual leaves the group and doesn&#x27;t share their knowledge before leaving, the group loses this knowledge. In their study of software development, Boh, Slaughter and Espinosa (2007) found that individuals were more productive the more specialized experience they had with a certain system.
* &quot;Group learning&quot; is the next largest community There are conflicting definitions of group learning among researchers studying it. One belief is that group learning is a process in which a group takes action, gets feedback, and uses this feedback to modify their future action. Another belief is that group learning happens when a member shares their individual knowledge with other group members. Others have suggested that group learning is primarily a process of error detection and correction or that group learning is primarily about the processes of interpretation and integration. Once this happens, individual learning turns into group learning. Reagans, Argote, and Brooks (2005) studied group learning by examining joint-replacement surgery in teaching hospitals. They concluded that &quot;increased experience working together in a team promoted better coordination and teamwork.&quot; Working together in a team also allowed members to share their knowledge with others and learn from other members. To sum up the different definitions cover following aspects: task independence (what one group member does affects and is affected by another group member); social psychological awareness (members perceive themselves as a group and are perceived as a group); and social embeddedness (the group exists in a larger social system).

* &quot;Organizational learning&quot; is the way in which an organization creates and organizes knowledge relating to their functions and culture. Organizational learning happens in all of the organization&#x27;s activities, and it happens in different speeds. The goal of organizational learning is to successfully adapt to changing environments, to adjust under uncertain conditions, and to increase efficiency. According to Argote (1993), managers in manufacturing plants saw organization learning occur when they found ways to make individual workers more proficient, improve the organization&#x27;s &quot;technology, tooling, and layout,&quot; improve the organization&#x27;s structure, and determine the organization&#x27;s strengths.
* &quot;Interorganizational learning&quot; is the way in which different organizations in an alliance collaborate, share knowledge, and learn from one another. An organization is able to improve its &quot;processes and products by integrating new insights and knowledge&quot; from another organization. By learning from another organization, an organization is able to cut time costs, decrease the risks associated with problem solving, and learn faster. Learning from another organization can mean either applying the same ideas used by that organization or modifying these ideas, thereby creating innovation. Inter-organizational learning occurs frequently in fixed business models, such as franchising. The franchisee looking to use the franchisor&#x27;s brand has to learn how to use the organization&#x27;s business model before starting a franchise.

=== History of study ===
The origin of the focused study of organizational learning can be traced to the late 1970s, when researchers studied it from a psychological viewpoint. Key advances in the field include:
* &quot;Behavioral psychology and organizational development&quot;: In their 1978 work on organizational learning, Chris Argyris and Donald Schön developed the concepts of single-loop and double-loop learning. Single-loop learning is the process in which a mistake is corrected by using a different strategy or method that is expected to yield a different, successful outcome. Take, for example, a person who acts a certain way to accomplish a certain goal. If this person&#x27;s actions fail in accomplishing the goal, with single-loop learning, this person will reflect on their previous actions and, going forward, they will take a different set of actions to accomplish the same goal. Double-loop learning, on the other hand, is a more complicated process in which a mistake is corrected by rethinking the initial goal. In the previous example, the person would show double-loop learning if they chose to reevaluate their goal and beliefs instead of simply reassessing their failed actions. They will then take a set of actions that are aligned with their reevaluated goals and beliefs. Argyris and Schön explain that both single-loop and double-loop learning processes are present in organizations and are two types of organizational learning. Single-loop learning occurs when an organization detects a mistake, corrects it, and carries on with its present policies and objectives. Double-loop learning occurs when an organization detects a mistake and changes its policies and objectives before it can take corrective actions.
* &quot;Adaptation and routines&quot;: In their book defining the behavioral theory of the firm, Richard Cyert and James G. March described organizational learning as an organization&#x27;s adaptive behavior over time. This consists of the adaptation of goals, adaptation in attention rules, and adaptation in search rules. Part of organizational learning is setting goals and changing these goals over time. They change along with an organization&#x27;s members are established as problems arise. When setting goals, an organization should consider three variables: &quot;the organization&#x27;s past goal, the organization&#x27;s past performance, and the past performance of other &#x27;comparable&#x27; organizations.&quot; Adapting an organization&#x27;s attention rules consists of determining which parts of an organization&#x27;s environment requires most attention. Cyert and March give the example of the criteria an organization uses to evaluate employees&#x27; performances. Over time, organizations learn which criteria to use for their evaluations and how much weight to assign to each criterion. They also use the example of selecting which criteria to use when comparing one&#x27;s organization with a similar one. An organization&#x27;s adaptation in search rules refers to its ability to find solutions for its problems. Since a solution depends on the problem, an organization&#x27;s search rules will change accordingly. Typically, an organization will be more likely to search for a solution a certain way if this search method previously succeeded in finding a solution. An organization&#x27;s search rules will depend on its previous successes or failures with the alternative search rules.
* &quot;Learning curves&quot; by Dutton &amp; Thomas (1984): John M. Dutton and Annie Thomas organized field studies on various industries to study the rates of learning in organizations. They found that workers&#x27; errors and/or costs decrease as they learn from experience. However, since the knowledge that workers&#x27; can learn lessens over time, they cannot improve their performance at a constant rate. Instead, the rate by which they improve decreases with more experience. Dutton and Thomas also found that there are four causal categories that affect a firm&#x27;s progress. Two categories, exogenous and endogenous learning, describe the source of a firm&#x27;s progress. Exogenous learning occurs when a firm acquires information from external sources that allow it to progress. Examples of external sources include &quot;suppliers, customers, competitors, and government.&quot; Endogenous learning occurs when employees learn from within the firm, which is &quot;manifested by technical changes, direct-labor learning, and smoothing production flows.&quot; The other two categories, induced and autonomous learning, describe the environments in which progress occurs. Induced learning occurs when a firm makes investments or adds resources to an environment to make it conducive for learning. Autonomous learning occurs when sustained production leads to automatic improvements over long periods of time.

== Knowledge ==
Knowledge is an indicator of organizational learning. Organization learning happens when there is a change in the knowledge of an organization. Researchers measure organizational knowledge in various ways. For example, some researchers assess knowledge as changes in an organization&#x27;s practices or routines that increase efficiency. Other researchers base it on the number of patents an organization has. Knowledge management is the process of collecting, developing, and spreading knowledge assets to enable organizational learning.

=== Nature of knowledge ===
Knowledge is not a homogenous resource. Although it is related to data and information, knowledge is different from these constructs. Data are a set of defined, objective facts concerning events, while information is a value-added form of data that adds meaning through contextualization, categorization, calculation, correction, or condensation. Knowledge is the applied version of information, a combination of information within experience, framing, value, contextualization, and insight. Experience is knowledge that is generated through exposure to and application of knowledge. Knowledge originates within and is applied by units of an organization to evaluate and utilize experience and information effectively. Knowledge can become embedded within repositories, routines, processes, practices, tools, and norms, depending on the relationship between information, experience, and knowledge.

Two distinct forms of knowledge, explicit and tacit, are significant in this respect. Explicit knowledge is codified, systematic, formal, and easy to communicate. Tacit knowledge is personal, context-specific, subjective knowledge.
* Explicit knowledge is knowledge that is easy to transfer. Unlike tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge is declarative or factual. It is transferred through written, verbal, or codified media. Examples of this include instructions, definitions, and documents. Among its employees, Toyota spreads explicit knowledge about its assembly line production. Toyota requires each team of workers and each individual worker to document their tasks, providing detailed descriptions on &quot;how each task is to be performed, how long each task should take, the sequence of steps to be followed in performing each task, and the steps to be taken by each worker in checking his or her own work.&quot; This uses explicit knowledge since the knowledge is passed along using a code, which is a document of detailed descriptions in Toyota&#x27;s case.
* Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to transfer. As first described by Michael Polanyi, tacit knowledge is the knowledge of procedures. It is a personal type of knowledge that cannot be shared simply through written or verbal communication. It is learned mostly through experience over time. For example, Toyota transfers tacit knowledge whenever it opens a new assembly factory. To train its new employees for a new factory, Toyota sends a group of its new employees to work at one of its established factories, where experienced employees train them. After this long-term training, they are sent back to the new factory to transfer their production knowledge to the rest of the new employees. This is a transfer of tacit knowledge since this knowledge is too complex to be codified and passed along through a document. This knowledge can only be transferred to new employees through practice and experience.

=== Measuring learning ===
Organizational learning tracks the changes that occur within an organization as it acquires knowledge and experience. To evaluate organizational learning, the knowledge an organization creates, transfers, and retains must be quantified.

Researchers studying organizational learning have measured the knowledge acquired through various ways since there is no one way of measuring it. Silvia Gherardi measured knowledge as the change in practices within an organization over time, which is essentially learning from experience. In her study, she observed an organization acquire knowledge as its novices working at building sites learned about safety through experience and became practitioners. George Huber measured knowledge as the distribution of information within an organization. In his study, he noted that &quot;organizational components commonly develop &#x27;new&#x27; information by piecing together items of information that they obtain from other organizational units.&quot; He gives the example of &quot;a shipping department [that] learns that a shortage problem exists by comparing information from the warehouse with information from the sales department.&quot;

An increasingly common and versatile measure of organizational learning is an organizational learning curve demonstrating experience curve effects. A learning curve measures the rate of a metric of learning relative to a metric for experience. Linda Argote explains that &quot;large increases in productivity typically occur as organizations gain experience in production.&quot; However, Argote also notes that organizations&#x27; rates of learning vary. Argote identifies three factors that affect these rates: increased proficiency of individuals, improvements in an organization&#x27;s technology, and improvements in its structure (such as its routines and methods of coordination). Some organizations show great productivity gains while others show little or no gains, given the same amount of experience.The experience curves plot the decreasing unit cost versus the total cumulative units produced, a common way to measure the effect of experience. The linear-linear input form on the left is transformed into the log-log form on the right to demonstrate that the proficiency increase correlates with experience.

=== Theoretical models ===
Attempts to explain variance of rates in organizational learning across different organizations have been explored in theoretical models. Namely the theoretical models conceived by John F. Muth, Bernardo Huberman, and Christina Fang.
* The Muth model (1986) was the first to represent the learning curve in a log-linear form and focused on cost effectiveness in organization processes. This model looks at the relationship between unit cost and experience, stating that cost reductions are realized through independent random sampling, or randomized searches, from a space of technological, managerial, or behavioral alternatives. This model did not aim to explore variation across firms, but solely looked at improvements in production with experience within a single firm.
* The Huberman model (2001) filled that void and aimed at explaining the variation missing from Muth&#x27;s model and focuses on finding increasingly shorter and more efficient paths from end to end of an assembly process. This model is visualized best in a connected graph with nodes that represent stages in a process and links that represent the connecting routines. By way of this model, learning can occur through two mechanisms that shorten the route from the initial stage to the final stage. The first is by some shortcut that can be identified by looking at the nodes and mapping and discovering new routines, the ideal goal being able to eliminate certain touch points and find shorter paths from the initial to final node. The second mechanism involves improving the routines: the organization can work to select the most efficacious link between two nodes such that, if an issue ever arises, members of an organization know exactly whom to approach, saving them a considerable amount of time. 
*The Fang model (2011) shares a major goal with the Huberman model: to gradually decrease the steps towards the final stage. However, this model takes more of a &quot;credit assignment&quot; approach in which credit is assigned to successive states as an organization gains more experience, and then learning occurs by way of credit propagation. This implies that as an organization gains more experience with the task, it is better able to develop increasingly accurate mental models that initially identify the values of states closer to the goal and then those of states farther from the goal. This then leads to a reduced number of steps to reach the organization&#x27;s final goal and can thus improve overall performance.

=== Context and learning ===
An organization&#x27;s experience affects its learning, so it is important to also study the context of the organizational climate, which affects an organization&#x27;s experience. This context refers to an organization&#x27;s characteristics, specifically its &quot;structure, culture, technology, identity, memory, goals, incentives, and strategy.&quot; It also includes its environment, which consists of its competitors, clients, and regulators. While this context establishes how knowledge is acquired by the organization, this knowledge modifies context as the organization adapts to it. The leader-initiated cultural context of learning has inspired key research into whether the organization has a learning or performance orientation, an environment of psychological safety,
the group&#x27;s superordinate identity, and group dynamics. Research into these concepts like Edmondson&#x27;s study (1999) shows that an organization operating under a context promoting curiosity, information sharing, and psychological safety encourages organizational learning.
&quot;Group learning dynamics&quot; is the subject of how groups share, generate, evaluate, and combine knowledge as they work together.

=== Organizational forgetting ===
Knowledge acquired through learning by doing can depreciate over time. The depreciation rate is affected by the turnover rate of individuals and how knowledge is stored within the organization. Organizations with higher turnover rates will lose more knowledge than others. Organizations with knowledge embedded in technology rather than individuals are more resistant to organizational forgetting. Examples: In the Liberty Shipyard study, in shipyards where relative input was reduced, individual unit cost increased even with increasing cumulative output. In shipyards with no relative input reduction, individual unit cost decreased with increasing cumulative output. In a study of airplane manufacturing at Lockheed, unit costs declined with experience, but this effect weakened over time.

== Processes ==
Three key processes that drive organizational learning are knowledge creation, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer.

=== Knowledge creation ===
Knowledge creation specifically concerns Experience that can be embedded within the organization. Experience is knowledge generated by direct exposure to the subject. This direct exposure is through tasks involving the needs, processes, and environment of the organization. Explicit and tacit knowledge are reinforced and become contextualized when the organization gains knowledge. While experience can produce outputs in data, information, or knowledge, experience in the form of knowledge is useful since this can be transferred, retained, and tacitly or explicitly utilized within organizational processes. Knowledge creation connects to creativity and its relationship to experience. Compared to knowledge transfer and knowledge retention, knowledge creation has not received much research attention.

&quot;Dimensions of experience&quot; are aspects of experience that impact the form and function of knowledge creation.
* The &quot;organizational dimension&quot; refers to the directness or indirectness of experience acquired in addition to the configurations of individuals, units, and networks. 
* The &quot;spatial dimension&quot; refers to the geographic concentration or dispersion of the experience. 
* The &quot;temporal dimension&quot; refers to frequency and pace at which the experience is acquired or its temporal relation to a task.
* The &quot;content dimension&quot; refers to the subject task or unit, outcome, novelty, heterogeneity, and ambiguity.
* The &quot;artificiality dimension&quot; refers to the directness of the experience and the degree to which the experience is fabricated, adapted, or transcribed.

=== Knowledge transfer ===
Knowledge transfer concerns the mechanisms by which experience spreads and embeds itself within the organization. Knowledge transfer can be evaluated using various metrics, including learning curves that demonstrate process improvements over time by comparing the decrease in labor hours to complete a unit of production with the cumulative units produced over time. Wright&#x27;s identification of organizational learning curves preceded more complex outcome considerations that now inform measures of knowledge transfer. While knowledge may transfer tacitly and explicitly as direct experience, organizations can introduce processes and knowledge management systems that facilitate this transfer. Researchers investigate the context of various factors and mechanisms affecting knowledge transfer to determine their beneficial and detrimental effects.

Factors of knowledge transfer include the dimensions of the knowledge described in the prior section, as well as the contexts in which it occurs and mechanisms through which it can occur:
* &quot;Relational context&quot; concerns whether knowledge is interconnected. 
* &quot;Cognitive context&quot; concerns mental abilities and processes regarding knowledge.
* &quot;Motivational context&quot; of personal preferences and social influences affect direct or indirect knowledge transfer behaviors. 
* &quot;Emotional context&quot; impacts mental state and sense of security, which affect knowledge transfer.
* &quot;Social networks&quot; determine the flows through which knowledge can transfer and the node-based conditional limitations on transfer.
* &quot;Personnel movement&quot; between units and organizations impacts available knowledge and geographical, chronological, and social limitations on knowledge transfer. 
* &quot;Routines&quot; impact knowledge transfer as they contain embedded knowledge and teach it through experience repeating the routine. 
* &quot;Templates&quot; affect knowledge transfer as they affect the framing, priming, volume, and content parameters for formal exchanges of knowledge. 
* &quot;Alliances&quot; impact knowledge transfer between formal and informal groups.

=== Knowledge retention ===

Knowledge retention concerns the behavior of knowledge that has been embedded within the organization, characterized by the organizational memory. Organizational memory, quantified by measures such as cumulative knowledge and the rate of decay over time, is impacted by experience, processes and knowledge repositories that affect knowledge retention. Knowledge repositories are of key significance as they are intentional remedies to increase retention. Repositories can include the organization&#x27;s rules and routines, altered by the processes of routine development and routine modification. Transactive memory systems are additional methods by which knowledge holders within the organization can be identified and utilized, subject to their development and performance. Organizations that retain the bulk of their knowledge in individuals are vulnerable to lose that information with high turn over rates. In a study of organizational learning in the automotive and fast food industries, Argote found that high turn over rates lead to lower productivity and decreased organizational memory.

== Applications ==
Applications of organizational learning research and contexts for organizational learning facilitation and practices are numerous. Experience curves can be used to make projections of production costs, compare performance across units, identify the effects of various processes and practices, and make informed financial decisions about how to allocate resources. Utilizing knowledge transfer and retention concepts to recognize, maintain, and reclaim embedded knowledge can help organizations become more efficient with their knowledge. Organizational learning theories and knowledge management practices can be applied to organizational design and leadership decisions.

== Knowledge management practices ==
Various knowledge management concepts and practices are the relevant products of organizational learning research. Work on knowledge transfer applies to knowledge retention and contributes to many of the applications listed below, including the practices of building learning organizations, implementing knowledge management systems, and its context for inter organizational learning and the diffusion of innovations.

=== Development of learning organizations ===
Learning organizations are organizations that actively work to optimize learning. Learning organizations use the active process of knowledge management to design organizational processes and systems that concretely facilitate knowledge creation, transfer, and retention. Organizational metacognition is used to refer to the processes by which the organization &#x27;knows what it knows&#x27;. The study of organizational learning and other fields of research such as organizational development, System theory, and cognitive science provide the theoretical basis for specifically prescribing these interventions. An example of an organizational process implemented to increase organizational learning is the U.S. Army&#x27;s use of a formally structured de-brief process called an after-action review (AAR) to analyze what happened, why it happened, and how it could be improved immediately after a mission. Learning laboratories are a type or learning organization dedicate to knowledge creation, collection, and control.

Learning organizations also address organizational climate by creating a supportive learning environment and practicing leadership that reinforces learning. Creating a supportive learning environment and reinforcing learning depends on the leadership of the organization and the culture it promotes. Leaders can create learning opportunities by facilitating environments that include learning activities, establishing a culture of learning via norms, behaviors, and rules, and lead processes of discourse by listening, asking questions, and providing feedback. Leaders must practice the individual learning they advocate for by remaining open to new perspectives, being aware of personal biases, seeking exposure to unfiltered and contradictory sources of information, and developing a sense of humility.

===Knowledge management systems===
While learning processes depend on the context for optimizing knowledge transfer, the implementation of knowledge management systems incorporates technology into these processes. Knowledge management systems are technologies that serve as a repository, communication, or collaboration tool for transferring and retaining knowledge. Embedding knowledge in technology can prevent organizational forgetting and allow knowledge to transfer across barriers such as distance, organizational unit, and specialization. Knowledge management systems alone are not necessarily successful, but as a communication tool they tangibly reinforce individuals&#x27; ability to spread and reinforce their knowledge.

=== Diffusion of innovation ===
Organizational learning is important to consider in relation to innovation, entrepreneurship, technological change, and economic growth, specifically within the contexts of knowledge sharing and inter organizational learning. As one of the key dynamics behind the knowledge economy, organizational learning informs our understanding of knowledge transfer between organizations. Heterogeneous experience yields better learning outcomes than homogenous experience, and knowledge diffusion spreads heterogeneous experience across organizations. Diffusion of innovations theory explores how and why people adopt new ideas, practices and products. It may be seen as a subset of the anthropological concept of diffusion and can help to explain how ideas are spread by individuals, social networks, and organizations. Innovation policy, economic development initiatives, educational program endeavors, and entrepreneurial incubation and acceleration could all be informed by organizational learning practices.

=== Knowledge protection ===
Digital transformation means that not only machines and IT but also people are digitally interlinked. Knowledge cannot be directly secured same way as information is protected. There are formal and informal methods that can be used to protect organizational knowledge. Formal methods include Legal methods - such as confidentiality agreements, patents, copyrights, licensees and trademarks - and Technical methods - such as protecting communication channels, systems and storage and technically constraining the access to the knowledge. Informal methods instead include secrecy, education, social norms and complexity, i.e. carefully choosing what knowledge to share and to whom, and making sure others do the same. The formal and informal methods should be used in good balance. 
=== Internal knowledge Sharing Mechanism ===
The internal knowledge sharing mechanism can promote and develop the enterprise&#x27;s continuous learning and innovation capabilities and play a role in motivating employees to exchange knowledge with each other. The internal knowledge sharing mechanism can enable enterprises to improve the efficiency of product innovation through the recombination of cooperative knowledge and competitive knowledge.

The internal knowledge sharing mechanism is the way for enterprises to obtain knowledge from competitors. Enterprises first need to obtain available knowledge from competitors, and then internalize, transform and use this new knowledge according to their own company characteristics.

== Barriers and enablers to organizational learning ==

=== Corporate amnesia ===
In case no systematic approach has been applied when creating organizational memory systems, there is a risk of corporate amnesia. Environment of organizational amnesia leads to avoiding mistakes at all cost. Companies should create an environment where learning from mistakes is allowed in order to avoid them happening again. Corporate amnesia is said to be a double-edged sword – it helps to move on by forgetting the wrongdoing, but at the same time it creates a danger of repeating the same error all over again.

=== Developing organizational memory ===
Organizations need to have an organizational memory, a documentation of their milestone events. That documentation needs to be accessible for all involved to have the ability to learn as an organization. Because organizations have a routine of forgetting what they have done in the past and why, organizational memory systems should be created to make the knowledge explicit so that the transparency, coordination and communication in the organizations increase and it becomes possible to learn from past mistakes. OL grows through processes but the essential material is individual&#x27;s memory, culture and experience. Individual learning is the first level in OL. Transfer process to OL is synthesized by &quot;what people learn (know-what) and how they understand and apply this learning (know-how). While learning is the know-how, memory could be perceived as a storage area. Memory plays an active role in a learning process. In a transfer mechanism, mental models are an excellent way to share knowledge and to make it independent from individuals.

Organizational memory is an agglomerate of individual&#x27;s memory, composed by data, information and knowledge. For those three levels of learning, five retention facilities are available:

* Individuals, with their own memory capacity and experience 
* Culture, perceived and thought experience transmitted to the members of the organization. Language is a cultural information transmitted repeatedly 
* Transformation, the logic and repeated continuation of actions transforming an input into an output 
* Structure, link between an individual and its role in the organization 
* External archives, information retailed by sources outside the organization about its past.

The big deal of organizational memory is its availability to be used and re-used. It could represent a competitive advantage but its value is often underestimated because of the complexity to calculate it, even though sometimes employee&#x27;s, customer&#x27;s, supplier&#x27;s, capital&#x27;s and top management&#x27;s memory values are budgeted.

Organization&#x27;s memory needs technological solutions on its side. Technology is often associated with information or communication technology (IT) which relates to different software solutions that support the organization&#x27;s memory and ease the transfer of knowledge 
. Technology can be a barrier if it is not accepted or there is not enough understanding of new technologies. Technology can open for example new ways of communicating, but it is different to find a shared acceptance for its utilization.

IT is an enabler for codifying and distributing data and information as well as both tacit and explicit knowledge. A. Abdulaziz Al-Tameem also states that the interaction between humans and IT enhances OL. Different repositories are used within organization to store corporate knowledge as an extension for the memory. Maintaining organizational memory is enabler for efficient and effective processes and routines but most of all for profitable business. Traditionally, IT was regarded solely as a tool to support human learning. In contrast, with the advent of machine learning in organizations, IT based on machine learning algorithms is now viewed as a further type of organizational learner that learns side-by-side along human learners and can offer its own contributions to organizational learning. To this end, today&#x27;s organizations form complex systems of interrelated human and machine learning that requires coordination and rises a wide range of new managerial issues.

=== The role of organizational culture ===
Culture is considered as the holding strength between members of an organization. Culture brings a representation of past learning and an instrument to communicate it through the organization.

Finding shared vision is important to enable the adaptation of new systems and technologies that can be accepted by the organization and its members. Sharing a culture and encouraging knowledge sharing allows more efficient transfer of knowledge in organization between its levels. Sharing information between different cultures can be limited due to varying norms and it can end up in one or both sides hoarding knowledge 

Willingness to inquire can also be related to differences between culture groups or culture of multicultural organizations in general. Status, modesty, fear of embarrassment, etc. contribute to the interaction we decide or do not decide to initiate. It has been studied that organizational culture is one of the most important enablers in knowledge sharing. When the information is not shared due to hoarding based on cultural differences it becomes a major barrier in business.

Different influential factors regarding characteristics of an organizational culture (especially in knowledge-centered cultures) affect the processes of knowledge management. these can include:

* Social interactions
* Openness in communication
* Trust
* Perception of knowledge
* Top management&#x27;s support and involvement
* Freedom vs. control
* Compensation system (organizational rewards)

=== Virtual environments ===

Organizations are evolving, which is sometimes causing interpretation of experiences more complex. Team members that are geographically apart, may only have an option to learn virtually through electronic devices instead of face-to-face. Communities of practice in virtual environments can create tacit knowledge shared between the different factors such as individual members, rules accepted and technologies used. Technology in this case affects the identity and learning patterns of the community. Building routines in a virtual team and the use of sophisticated technology such as video meetings, creates trust and psychological safety that enables learning.

=== Barriers in organizational learning from 4I framework ===

Developed by Crossan, Lane and White (1999) the 4I framework of organizational learning consists of four social processes; intuiting, interpreting, integrating and institutionalizing. It is proposed by Crossan et al. (1999) that organizational learning is a dynamic and iterative process between exploration and exploitation (March 1991) with feed forward flowing from individual level to organizational level and feedback from organizational to individual. A pivotal characteristic of the framework is the relationship and interplay between action and cognition that it assumes and portrays. It is a framework that was developed to specifically address the phenomenon of strategic renewal.

J. Schilling and A. Kluge (2009) have contributed to the M. Crossan, H. Lane and R. White (1999) 4I framework of organizational learning by identifying the barriers to the learning process. There is a wide variety of barriers in every level of each learning process identified as actional-personal, structural-organizational and societal-environmental.

Actional-personal barriers include such as individual attitudes, thinking, and behavior. Structural-organizational barriers are based in organizational technology, strategy, culture and formality of regulations. In addition to the 4I model, environment is also considered as relevant at all individual, group and organization levels and that is why societal-environmental barriers are also considered. Intuition process barriers are related to individual&#x27;s lack of motivation or such as what is the freedom in the organization to &#x27;think out of the box&#x27;. Societal-environmental barriers of intuition process relate e.g. to the unclear success criteria of the branch of the organization or to cultural misunderstandings. Interpretation process barrier can be e.g. lack of status or a conflict in a relationship between innovator and the group. Integration process barriers that take place at the organizational level can be such as the willingness to maintain positive self-image or the fear of punishment. If the idea is against beliefs commonly held in the industry, the whole sector might reject the idea. A major barrier is, if there is no top management&#x27;s support for the innovative idea. A barrier to institutionalization process is when something previously learned has been forgotten – an innovation or lesson has not been put to practice so that it would become embedded into the structure, procedures and strategy. Some teams or employees may not have enough skills or knowledge to absorb the innovation or there is not enough trust towards the innovation. Management may also have a lack of skills to implement the innovation.

=== Other challenges ===
Several challenges may be identified during the organizational learning process. Milway and Saxton (2011) suggest three challenges related to goals, incentives and processes.

Generational issues and employee turnover are also challenges that organizations might have to consider.

<doc id="227999" wikidata="Q3816357" url="?curid=227999" title="Great Appalachian Valley">
<text>The Great Appalachian Valley, also called The Great Valley or Great Valley Region, is one of the major landform features of eastern North America. It is a gigantic trough, including a chain of valley lowlands, and the central feature of the Appalachian Mountains system. The trough stretches about from Quebec in the north to Alabama in the south and has been an important north–south route of travel since prehistoric times.

==Geography==
The Great Valley marks the eastern edge of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. There are many regional names of the Great Valley, such as the Shenandoah Valley. From a large perspective the Great Valley can be divided into a northern section and a southern section.

===Northern section===
In its northern section, the Great Valley includes the Champlain Valley around Lake Champlain and the upper Richelieu River that drains it into the Saint Lawrence, the Hudson River Valley, Newburgh Valley, and Wallkill Valley, and the Kittatinny Valley, Upper Delaware River Valley, Lebanon Valley, and Cumberland Valley.

A series of mountains bounds the northern half of the Great Valley on both sides. To the east or coastward side, these include, from north to south, the Green Mountains of Vermont, the Taconic Mountains of Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, the Reading Prong, which includes the New York–New Jersey Highlands, also known as the Hudson Highlands, Schunemunk Mountain, and Ramapo Mountains, and South Mountain in Pennsylvania beyond Harrisburg. There is a wide gap between the Reading Prong and South Mountain at Harrisburg, through which the Susquehanna River passes, connecting the Great Valley with the Piedmont region of southeast Pennsylvania. This gap is often considered the dividing point between the northern and southern sections of the Great Valley.

To the west or continental side, a series of more impenetrable mountain regions border the northern Great Valley. The northernmost is the Adirondack Mountains, a southern extension of the Canadian Shield, which reach the valley along the shores of Lake Champlain and Lake George. To their south, beyond the Mohawk Valley and Albany, New York, the Catskill Mountains, which form the northeastern terminus of the Allegheny Plateau, border the valley in the form of the dramatic Catskill Escarpment, which overlooks the middle reaches of the Hudson River and Hudson Valley. Just south of the Catskills, the first folds of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians border the valley, in the form of a continuous ridge (heading south) and known as the Shawangunk Ridge in New York, Kittatinny Mountain in New Jersey, and Blue Mountain in Pennsylvania. This long ridge is broken by several narrow and dramatic gaps, known as wind and water gaps, including Culver&#x27;s Gap in New Jersey, the Delaware Water Gap, where the Delaware River passes into the Lehigh Valley along the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and many gaps in Pennsylvania, including the Pennsylvania Wind Gap, the Lehigh River Gap north of Allentown, the Schuylkill River Gap, the Swatara Gap, the Susquehanna River Gap, and others.

===Southern section===
In its southern section, the Great Valley is bounded to the east by the Blue Ridge Mountains, which extend north into Maryland and Pennsylvania as South Mountain. Regional names of the southern Great Valley include Hagerstown Valley in Maryland, Winchester Valley, and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and West Virginia, the upper valley of the James River, Roanoke Valley, and New River Valley in Virginia, the Holston River Valley in Virginia and Tennessee, and the East Tennessee Valley extending from Virginia through Tennessee to Alabama. The Coosa River Valley is often considered the southernmost part of the Great Valley. These southern portions of the Great Valley are sometimes grouped into two parts, the Valley of Virginia and the Tennessee Valley.

The southern Great Valley is bounded on the east by the Blue Ridge physiographic province, which includes, from north to south, South Mountain in Pennsylvania and Maryland, the Blue Ridge of Virginia, Holston Mountain in Tennessee, and the Unaka Range and the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina. A gap in these mountains exists near Roanoke, Virginia. Other gaps of note in the Blue Ridge of Virginia, connecting the Piedmont region with the Great Valley, include Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap.

Another series of mountains bounds the southern Great Valley to the west, including North Mountain and Great North Mountain, the Allegheny Front, Powell Mountain, the Cumberland Mountains, Walden Ridge, and the Cumberland Plateau. The Cumberland Gap connects the Great Valley region with Kentucky and Tennessee lands to the west. Massanutten Mountain lies in the middle of the Valley of Virginia portion of the Great Valley. The Valley of Virginia is a region of karst, with sinkholes and caverns.

===Climate===
The climate of the Great Valley is generally Warm- or Hot-summer Humid continental in the northern third and Humid subtropical from Pennsylvania southward. The first weather box is from the temperate portion and the second subtropical portion of the valley.

==History==
===Native Americans===

Routes through the valley were first used by Native Americans. In pre-colonial and the early colonial era, a major Indian pathway through the Great Valley was known as the Great Indian Warpath, Seneca Trail, and various other names.

===European colonialism===

For European colonists, the Great Valley was a major route for settlement and commerce in the United States along the Great Wagon Road, which began in Philadelphia. In the Shenandoah Valley, the road was known as the Valley Pike. The Wilderness Road branched off from Great Wagon Road in present-day Roanoke, Virginia, crossed the Cumberland Gap and led to Kentucky and Tennessee, including the fertile Bluegrass region and Nashville Basin. Another branch at Roanoke, called the Carolina Road, led into the Piedmont regions of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

The various gaps connecting the Great Valley to lands to the east and west have played important roles in American history. On the east side, the wide gap in southeast Pennsylvania became the main route for colonization of the Great Valley. By the 1730s, the Pennsylvanian Great Valley west of South Mountain was open to settlement after treaty cessions and purchases from the Indians. The region drew a steady and growing stream of immigrants and became known as &quot;the best poor man&#x27;s country&quot;. European immigrants ultimately thoroughly settled the Great Valley in Pennsylvania and were rapidly migrating and settling southwards into the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. The entire region between southeast Pennsylvania and the Shenandoah Valley soon became famous as a breadbasket, the most productive mixed farming region in America (Meinig, 1986:134). The road from Philadelphia west to the valley and then south through it became very heavily used and known variously as the Great Wagon Road, the Philadelphia Wagon Road, and the Valley Road. The Conestoga wagon was developed around 1725 in the area of the wide opening between Philadelphia and the Great Valley. The Conestoga wagon became the main vehicle for transportation through the Great Valley until the railroad era.

Culver Gap near Culver&#x27;s Lake in Sussex County, New Jersey, was an important route through the Kittatinny Mountain from about 10,000 years ago to present. The gap is more than below the top of the mountain. Lenape Native Americans used the gap to hunt and trade on both sides of the mountain. Early settlers from Pennsylvania used the water drop from Culvers Lake to Branchville for a wide assortment of mills. Turnpikes followed the route of Lenape trails through the gap.

By the 1750s, the Great Valley was well-settled to the southern end of the Shenandoah Valley. Immigrants continued to travel from the Philadelphia area south through the Great Valley beyond Shenandoah, to the vicinity of present-day Roanoke, Virginia. There is a wide gap in the Blue Ridge near Roanoke. A branch of the Great Wagon Road began there, crossing through the gap east into the Piedmont region of North Carolina and South Carolina. This road became known as the Carolina Road. During the 1750s, the stream of migrants traveling south through the valley and into the Carolina Piedmont grew into a flood. At the time, the Carolina Piedmont region offered some of the best land at the lowest prices. A string of towns appeared, including Salisbury, Salem, and Charlotte in North Carolina. In the decades before the American Revolution, the Piedmont &quot;upcountry&quot; of the Carolinas was quickly settled, mostly by recent immigrants who migrated from the north to the south via the Great Valley. Many of these immigrants were Scots-Irish, Germans from the Rhineland-Palatinate area, and Moravians. This upcountry population soon surpassed the older and more established lowcountry population near the Atlantic coast, causing serious geopolitical tensions in the Carolinas during the late 18th century (Meinig, 1986: 291–293).

On the west side, the Cumberland Gap became the main route for migration west from the southern Great Valley to Kentucky and Tennessee. In the north, the Mohawk Valley became a major route for westward expansion, especially after the construction of the Erie Canal, which linked New York City in the east to the Great Lakes region in the Midwest via the Hudson River of the Great Valley and the Mohawk Valley gap.

===American Civil War===

The Great Valley, especially Shenandoah Valley, played an important role during the American Civil War, including its Blue Ridge gaps and nearby Piedmont area and its northward extension to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where the bloodiest and most influential Civil War battle was fought in the Battle of Gettysburg from July 1 to July 3, 1863. The Battle of Gettysburg resulted in over 50,000 casualties, but the Union Army victory under the command of Major General George Meade over General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Confederate Army forces turned the war in the Union&#x27;s favor. 

Civil War-era sites and events in this region include Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; Antietam, Maryland; Chambersburg, Pennsylvania; the Valley Campaign of Northern Virginia; the Valley Campaigns of 1864, also in Virginia; the Battles of Chattanooga in Tennessee; and the Gettysburg Battlefield and Gettysburg National Cemetery in Pennsylvania.

==Transportation==
===Interstate highways===
Today, the main thoroughfares occupying the &quot;southern&quot; Great Valley are:
* from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to the road&#x27;s southern terminus near Dandridge, Tennessee
* from the I-81 interchange to Knoxville
* from Knoxville to Cleveland, Tennessee

In the &quot;northern&quot; valley, the thoroughfares vary. Heading northeast from Harrisburg, I-81 traces the valley to Swatara Gap, then swings north across Blue Mountain and leaves the valley en route to Scranton. I-78 then continues the route through the valley parallel to the southern slopes of Blue Mountain, connecting Harrisburg with Lebanon, Kutztown, and Allentown. At Allentown, I-78 then swings away south into the hills of the Reading Prong en route to New York City. From Allentown into New Jersey and southern New York, the valley is not traced by an interstate highway, though it is traversed at length (and at oblique angles) by both I-80 and I-84, as well as by the Delaware River between Easton, Pennsylvania, and the Delaware Water Gap.

In New Jersey and New York, the valley gradually bends from the northeast to the north, and starting near Newburgh just beyond the Hudson Highlands, I-87 runs much of the valley&#x27;s length into Canada, passing Poughkeepsie, Albany, and Glens Falls. In an east–west section of the valley, I-90 traverses the Mohawk Valley towards Utica. North of Glens Falls, I-87 runs west of the valley through the Adirondack Mountains, though it descends back into the valley near Plattsburgh. At the Canada–US border, I-87 becomes Autoroute 15 and continues north to Montreal. No interstate highway crosses the rugged section of the valley east of Lake George or passes through the agriculturally rich Champlain Valley running north to Burlington, Vermont.

Heading north from Burlington, however, along the east side of Lake Champlain, I-89 runs through the valley&#x27;s northernmost stretches to the Canada–US border, where it becomes Quebec Route 133 and Autoroute 35, which trace the route of the Richelieu River in its southern section, where the Great Valley finally dissipates into the plain of the Saint Lawrence River to the east of Montreal. (The Richelieu River continues northward across the plain and empties into the Saint Lawrence to the northeast of Montreal.)

==Culture==
The Great Valley, especially the southern-middle portion, is within the region known as Appalachia.

<doc id="228001" wikidata="Q1308570" url="?curid=228001" title="Stochastic calculus">
<text>Stochastic calculus is a branch of mathematics that operates on stochastic processes. It allows a consistent theory of integration to be defined for integrals of stochastic processes with respect to stochastic processes. This field was created and started by the Japanese mathematician Kiyosi Itô during World War II.

The best-known stochastic process to which stochastic calculus is applied is the Wiener process (named in honor of Norbert Wiener), which is used for modeling Brownian motion as described by Louis Bachelier in 1900 and by Albert Einstein in 1905 and other physical diffusion processes in space of particles subject to random forces. Since the 1970s, the Wiener process has been widely applied in financial mathematics and economics to model the evolution in time of stock prices and bond interest rates.

The main flavours of stochastic calculus are the Itô calculus and its variational relative the Malliavin calculus. For technical reasons the Itô integral is the most useful for general classes of processes, but the related Stratonovich integral is frequently useful in problem formulation (particularly in engineering disciplines). The Stratonovich integral can readily be expressed in terms of the Itô integral, and vice versa. The main benefit of the Stratonovich integral is that it obeys the usual chain rule and therefore does not require Itô&#x27;s lemma. This enables problems to be expressed in a coordinate system invariant form, which is invaluable when developing stochastic calculus on manifolds other than R&quot;n&quot;.
The dominated convergence theorem does not hold for the Stratonovich integral; consequently it is very difficult to prove results without re-expressing the integrals in Itô form.

== Itô integral ==
The Itô integral is central to the study of stochastic calculus. The integral formula_1 is defined for a semimartingale &quot;X&quot; and locally bounded predictable process &quot;H&quot;. 

== Stratonovich integral ==
The Stratonovich integral or Fisk–Stratonovich integral of a semimartingale formula_2 against another semimartingale &quot;Y&quot; can be defined in terms of the Itô integral as

:formula_3

where [&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;]&quot;t&quot;&quot;c&quot; denotes the optional quadratic covariation of the continuous parts of &quot;X&quot;
and &quot;Y&quot;, which is the optional quadratic covariation minus the jumps of the processes formula_2 and formula_5, i.e.
:formula_6.
The alternative notation

:formula_7

is also used to denote the Stratonovich integral.

== Applications ==

An important application of stochastic calculus is in mathematical finance, in which asset prices are often assumed to follow stochastic differential equations. For example, the Black–Scholes model prices options as if they follow a geometric Brownian motion, illustrating the opportunities and risks from applying stochastic calculus.

== Stochastic integrals ==
Besides the classical Itô and Fisk–Stratonovich integrals, many other notions of stochastic integrals exist, such as the Hitsuda–Skorokhod integral, the Marcus integral, and the Ogawa integral.

<text>Pyhäjärvi (1993–1995 &quot;Pyhäsalmi&quot;) is a town and municipality in the south of Northern Ostrobothnia region, Finland. Pyhäjärvi also borders the Northern Savonia and Central Finland regions. The town belongs to the subregion of Nivala–Haapajärvi. Its seat is in &quot;Pyhäsalmi&quot;.

Neighbouring municipalities are Haapajärvi, Kiuruvesi, Kärsämäki, Pielavesi, Pihtipudas and Pyhäntä. As the highway 4 (E75), the highway 27 and the Ylivieska–Iisalmi railway all run through the town, Pyhäjärvi is well situated in an intersection of communication and transport services. The town has also an airfield.

The town of Pyhäjärvi was founded in 1866, and it was then named after Lake Pyhäjärvi, a lake of and rich in fish. Pyhäjärvi became officially a town in January 1993. The town has inhabitants (), of whom some 60 percent live in the two population centres Pyhäsalmi and Ruotanen. It is the second smallest town of Finland in term of population after Kaskinen in the Ostrobothnia region.

Pyhäjärvi contains Europe&#x27;s deepest base metal mine, the deep Pyhäsalmi Mine from where zinc and copper is mined. Underground mining was due to end in 2019, but has been granted approximately 14 months more of mining activity due to an increase in demand for pyrite from Yara in Siilinjärvi. The on-surface refinery will be operational until 2025. The mine facilities and the associated infrastructure will be used for underground business and research under the Callio Pyhäsalmi project.

<text>A meeting is when two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal or business setting, but meetings also occur in a variety of other environments. Meetings can be used as form of group decision-making.

== Definition ==

A meeting refers to a gathering with a specific agenda and not just mere gathering of people casually talking to each other. Meetings may occur face-to-face or virtually, as mediated by communications technology, such as a telephone conference call, a skyped conference call or a videoconference. One Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a meeting as &quot;an act or process of coming together&quot; - for example &quot;as [...] an assembly for a common purpose [...]&quot;.

Meeting planners and other meeting professionals may use the term &quot;meeting&quot; to denote an event booked at a hotel, convention center or any other venue dedicated to such gatherings.

Anthropologist Helen B. Schwartzman defines a meeting as &quot;a communicative event involving three or more people who agree to assemble for a purpose ostensibly related to the functioning of an organization or group.&quot; For her, meetings are characterized by &quot;multiparty talk that is episodic in nature, and participants either develop or use specific conventions for regulating this talk.&quot;

== Types ==


The term &quot;meeting&quot; may refer to a lecture (one presentation), seminar (typically several presentations, small audience, one day), conference (mid-size, one or more days), congress (large, several days), exhibition or trade show (with staffed stands being visited by passers-by), workshop (smaller, with active participants), training course, team-building session and kick-off event.

Common types of meeting include:
* Committee meeting, a coming-together of a defined subset of an organization
* Investigative meeting, generally when conducting a pre-interview, exit interview or a meeting among the investigator and representative
* Kickoff meeting, the first meeting with a project team and the client of the project to discuss the role of each team-member
* Town hall meeting, an informal public gathering.
* Work meeting, which produces a product or intangible result such as a decision; compare working group.
:* Board meeting, a meeting of the board of directors of an organization
:* Management meeting, a meeting among managers
:* Staff meeting, typically a meeting between a manager and those that report to that manager
:* Team meeting, in project contexts - a meeting among colleagues working on various aspects of a team project.

Other varieties include breakfast meetings off-site meetings (or Awayday meetings in the UK), and &quot;stand-up meetings&quot; where participants stand up to encourage brevity.

Since a meeting can be held once or often, the meeting organizer has to determine the repetition and frequency of occurrence of the meeting: one-time, recurring meeting, or a series meeting such as a monthly &quot;lunch and learn&quot; event at a company, church, club or organization in which the placeholder is the same, but the agenda and topics to be covered vary. In Russian, a &quot;flying meeting&quot; () is a hastily called brief meeting.

== Conversational analysis ==

Meetings have been studied using conversation analysis. Meetings are thought of as a distinct &quot;speech exchange system&quot; with different norms and rules. Participants may move in and out of the conversation exchange system during the meeting. A meeting will often have a chair who has some control over the discussion in the meeting. The chair may have a superior position in a social hierarchy or be appointed as a facilitator.

The beginning of the meeting speech exchange system is often indicated by nonverbal cues, or stating the purpose of the meeting. In formal meetings, the chair has control over turn-taking in a conversation. In informal meetings the participants often decide for themselves who turn taking functions with the chair occasionally intervening. Non-verbal communication with the chair may be used to take a turn.

Often the chair will control the choice of topic of discussion, different chairs will control the conversation in different ways. A pre-closing formulation is an individual&#x27;s summarization of the groups understanding of a topic. Silence is often used to indicate agreement to this final formalization. Turns within a topic are expected to be related to previous turns of the topic as a whole. In settings turns are long and more loosely related to the previous turns. In these cases, the speaker may introduce the subject matter of the turn and related it to the agenda topic.

<doc id="228009" wikidata="Q1941955" url="?curid=228009" title="Facilitation (organisational)">
<text>Facilitation in business, organizational development and consensus decision-making refers to the process of designing and running a meeting according to a previously agreed set of requirements.

Facilitation concerns itself with all the tasks needed to reach a productive and impartial meeting outcome that reflects the agreed objectives and deliverables defined upfront by the meeting owner or client.

Facilitation involves leading a meeting on behalf of someone else. This is what distinguishes it from meeting science, which aims to develop the autonomy of meeting initiators and leaders. Nonetheless, facilitation applies many concepts and tools widely used in meeting science such as icebreakers.

== Areas of application ==
Facilitation is &quot;used in a wide range of situations and occupations, including workplaces, leisure and health activities, organizational planning and community development&quot;. Facilitation serves the needs of any group who are meeting with a common purpose, whether it be making a decision, solving a problem, or simply exchanging ideas and information. It does not lead the group, nor does it try to distract or to entertain. A slightly different interpretation focuses more specifically on a group that is engaged in experiential learning. In particular this is associated with active learning and concepts of tutelary authority. This is covered in-depth in the research work of John Heron at the University of Surrey and the International Centre for Co-operative Inquiry.

== Competencies ==

The International Association of Facilitators has defined a range of core competencies compiled into a Core Facilitator Competencies framework that includes 6 main competencies and several sub-competencies that underpin a wide range of facilitation dynamics.

== Dynamics ==
; Setting ground rules: Often disregarded by those untrained in facilitation, setting ground rules is a key component of the facilitation process especially in meetings convened to discuss difficult problems or for training. These rules are usually reiterated in some form at the outset of a facilitated meeting or workshop to ensure participants understand the various roles being employed and the responsibilities accorded to each. Certain aspects feature highly such as:
:* being open to suggestions
:* building on what is there, not knocking down ideas
:* allowing others space (to speak or express themselves)
:* mutual respect
:* that the facilitator does not own the topic under discussion and the identity of that owner is clear
:* rules of engagement such as time-outs and procedures that will be adopted
:* how unresolved issues will be captured and dealt with
:* Finally it is key that, during the meeting, it is clear that the owner of the topic is not expected to intervene to impose ideas beyond setting out parameters for consideration or to give insight. The facilitator in this respect owns the process of the meeting.
These are all closely associated with the idea of facilitation as a tool of (workplace) empowerment.
;Consulting with the client: A facilitator will work with a client who is someone in an organisation, or diverse group, who is calling them and has invited the facilitator to assist. They will try to understand the purpose and outcome of the meeting by discussing it with the client.
;Making arrangements for the meeting: The practical arrangements will be arranged or managed by the facilitator. They will also consider in detail the location and layout of the room. They will research the meeting beforehand to understand why it is being held and that all stakeholders are invited and able to attend.
;Setting the agenda: They will understand in detail how each item on the agenda is to be tackled and how long it should take. Using specialist techniques they will allow participants to understand all the issues at stake and all alternative courses of action. The Facilitator designs the process (agenda) based on his or her discussions with the participants and the Facilitator&#x27;s process expertise.
;Understanding group norms: They will not make assumptions about the way people interact and will try to adapt to the ways of different cultures and organisations.
;Understanding group dynamics: Whilst tackling the practical aspects of a meeting they remain aware of undercurrents, both verbal and non-verbal, which may indicate problems the group is having. The facilitator may try to assist the group in becoming aware of these.
;Consider the need to flexcilitate &quot;Flex-cil-a-tate&quot;: whereby one flexibly facilitates a discussion or a meeting with an end goal and a plan in mind to get there and then adjust the plan based on the responses and direction the group go but still bring them back around to the end goal.

==Facilitator==
The tasks and responsibilities listed below do not need to be covered by a single facilitator. The role is often shared by multiple people, for instance one person may arrange the logistics before the meeting, another person may keep time and monitor the agenda during the meeting, and a third person may be responsible for recording agreements.

*Prior to a meeting, facilitators:
** research the meeting
** find out the purpose and goal (if any) of the meeting
** establish who needs to attend
** draw up a draft agenda and design the group processes to attain the necessary results
** share the agenda with potential attendees, changing it as necessary
** ensure everyone gets fully briefed for the meeting and that everyone knows the purpose and potential consequences of the meeting
*During the meeting, facilitators:
** monitor the agenda
** keep time
** manage the group process
** encourage participation from all attendees
** help participants understand different points of view
** foster solutions that incorporate diverse points of view
** manage participant behaviour
** create a safe environment
** teach new thinking skills and facilitate structured thinking activities
** record (with an agreed phraseology) agreements. They may also note unresolved issues for later debate.
*The facilitator may write up and publish the results of the meeting to everyone concerned including those who could not attend.

==Forms of meeting==
A meeting usually means everyone is together in the same room at the same time and this is the major situation in which facilitation is practiced. With the introduction of modern telecommunications the field has grown to embrace other forms of meetings:
;Same time same place: The traditional meeting in a room with all parties present at the same time.
;Same time different place: The teleconference with either all parties at separate locations or with some in geographically dispersed sub meetings, all with audio / video connection.
;Different time same place: A meeting focussing on a particular physical location where people contribute as they pass by. A wall mounted notice board and/or poster display which allows individuals to add comments as they pass is one example . A survey using un-networked computers in a kiosk would also be a &quot;different time same place&quot; meeting.
;Different time different place: Meeting via a web link such as discussion groups, forums, blogs, and usenet. Specialist web-enabled group decision support software exists. Wikipedia discussion pages fall into this category.

; Virtual facilitation
With the upheaval of the Digital Revolution the widespread use of Video conference combined with other digital tools for collaboration gave rise to an emergent field of virtual facilitation that occurs in the same time, different place meetings. Online meetings and workshops are great examples of virtual facilitation. In short, the approach brings remote team members together to discuss relevant topics in real-time.

<text>Camping is a form of outdoor recreation or outdoor education involving overnight stays with a basic temporary shelter such as a tent. Camping can also include a recreational vehicle, sheltered cabins, a permanent tent, a shelter such as a bivy or tarp, or no shelter at all. Typically, participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors, in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment or in a form of educational experience. Spending the night away from home distinguishes camping from day-tripping, picnicking, and other outdoor activities.

Camping as a recreational activity became popular among elites in the early 20th century. With time, it grew in popularity among other socioeconomic classes. Modern campers frequent publicly owned natural resources such as national and state parks, wilderness areas, and commercial campgrounds. In a few countries, including Sweden and Scotland, public camping is legal on privately held land as well. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations around the world, such as Scouting, which use it to teach both self-reliance and teamwork. School camping trips also have numerous benefits and can play an essential role in the personal growth and development of students.

==Definition==
The Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary defines camping as:

Camping describes a range of activities and approaches to outdoor accommodation. Survivalist and wild campers typically set off with as little as possible to get by. Other campers might use specialized camping gear designed to provide comfort, including their own power and heat sources as well as camping furniture. Camping may be combined with hiking, as in backpacking, and is often enjoyed in conjunction with other outdoor activities such as canoeing, kayaking, climbing, fishing, and hunting. Fastpacking involves both running and camping.

There is no universally held definition of what is and what is not camping. Just as with motels, which serve both recreational and business guests, the same campground may serve recreational campers, school field trips, migrant workers, and the homeless at the same time. Fundamentally, it reflects a combination of intent and the nature of the activities involved. A children&#x27;s summer camp with dining hall meals and bunkhouse accommodations may have &quot;camp&quot; in its name but fails to reflect the spirit and form of &quot;camping&quot; as it is broadly understood. Similarly, a homeless person&#x27;s lifestyle may involve many common camping activities, such as sleeping out and preparing meals over a fire but fails to reflect the elective nature and pursuit of spirit rejuvenation that are an integral aspect of camping.

==History==
The history of recreational camping is often traced back to Thomas Hiram Holding, a British traveling tailor, but it was first popularised in the UK on the River Thames. By the 1880s, large numbers of visitors took part in the pastime, which was connected to the late Victorian craze for pleasure boating. Although Thomas Hiram Holding is often seen as the father of modern camping in the UK, he was responsible for popularising a different type of camping in the early twentieth century. He experienced the activity in his youth when he spent much time traveling across the American prairies with his parents. Later he embarked on a cycling and camping tour with some friends across Ireland. His book on his Ireland experience, &quot;Cycle and Camp in Connemara&quot; led to the formation of the first camping group in 1901, the Association of Cycle Campers, later to become the Camping and Caravanning Club. He wrote &quot;The Campers Handbook&quot; in 1908, so that he could share his enthusiasm for the great outdoors with the world.

Possibly the first commercial camping ground in the world was Cunningham&#x27;s camp, near Douglas, Isle of Man, which opened in 1894. In 1906, the Association of Cycle Campers opened its first camping site in Weybridge. By that time, the organization had several hundred members. In 1910 the Association was merged into the National Camping Club. Although the First World War was responsible for a certain hiatus in camping activity, the association received a new lease of life after the war when Sir Robert Baden-Powell (founder of the Boy Scouts movement) became its president in 1919.

In the US, camping may be traced to William Henry Harrison Murray&#x27;s 1869 publication of &quot;Camp-Life in the Adirondacks,&quot; resulting in a flood of visitors to the Adirondacks that summer.

During the early twentieth century, the popularity of camping in the United States grew as a result of the publicity created by The Vagabonds: Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, John Burroughs, and Harvey S. Firestone. This group of famous American businessmen, inventors, and authors traveled for ten years to different states, and the press highly documented their trips from across the country. Oftentimes, &quot;...these rough and tumble pioneers would drive toward the Adirondacks and essentially live off the land, camping at farms and buying food along the way just like ordinary Americans out for a holiday on the road.&quot;

The International Federation of Camping Clubs (Fédération Internationale de Camping et de Caravanning) was founded in 1932, and national clubs from many countries affiliated with it. By the 1960s, camping had become an established family holiday standard, and today, campsites are widespread across Europe and North America.

==Types==

Different types of camping may be named after their form of transportation, such as canoe camping, car camping, RVing, and backpacking, including ultralight backpacking.

Camping is also labeled by lifestyle: Glamping (glamorous camping) combines camping with the luxury and amenities of a home or hotel, and has its roots in the early 1900s European and American safaris in Africa. Workamping allows campers to trade their labor variously for discounts on campsite fees, campground utilities, and even some degree of pay. Migrant camps are formed not for recreation but as a temporary housing arrangement. Campgrounds for custom harvesters in the United States may include room-to-park combines and other large farm equipment.
Camping is also popular at air shows, notably at the Oshkosh air show where people often camp in a small tent under their aircraft&#x27;s wing.

=== Religious camping ===
==== Christianity ====
===== Evangelical Christianity =====

In Evangelical Christianity, camping for a spiritual retreat was encouraged by the development of camp meetings in the 19th century, to promote spiritual renewal, far from the city and in nature. These camps were an opportunity to pray, sing and listen to sermons for several days.

Various church associations have also established campgrounds or conference centers in isolated locations, which provide retreat times for children and adults.

==Equipment==

The equipment used in camping varies by intended activity. For instance, in survival camping the equipment consists of small items which have the purpose of helping the camper in providing food, heat, and safety. The equipment used in this type of camping must be lightweight and it is restricted to the mandatory items. Other types of camping such as winter camping involve having specially designed equipment in terms of tents or clothing that is strong enough to protect the camper&#x27;s body from the wind and cold.

Survival camping involves certain items that campers are recommended to have with them in case something goes wrong and they need to be rescued. A survival kit includes mandatory items that are small and must fit in one&#x27;s pocket or which otherwise could be carried on one&#x27;s person. This kit is useless in these circumstances if it is kept in the backpack that is left in camp. Such a kit should include a small metal container that can be used to heat water over a campfire, a small length of duct tape which can prove useful in many situations, and an emergency space blanket. These blankets are specially designed to occupy minimal space, can be used as emergency shelters for keeping the camper warm, and their reflective properties mean that they can be easily seen from an aircraft. Candle stubs are good for starting a fire as well as for warming an enclosed space. One or two band-aids are mandatory in this type of camping. Any camper, and not only the survival ones, need waterproof matches or a lighter and a large safety pin or fish hook which can be used in fishing. Rubber gloves, antiseptic wipes, tinfoil, jackknife, or halazone tablets (which purify the water) are also to be included in a survival kit.

===List of common equipment===

The following is a list of commonly used camping equipment:
* First aid kit
* Tent, lean-to, or other form of shelter
* Hammer or mallet to drive tent stakes into the soil (hammers are often a claw hammer, which is also helpful for removing them)
* Sleeping bag and/or blankets for warmth
* Sleeping pad or air mattress to be placed underneath the sleeping bag for cushioning from stones and twigs, as well as for insulation from the ground
* Lantern or flashlight
* Hatchet, axe or saw for cutting firewood for a campfire
* Fire starter for starting a campfire
* Folding chairs for placement around a campfire
* Ropes for stringing clothes line and for securing the shelter
* Tarp for adding a layer of storm protection to a tent, and to shelter dining areas
* Raincoat or poncho
* Hiking boots
* Fishing pole
* Canteen (bottle)
* Chuck box to hold camp kitchen items for food preparation, consumption, and cleanup
* Trash bags, for the handling of waste; see leave no trace
* Cathole trowel for sanitation in areas where a toilet is not provided
* Insect repellent 
* Sunscreen for protecting skin
* rope for climbing or in case someone gets stuck
* Personal care products and towel
* Cooler to store perishables and beverages. If electricity is available, a thermoelectric or stirling engine cooler can be used without the need for ice. Campers at modern campgrounds will normally bring perishable foods in coolers while backcountry campers will bring non-perishable foods such as dried fruits, nuts, jerky, and MREs.
* Bottled water or portable water filter for areas that have access to rivers or lakes
* Cooking implements such as a tripod chained grill, Dutch oven, or La Cotta clay pot can be used for cooking on a campfire. A portable stove can be used where campfires are forbidden or impractical. If using a campground with electricity, an electric frying pan or slow cooker can be used.
* Firewood for campfires
* Emergency Preparedness Kit
* Multi-tool or knife
* Global Positioning System (GPS)

Much of the remaining needed camping equipment is commonly available in the home, including dishes, pots, and pans; however, many people opt not to use their home items but instead utilize equipment better tailored for camping. These amenities include heavy plastic tableware and salt and pepper shakers with tops that close to shelter the shakers from rain. Old kitchen gear purchased from thrift stores or garage sales may also be used in place of home items as an alternative to buying specialized (and more expensive) camping equipment. Backpackers use lightweight and portable equipment.

==Campgrounds and commercial campsites==


Campers span a broad range of age, ability, and ruggedness, and campsites are designed in many ways as well. Many campgrounds have sites with facilities such as fire rings, barbecue grills, utilities, shared bathrooms, and laundry, as well as access to nearby recreational facilities, however, not all campsites have similar levels of development. Campsites can range from a patch of dirt to a level, paved pad with sewer and electricity with many public and private campgrounds also offering cabin options. (For more information on facilities, see the campsite and RV park articles.)

Other vehicles used for camping include motorcycles, touring bicycles, boats, canoes, pack animals, and even bush planes; although backpacking on foot is a popular alternative.
Tent camping sites often cost less than campsites with full amenities, and most allow direct access by car. Some &quot;walk-in&quot; sites lie a short walk away from the nearest road but do not require full backpacking equipment. Those who seek a rugged experience in the outdoors prefer to camp with only tents, or with no shelter at all (&quot;under the stars&quot;).

==Popularity==

===United States===
According to an infographic produced by Red Rover Camping and based on data from the 2014 American Camper Report published by the Coleman Company, Inc. and the Outdoor Foundation, camping in the United States is gaining popularity after a fall of 4.2  million participants from 2011 to 2012.

===United Kingdom===
According to data provided by the Great British Tourism Survey conducted by Visit England, almost 4.5  million camping and caravanning holidays were taken by British residents during the first half of 2015, for an average of 3.7 nights. As in the United States, camping is gaining popularity, with an 8% increase in trips compared to the same period in 2014. The Caravan Club and the Camping and Caravanning Club represent UK campers.

Scotland allows &quot;wild camping&quot; on privately-owned wilderness.

===France===
Data collected by the Fédération Nationale De L&#x27;Hôtellerie De Plein Air (FNHPA) shows that around 113  million nights were taken at French campsites in 2015, which was up by 3.9% in the same period in 2014. French holidaymakers took 77 million of these, and the rest was made up of other nationalities, the majority of whom were Dutch, German, and UK tourists. The French Government hopes to have 100  million tourists each year by 2030. The most popular region for camping is Languedoc and Roussillon with around 19,331,663 nights spent at campsites during 2015, whilst the department with the most campsites is the Vendée.

=== Canada ===

Canada is a country that has four different seasons throughout the year. In this day and age, with the proper camping equipment, it is possible to camp all over Canada all year round. At the end of the 19th century, Canada started establishing areas all over the territory to be later named &quot;National Parks&quot;. These days, the parks are now known for being some of the most popular campgrounds in the country. But it was not always accessible to everyone. In Canada, before the 1910s, camping was reserved only for men. The first camping ground to be established in a National Park in Canada was in 1964 at the Lake Louise.

According to data by a study made by Camping Québec in 2016, 20% of the province of Québec did go camping, that being about 1,600,000 people. In the same research, the study has shown that a certain 8% of those campers were strangers. The popularity of camping in Canada is not only for locals but also for travelers. About 34% of the camp fanatics in Québec are camping on either National Parks or Provincials Parks.

=== Australia ===
According to the Australian government, camping and caravan holds a special place in the hearts of many Australians, as it offers a unique opportunity to connect with the country&#x27;s diverse natural landscapes and rich outdoor heritage. Australia benefits from a favorable climate and an expansive array of camping grounds and sites throughout the country.

Before the onset of COVID-19, there was a notable 67% increase in the number of caravan and camping trips over the preceding decade. In the year concluding in 2019, Australians embarked on a record-breaking 13.9 million caravan and camping journeys. Of these excursions, commercial caravan parks and camping grounds contributed to 52% of trips, 62% of nights spent, and 64% of total expenditure. Since the lifting of COVID-related restrictions, there has been a strong rebound in numbers. By the conclusion of the year in June 2022, trips had reached 12.7 million, while spending surged to an unprecedented $10.5 billion. With over 770,000 caravan and campervan registrations nationwide in 2021, this upward trend is poised to persist.

==Camping and public access==
Camping on open land, regardless of ownership, is legal in a few countries, including Sweden and Scotland. In Sweden, a right of public access – allowing outdoor recreational activity on privately held wilderness – is enshrined in the constitution. Large groups, however, must obtain the landowner&#x27;s permission. In Scotland, people may camp on most unenclosed land, whether state- or privately owned. There is however a &quot;leave-no-trace&quot; policy and a common-law outdoor-access code.

==In popular culture==
Many films and other media have focused on camping or portrayed events regarding camping. Music includes the Phil Ochs album, &quot;Camp Favorites&quot;.

<text>The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for obtaining the maximum a posteriori probability estimate of the most likely sequence of hidden states—called the Viterbi path—that results in a sequence of observed events. This is done especially in the context of Markov information sources and hidden Markov models (HMM).

The algorithm has found universal application in decoding the convolutional codes used in both CDMA and GSM digital cellular, dial-up modems, satellite, deep-space communications, and 802.11 wireless LANs. It is now also commonly used in speech recognition, speech synthesis, diarization, keyword spotting, computational linguistics, and bioinformatics. For example, in speech-to-text (speech recognition), the acoustic signal is treated as the observed sequence of events, and a string of text is considered to be the &quot;hidden cause&quot; of the acoustic signal. The Viterbi algorithm finds the most likely string of text given the acoustic signal.

== History ==
The Viterbi algorithm is named after Andrew Viterbi, who proposed it in 1967 as a decoding algorithm for convolutional codes over noisy digital communication links. It has, however, a history of multiple invention, with at least seven independent discoveries, including those by Viterbi, Needleman and Wunsch, and Wagner and Fischer. It was introduced to natural language processing as a method of part-of-speech tagging as early as 1987.

&quot;Viterbi path&quot; and &quot;Viterbi algorithm&quot; have become standard terms for the application of dynamic programming algorithms to maximization problems involving probabilities.
For example, in statistical parsing a dynamic programming algorithm can be used to discover the single most likely context-free derivation (parse) of a string, which is commonly called the &quot;Viterbi parse&quot;. Another application is in target tracking, where the track is computed that assigns a maximum likelihood to a sequence of observations.

== Algorithm ==
Given a hidden Markov model with a set of hidden states formula_1 and a sequence of formula_2 observations formula_3, the Viterbi algorithm finds the most likely sequence of states that could have produced those observations. At each time step formula_4, the algorithm solves the subproblem where only the observations up to formula_5 are considered.

Two matrices of size formula_6 are constructed:
* formula_7 contains the maximum probability of ending up at state formula_8 at observation formula_4, out of all possible sequences of states leading up to it.
* formula_10 tracks the previous state that was used before formula_8 in this maximum probability state sequence.

Let formula_12 and formula_13 be the initial and transition probabilities respectively, and let formula_14 be the probability of observing formula_15 at state formula_8. Then the values of formula_17 are given by the recurrence relation
formula_18
The formula for formula_10 is identical for formula_20, except that formula_21 is replaced with formula_22, and formula_23.
The Viterbi path can be found by selecting the maximum of formula_17 at the final timestep, and following formula_25 in reverse.

== Pseudocode ==

 function Viterbi(states, init, trans, emit, obs) is
 input states: S hidden states
 input init: initial probabilities of each state
 input trans: S × S transition matrix
 input emit: S × O emission matrix
 input obs: sequence of T observations
 prob ← T × S matrix of zeroes
 prev ← empty T × S matrix
 for each state s in states do
 prob[0][s] = init[s] * emit[s][obs[0]]
 for t = 1 to T - 1 inclusive do &quot;// t = 0 has been dealt with already&quot;
 for each state s in states do
 for each state r in states do
 new_prob ← prob[t - 1][r] * trans[r][s] * emit[s][obs[t]]
 if new_prob &gt; prob[t][s] then
 prob[t][s] ← new_prob
 prev[t][s] ← r
 path ← empty array of length T
 path[T - 1] ← the state s with maximum prob[T - 1][s]
 for t = T - 2 to 0 inclusive do
 path[t] ← prev[t + 1][path[t + 1]]
 return path
 end

The time complexity of the algorithm is formula_26. If it is known which state transitions have non-zero probability, an improved bound can be found by iterating over only those formula_27 which link to formula_8 in the inner loop. Then using amortized analysis one can show that the complexity is formula_29, where formula_30 is the number of edges in the graph, i.e. the number of non-zero entries in the transition matrix.

== Example ==
A doctor wishes to determine whether patients are healthy or have a fever. The only information the doctor can obtain is by asking patients how they feel. The patients may report that they either feel normal, dizzy, or cold.

It is believed that the health condition of the patients operates as a discrete Markov chain. There are two states, &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;fever&quot;, but the doctor cannot observe them directly; they are &quot;hidden&quot; from the doctor. On each day, the chance that a patient tells the doctor &quot;I feel normal&quot;, &quot;I feel cold&quot;, or &quot;I feel dizzy&quot;, depends only on the patient&#x27;s health condition on that day.

The &quot;observations&quot; (normal, cold, dizzy) along with the &quot;hidden&quot; states (healthy, fever) form a hidden Markov model (HMM). From past experience, the probabilities of this model have been estimated as:

In this code, codice_1 represents the doctor&#x27;s belief about how likely the patient is to be healthy initially. Note that the particular probability distribution used here is not the equilibrium one, which would be codice_2 according to the transition probabilities. The transition probabilities codice_3 represent the change of health condition in the underlying Markov chain. In this example, a patient who is healthy today has only a 30% chance of having a fever tomorrow. The emission probabilities codice_4 represent how likely each possible observation (normal, cold, or dizzy) is, given the underlying condition (healthy or fever). A patient who is healthy has a 50% chance of feeling normal; one who has a fever has a 60% chance of feeling dizzy.

A particular patient visits three days in a row, and reports feeling normal on the first day, cold on the second day, and dizzy on the third day.

Firstly, the probabilities of being healthy or having a fever on the first day are calculated. The probability that a patient will be healthy on the first day and report feeling normal is formula_31. Similarly, the probability that a patient will have a fever on the first day and report feeling normal is formula_32.

The probabilities for each of the following days can be calculated from the previous day directly. For example, the highest chance of being healthy on the second day and reporting to be cold, following reporting being normal on the first day, is the maximum of formula_33 and formula_34. This suggests it is more likely that the patient was healthy for both of those days, rather than having a fever and recovering.

The rest of the probabilities are summarised in the following table:

From the table, it can be seen that the patient most likely had a fever on the third day. Furthermore, there exists a sequence of states ending on &quot;fever&quot;, of which the probability of producing the given observations is 0.01512. This sequence is precisely (healthy, healthy, fever), which can be found be tracing back which states were used when calculating the maxima (which happens to be the best guess from each day but will not always be). In other words, given the observed activities, the patient was most likely to have been healthy on the first day and also on the second day (despite feeling cold that day), and only to have contracted a fever on the third day.

The operation of Viterbi&#x27;s algorithm can be visualized by means of a trellis diagram. The Viterbi path is essentially the shortest path through this trellis.

== Extensions ==
A generalization of the Viterbi algorithm, termed the &quot;max-sum algorithm&quot; (or &quot;max-product algorithm&quot;) can be used to find the most likely assignment of all or some subset of latent variables in a large number of graphical models, e.g. Bayesian networks, Markov random fields and conditional random fields. The latent variables need, in general, to be connected in a way somewhat similar to a hidden Markov model (HMM), with a limited number of connections between variables and some type of linear structure among the variables. The general algorithm involves &quot;message passing&quot; and is substantially similar to the belief propagation algorithm (which is the generalization of the forward-backward algorithm).

With an algorithm called iterative Viterbi decoding, one can find the subsequence of an observation that matches best (on average) to a given hidden Markov model. This algorithm is proposed by Qi Wang et al. to deal with turbo code. Iterative Viterbi decoding works by iteratively invoking a modified Viterbi algorithm, reestimating the score for a filler until convergence.

An alternative algorithm, the Lazy Viterbi algorithm, has been proposed. For many applications of practical interest, under reasonable noise conditions, the lazy decoder (using Lazy Viterbi algorithm) is much faster than the original Viterbi decoder (using Viterbi algorithm). While the original Viterbi algorithm calculates every node in the trellis of possible outcomes, the Lazy Viterbi algorithm maintains a prioritized list of nodes to evaluate in order, and the number of calculations required is typically fewer (and never more) than the ordinary Viterbi algorithm for the same result. However, it is not so easy to parallelize in hardware.

== Soft output Viterbi algorithm ==

The soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) is a variant of the classical Viterbi algorithm.

SOVA differs from the classical Viterbi algorithm in that it uses a modified path metric which takes into account the &quot;a priori probabilities&quot; of the input symbols, and produces a &quot;soft&quot; output indicating the &quot;reliability&quot; of the decision.

The first step in the SOVA is the selection of the survivor path, passing through one unique node at each time instant, &quot;t&quot;. Since each node has 2 branches converging at it (with one branch being chosen to form the &quot;Survivor Path&quot;, and the other being discarded), the difference in the branch metrics (or &quot;cost&quot;) between the chosen and discarded branches indicate the &quot;amount of error&quot; in the choice.

This &quot;cost&quot; is accumulated over the entire sliding window (usually equals &quot;at least&quot; five constraint lengths), to indicate the &quot;soft output&quot; measure of reliability of the &quot;hard bit decision&quot; of the Viterbi algorithm.

<doc id="228023" wikidata="Q772677" url="?curid=228023" title="Aulus Cremutius Cordus">
<text>Aulus Cremutius Cordus (died 25 AD) was a Roman historian. There are very few remaining fragments of his work, principally covering the civil war and the reign of Augustus. In AD 25 he was forced by Sejanus, who was praetorian prefect under Tiberius, to take his life after being accused violating the &quot;lex maiestas&quot;.

== Life and death ==
Cordus was accused of treason by Satrius Secundus for having eulogized Brutus and spoken of Cassius as the last of the Romans. The Senate ordered the burning of his writings. Seneca the Younger, however, tells us that he most likely incurred Sejanus&#x27; displeasure for criticising him, because Sejanus had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source—a letter to Cordus&#x27; daughter Marcia—that he starved himself to death. She was also instrumental in saving his work, so that it could be published again under Caligula. Apart from Seneca, he is mentioned by Tacitus, Quintilian, Suetonius and Dio Cassius. Even though Cordus committed suicide, his work survived.

The charge was, according to Tacitus, &quot;a new charge for the first time heard&quot; (&quot;novo ac tunc primum audito crimine&quot;). According to Mary R. McHugh, no one had been charged with &quot;maiestas&quot; (treason) for writing a history (&quot;editis annalibus&quot;). Tacitus wrote of him:

A few years after Cordus&#x27;s death, Seneca the Younger wrote &quot;Ad Marciam&quot; in order to console Marcia, Cordus&#x27;s daughter, on the occasion of her son Metilius&#x27;s death. Even though &quot;Ad Marciam&quot; is not primarily about Cordus, Seneca indicates that the works of Cordus had been re-published. Suetonius unequivocally asserts that the works of Cremutius Cordus were put back into circulation during the reign of Gaius [Caligula].

Marcia seemed to have been actively involved in the re-publication of her father&#x27;s works. When Seneca wrote &quot;Ad Marciam&quot; he mentioned that Metilius had died three years previously and Marcia was unable to seek solace even from her &quot;beloved literature&quot;. Therefore, her contribution to the publication of her father&#x27;s work pre-dates the death of her son.

== Legacy ==
Vasily Rudich believes that &quot;...the extent to which Seneca goes in his glorification of Cremutius Cordus is unbelievable.&quot; He also brings to attention the fact that &quot;Seneca avoids any direct allusion to Cordus&#x27;s alleged Republican sympathies, whatever their true character may have been.&quot; 

According to Rebecca Langlands, Cordus&#x27;s story &quot;...is a tale which vividly demonstrates the possibility that a text might be received in a way which the author had not intended or anticipated, and be received in a way which might have dire consequences for author and text.&quot; As Langlands seems to suggest, Cordus was thus a man deeply misunderstood as a writer intending to vilify the royal family of the time, by his seemingly seditious work.

In his essay &quot;Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome&quot;, Frederick H. Cramer talks about the &quot;...spineless schoolmaster Quintilian [who] grudgingly admitted that &#x27;the bold utterances of Cremutius also have their admirers and deserve their fame, but he went on to assure readers that &#x27;the passages that brought him to his ruin have been expurgated.&#x27;&quot; Cramer also suggests that it was not unlikely for one of Quintilian&#x27;s students to have been Tacitus, who later said:
The Fathers ordered his books to be burned...but some copies survived, hidden at the time, but afterwards published. Laughable, indeed, are the delusions of those who fancy that by their exercise of their ephemeral power, posterity can be defrauded of information. On the contrary, through persecution the reputation of the persecuted talents grows stronger. Foreign despots and all those who have used the same barbarous methods have only succeeded in bringing disgrace upon themselves and glory to their victims.
Cordus also appears in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus: His Fall&quot;. According to Martin Butler, &quot;Jonson gives Cordus an eloquent defence of the historian&#x27;s objectivity, but we never learn what his ultimate fate is. History might redeem the past by preserving truth about it, but it is more likely that truth will be an early casualty of politics.&quot;

<text>Om (or Aum; ; , ISO 15919: &quot;Ōṁ&quot;) is a polysemous symbol representing a sacred sound, syllable, mantra, and invocation in Hinduism. Its written form is the most important symbol in the Hindu religion. It is the essence of the supreme Absolute, consciousness, &quot;Ātman,&quot; &quot;Brahman,&quot; or the cosmic world. In Indian religions, &quot;Om&quot; serves as a sonic representation of the divine, a standard of Vedic authority and a central aspect of soteriological doctrines and practices. It is the basic tool for meditation in the yogic path to liberation. The syllable is often found at the beginning and the end of chapters in the Vedas, the Upanishads, and other Hindu texts. It is described as the goal of all the Vedas. 

&quot;Om&quot; emerged in the Vedic corpus and is said to be an encapsulated form of &quot;Samavedic&quot; chants or songs. It is a sacred spiritual incantation made before and during the recitation of spiritual texts, during &quot;puja&quot; and private prayers, in ceremonies of rites of passage (&quot;samskara&quot;) such as weddings, and during meditative and spiritual activities such as Pranava yoga. It is part of the iconography found in ancient and medieval era manuscripts, temples, monasteries, and spiritual retreats in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. As a syllable, it is often chanted either independently or before a spiritual recitation and during meditation in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

The syllable &quot;Om&quot; is also referred to as Onkara (Omkara) and Pranava among many other names.

== Common names and synonyms ==
The syllable &quot;Om&quot; is referred to by many names, including:
* &quot;&quot; (); literally, &quot;fore-sound&quot;, referring to &quot;Om&quot; as the primeval sound.
* &#x27; () or &#x27; (); literally, &quot;&quot;Om&quot;-maker&quot;, denoting the first source of the sound &quot;Om&quot; and connoting the act of creation.
** &quot;&quot; (); literally, &quot;one &quot;Om&quot;-maker&quot;, and an epithet of God in Sikhism. (see below).
* &quot;&quot; (); meaning &quot;song, chant&quot;, a word found in Samaveda and &quot;bhasya&quot; (commentaries) based on it. It is also used as a name of the syllable Om in Chandogya Upanishad.
* &quot;&quot; (); literally, &quot;imperishable, immutable&quot;, and also &quot;letter of the alphabet&quot; or &quot;syllable&quot;.
** &quot;&quot;; literally, &quot;one letter of the alphabet&quot;, referring to its representation as a single ligature. (see below)

== Origin and spiritual significance ==
The etymological origins of &quot;ōm&quot; &quot;(aum)&quot; have long been discussed and disputed, with even the Upanishads having proposed multiple Sanskrit etymologies for &quot;aum&quot;, including: from &quot;ām&quot; (; &quot;yes&quot;), from &quot;ávam&quot; (; &quot;that, thus, yes&quot;), and from the Sanskrit roots &quot;āv-&quot; (; &quot;to urge&quot;) or &quot;āp-&quot; (; &quot;to attain&quot;). In 1889, Maurice Bloomfield proposed an origin from a Proto-Indo-European introductory particle &quot;*au&quot; with a function similar to the Sanskrit particle &quot;atha&quot; (). However, contemporary Indologist Asko Parpola proposes a borrowing from Dravidian &quot;*ām&quot; meaning &quot;&#x27;it is so&#x27;, &#x27;let it be so&#x27;, &#x27;yes&#x27;&quot;, a contraction of &quot;&quot;*ākum&quot;, cognate with modern Tamil &quot;ām&quot;&quot; () meaning &quot;yes&quot;. In the Jaffna Tamil dialect spoken in Sri Lanka, &quot;aum&quot;&#x27; is the word for yes.

Regardless of its original meaning, the syllable &quot;Om&quot; evolves to mean many abstract ideas even in the earliest Upanishads. Max Müller and other scholars state that these philosophical texts recommend &quot;Om&quot; as a basic tool for meditation and explain the various meanings that the syllable may hold in the mind of one meditating, ranging from &quot;artificial and senseless&quot; to the &quot;highest concepts such as the cause of the Universe, essence of life, Brahman, Atman, and Self-knowledge&quot;.

The syllable &quot;Om&quot; is first mentioned in the Upanishads. It has been associated with various concepts, such as &quot;cosmic sound&quot;, &quot;mystical syllable&quot;, &quot;affirmation to something divine&quot;, or as symbolism for abstract spiritual concepts in the Upanishads. In the Aranyaka and the Brahmana layers of Vedic texts, the syllable is so widespread and linked to knowledge, that it stands for the &quot;whole of Veda&quot;. The symbolic foundations of &quot;Om&quot; are repeatedly discussed in the oldest layers of the early Upanishads. The Aitareya Brahmana of Rig Veda, in section 5.32, suggests that the three phonetic components of &quot;Om&quot; (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;u&quot; + &quot;m&quot;) correspond to the three stages of cosmic creation, and when it is read or said, it celebrates the creative powers of the universe. However, in the eight anuvaka of the Taittiriya Upanishad, which consensus research indicates was formulated around the same time or preceding Aitareya Brahmana, the sound Aum is attributed to reflecting the inner part of the word Brahman. Put another way, it is the Brahman, in the form of a word. The Brahmana layer of Vedic texts equates &quot;Om&quot; with &quot;bhur-bhuvah-svah&quot;, which symbolizes &quot;the whole Veda&quot;. They offer various shades of meaning to &quot;Om&quot;, such as it being &quot;the universe beyond the sun&quot;, or that which is &quot;mysterious and inexhaustible&quot;, or &quot;the infinite language, the infinite knowledge&quot;, or &quot;essence of breath, life, everything that exists&quot;, or that &quot;with which one is liberated&quot;. The Samaveda, the poetical Veda, orthographically maps &quot;Om&quot; to the audible, the musical truths in its numerous variations (&quot;Oum&quot;, &quot;Aum&quot;, &quot;Ovā Ovā Ovā Um&quot;, etc.) and then attempts to extract musical meters from it.

== Pronunciation ==
When occurring within spoken Classical Sanskrit, the syllable is subject to the normal rules of sandhi in Sanskrit grammar, with the additional peculiarity that the initial &quot;o&quot; of &quot;Om&quot; is the guṇa vowel grade of &quot;u&quot;, not the vṛddhi grade, and is therefore pronounced as a monophthong with a long vowel (), ie. &quot;ōm&quot; not &quot;aum&quot;. Furthermore, the final &quot;m&quot; is often assimilated into the preceding vowel as nasalisation (). As a result, &quot;Om&quot; is regularly pronounced in the context of Sanskrit.

However, this &quot;o&quot; reflects the older Vedic Sanskrit diphthong &quot;au&quot;, which at that stage in the language&#x27;s history had not yet monophthongised to &quot;o&quot;. This being so, the syllable &quot;Om&quot; is often archaically considered as consisting of three phonemes: &quot;a-u-m&quot;. Accordingly, some denominations maintain the archaic diphthong &quot;au&quot; viewing it to be more authentic and closer to the language of the Vedas.

In the context of the Vedas, particularly the Vedic Brahmanas, the vowel is often &quot;pluta&quot; (&quot;three times as long&quot;), indicating a length of three morae (), that is, the time it takes to say three light syllables. Additionally, a diphthong becomes with the prolongation of its first vowel. When &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; undergo they typically revert to the original diphthongs with the initial &quot;a&quot; prolonged, realised as an overlong open back unrounded vowel (&quot;ā̄um&quot; or &quot;a3um&quot; ). This extended duration is emphasised by denominations who regard it as more authentically Vedic, such as Arya Samaj.

However, &quot;Om&quot; is also attested in the Upanishads without &quot;pluta&quot;, and many languages related to or influenced by Classical Sanskrit, such as Hindustani, share its pronunciation of &quot;Om&quot; ( or ).

== Written representations ==

=== South Asia ===
Nagari or Devanagari representations are found epigraphically on sculpture dating from Medieval India and on ancient coins in regional scripts throughout South Asia. &quot;Om&quot; is represented in Devanagari as &#x27;, composed of four elements: the vowel letter (), the vowel diacritic (), the consonant letter (), and the &quot;virama&quot; stroke which indicates the absence of an implied final vowel. Historically, the combination represented a diphthong, often transcribed as , but it now represents a long vowel, . (See above.) The syllable is sometimes written &#x27;, where (i.e., the digit &quot;3&quot;) explicitly indicates &quot;pluta&quot; (&#x27;three times as long&#x27;) which is otherwise only implied. For this same reason &quot;Om&quot; may also be written &#x27; in languages such as Hindi, with the () being used to indicate prolonging the vowel sound. (However, this differs from the usage of the in Sanskrit, where it would instead indicate the prodelision of the initial vowel.) &quot;Om&quot; may also be written &#x27;, with an reflecting the pronunciation of in languages such as Hindi. In languages such as Urdu and Sindhi &quot;Om&quot; may be written in Arabic script, although speakers of these languages may also use Devanagari representations.

The commonly seen representation of the syllable &quot;Om,&quot; , is a cursive ligature in Devanagari, combining () with () and the chandrabindu (ँ,). In Unicode, the symbol is encoded at and at as a &quot;generic symbol independent of Devanagari font&quot;.

In some South Asian writing systems, the &quot;Om&quot; symbol has been simplified further. In Bengali and Assamese &quot;Om&quot; is written simply as &#x27; without an additional curl. In languages such as Bengali differences in pronunciation compared to Sanskrit have made the addition of a curl for redundant. Although the spelling is simpler, the pronunciation remains . Similarly, in Odia &quot;Om&quot; is written as &#x27; without an additional diacritic.

In Tamil, &quot;Om&quot; is written as , a ligature of (&quot;ō&quot;) and (&quot;m&quot;), while in Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam, &quot;Om&quot; is written simply as the letter for &quot;ō&quot; followed by (, , and , respectively).

There have been proposals that the &quot;Om&quot; syllable may already have had written representations in Brahmi script, dating to before the Common Era. A proposal by Deb (1921) held that the &quot;swastika&quot; is a monogrammatic representation of the syllable &quot;Om&quot;, wherein two Brahmi /o/ characters () were superposed crosswise and the &#x27;m&#x27; was represented by dot. A commentary in &quot;Nature&quot; (1922) considers this theory questionable and unproven. A. B. Walawalkar (1951) proposed that &quot;Om&quot; was represented using the Brahmi symbols for &quot;A&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, and &quot;M&quot; (), and that this may have influenced the unusual epigraphical features of the symbol for &quot;Om&quot;. Parker (1909) wrote that an &quot;Aum monogram&quot;, distinct from the swastika, is found among Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions in Sri Lanka, including Anuradhapura era coins, dated from the 1st to 4th centuries CE, which are embossed with &quot;Om&quot; along with other symbols.

=== East and Southeast Asia ===
The &quot;Om&quot; symbol, with epigraphical variations, is also found in many Southeast Asian countries.

In Southeast Asia, the &quot;Om&quot; symbol is widely conflated with that of the unalome; originally a representation of the Buddha&#x27;s urna curl and later a symbol of the path to nirvana, it is a popular yantra in Southeast Asia, particularly in Cambodia and Thailand. It frequently appears in &quot;sak yant&quot; religious tattoos, and has been a part of various flags and official emblems such as in the Thong Chom Klao of King Rama IV () and the present-day royal arms of Cambodia.

The Khmer adopted the symbol since the 1st century during the Kingdom of Funan, where it is also seen on artefacts from Angkor Borei, once the capital of Funan. The symbol is seen on numerous Khmer statues from Chenla to Khmer Empire periods and still in used until the present day.

In Chinese characters, &quot;Om&quot; is typically transliterated as either 唵 () or 嗡 ().

== Hinduism ==

{{Hinduism}}

In Hinduism, &quot;Om&quot; is one of the most important spiritual sounds. The syllable is often found at the beginning and the end of chapters in the Vedas, the Upanishads, and other Hindu texts, and is often chanted either independently or before a mantra, as a sacred spiritual incantation made before and during the recitation of spiritual texts, during puja and private prayers, in ceremonies of rites of passages (sanskara) such as weddings, and during meditative and spiritual activities such as yoga.

It is the most sacred syllable symbol and mantra of Brahman, which is the ultimate reality, consciousness or Atman (Self within).

It is called the &quot;Shabda Brahman&quot; (Brahman as sound) and believed to be the primordial sound ({{transl|sa|pranava}}) of the universe.

=== Vedas ===
&quot;Om&quot; came to be used as a standard utterance at the beginning of mantras, chants or citations taken from the Vedas. For example, the Gayatri mantra, which consists of a verse from the Rigveda Samhita (RV 3.62.10), is prefixed not just by &quot;Om&quot; but by &quot;Om&quot; followed by the formula &quot;bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ&quot;. Such recitations continue to be in use in Hinduism, with many major incantations and ceremonial functions beginning and ending with &quot;Om&quot;.

==== Brahmanas ====

===== Aitareya Brahmana =====
The Aitareya Brahmana (7.18.13) explains &quot;Om&quot; as &quot;an acknowledgment, melodic confirmation, something that gives momentum and energy to a hymn&quot;.

{{Blockquote|&quot;Om&quot; is the agreement (&quot;pratigara&quot;) with a hymn. Likewise is &quot;tathā&quot; {{=}} &#x27;so be it&#x27; [the agreement] with a [worldly] song (gāthā) [{{=}} the applause]. But &quot;Om&quot; is something divine, and &quot;tathā&quot; is something human.
|Aitareya Brahmana, 7.18.13}}

==== Upanishads ====
===== Chandogya Upanishad =====
The Chandogya Upanishad is one of the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism. It opens with the recommendation that &quot;let a man meditate on Om&quot;. It calls the syllable &quot;Om&quot; as &quot;udgitha&quot; ({{lang|sa|उद्गीथ}}; song, chant), and asserts that the significance of the syllable is thus: the essence of all beings is earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are the plants, the essence of plants is man, the essence of man is speech, the essence of speech is the Rigveda, the essence of the Rigveda is the Samaveda, and the essence of Samaveda is the &quot;udgitha&quot; (song, &quot;Om&quot;).

{{IAST|Ṛc}} ({{lang|sa|ऋच्}}) is speech, states the text, and {{IAST|sāman}} ({{lang|sa|सामन्}}) is breath; they are pairs, and because they have love for each other, speech and breath find themselves together and mate to produce a song. The highest song is &quot;Om&quot;, asserts section 1.1 of Chandogya Upanishad. It is the symbol of awe, of reverence, of threefold knowledge because &quot;Adhvaryu&quot; invokes it, the &quot;Hotr&quot; recites it, and &quot;Udgatr&quot; sings it.

The second volume of the first chapter continues its discussion of syllable &quot;Om&quot;, explaining its use as a struggle between &quot;Devas&quot; (gods) and &quot;Asuras&quot; (demons). Max Muller states that this struggle between gods and demons is considered allegorical by ancient Indian scholars, as good and evil inclinations within man, respectively. The legend in section 1.2 of Chandogya Upanishad states that gods took the &quot;Udgitha&quot; (song of &quot;Om&quot;) unto themselves, thinking, &quot;with this &quot;song&quot; we shall overcome the demons&quot;. The syllable &quot;Om&quot; is thus implied as that which inspires the good inclinations within each person.

Chandogya Upanishad&#x27;s exposition of syllable &quot;Om&quot; in its opening chapter combines etymological speculations, symbolism, metric structure and philosophical themes. In the second chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad, the meaning and significance of &quot;Om&quot; evolves into a philosophical discourse, such as in section 2.10 where &quot;Om&quot; is linked to the Highest Self, and section 2.23 where the text asserts &quot;Om&quot; is the essence of three forms of knowledge, &quot;Om&quot; is Brahman and &quot;Om is all this [observed world]&quot;.

===== Katha Upanishad =====
The Katha Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy, Nachiketa, the son of sage {{transliteration|sa|Vājaśravasa|italic=no}}, who meets Yama, the Vedic deity of death. Their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of man, knowledge, Atman (Self) and moksha (liberation). In section 1.2, Katha Upanishad characterises knowledge ({{transliteration|sa|vidyā}}) as the pursuit of the good, and ignorance ({{transliteration|sa|avidyā}}) as the pursuit of the pleasant. It teaches that the essence of the Veda is to make man liberated and free, look past what has happened and what has not happened, free from the past and the future, beyond good and evil, and one word for this essence is the word &quot;Om&quot;.

{{poem quote|
The word which all the Vedas proclaim,
That which is expressed in every Tapas (penance, austerity, meditation),
That for which they live the life of a Brahmacharin,
Understand that word in its essence: Om! that is the word.
Yes, this syllable is Brahman,
This syllable is the highest.
He who knows that syllable,
Whatever he desires, is his.
|Katha Upanishad 1.2.15-1.2.16}}

===== Maitri Upanishad =====

The Maitrayaniya Upanishad in sixth &quot;Prapathakas&quot; (lesson) discusses the meaning and significance of &quot;Om&quot;. The text asserts that &quot;Om&quot; represents Brahman-Atman. The three roots of the syllable, states the Maitri Upanishad, are &quot;A&quot; + &quot;U&quot; + &quot;M&quot;.

The sound is the body of Self, and it repeatedly manifests in three:
* as gender-endowed body – feminine, masculine, neuter;
* as light-endowed body – Agni, Vayu, and Aditya;
* as deity-endowed body – Brahma, Rudra,{{efn-ua|later called Shiva}} and Vishnu;
* as mouth-endowed body – &quot;garhapatya&quot;, &quot;dakshinagni&quot;, and &quot;ahavaniya&quot;;{{efn-ua|this is a reference to the three major Vedic fire rituals}}
* as knowledge-endowed body – Rig, Saman, and Yajur;{{efn-ua|this is a reference to the three major Vedas}}
* as world-endowed body – {{IAST|bhūr}}, {{IAST|bhuvaḥ}}, and {{IAST|svaḥ}};{{efn-ua|this is a reference to the three worlds of the Vedas}}
* as time-endowed body – past, present, and future;
* as heat-endowed body – breath, fire, and Sun;
* as growth-endowed body – food, water, and Moon;
* as thought-endowed body – intellect, mind, and psyche.

Brahman exists in two forms – the material form, and the immaterial formless. The material form is changing, unreal. The immaterial formless is not changing, real. The immortal formless is truth, the truth is the Brahman, the Brahman is the light, the light is the Sun which is the syllable &quot;Om&quot; as the Self.{{efn-ua|Sanskrit original, quote: {{lang|sa|द्वे वाव ब्रह्मणो रूपे मूर्तं चामूर्तं च । अथ यन्मूर्तं तदसत्यम् यदमूर्तं तत्सत्यम् तद्ब्रह्म तज्ज्योतिः यज्ज्योतिः स आदित्यः स वा एष ओमित्येतदात्माभवत्}}}}

The world is &quot;Om&quot;, its light is Sun, and the Sun is also the light of the syllable &quot;Om&quot;, asserts the Upanishad. Meditating on &quot;Om&quot;, is acknowledging and meditating on the Brahman-Atman (Self).

===== Mundaka Upanishad =====

The Mundaka Upanishad in the second &quot;Mundakam&quot; (part), suggests the means to knowing the Atman and the Brahman are meditation, self-reflection, and introspection and that they can be aided by the symbol &quot;Om&quot;. It uses a bow and arrow analogy, where the bow symbolizes the focused mind, the arrow symbolizes the self (Atman), and the target represents the ultimate reality (Brahman). 

{{poem quote|
That which is flaming, which is subtler than the subtle,
on which the worlds are set, and their inhabitants –
That is the indestructible Brahman.{{efn-ua|Hume translates this as &quot;imperishable Aksara&quot;, Max Muller translates it as &quot;indestructible Brahman&quot;; see: Max Muller, &quot;The Upanishads&quot;, Part 2, Mundaka Upanishad, Oxford University Press, page 36 and Robert Hume, &quot;Thirteen Principal Upanishads&quot; , page 367}}
It is life, it is speech, it is mind. That is the real. It is immortal.
It is a mark to be penetrated. Penetrate It, my friend.

Taking as a bow the great weapon of the Upanishad,
one should put upon it an arrow sharpened by meditation,
Stretching it with a thought directed to the essence of That,
Penetrate{{efn-ua|The Sanskrit word used is &quot;Vyadh&quot;, which means both &quot;penetrate&quot; and &quot;know&quot;; Robert Hume uses penetrate, but mentions the second meaning; see: Robert Hume, Mundaka Upanishad, &quot;Thirteen Principal Upanishads&quot;, Oxford University Press, page 372 with footnote 1}} that Imperishable as the mark, my friend.

Om is the bow, the arrow is the Self, Brahman the mark,
By the undistracted man is It to be penetrated,
One should come to be in It,
as the arrow becomes one with the mark.
|Mundaka Upanishad 2.2.2 – 2.2.4}}

Adi Shankara, in his review of the Mundaka Upanishad, states &quot;Om&quot; as a symbolism for Atman (Self).

===== Mandukya Upanishad =====
The Mandukya Upanishad opens by declaring, &quot;&quot;Om&quot;!, this syllable is this whole world&quot;. Thereafter, it presents various explanations and theories on what it means and signifies. This discussion is built on a structure of &quot;four fourths&quot; or &quot;fourfold&quot;, derived from &quot;A&quot; + &quot;U&quot; + &quot;M&quot; + &quot;silence&quot; (or without an element).
* &quot;Om&quot; as all states of Time.
*: In verse 1, the Upanishad states that time is threefold: the past, the present and the future, that these three are &quot;Om&quot;. The four fourth of time is that which transcends time, that too is &quot;Om&quot; expressed.
* &quot;Om&quot; as all states of Ātman .
*: In verse 2, states the Upanishad, everything is Brahman, but Brahman is Atman (the Self), and that the Atman is fourfold. Johnston summarizes these four states of Self, respectively, as seeking the physical, seeking inner thought, seeking the causes and spiritual consciousness, and the fourth state is realizing oneness with the Self, the Eternal.
* &quot;Om&quot; as all states of Consciousness.
*: In verses 3 to 6, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates four states of consciousness: wakeful, dream, deep sleep, and the state of &quot;ekatma&quot; (being one with Self, the oneness of Self). These four are &quot;A&quot; + &quot;U&quot; + &quot;M&quot; + &quot;without an element&quot; respectively.
* &quot;Om&quot; as all of Knowledge.
*: In verses 9 to 12, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates fourfold etymological roots of the syllable &quot;Om&quot;. It states that the first element of &quot;Om&quot; is &quot;A&quot;, which is from &quot;Apti&quot; (obtaining, reaching) or from &quot;Adimatva&quot; (being first). The second element is &quot;U&quot;, which is from &quot;Utkarsa&quot; (exaltation) or from &quot;Ubhayatva&quot; (intermediateness). The third element is &quot;M&quot;, from &quot;Miti&quot; (erecting, constructing) or from &quot;Mi Minati, or apīti&quot; (annihilation). The fourth is without an element, without development, beyond the expanse of universe. In this way, states the Upanishad, the syllable Om is indeed the Atman (the self).

===== Shvetashvatara Upanishad =====
The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, in verses 1.14 to 1.16, suggests meditating with the help of syllable &quot;Om&quot;, where one&#x27;s perishable body is like one fuel-stick and the syllable &quot;Om&quot; is the second fuel-stick, which with discipline and diligent rubbing of the sticks unleashes the concealed fire of thought and awareness within. Such knowledge, asserts the Upanishad, is the goal of Upanishads. The text asserts that &quot;Om&quot; is a tool of meditation empowering one to know the God within oneself, to realize one&#x27;s Atman (Self).

===== Ganapati Upanishad =====
{{See also|Ganesha#Om|Ganapatya}}

The Ganapati Upanishad asserts that Ganesha is same as Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, all deities, the universe, and &quot;Om&quot;.{{Sfnp|Grimes|1995|pp=23-24}}

{{blockquote|(O Lord Ganapati!) You are (the Trimurti) Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesa. You are Indra. You are fire {{bracket|Agni}} and air {{bracket|{{IAST|Vāyu}}}}. You are the sun {{bracket|{{IAST|Sūrya}}}} and the moon {{bracket|Chandrama}}. You are Brahman. You are (the three worlds) Bhuloka [earth], Antariksha-loka [space], and Swargaloka [heaven].

==== Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana ====
The Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana, a Samavedic text, outlines a story where those who chant Om can achieve the same rewards as deities. However, the gods are concerned about humans ascending to their realm. To address this concern, a compromise is reached between the gods and Death. Humans can attain immortality, but it involves relinquishing their physical bodies to Death. This immortality entails an extended celestial existence after a long earthly life, where the practitioner aspires to acquire a divine self (atman) in a non-physical form, allowing them to reside eternally in the heavenly realm.

=== Ramayana ===
In Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana, Rama is identified with &quot;Om&quot;, with Brahma saying to Rama:

{{blockquote|&quot;You are the sacrificial performance. You are the sacred syllable {{transliteration|sa|Vashat}} (on hearing which the {{transliteration|sa|Adhvaryu}} priest casts the oblation to a deity into the sacrificial fire). You are the mystic syllable &quot;OM&quot;. You are higher than the highest. People neither know your end nor your origin nor who you are in reality. You appear in all created beings in the cattle and in {{transliteration|sa|brahmana}}s. You exist in all quarters, in the sky, in mountains and in rivers.&quot;|Ramayana, Yuddha Kanda, Sarga 117}}

=== &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; ===
The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, mentions the meaning and significance of &quot;Om&quot; in several verses. According to Jeaneane Fowler, verse 9.17 of the Bhagavad Gita synthesizes the competing dualistic and monist streams of thought in Hinduism, by using &quot;&quot;Om&quot; which is the symbol for the indescribable, impersonal Brahman&quot;.

{{Blockquote|&quot;Of this universe, I am the Father; I am also the Mother, the Sustainer, and the Grandsire. I am the purifier, the goal of knowledge, the sacred syllable &quot;Om&quot;. I am the Ṛig Veda, Sāma Veda, and the Yajur Veda.&quot;
||Krishna to Arjuna, Bhagavad Gita 9.17}}

The significance of the sacred syllable in the Hindu traditions, is similarly highlighted in other verses of the &quot;Gita&quot;, such as verse 17.24 where the importance of &quot;Om&quot; during prayers, charity and meditative practices is explained as follows:

{{Blockquote|&quot;Therefore, uttering Om, the acts of yagna (fire ritual), dāna (charity) and tapas (austerity) as enjoined in the scriptures, are always begun by those who study the Brahman.&quot;
|Bhagavad Gita 17.24}}

=== Puranas ===
The medieval era texts of Hinduism, such as the Puranas adopt and expand the concept of &quot;Om&quot; in their own ways, and to their own theistic sects.

==== Vaishnava traditions ====
The Vaishnava &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; equates the recitation of &quot;Om&quot; with obeisance to Vishnu. According to the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} &quot;Om&quot; is the representation of the Hindu Trimurti, and represents the union of the three gods, viz. &quot;A&quot; for Brahma, &quot;U&quot; for Vishnu and &quot;M&quot; for Shiva. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (9.14.46-48) identifies the &quot;Pranava&quot; as the root of all Vedic mantras, and describes the combined letters of &quot;a-u-m&quot; as an invocation of seminal birth, initiation, and the performance of sacrifice (yajña).

==== Shaiva traditions ====
In Shaiva traditions, the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; highlights the relation between deity Shiva and the &quot;Pranava&quot; or &quot;Om&quot;. Shiva is declared to be &quot;Om&quot;, and that &quot;Om&quot; is Shiva.
After this, an epithet of Shiva is Omkareshwar, the Lord, Ishvara, of oṃkāra.

==== Shakta traditions ====
In the thealogy of Shakta traditions, &quot;Om&quot; connotes the female divine energy, Adi Parashakti, represented in the Tridevi: &quot;A&quot; for the creative energy (the Shakti of Brahma), Mahasaraswati, &quot;U&quot; for the preservative energy (the Shakti of Vishnu), Mahalakshmi, and &quot;M&quot; for the destructive energy (the Shakti of Shiva), Mahakali. The 12th book of the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot; describes the Goddess as the mother of the Vedas, the &quot;Adya Shakti&quot; (primal energy, primordial power), and the essence of the Gayatri mantra.

=== Other texts ===
==== Yoga Sutra ====
The aphoristic verse 1.27 of Pantanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yogasutra&quot; links &quot;Om&quot; to Yoga practice, as follows:
{{poem quote|
{{lang|sa|तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः ॥२७॥}}
His word is Om.
|Yogasutra 1.27}}

Johnston states this verse highlights the importance of &quot;Om&quot; in the meditative practice of yoga, where it symbolises the three worlds in the Self; the three times – past, present, and future eternity; the three divine powers – creation, preservation, and transformation in one Being; and three essences in one Spirit – immortality, omniscience, and joy. It is, asserts Johnston, a symbol for the perfected Spiritual Man.

==== Chaitanya Charitamrita ====
In Krishnava traditions, Krishna is revered as Svayam Bhagavan, the Supreme Lord himself, and &quot;Om&quot; is interpreted in light of this. According to the &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot;, &quot;Om&quot; is the sound representation of the Supreme Lord. &quot;A&quot; is said to represent Bhagavan Krishna (Vishnu), &quot;U&quot; represents Srimati Radharani (Mahalakshmi), and &quot;M&quot; represents jiva, the Self of the devotee.

== Jainism ==

{{see also|Jainism and non-creationism|Jain symbols#Om}}

In Jainism, &quot;Om&quot; is considered a condensed form of reference to the Pañca-Parameṣṭhi by their initials &quot;A+A+A+U+M&quot; (&quot;{{IAST|o3}}{{IAST|m}}&quot;).

The Dravyasamgraha quotes a Prakrit line:{{Sfnp|Von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}

By extension, the Om symbol is also used in Jainism to represent the first five lines of the Namokar mantra, the most important part of the daily prayer in the Jain religion, which honours the {{IAST|Pañca-Parameṣṭhi}}. These five lines are (in English): &quot;(1.) veneration to the Arhats, (2.) veneration to the perfect ones, (3.) veneration to the masters, (4.) veneration to the teachers, (5.) veneration to all the monks in the world&quot;.{{Sfnp|Von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}

== Buddhism ==
&quot;Om&quot; is often used in some later schools of Buddhism, for example Tibetan Buddhism, which was influenced by Hinduism and Tantra.

In East Asian Buddhism, &quot;Om&quot; is often transliterated as the Chinese character {{script|Hant|{{linktext|唵}}}} (pinyin {{transl|zh|ǎn}}) or {{script|Hant|嗡}} (pinyin {{transl|zh|wēng}}).

=== Tibetan Buddhism and Vajrayana ===
In Tibetan Buddhism, &quot;Om&quot; is often placed at the beginning of mantras and dharanis. Probably the most well known mantra is &quot;Om mani padme hum&quot;, the six syllable mantra of the Bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokiteśvara. This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed {{IAST|Ṣaḍākṣarī}} form of Avalokiteśvara. Moreover, as a seed syllable (&quot;Bīja mantra&quot;), &quot;Om&quot; is considered sacred and holy in Esoteric Buddhism.

Some scholars interpret the first word of the mantra {{IAST|oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ}} to be {{IAST|auṃ}}, with a meaning similar to Hinduism – the totality of sound, existence, and consciousness.

{{IAST|Oṃ}} has been described by the 14th Dalai Lama as &quot;composed of three pure letters, A, U, and M. These symbolize the impure body, speech, and mind of everyday unenlightened life of a practitioner; they also symbolize the pure exalted body, speech and mind of an enlightened Buddha&quot;. According to Simpkins, &quot;Om&quot; is a part of many mantras in Tibetan Buddhism and is a symbolism for wholeness, perfection, and the infinite.

=== Japanese Buddhism ===
==== &quot;A-un&quot; ====
{{See also|Om mani padme hum}}
The term {{nihongo|A-un|{{linktext|阿吽}}}} is the transliteration in Japanese of the two syllables &quot;a&quot; and &quot;{{IAST|hūṃ}}&quot;, written in Devanagari as {{script|Deva|अहूँ}}. In Japanese, it is often conflated with the syllable &quot;Om&quot;. The original Sanskrit term is composed of two letters, the first ({{script|Deva|अ}}) and the last ({{script|Deva|ह}}) letters of the Devanagari abugida, with diacritics (including anusvara) on the latter indicating the &quot;-{{IAST|ūṃ}}&quot; of &quot;{{IAST|hūṃ}}&quot;. Together, they symbolically represent the beginning and the end of all things. In Japanese &quot;Mikkyō&quot; Buddhism, the letters represent the beginning and the end of the universe. This is comparable to Alpha and Omega, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, similarly adopted by Christianity to symbolise Christ as the beginning and end of all.

The term &quot;a-un&quot; is used figuratively in some Japanese expressions as {{nihongo|&quot;&quot;a-un&quot; breathing&quot;|阿吽の呼吸|a-un no kokyū}} or {{nihongo|&quot;&quot;a-un&quot; relationship&quot;|阿吽の仲|a-un no naka}}, indicating an inherently harmonious relationship or nonverbal communication.

==== &quot;Niō&quot; guardian kings and &quot;komainu&quot; lion-dogs ====
{{main|Niō|Komainu}}

The term is also used in Buddhist architecture and Shinto to describe the paired statues common in Japanese religious settings, most notably the &quot;Niō&quot; ({{lang|ja|仁王}}) and the &quot;komainu&quot; ({{lang|ja|狛犬}}). One (usually on the right) has an open mouth regarded by Buddhists as symbolically speaking the &quot;A&quot; syllable; the other (usually on the left) has a closed mouth, symbolically speaking the &quot;Un&quot; syllable. The two together are regarded as saying &quot;A-un&quot;. The general name for statues with an open mouth is {{nihongo|&quot;agyō&quot;|阿形||lit. &quot;a&quot; shape}}, that for those with a closed mouth {{nihongo|&quot;ungyō&quot;|吽形||lit. {{&quot;&#x27;}}un&#x27; shape&quot;}}.

Niō statues in Japan, and their equivalent in East Asia, appear in pairs in front of Buddhist temple gates and stupas, in the form of two fierce looking guardian kings (&quot;Vajrapani&quot;).

Komainu, also called lion-dogs, found in Japan, Korea and China, also occur in pairs before Buddhist temples and public spaces, and again, one has an open mouth ({{transl|ja|Agyō}}), the other closed ({{transl|ja|Ungyō}}).

== Sikhism ==
{{Main|Ik Onkar}}
&quot;Ik Onkar&quot; ({{langx|pa|ਇੱਕ ਓਅੰਕਾਰ}}; iconically represented as {{script|Guru|ੴ}}) are the first words of the Mul Mantar, which is the opening verse of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh scripture. Combining the numeral one (&quot;&quot;Ik&quot;) and &quot;Onkar&quot;&quot;, &quot;Ik Onkar&quot; literally means &quot;one &quot;Om &quot;&quot;;{{efn-ua|Quote: &quot;While Ek literally means One, Onkar is the equivalent of the Hindu &quot;Om&quot; (Aum), the one syllable sound representing the holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - the God in His entirety.&quot;}} these words are a statement that there is &quot;one God&quot;, understood to refer to the &quot;absolute monotheistic unity of God&quot; and implying &quot;singularity in spite of the seeming multiplicity of existence&quot;.{{efn-ua|Quote: &quot;the &#x27;a,&#x27; &#x27;u,&#x27; and &#x27;m&#x27; of aum have also been explained as signifying the three principles of creation, sustenance and annihilation. ... aumkār in relation to existence implies plurality, ... but its substitute Ik Onkar definitely implies singularity in spite of the seeming multiplicity of existence. ...&quot;}}

According to Pashaura Singh, &quot;Onkar&quot; is used frequently as invocation in Sikh scripture; it is the foundational word (&quot;shabad&quot;), the seed of Sikh scripture, and the basis of the &quot;whole creation of time and space&quot;.

&quot;Ik Onkar&quot; is a significant name of God in the Guru Granth Sahib and Gurbani, states Kohli, and occurs as &quot;Aum&quot; in the Upanishads and where it is understood as the abstract representation of three worlds (&quot;Trailokya&quot;) of creation.{{efn-ua|Quote: &quot;Ik Aumkara is a significant name in Guru Granth Sahib and appears in the very beginning of Mul Mantra. It occurs as Aum in the Upanishads and in Gurbani, the Onam Akshara (the letter Aum) has been considered as the abstract of three worlds (p. 930). According to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad &quot;Aum&quot; connotes both the transcendent and immanent Brahman.&quot;}} According to Wazir Singh, &quot;Onkar&quot; is a &quot;variation of &quot;Om&quot; (&quot;Aum&quot;) of the ancient Indian scriptures (with a change in its orthography), implying the unifying &quot;seed-force&quot; that evolves as the universe&quot;. Guru Nanak wrote a poem entitled &quot;Onkar&quot; in which, states Doniger, he &quot;attributed the origin and sense of speech to the Divinity, who is thus the Om-maker&quot;.
{{Poem quote|
&quot;Onkar&quot; (&#x27;the Primal Sound&#x27;) created Brahma, &quot;Onkar&quot; fashioned the consciousness,
From &quot;Onkar&quot; came mountains and ages, &quot;Onkar&quot; produced the Vedas,
By the grace of &quot;Onkar&quot;, people were saved through the divine word,
By the grace of &quot;Onkar&quot;, they were liberated through the teachings of the Guru.
|Ramakali Dakkhani|Adi Granth 929-930, Translated by Pashaura Singh}}

&quot;Onkar&quot; is the primordial sound/word. It is the soundless word (&quot;anahat naad&quot; or &quot;anahad naad&quot;). It is both the source as well as manifestation of the source. &quot;Onkar&quot; pervades the entire creation. The soundless sound is present everywhere and inside everything including us. In Sikhism, the Guru Granth Sahib is manifested form of this &quot;Onkar&quot;. Hence, the Guru Granth Sahib is called &quot;Shabad Guru&quot;. Shabad (word) is Guru and Guru itself is the Primordial Sound &quot;Onkar&quot; (God).{{cn|date=June 2023}}

== Thelema ==
For both symbolic and numerological reasons, Aleister Crowley adapted &quot;aum&quot; into a Thelemic magical formula, &quot;AUMGN&quot;, adding a silent &#x27;g&#x27; (as in the word &#x27;gnosis&#x27;) and a nasal &#x27;n&#x27; to the &quot;m&quot; to form the compound letter &#x27;MGN&#x27;; the &#x27;g&#x27; makes explicit the silence previously only implied by the terminal &#x27;m&#x27; while the &#x27;n&#x27; indicates nasal vocalisation connoting the breath of life and together they connote knowledge and generation. Together these letters, &quot;MGN&quot;, have a numerological value of 93, a number with polysemic significance in Thelema. &quot;Om&quot; appears in this extended form throughout Crowley&#x27;s magical and philosophical writings, notably appearing in the &quot;Gnostic Mass&quot;. Crowley discusses its symbolism briefly in section F of &quot;Liber Samekh&quot; and in detail in chapter 7 of &quot;Magick (Book 4)&quot;.

== Modern reception ==
The Brahmic script &quot;Om&quot;-ligature has become widely recognized in Western counterculture since the 1960s, mostly in its standard Devanagari form ({{script|Deva|ॐ}}), but the Tibetan &quot;Om&quot; ({{bo-textonly|ༀ|lang=bo}}) has also gained limited currency in popular culture.

== In meditation ==
{{further|Pranava yoga}}

Meditating and chanting of &quot;Om&quot; can be done by first concentrating on a picture of &quot;Om&quot; and then effortlessly mentally chanting the mantra. Meditating and mental chanting have been said{{by whom|date=February 2022}} to improve the physiological state of the person by increasing alertness and sensory sensitivity.{{Sfn|Kumar|Nagendra|Manjunath|Naveen|2010|pages=2–5}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2022}}

<doc id="228040" wikidata="Q1413725" url="?curid=228040" title="In the Mood">
<text>&quot;In the Mood&quot; is a popular big band-era jazz standard recorded by American bandleader Glenn Miller. &quot;In the Mood&quot; is based on the composition &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot; by Wingy Manone. The first recording under the name &quot;In the Mood&quot; was released by Edgar Hayes &amp; His Orchestra in 1938.

In 1983, the Glenn Miller recording from 1939 was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2004, the recording was inducted into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry which consists of recordings that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

In 1999, National Public Radio (NPR) included the 1939 Glenn Miller recording in its list of &quot;The 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century&quot;.

Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot;, with &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot; on the B-side, became the best-selling swing instrumental.

==Arrangement==
&quot;In the Mood&quot; starts with a saxophone section theme based on repeated arpeggios that are rhythmically displaced; trumpets and trombones add accent riffs. The arrangement has two solo sections: a &quot;tenor fight&quot; or chase solo—in one recording between Tex Beneke and Al Klink—and a 16-bar trumpet solo by Clyde Hurley. At the end of the song, a coda climbs triumphantly, then sounds a sustained unison tonic pitch with a rim shot.

==History==
&quot;In the Mood&quot; was an arrangement by Joe Garland based on an existing melody. Lyrics were added by Andy Razaf. The main theme with repeated arpeggios rhythmically displaced appeared under the title &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot; and was credited to trumpeter Wingy Manone. Manone recorded &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot; on August 28, 1930, in Richmond, Indiana, and released it as a 78 single for Champion Records under the name Barbecue Joe and his Hot Dogs. It was re-released in 1935 by Wingy Manone&#x27;s Orchestra.

Horace Henderson used the same riff in &quot;Hot and Anxious&quot;, which was recorded by his brother Fletcher Henderson on March 19, 1931, for Columbia under the name the Baltimore Bell Hops. Don Redman recorded &quot;Hot and Anxious&quot; for Brunswick in 1932.

Under copyright laws, a tune that had not been written down and registered with the copyright office could be appropriated by any musician with a good ear. Manone raised the similarity between &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot; and &quot;In the Mood&quot; to Joe Garland and to the publisher Shapiro, Bernstein, and Company of New York. Manone also discussed the issue in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine.

&quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot; was copyrighted on November 6, 1941, as a pianoforte version by Peer International.

The first recording of Joe Garland&#x27;s version of &quot;In the Mood&quot; was made by Edgar Hayes and his Orchestra in 1938 with Garland participating. It was released as a B side to their recording of &quot;Stardust&quot; for Decca. On this recording there was a baritone saxophone duet rather than a tenor saxophone battle. The riff had appeared in a 1935 recording by the Mills Blue Rhythm Band entitled &quot;There&#x27;s Rhythm in Harlem&quot;, which had been composed and arranged by Garland. Before offering it to Miller, Garland sold it in 1938 to Artie Shaw, who chose not to record it because the original arrangement was too long, but he did perform it in concert.

Artie Shaw&#x27;s version was over six minutes long and met a lackluster audience response. Jerry Gray arranged Shaw&#x27;s version. The band later performed a shorter version. The Hayes recording was over three minutes in length to fit on one side of a 78 record.

The song was sold in 1939 to Glenn Miller, who experimented with the arrangement. The author of the final arrangement is unknown. One possibility is Eddie Durham because he wrote other arrangements on the same day that &quot;In the Mood&quot; was recorded. Other possibilities include pianist Chummy MacGregor, who was Miller&#x27;s chief arranger, John Chalmers, and Miller himself. According to an account by MacGregor, &quot;all they used of the original arrangement were the two front saxophone strains and another part that occurred later on in the arrangement.&quot; Both MacGregor and Miller were involved in creating the final arrangement: &quot;MacGregor mentioned that additional solos were added to the original arrangement and he wrote the finishing coda. Miller probably edited some of the arrangement along with MacGregor.&quot; In its final form, it is an example of Hemiola rhythm.

Two copyrights were filed by Joseph Copeland Garland on June 8 and November 26, 1938, before the song was published by Lewis Music Pub. Co., Inc. on October 31, 1939, with Joe Garland the lone songwriter. Then on November 27, a copyright was filed with both Garland and Razaf by Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. of New York. A final copyright was filed by Shapiro, Bernstein on December 11, 1939, worded as follows: &quot;In the mood; fox-trot, Andy Razaf &amp; Joe Garland, arr. Joe Garland as suggested by Glenn Miller; orch. pts., with w.&quot;

Two editions of the sheet music are in circulation. The 1939 publication credited to Garland and Razaf is in A♭ and has lyrics beginning: &quot;Mister What-cha-call-em, what-cha doin&#x27; tonight?&quot; These lyrics were used in the 1952 recording by The Andrews Sisters, which is perhaps the best-known vocal version of the number. The 1960 reprint credited only to Garland (with piano arrangement by Robert C. Haring) is in G and has lyrics beginning: &quot;Who&#x27;s the livin&#x27; dolly with the beautiful eyes?&quot;

On August 1, 1939, Miller&#x27;s version was recorded at the RCA Victor Studios at 155 East 24th Street in New York City. The personnel on Miller&#x27;s recording included Al Mastren and Paul Tanner on trombone; Clyde Hurley, Legh Knowles, and Dale McMickle on trumpet; Wilbur Schwartz on clarinet; Hal McIntyre on alto saxophone; Tex Beneke, Al Klink, and Harold Tennyson on tenor saxophone; Chummy MacGregor on piano; Richard Fisher on guitar; Rowland Bundock on double bass; and Moe Purtill on drums.

==Other versions==

In February 1944, the Glenn Miller RCA Victor Bluebird 1939 studio recording of &quot;In the Mood&quot; was released as a V-Disc, one of a series of recordings sent free by the U.S. War Department to overseas military personnel during World War II. A second version recorded by Glenn Miller&#x27;s Overseas Band in 1945, was released in May 1948. A new recording by Glenn Miller with the American Band of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was broadcast to Germany in 1944 on the radio program &quot;The Wehrmacht Hour&quot;.

This piece of music was not new in Europe. The first Swiss record of &quot;In the Mood&quot; were released in April 1940 by &quot;Teddy Stauffer und seine Original Teddies&quot; in Zurich. Another interpretation was made by Ernst van &#x27;t Hoff in February 1941 in Berlin.

In 1951 a Ferranti Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester played &quot;In the Mood&quot;, one of the first songs to be played by a computer, and the oldest known recording of digitally generated music.

In December 1959, the rendition of &quot;In the Mood&quot; that Ernie Fields and his Orchestra recorded peaked at number 4 by means of the &quot;Billboard&quot; popular hit parade and number 7 by means of both the Rhythm and Blues and the &quot;Cash Box&quot; hit parades.

Jerry Lee Lewis, under the alias of The Hawk, recorded an instrumental version of &quot;In the Mood&quot; in 1959. For contractual reasons, the track was released in the USA on the Phillips label, a subsidiary of the Sun Records label owned by Sam Phillips.

Bette Midler covered the song on her album &quot;The Divine Miss M&quot; in 1973, with additional lyrics by herself and Barry Manilow. It was released as a single in 1974 and reached #51 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Jonathan King, under the name Sound 9418 released his version in 1976 which reached No. 46 on the UK Singles Chart.

In the winter of 1977, a novelty version by the Henhouse Five Plus Too (a Ray Stevens project) employing the sounds of clucking chickens entered the U.S. Pop Top 40: (&quot;Billboard&quot; No. 40, &quot;Cash Box&quot; #37).

Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers prominently featured &quot;In the Mood&quot; as part of their hit medley &quot;Swing the Mood&quot;, which was a #1 single in the UK in 1989 and reached #11 in the US in 1990.

John Lee Hooker said that &quot;In the Mood&quot; was the inspiration for his song &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood&quot; which became a No. 1 hit on the R&amp;B Singles chart.

<text>Campsite, campground, and camping pitch are all related terms regarding a place used for camping (an overnight stay in an outdoor area). The usage differs between British English and American English.

In British English, a &quot;campsite&quot; is an area, usually divided into a number of &quot;camping pitches&quot;, where people can camp overnight using tents, campervans or caravans. In the &quot;US&quot;, the expression used is &quot;campground&quot; and not &quot;campsite&quot;. In American English, the term &quot;campsite&quot; generally means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch a tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites.

There are two types of campsites (&quot;US&quot;) or pitches (&quot;UK&quot;): one, a designated area with various facilities; or two, an impromptu area (as one might decide to stop while backpacking or hiking, or simply adjacent to a road through the wilderness).

==Campgrounds==


The term &#x27;camp&#x27; comes from the Latin word &quot;campus&quot;, meaning &quot;field&quot;. Therefore, a campground typically consists of open areas where a camper can pitch a tent or park a camper. More specifically, a campsite is a designated area set aside for camping, often requiring a user fee. Campsites typically feature a few (but sometimes no) improvements.

Dedicated campsites, known as &quot;campgrounds&quot;, usually have some amenities. Common amenities include, listed roughly in order from most to least common:
* Fireplaces or fire pits in which to build campfires (this can be a circle of rocks, a metal enclosure, a metal grate, a concrete spot, or even just a hole).
* Road access for vehicles
* A gravel or concrete pad on which to park a vehicle
* Picnic tables
* Marked spaces indicating a boundary for one camper or a group of campers
* Reservations to ensure there will be available space to camp
* Utility hookups, such as electricity, water, and sewer, primarily for the use of travel trailers, recreational vehicles, or similar
* Raised platforms on which to set up tents
* Piped potable water

Campgrounds may include further amenities:
* Pit toilets (outhouses)
* Flush toilets and showers
* Sinks and mirrors in the bathrooms
* A small convenience store
* Shower facilities (with or without hot water)
* Wood for free or for sale for use in cooking or for a campfire
* Garbage cans or large rubbish bins in which to place refuse

Camping outside a designated campsite may be forbidden by law. It is thought to be a nuisance, harmful to the environment, and is often associated with vagrancy. However some countries have specific laws and/or regulations allowing camping on public lands (see &quot;Freedom to roam&quot;). In the United States, many national and state parks have dedicated campsites and sometimes also allow impromptu backcountry camping by visitors. U.S. National Forests often have established campsites, but generally allow camping anywhere, except within a certain distance of water sources or developed areas. Camping may also be prohibited in certain ‘special areas’ of national forests containing unusual landforms or vegetation. And if conditions allow campfires, a campfire permit is required for campfires outside of developed campsites.

In Britain, it is more commonly known as &quot;wild camping&quot;, and is mostly illegal. However, Scotland has a relaxed view and wild camping is legal in most of Scotland.

In many parts of Canada, &quot;roughing it&quot; or &quot;dormir a la belle etoile&quot; (French) is considered to be wilderness camping on government owned, public land known as crown land and commonly called &quot;the bush&quot;. There are no amenities of any kind and typically no development except for possibly logging roads or ATV trails, and few rules beyond the requirement in some provinces to move the site at least 100 metres every 21 days.

===RV parks/caravan parks===
In North America many campgrounds have facilities for Recreational Vehicles and are also known as RV parks. Similar facilities in the UK are known as Caravan Parks. The Kampgrounds of America (KOA) is a large chain of commercial campgrounds located throughout the United States and Canada.

Both commercial and governmental campgrounds typically charge a nominal fee for the privilege of camping there, to cover expenses, and in the case of an independent campground, to make a profit. However, there are some in North America that do not charge a use fee and rely on sources such as donations and tax dollars. Staying the night in a big-box store parking lot is also common (called &quot;boondocking&quot;), and some retailers welcome RVs to their parking lots.

===Trailer parks===
Frequently confused with campsites, campgrounds and RV parks, trailer parks are made up of long term or semi-permanent residents occupying mobile homes, park trailers or RVs.

===Holiday park===

The holiday park is a United Kingdom version of the North American trailer park. Created to allow coastal resorts to enable temporary and high-income accommodation to be easily created, under UK planning laws, no residents are permanent, and the park must be wholly shut to all for at least two months each year. All of the mobile homes are either available for rent from the land owner, or pitches are leased on a long-term basis from the land owner and the lease&#x27;s own mobile home placed on the pitch. Permanent sites owners lease includes the provision by the land owner of water, sewerage and general site and grounds maintenance. Some holiday parks includes a small campsite for those touring the area, where they can pay to pitch tents or site touring caravans and motorhomes. Touring campsites have full access to the Holiday parks facilities, including clothes washing and showering. Most holiday parks include a central entertainments block, which can include a shop, restaurants, and a multi-purpose theatre used for both stage and activity-based entertainment.

=== Types of holiday park accommodation in the UK===
;Caravan Holiday Homes

Holiday parks vary in size and type, as do the kinds of accommodation available within them. Caravans are a popular choice with holiday makers, and modern varieties come complete with features like double glazing and central heating, cookers, fridges, showers, hot/cold water supplies, electricity and gas mains input. A standard caravan is a single unit, built to a maximum of 14 feet wide.

Other types of mobile home include Lodges and Park Homes which are more expensive than caravans and offer more luxurious features. Higher end Lodges can be built using some of the same methods as traditional bricks and mortar buildings and include familiar materials like plasterboard and tongue and groove walls for an end result that&#x27;s very similar to a standard house. A standard lodge uses similar materials as a standard caravan such as wood, gypsum board and plywood where the main difference being the extra width. Lodges and Parkhomes can come in sizes up to 22 feet wide and 45 feet long, making them a popular choice with big families and large groups.

Holiday homes can be rented on an ad-hoc basis or purchased – caravans can be purchased from around £30,000 while park homes and lodges can cost between £100,000 and £500,000.

Once purchased, holiday homes have various ongoing costs including insurance, site fees, local authority rates, utility charges, winterisation and depreciation. Depending on the holiday home and the park these costs can range from £1,000 to £40,000 per year.

===Certificated and Certified Locations===
Certificated and Certified Locations are smaller privately owned caravan sites which have to be approved by the UK based Camping and Caravanning Club, The Caravan Club, and other organisations). These campsites are normally reserved exclusively for Club members. These smaller campsites are allowed to operate under The Public Health Act 1936 and The Caravan and Control of Development Act 1960.

==Backcountry camping==
In the U.S., &quot;backcountry&quot; or &quot;dispersed&quot; camping is common in large undeveloped protected areas. These areas can only be reached on foot, bicycle, canoe or on horseback. The camping areas are usually established campsites or &quot;zones&quot;, which have a predetermined maximum number of persons that are allowed to stay in the section per night. Strict regulations are imposed regarding food storage and resource protection. Usually in organized parks or wilderness areas, backcountry campsites require a permit, which may be free, obtainable at visitor centers and ranger stations. Backcountry camping in other areas may not require a permit.

Canadians refer to it as crownland camping, or rough camping. Canadian citizens and people who have lived in Canada for at least seven months of the preceding 12-month period can camp for free up to 21 days on any one site in a calendar year. This ensures sites are available to others and helps reduce environmental impacts. The Crownland Atlas (map) provides usage designations and several web pages (map) or blogs provide more details about specific sites.

==History==

===United States===
As with camping, campgrounds predated the automobile. When President Theodore Roosevelt addressed Congress in 1901, he called for the creation of free campgrounds on Federal lands. Already four national parks—Yellowstone, Sequoia, Yosemite, and Mount Rainier—were established and by the time Congress formally established the National Park Service in 1916, America had a dozen national parks.

While a handful of campgrounds, both public and private, could be found at tourist destinations, as late as 1936 it was still difficult to find places to stop along the route to these parks. Instead, it was common for motorists to pull off the road and set up camp on private property. This practice not only reinforced the negative, nomadic image of RV travelers, it was a detriment to expanding the trailer market. The Trailer Coach Manufacturers Association began to lobby states to establish sanitation standards and worked with civic and business leaders to establish additional campgrounds, emphasizing the economic benefits of a campground in their community. The Denver Civic Association wrote that a campground was just as essential to a town as a railway station. The trailer industry&#x27;s efforts were effective. The number of campgrounds in the Trailer Travel Magazine&#x27;s directory of campgrounds doubled to 1,650 by the end of 1936 and promised to double again by the end of 1937.

The campgrounds themselves also changed. Martin Hogue wrote, “The first public campgrounds in the United States were nothing more than large, dedicated clearings, free of trees, within which to concentrate groups of tourists.” A plant pathologist named Emilio Meinecke, was commissioned to study the effect of motor tourism in the Redwoods in 1929. Meinicke&#x27;s recommendations explained that instead of allowing campers to park haphazardly within a park, the camper&#x27;s impact on the environment could be minimized through campground roads forming a one-way loop leading to individual parking spurs next to each campsite. Although he would later continue to write of the effect of campers on nature, submitting a memorandum to the National Forest Service in 1935 entitled “The Trailer Menace,” he had established the basic design for campgrounds still used today.

<text>The Deutsches Museum (&quot;German Museum&quot;, officially (English: &quot;German Museum of Masterpieces of Science and Technology&quot;)) in Munich, Germany, is the world&#x27;s largest museum of science and technology, with about 125,000 exhibited objects from 50 fields of science and technology. It receives about 1.5 million visitors per year.

The museum was founded on 28 June 1903, at a meeting of the Association of German Engineers (VDI) as an initiative of Oskar von Miller. It is the largest museum in Munich. For a period of time the museum was also used to host pop and rock concerts including The Who, Jimi Hendrix and Elton John.

== Museumsinsel ==

The main site of the Deutsches Museum is a small island in the Isar river, which had been used for rafting wood since the Middle Ages. The island did not have any buildings before 1772 because it was regularly flooded prior to the building of the Sylvensteinspeicher.

In 1772 the Isar barracks were built on the island and, after the flooding of 1899, the buildings were rebuilt with flood protection. In 1903 the city council announced that they would donate the island for the newly built Deutsches Museum. The island formerly known as Kohleninsel (coal island) was then renamed Museumsinsel.

== Other sites ==
In addition to the main site on the &quot;Museumsinsel&quot;, the museum has two branches in and near Munich, one in Bonn, and one in Nuremberg.

The Flugwerft Schleißheim branch is located some 18 kilometres (11 miles) north of Munich&#x27;s city centre close to Schleißheim Palace. It is based on the premises of one of the first military airbases in Germany founded just before World War I. It comprises the old air control and command centre as well as modern buildings added in the late 2000s after strong endorsement from Franz Josef Strauß, former prime minister of the state of Bavaria (1978 to 1988), who was a passionate flyer.
The Flugwerft Schleißheim displays various interesting airplanes for which there was insufficient room at the Museumsinsel site in downtown Munich, and also several which were moved from their former places in the main museum. Among the more prominent exhibits is a Horten flying wing glider built in the 1940s, restored from the few surviving parts. A collection of the German constructions of VTOL (vertical take off and landing) planes developed in the 1950s and 1960s is unique. A range of Vietnam era fighter planes as well as Russian planes taken over from East Germany after the reunification are on display. This outstation also features a workshop dedicated to the restoration of all types of airplanes intended for static display.

In 2003, the Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum was opened. Located at Theresienhöhe in Munich it focuses on transportation technology.

The branch located in Bonn was opened in 1995 and focuses on German technology, science and research after 1945.

The latest opening of a branch was the Deutsches Museum Nuremberg - &quot;Das Zukunftsmuseum&quot;, in September 2021. It focuses on future technology and its impact on humans and society. 
== Oskar von Miller ==
Oskar von Miller studied electrical engineering and is otherwise known for building the first high voltage line from Miesbach to Munich (57 km) in 1882 for the electrical technology exhibition at the Glaspalast in Munich. In 1883 he joined AEG and founded an engineering office in Munich. The Frankfurt electricity exhibition in 1891 and several power plants contributed to the reputation of Oskar von Miller. In the early years, the exhibition and the collection of the Deutsches Museum were strongly influenced personally by Oskar von Miller.

== History ==
A few months before the 1903 meeting of the Society of German Engineers, Oskar von Miller gathered a small group who supported his desire to found a science and technology museum. In a showing of support this group spontaneously donated 260,000 marks to the cause and elected a &quot;Provisional Committee&quot; to get the ball rolling.
In June 1903, Prince Ludwig agreed to act as patron of the museum and the city of Munich donated Coal Island as a site for the project. In addition, exhibits began to arrive from Munich, Germany, and abroad including collections from the Bavarian Academy. As no dedicated museum building existed, the exhibits were displayed in the National Museum.

On 12 November 1906, the temporary exhibits at the National Museum were ceremonially opened to the public and on November 13 the foundation stone was laid for the permanent museum.

The first name of the museum, the &quot;German Museum for Masterpieces of Natural Science and Technology&quot;, was not meant to limit the museum to German advances in science and technology, but to express the importance of science and technology to the German people.

Oskar von Miller opened the new museum on his 70th birthday, 2 May 1925, after a delay of almost ten years. From the beginning, the museum displays are backed up by documents available in a public library and archives, which are open seven days a week to ensure access to the working public.
Before and during World War II the museum was put on a shoestring budget by the Nazi party and many exhibits were allowed to get out of date with a few exceptions such as the new automobile room dedicated on 7 May 1937. By the end of 1944 the museum was badly damaged by air bombings with 80% of the buildings and 20% of the exhibits damaged or destroyed. As Allied troops marched into Munich in April 1945, museum director, Karl Bässler, barely managed to keep the last standing bridge to Museum Island from being blown up by retreating German troops.

Following the war the museum had to be closed for repairs and temporary tenants, such as the College of Technology and the Post Office used museum space as their own buildings were being reconstructed. The Museum was also home to the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews, representing Jewish displaced persons in the American Zone of Germany after the war, as well as to UNRRA that operated a camp for displaced persons and later an International University with over 2000 students.

In November 1945, the library was able to reopen, followed by the congress hall in January 1946. A special exhibit on fifty years of the Diesel engine opened in October 1947 and the regular exhibits began reopening in May 1948. Not until 1965, more than twenty years after the end of the war in Germany, did the exhibit area match (and then exceed) pre-war size.

During the 1950s, the museum focused on natural sciences rather than technology and many of the traditional large exhibits, such as civil engineering, were reduced in size to make way for more modern technological advances.


At a speech on the donation of a Opel RAK2 rocket-car replica to the Deutsches Museum, rocket pioneer Fritz von Opel summarized the history of rocketry (&quot;Ein Pionier des Raketenantriebs berichtet&quot;, April 3, 1968) beginning with ancient rocket technologies over the world&#x27;s first rocket program Opel RAK, initiated by Max Valier, Friedrich Wilhelm Sander and himself, to NASA&#x27;s space missions of the 1960s. In August 1969, the Apollo 8 space capsule was shown in a special exhibit entitled &quot;Man and Space&quot; and in 1970 the first full-time director, Theo Stillger, was appointed. In the 1970s the mission statement of the museum was modified to encourage the explanation of the cultural significance of science and technology in exhibits.

The early 1980s saw severe damage to several exhibits due to arson resulting in the smallest exhibit space of 34,140 square meters (8½ acres). This was followed by an extensive reconstruction effort and additional building bringing the total exhibit space to 55,000 square meters (13½ acres) by 1993. The 1980s and &#x27;90s also brought agreements with the Science Centre in Bonn and the government resulting in the creation of Deutsches Museum Bonn and the Flugwerft Schleißheim airfield exhibit.

In 1996, the Bavarian Government gave buildings at the historic Theresienhöhe site in Munich to the Deutsches Museum resulting in the creation of the new transportation museum, the Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum, which opened in 2003 and now houses the road vehicle and train exhibits that were removed from the original Deutsches Museum site. The Theresienhöhe quarter is a new area on the edge of the inner city of Munich, and the Museum of Transport is a part of the quarter&#x27;s design of mixed use.

<text>Human communication, or anthroposemiotics, is a field of study dedicated to understanding how humans communicate. Humans&#x27; ability to communicate with one another would not be possible without an understanding of what we are referencing or thinking about. Because humans are unable to fully understand one another&#x27;s perspective, there needs to be a creation of commonality through a shared mindset or viewpoint. The field of communication is very diverse, as there are multiple layers of what communication is and how we use its different features as human beings.

Humans have communicatory abilities other animals do not. For example, humans are able to communicate about time and place as though they are solid objects. Humans communicate to request help, inform others, and share attitudes for bonding. Communication is a joint activity largely dependent on the ability to maintain common attention. We share relevant background knowledge and joint experience in order to communicate content and coherence in exchanges. Most face-to-face communication requires visually reading and following along with the other person, offering gestures in reply, and maintaining eye contact throughout the interaction.

==Category==
The current study of human communication can be branched off into two major categories; rhetorical and relational. The focus of rhetorical communication is primarily on the study of influence; the art of rhetorical communication is based on the idea of persuasion. The relational approach examines communication from a transactional perspective; two or more people interact to reach an agreed perspective.

In its early stages, rhetoric was developed to help ordinary people prove their claims in court; this shows how persuasion is key in this form of communication. Aristotle stated that effective rhetoric is based on argumentation. As explained in the text, rhetoric involves a dominant party and a submissive party or a party that succumbs to that of the most dominant party. While the rhetorical approach stems from Western societies, the relational approach stems from Eastern societies. Eastern societies hold higher standards for cooperation, which makes sense as to why they would sway more toward a relational approach for that matter. &quot;Maintaining valued relationships is generally seen as more important than exerting influence and control over others&quot;. &quot;The study of human communication today is more diversified than ever before in its history&quot;.

Classification of human communication can be found in the workplace, especially for group work. Co-workers need to argue with each other to gain the best solutions for their projects, while they also need to nurture their relationships to maintain their collaboration. For example, in their group work, they may use the communication tactic of &quot;saving face&quot;.

Spoken language involves speech, mostly human quality to acquire. For example, chimpanzees are humans&#x27; closest relatives, but they are unable to produce speech. Chimpanzees are the closest living species to humans. Chimpanzees are closer to humans, in genetic and evolutionary terms, than they are to gorillas or other apes. The fact that a chimpanzee will not acquire speech, even when raised in a human home with all the environmental input of a normal human child, is one of the central puzzles we face when contemplating the biology of our species. In repeated experiments, starting in the 1910s, chimpanzees raised in close contact with humans have universally failed to speak, or even to try to speak, despite their rapid progress in many other intellectual and motor domains. Each normal human is born with a capacity to rapidly and unerringly acquire their mother tongue, with little explicit teaching or coaching. In contrast, no nonhuman primate has spontaneously produced even a word of the local language.

==Definition==
Human communication can be defined as any Shared Symbolic Interaction.
* Shared, because each communication process also requires a system of signification (the Code) as its necessary condition, and if the encoding is not known to all those who are involved in the communication process, there is no understanding and therefore fails the same notification. 
* Symbolic, because there is a need for a signifier or sign, which allows the transmission of the message.
* Interaction, since it involves two or more people, resulting in a further increase of knowledge on the part of all those who interact.

==Types==
Human communication can be subdivided into a variety of types:
* Intrapersonal communication (communication with oneself): This very basic form of information, is the standard and foundation, of all things communication. This communication with ourselves showcases the process in which we think on our previous and ongoing actions, as well as what we choose to understand from other types of communications and events. Our intrapersonal communication, may be shown and expressed to others by our reactions to certain outcomes, through simple acts of gestures and expressions.
* Interpersonal communication (communication between two or more people) - Communication relies heavily on understanding the processes and situations that you are in, in order to communicate effectively. It is more than simple behaviors and strategies, on how and what it means to communicate with another person. Interpersonal communication reflects the personality and characteristics, of a person, seen through the type of dialect, form, and content, a person chooses to communicate with. As simple as this is, interpersonal communication can only be correctly done if both persons involved in the communication, understand what it is to be human beings, and share similar qualities of what it means to be humans. It involves acts of trust and openness, as well as a sense of respect and care towards what the other person is talking about.
** Nonverbal communication: The messages we send to each other, in ways that cover the act of word-by-mouth. These actions may be done through the use of our facial features and expressions, arms and hands, the tone of our voice, or even our very appearance can display a certain type of message.
** Speech: Allowing words to make for an understanding as to what people are feeling and expressing. It allows a person to get a direct thought out to another by using their voice to create words that then turn into a sentence, which in turn then turns into a conversation to get a message across. &quot;What is spoken or expressed, as in conversation; uttered or written words: seditious speech. A talk or public address, or a written copy of this: The senator gave a speech. The language or dialect of a nation or region: American speech. One&#x27;s manner or style of speaking: the mayor&#x27;s mumbling speech. The study of oral communication, speech sounds, and vocal physiology&quot;.
** Conversation: Allows however many people to say words back and forth to each other that will equal into a meaningful rhythm called conversation. It defines ideas between people, teams, or groups. To have a conversation requires at least two people, making it possible to share the values and interests of each person. Conversation makes it possible to get messages across to other people, whether that be an important message or just a simple message. &quot;Strong conversation skills will virtually guarantee that you will be better understood by most people&quot; 
** Visual communication: The type of communication where it involves using your eyes that allow you to read signs, charts, graphs, and pictures that have words or phrases and or pictures showing and describing what needs to be portrayed to get information across. Using visual communication allows for people to live daily lives without constantly needing to speak. A simple example is driving in a car and seeing a red sign that says &quot;stop&quot; on it; as a driver, you are using visual communication to read the sign understand what is being said and stop your car to not get into an accident. &quot;If carried out properly, visual communication has various benefits. In the information era and fast-paced society in which time is limited, visual communication help to communicate ideas faster and better. Generally speaking, it offers these benefits: instant conveyance, ease of understanding, cross-cultural communication and generation of enjoyment&quot;.
** Writing: What I am forming together right now is called writing where it revolves around putting words together to create a sentence that flows into a sentence of meaning. Words are letters that are put together to transform a word that allows the person to understand and follow along with what is being portrayed. Writing requires us to use our hands and paper to form words and letters to create the flow of a message or conversation. Writing can also be done in the form of typing which is what you are seeing here, forming words together on a computer. &quot;Writing&quot; is the process of using symbols (letters of the alphabet, punctuation, and spaces) to communicate thoughts and ideas in a readable form&quot;.
** Mail: This is in the form of postage which is in a letter or package. When someone uses the post office service requiring them to send a letter that they wrote with pencil and paper or they are using the postage service to send an object to someone out of state. Makes for an easier process to send a loved one messages or objects that do not live next to you or within a 20 min drive distance. &quot;Material (such as letters and packages) sent or carried in a postal system&quot;. For an example a loved one is in the military and is out of state, to let them know what is going on in your life and to also ask how they are doing you send them a letter via the postal service to get that message to them at their location. Workers at the postal service get the letters and packages across states and countries.
** Mass media: &quot;The means of communication reaching a large number of people such as the population of a nation through certain channels like film, radio, books, music, or television in that the consumer participation stays passive with comparison to interactive network platforms&quot;. The television allows for getting messages to a lot of people in different locations in a matter of minutes making it for the fastest communication skill.
** Telecommunication: A style of communication that allows humans to understand conversation, speech, and or visual communication through technology. Whether you are listening to the radio, using your eyes to watch television, or reading words in an email that is Telecommunication. This type of communication allows for a faster and more efficient process for a message to get across to another one from anywhere you are. Location is not a problem for this type of communication. &quot;The transmission media in telecommunication have evolved through numerous stages of technology, from beacons and other visual signals (such as smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs), to electrical cable and electromagnetic radiation, including light. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels, which afford the advantages of multiplexing multiple concurrent communication sessions. &quot;Telecommunication&quot; is often used in its plural form&quot;.
* Organizational communication (communication within organizations): Defined by structure and planning, making words, phrases, and images flow into direction and meaning. &quot;The construct of organizational communication structure is defined by its 5 main dimensions: relationships, entities, contexts, configuration, and temporal stability&quot;. Making it easier to work into groups of different culture and thoughts.
* Mass communication: This type of communication involves the process of communicating with known and unknown audiences, through the use of technology or other mediums. There is hardly ever an opportunity for the audience to respond directly to those who sent the message, there is a divide/separation between the sender and receiver. There are typically four players in the process of mass communication, these players are those who send the message, the message itself, the medium in which the message is sent, and those who receive the message. These four components come together to be the communication we see and are a part of the most, as the media helps in distributing these messages to the world every day.
* Group dynamics (communication within groups): Allows ideas to be created within a group of people, allowing many minds to think together to form and create meaning. &quot;The interactions that influence the attitudes and behavior of people when they are grouped with others through either choice or accidental circumstances&quot;.
* Cross-cultural communication (communication across cultures): This allows different people from different locations, gender, and culture, in a group to feed off of each other&#x27;s ideas to form something much bigger and better. &quot;Culture is a way of thinking and living whereby one picks up a set of attitudes, values, norms, and beliefs that are taught and reinforced by other members in the group&quot;.

== Face-to-Face Communication ==
Face-to-face interaction is social communication carried out with other present individuals without any mediating technology. It is defined as the mutual influence of individuals’ direct physical presence with their body language and verbal language. It is one of the basic elements of a social system, forming a significant part of socialization and experience throughout an individual&#x27;s lifetime. It is also central to the development of groups and organizations composed of those individuals. Face-to-face interaction not only allows people to communicate more directly, but has been shown to improve mental health and can reduce various mental illnesses, most commonly, depression and anxiety.

=== Studies on Face-to-Face Communication ===
Most research and studies on face-to-face interaction is done via direct observation; the goal is to explain the regularities in the actions observed in these interactions. The study of face-to-face interaction examines its organization, rules, and strategy. It has been of interest to scholars since at least the early 20th century. One of the earliest social science scholars to analyze this type of interaction was sociologist Georg Simmel. He defined a society as a number of individuals intertwined by various interactions. In his 1908 book, he observed that sensory organs play an important role in interaction, discussing examples of human behavior such as eye contact. His insights were soon developed by others, including Charles Cooley and George Herbert Mead. Their theories became known as symbolic interactionism; and have since opened the door to a variety and wide range of other theories. Symbolic interactionists are more concerned with subjective meaning rather than objective structure. They focus on how individuals interpret subjective meaning, which leads them to understand how that individual views the world as well as how the repetition of meaningful interactions among individuals is the groundwork to define the formation of society. By the mid-20th century, there was already a sizable scholarly literature on various aspects of face-to-face interaction. Works on this topic have been published by scholars such as Erving Goffman and Eliot Chapple.

=== Mediated Communication ===
Historically, mediated communication was much rarer than face-to-face. Even though humans have possessed the technology to communicate in space and time (e.g. writing) for millennia, the majority of the world&#x27;s population lacked the necessary skills, such as literacy, to use them. This began to change with the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg that led to the spread of printed texts and rising literacy in Europe from the 15th century. Since then, face-to-face interaction has begun to steadily lose ground to mediated communication.

=== Compared with Mediated Communication ===
Face-to-face communication has been however described as less preferable to mediated communication in some situations, particularly where time and geographical distance are an issue. For example, in maintaining a long-distance friendship, face-to-face communication was only the fourth most common way of maintaining ties, after telephone, email, and instant messaging.

Despite the advent of many new information and communication technologies, face-to-face interaction is still widespread and popular and has a better performance in many different areas. Nardi and Whittaker (2002) pointed that face-to-face communication is still the golden standard among the mediated technologies based on many theorists, particularly in the context of the media richness theory where face-to-face communication is described as the most efficient and informational one. This is explained because face-to-face communication engages more human senses than mediated communication. Face-to-face interaction is also a useful way for people when they want to win over others based on verbal communication, or when they try to settle disagreements. Besides, it does help a lot for teachers as one effective teaching method. It is also easier to keep a stronger and more active political connection with others by face-to-face interaction.

In the end, there are both pros and cons to each form of communication. Several studies compared the two groups in order to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each. One group was communicating only through face-to-face communication, while the other was communicating only through computer-mediated communication. These studies found that computer-mediated groups perform better than face-to-face groups on idea generation tasks, while face-to-face groups excel in social emotional exchange. This is because face-to-face groups have more tension release and agreement statements, while computer-mediated groups have a tendency of giving more suggestions, opinions, and formal expressions. There is a greater equality of participation in computer-mediated groups, but there&#x27;s also a higher rate of uninhibited behaviour because computer-mediated groups induce a greater loss of self-awareness. There is generally a reduced sense of social pressure in computer-mediated groups, but there is a stronger perception and sense of understanding in face-to-face groups.

=== Face-to-Face Interactions Versus Social Media ===
Talking to someone face to face gives a person non-verbal cues, such as smiling, physical movement, and body positions that help people communicate. However, since social media lacks face-to-face communication, some individuals have adapted to blind communication when speaking online, seen through texting, commenting, and sending/receiving messages.

By nature, humans are social. Social interaction is essential to survival. With recent advances in technology, such as the Internet, instant messaging, and smartphones, forms many channels and ways to interact with others. However, the human brain has evolved to adapt and keep up with this flood of mass communication. While face-to-face communication is predicted to improve quality of life, Internet and social media communication did not. The Internet opens a new realm of possibilities in connecting with people around the globe with inherent factors in online communication that limit its ability to promote the same level of social satisfaction as traditional face-to-face communication. There are significant differences between online and face-to-face communication, leading to online communication being less emotionally satisfying and fulfilling than face-to-face communication. Social interaction on the internet and through social media platforms makes the interaction considerably difficult to distinguish nonverbal cues. Transitive memory development is also brought by face-to-face communication, which is more effective than online communication.

While technology has been able to bring communities and people closer together, humans have a responsibility to cultivate those connections and nurture them through old-fashioned face-to-face communication. As a human species, continuing to connect with others without hiding behind electronic screens is crucial.

=== Cross Multicultures ===

Although there are increasingly virtual communications in large transnational companies with the development of Internet, face-to-face interaction is still a crucial tool in communication between employees and staff workers. Face-to-face interaction is beneficial to understand underlying truths that are presented through emotion and body language, especially when there are language and cultural differences present amongst individuals.

Cooperation in a multicultural team requires knowledge sharing. Ambiguous knowledge which arises frequently in a multicultural team is inevitable because of the different language habits. Face-to-face communication is better than other virtual communications for the ambiguous information. The reason is that face-to-face communication can provide non-verbal messages including gestures, eye contact, touch, and body movement. However, the virtual communications, such as email, only have verbal information which will make team members more misunderstanding of the knowledge due to their different comprehension of the same words. On the other hand, the understanding of professional standards shows no difference between face-to-face interaction and virtual communications.

Van der Zwaard and Bannink (2014) examined the effect of video call compared with face-to-face communication on the negotiation of meaning between native speakers and non-native speakers of English. Face-to-face interaction provides individuals who use English as the second language both intentional and unintentional actions which could enhance the comprehension of the chat in English. Individuals are more honest in understanding when they are in face-to-face interaction than in video call due to the potential loss of face issues for the non-native language speakers during the video call. As a result, face-to-face interaction has a more positive influence on the negotiation of meaning than virtual communications such as the video call.

<text>Intrapersonal communication (also known as autocommunication or inner speech) is communication with oneself or self-to-self communication. Examples are thinking to oneself &quot;I will do better next time&quot; after having made a mistake or imagining a conversation with one&#x27;s boss in preparation for leaving work early. It is often understood as an exchange of messages in which sender and receiver are the same person. Some theorists use a wider definition that goes beyond message-based accounts and focuses on the role of meaning and making sense of things. Intrapersonal communication can happen alone or in social situations. It may be prompted internally or occur as a response to changes in the environment.

Intrapersonal communication encompasses a great variety of phenomena. A central type happens purely internally as an exchange within one&#x27;s mind. Some researchers see this as the only form. In a wider sense, however, there are also types of self-to-self communication that are mediated through external means, like when writing a diary or a shopping list for oneself. For verbal intrapersonal communication, messages are formulated using a language, in contrast to non-verbal forms sometimes used in imagination and memory. One contrast among inner verbal forms is between self-talk and inner dialogue. Self-talk involves only one voice talking to itself. For inner dialogue, several voices linked to different positions take turns in a form of imaginary interaction. Other phenomena related to intrapersonal communication include planning, problem-solving, perception, reasoning, self-persuasion, introspection, and dreaming.

Models of intrapersonal communication discuss which components are involved and how they interact. Many models hold that the process starts with the perception and interpretation of internal and external stimuli or cues. Later steps involve the symbolic encoding of a message that becomes a new stimulus. Some models identify the same self as sender and receiver. Others see the self as a complex entity and understand the process as an exchange between different parts of the self or between different selves belonging to the same person. Intrapersonal communication contrasts with interpersonal communication, in which the sender and the receiver are distinct persons. The two phenomena influence each other in various ways. For example, positive and negative feedback received from other people affects how a person talks to themself. Intrapersonal communication is involved in interpreting messages received from others and in formulating responses. Because of this role, some theorists hold that intrapersonal communication is the foundation of all communication. But this position is not generally accepted and an alternative is to hold that intrapersonal communication is an internalized version of interpersonal communication.

Because of its many functions and influences, intrapersonal communication is usually understood as a significant psychological phenomenon. It plays a key role in mental health, specifically in relation to positive and negative self-talk. Negative self-talk focuses on bad aspects of the self, at times in an excessively critical way. It is linked to psychological stress, anxiety, and depression. A step commonly associated with countering negative self-talk is to become aware of negative patterns. Further steps are to challenge the truth of overly critical judgments and to foster more positive patterns of thought. Of special relevance in this regard is the self-concept, i.e. how a person sees themself, specifically their self-esteem or how they evaluate their abilities and characteristics. Intrapersonal communication is not as thoroughly researched as other forms of communication. One reason is that it is more difficult to study since it happens primarily as an internal process. Another reason is that the term is often used in a very wide sense making it difficult to demarcate which phenomena belong to it.

== Definition and essential features ==
Intrapersonal communication is communication with oneself. It takes place within a person. Larry Barker and Gordon Wiseman define it as &quot;the creating, functioning, and evaluating of symbolic processes which operate primarily within oneself&quot;. Its most typical forms are self-talk and inner dialogue. For example, when an employee decides to leave work early, they may engage in an inner dialogue by mentally going through possible negative comments from their boss and potential responses. Other inner experiences are also commonly included, such as imagination, visualization, and memory. As a form of communication, it involves the sending and receiving of messages. It is a self-to-self communication, in the sense that the sender and the receiver is the same person. It contrasts with interpersonal communication, in which sender and receiver are distinct persons. Intrapersonal communication is examined by the discipline known as communication studies.

Some theorists, like James Watson and Anne Hill, restrict the definition of intrapersonal communication to inner experiences or &quot;what goes on inside our heads&quot;, like talking to oneself within one&#x27;s mind. But in a wider sense, it also includes external forms of self-to-self communication, such as speaking to oneself aloud during private speech or writing a diary or a shopping list. In this regard, it only matters that the sender and the receiver is the same person but it does not matter whether an external medium was used in the process. A slightly different conception is presented by Piotr K. Oleś et al. They reject the idea that sender and receiver have to be the same person. This is based on the idea that one can have imaginary dialogues with other people, such as a friend, a teacher, a lost relative, or a celebrity. Oleś et al. hold instead that the hallmark of intrapersonal communication is that it only happens in the mind of one person. Some scholars see the process of searching and interpreting information as a central aspect of intrapersonal communication. This applies specifically to inner monologues and reflections on oneself, other people, and the environment. Frank J. Macke and Dean Barnlund stress that the mechanical exchange of messages is not sufficient and that intrapersonal communication has to do with meaning and making sense of things. In this regard, intrapersonal communication can be distinguished from intraorganismic communication, which takes place below the personal level as an exchange of information between organs or cells.

Intrapersonal communication need not be cut off from outer influences and often happens as a reaction to them. For example, hearing a familiar piece of music may stir up memories that lead to an internal dialog with past selves. In a similar sense, intrapersonal communication is not restricted to situations in which a person is alone. Instead, it also happens in social circumstances and may occur simultaneously with interpersonal communication. This is the case, for example, when interpreting what another person has said and when formulating a response before enunciating it. Some theorists, like Mary J. Farley, hold that intrapersonal communication is an essential part of all communication and, therefore, always accompanies interpersonal communication.

In the context of organizations, the term &quot;autocommunication&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym. It is employed to describe self-communication in the workspace. For example, synchronous autocommunication is used when mentally reassuring oneself or drafting a letter. Asynchronous autocommunication, on the other hand, takes the form of reminders or diaries. This term is also sometimes used in semiotics.

== Types ==

Various types of intrapersonal communication are distinguished in the academic literature. The term is often used in a very wide sense and includes many phenomena. A central contrast is based on whether the exchange happens purely internally or is mediated through external means. The internal type is the most discussed form. It plays out in the mind of one person without externally expressing the message. It includes mental processes like thinking, meditating, and reflecting. However, there are also external forms of intrapersonal communication, like talking aloud to oneself in the form of private speech. Other examples are notetaking at school, writing a diary, preparing a shopping list, praying, or reciting a poem. External intrapersonal communication is also characterized by the fact that the sender and the receiver is the same person. The difference is that an external medium is used to express the message.

Another distinction focuses on the role of language. Most discussions in the academic literature are concerned with verbal intrapersonal communication, like self-talk and inner dialogue. Its hallmark is that messages are expressed using a symbolic coding system in the form of a language. They contrast with non-verbal forms like some forms of imagination, visualization, or memory. In this regard, intrapersonal communication can be used, for example, to explore how a piece of music would sound or how a painting should be continued.

Among the inner verbal forms of intrapersonal communication, an often-discussed contrast is between self-talk and inner dialogue. In the case of inner dialogue, two or more positions are considered and the exchange takes place by contrasting them. It usually happens in the form of different voices taking turns in arguing for their position. This can be conceptualized in analogy to interpersonal communication as an exchange of different subjects, selves, or I-positions within the same person. For example, when facing a difficult decision, one part of a person may argue in favor of one option while another part prefers a different option. Inner dialogue can also take the form of an exchange with an imagined partner. This is the case when anticipating a discussion with one&#x27;s spouse or during imaginary conversations with celebrities or lost relatives. For self-talk or inner monologue, on the other hand, there is no split between different positions. It is speech directed at oneself, as when commenting on one&#x27;s performance or telling oneself to &quot;try again&quot;. Self-talk can be positive or negative depending on how the person evaluates themself. For example, after having failed an exam, a student may engage in negative self-talk by saying &quot;I&#x27;m so stupid&quot; or in positive self-talk, like &quot;don&#x27;t worry&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ll do better next time&quot;.

There are many differences between self-talk and inner dialogue. Inner dialogue is usually more complex. It can be used to simulate social situations and examine a topic from different angles. Its goal is frequently to explore the differences between conflicting points of view, to make sense of strange positions, and to integrate different perspectives. It also plays a central role in identity construction and self-organization. One function of self-talk is self-regulation. Other functions include self-distancing, motivation, self-evaluation, and reflection. Self-talk often happens in reaction to or anticipation of certain situations. It can help the agent prepare an appropriate response. It may also be used to regulate emotions and cope with unpleasant experiences as well as monitor oneself. Self-talk and inner dialogue are distinct phenomena but one can quickly turn into the other. For example, an intrapersonal communication may start as self-talk and then evolve into inner dialogue as more positions are considered.

Intrapersonal communication is linked to a great range of phenomena. They include planning, problem-solving, and internal conflict resolution, as well as judgments about oneself and other people. Other forms are perception and understanding as well as conceptualization and interpretation of environmental cues. Further phenomena are data processing like drawing inferences, thinking, and self-persuasion as well as memory, introspection, dreaming, imagining, and feeling.

== Models ==
Various models of communication have been proposed. They aim to provide a simplified overview of the process of communication by showing what its main components are and how they interact. Most of them focus primarily on interpersonal communication but some are specifically formulated with intrapersonal communication in mind.
According to the model proposed by Barker and Wiseman in 1966, intrapersonal communication starts with the reception of external and internal stimuli carrying information. External stimuli belong to the senses and usually provide information about the environment. Internal stimuli include a wide range of impressions, both concerning the state of the body, like pain, but also encompassing feelings.

In the Barker-Wiseman model, an early step of intrapersonal communication focuses on classifying these stimuli. In this process, many of the weaker stimuli are filtered out before reaching a conscious level. But they may still affect communication despite this. A similar process groups the remaining stimuli according to their urgency. It runs in parallel with attempts to attach symbolic meaning to the stimuli as a form of decoding. How these processes take place is influenced by factors like the communicator&#x27;s social background and current environment. After the symbolic decoding process, ideation occurs in the form of thinking, organizing information, planning, and proposing messages. As a last step, the thus conceived ideas are encoded into a symbolic form and expressed using words, gestures, or movements. This process can happen right after the ideation or with some delay. It results in the generation and transmission of more stimuli, either purely internal or also external. The generated stimuli work as a feedback loop leading back to their reception and interpretation. In this sense, the same person is both the sender and the receiver of the messages. The feedback makes it possible for the communicator to monitor and correct messages. 
Another model of communication was proposed by Dean Barnlund in 1970. He aims to give an account of communication that encompasses both its interpersonal and its intrapersonal side. He identifies communication not with the transmission of messages but with the production of meaning in response to internal and external cues. For him, intrapersonal communication is the simpler case since only one person is involved. This person perceives private cues, like internal thoughts and feelings, public cues originating from the environment, and behavioral cues in the form of their own behavior. One part of communication is the process of decoding and interpreting these cues. Its goal is to make sense of them and to reduce uncertainty. It is accompanied by the activity of encoding behavioral responses to the cues. These two processes happen simultaneously and influence each other.

Sheila Steinberg follows Graeme Burton and Richard Dimbleby by understanding intrapersonal communication as a process involving five elements: decoding, integration, memory, perceptual sets, and encoding. Decoding consists in making sense of messages. Integration puts the individual pieces of information extracted this way in relation to each other through processes like comparing and contrasting. Memory stores previously received information. Especially relevant in regard to intrapersonal communication is the concept one has of oneself and how the newly received information relates to it. Perceptual sets are ingrained ways of organizing and evaluating this information, for example, how feminine and masculine traits are conceived. Encoding is the last step, in which the meaning processed in the previous steps is again expressed in symbolic form as a message sent to oneself.

Many theorists focus on the concept of the self in intrapersonal communication. There is a variety of definitions but many agree that the self is an entity that is unique to each individual, i.e. not shared between individuals. Some theorists understand intrapersonal communication as a relation of the self to the same self. Others see the self as a complex entity made up of different parts and analyze the exchange as an interaction between parts. A closely related approach is to talk not of distinct parts of a single self but of different selves in the same person, like an emotional self, an intellectual self, or a physical self. On these views, intrapersonal communication is understood in analogy to interpersonal communication as an exchange between different parts or selves. In either case, intrapersonal relationships play a central role. They concern how a person relates to themselves, for example, how they see themselves and who they wish to be. Intrapersonal relationships are not directly observable. Instead, they have to be inferred based on other changes that can be perceived. For example, inferences about a person&#x27;s self-esteem can be drawn based on whether they respond to a compliment by bragging or by playing it down.

== Relation to interpersonal communication ==
Both intrapersonal and interpersonal communication involve the exchange of messages. For interpersonal communication, the sender and the receiver are distinct persons, like when talking to a friend on the phone. For intrapersonal communication, one and the same person occupies both of these roles. Despite this difference, the two are closely related. For example, some theorists, like Linda Costigan Lederman, conceptualize inner dialogue in analogy to social interaction as an exchange between different parts of the self.

The two phenomena also influence each other in various ways. For example, the positive and negative feedback a person receives from other people shapes their self-concept or how they see themselves. This in turn has implications for how they talk to themselves in the form of positive or negative self-talk. But the converse is also true: how a person talks to themselves affects how they interact with other people. One reason for this is that some form of inner dialog is usually involved when talking to others to interpret what they say and to determine what one wants to communicate to them. For example, if a person&#x27;s intrapersonal communication is characterized by self-criticism, this may make it hard for them to accept praise from other people. On a more basic level, it can affect how messages from other people are interpreted. For example, an overly self-critical person may interpret an honest compliment as a form of sarcasm.

However, self-talk may also interfere with the ability to listen. For example, when a person has an important meeting later today, their thoughts may be racing around this topic, making the person less responsive to interactions in the present. In some cases, the listener is very keen on making a response. This may cause their attention to focus mainly on their self-talk formulating a message. As a result, they may miss important aspects of what the current speaker is saying. Positive and effective self-talk, on the other hand, tends to make people better at communicating with others. One way to become better at interpersonal communication is to become aware of this self-talk and to be able to balance it with the need of listening.

Another discussion in the academic literature is about the question of whether intrapersonal communication is in some sense more basic than interpersonal communication. This is based on the idea that some form of intrapersonal communication is necessary for and accompanies interpersonal communication. For example, when a person receives a message from a friend inviting them to their favorite restaurant, there are often various internal reactions to this message before sending an answer in return. These reactions include sights and scents, memories from previous visits, checking whether this would clash with other plans, and devising a route to get to the restaurant. These reactions are forms of intrapersonal communication. Other examples include self-talk in an attempt to evaluate the positions expressed by the speaker to assess whether one agrees or disagrees with them. But intrapersonal communication can also occur by itself without another party being involved.

For these reasons, some theorists, like James Honeycutt and Sheila Steinberg, have claimed that intrapersonal communication is the foundation of all other forms of communication. Similar claims are that intrapersonal communication is omnipresent and that it is a requirement or preliminary of interpersonal communication. However, the claim of the primacy of intrapersonal communication is not generally accepted and many theorists hold that social interaction is more basic. They often see inner speech as an internalized or derivative version of social speech.

A closely related issue concerns the questions of how interpersonal and intrapersonal communication interact in the development of children. According to Jean Piaget, for example, intrapersonal communication develops first and manifests as a form of egocentric speech. This happens during play activities and may help the child learn to control their activities and plan ahead. Piaget holds that, at this early stage, children are not yet fully social beings and are more concerned with developing their individuality. On this view, interpersonal speech only arises later in the person&#x27;s development. This view is opposed by Lev Vygotsky, who argues that intrapersonal communication only happens as an internalization of interpersonal communication. According to him, children learn the tools for self-talk when their parents talk to them to regulate their behavior, for example, through suggestions, warnings, or commands. Intrapersonal communication may then be understood as an attempt by the child to regulate their behavior through similar means.

== Function and importance ==
Intrapersonal communication serves a great variety of functions. They include internalization, self-regulation, processing information, and problem-solving. Because of this, communication theorist James P. Lantolf characterizes it as an &quot;exceptionally powerful and pervasive tool for thinking&quot;. He identifies two significant functions: to internalize cultural norms or ways of thinking and to regulate one&#x27;s own activity. The self-regulatory function of intrapersonal communication is sometimes understood in analogy to interpersonal communication. For example, parents may influence the behavior of their children by uttering phrases like &quot;wait, think&quot;. Once the child has learned them, they can be employed to control behavior by uttering them internally. This way, people learn to modify, accept, or reject plans of action.

According to Larry Ehrlich, intrapersonal communication has three main functions. One function is to monitor the environment and ensure that it is safe. In this regard, self-talk is used to analyze perceptions and to plan responses in case direct or indirect threats are detected. A closely related function is to bring harmony between the inner and outer world by making sense of oneself and one&#x27;s environment. A third function is of a more existential nature and aims at dealing with loneliness. Many theorists also draw a close connection to the processes of searching and interpreting information.

Inner speech may be needed for many higher mental processes to work. It has a vital role in mental functions such as shaping and controlling one&#x27;s thoughts, regulating one&#x27;s behavior, reasoning, problem-solving, and planning as well as remembering. It often accompanies diverse communicative tasks, such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing, for example, to understand an expression or to formulate a new one. More specific applications are to calm oneself down in stressful situations and to internalize new knowledge when learning a second language. This happens when repeating new vocabulary to oneself in order to remember it. Intrapersonal communication can also be applied to a great variety of creative tasks, like using it to come up with musical compositions, paintings, or dance routines.

Stanley B. Cunningham lists a total of 17 functions or characteristics commonly ascribed to intrapersonal communication. They include talking to oneself, dialogue between different parts of the self, and perception as well as interpreting environmental cues and ascribing meaning to them. Further functions are problem-solving, decision-making, introspection, reflection, dreaming, and self-persuasion. The goal of some external forms of intrapersonal communication, like taking notes at school or writing a shopping list, is to aid memory. In some cases, they can also help break down and address a complex problem in a series of smaller steps, as when solving a mathematical equation line by line.

The importance of intrapersonal communication is reflected by how it affects other phenomena. For example, it has been argued that people who engage in positive self-talk are usually better at problem-solving and communicating with others, including listening skills. Negative intrapersonal communication, on the other hand, is linked to insecurities and low self-esteem and may lead to negative interactions with others. For example, people suffering from the imposter syndrome are continuously affected by self-doubt and anxiety. Their negative intrapersonal communication tends to revolve around fears that their skills are inadequate and may be exposed. In this regard, intrapersonal communication affects a person&#x27;s self-view, their emotions, and whether they see themself as capable or incompetent. It can help build and maintain self-confidence but may also create defense mechanisms. Additionally, it plays a central role in self-discovery and self-delusion.

=== In literature ===
Intrapersonal communication is also relevant in the field of literature. Of particular interest to literary studies is the term &quot;stream of consciousness&quot;. As a mental phenomenon, it is a continuous flow of momentary states of consciousness as they are lived through by the subject. They include experiences like sensory perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and memories. The stream of consciousness is usually seen as a form of intrapersonal communication and the term is sometimes used as a synonym for interior monologue. In literary criticism, the term refers to a narrative technique or a style of writing used to express this stream of experiences. This usually happens by presenting the thoughts of a character directly without any summary or explanation by the narrator. It aims to give the reader a very immediate impression of what a character&#x27;s experience is like. It often takes an unpunctuated and disjointed form that violates rules of grammar and logic. Often-discussed examples are found in Dorothy Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;. Closely related phenomena are introspective writing and inner speech writing. They are usually understood as forms of externalized inner speech in which the person writes down portions of their inner dialogue.

== Relation to mental health ==
The way intrapersonal communication is conducted can be responsible both for positive mental health and mental illness. This pertains specifically to positive and negative self-talk as well as its relation to the self-concept.

=== Positive and negative self-talk ===
Self-talk is a form of talking to oneself. It differs from inner dialogue since it only involves one voice and not an internal exchange between several voices. A common distinction is between positive and negative self-talk based on the evaluative attitude that is expressed. For negative self-talk, the inner voice focuses on bad aspects of the self, often in an excessively critical way. It can take the form of telling oneself that &quot;I&#x27;m never going to be able to do this&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m no good at this&quot;. Negative self-talk can already develop during childhood based on feedback from others, particularly parents.

For some people, negative self-talk is not just an occasional occurrence but happens frequently. In such cases, it can have detrimental effects on mental health. For example, it can affect emotional well-being by evoking a negative mood. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression. It can also negatively affect a person&#x27;s confidence in various areas, for example, concerning their body image. Positive self-talk, on the other hand, involves seeing oneself in a positive light. It is linked to mental health benefits. They include higher self-esteem and well-being as well as reducing the effects of depression and personality disorders. It is associated with lower stress levels and a reduced risk of self-harm and suicide. The effects of positive and negative self-talk are often discussed in sport psychology. A common idea in this regard is that positive self-talk enhances performance while negative self-talk hinders it. There is some empirical evidence supporting this position but it has not yet been thoroughly researched.

Like other forms of communication, intrapersonal communication can be trained and improved to be more effective. This often happens with the goal of reducing negative self-talk and fostering positive self-talk instead. An early step is often to become aware of negative patterns and acknowledge their existence. This can be followed by questioning and challenging negative evaluations since they are often exaggerated. The person may also try to stop them and replace them with more positive thoughts. For example, when the person becomes aware of a negative thinking process, they may try to inhibit it and direct their attention to more positive outcomes.

A similar approach is used in cognitive behavioral therapy. A central idea in this field is that a set of negative core beliefs is responsible for negative self-talk. They can include beliefs like &quot;I&#x27;m unlovable&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m unworthy&quot;, or &quot;the world is threatening and I&#x27;m unable to face its challenges&quot;. A key therapeutic method for improving intrapersonal communication is to become aware of these beliefs and to question their truth. A further approach focuses on the practice of mindfulness. By raising self-awareness, it may improve self-esteem and intrapersonal communication. This practice consists in directing one&#x27;s attention to experiences in the present moment without any evaluation of these experiences. Abstaining from value judgments may help to avoid overly critical evaluations and instead foster an attitude of acceptance.

==== Examples of specific forms of self-talk and their effects ====
Different forms of self-talk can have different effects on the person. One form is coping self-talk. Its main aim is to help a person cope with a difficult situation, such as when experiencing anxiety. It consists in emphasizing the person&#x27;s strengths and skills without implying perfection. This can help people calm down and become clear on their goals and how to realistically achieve them. Another relevant form is instructional self-talk, which focuses attention on the components of a task and can improve performance on physical tasks that are being learned. However, it may have negative effects for people who are already skilled in the task.

Some forms of self-talk address the self by employing first-person pronouns (&quot;I&quot;) while others use second-person pronouns (&quot;you&quot;). Generally speaking, people are more likely to use the second-person pronoun when there is a need for self-regulation, an imperative to overcome difficulties, and facilitation of hard actions. The use of first-person intrapersonal pronouns is more frequent when people are talking to themselves about their feelings. A 2014 study by Sanda Dolcos and Dolores Albarracin indicates that using the second-person pronoun to provide self-suggestions is more effective in promoting the intentions to carry out behaviors and performances.

=== Self-concept and self-esteem ===
The self-concept plays a key role in intrapersonal communication. A person&#x27;s self-concept is what they think and feel about themselves, for example, in relation to their appearance and attitudes as well as strengths and weaknesses. So seeing oneself as sincere, respectful, and thoughtful is one self-concept while seeing oneself as mean, abusive, and deceitful is another. The terms &quot;self-image&quot; and &quot;self-esteem&quot; are sometimes used as synonyms but some theorists draw precise distinctions between them. According to Carl Rogers, the self-concept has three parts: self-image, ideal self, and self-worth. Self-image concerns the properties that a person ascribes to themself. The ideal-self is the ideal the person strives toward or what they want to be like. Self-worth corresponds to whether they see themself overall as a good or a bad person.

Many theorists use the term &quot;self-esteem&quot; instead of &quot;self-worth&quot;. Self-esteem is a central aspect characterizing intrapersonal communication and refers to a person&#x27;s subjective evaluation of their abilities and characteristics. As a subjective evaluation, it may differ from the facts and is often based mainly on an emotional outlook and less on a rational judgment. For example, some skilled people suffer from the imposter syndrome, which leads them to believe that they are imposters lacking the skills they actually have. Self-esteem matters for mental health. Low self-esteem is linked to problems ranging from depression, loneliness, and alienation to drug abuse and teenage pregnancy. Self-esteem also affects how a person communicates with themself and others.

The self is not a static or inborn entity but changes throughout life. Interactions with other people have an effect on the individual&#x27;s self-image. This is especially true in relation to how they judge the person and when receiving positive or negative feedback on an important task. Inner speech is strongly associated with a sense of self. The development of this sense in children is tied to the development of language. There are, however, cases of an internal monologue or inner voice being considered external to the self. Examples are auditory hallucinations, the conceptualization of negative or critical thoughts as an inner critic, or a kind of divine intervention. As a delusion, this can be called &quot;thought insertion&quot;. A similar topic is discussed by Simon Jones and Charles Fernyhough, who explain cases of auditory verbal hallucinations as a form of inner speech. Auditory verbal hallucinations are cases in which a person hears speech without any external stimulation. On their view, speech is an inner action controlled by the agent. But in some pathological cases, it is not recognized as an action. This leads to an auditory verbal hallucination since the voice is experienced as an external or alien element.

== Research and criticism ==
Intrapersonal communication has not been researched as thoroughly as other types of communication. One reason is that there are additional problems concerning how to study it and how to conceptualize it. A difficulty in this regard is that it is not as easy to observe as interpersonal communication. This is due to the fact that it mostly occurs internally without an immediate external manifestation. Since it is not directly observable, it has to be inferred based on other changes that can be visible. For example, when seeing that a person dresses well and takes care of their health, one may infer that certain intrapersonal relationships are responsible for this behavior. A similar inference about a person&#x27;s inner life could be drawn based on whether they respond to a compliment by bragging or by playing it down.

A further approach is to use questionnaires to study intrapersonal communication. Questionnaires sometimes used in the process include the Self-Talk Scale, the Varieties of Inner Speech Questionnaire, and the Internal Dialogical Activity Scale. Among other things, they aim to measure what types of intrapersonal communication a person engages in and how frequently they do so. Younger children are less likely to report using inner speech instead of visual thinking than older children and adults. But it is not known whether this is due to lack of inner speech or due to insufficiently developed introspection. A method to study intrapersonal communication in natural environments, developed by Russell Hurlburt, is to have participants describe their inner experience at random intervals the moment a beeper goes off.

Some criticisms focus on the concept of intrapersonal communication itself. Intrapersonal communication is commonly accepted and used as a distinct type of communication. However, some theorists reject the claim that it is actually a form of communication. Instead, they see it as a different phenomenon that is merely related to communication. A prominent defender of this position is Cunningham. He argues that many inner experiences discussed under this label form part of communicative processes. But he denies that they themselves are instances of communication. This pertains to forms of cognitive, perceptual, and motivational episodes commonly categorized as intrapersonal communication. He sees such categorizations as an &quot;uncritical extension of communication terminology and metaphors to the facts of our inner life space.&quot; This is closely connected to the problem that the expression &quot;intrapersonal communication&quot; is often used in a very wide and ambiguous sense. However, some theorists have objected to Cunningham&#x27;s critique. One argument is that communication studies in general is a multiparadigmatic discipline. This implies that it has not yet established definitions of its terms that are both precise and generally accepted. According to this view, the lack of precision does not mean that the concept is useless.
A further problem in defining intrapersonal communication is that there are countless processes within the human body responsible for exchanging messages. So when understood in this very wide sense, even processes like breathing could be understood as intrapersonal communication. For this reason, the term is usually understood in a more restricted sense. Frank J. Macke approaches this problem by arguing that intrapersonal communication has to do with meaning and that some form of communicative experience is involved. On this view, the mechanical exchange of messages alone is not sufficient for communication.
