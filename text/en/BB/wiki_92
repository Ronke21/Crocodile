<text>The president of Russia, officially the president of the Russian Federation (), is the executive head of state of Russia. The president is the chair of the Federal State Council and the supreme commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces. It is the highest office in Russia.

The modern incarnation of the office emerged from the president of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). In 1991, Boris Yeltsin was elected president of the RSFSR, becoming the first non-Communist Party member to be elected into a major Soviet political role. He played a crucial role in the dissolution of the Soviet Union which saw the transformation of the RSFSR into the Russian Federation. Following a series of scandals and doubts about his leadership, violence erupted across Moscow in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. As a result, a new constitution was implemented and the 1993 Russian Constitution remains in force today. The constitution establishes Russia as a semi-presidential system which separates the president of Russia from the government of Russia which exercises executive power.

In all cases where the president of the Russian Federation is unable to fulfill their duties, those duties shall be temporarily delegated to the prime minister of Russia, who becomes acting president of Russia.

The powers of the presidency include: execution of federal law, appointing federal ministers, and members of the judiciary, and negotiating treaties with foreign powers. The president also has the power to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn the Federal Assembly under extraordinary circumstances. The president also appoints the prime minister, who directs domestic policy of the Russian Federation alongside the president.

The president is elected directly through a popular vote to a six-year term. Previously, the Constitution established a term limit for the presidency restricting the officeholder to serve no more than two consecutive terms. However, this limitation has since been overhauled in large part due to the constitutional amendments that were ratified in 2020. One of the amendments passed reset the terms of both Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, allowing either to serve as president for a full two terms regardless of their previous terms. In all, three individuals have served four presidencies spanning six full terms. In May 2012, Vladimir Putin became the fourth president; he was re-elected in March 2018 and in March 2024 for two consecutive six-year terms.

==History==
After the fall of monarchy in 1917, the All-Russian Constituent Assembly, elected later that year, planned on establishing a democratic presidential or semi-presidential federal republic, proclaiming the Russian Democratic Federal Republic (RDFR) in January 1918. The president of the RDFR would have been the head of state, elected for a one-year term by a majority vote in parliament involving the deputies of both chambers. Due to the dissolution of the assembly by the Bolsheviks and establishment of their one-party dictatorship, no person was ever elected to this office.

Boris Yeltsin came to power with a wave of high expectations not long before the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse. In May 1990, he was elected as chairman of the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (SFSR) – the highest state office – and thus became the head of state. As a result of the creation of the post of President of the Soviet Union, the Union republics also began to introduce the post of President. To do this, a referendum was held in the Russian SFSR, in which 71% of voters voted for the creation of the post of President, elected in direct elections. On 12 June 1991 Yeltsin was elected president of the Russian SFSR with 57% of the vote, becoming the first popularly elected president. However, Yeltsin never recovered his popularity after a series of economic and political crises in Russia in the 1990s. The Yeltsin era was marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems. By the time he left office, Yeltsin had an approval rating of two percent by some estimates.

Throughout his presidential terms and into his second term as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin has enjoyed high approval ratings amongst the Russian public. During his eight years in office, the Russian economy bounced back from crisis, seeing the country&#x27;s GDP increase sixfold (72% in PPP), poverty cut more than half and average monthly salaries increase from $80 to $640, or by 150% in real rates. At the same time, his conduct in office has been questioned by domestic dissenters, as well as foreign governments and human rights organizations, for his handling of internal conflicts in Chechnya and Dagestan, his record on internal human rights and freedoms, his relations with former Soviet republics, and his relations with the so-called oligarchs: Russian businessmen with a high degree of power and influence within both the Russian government and economy. This was seen by the Kremlin as a series of anti-Russian propaganda attacks orchestrated by western opponents and exiled &quot;oligarchs&quot;.

Medvedev was appointed as first deputy prime minister on 14 November 2005. Formerly Vladimir Putin&#x27;s chief of staff, he was also the chairman of Gazprom&#x27;s board of directors, a post he had held, for the second time, since 2000. On 10 December 2007, he was informally endorsed as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections by the most prominent Russian political party, United Russia, and officially endorsed on 17 December 2007. Medvedev&#x27;s candidacy was supported by outgoing president Vladimir Putin and pro-presidential parties. As technocrat and political appointee, Medvedev – Putin&#x27;s former chief of staff and one-time rival to Sergey Ivanov – had never held elective office before 2009. Medvedev chose Putin as his prime minister; in 2012, Putin ran for the presidency, won, and appointed Medvedev as prime minister.

==Selection process==
===Eligibility===
A presidential candidate must be a citizen of the Russian Federation who is at least 35 years old, has permanently resided in Russia for at least 25 years and does not have and has never previously had foreign citizenship or a foreign residence permit. Following constitutional amendments in 2020, the requirement of permanent residence in Russia increased from 10 years to 25 years and a new requirement preventing a presidential candidate from ever having foreign citizenship or a foreign residence permit was introduced.

The Russian constitution limits the number of terms a president can serve to two terms. Previously, the constitution only limited the president to two consecutive terms, allowing a former president to seek re-election after sitting out one complete term. However, following constitutional changes in 2020, this was changed to two terms overall, allowing the incumbent president and former presidents to serve two more terms.

===Election===

The election of the president is mainly regulated by the Presidential Election Law (PEL) and the Basic Guarantees of Electoral Rights (BGL). The Federation Council calls the presidential elections. If it does not call a presidential election that is due, the Central Election Commission will call the presidential election. The election day is the second Sunday of the month and the presidential electoral constituency is the territory of the Russian Federation as a whole.
Each faction in the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament has the right to nominate a candidate for the presidential elections. The minimum number of signatures for a presidential candidate fielded by a political party with no parliamentary representation is 100,000, down from 2 million before amendments to the law.

Terms were extended from four to six years in 2008, during Dmitry Medvedev&#x27;s administration. The president is elected in a two-round system every six years, with a two consecutive term limitation. If no candidate wins by an absolute majority in the first round, a second election round is held between two candidates with the most votes. The last presidential election was in 2024, and the next is in 2030.

===Inauguration===

The inauguration of the president of Russia is conducted six years after the previous inauguration (since 2000, on 7 May). If the president is chosen in an early election, they are scheduled to take the oath thirty days after the announcement of the results.

Before executing the powers of the office, a president is constitutionally required to take the presidential oath:

===Vacancy or disability===

Vacancies in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances: death, resignation and removal from office. In all cases when the president is unable to perform their duties, their powers are temporarily transferred to the prime minister until the new president takes office.

==Insignia==
After the oath of office has been taken by the elected president, these following insignia are handed over to the president. These devices are used to display the rank of their office and are used on special occasions.

===Chain of office===

The first insignia that is issued is the chain of office with an emblem. The central emblem is the red cross of the Order &quot;For Merit to the Fatherland&quot;, with arms in equal size, charged with the Russian coat of arms. On the reverse of the cross, the words &quot;Benefit, Honor and Glory&quot; appear in the form of a circle. A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain. There are 17 &quot;links&quot; in the emblem, with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms. The other eight consist of a rosette, also bearing the motto &quot;Benefit, Honor and Glory.&quot; At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin, the emblem was placed on a red pillow, positioned on the left side of the podium. According to the Presidential website, the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions.

===Standard (flag)===
The standard is a square version of the Russian flag, charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside their office, at the Kremlin, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia. A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea. This is the most used symbol to denote the presence of the Russian President.

===Special copy of the Constitution===
The President also has a special copy of the Russian Constitution that is used during the inauguration. This copy has a hard, red cover with gold lettering. An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver. The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library.

===Legal basis of the insignia===
These insignia and the procedure were established by the presidential decree 1138 from 5 August 1996, and modified by decree 832 from 6 May 2000. In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees. Nonetheless, the special copy of the Constitution still exists and serves for inauguration purposes only without being officially presented as a symbol of the Russian Presidency.

===Presidential Fanfare===

The Presidential Fanfare is a composition played exclusively for the President of Russia, when they enter a place or an event.

==Powers and duties==
===Guarantor of the Constitution===
As the guarantor of the Constitution and the entire system of constitutional law, the president ensures that the constitutions, laws and regulations of the constituent territories of the Russian Federation be in full compliance with the country&#x27;s Constitution and federal laws.

===Nominations===
The president is highly active in appointing top officials in the country. They nominate candidates for official state positions, who must ultimately be appointed based on parliamentary vote. The president submits nominations to the Federation Council, the upper house of the parliament, for judges of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, as well as for prosecutor general of Russia. A proposal to relieve the prosecutor general of their duties must also be submitted to the Federation Council. The president submits to the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, nominations for appointment to the office of the chairperson of the Central Bank, and likewise submits to the State Duma any proposal to relieve the chairperson of the Central Bank of their duties.

===Legislation===
Under the procedure stipulated by the Constitution, the president exercises their right to submit draft legislation, as well as the right to sign bills into law or to veto them.

The president has the right to suspend laws and regulations issued by executive bodies of Russia&#x27;s constituent territories if such laws and regulations contravene the Constitution, federal laws or international obligations of the Russian Federation, or violate human and civil rights and liberties, pending the resolution of the issue in an appropriate court.

The president can issue by-laws by decree, so long as such decrees are not in contradiction with existing laws (both local and federal), Russia&#x27;s international agreements or the Russian Constitution.

The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of the Federal Assembly under extraordinary circumstances.

Other powers of the president in the sphere of legal activities and in their interaction with the parliament include calling elections to the State Duma, dissolving the State Duma in certain cases, and calling a referendum.

===Domestic policy===
Under the Constitution, the president is not empowered to determine the full range of short-, middle-, and long-term objectives and targets of domestic policy, but only its basic guidelines. In practice, they determine it with the prime minister and the government of the federation. They are to be implemented both by the president themself and by the government of Russia within the bounds of their authority. The president&#x27;s fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in their written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as their letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.

Within the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the president also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the president is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.

===Foreign policy===

The president is invested with extensive rights to implement the state&#x27;s foreign policy. The president determines Russia&#x27;s position in international affairs, along with the prime minister and the government of the federation, and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs ratification documents. The president appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of Russia to foreign states and international organizations. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the two houses of the Federal Assembly. The president signs international treaties.

=== Commander-in-chief ===

The president of Russia bears ultimate authority over the Russian Armed Forces as &quot;Supreme Commander-in-Chief&quot;, a role established by Article 87 of the Constitution. In this capacity, the president issues military directives, makes defence policy and appoints the High Command of the Armed Forces.

Furthermore, several articles of the Defence Statute enable the president to order a general or partial mobilization of the military, announce martial law, oversee the war industry and make regulations.

A 2020 military doctrine governs the use of Russian nuclear arms; it allows the president to launch atomic weapons in response to WMD or ballistic missile strikes, attacks that threaten the integrity of the nuclear arsenal, and attacks that may jeopardise the country as a whole.

===Ceremonial duties===
An important ceremonial role of the president is awarding state awards. State Awards of the Russian Federation are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of Hero of the Russian Federation, Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the president, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony. A Commission for State Honors, which works on a voluntary basis, helps the president to objectively assess potential recipients.

==Residences==

The primary working president&#x27;s residence is the Senate building (also known as 1st building) in the Moscow Kremlin complex. Also the president can use the Grand Kremlin Palace (used for official ceremonies and meetings). Previously, the president also could use the so-called 14th Administrative Corpus Building (the reserve residence), but in 2016, it was demolished.

Since 2000, the current home residence of the president is &quot;Novo-Ogaryovo&quot; (). It was planned that it would remain at the disposal of Vladimir Putin after his term ended, as &quot;Gorki-9&quot; () (also called &quot;Barvikha&quot; (), but actually near it) had remained at the disposal of Boris Yeltsin after his retirement.

Also, the president has several vacation residences outside of Moscow.
* &quot;Rus&#x27; State Residence&quot; (Zavidovo), Tver Oblast
* &quot;Congress Palace&quot; or &quot;Constantine Palace&quot; complex (), Strelna, Saint Petersburg, reconstructed for 300th Saint Petersburg anniversary
* &quot;Bocharov Ruchey&quot; (, lit. Bocharov creek), Sochi
* &quot;Shuyskaya Chupa&quot; () at a distance of 25 km from Petrozavodsk, Karelia
* &quot;Dolgiye Borody&quot; () (also known as &quot;Uzhin&quot; ) at a distance of 20 km from Valday, Novgorod Oblast
* &quot;Volzhskiy Utyos&quot; sanatorium (, lit. Cliff-upon-Volga) on Kuybyshev Reservoir shore
* &quot;Tantal&quot; tourist centre (, lit. Tantalum) on Volga bank, at a distance of 25 km from Saratov
* &quot;Sosny&quot; (, lit. pines) on Yenisei bank, near Krasnoyarsk.
* &quot;Angarskie hutora&quot; (, lit. Steadings of Angarsk) at a distance of 47 km from Irkutsk
* &quot;Maly istok&quot; (, lit. The small headspring) inside Ekaterineburg forestry

==Political affiliation==
None of the Russian presidents to date have ever been a member of a political party while in office. In 2012, commenting on stepping down from the post of United Russia party leader, Vladimir Putin said &quot;The constitution doesn&#x27;t forbid the president to be a member of any party, but in the spirit of how our political life has evolved, a president is first and foremost a consolidating figure for all the political forces of the country, for all citizens&quot;.

==Transport==
National transport services for the Russian president and the presidential state car are provided by the Special Purpose Garage (SPG). The SPG is a unit within the Federal Protective Service.
* Limousines 
** Aurus Senat – main car
** Mercedes-Benz S600 Pullman Guard
* Escort cars
** Mercedes-Benz (including G-Class)
** Chevrolet
*Honorary escort (motorcycles)
** BMW

Air transport services for the president are provided by the airline company Rossiya Airlines.

* Airplanes for long-distance travel
** Ilyushin Il-96-300PU (long-range) – main aircraft
** Ilyushin Il-62M (long-range)
** Dassault Falcon 900 (long-range)
** Tupolev Tu-154 (medium-range)
** Yakovlev Yak-40 (short-range)
** Tupolev Tu-214PU
* Helicopters
** Mil Mi-8

The presidential aircraft uses the same colour scheme as standard Rossiya aircraft, except for the use of the Russian coat of arms or the presidential standard on the empennage instead of the flag of Russia.

In the spring of 2013 a helipad was constructed in the Moscow Kremlin. According to the chief of the Kremlin Property Agency construction of a helicopter pad for the president cost 200 million rubles (about $6.4 mln). The helipad is located in the Kremlin&#x27;s Tainitsky Garden close to exterior walls.

==Post-presidency==
On 16 August 1995, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree &quot;On some social guarantees of persons holding public positions of the Russian Federation and the position of federal public servants.&quot; 15 June 1999 went to President Yeltsin&#x27;s decree on amendments and additions to the previous decree. On 11 November 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the implementation of the amended decree of 15 June 1999.

On 31 December 1999, the day of the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, the president issued a decree &quot;On guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stop exercising their powers, and their family,&quot; and the eponymous federal law was adopted by 25 January 2001.

This law establishes the legal, social and other guarantees of the Russian Federation&#x27;s president, stops the execution of its powers in connection with the expiration of their term of office or in advance in the event of their resignation or permanent incapacity for health reasons to exercise the powers belonging to them and their family:

*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, regardless of age, is entitled to a monthly lifetime pay of 75% of the monthly remuneration of the President of Russia.
*In the case of the President&#x27;s death their family members are entitled to a monthly allowance in the amount equal to six times the minimum old-age pension, established by the federal law on the day of their death.
*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, has immunity. They can not be held criminally or administratively liable for acts committed by them during the execution of the President&#x27;s powers, as well as arrested, detained, interrogated and subjected to a personal search, if these actions are carried out in the course of proceedings relating to the execution of their powers as president.

Beginning in 1999, all living former presidents were granted a pension, an office, and a staff. The pension has increased numerous times. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the government. All former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 are protected by the Federal Protective Service until the president&#x27;s death. A spouse who remarries or divorced from president is no longer eligible for Federal Protective Service protection.

In 2020, the Constitution was amended to grant the former president immunity (except if they were removed from office by impeachment). This immunity may be lifted in the same manner as the impeachment procedure. Also, in accordance with the amendments, former presidents (except if they were removed from office by impeachment) were granted the right to become senators for life.
In May 2008, the Federal law №68, &quot;On centers of historical heritage of presidents of the Russian Federation ceased to carry out its powers&quot;, was adopted. According to this law, the objectives of the centers are the study and public presentation of historical heritage of presidents of Russia as an integral part of the modern history of Russia, the development of democratic institutions and the rule of law. The centers will be built for each former president of Russia. The first such center dedicated to Boris Yeltsin was opened in 2015 in Yekaterinburg. In the future the creation of presidential centers for Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev is also planned.

<text>Flavian II of Antioch (; , &quot;Phlabianós II Antiokheías&quot;) was the Patriarch of Antioch from 498 until his deposition and subsequent banishment in 512.

== Biography ==
Flavian was a Monk under the Rule of St Basil at the Monastery of Tilmognon and later became an apocrisiarius. After the death of Patriarch Palladius in 498, Flavian was appointed by Emperor Anastasius I as Patriarch of Antioch on the condition that he accepted the Henotikon. However, during his reign as patriarch, Flavian II did not show any opposition to Chalcedonian Christianity.

As patriarch, Flavian II and Patriarch Elias I of Jerusalem, resisted the attempts to abolish the Council of Chalcedon. However, due to the conflict between Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians in Antioch, Flavian II endeavoured to please both parties by steering a middle course in reference to the Chalcedonian decrees, yet was forced by Anastasius to sign the Henotikon in 508/509. Furthermore, Flavian II was accused of Nestorianism by Philoxenus of Mabbug, Bishop of Hierapolis.

In 511, Philoxenus convinced Monophysites of the surrounding Syrian countryside to storm Antioch and force Flavian II to condemn the Council of Chalcedon but was met by fierce Chalcedonians who slaughtered the attackers and dumped their bodies into the River Orontes. The monks of Flavian II&#x27;s former monastery journeyed to Antioch to defend Flavian II against the anti-Chalcedonians. These events drove Anastasius to adopt a Miaphysite ecclesiastical programme and thus Flavian II and Elias I lost imperial support.

A synod was convened in Sidon in 512 by Philoxenus and eighty other non-Chalcedonian bishops, with the support of Anastasius, to condemn Flavian II and Elias I and as a result he was deposed and banished to Petra, where he died in 518. Flavian II&#x27;s deposition and subsequent resentment towards Anastasius caused Vitalian&#x27;s rebellion in 513. Flavian II was soon posthumously enrolled among the saints of the Eastern Church, and after some opposition, in the Western Church as well.

<doc id="239648" wikidata="Q210603" url="?curid=239648" title="Extradition">
<text>In an extradition, one jurisdiction delivers a person accused or convicted of committing a crime in another jurisdiction, into the custody of the other&#x27;s law enforcement. It is a cooperative law enforcement procedure between the two jurisdictions, and depends on the arrangements made between them. In addition to legal aspects of the process, extradition also involves the physical transfer of custody of the person being extradited to the legal authority of the requesting jurisdiction.

In an extradition process, one sovereign jurisdiction typically makes a formal request to another sovereign jurisdiction (&quot;the requested state&quot;). If the fugitive is found within the territory of the requested state, then the requested state may arrest the fugitive and subject them to its extradition process. The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of the requested state.

Between countries, extradition is normally regulated by treaties. Where extradition is compelled by laws, such as among sub-national jurisdictions, the concept may be known more generally as rendition. It is an ancient mechanism, dating back to at least the 13th century BCE, when an Egyptian pharaoh, Ramesses II, negotiated an extradition treaty with a Hittite king, Hattusili III.

== Extradition treaties or agreements ==
The consensus in international law is that a state does not have any obligation to surrender an alleged criminal to a foreign state, because one principle of sovereignty is that every state has legal authority over the people within its borders. Such absence of international obligation, and the desire for the right to demand such criminals from other countries, have caused a web of extradition treaties or agreements to evolve. When no applicable extradition agreement is in place, a state may still request the expulsion or lawful return of an individual pursuant to the requested state&#x27;s domestic law. This can be accomplished through the immigration laws of the requested state or other facets of the requested state&#x27;s domestic law. Similarly, the codes of penal procedure in many countries contain provisions allowing for extradition to take place in the absence of an extradition agreement. States may, therefore, still request the expulsion or lawful return of a fugitive from the territory of a requested state in the absence of an extradition treaty.

No country in the world has an extradition treaty with all other countries; for example, the United States lacks extradition treaties with China, Russia, Namibia, the United Arab Emirates, North Korea, Bahrain, and many other countries.

There are two types of extradition treaties: list and dual criminality treaties. The most common and traditional is the list treaty, which contains a list of crimes for which a suspect is to be extradited. Dual criminality treaties generally allow for the extradition of a criminal suspect if the punishment is more than one year imprisonment in accordance with the laws of both countries. Occasionally the length of the sentence agreed upon between the two countries is varied. Under both types of treaties, if the conduct is not considered a crime in both of the countries involved then it will not be an extraditable offense.

Generally, an extradition treaty requires that a country seeking extradition be able to show that:
*The relevant crime is sufficiently serious.
*There exists a &quot;prima facie&quot; case against the individual sought.
*The event in question qualifies as a crime in both countries.
*The extradited person can reasonably expect a fair trial in the recipient country.
*The likely penalty will be proportionate to the crime.

The most common crimes that lead to extradition include:

*Drug trafficking;
*Corruption and financial crimes;
*Cybercrimes;
*Violent crimes against life and health;
*Crimes against national security.

=== Restrictions ===
Most countries require themselves to deny extradition requests if, in the government&#x27;s opinion, the suspect is being sought for a political crime. Many countries, such as Mexico, Canada and most European nations, will not allow extradition if the death penalty may be imposed on the suspect unless they are assured that the death sentence will not be passed or carried out. In the case of &quot;Soering v. United Kingdom&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights held that it would violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights to extradite a person to the United States from the United Kingdom in a capital case. This was due to the harsh conditions on death row and the uncertain timescale within which the sentence would be executed. Parties to the European Convention also cannot extradite people where they would be at significant risk of being tortured inhumanely or degradingly treated or punished.

These restrictions are normally clearly spelled out in the extradition treaties that a government has agreed upon. They are, however, controversial in the United States, where the death penalty is practiced in some U.S. states, as it is seen by many as an attempt by foreign nations to interfere with the U.S. criminal justice system. In contrast, pressures by the U.S. government on these countries to change their laws, or even sometimes to ignore their laws, is perceived by many in those nations as an attempt by the United States to interfere in their sovereign right to manage justice within their own borders. Famous examples include the extradition dispute with Canada on Charles Ng, who was eventually extradited to the United States on murder charges.

Countries with a rule of law typically make extradition subject to review by that country&#x27;s courts. These courts may impose certain restrictions on extradition, or prevent it altogether, if for instance they deem the accusations to be based on dubious evidence, or evidence obtained from torture, or if they believe that the defendant will not be granted a fair trial on arrival, or will be subject to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment if extradited.

Several countries, such as France, the Russian Federation, Austria, China and Japan, have laws against extraditing their respective citizens. Others, such as Germany and Israel, do not allow for extradition of their own citizens in their constitutions. Some others stipulate such prohibition on extradition agreements rather than their laws. Such restrictions are occasionally controversial in other countries when, for example, a French citizen commits a crime abroad and then returns to their home country, often being perceived as doing so to avoid prosecution. These countries, however, make their criminal laws applicable to citizens abroad, and they try citizens suspected of crimes committed abroad under their own laws. Such suspects are typically prosecuted as if the crime had occurred within the country&#x27;s borders.

=== Exemptions in the European Union ===
The usual extradition agreement safeguards relating to dual-criminality, the presence of &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence and the possibility of a fair trial have been waived by many European nations for a list of specified offences under the terms of the European Arrest Warrant. The warrant entered into force in eight European Union (EU) member-states on 1 January 2004, and is in force in all member-states since 22 April 2005. Defenders of the warrant argue that the usual safeguards are not necessary because every EU nation is committed by treaty, and often by legal and constitutional provisions, to the right to a fair trial, and because every EU member-state is subject to the European Convention on Human Rights.

=== Extradition to federations ===
The federal structure of some countries, such as the United States, can pose particular problems for extraditions when the police power and the power of foreign relations are held at different levels of the federal hierarchy. For instance, in the United States, most criminal prosecutions occur at the state level, and most foreign relations occurs on the federal level. In fact, under the United States Constitution, foreign countries may not have official treaty relations with the individual states; rather, they may have treaty relations only with the federal government. As a result, a US state that wishes to prosecute an individual located in foreign territory must direct its extradition request through the federal government, which will negotiate the extradition with the requested state. However, due to the constraints of federalism, any conditions on the extradition accepted by the federal government – such as not to impose the death penalty – are not binding on the states. In the case of &quot;Soering v. United Kingdom&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the United Kingdom was not permitted under its treaty obligations to extradite an individual to the United States, because the United States&#x27; federal government was constitutionally unable to offer binding assurances that the death penalty would not be sought in Virginia state courts. Ultimately, the Commonwealth of Virginia itself had to offer assurances to the federal government, which passed those assurances on to the United Kingdom, which then extradited the individual to the United States.

Less important problems can arise due to differing qualifications for crimes. For instance, in the United States, crossing state lines is a prerequisite for certain federal crimes (otherwise crimes such as murder, etc. are handled by state governments (except in certain circumstances such as the killing of a federal official). This transportation clause is, understandably, absent from the laws of many countries, however. Extradition treaties or subsequent diplomatic correspondence often include language providing that such criteria should not be taken into account when checking if the crime is one in the country from which extradition should apply.

== Bars to extradition ==
By enacting laws or in concluding treaties or agreements, countries determine the conditions under which they may entertain or deny extradition requests. Observing fundamental human rights is also an important reason for denying some extradition requests. It is common for human rights exceptions to be specifically incorporated in bilateral treaties. Such bars can be invoked in relation to the treatment of the individual in the receiving country, including their trial and sentence. These bars may also extend to take account of the effect on family of the individual if extradition proceeds. Therefore, human rights recognised by international and regional agreements may be the basis for denying extradition requests. However, cases where extradition is denied should be treated as independent exceptions and will only occur in exceptional circumstances.

Common bars to extradition include:

=== Failure to fulfill dual criminality ===

Generally the act for which extradition is sought must constitute a crime punishable by some minimum penalty in both the requesting and the requested states.

This requirement has been abolished for broad categories of crimes in some jurisdictions, notably within the European Union.

=== Political nature of the alleged crime ===

Many countries refuse to extradite suspects of political crimes. Such exceptions aim to prevent the misuse of extradition for political purposes, protecting individuals from being prosecuted or punished for their political beliefs or activities in another country. Countries may refuse extradition to avoid becoming involved in politically motivated cases, or gaining a bargaining chip over a rival state.

=== Possibility of certain forms of punishment ===
Some countries refuse extradition on grounds that the person, if extradited, may receive capital punishment or face torture. A few go as far as to cover all punishments that they themselves would not administer.
* Death penalty: Several jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, Macao, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom and most European nations except Belarus, will not consent to the extradition of a suspect if the death penalty is a possible sentencing option unless they are assured that the death sentence will not be passed or carried out. The United Nations Human Rights Committee considered the case of Joseph Kindler, following the Canadian Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Kindler v Canada&quot; to extradite Kindler who faced the death penalty in the United States. This decision was given despite the fact that it was expressly provided in the extradition treaty between these two states that extradition may be refused, unless assurances were given that the death penalty shall not be imposed or executed, as well as arguably being a violation of the individual&#x27;s rights under the Canadian Charter of Human Rights. The decision by the Committee considered Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the &quot;inherent right to life&quot; and whether this right prohibited Canada from extraditing the individual to the United States where he faced the death penalty. The Committee decided that there was nothing contained in the terms of Article 6 which required Canada to seek assurance that the individual would not face the death penalty if extradited. However, the Committee noted that if Canada had extradited without due process it would have breached its obligation under the Convention in this case.
* Torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: Many countries will not extradite if there is a risk that a requested person will be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In regard to torture the European Court of Human Rights has in the past not accepted assurances that torture will not occur when given by a state where torture is systematic or endemic. Although in the more recent case before the same court &quot;Othman (Abu Qatada) v. United Kingdom&quot; the court retreated from this firm refusal and instead took a more subjective approach for assessing state assurances. Unlike capital punishment it is often more difficult to prove the existence of torture within a state and considerations often depend on the assessment of quality and validity of assurances given by the requesting state. In the deportation case of &quot;Othman (Abu Qatada)&quot; the court provided 11 factors the court will assess in determining the validity of these assurances. While torture is provided for as a bar to extradition by the European Convention on Human Rights and more universally by the Convention Against Torture, it is also a &quot;jus cogens&quot; norm under international law and can therefore be invoked as a bar even if it is not provided for in an extradition agreement. In the case of &quot;Soering v United Kingdom&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights held that it would violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights to extradite a person to the United States from the United Kingdom in a capital punishment case. This was due to the harsh conditions on death row and the uncertain timescale within which the sentence would be executed, but not the death penalty sentence itself. The Court in Soering stressed however that the personal circumstances of the individual, including age and mental state (the individual in this case was 18 years old) were relevant in assessing whether their extradition would give rise to a real risk of treatment exceeding the threshold in Article 3.

=== Jurisdiction ===
Jurisdiction over a crime can be invoked to refuse extradition.

=== Own citizens ===
Several countries, such as Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czechia (the Czech Republic), France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Morocco, Norway, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Mainland China), Portugal, the Republic of China (Taiwan), Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Syria, Turkey, the UAE, and Vietnam have laws against extraditing their own citizens to other countries&#x27; jurisdictions. Instead, they often have special laws in place that give them jurisdiction over crimes committed abroad by or against citizens. By virtue of such jurisdiction, they can locally prosecute and try citizens accused of crimes committed abroad as if the crime had occurred within the country&#x27;s borders (see, e.g., trial of Xiao Zhen). Israeli law permits the extradition of Israeli citizens who have not established residency in Israel; resident citizens may be extradited to stand trial in a foreign country, provided that the prosecuting country agrees that any prison sentence imposed will be served in Israel.

=== Right to private and family life ===
In a limited number of cases Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights has been invoked to stop extradition from proceeding. Article 8 states that everyone has the right to the respect of their private and family life. This is achieved by way of balancing the potential harm to private life against the public interest in upholding the extradition arrangement. While this article is useful as it provide for a prohibition to extradition, the threshold required to meet this prohibition is high. Article 8 does explicitly provide that this right is subject to limits in the interests of national security and public safety, so these limits must be weighed in a balancing of priority against this right. Cases where extradition is sought usually involve serious crimes so while these limits are often justified there have been cases where extradition could not be justified in light of the individual&#x27;s family life. Cases to date have mostly involved dependant children where the extradition would be counter to the best interests of this child. In the case of &quot;FK v. Polish Judicial Authority&quot; the court held that it would violate article 8 for a mother of five young children to be extradited amidst charges of minor fraud which were committed a number of years ago. This case is an example of how the gravity of the crime for which extradition was sought was not proportionate to protecting the interests of the individual&#x27;s family. However the court in this case noted that even in circumstances where extradition is refused a custodial sentence will be given to comply with the principles of international comity. In contrast the case of &quot;HH v Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic, Genoa&quot; is an example of when the public interest for allowing extradition outweighed the best interests of the children. In this case both parents were being extradited to Italy for serious drug importation crimes.
Article 8 does not only address the needs of children, but also all family members, yet the high threshold required to satisfy Article 8 means that the vulnerability of children is the most likely circumstance to meet this threshold. In the case of &quot;Norris v US (No 2)&quot; a man sought to argue that if extradited his health would be undermined and it would cause his wife depression. This claim was rejected by the Court which stated that a successful claim under Article 8 would require &quot;exceptional&quot; circumstances.

Suicide Risk: Cases where there is risk of the individual committing suicide have also invoked article 8 as the public interest of extraditing must be considered in light of the risk of suicide by the individual if extradited. In the case of &quot;Jason&#x27;s v Latvia&quot; extradition was refused on these grounds, as the crime for which the individual was sought was not enough of a threat to public interest to outweigh the high risk of suicide which had been assessed to exist for the individual if extradited.

=== Fair trial standards ===
Consideration of the right to a fair trial is particularly complex in extradition cases. Its complexity arises from the fact that while the court deciding whether to surrender the individual must uphold these rights this same court must also be satisfied that any trial undertaken by the requesting state after extradition is granted also respects these rights. Article 14 of the ICCPR provides a number of criteria for fair trial standards. These standards have been reflected in courts who have shown that subjective considerations should be made in determining whether such trials would be ‘unjust’ or ‘oppressive’ by taking into account factors such as the duration of time since the alleged offences occurred, health of the individual, prison conditions in the requesting state and likelihood of conviction among other considerations. Yet exactly how the standards provided for in ICCPR are incorporated or recognised by domestic courts and decision makers is still unclear although it seems that these standards can at a minimum be used to inform the notions of such decision makers. If it is found that fair trial standards will not be satisfied in the requesting country this may be a sufficient bar to extradition.

Article 6 of the ECHR also provides for fair trial standards, which must be observed by European countries when making an extradition request. This court in the &quot;Othman&quot; case, whom if extradited would face trial where evidence against him had been obtained by way of torture. This was held to be a violation of Article 6 ECHR as it presented a real risk of a ‘flagrant denial of justice’. The court in Othman stressed that for a breach of Article 6 to occur the trial in the requesting country must constitute a flagrant denial of justice, going beyond merely an unfair trial. Evidence obtained by way of torture has been sufficient to satisfy the threshold of a flagrant denial of justice in a number of case. This is in part because torture evidence threatens the &quot;integrity of the trial process and the rule of law itself.&quot;

== Human rights and extradition ==
Human rights as a bar to extradition can be invoked in relation to the treatment of the individual in the receiving country, including their trial and sentence as well as the effect on family of the individual if extradition is granted. The repressive nature and the limitations of freedoms imposed on an individual is part of the extradition process and is the reason for these exceptions and the importance that human rights are observed in the extradition process. Therefore, human rights protected by international and regional agreements may be the basis for denying extradition requests, but only as independent exceptions. While human rights concerns can add to the complexity of extradition cases it is positive as it adds to the legitimacy and institutionalisation of the extradition system.

Determining whether to allow extradition by the requested state is, among other considerations, a balancing exercise between the interests of the requesting state&#x27;s pursuit of justice over the accused individuals, the requested state&#x27;s interests in holding dominion over those presently in its territory, and the rights of the extraditable persons. Extradition raises human rights concerns in determining this balance in relation to the extraditable person. States make provision to recognise these rights both expressing in bilateral treaty agreements and also, potentially by way of state&#x27;s obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is particularly relevant to extradition. Although regional, the European Convention of Human Rights has also been invoked as a bar to extradition in a number of cases falling within its jurisdiction and decisions from the European Court of Human Rights have been a useful source of development in this area.

== &quot;Aut dedere aut judicare&quot; ==
A concept related to extradition that has significant implications in transnational criminal law is that of &quot;aut dedere aut judicare&quot;. This maxim represents the principle that states must either surrender a criminal within their jurisdiction to a state that wishes to prosecute the criminal or prosecute the offender in its own courts. Many international agreements contain provisions for &quot;aut dedere aut judicare&quot;. These include all four 1949 Geneva Conventions, the U.N. Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the U.N. Convention Against Corruption, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of an Armed Conflict, and the International Convention for the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.

Some contemporary scholars hold the opinion that &quot;aut dedere aut judicare&quot; is not an obligation under customary international law but rather &quot;a specific conventional clause relating to specific crimes&quot; and, accordingly, an obligation that only exists when a state has voluntarily assumed the obligation. Cherif Bassiouni, however, has posited that, at least with regard to international crimes, it is not only a rule of customary international law but a &quot;jus cogens&quot; principle. Professor Michael Kelly, citing Israeli and Austrian judicial decisions, has noted that &quot;there is some supporting anecdotal evidence that judges within national systems are beginning to apply the doctrine on their own&quot;.

== Controversies ==

=== International tensions ===

The refusal of a country to extradite suspects or criminals to another may lead to international relations being strained. Often, the country to which extradition is refused will accuse the other country of refusing extradition for political reasons (regardless of whether or not this is justified). A case in point is that of Ira Einhorn, in which some US commentators pressured President Jacques Chirac of France, who does not intervene in legal cases, to permit extradition when the case was held up due to differences between French and American human rights law. Another long-standing example is Roman Polanski whose extradition was pursued by California for over 20 years. For a brief period he was placed under arrest in Switzerland, however subsequent legal appeals there prevented extradition.

The questions involved are often complex when the country from which suspects are to be extradited is a democratic country with a rule of law. Typically, in such countries, the final decision to extradite lies with the national executive (prime minister, president or equivalent). However, such countries typically allow extradition defendants recourse to the law, with multiple appeals. These may significantly slow down procedures. On the one hand, this may lead to unwarranted international difficulties, as the public, politicians and journalists from the requesting country will ask their executive to put pressure on the executive of the country from which extradition is to take place, while that executive may not in fact have the authority to deport the suspect or criminal on their own. On the other hand, certain delays, or the unwillingness of the local prosecution authorities to present a good extradition case before the court on behalf of the requesting state, may possibly result from the unwillingness of the country&#x27;s executive to extradite.

Even though the United States has an extradition treaty with Japan, most extraditions are not successful due to Japan&#x27;s domestic laws. For the United States to be successful, they must present their case for extradition to the Japanese authorities. However, certain evidence is barred from being in these proceedings such as the use of confessions, searches or electronic surveillance. In most cases involving international drug trafficking, this kind of evidence constitutes the bulk of evidence gathered in the investigation on a suspect for a drug-related charge. Therefore, this usually hinders the United States from moving forward with the extradition of a suspect.

There is at present controversy in the United Kingdom about the Extradition Act 2003, which dispenses with the need for a &quot;prima facie&quot; case for extradition. This came to a head over the extradition of the Natwest Three from the UK to the U.S., for their alleged fraudulent conduct related to Enron. Several British political leaders were heavily critical of the British government&#x27;s handling of the issue.

In 2013, the United States submitted extradition requests to many nations for former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden. It criticized Hong Kong for allowing him to leave despite an extradition request.

=== Extradition case of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou ===

It is a part of the China–United States trade war, which is political in nature.

=== 2019 Hong Kong extradition law protests ===

A proposed Hong Kong extradition law tabled in April 2019 led to one of the biggest protests in the city&#x27;s history, with 1 million demonstrators joining the protests on 9 June 2019. They took place three days before the Hong Kong government planned to bypass the committee process and bring the contentious bill straight to the full legislature to hasten its approval.

The bill, which would ease extradition to Mainland China, includes 37 types of crimes. While the Beijing-friendly ruling party maintains that the proposal contains protections of the dual criminality requirement and human rights, its opponents allege that after people are surrendered to the mainland, it could charge them with some other crime and impose the death penalty (which has been abolished in Hong Kong) for that other crime. There are also concerns about the retroactive effect of the new law.

The government&#x27;s proposal was amended to remove some categories after complaints from the business sector, such as &quot;the unlawful use of computers&quot;.

Experts have noted that the legal systems of mainland China and Hong Kong follow &#x27;different protocols&#x27; with regard to the important conditions of &quot;double criminality&quot; and non-refoulement, as well as on the matter of executive vs. judicial oversight on any extradition request.

=== Abductions ===

In some cases a state has abducted an alleged criminal from the territory of another state either after normal extradition procedures failed, or without attempting to use them. Notable cases are listed below:

=== &quot;Extraordinary rendition&quot; ===

&quot;Extraordinary rendition&quot; is an extrajudicial procedure in which criminal suspects, generally suspected terrorists or supporters of terrorist organisations, are transferred from one country to another. The procedure differs from extradition as the purpose of the rendition is to extract information from suspects, while extradition is used to return fugitives so that they can stand trial or fulfill their sentence. The United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) allegedly operates a global extraordinary rendition programme, which from 2001 to 2005 captured an estimated 150 people and transported them around the world.

The alleged US programme prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and illegal international transfers involving Council of Europe member states. A June 2006 report from the Council of Europe estimated 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory (with the cooperation of Council of Europe members), and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centres (&quot;black sites&quot;) used by the CIA, some of which could be located in Europe. According to the separate European Parliament report of February 2007, the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture. A large majority of the European Union Parliament endorsed the report&#x27;s conclusion that many member states tolerated illegal actions by the CIA, and criticised such actions. Within days of his inauguration, President Obama signed an Executive Order opposing rendition torture and established a task force to provide recommendations about processes to prevent rendition torture.

=== Uyghur extradition ===

In June 2021, CNN reported testimonies of several Uyghurs accounting for the detention and extradition of people they knew or were related to, from the United Arab Emirates. Documents issued by the Dubai public prosecutor and viewed by CNN, showed the confirmation of China’s request for the extradition of a detained Uyghur man, Ahmad Talip, despite insufficient proof of reasons for extradition.

In 2019, UAE, along with several other Muslim nations publicly endorsed China&#x27;s Xinjiang policies, despite Beijing being accused of genocide by the US State Department. Neither Dubai authorities nor the foreign ministry of UAE respond to the several requests for comment made by CNN on the detention and extradition of Uyghurs.

<text>The Pandavas (Sanskrit: पाण्डव, , IAST: Pāṇḍava) is a group name referring to the five legendary brothers, Yudhishtira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva, who are central figures of the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. They are acknowledged as the sons of Pandu, the King of Kuru, but were fathered by different &quot;Devas&quot; (gods) due to Pandu&#x27;s cursed inability to naturally conceive children. In the epic, the Pandavas married Draupadi, the princess of Panchala, and founded the city of Indraprastha after the Kuru Kingdom was split to avoid succession disputes. After the split, the other part of the kingdom was ruled by their cousins, the Kauravas. However, the Pandavas lost their kingdom to Duryodhana (eldest and king of the Kauravas) when Yudhishtira gambled it away during a game of dice. The bet Yudhishtira agreed to was that the Pandavas would hand the kingdom to the Kauravas and go into exile for 13 years. After this time the Kauravas refused to return the kingdom. As a result, the Pandavas waged a civil war against their extended family, and this conflict was known as the Kurukshetra War. With the help of the god Krishna, the Pandavas eventually won the war with the death of the Kauravas, albeit at great cost.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Pandava&quot; (, ) is derived from &quot;Pandu&quot; (, ) and means &quot;descendants of Pandu&quot;. Other epithets given to the Pandavas are:

* Pāṇḍuputra (Sanskrit: पाण्डुपुत्र) – sons of Pandu
* Pāṇḍavakumāra (Sanskrit: पाण्डवकुमार) – young Pandavas
* Kaunteya (Sanskrit: कौन्तेय) – sons of Kunti (Yudhishthira, Bheema, Arjuna).
* Mādreya (Sanskrit: माद्रेय) – sons of Madri (Nakula and Sahadeva)

==Description of the Pandavas==
The Pandava brothers had a group marriage to Draupadi. In the Section 268 of &quot;Vana Parva&quot; of the epic, Draupadi describes the Pandavas to Jayadratha after he abducted her forcefully and the Pandavas pursuit them.

* Yudhishthira was slender, and had a prominent nose, large eyes and a complexion like that of &quot;pure gold&quot;. He is also described as a just man, who had correct knowledge of the morality of his own acts and was merciful to surrendering foes.
* Bheema is described being fair-golden complexioned (&quot;Gaura&quot;), plump, long-armed and tall as a full grown Sala tree. He is also extolled to be strong, well-trained, endued with great might and his superhuman feats had earned him great renown. In a display of ferocity, he bit his lips, and contracted his forehead to bring the two eyebrows together. Bheema is also described to be frightful, who never forgot a foe and was not pacified even after he wreaked his vengeance.
* Arjuna is describing being dark complexioned (Syama), extremely handsome and praised as the greatest of archers, intelligent, second to none &quot;with senses under complete control.&quot; Neither lust nor fear nor anger could make him forsake virtue. Though capable of withstanding any foe, he would never commit an act of cruelty.
* Nakula was considered by Draupadi as &quot;the most handsome person in the whole world.&quot; An accomplished master swordsman, he was also &quot;versed in every question of morality and profit&quot; and &quot;endued with high wisdom.&quot; He was unflinchingly devoted to his brothers, who in turn regarded him as more valuable than their own lives.
* Sahadeva was heroic, intelligent, wise and no another man was equal unto him in intelligence or in eloquence amid assemblies of the wise. He was the one dearest to Kunti, and intent on doing what is agreeable to Yudhishthira. He is also praised to be always mindful of the duties of Kshatriyas (warrior -class), and would sacrifice his own life than say anything that is opposed to morals.

==Legend==
===Birth and parentage===

According to the &quot;Adi Parva&quot; of the epic, Pandu was crowned as the king of the Kuru Kingdom despite being younger than his elder brother Dhritrashtra, who was denied the throne for being blind. He married Kunti, a princess of the Yadu clan, and Madri, the princess of Madra Kingdom. Once he was hunting in a forest when he shot a copulating pair of deer. However, they turn out to be a sage named Kindama and his wife, who had used their divine powers to take the form of the animals. Enraged, Kindama berated the king for having killed him before he had finished the act of mating and before dying, he cursed Pandu that he would die the moment he touched his wife intending to make love. After the event Pandu voluntarily renounced royal life as penance, leaving the Kingdom under Dhritarashtra. Kunti and Madri accompanied Pandu and together they lived in a forest.

Before her marriage, Kunti was blessed with a boon by the sage Durvasa, that she could have a son by any god whom she respects without having any marital affair. After Pandu learned of this, he asked her to perform &quot;Niyoga&quot; and bear him sons using the boon. The first three of the Pandavas were the sons of Kunti, while the younger two were born to Madri after Kunti shared her mantra with her at Pandu&#x27;s request. The divine fathers of the Pandavas were: 
* Dharmadeva, the god of &quot;dharma&quot;, who fathered Yudhishthira 
* Vayu, the god of wind, who fathered Bheema
* Indra, the god of rain and the king of gods, who fathered Arjuna
* The Ashvins, the twin gods of health and medicine, who fathered the twins Nakula and Sahadeva.

===Upbringing and rivalry with the Kauravas===
A few years later after the birth of the Pandavas, Pandu died after trying to have a union with Madri and the latter immolated herself out of remorse. Kunti brought the Pandavas back to Hastinapura, the capital of Kuru, and they were raised together with their cousins, the Kauravas, who were the hundred sons of Dhritrashtra. The Pandavas were guided and taught by Bheeshma, Vidura and Kripa.

Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, refused to accept the Pandavas as his cousins. This usually led to much tension between the cousins. Insecure and jealous, Duryodhana harbored an intense hatred for the five brothers throughout his childhood and youth and following the advice of his maternal uncle Shakuni, often plotted to get rid of them to clear his path to the lordship of the Kuru Dynasty.
This plotting took a grave turn when Dhritarashtra had to relent to the will of the masses and rightfully appointed his nephew Yudhishthira as crown prince. This went against the personal ambitions of both father and son (Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana) and drove Duryodhana into such a rage that he enthusiastically agreed to an evil ploy by Shakuni to murder Yudhishthira. Shakuni commissioned the construction of a palace in Varnavart, secretly built by incorporating flammable materials like oil, ghee etc. into the structure, most notably the lacquer known as lac. This palace was known as Lakshagraha. Duryodhana then successfully lobbied Dhritarashtra to send Yudhishthira to represent the royal household in Varnavarta during the celebrations of Shiva Mahotsava. The plan was to set the palace on fire during the night while Yudhishthira would likely be asleep. Yudhishthira left for Varnavrata, accompanied by his four brothers and their mother Kunti. The plan was discovered by their paternal uncle Vidura, who was very loyal to them and an extraordinarily wise man. In addition, Yudhishthira had been forewarned about this plot by a hermit who came to him and spoke of an imminent disaster. Vidura arranged for a tunnel to be secretly built for the Pandavas to safely escape the palace as it was set afire.

===Marriages and children===
The Pandavas had polyandrous marriage with Draupadi, the princess of Panchala Kingdom who was prophesied to bring the end of the Kauravas. The &quot;Adi Parva&quot; narrates that after their flight from the palace, the five brothers lived in the forests for some time disguised as Brahmins. They heard from a group of travelling sages about a contest (Svayamvara) being held in the Kingdom of Panchala that offered Draupadi&#x27;s hand in marriage to the winner. The Svayamvara turned out to rely on the skills of archery, and Arjuna, who was a peerless archer, entered the competition and won. When the brothers took Draupadi to introduce her to their mother, they jokingly announced to Kunti that they had arrived with excellent alms. Kunti was busy with some work and replied without turning to look at Draupadi (who the alms referred to) ordering the brothers to share the alms equally amongst the five of them. Even when uttered erroneously, their mother&#x27;s word was supreme for the Pandavas, and they agreed to share the princess, who was subsequently married to all five brothers. To prevent jealousy among the brothers and identify the paternity of Draupadi&#x27;s children, the Pandavas followed a condition in which one brother was given a year with her and others were forbidden to enter her chamber. If the condition was violated, the brother, who entered the room, had to go on a pilgrimage for 12 years. Arjuna was the only one to violate this condition. 

Each Pandava had a son with Draupadi and they were collectively referred to as Upapandavas; their names were Prativindhya (fathered by Yudhishthira), Sutasoma (fathered by Bhima), Shrutakarma (fathered by Arjuna), Shatanika (fathered by Nakula), and Shrutasena (fathered by Sahadeva).

Besides Draupadi, each Pandava had their own wife with whom they had a son:
* Yudhishthira was also married to Devika, the daughter of the king of the Sivi Kingdom, and had a son named Yaudheya.
* Bheema had two other wives—the Rakshasi (demoness) Hidimbi and Valandhara, a princess of the Kingdom of Kashi. Hidimbi was the mother of Ghatotkacha, while Savarga was the son of Valandhara.
* Arjuna had three other wives—Uloopi, a Naga woman with whom he had Iravan; Chitrangada, the princess of Manipur, who became the mother of Babruvahana; and Subhadra, the sister of Krishna and the mother of Abhimanyu.
* Nakula had a wife named Karenumati, daughter of king of Chedi, and had a son named Niramitra.
* Sahadeva was married to Vijaya, princess of Madra, and had a son named Suhotra.

===Indraprastha===
When Dhritarashtra heard that the five brothers were alive, he invited them back to the kingdom. However, in their absence, Duryodhana had succeeded in being made the crown prince. Upon the return of the Pandavas, the issue of returning Yudhishthira&#x27;s crown to him was raised. Dhritarashtra led the subsequent discussions into ambiguity and agreed to a partition of the kingdom &quot;to do justice to both crown princes&quot;. He retained the developed Hastinapura for himself and Duryodhana and gave the barren, arid and hostile lands of Khandavaprastha to the Pandavas. The Pandavas successfully developed their land and built a great and lavish city, which was considered comparable to the heavens, and thus came to be known as Indraprastha.
===The game of dice===

Reeling under the loss of half the lands of his future kingdom, Duryodhana&#x27;s jealousy and rage were further fuelled by the Pandavas&#x27; success and prosperity. Eventually Shakuni sired yet another plot and got Duryodhana to invite the Pandavas over to his court for a game of dice (gambling). Shakuni was a master at gambling and owned a pair of dice which magically did his bidding. Owing to this, bet after bet, Yudhishthira lost all of his wealth, and eventually his kingdom, in the game. He was then enticed by Duryodhana and Shakuni to place his brothers as bets. Yudhishthira fell for it and put his brothers at stake, losing them too. He then placed himself as a bet and lost again. Duryodhana now played another trick and told Yudhishthira that he still had his wife Draupadi to place as a bet and if Yudhishthira won, he would return everything to the Pandavas. Yudhishthira fell for the ruse and bet Draupadi, losing her too. At this point, Duryodhana ordered that Draupadi, who was now a slave to him, be brought to the court. None of the Pandavas fought for their wife&#x27;s honour. Duryodhana&#x27;s younger brother Dushasana dragged Draupadi to the royal court, pulling her by her hair, insulting her dignity and asserting that she, like the Pandava brothers, was now their servant. This caused immense anguish to all the great warriors seated in the court, but each of them, namely, Bheeshma (grandsire of the clan), Dronacharya (teacher/guru of Kauravas and Pandavas) and Kripacharya except Vidura remained silent. Duryodhana then ordered Dushasana to disrobe Draupadi before everyone, as a slave girl has no rights. The elders and warriors in the audience were shocked but did not intervene. As Dushasana began to disrobe her, she prayed to Krishna to protect her honour. Krishna, using his divine powers, protected her by providing her garments with an unending length. Dushasana, shocked and tired, gave up on disrobing Draupadi. Finally, as the blind king Dhritarashtra realized that this humiliation could prompt Draupadi to curse his sons, he intervened, apologizing to Draupadi for the behaviour of his sons, and turned the winnings of the dice game back over to the Pandava brothers, releasing them from the bondage of slavery.
Incensed at the loss of all that he had won, Duryodhana threatened suicide and coerced his father into inviting the Pandavas for one last round of gambling, the terms of which were that the loser would be condemned to 12 years of exile into forests and a 13th year to be spent incognito, and if the cover is blown during the 13th year, another cycle of 13 years would ensue. Obeying their uncle&#x27;s orders, the Pandavas played the round and again lost to Shakuni&#x27;s cheating. However, this time, their patience had been nearly pushed to its edge.

===Exile and incognito period===
During the 12 years of exile in the forest, they prepared for war. Arjuna performed penance and won the entire gamut of celestial weapons (Divyastras) as boons from the Gods. They spent the 13th year in Agyaata Vaasa masquerading as peasants in the service of the royal family of Virata, the king of Matsya. Upon completion of the terms of the last bet, the Pandavas returned and demanded that their kingdom be rightfully returned to them. Duryodhana refused to yield Indraprastha. For the sake of peace and to avert a disastrous war, Krishna proposed that if Hastinapura agrees to give the Pandavas only five villages named Indraprastha (Delhi), Swarnprastha (Sonipat), Panprastha (Panipat), Vyaghrprastha (Baghpat) and Tilprastha (Tilpat) if these five villages given they would be satisfied and would make no more demands. Duryodhana vehemently refused, commenting that he would not part even with land as much as the point of a needle. Thus the stage was set for the great war, for which the epic of Mahabharata is known most of all.
===Krishna&#x27;s help to Pandavas===
Krishna, being a well-wisher of the Pandavas, helped them in various ways during the time of their ordeals. When the Kurukshetra war was going to be held, both Arjuna on behalf of the Pandavas, and Duryodhana on behalf of the Kauravas, went to Krishna to seek help.
Duryodhana reached first and Arjuna was just behind him. They entered Krishna&#x27;s room and found him sleeping. Duryodhana sat on a raised chair near Krishna&#x27;s head and Arjuna sat near Krishna&#x27;s feet closing his hands.
When Krishna woke up, he saw Arjuna first and asked him about the purpose of his visit. Then he found Duryodhana sitting next to him, and asked him the same question. Krishna was then told that war was going to be held and Arjuna and Duryodhana had come to him seeking his military help. To this Krishna replied that he had seen Arjuna first and so he would give him priority, and asked what he needed. He gave Arjuna two options – either his army of 100,000 soldiers or Krishna himself who shall not fight in the war. To this Arjuna immediately opted for Krishna for his help and thus Duryodhana was given Krishna&#x27;s army. Duryodhana was very satisfied to have received a huge army.

===The Kurukshetra War===
The war was intense and lasted 18 days, over the course of which both parties worked around, bent and even broke rules of warfare. In the end, all 100 Kaurava brothers and their entire army was slain, with only three surviving on their side. The Pandavas too lost several allies but the five brothers survived. After having won the war, Yudhishthira was crowned the king.
At the end of the war, only 10 survived the war on both sides, namely Ashwatthama, Kripacharya and Kritverma on the Kaurava side and the five Pandavas, Krishna and Saatyakee on the Pandava side.

===Later life===
The Pandavas ruled Hastinapura for 36 years and established a righteous kingdom. Shortly after Krishna left the Earth, they all decided that the time had come for them to renounce the world, as the age of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; had started.

So the five Pandavas and Draupadi left to the path of liberation. For this purpose, they all climbed Mount Kailash, which leads to the Swarga Loka. On their way, all except Yudhisthira slipped and died one by one. Yudhisthira was accompanied by a dog who was none other than God Yama himself.

The first to die was Draupadi; she was imperfect because she loved Arjuna more than her other husbands. Then it was Sahadeva, imperfect because he was overconfident about his knowledge in science. He was followed by Nakula, imperfect because he was over-enthusiastic about his good looks. Then fell Arjuna, imperfect because he was proud of his skills—he challenged Hanuman and Shiva. Next was Bheema, imperfect because he killed his enemies brutally—thus enjoyed their sufferings. Only the eldest Pandava, Yudhisthira, reached the door of Svarga Loka (heaven), carried on Indra&#x27;s chariot. On reaching Heaven, he did not find either his virtuous brothers or his wife Draupadi. Instead, he finds Karna sitting on a divine throne.

He wanted an explanation from Yama, the lord of death. Yama explained that the Kauravas had been allowed into heaven because they died as warriors on the battlefield. This earned them so much merit and credit that it wiped out all their debts. Yudhisthira demanded to know where his brothers and his wife were. He was then taken to hell. Yama explained that they were experiencing the reactions of their actions but it was temporary. Once the debt had been repaid, they would join them in Swarga. Yudhisthira loyally met his brothers, but the sight and sound of gore and blood horrified him. Though initially he was tempted to flee, he mastered himself and remained after hearing the voices of his beloved brothers and Draupadi calling out to him, asking him to stay with them in their misery. Yudhisthira decided to remain, ordering the divine charioteer to return. He preferred to live in hell with good people than in the heaven of his enemies. Eventually, this turned out to be another illusion to test him. Yama explained to Yudhishtira that it was all illusion created by Yama himself. It was a punishment to Yudhishtira to feel sad and soak tears on seeing his beloved ones being punished. It was because Drona felt sad on hearing fake news that his son was dead. Yudhishtira told the message incompletely due to which Drona felt sad and cried in grief. Because of this, Yudhishtira had to feel sad in a similar manner. Hence Yama created this illusion. In reality, Pandavas and Draupadi reached heaven just after their deaths. Yama explained everything and Yudhishtira reached heaven with his mortal body. Pandavas were the incarnation of previous Indra&#x27;s. After the Duration, the lifespan of Indra, is completed Krishna assures Pandavas of offering them Moksha for their Devotion and purity.
==In art==
Harivamsa Purana (8th century CE) narrates the Jain version of their story. In the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, there has been a long tradition of villagers performing the &quot;Pandav Lila&quot;, a ritual re-enactment of episodes from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; through singing, dancing and recitation. In the performance, the actors spontaneously break into a dance when, it is believed, they become &quot;possessed&quot; by the spirits of their characters.

<doc id="239652" wikidata="Q1511328" url="?curid=239652" title="Hodag">
<text>In American folklore, the hodag is a fearsome critter resembling a large bull-horned carnivore with a row of thick curved spines down its back. The hodag was said to be born from the ashes of cremated oxen, as the incarnation of the accumulation of abuse the animals had suffered at the hands of their masters. The history of the hodag is strongly tied to Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where it was claimed to have been discovered. The hodag has figured prominently in early Paul Bunyan stories.

==Origins==
In 1893, newspapers reported the discovery of a hodag in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The articles claimed the hodag had &quot;the head of a frog, the grinning face of a giant elephant, thick short legs set off by huge claws, the back of a dinosaur, and a long tail with spears at the end&quot;. The reports were instigated by well-known Wisconsin land surveyor, timber cruiser and prankster Eugene Shepard, who rounded up a group of local people to capture the animal. The group reported that they needed to use dynamite to kill the beast.

A photograph of the remains of the charred beast was released to the media. It was &quot;the fiercest, strangest, most frightening monster ever to set razor sharp claws on the earth. It became extinct after its main food source, all white bulldogs, became scarce in the area.&quot;

==Hoax==
Shepard claimed to have captured another hodag in 1896, and this one was captured alive. According to Shepard&#x27;s reports, he and several bear wrestlers placed chloroform on the end of a long pole, which they worked into the cave of the creature where it was overcome.

He displayed this hodag at the first Oneida County fair. Thousands of people came to see the hodag at the fair or at Shepard&#x27;s display in a shanty at his house. Having connected wires to it, Shepard would occasionally move the creature, which would typically send the already-skittish viewers fleeing the display.

As newspapers locally, statewide, and then nationally began picking up the story of the apparently remarkable living creature, a small group of scientists from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. announced they would be traveling to Rhinelander to inspect the apparent discovery. Their mere announcement spelled the end, as Shepard was then forced to admit that the hodag was a hoax.

==Legacy==

The hodag became the official symbol of Rhinelander, Wisconsin. It is the mascot of Rhinelander High School, and lends its name to numerous Rhinelander area businesses and organizations, including the annual music festival, Hodag Country Festival. The city of Rhinelander&#x27;s web site calls Rhinelander &quot;The Home of the Hodag&quot;. A larger-than-life fiberglass sculpture of a hodag, created by Tracy Goberville, a local artist, resides on the grounds of the Rhinelander Area Chamber of Commerce where it draws thousands of visitors each year. Rhinelander Ice Arena houses two hodags, one a full body creature just inside the entrance, and the other one an oversized head that blows smoke and has red eyes that light up, located in the corner just off the ice and which was created by the same artist who designed and built the Chamber Hodag.

<text>The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) () is a decentralised agency of the EU responsible for the registration of EU-wide unitary trade marks and industrial design rights. These exist alongside the intellectual property rights of individual EU member states, so the agency also works to harmonise EU-wide and national registration processes. Other responsibilities include the administration of the rights of certain products in the EU to carry geographical indications.

EUIPO was founded in 1994 and was formerly known as the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), but was renamed in March 2016 to reflect major reforms. The EUIPO is based in Alicante, Spain.

==Functions and activities==
=== Intellectual property registration ===
The Office is in charge of managing the registration of the EU trade mark and the registered Community design and offers businesses and citizens exclusive rights for trade mark and design protection throughout the European Union (EU), with a single application. Every year, it registers an average of 135,000 EU trade marks and close to 100,000 designs.
The European Union trade mark (EUTM) (formerly known as &quot;community trade mark&quot;) grants exclusive rights in all current and future Member States of the European Union through a single registration, filed online. The basic registration fee is EUR 850 and it covers one class of goods and services. An EU trade mark registration lasts for 10 years but can be renewed indefinitely in blocks of 10 years.

The registered Community design (RCD) also grants exclusive rights throughout the European Union and future Member States. The fee for registering and publishing one design is EUR 350. A registered Community design is initially valid for five years from the date of filing and can be renewed in blocks of five years up to a maximum of 25 years.

Its work also includes the harmonisation of registration practices for trade marks and designs and the development of common intellectual property (IP) management tools. This work is carried out in cooperation with the national and regional IP offices throughout the EU-27, user associations and other institutional partners with the objective of offering users of the trade mark and design system a similar registration experience, be it at national or at EU level. The agency works in five languages (English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) but processes trade mark and design applications in 23 official languages of the EU.

===Geographical Indication===
EUIPO administers geographical indication (GI) registration in the EU for agricultural products whose qualities are specifically linked to their area of production (e.g. certain wines and cheeses) and provides a database of registered GIs. On 16 November 2023, a new EU regulation entered into force which introduced a new geographical indication (GI) protection scheme for craft and industrial products in the EU and giving EUIPO the authority to administer it. From 1 December 2025, the EUIPO will be responsible for the registration of geographical indications (GIs) for craft and industrial products. It will be possible to file applications for the registration of names of craft and industrial products meeting the necessary requirements in the EU.

===Other activities===
Since 2012, the EUIPO has managed the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, a network of public and private stakeholders working against piracy and counterfeiting.

Additionally, the EUIPO is charged with establishing and managing portals on EU Orphan Works and EU Out of Commerce works, including a database to register these types of works.

The DesignEuropa Awards are organised by the EUIPO every two years to celebrate excellence in design and design management among registered Community design (RCD) holders, whether they are individual rights holders, small businesses or large enterprises. The first edition of the awards took place in Milan in 2016.

==History of key regulations==

The regulation establishing the EUIPO was adopted by the Council of the European Union in December 1993 and revised on two occasions, in 2009 and in 2015. It created the European Union trade mark (formerly known as the Community trade mark) as a legal instrument in European Union law and established the EUIPO (then known as Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, or OHIM) as an EU agency with legal, administrative and financial autonomy. Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 created the registered Community design.

On 23 March 2016, the Office changed its name to the European Union Intellectual Property Office upon the entry into force of Regulation 2015/2424. The Regulation brought about changes in three areas:

# Trade mark fees: The fee system changed from a basic fee that covered up to three classes of goods and services to a &#x27;pay-per-class&#x27; system, with an online fee of EUR 850 for one class, EUR 50 for the second class, and EUR 150 each for three or more classes.
# Technical: As well as changes in the graphic representation of the mark, examination proceedings, absolute grounds of refusal, relative grounds of refusal, goods and services, opposition and cancellation proceedings and appeals. It also created the certification mark system, permitting certifying institutions to use a new type of trade mark at EU level for goods or services complying with certification requirements.
# Institutional: The Regulation clearly defined all the tasks of the EUIPO, including the framework for cooperation and convergence of practices with national and regional IP offices in the EU.

In 2017 this was replaced by Regulation (EU) 2017/1001, which consolidated and updated the previous regulations.

On 23 March 2016, the agency changed its name to the European Union Intellectual Property Office upon the entry into force of Regulation 2015/2424. Several positions and the governing board were also renamed to mirror these changes; for example, the title of the head of the agency was changed from President to Executive Director.

A new EU Regulation on geographical indication protection for craft and industrial products was published on 27 October 2023 and entered into force on 16 November 2023. Producers and manufacturers of these products will be able to file applications for GI protection with the EUIPO from 1 December 2025.

== Governance and structure ==
The governance structure of the EUIPO consists of a management board and a Budget Committee, each composed of one representative from each Member State, two representatives from the European Commission and one representative from the European Parliament.

The Council of the European Union decides on the appointment of the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, and the President and Chairpersons of the Boards of Appeal.

=== Boards of Appeal ===

The OHIM Board of Appeal is an administrative law body of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), which is responsible for deciding on appeals in trade mark and design matters registered in the European Union. They are able to make decisions based on points of law and points of fact.

The Boards of Appeal are headed by the President of the Boards of Appeal, appointed by the Council of Ministers from a list prepared by the Administrative Board of OHIM.

The individual Boards are chaired by members appointed by the Council of Ministers. Other members of individual Boards are appointed by the Administrative Board of OHIM. Boards are allowed to hear new evidence at their discretion, although not obligated to do so.
The Boards of Appeal are made up of four Boards for trade mark cases and one for design. There is an additional Grand Board which may hear any cases appealed through OHIM. A case heard by a Board of Appeal is made up of three members. This includes the Chairperson, who must sit on every case. Two members of the Board must be legally qualified, though in some instances cases can be decided by the Grand Board or a single member. 
The Grand Board is made up of nine members. It includes the presidents and chairpersons of the Boards, as well as some ordinary board members. The Board was set up by Council Regulation 422/2004. Cases are referred to the Grand Board based on legal difficulty, importance, or under special circumstances. In some cases, the Presidium may refer a case to the Grand Board.

The Presidium oversees the rules and organisation of the Boards of Appeal. It consists of the President of the Boards of Appeal, the Chairpersons of the Boards, and three board members elected for a calendar year.

<doc id="239662" wikidata="Q441464" url="?curid=239662" title="Germanus I of Constantinople">
<text>Germanus I of Constantinople (, Greek: Γερμανός; 634 – 742) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 715 to 730. He is regarded as a saint by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches, with a feast day of 12 May. He had been ecumenically preceded by Patriarch John VI of Constantinople, and was succeeded in Orthodox Rite by Patriarch Anastasius of Constantinople.

== Life ==
According to Theophanes the Confessor, Germanus I was a son of a patrician named Justinian, who was executed in 668. Justinian was reportedly involved in the murder of Constans II and usurpation of the throne by Mizizios. Emperor Constantine IV, son of Constans II, defeated his rival and punished the supporters of Mizizios. Germanus I survived the persecutions but was made a eunuch by the victors.

Germanus I was sent to a monastery but resurfaced as the Bishop of Cyzicus. He took part in the Council of Constantinople in 712, a gathering which issued decisions favoring Monothelitism, thereby abolishing the canons of the Third Council of Constantinople (680–681). The Council followed the religious preferences of Emperor Philippicus.

In 713, Philippicus was deposed by Anastasius II. Anastasius II soon reversed all religious decisions of his predecessor. Patriarch John VI of Constantinople, strongly associated with Monothelitism, was eventually dismissed. On 11 August 715, Germanus I was elected Patriarch of Constantinople. Germanus I later helped negotiate Anastasius II&#x27;s surrender terms to Theodosius III.

In 715, Germanus I organized a new council propagating Dyothelitism and anathematising various leaders of the opposing faction. He attempted to improve relations with the Armenian Apostolic Church with a view towards reconciliation. The major issue of his term would, however, be the emerging Byzantine Iconoclasm, propagated by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian. Germanus I was an iconodule, and played an important role in defending the use of sacred images during the iconoclastic crisis of his day. For his opposition to the emperor, who considered reverence for these images a form of idolatry, Germanus I suffered exile.

After an apparently successful attempt to enforce the baptism of all Jews and Montanists in the empire (722), Leo III issued a series of edicts against the worship of images (726–729). A letter by the patriarch Germanus I written before 726 to two Iconoclast bishops says that &quot;now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter&quot;, but little evidence is extant as to the growth of the debate.

Germanus I resigned following the ban. Surviving letters Germanus I wrote at the time say little of theology. According to Patricia Karlin-Hayter, what worried Germanus I was that the ban of icons would prove that the Church had been in error for a long time and therefore play into the hands of Jews and Muslims. Tradition depicts Germanus I as much more determined in his position, even winning a debate on the matter with Constantine, Bishop of Nacoleia, a leading Iconoclast. Pope Gregory II (715–731), a fellow iconodule, praised Germanus I&#x27;s &quot;zeal and steadfastness&quot;.

Germanus I was replaced by Patriarch Anastasius of Constantinople, who was more willing to obey the emperor. Germanus I retired to the residence of his family and died a few years later at an advanced age in 742. He was buried at the Chora Church. The Second Council of Nicaea (787) included Germanus I in the diptychs of the saints. He has since been regarded as a saint by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church.

Several of his writings have been preserved. His &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; was a popular work in Greek and Latin translations for many centuries, and remains often quoted by scholars. Parts of it were published in English in 1985 as &quot;On the Divine Liturgy&quot;, described by its publishers as &quot;for centuries the quasi-official explanation of the Divine Liturgy for the Byzantine Christian world&quot;. However, the church historian Johann Peter Kirsch was dubious that the work is actually by Germanus I.

== Influence ==
Pope Pius XII included one of his texts in the apostolic constitution proclaiming Mary&#x27;s assumption into heaven a dogma of the Church.

Among his writings was the hymn &quot;Μέγα καί παράδοξον θαῦμα&quot; translated by John Mason Neale as &quot;A Great and Mighty Wonder&quot;, although John Mason Neale misattributed this to Anatolius of Constantinople.

<text>Diane Ladd (born Rose Diane Ladner; November 29, 1935) is an American actress. She has appeared in over 200 films and television shows. She received three Academy Award nominations for her roles in &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974), &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), and &quot;Rambling Rose&quot; (1991), the first of which won her a British Academy Film Award. She was also nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards, winning one for her role in the sitcom &quot;Alice&quot; (1980–1981).

Ladd&#x27;s other film appearances include &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (1996), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;28 Days&quot; (2000), and &quot;Joy&quot; (2015). She is the mother of actress Laura Dern, with her ex-husband, actor Bruce Dern.

==Personal life==
Ladd was born Rose Diane Ladner, the only child of Mary Bernadette Ladner ( Anderson), a housewife and actress, and Preston Paul Ladner, a veterinarian who sold products for poultry and livestock. She was born in Laurel, Mississippi on November 29, 1935, while the family was visiting relatives for Thanksgiving, though they lived in Meridian, Mississippi. Ladd is related to playwright Tennessee Williams and poet Sidney Lanier. Ladd was raised in her mother&#x27;s Catholic faith.

Ladd was married to actor and one-time co-star Bruce Dern from 1960 to 1969. They had two daughters, Diane Elizabeth, who died at age eighteen months after a drowning accident, and Laura Elizabeth, who became an actress. Ladd and Laura Dern co-starred in the films &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, &quot;Rambling Rose&quot;, &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; and &quot;Inland Empire&quot;, and in the HBO series &quot;Enlightened&quot;. The two also appeared together in &quot;White Lightning&quot; and &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;, although Laura was uncredited in both.

Ladd was previously married to William A. Shea Jr. from 1969 to 1977. She married her current husband, Robert Charles Hunter, in 1999. Ladd was supportive of Jesse Jackson&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign.

In 2018, Ladd was misdiagnosed with pneumonia and given six months to a year to live after she inhaled &quot;poison spray&quot; from the farms neighboring her home, constricting her esophagus. Her daughter, Laura, transferred her to another hospital where she made a full recovery.

==Career==
In 1971, Ladd joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;. She was the second actress to play the role of Kitty Styles on the long-running daytime serial. She later had a supporting role in Roman Polanski&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her role as Flo in the film &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. That film inspired the television series &quot;Alice&quot;, in which Flo was portrayed by Polly Holliday. When Holliday left the TV series, Ladd succeeded her as waitress Isabelle &quot;Belle&quot; Dupree.
Her subsequent film appearances include &quot;Black Widow&quot; (1987), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (1996), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;28 Days&quot; (2000), and &quot;Joy&quot; (2015). She appeared in the independent screwball comedy &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me&quot; in 1992, where she played a flirty, aging Southern belle alongside her real mother, actress Mary Lanier.

In 2004, Ladd played psychic Mrs. Druse in the television miniseries of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot;. In April 2006, Ladd released her first book, &quot;Spiraling Through The School of Life: A Mental, Physical, and Spiritual Discovery&quot;. In 2007, she co-starred in the Lifetime Television film &quot;Montana Sky&quot;.

In addition to her Academy Award nomination for &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;, she was also nominated (again in the Best Actress in a Supporting Role category) for both &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; and &quot;Rambling Rose&quot;, both of which she starred alongside her daughter Laura Dern. Dern received a nomination for Best Actress for &quot;Rambling Rose&quot;. The dual mother and daughter nominations for Ladd and Dern in &quot;Rambling Rose&quot; marked the first time in Academy Awards history that such an event had occurred. They were also nominated for dual Golden Globe Awards in the same year.

Ladd has also worked in theatre. She made her Broadway debut in &quot;Carry Me Back to Morningside Heights&quot; in 1968. In 1976, she starred in &quot;A Texas Trilogy: Lu Ann Hampton Laverty Oberlander&quot;, for which she received a Drama Desk Award nomination.

On November 1, 2010, Ladd, Laura Dern, and Bruce Dern received adjoining stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; this is the first time family members have been given such consideration on the Walk. Ladd&#x27;s star is the 2,421st.

She starred in the Hallmark Channel series &quot;Chesapeake Shores&quot;.

<doc id="239669" wikidata="Q156600" url="?curid=239669" title="Anatolius of Constantinople">
<text>Anatolius of Constantinople (; died 3 July 458) was a Patriarch of Constantinople (November 449 – 3 July 458). He is regarded as a saint, by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches.

== Life ==
Anatolius was born at Alexandria. He was ordained a deacon by Cyril of Alexandria, and was present at the Council of Ephesus in the year 431.

He became Patriarch through the influence of Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria and Emperor Theodosius II, following the deposition of Flavian of Constantinople by the Second Council of Ephesus in 449. Prior to his elevation, he had served as the apocrisiarius (representative) of Dioscorus with the emperor at Constantinople. After his consecration, Anatolius, being under suspicion of Eutychianism, publicly condemned the teachings of both Eutyches and Nestorius, subscribing to the letters of Cyril of Alexandria against Nestorius and of Pope Leo I against Eutyches.

In conjunction with Pope Leo I, according to Joannes Zonaras (&quot;Annals&quot;, iii), he requested that Emperor Marcian summon a general council against Dioscorus I and the Eutychians, but the Imperial letter instructing Anatolius on preparations for the Council of Chalcedon only mentions Pope Leo I (Philippe Labbe, &quot;Conc. Max. Tom.&quot;, iv). During the council, Anatolius presided alongside the Roman legates (Labbe, Conc. Max. iv; Evagr. H. E., ii, 4, 18; Niceph. H. E., xv, 18).

By the famous 28th canon, passed at the conclusion of the council, Constantinople was granted equal dignity with Rome, being declared &quot;second in eminence and power to the Bishop of Rome&quot;. This change displaced the traditional hierarchy of authority of the much older sees of Antioch and Alexandria. As a result, controversy emerged between Anatolius and the Roman pontiff. However, the third canon of the earlier First Council of Constantinople of 381 had already stated that &quot;The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honour after the Bishop of Rome because Constantinople is New Rome&quot;. The Eastern position in this dispute could be characterised as being political in nature, as opposed to a doctrinal view.

Pope Leo I complained to Marcian (Ep. 54) and to Pulcheria (Ep. 55) that Anatolius had outstepped his jurisdiction by consecrating Maximus II of Antioch as Patriarch of Antioch, as well as protesting to Anatolius (Ep. 53).

Following the council of Chalcedon, Anatolius received a letter signed by several Egyptian bishops, requesting his assistance against Timothy II of Alexandria, who was usurping the Patriarch of Alexandria (Labbe, Conc. Max., iv, iii, 23, p. 897). In response, Anatolius wrote to emperor Leo I against Timothy (Labbe, iii, 26, p. 905). The circular of the emperor requesting the advice of Anatolius on the turbulent state of Alexandria is given by Evagrius Scholasticus (H. E., ii, 9), and by Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos (H. E., xv, 18). Edward Gibbon states that the crowning of Leo I on his accession by Anatolius is the first instance of the kind on record (Theophanes the Confessor, &quot;Chronicle&quot;, p. 95). When he was near death he was restored to health by Daniel the Stylite, who traveled to Constantinople to see him.

It is also said that the followers of Dioscorus I were responsible for his death in 458.

Anatolius was credited with composing a few hymns.

<text>Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (, ; 138–78 BC), commonly known as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He won the first major civil war in Roman history and became the first man of the Republic to seize power through force.

Sulla held the office of consul twice and revived the dictatorship. A gifted general, he achieved successes in wars against foreign and domestic opponents. Sulla rose to prominence during the war against the Numidian king Jugurtha, whom he captured as a result of Jugurtha&#x27;s betrayal by the king&#x27;s allies, although his superior Gaius Marius took credit for ending the war. He then fought successfully against Germanic tribes during the Cimbrian War, and Italian allies during the Social War. He was awarded the Grass Crown for his bravery at the Battle of Nola. Sulla was closely associated with Venus, adopting the title Epaphroditos meaning favoured of Aphrodite/Venus.

Sulla played an important role in the long political struggle between the &quot;optimates&quot; and &quot;populares&quot; factions at Rome. He was a leader of the &quot;optimates&quot;, who sought to maintain senatorial supremacy against the populist reforms advocated by the &quot;populares&quot;, headed by Marius. In a dispute over the command of the war against Mithridates, initially awarded to Sulla by the Senate but withdrawn as a result of Marius&#x27; intrigues, Sulla marched on Rome in an unprecedented act and defeated Marian forces in battle. The &quot;populares&quot; seized power once he left with his army to Asia. He returned victorious from the east in 82 BC, marched on Rome again and crushed the &quot;populares&quot; and their Italian allies at the Battle of the Colline Gate.

Sulla revived the office of dictator, which had been dormant since the Second Punic War, over a century before. He used his powers to purge his opponents, and reform Roman constitutional laws, to restore the primacy of the Senate and limit the power of the tribunes of the plebs. Resigning his dictatorship in 79 BC, Sulla retired to private life and died the following year. Later political leaders such as Julius Caesar followed the precedent set by Sulla with his military coup to attain political power through force.

==Family and youth==
Sulla, the son of Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the grandson of Publius Cornelius Sulla, was born into a branch of the patrician &quot;gens Cornelia&quot;, but his family had fallen to an impoverished condition at the time of his birth. Publius Cornelius Rufinus, one of Sulla&#x27;s ancestors and also the last member of his family to be consul, was banished from the Senate after having been caught possessing more than 10 pounds of silver plate. Sulla&#x27;s family thereafter did not reach the highest offices of the state until Sulla himself. His father may have served as praetor, but details are unclear; his father married twice and Sulla&#x27;s stepmother was of considerable wealth, which certainly helped the young Sulla&#x27;s ambitions.

One story, &quot;as false as it is charming&quot;, relates that when Sulla was a baby, his nurse was carrying him around the streets, until a strange woman walked up to her and said, &quot;Puer tibi et reipublicae tuae felix&quot;, which can be translated as, &quot;The boy will be a source of luck to you and your state&quot;. After his father&#x27;s death, around the time Sulla reached adulthood, Sulla found himself impoverished. He might have been disinherited, though it was &quot;more likely&quot; that his father simply had nothing to bequeath. Lacking ready money, Sulla spent his youth among Rome’s comedians, actors, lute players, and dancers. During these times on the stage, after initially only singing, he started writing plays, Atellan farces, a kind of crude comedy. Plutarch mentions that during his last marriage to Valeria, he still kept company with &quot;actresses, musicians, and dancers, drinking with them on couches night and day&quot;.

Sulla almost certainly received a normal education for his class, grounded in ancient Greek and Latin classics. Sallust declares him well read, intelligent, and fluent in Greek. Regardless, by the standards of the Roman political class, Sulla was a very poor man. His first wife was called either Ilia or Julia. If the latter, he may have married into the Julii Caesares. He had one child from this union, before his first wife&#x27;s death. He married again, with a woman called Aelia, of whom nothing is known other than her name. During these marriages, he engaged in an affair with the hetaira Nicopolis, who also was older than he. The means by which Sulla attained the fortune which later would enable him to ascend the ladder of Roman politics are not clear; Plutarch refers to two inheritances, one from his stepmother (who loved him dearly) and the other from his mistress Nicopolis. accepts these inheritances without much comment and places them around Sulla&#x27;s turning thirty years of age.

==Early career==

After meeting the minimum age requirement of thirty, he stood for the quaestorship in 108 BC. Normally, candidates had to have first served for ten years in the military, but by Sulla&#x27;s time, this had been superseded by an age requirement. He was then assigned by lot to serve under the consul Gaius Marius.

=== Jugurthine War (107–106 BC) ===

The Jugurthine War had started in 112 BC when Jugurtha, grandson of Massinissa of Numidia, claimed the entire kingdom of Numidia in defiance of Roman decrees that divided it among several members of the royal family. After the massacre of a number of Italian traders who supported one of his rivals, indignation erupted as to Jugurtha&#x27;s use of bribery to secure a favourable peace treaty; called to Rome to testify on bribery charges, he plotted successfully the assassination of another royal claimant before returning home. After the war started, several Roman commanders were bribed (Bestia and Spurius); and one (Aulus Postumius Albinus) was defeated. In 109, Rome sent Quintus Caecilius Metellus to continue the war. Gaius Marius, a lieutenant of Metellus, returned to Rome to stand for the consulship in 107 BC. Marius was elected consul and, through assignment by tribunician legislation, took over the campaign. Sulla was assigned by lot to his staff.

When Marius took over the war, he entrusted Sulla to organise cavalry forces in Italy needed to pursue the mobile Numidians into the desert. If Sulla had married one of the Julii Caesares, this could explain Marius&#x27; willingness to entrust such an important task to a young man with no military experience, as Marius too had married into that family.

Under Marius, the Roman forces followed a plan very similar to that of Metellus, capturing and garrisoning fortified positions in the African countryside. Sulla was popular with the men; charming and benign, he built up a healthy rapport while also winning popularity with other officers, including Marius. Ultimately, the Numidians were defeated in 106 BC, due in large part to Sulla&#x27;s initiative in capturing the Numidian king. Jugurtha had fled to his father-in-law, King Bocchus I of Mauretania (a nearby kingdom); Marius invaded Mauretania, and after a pitched battle in which both Sulla and Marius played important roles in securing victory, Bocchus felt forced by Roman arms to betray Jugurtha. After the Senate approved negotiations with Bocchus, it delegated the talks to Marius, who appointed Sulla as envoy plenipotentiary. Winning Bocchus&#x27; friendship and making plain Rome&#x27;s demands for Jugurtha&#x27;s deliverance, Sulla successfully concluded negotiations and secured Bocchus&#x27; capture of Jugurtha and the king&#x27;s rendition to Marius&#x27; camp. The publicity attracted by this feat boosted Sulla&#x27;s political career. Years later, in 91 BC, Bocchus paid for the erection of a gilded equestrian statue depicting Sulla&#x27;s capture of Jugurtha.

=== Cimbrian War (104–101 BC) ===

In 104 BC, the Cimbri and the Teutones, two Germanic tribes who had bested the Roman legions on several occasions, seemed again to be heading for Italy. Marius, in the midst of this military crisis, sought and won repeated consulships, which upset aristocrats in the Senate; it is likely however that they acknowledged the indispensability of Marius&#x27; military capabilities in defeating the Germanic invaders. Amid a reorganisation of political alliances, the traditionalists in the Senate raised up Sulla – a patrician, even if a poor one – as a counterweight against the newcomer Marius.

Starting in 104 BC, Marius moved to reform the defeated Roman armies in southern Gaul. Sulla then served as legate under his former commander and, in that stead, successfully subdued a Gallic tribe which revolted in the aftermath of a previous Roman defeat. The next year, Sulla was elected military tribune and served under Marius, and assigned to treat with the Marsi, part of the Germanic invaders, he was able to negotiate their defection from the Cimbri and Teutones. His prospects for advancement under Marius being stalled, however, Sulla started to complain &quot;most unfairly&quot; that Marius was withholding opportunities from him. Demanding transfer to Catulus&#x27; (Marius&#x27; consular colleague) army, he received it.

In 102 BC, the invaders returned and moved to force the Alps. Catulus, with Sulla, moved to block their advance; the two men likely cooperated well. But Catulus&#x27; army was defeated in the eastern Alps and withdrew from Venetia and thence to the southern side of the river Po. At the same time, Marius had annihilated the Cimbri&#x27;s allies, the Teutones, at the Battle of Aquae Sextiae. Marius, elected again to the consulship of 101, came to Catulus&#x27; aid; Sulla, in charge of supporting army provisioning, did so competently and was able to feed both armies. The two armies then crossed the Po and attacked the Cimbri. After the failure of negotiations, the Romans and Cimbri engaged in the Battle of the Raudian Field in which the Cimbri were routed and destroyed.

Victorious, Marius and Catulus were both granted triumphs as the commanding generals. Refusing to stand for an aedileship (which, due to its involvement in hosting public games, was extremely expensive), Sulla became a candidate for the praetorship in 99 BC. He was, however, defeated. In memoirs related via Plutarch, he claimed this was because the people demanded that he first stand for the aedilate so – due to his friendship with Bocchus, a rich foreign monarch, – he might spend money on games. Whether this story of Sulla&#x27;s defeat is true is unclear. Regardless, Sulla stood for the praetorship again the next year and, promising he would pay for good shows, was elected praetor for 97 BC; he was assigned by lot to the urban praetorship.

=== Cilician governorship (96–93 BC) ===
His term as praetor was largely uneventful, excepting a public dispute with Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo (possibly his brother-in-law) and his magnificent holding of the &quot;ludi Apollinares&quot;. The next year, 96 BC, he was assigned – &quot;probably &quot;pro consule&quot; as was customary&quot; – to Cilicia in Asia Minor.

While governing Cilicia, Sulla received orders from the Senate to restore Ariobarzanes to the throne of Cappadocia. Ariobarzanes had been driven out by Mithridates VI of Pontus, who wanted to install one of his own sons (Ariarathes) on the Cappadocian throne. Despite initial difficulties, Sulla was successful with minimal resources and preparation; with few Roman troops, he hastily levied allied soldiers and advanced quickly into rugged terrain before routing superior enemy forces. His troops were sufficiently impressed by his leadership that they hailed him &quot;imperator&quot;.

Sulla&#x27;s campaign in Cappadocia had led him to the banks of the Euphrates, where he was approached by an embassy from the Parthian Empire. Sulla was the first Roman magistrate to meet a Parthian ambassador. At the meeting, he took the seat between the Parthian ambassador, Orobazus, and Ariobarzanes, seeking to gain psychological advantage over the Parthian envoy by portraying the Parthians and the Cappadocians as equals, with Rome being superior. While the Parthian ambassador, Orobazus, was executed upon his return to Parthia for allowing this humiliation, the Parthians ratified the treaty, establishing the Euphrates as a clear boundary between Parthia and Rome. At this meeting, Sulla was told by a Chaldean seer that he would die at the height of his fame and fortune. This prophecy was to have a powerful hold on Sulla throughout his lifetime.

In 94 BC, Sulla repulsed the forces of Tigranes the Great of Armenia from Cappadocia. He may have stayed in the east until 92 BC, when he returned to Rome; Keaveney places his departure in the year 93 BC. Sulla was regarded to have done well in the east: he had restored Ariobarzanes to the throne, been hailed &quot;imperator&quot; by his men, and was the first Roman to treat successfully with the Parthians. With military and diplomatic victory, his political fortunes seemed positive. However, his candidature was dealt a blow when he was brought up on charges of extorting Ariobarzanes. Even though the prosecutor declined to show up on the day of the trial, leading to Sulla&#x27;s victory by default, Sulla&#x27;s ambitions were frustrated.

=== Social War ===

Relations between Rome and its allies (the &quot;socii&quot;), had deteriorated over the years up to 91 BC. From 133 BC and the start of Tiberius Gracchus&#x27; land reforms, Italian communities were displaced from &quot;de jure&quot; Roman public lands over which no title had been enforced for generations. Various proposals to give the allies Roman citizenship over the decades had failed for various reasons, just as the allies also &quot;became progressively more aware of the need to cease to be subjects and to share in the exercise of imperial power&quot; by acquiring that citizenship. The Cimbric war also revived Italian solidarity, aided by Roman extension of corruption laws to allow allies to lodge extortion claims. When the pro-Italian plebeian tribune Marcus Livius Drusus was assassinated in 91 BC while trying again to pass a bill extending Roman citizenship, the Italians revolted.

The same year, Bocchus paid for the erection of a statue depicting Sulla&#x27;s capture of Jugurtha. This may have been related to Sulla&#x27;s campaign for the consulship. Regardless, if he had immediate plans for a consulship, they were forced into the background at the outbreak of war. At the start of the war, there were largely two theatres: a northern theatre from Picenum to the Fucine Lake and a southern theatre including Samnium. Sulla served as one of the legates in the southern theatre assigned to consul Lucius Julius Caesar.

In the first year of fighting, Roman strategy was largely one of containment, attempting to stop the revolting allies from spreading their rebellion into Roman-controlled territory. Sulla, in southern Italy, operated largely defensively on Lucius Julius Caesar&#x27;s flank while the consul conducted offensive campaigning. Late in the year, Sulla cooperated with Marius (who was a legate in the northern theatre) in the northern part of southern Italy to defeat the Marsi: Marius defeated the Marsi, sending them headlong into Sulla&#x27;s waiting forces. Sulla attempted also to assist Lucius&#x27; relief of the city of Aesernia, which was under siege, but both men were unsuccessful.

The next year, 89 BC, Sulla served as legate under the consul Lucius Porcius Cato. But after Cato&#x27;s death in battle with the Marsi, Sulla was prorogued &quot;pro consule&quot; and placed in supreme command of the southern theatre. He brought Pompeii under siege. After one of the other legates was killed by his men, Sulla refused to discipline them except by issuing a proclamation imploring them to show more courage against the enemy. While besieging Pompeii, an Italian relief force came under Lucius Cluentius, which Sulla defeated and forced into flight towards Nola. Killing Cluentius before the city&#x27;s walls, Sulla then invested the town and for his efforts was awarded a grass crown, the highest Roman military honour. Pompeii was taken some time during the year, along with Stabiae and Aeclanum; with the capture of Aeclanum, Sulla forced the Hirpini to surrender. He then attacked the Samnites and routed one of their armies near Aesernia before capturing the new Italian capital at Bovianum Undecimanorum. All of these victories would have been won before the consular elections in October 89.

Political developments in Rome also started to bring an end to the war. In 89 BC, one of the tribunes of the plebs passed the &quot;lex Plautia Papiria&quot;, which granted citizenship to all of the allies (with exception for the Samnites and Lucanians still under arms). This had been preceded by the &quot;lex Julia&quot;, passed by Lucius Julius Caesar in October 90 BC, which had granted citizenship to those allies who remained loyal. Buttressed by success against Rome&#x27;s traditional enemies, the Samnites, and general Roman victory across Italy, Sulla stood for and was elected easily to the consulship of 88 BC; his colleague would be Quintus Pompeius Rufus.

== First consulship, 88 BC ==

Sulla&#x27;s election to the consulship, successful likely due to his military success in 89 BC, was not uncontested. Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo, merely an ex-aedile and one of Sulla&#x27;s long-time enemies, had contested the top magistracy. Beyond personal enmity, Caesar Strabo may also have stood for office because it was evident that Rome&#x27;s relations with the Pontic king, Mithridates VI Eupator, were deteriorating and that the consuls of 88 would be assigned an extremely lucrative and glorious command against Pontus. Pompey Strabo may have coveted a second consulship for similar reasons. The question as to whom to send against Mithridates would be one of the sources of the following domestic crisis.

Shortly after Sulla&#x27;s election, probably in the last weeks of the year, Sulla married his daughter to one of his colleague Pompeius Rufus&#x27; sons. He also divorced his then-wife Cloelia and married Metella, widow of the recently-deceased Marcus Aemilius Scaurus. These marriages helped build political alliances with the influential Caecilii Metelli and the Pompeys. He was also assigned by the senate, probably with the support of his consular colleague, Quintus Pompeius Rufus, the Mithridatic command.

=== Sulpicius ===

Sulla became embroiled in a political fight against one of the plebeian tribunes, Publius Sulpicius Rufus, on the matter of how the new Italian citizens were to be distributed into the Roman tribes for purposes of voting. Sulla and Pompeius Rufus opposed the bill, which Sulpicius took as a betrayal; Sulpicius, without the support of the consuls, looked elsewhere for political allies. This led him to a secret deal with Marius, who had for years been coveting another military command, according to which Marius would support Sulpicius&#x27; Italian legislation in exchange for a law transferring Sulla&#x27;s command to Marius. Sulpicius&#x27; attempts to push through the Italian legislation again brought him into violent urban conflict, although he &quot;offered nothing to the urban plebs... so it continued to resist him&quot;. The consuls, fearful of intimidation of Sulpicius and his armed bodyguards, declared a suspension of public business (&quot;iustitium&quot;) which led to Sulpicius and his mob forcing the consuls to flee.

During the violence, Sulla was forced to shelter in Marius&#x27; nearby house (later denied in his memoirs). Marius arranged for Sulla to lift the &quot;iustitium&quot; and allow Sulpicius to bring proposals; Sulla, in a &quot;desperately weak position... [received] little in return[,] perhaps no more than a promise that Sulla&#x27;s life would be safe&quot;. Sulla then left for Capua before joining an army near Nola in southern Italy. He may have felt, after this political humiliation, that the only way to recover his career was to come back from the Mithridatic command victorious.

=== First march on Rome ===

With Sulpicius able to enact legislation without consular opposition, Sulla discovered that Marius had tricked him, for the first piece of legislation Sulpicius brought was a law transferring the command against Mithridates to Marius. Thus,

Speaking to the men, Sulla complained to them of the outrageous behaviour of Marius and Sulpicius. He hinted to them that Marius would find other men to fight Mithridates, forcing them to give up opportunities to plunder the East, claims which were &quot;surely false&quot;. The troops were willing to follow Sulla to Rome; his officers, however, realised Sulla&#x27;s plans and deserted him (except his quaestor and kinsman, almost certainly Lucius Licinius Lucullus). They then killed Marcus Gratidius, one of Marius&#x27; legates, when Gratidius attempted to effect the transfer of command.

When the march on Rome started, the Senate and people were appalled. The Senate immediately sent an embassy demanding an explanation for his seeming march on the fatherland, to which Sulla responded boldly, saying that he was freeing it from tyrants. Rome having no troops to defend itself, Sulla entered the city; once there, however, his men were pelted with stones from the rooftops by common people. Almost breaking before Marius&#x27; makeshift forces, Sulla then stationed troops all over the city before summoning the Senate and inducing it to outlaw Marius, Marius&#x27; son, Sulpicius, and nine others. He then reinforced this decision by legislation, retroactively justifying his illegal march on the city and stripping the twelve outlaws of their Roman citizenship. Of the twelve outlaws, only Sulpicius was killed after being betrayed by a slave. Marius and his son, along with some others, escaped to Africa.

=== Aftermath ===
Sulla then had Sulpicius&#x27; legislation invalidated on the grounds that all had been passed by force. According only to Appian, he then brought legislation to strengthen the Senate&#x27;s position in the state and weaken the plebeian tribunes by eliminating the &quot;comitia tributa&quot; as a legislative body and requiring that tribunes first receive senatorial approval for legislation; some scholars, however, reject Appian&#x27;s account as mere retrojection of legislation passed during Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship. He sent his army back to Capua and then conducted the elections for that year, which yielded a resounding rejection of him and his allies. His enemy, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, was elected consul for 87 BC in place of his candidate; his nephew was rejected as plebeian tribune while Marius&#x27; nephew was successful. Cinna, even before the election, said he would prosecute Sulla at the conclusion of the latter&#x27;s consular term.

After the elections, Sulla forced the consuls designate to swear to uphold his laws. And for his consular colleague, he attempted to transfer to him the command of Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo&#x27;s army. The law was vetoed by one of the tribunes, but when Quintus Pompeius Rufus went to Pompey Strabo&#x27;s army to take command under the Senate&#x27;s authority, he was promptly assassinated after his arrival and assumption of command, almost certainly on Strabo&#x27;s orders. No action was taken against the troops nor any action taken to relieve Pompey Strabo of command. He then left Italy with his troops without delay, ignoring legal summons and taking over command from a legate in Macedonia.

Sulla&#x27;s ability to use military force against his own countrymen was &quot;in many ways a continuation of the Social War... a civil war between former allies and friends developed into a civil war between citizens... what was eroded in the process was the fundamental distinction between Romans and foreign enemies&quot;. Political violence in Rome continued even in Sulla&#x27;s absence. Cinna violently quarrelled with his co-consul, Gnaeus Octavius. After Octavius induced the senate to outlaw Cinna, Cinna suborned the army besieging Nola and induced the Italians again to rise up. Marius, offering his services to Cinna, helped levy troops. By the end of 87 BC, Cinna and Marius had besieged Rome and taken the city, killed consul Gnaeus Octavius, massacred their political enemies, and declared Sulla an outlaw; they then had themselves elected consuls for 86 BC.

== Proconsular command and Civil War ==
=== First Mithridatic War ===

During the close of the Social War, in 89 BC, Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus invaded Roman Asia. In the summer of 88, he reorganised the administration of the area before unsuccessfully besieging Rhodes. News of these conquests reached Rome in the autumn of 89 BC, leading the Senate and people to declare war; actual preparations for war were, however, delayed: after Sulla was given the command, it took him some eighteen months to organise five legions before setting off; Rome was also severely strained financially. While Rome was preparing to move against Pontus, Mithridates arranged the massacre of some eighty thousand Roman and Italian expatriates and their families – known today as the Asiatic vespers – and confiscated their properties.

Mithridates&#x27; successes against the Romans incited a revolt by the Athenians against Roman rule. The Athenian politician Aristion had himself elected as &quot;strategos epi ton hoplon&quot; and established a tyranny over the city. dismisses claims in Plutarch and Vellius Paterclus of Athens&#x27; being forced to cooperate with Mithridates as &quot;very hollow&quot; and &quot;apologia&quot;. Rome defended Delos unsuccessfully from a joint invasion by Athens and Pontus. They were, however, successful in holding Macedonia, then governed by &quot;propraetor&quot; Gaius Sentius Saturninus and his legate Quintus Bruttius Sura.

==== Sack of Athens ====

Early in 87 BC, Sulla transited the Adriatic for Thessaly with his five legions. Upon his arrival, Sulla had his quaestor Lucullus order Sura, who had vitally delayed Mithridates&#x27; advances into Greece, to retreat back into Macedonia. He separately besieged Athens and Piraeus (the Long Walls had since been demolished). Threatened by the Pontic navy, Sulla sent his quaestor Lucullus to scrounge about for allied naval forces. At the same time, Mithridates attempted to force a land battle in northern Greece, and dispatched a large army across the Hellespont. These sieges lasted until spring of 86 BC.

Discovering a weak point in the walls and popular discontent with the Athenian tyrant Aristion, Sulla stormed and captured Athens (except the Acropolis) on 1 March 86 BC. The Acropolis was then besieged. Athens itself was spared total destruction &quot;in recognition of [its] glorious past&quot; but the city was sacked. In need of resources, Sulla sacked the temples of Epidaurus, Delphi, and Olympia; after a battle with the Pontic general Archelaus outside Piraeus, Sulla&#x27;s forces forced the Pontic garrison to withdraw by sea. Capturing the city, Sulla had it destroyed.

==== Boeotian battles ====
In the summer of 86 BC, two major battles were fought in Boeotia. The Battle of Chaeronea was fought in early summer around the same time the Athenian Acropolis was taken. The later battle of Orchomenus was fought in high summer but before the start of the autumn rains. The Pontic casualties given in Plutarch and Appian, the main sources for the battles, are exaggerated; Sulla&#x27;s report that he suffered merely fifteen losses is not credible.

Sulla decamped his army from Attica toward central Greece. Having exhausted available provisions near Athens, doing so was both necessary to ensure the survival of his army and also to relieve a brigade of six thousand men cut off in Thessaly. He declined battle with Pontus at the hill Philoboetus near Chaeronea before manoeuvring to capture higher ground and build earthworks. After some days, both sides engaged in battle. The Romans neutralised a Pontic charge of scythed chariots before pushing the Pontic phalanx back across the plain. According to the ancient sources, Archelaus commanded between 60,000 and 120,000 men; in the aftermath, he allegedly escaped with only 10,000.

After the Battle of Chaeronea, Sulla learnt that Cinna&#x27;s government had sent Lucius Valerius Flaccus to take over his command. Sulla had officially been declared an outlaw and in the eyes of the Cinnan regime, Flaccus was to take command of an army without a legal commander. Sulla moved to intercept Flaccus&#x27; army in Thessaly, but turned around when Pontic forces reoccupied Boetia. Turning south, he engaged the Pontic army – allegedly 90,000 – on the plain of Orchomenus. His troops prepared the ground by starting to dig a series of three trenches, which successfully contained Pontic cavalry. When the Pontic cavalry attacked to interrupt the earthworks, the Romans almost broke; Sulla on foot personally rallied his men and stabilised the area. Roman forces then surrounded the Pontic camp. Archelaus tried to break out but was unsuccessful; Sulla then annihilated the Pontic army and captured its camp. Archelaus then hid in the nearby marshes before escaping to Chalcis.

==== Peace with Mithridates ====

In the aftermath of the battle, Sulla was approached by Archelaus for terms. With Mithridates&#x27; armies in Europe almost entirely destroyed, Archelaus and Sulla negotiated a set of relatively cordial peace terms which were then forwarded to Mithridates. Mithridates was to give Asia and Paphlagonia back to Rome. He was to return the kingdoms of Bithynia and Cappadocia to Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes, respectively. Mithridates would also equip Sulla with seventy or eighty ships and pay a war indemnity of two or three thousand talents. Sulla would ratify Mithridates&#x27; position in Pontus and have him declared a Roman ally.

Mithridates, still in Asia, was faced with local uprisings against his rule. Adding to his challenges was Lucullus&#x27; fleet, reinforced by Rhodian allies. When Flaccus&#x27; consular army marched through Macedonia towards Thrace, his command was usurped by his legate Gaius Flavius Fimbria, who had Flaccus killed before chasing Mithridates with his army into Asia itself. Faced with Fimbria&#x27;s army in Asia, Lucullus&#x27; fleet off the coast, and internal unrest, Mithridates eventually met with Sulla at Dardanus in autumn 85 BC and accepted the terms negotiated by Archelaus.

After peace was reached, Sulla advanced on Fimbria&#x27;s forces, which deserted their upstart commander. Fimbria then committed suicide after a failed attempt on Sulla&#x27;s life. Sulla then settled affairs – &quot;reparations, rewards, administrative and financial arrangements for the future&quot; – in Asia, staying there until 84 BC. He then sailed for Italy at the head of 1,200 ships.

The peace reached with Mithridates was condemned in ancient times as a betrayal of Roman interests in favour of Sulla&#x27;s private interest in fighting and winning the coming civil war. Modern sources have been somewhat less damning, as the Mithridatic campaigns later showed that no quick victory over Pontus was possible as long as Mithridates survived. However, this and Sulla&#x27;s delay in Asia are &quot;not enough to absolve him of the charge of being more concerned with revenge on opponents in Italy than with Mithridates&quot;. The extra time spent in Asia, moreover, equipped him with forces and money later put to good use in Italy.

=== Civil war ===
Sulla crossed the Adriatic for Brundisium in spring of 83 BC with five legions of Mithridatic veterans, capturing Brundisium without a fight. Sulla&#x27;s arrival in Brundisium induced defections from the Senate in Rome: Marcus Licinius Crassus, who had already fled from the Cinnan regime, raised an army in Spain, and departed for Africa to join with Metellus Pius (who also joined the Sullans), joined Sulla even before his landing in Italy. Pompey, the son of Pompey Strabo, raised a legion from his clients in Picenum and also joined Sulla; Sulla treated him with great respect and addressed him as imperator before dispatching him to raise more troops. Even those whom Sulla had quarrelled with (including Publius Cornelius Cethegus, whom Sulla had outlawed in 88 BC) defected to join his side.

The general feeling in Italy, however, was decidedly anti-Sullan; many people feared Sulla&#x27;s wrath and still held memories of his extremely unpopular occupation of Rome during his consulship. The Senate moved the &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; against him and was successful in levying large amount of men and materiel from the Italians. Sulla, buoyed by his previous looting in Asia, was able to advance quickly and largely without the ransacking of the Italian countryside. Advancing on Capua, he met the two consuls of that year – Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus and Gaius Norbanus – who had dangerously divided their forces. He defeated Norbanus at the Battle of Mount Tifata, forcing the consul to withdraw. Continuing towards Scipio&#x27;s position at Teanum Sidicinum, Sulla negotiated and was almost able to convince Scipio to defect. Negotiations broke down after one of Scipio&#x27;s lieutenants seized a town held by Sulla in violation of a ceasefire. The breakdown allowed Sulla to play the aggrieved party and place blame on his enemies for any further bloodshed. Scipio&#x27;s army blamed him for the breakdown in negotiations and made it clear to the consul that they would not fight Sulla, who at this point appeared the peacemaker. Sulla, hearing this, feigned an attack while instructing his men to fraternise with Scipio&#x27;s army. Scipio&#x27;s men quickly abandoned him for Sulla; finding him almost alone in his camp, Sulla tried again to persuade Scipio to defect. When Scipio refused, Sulla let him go. Sulla attempted to open negotiations with Norbanus, who was at Capua, but Norbanus refused to treat and withdrew to Praeneste as Sulla advanced. While Sulla was moving in the south, Scipio fought Pompey in Picenum but was defeated when his troops again deserted.

For 82 BC, the consular elections returned Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, in his third consulship, with the younger Gaius Marius, the son of the seven-time consul, who was then twenty-six. The remainder of 83 BC was dedicated to recruiting for the next year&#x27;s campaign amid poor weather: Quintus Sertorius had raised a considerable force in Etruria, but was alienated from the consuls by the election of Gaius Marius&#x27; son rather than himself and so left to his praetorian province of Hispania Citerior; Sulla repudiated recognition of any treaties with the Samnites, whom he did not consider to be Roman citizens due to his rejection of Marius and Cinna&#x27;s deal in 87 BC.

Fighting in 82 BC began with reverses for Sulla&#x27;s opponents: their governors in Africa and Sardinia were deposed. When the campaign in Italy started, two theatres emerged, with Sulla facing the younger Marius in the south and Metellus Pius facing Carbo in the north. Marius, buttressed by Samnite support, fought a long and hard battle with Sulla at Sacriportus that resulted in defeat when five of his cohorts defected. After the battle, Marius withdrew to Praeneste and was there besieged.

After the younger Marius&#x27; defeat, Sulla had the Samnite war captives massacred, which triggered an uprising in his rear. He left one of his allies, Quintus Lucretius Afella to maintain the siege at Praeneste and moved for Rome. At the same time, the younger Marius sent word to assemble the Senate and purge it of suspected Sullan sympathisers: the urban praetor Lucius Junius Brutus Damasippus then had four prominent men killed at the ensuing meeting. The purge did little to strengthen resolve and when Sulla arrived at Rome, the city opened its gates and his opponents fled. Sulla had his enemies declared &quot;hostes&quot;, probably from outside the pomerium, and after assembling an assembly where he apologised for the war, left to fight Carbo in Etruria.

Carbo, who had suffered defeats by Metellus Pius and Pompey, attempted to redeploy so to relieve his co-consul Marius at Praeneste. Skilfully withdrawing to Clusium, he delegated to Norbanus command of troops to hold Metellus Pius. There, Sulla attacked him in an indecisive battle. Pompey ambushed eight legions sent to relieve Praeneste but an uprising from the Samnites and the Lucanians forced Sulla to deploy south as they moved also to relieve Praeneste or join with Carbo in the north. Sulla&#x27;s specific movements are very vaguely described in Appian, but he was successful in preventing the Italians from relieving Praeneste or joining with Carbo. In the north at the same time, Norbanus was defeated and fled for Rhodes, where he eventually committed suicide. After another attempt to relieve Praeneste failed, Carbo lost his nerve and attempted to retreat to Africa; his lieutenants attempted again to relieve Praeneste but after another failure, marched on Rome to force Sulla from his well-defended positions. Sulla hurried in full force towards Rome and there fought the Battle of the Colline Gate on the afternoon of 1 November 82 BC. Sulla was defeated and forced to flee into his camp but his lieutenant Crassus on the right wing was victorious. Sulla&#x27;s wing fled to the gates of Rome but were met with a closed gate, forcing them to stand and fight, eventually winning in the night. With Crassus pursuing the enemy as far into the countryside and victory at the Colline Gate, Sulla&#x27;s forces had won. The Samnite and anti-Sullan commanders were then hunted down as &quot;for all intents and purposes the civil war in Italy was over&quot;.

==Dictatorship and constitutional reforms==

After the battle at the Colline Gate, Sulla summoned the Senate to the temple of Bellona on the Campus Martius. There, while giving a speech, he had three or four thousand Samnite prisoners butchered, to the shock of the attending senators. Sulla marched to Praeneste and forced its siege to a close, with the younger Marius dead from suicide before its surrender.

Sulla had his stepdaughter Aemilia (daughter of &quot;princeps senatus&quot; Marcus Aemilius Scaurus) married to Pompey, although she shortly died in childbirth. Pompey was then dispatched to recover Sicily. With the capture and execution of Carbo, who had fled Sicily for Egypt, both consuls for 82 BC were now dead.

=== Proscription ===

In total control of the city and its affairs, Sulla instituted a proscription (a program of executing and confiscating the property of those whom he perceived as enemies of the state). Plutarch states in his &quot;Life of Sulla&quot; that &quot;Sulla now began to make blood flow, and he filled the city with deaths without number or limit,&quot; further alleging that many of the murdered victims had nothing to do with Sulla, though Sulla killed them to &quot;please his adherents.&quot;

The proscriptions are widely perceived as a response to that Marius and Cinna had implemented while they controlled the Republic during Sulla&#x27;s absence. Proscribing or outlawing every one of those whom he perceived to have acted against the best interests of the Republic while he was in the east, Sulla ordered some 1,500 nobles (i.e. senators and &quot;equites&quot;) executed, although as many as 9,000 people were estimated to have been killed. The purge went on for several months. Helping or sheltering a proscribed person was punishable by death, while killing a proscribed person was rewarded with two talents. Family members of the proscribed were not excluded from punishment, and slaves were not excluded from rewards. As a result, &quot;husbands were butchered in the arms of their wives, sons in the arms of their mothers.&quot; The majority of the proscribed had not been enemies of Sulla, but instead were killed for their property, which was confiscated and auctioned off. The proceeds from auctioned property more than made up for the cost of rewarding those who killed the proscribed, filling the treasury. Possibly to protect himself from future political retribution, Sulla had the sons and grandsons of the proscribed banned from running for political office, a restriction not removed for over 30 years.

The teenaged Gaius Julius Caesar, as Cinna&#x27;s son-in-law, became one of Sulla&#x27;s targets, and fled the city. He was saved through the efforts of his relatives, many of whom were Sulla&#x27;s supporters. that he regretted sparing the boy&#x27;s life in light of the grown man&#x27;s notorious ambition. Historian Suetonius records that when agreeing to spare Caesar, Sulla is supposed to have warned those who were pleading his case that he would become a danger to them in the future, saying, &quot;In this Caesar, there are many Mariuses.&quot; This however seems apocryphal.
=== Dictator ===
At the end of 82 BC or the beginning of 81 BC, the appointed Sulla &quot;dictator legibus faciendis et reipublicae constituendae causa&quot; (&quot;dictator for the making of laws and for the settling of the constitution&quot;). The assembly of the people subsequently ratified the decision, with no limit set on his time in office. Sulla had total control of the city and Republic of Rome, except for Hispania (which the prominent Marian general Quintus Sertorius had established as an independent state). This unusual appointment (used hitherto only in times of extreme danger to the city, such as during the Second Punic War, and then only for 6-month periods) represented an exception to Rome&#x27;s policy of not giving total power to an individual. Sulla can be seen as setting the precedent for Julius Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship and for the eventual end of the Republic under Augustus.

=== Reforms ===
Sulla sought to strengthen the senatorial aristocracy&#x27;s position in the state. Sulla retained his earlier reforms, which required senatorial approval before any bill could be submitted to the Plebeian Council (the principal popular assembly), and which had also restored the older, more aristocratic &quot;Servian&quot; organization to the Centuriate Assembly (assembly of soldiers). Sulla, himself a patrician, thus ineligible for election to plebeian tribunate, thoroughly disliked the office. As Sulla viewed the office, the tribunate was especially dangerous, and his intention was to not only deprive the tribunate of power, but also of prestige (Sulla himself had been officially deprived of his eastern command through the underhanded activities of a tribune). Over the previous 300 years, the tribunes had directly challenged the patrician class and attempted to deprive it of power in favour of the plebeian class. Through Sulla&#x27;s reforms to the plebeian council, tribunes lost the power to initiate legislation. Sulla then prohibited ex-tribunes from ever holding any other office, so ambitious individuals would no longer seek election to the tribunate, since such an election would end their political career. Finally, Sulla revoked the power of the tribunes to veto acts of the Senate, although he left intact the tribunes&#x27; power to protect individual Roman citizens.

Sulla then increased the number of magistrates elected in any given year and required that all newly elected &quot;quaestores&quot; gain automatic membership in the Senate. These two reforms were enacted primarily to allow Sulla to increase the size of the Senate from 300 to 600 senators. This also , since more than enough former magistrates were always available to fill the Senate. To further solidify the prestige and authority of the Senate, Sulla transferred the control of the courts from the&quot; equites&quot;, who had held control since the Gracchan reforms, to the senators. This, along with the increase in the number of courts, further added to the power that was already held by the senators. Sulla also codified, and thus established definitively, the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, which required an individual to reach a certain age and level of experience before running for office. Sulla wanted to reduce the risk that a general might attempt to seize power, as he had done. To this end, he reaffirmed the requirement that an individual must wait for ten years before being re-elected to an office. Sulla then established a system where all consuls and praetors served in Rome during their year in office and then commanded a provincial army as a governor for the year after they left office.

Finally, in a demonstration of his absolute power, Sulla expanded the pomerium, the sacred boundary of Rome, unchanged since the time of the kings. Sulla&#x27;s reforms both looked to the past (often repassing former laws) and regulated for the future, particularly in his redefinition of &quot;maiestas&quot; (treason) laws and in his reform of the Senate.

At the start of his second consulship in 80 BC with Metellus Pius, Sulla resigned his dictatorship. He also disbanded his legions and, through these gestures, attempted to show the re-establishment of normal consular government. He dismissed his&quot; lictores&quot; and walked unguarded in the Forum, offering to give account of his actions to any citizen. In a manner that the historian Suetonius thought arrogant, Julius Caesar later mocked Sulla for resigning the dictatorship.

==Retirement and death==
As promised, when his tasks were complete, Sulla returned his powers and withdrew to his country villa near Puteoli to be with his family. Plutarch states in his &quot;Life of Sulla&quot; that he retired to a life spent in dissolute luxuries, and he &quot;consorted with actresses, harpists, and theatrical people, drinking with them on couches all day long.&quot; From this distance, Sulla remained out of the day-to-day political activities in Rome, intervening only a few times when his policies were involved (e.g. the execution of Granius, shortly before his own death).

Sulla&#x27;s goal now was to write his memoirs, which he finished in 78 BC, just before his death. They are now largely lost, although fragments from them exist as quotations in later writers. Ancient accounts of Sulla&#x27;s death indicate that he died from liver failure or a ruptured gastric ulcer (symptomized by a sudden hemorrhage from his mouth, followed by a fever from which he never recovered), possibly caused by chronic alcohol abuse. Accounts were also written that he had an infestation of worms, caused by the ulcers, which led to his death.

His public funeral in Rome (in the Forum, in the presence of the whole city) was on a scale unmatched until that of Augustus in AD 14. Sulla&#x27;s body was brought into the city on a golden bier, escorted by his veteran soldiers, and funeral orations were delivered by several eminent senators, with the main oration possibly delivered by Lucius Marcius Philippus or Hortensius. Sulla&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes placed in his tomb in the Campus Martius. An epitaph, which Sulla composed himself, was inscribed onto the tomb, reading, &quot;No friend ever served me, and no enemy ever wronged me, whom I have not repaid in full.&quot; Plutarch claims he had seen Sulla&#x27;s personal motto carved on his tomb on the Campus Martius. The personal motto was &quot;no better friend, no worse enemy.&quot;

==Legacy==
Sulla is generally seen as having set the precedent for Caesar&#x27;s march on Rome and dictatorship. Cicero comments that Pompey once said, &quot;If Sulla could, why can&#x27;t I?&quot; Sulla&#x27;s example proved that it could be done, therefore inspiring others to attempt it; in this respect, he has been seen as another step in the Republic&#x27;s fall. Sulla attempted to mitigate this by passing laws to limit the actions of generals in their provinces, and although these laws remained in effect well into the imperial period, they did not prevent determined generals, such as Pompey and Julius Caesar, from using their armies for personal ambition against the Senate, a danger of which Sulla was intimately aware.

While Sulla&#x27;s laws such as those concerning qualification for admittance to the Senate, reform of the legal system and regulations of governorships remained on Rome&#x27;s statutes long into the principate, much of his legislation was repealed less than a decade after his death. The veto power of the tribunes and their legislating authority were soon reinstated, ironically during the consulships of Pompey and Crassus.

Sulla&#x27;s descendants continued to be prominent in Roman politics into the imperial period. His son, Faustus Cornelius Sulla, issued &quot;denarii&quot; bearing the name of the dictator, as did a grandson, Quintus Pompeius Rufus. His descendants among the Cornelii Sullae would hold four consulships during the imperial period: Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 5 BC, Faustus Cornelius Sulla in AD 31, Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix in AD 33, and Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix in 52 AD (he was the son of the consul of 31, and the husband of Claudia Antonia, daughter of the emperor Claudius). His execution in AD 62 on the orders of emperor Nero made him the last of the Cornelii Sullae.

It is recorded that Emperor Caracalla visited and renovated Sulla&#x27;s tomb and commissioned a statue of Sulla to be erected alongside one of Hannibal in Troy.

His rival, Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, described Sulla as having the cunning of a fox and the courage of a lion – but that it was his cunning that was by far the most dangerous. This mixture was later referred to by Machiavelli in his description of the ideal characteristics of a ruler.

==Cultural references==
* The dictator is the subject of four Italian operas, two of which take considerable liberties with history: &quot;Lucio Silla&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and &quot;Silla&quot; by George Frideric Handel. In each, he is portrayed as a bloody, womanising, ruthless tyrant who eventually repents his ways and steps down from the throne of Rome. Pasquale Anfossi and Johann Christian Bach also wrote operas on this subject.
* Sulla is a character in Taylor Caldwell&#x27;s novel &quot;A Pillar Of Iron&quot;; in it, he has Marcus Tullius Cicero&#x27;s injured brother, Quintus, recovering in his home, as Quintus is a soldier under his command. He is shown as cold, calculating and ruthless, yet a devoted leader to his men and sternly wedded to his personal ideals for Rome.
* Sulla is a central character in the first three &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; novels, by Colleen McCullough. Sulla is depicted as ruthless and amoral, very self-assured, and personally brave and charming, especially with women. His charm and ruthlessness make him a valuable aide to Gaius Marius. Sulla&#x27;s desire to move out of the shadow of aging Marius eventually leads to civil war. Sulla softened considerably after the birth of his son, and was devastated when the boy died at a young age. The novels depict Sulla full of regrets about having to put aside his homosexual relationship with a Greek actor to take up his public career.
* Sulla is played by Richard Harris in the 2002 miniseries &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.
* Lucius Cornelius Sulla is also a character in the first book of the &quot;Emperor&quot; novels by Conn Iggulden, which are centred around the lives of Gaius Julius Caesar and Marcus Junius Brutus.
* Sulla is a major character in &quot;Roman Blood&quot;, the first of the &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; mystery novels by Steven Saylor.
* Sulla is the subject of &quot;The Sword of Pleasure&quot;, a novel by Peter Green published in the UK in 1957. The novel is in the form of an autobiography.

==Marriages and children==
* His first wife was Ilia, according to Plutarch. If Plutarch&#x27;s text is to be amended to &quot;Julia&quot;, then she is likely to have been one of the Julias related to Julius Caesar, most likely Julia Caesaris, Caesar&#x27;s first cousin once removed. They had two children:
** The first was Cornelia, who first married Quintus Pompeius Rufus the Younger and later Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, giving birth to Pompeia (third wife of Julius Caesar) with the former.
** The second was Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who died young.
* His second wife was Aelia.
* His third wife was Cloelia, whom Sulla divorced due to sterility.
* His fourth wife was Caecilia Metella, with whom he also had three children:
** They had twins Faustus Cornelius Sulla, who was a &quot;quaestor&quot; in 54 BC, and Fausta Cornelia, who first married Gaius Memmius (&quot;praetor&quot; in 58 BC), then later Titus Annius Milo (&quot;praetor&quot; in 54 BC). Fausta&#x27;s son from her first marriage was Gaius Memmius, suffect consul in 34 BC.
** A son who died young, shortly before his mother&#x27;s own death.
* His fifth and last wife was Valeria, with whom he had only one child, a daughter: 
** Cornelia Postuma, who was born after Sulla&#x27;s death.

==Appearance and character==
Sulla was red-blond and blue-eyed, and had a dead-white face covered with red marks. Plutarch notes that Sulla considered that &quot;his golden head of hair gave him a singular appearance.&quot;

He was said to have a duality between being charming, easily approachable, and able to joke and cavort with the most simple of people, while also assuming a stern demeanor when he was leading armies and as dictator. An example of the extent of his charming side was that his soldiers would sing a ditty about Sulla&#x27;s one testicle, although without truth, which he allowed as being &quot;fond of a jest.&quot; This duality, or inconsistency, made him very unpredictable and &quot;at the slightest pretext, he might have a man crucified, but, on another occasion, would make light of the most appalling crimes; or he might happily forgive the most unpardonable offenses, and then punish trivial, insignificant misdemeanors with death and confiscation of property.&quot;

His excesses and penchant for debauchery could be attributed to the difficult circumstances of his youth, such as losing his father while he was still in his teens and retaining a doting stepmother, necessitating an independent streak from an early age. The circumstances of his relative poverty as a young man left him removed from his patrician brethren, enabling him to consort with revelers and experience the baser side of human nature. This &quot;firsthand&quot; understanding of human motivations and the ordinary Roman citizen may explain why he was able to succeed as a general despite lacking any significant military experience before his 30s.

The historian Sallust fleshes out this character sketch of Sulla:

<text>The femoral artery is a large artery in the thigh and the main arterial supply to the thigh and leg. The femoral artery gives off the deep femoral artery and descends along the anteromedial part of the thigh in the femoral triangle. It enters and passes through the adductor canal, and becomes the popliteal artery as it passes through the adductor hiatus in the adductor magnus near the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the thigh.

The femoral artery proximal to the origin of the deep femoral artery is referred to as the &quot;common femoral artery&quot;, whereas the femoral artery distal to this origin is referred to as the &quot;superficial femoral artery&quot;.

==Structure==
The femoral artery represents the continuation of the external iliac artery beyond the inguinal ligament underneath which the vessel passes to enter the thigh. The vessel passes under the inguinal ligament just medial of the midpoint of this ligament, midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis (mid-inguinal point).

In common usage, in clinical practice including angiology and vascular surgery, the femoral artery includes the common femoral artery, and the superficial femoral artery however, the Terminologia Anatomica (TA) only lists the femoral artery. (The TA is the international standard for human anatomical terminology developed by the Federative International Programme on Anatomical Terminology).
*The common femoral artery (CFA) is located between the inferior margin of the inguinal ligament, and the branching point of the deep femoral artery. Its first three or four centimetres are enclosed, with the femoral vein, in the femoral sheath. In 65% of people, the common femoral artery lies anterior to the femoral vein in the upper thigh. The CFA is, after the popliteal artery, the most common peripheral site of general dilatation or aneurysmal formation, at a frequency of 1/10 of the aorta. Highly calcific arterial stenosis in the CFA is very difficult to treat by endovascular intervention. Stent positioning in CFA may be limited by compressive or torsional forces, leading to stent fracture and/or restenosis. On the other hand, lithoplasty balloon angioplasty may represent a safe tool to treat CFA stenosis.
*The superficial femoral artery is a designation for the segment between the branching point of the deep femoral artery and the adductor hiatus, passing through the subsartorial canal. However, this term is not listed in &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;, and usage of the term &quot;superficial femoral&quot; is discouraged by many physicians because it leads to confusion among general medical practitioners, at least for the femoral vein that courses next to the femoral artery. In particular, the adjacent femoral vein is clinically a deep vein, where deep vein thrombosis indicates anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy, but the adjective &quot;superficial&quot; leads many physicians to falsely believe it is a superficial vein, which has resulted in patients with femoral thrombosis being denied proper treatment. Therefore, the segment is alternatively termed the subsartorial artery. The segment enters the adductor hiatus and becomes the popliteal artery which goes through the popliteal fossa.

===Relations===
The &quot;relations&quot; of the femoral artery are as follows:
* &quot;Anteriorly:&quot; In the upper part of its course, it is superficial and is covered by skin and fascia. In the lower part of its course, it passes behind the sartorius muscle.
* &quot;Posteriorly:&quot; The artery lies on the psoas, which separates it from the hip joint, the pectineus, and the adductor longus. The femoral vein intervenes between the artery and the adductor longus.
* &quot;Medially:&quot; It is related to the femoral vein in the upper part of its course.
* &quot;Laterally:&quot; The femoral nerve and its branches.

===Branches===
Common femoral artery
* The superficial circumflex iliac artery is a small branch that runs up to the region of the anterior superior iliac spine.
* The superficial epigastric artery is a small branch that crosses the inguinal ligament and runs to the region of the umbilicus.
* The superficial external pudendal artery is a small branch that runs medially to supply the skin of the scrotum or labium majus as.
* The deep external pudendal artery runs medially and supplies the skin of the scrotum or labium majus.
* The deep femoral artery is a large and important branch that arises from the lateral side of the femoral artery about 1.5 in. (4 cm) below the inguinal ligament. It passes medially behind the femoral vessels and enters the medial fascial compartment of the thigh. It ends by becoming the fourth perforating artery. At its origin, it gives off the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries, and during its course it gives off three perforating arteries.
Superficial femoral artery
* The descending genicular artery is a small branch that arises from the femoral artery near its termination within the adductor canal. It assists in supplying the knee joint.

==Clinical significance==
===Clinical examination===
The site for optimally palpating the &quot;femoral pulse&quot; is in the inner thigh, at the mid-inguinal point, halfway between the pubic symphysis and anterior superior iliac spine. Presence of a &quot;femoral pulse&quot; indicates a systolic blood pressure of more than 50 mmHg.

===Vascular access===
Femoral artery is the frequent site of access in angiography. As the pulsation of the common femoral artery can often be palpated through the skin; and the site of maximum pulsation is used as a point of puncture for catheter access. From here, wires and catheters can be directed anywhere in the arterial system for intervention or diagnostics, including the heart, brain, kidneys, arms and legs. The direction of the needle in the femoral artery can be against blood flow (retro-grade), for intervention and diagnostic towards the heart and opposite leg, or with the flow (ante-grade or ipsi-lateral) for diagnostics and intervention on the same leg. Access in either the left or right femoral artery is possible and depends on the type of intervention or diagnostic.

To image the lower limb vascular anatomy, the common femoral artery (CFA) is chosen as the site of entry. However, CFA entry can only be assessed by retrograde puncture. Therefore, a catheter is advanced retrogradely through the contralateral common femoral artery into common iliac artery, crossing the midline into ipsilateral CFA. The SFA can then be assessed by antegrade puncture.

The femoral artery can be used to draw arterial blood when the blood pressure is so low that the radial or brachial arteries cannot be located.

===Peripheral arterial disease===
The femoral artery is susceptible to peripheral arterial disease. When it is blocked through atherosclerosis, percutaneous intervention with access from the opposite femoral may be needed. Endarterectomy, a surgical cut down and removal of the plaque of the femoral artery is also common. If the femoral artery has to be ligated surgically to treat a popliteal aneurysm, blood can still reach the popliteal artery distal to the ligation via the genicular anastomosis. However, if flow in the femoral artery of a normal leg is suddenly disrupted, blood flow distally is rarely sufficient. The reason for this is the fact that the genicular anastomosis is only present in a minority of individuals and is always undeveloped when disease in the femoral artery is absent.

<text>The femoral triangle (or Scarpa&#x27;s triangle) is an anatomical region of the upper third of the thigh. It is a subfascial space which appears as a triangular depression below the inguinal ligament when the thigh is flexed, abducted and laterally rotated.

==Structure==
The femoral triangle is bounded:
* superiorly (also known as the base) by the inguinal ligament.
* medially by the medial border of the adductor longus muscle. (Some people consider the femoral triangle to be smaller hence the medial border being at the lateral border of the adductor longus muscle.)
* laterally by the medial border of the sartorius muscle.
The apex of the triangle is continuous with the adductor canal.
The roof is formed by the skin, superficial fascia, and deep fascia (fascia lata). The superficial fascia contains the superficial inguinal lymph nodes, femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve, branches of the ilioinguinal nerve, superficial branches of the femoral artery with accompanying veins, and upper part of the great saphenous vein. The deep fascia has a saphenous opening and the opening is covered by the cribiform fascia.

Its floor is formed by the pectineus and adductor longus muscles medially and iliacus and psoas major muscle laterally.

===Contents===

The femoral triangle is important as a number of vital structures pass through it, right under the skin. The following structures are contained within the femoral triangle (from lateral to medial):
* Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh - It crosses the lateral angle of the triangle, runs on the lateral side of the thigh and ends by dividing into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch supplies the anterolateral aspect of the thigh while the lateral branch supplies the lateral aspect of the gluteal region.
* Femoral nerve and its terminal branches - The nerve enters the femoral triangle by passing beneath the inguinal ligament, just lateral to the femoral artery. In the thigh, the nerve lies in a groove between iliacus muscle and psoas major muscles, outside the femoral sheath, and lateral to the femoral artery. After a short course of about 4 cm in the thigh, the nerve is divided into anterior and posterior divisions, separated by lateral femoral circumflex artery. 
* Nerve to pectineus - This nerve arises from the femoral nerve just above the inguinal ligament. It passes behind the femoral sheath to reach the anterior surface of the pectineus muscle.
Femoral sheath encloses the upper 4 cm of the femoral vessels. Its contents are shown below (from lateral to medial):
* Femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve - occupies the lateral compartment of the femoral sheath along with femoral artery. It supplies the skin over the femoral triangle.
* Femoral artery and its branches - It emerges from the base of the femoral triangle at the mid-inguinal point (midpoint between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis of the pelvic bone) and exits through the apex of the triangle into the adductor canal.
* Femoral vein and its tributaries - The vein lies medial to the femoral artery at the base of the triangle but as it approaches the apex of the triangle, it lies posteromedially to the femoral artery. It receives drainage from great saphenous vein, circumflex veins, and veins corresponding to the branches of the femoral artery here.
* Deep inguinal lymph nodes - It lies deep to the deep fascia, medial to the upper part of the femoral vein, inside the femoral canal (medial compartment of the femoral sheath). Cloquet&#x27;s node (also known as Rosenmuller&#x27;s node) also lies in this canal. It receives lymphatic drainage from superficial inguinal lymph nodes, lymphatic drainage from the glans penis or clitoris, and from the deep lymphatics of the lower limb.

==Clinical significance==
This area contains the superficial and deep lymphatic basins (groups) of the inguinal lymph nodes, and is the location targeted in an inguinal lymphadenectomy. The basins are separated by the fascia lata. For patients with palpable nodal disease, removal of the superficial and deep basins are recommended. In a patient with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy, generally only the superficial nodes are removed, unless Cloquet&#x27;s node (the most superior of the deep nodes) is clinically positive.

<text>London City Airport is an airport in London, England. It is located in the Royal Docks in the Borough of Newham, about east of the City of London and east of Canary Wharf. These are the two centres of London&#x27;s financial industry, which is a major user of the airport. The airport was developed by the engineering company Mowlem between 1986 and 1987. In 2016 it was bought by a Canadian-led consortium of AIMCo, OMERS, the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan and Wren House Infrastructure Management of the Kuwait Investment Authority.

London City Airport has a single runway, and a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P728) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers; this licence also allows training flights, but only for the purpose of training pilots to operate at this specific airport. Only multi-engine, fixed-wing aircraft up to Embraer E195-E2, Airbus A220 and A318 size with special aircrew and aircraft certification to fly 5.5° approaches, the strict noise limitations and further restrictions are allowed to conduct operations at London City Airport. the airport is about in size.

London City had over 5.1 million passenger movements in 2019. It is the fifth-busiest airport by passengers and aircraft movements serving the London area—after Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton—and was the 14th-busiest in the UK in 2017.

==History==

===Proposal and construction===
The airport was first proposed in 1981 by Reg Ward, who was Chief Executive of the newly formed London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) that was responsible for the regeneration of the area. He in turn discussed the proposal with chairman of John Mowlem &amp; Co Sir Philip Beck and the idea of an airport for Docklands was born. By November of that year Mowlem and Bill Bryce of Brymon Airways had submitted an outline proposal to the LDDC for a Docklands STOLport city centre gateway.
On 27 June 1982 Brymon&#x27;s Captain Harry Gee landed a de Havilland Canada Dash 7 turboprop aircraft on Heron Quays, in the nearby West India Docks, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the STOLport project. Later that year the LDDC published a feasibility study, an opinion poll amongst local residents showed a majority in favour of the development of the airport, and Mowlem submitted an application for planning permission.

A 63-day planning inquiry started on 6 June 1983. By the middle of the following year, Nicholas Ridley the Secretary of State for Transport had indicated that he was &quot;disposed to agree the application&quot;, but asked for further details. The Greater London Council brought an action in the High Court of Justice to reopen the inquiry. After the High Court dismissed the action in March 1985, outline planning permission was granted in May of that year, followed by the grant of detailed planning permission in early 1986. The airport site had an initial footprint of in area.

Construction began on the site shortly after permission was granted, with Charles, Prince of Wales laying the foundation stone of the terminal building, designed by R Seifert and Partners, on 2 May 1986. The first aircraft landed on 31 May 1987, with the first commercial services operating from 26 October 1987. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened London City Airport in November of the same year.

===Opening and runway extension===
In 1988, the first full year of operation, the airport handled 133,000 passengers. The earliest scheduled flights were operated to and from Plymouth, Paris, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. With a runway of only in length, and a slope of the glidepath of 7.5° (for noise abatement reasons), the airport could only be used by a very limited number of aircraft types, principally the Dash 7 and the smaller Dornier 228. In 1989, the airport submitted a planning application to extend the runway, allowing the use of a larger number of aircraft types.

In 1990, the airport handled 230,000 passengers, but the figures fell drastically after the Gulf War and did not recover until 1993, when 245,000 passengers were carried. By this time the extended runway had been approved and opened (on 5 March 1992). At the same time the glide path was reduced to 5.5°, still steep for a European airport (the slope of an airport glide path is normally 3.0°), but sufficient to allow a larger range of aircraft, including the BAe 146 regional jet liner and Airbus A318, to serve the airport.

By 1995, passenger numbers reached half a million, and Mowlem sold the airport to Irish businessman Dermot Desmond. Five years later passenger numbers had climbed to 1,580,000, and over 30,000 flights were operated. In 2002, a jet centre catering to corporate aviation was opened, as well as additional aircraft stands at the western end of the apron. In 2003, a new ground holding point was established at the eastern end of the runway, enabling aircraft awaiting takeoff to hold there whilst other aircraft landed.

===Further expansion===

On 2 December 2005, London City Airport DLR station opened on a branch of the Docklands Light Railway, providing rail access to the airport for the first time, and providing fast rail links to Canary Wharf and the City of London. By 2006, more than 2.3 million passengers used London City Airport.

In October 2006, the airport was purchased from Dermot Desmond by a consortium comprising insurer AIG Financial Products and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). In the final quarter of 2008 GIP increased its stake in the airport to 75%, the remaining 25% belonging to Highstar Capital.

London City Airport was granted planning permission to construct an extended apron with four additional aircraft parking stands and four new gates to the east of the terminal in 2001; they became operational on 30 May 2008. They are carried on piles above the water of the King George V Dock.

British Airways commenced the first scheduled transatlantic flights from the airport in September 2009, with a twice a day service to New York City&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport via Shannon using a specially configured Airbus A318 aircraft. The A318 is the smallest airliner to operate transatlantic since BA&#x27;s corporate predecessor, BOAC, began transatlantic jet flights on 4 October 1958, with the De Havilland Comet 4.

The first day of the service, one week after Willie Walsh of British Airways pledged to the United Nations that aviation would deliver deep cuts in carbon emissions, was disrupted by activists from Plane Stupid and Fight the Flights dressed up in business suits.

=== London Olympics 2012 ===

Before the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, it was reported that over £7 million (in 2011) was invested in the terminal to extend the Central Search area and adding other improvements. During the Games, however, the airport was only open for a few hours and there were strict restrictions (for security), and the low capacity ramp and short runway excluded most long-range arrivals. However, it was the closest airport to Olympic Park, with normal scheduled travel by road of 15 minutes.

=== Current expansion ===
In early 2013, work was expected to start on a £15 million investment programme to refurbish the western pier with new departure gates and improved lounges and to redevelop the international arrivals hall and baggage handling areas. In response to the UK government white paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot;, the airport operators have produced a master plan outlining their vision for growth up to 2030. The plan was subject to public consultation during spring 2006, and has been republished incorporating comments from this consultation. The master plan shows a phased expansion of the airport, giving the capability of handling 8 million passengers per annum by 2030. It does not propose the addition of a second runway, or significant expansion of the airport boundaries. Phase 1 of this development would be undertaken by 2015. It would include the in-progress construction of the eastern apron extension and provision of a finger pier to the south of this apron to provide passenger access to aircraft using the new parking stands. The terminal building would also be extended to use the triangle of land between it and the railway station. The existing jet centre serving corporate aviation would be extended, a new hangar built to allow aircraft maintenance, and a replacement fire station provided.

Phases 2 and 3 would be undertaken between 2015 and 2030. Further aircraft parking stands would be built to the east of the terminal, and a taxiway would be constructed alongside and to the south of the runway, to avoid the need for aircraft to back-track on the runway. Both these developments would involve further reduction in the water area of the King George V Dock. The existing fuel farm would be relocated to a site at the east of the airport, where it could be supplied by barge, and linked to a hydrant based supply system, thus eliminating both road tanker deliveries and on-airport fuel bowser movements. The existing surface car park would be replaced by a multi-storey car park, allowing extension of the vehicle drop-off and pick up area. The jet centre and hangar facilities would be further extended. Finally the existing terminal building would be replaced.

In line with phase 1 of the master plan, London City Airport made a planning application to the London Borough of Newham in August 2007. This would allow it to increase the number of flights per year from 80,000 to 120,000 by 2010. In July 2008, the Planning Officer for Newham Council produced a report on the Planning Application, recommending that planning permission be granted. The decision was deferred by the council&#x27;s Development Control Committee at their meeting on 30 July 2008, following a request from Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, that the decision be delayed until after a study by the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) has been published.

Over 10,000 local residents were consulted by Newham Council over the plan of which 1,109 replied, 801 with objections and 308 in support. The 801 objections mainly concerned increase in noise, increase in air pollution, surface transport, socio-economics and regeneration. The 308 supporters mainly concerned the reduction of air pollution, an alternative London and 2012 Olympic gateway, additional jobs, and benefiting to the local economy. The residents campaign group &quot;HACAN East&quot; (formerly &quot;Fight the Flights&quot;) is opposed to expansion due to noise and pollution issues.

On 29 September 2009, &quot;Fight the Flights&quot; took Newham Council to court in order to challenge their decision to allow a 50% increase from 76,000 to 120,000 flights. On 20 January 2010, the challenge was dismissed, and a deadline of 14 days to appeal was set. The plan was given the go-ahead in February 2015. However this was overturned by Boris Johnson in March 2015. On 27 July 2016 London City Airport was given approval by authorities for their £344 million expansion plan.

=== Recent developments ===
In October 2015, Global Infrastructure Partners which owned 75% of the facility, put it up for sale, with the agreement of Oaktree Capital Management which holds the remaining 25%. A sale to a Canadian-led consortium of Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), OMERS, the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan and Wren House Infrastructure Management of the Kuwait Investment Authority for £2 billion was confirmed in February 2016. The sale was completed on 10 March 2016.

In September 2016, British Airways announced the termination of one of its two daily long-haul all-business class services from the airport to New York City, citing economic reasons.

Green Party candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election and member of the London Assembly Siân Berry has been vocal in calling for the closure of London City Airport and subsequent redevelopment of the area it occupies. Caroline Russell, the leader of the Green Party on the London Assembly and Scott Ainslie, former Green MEP for London and councillor on Lambeth Council have both called for its closure.

In March 2020, British Airways suspended its daily service to New York due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, the airline confirmed the service would not return.

In November 2020 the new parallel taxiway and eight additional aircraft parking stands were declared operational, these were delivered as part of the first phase of the City Airport Development Programme (CADP). Both the new stands and the parallel taxiway were constructed on a concrete deck mounted on piles driven in to the bed of the King George V Dock.

In January 2021, after a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport became the first major airport controlled by a remote air traffic control tower. The airport had previously decided to relocate the control tower to a site away at Swanwick, Hampshire, utilising three cable links providing live video to air traffic controllers.

In April 2023, London City became the first major UK airport to drop its 100-millilitre liquid rule. Passengers travelling through London City are now able to carry liquids of up to 2 litres in their carry-on luggage for the first time since the liquid rule was implemented in the UK in 2006.

In July 2023 the revised operating distances for the runway became operational following the introduction of Engineered Material Arresting Systems (EMAS) in the Runway Safety Areas at each end of the runway.

Plans were approved to increase the passenger cap at London City Airport from 6.5 million to 9 million passengers with the number of morning flights increasing between 06:00 to 09:00.

==Operations==

===Served destinations===
Owing to London City Airport&#x27;s proximity to London&#x27;s Docklands and financial district, the airport&#x27;s primary users are business travellers with destinations such as Luxembourg and Frankfurt, although the number of leisure destinations served like Palma de Mallorca, Málaga or Chambéry has increased in recent years. London City is at its busiest during the winter months, when a number of airlines, most notably British Airways and Swiss International Air Lines, fly to ski resort gateway destinations. Zürich, Geneva, and Milan are among the destinations popular among winter sports enthusiasts.

In July 2020, British Airways announced the termination of its all-business-class flights between City and New York-JFK, which had been operated since 2009.

===Facilities and utilised aircraft===
Due to the airport&#x27;s proximity to Central London, it has stringent rules imposed to limit the noise impact from aircraft operations. This, together with the physical dimensions of the runway and the steep glideslope, limits the aircraft types that can use London City Airport. The size and layout of the airport and overall complexity caused by the lack of taxiways mean that the airport gets very busy during peak hours. The air traffic controllers have to deal with over 38 flights per hour on a runway which, prior to the opening of the full length taxiway at the end of 2020, required a lengthy backtrack for each aircraft needing to depart from runway 27 or land on runway 09. Operations are restricted to 06:30 to 22:30 Monday to Friday, 06:30 to 13:00 on Saturdays and 12:30 to 22:30 on Sundays. These restrictions are related to noise. On 19 December 2022, the airport applied for the restriction on Saturday afternoon to be removed. This application was rejected by Newham Council on 10 July 2023, citing &quot;continued concerns over the noise and environmental impact of the airport on those living nearby.&quot;

Mid-range airliners seen at London City include the ATR 42 (both −300 and −500 variants), ATR 72, Airbus A318, Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, BAe 146/Avro RJ, Dornier 328, Embraer ERJ 135, Embraer 170, Embraer 190 and Fokker 50. On 30 January 2009, trials were completed successfully with the ATR 72–500, leading to its approval for use at the airport. The Embraer 190SR underwent trials from 28 March 2009, and thereafter gained approval. The Fokker 70, BAe Jetstream 41, Saab 340 and Saab 2000 also have approval for scheduled operations at the airport. A number of airlines including Swiss and Odyssey have ordered the Airbus A220 with the intention of operating it from London City once delivered and approved. A220-100 operations for Swiss from City commenced in late 2017.

On 22–23 March 2017, the A220-100 completed tests for the 5.5-degree approach in Wichita and Salina, Kansas. The A220-100 was certified for the steep approach landing for London City in April 2017. In 2023, Airbus confirmed working on certifying the larger A220-300 for operation at the airport. Corporate aircraft such as the Beechcraft Super King Air, Cessna CitationJet series, Hawker 400, Hawker 800, Piaggio Avanti and variants of the Dassault Falcon business jets are increasingly common. The airport is not available for use by single-engine aircraft or helicopters; recreational flights and single-pilot operations are also not permitted. In 2025, the airport authority applied for approval of the significantly larger Airbus A320neo to be operated into the airport.

The size of the airport, constrained by the water-filled Royal Albert and King George V docks to the north and south respectively, also means that there are no covered maintenance facilities for aircraft. In the late 2000s, AirSea Lines envisaged using the airport as a seaplane base.

==Terminal==
With space limited in East London, and comparatively low passenger volumes, London City Airport is small compared with several other airports serving London, such as Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Southend and Luton. The airport has a single, two-storey passenger terminal building with 18 gates, all hardstands. The ground floor contains the check-in desks and some service facilities as well as a staircase leading to the security control on the upper level, after which the airside waiting area and several more shops can be found. The waiting area is connected to piers on both sides where corridors on the upper floor lead to the departure gates on the ground level. As the airport has no jet bridges, walk-boarding is used on all stands.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular services to and from London City Airport:


==Statistics==
===Passengers===
Passenger numbers at London City Airport saw rapid growth between 2003 and 2008, doubling from around 1.5 million per year to over 3 million. Totals declined in 2009 and 2010, but have since recovered and in 2019 over 5.1 million passengers passed through London City. In 2020, passenger numbers sharply dropped to below 1 million annually during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Routes===

==Ground transport==
===Docklands Light Railway===

London City Airport is served by London City Airport DLR station, which is an elevated station adjoining the terminal building. The station is on a branch of the Docklands Light Railway, which links the airport to Canary Wharf and the City of London as well as to and stations with interchanges to London Underground, London Overground, Elizabeth line, Greater Anglia, c2c, Thameslink and Southeastern High Speed train services.

===Elizabeth line===

Until 2006, Silvertown railway station on the North London line served the airport, but it was closed during the construction of Crossrail. The Elizabeth line, which opened in May 2022, passes around 300 m to the south of the airport, but does not stop there. Proposals were put forward that a new station should be opened on the Elizabeth line to serve the airport, but a London City Airport station was not included in TfL&#x27;s Crossrail plans.

===Road access===
The airport is served by the A1020 road and the A112 road. These give fast links to Canning Town, the City of London and Stratford, as well as connecting to the A13 and the North Circular Road, London (A406). Also the A13 provides easy access to the M25 motorway, as with the A406 connecting to the M11 motorway.
The airport has both a short-term and a long-term car park, both within walking distance of the terminal and a taxi rank outside the terminal door.

===Local buses===
The airport is served by London Buses services:
*473 to Stratford via Plaistow and North Woolwich
*474 to Canning Town and Manor Park via Beckton and East Ham

The express shuttle buses, which formerly ran to various destinations, were withdrawn after the DLR line was built.

===River bus===
Thames Clippers services call at a pier at the nearby residential development Royal Wharf, allowing travel into Central London using an Oyster card or contactless smart card.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 13 February 2009, BA CityFlyer Flight 8456 (an Avro RJ100, registered G-BXAR, flying from Amsterdam) suffered a nose-gear collapse while landing at London City. None of the 67 passengers or five crew members were seriously injured in the incident, but three passengers suffered minor injuries; two of them were kept in hospital overnight. The aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair, and was written off by insurers in May 2009.
*On 21 October 2016, 27 people were injured, two of them seriously, when a tear gas substance was released in London City Airport. Hundreds of other passengers reported experiencing temporary blindness and itching. Many flights were cancelled, leaving thousands stranded and causing major disruption around Europe. A few days later, police arrested a suspect under &quot;terror offences&quot; and the media referred to the incident as a terror attack. Police later confirmed that tear gas bottles had deliberately been placed to &quot;cause harm or disruption&quot;. Security was increased at the airport in the days following the attack.

<text>The deep femoral artery also known as the deep artery of the thigh, or profunda femoris artery, is a large branch of the femoral artery. It travels more deeply (&quot;profoundly&quot;) than the rest of the femoral artery. It gives rise to the lateral circumflex femoral artery and medial circumflex femoral artery, and the perforating arteries, terminating within the thigh.

==Structure==

=== Origin ===
The deep femoral artery branches off the posterolateral side of the femoral artery soon after its origin.

=== Course ===
It travels down the thigh closer to the femur than the femoral artery. It runs between the pectineus muscle and the adductor longus muscle. It runs on the posterior side of adductor longus muscle. It pierces the adductor magnus muscle, and may be known as the fourth perforating artery as it continues. The deep femoral artery does not leave the thigh; terminating as perforating tissue branches within the thigh.

===Branches===
The deep femoral artery gives off the following branches:
* Lateral circumflex femoral artery.
* Medial circumflex femoral artery.
* 3 perforating arteries that perforate the adductor magnus muscle to the posterior and medial compartments of the thigh to connect with the branches of the popliteal artery behind the knee. The perforating arteries arise in the anterior compartment of thigh. The terminal continuation of the deep femoral artery may be regarded as the fourth perforating artery.

=== Distribution ===
The deep femoral artery is the main supply of oxygenated blood to the thigh.

The medial circumflex femoral artery is distributes to the adductor group (adductor longus, magnus, and brevis), gracilis, and pectineus. It also supplies the femoral head and neck.

The lateral circumflex femoral artery supplies muscles of the knee extensor group (vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris).

The perforating arteries supply the hamstring muscles (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris).

<text>Patrick Kenny (born 29 January 1948) is an Irish broadcaster, who currently hosts the daily radio show &quot;The Pat Kenny Show&quot; on Newstalk and the current affairs show &quot;Pat Kenny Tonight&quot; on Virgin Media One.

Prior to this, Kenny had a 41-year high-profile career at RTÉ, in which he was their highest paid presenter for several years. He presented radio show &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot; on RTÉ Radio 1 each weekday morning between 10:00 and midday until 2013. He hosted &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; from September 1999 until May 2009, then returned as a stand-in host in January 2013.
He presented the current affairs programme &quot;The Frontline&quot;, each Monday night from 2009 until its axing in 2013.

He was the co-host of Eurovision Song Contest 1988, as well as numerous other television shows, including &quot;Today Tonight&quot;, &quot;Saturday Live&quot; and &quot;Kenny Live&quot;, and has worked for both RTÉ Radio 1 and RTÉ 2fm, sometimes simultaneously, in a career that has spanned five decades. He is the holder of a Jacob&#x27;s Award and was perennially cited as the highest paid employee at RTÉ. He was named 23rd most influential person of 2009 by the magazine &quot;Village&quot;.

==Early career==
Kenny was educated at the O&#x27;Connell School and obtained a chemical engineering degree from University College Dublin (UCD) in 1969. Subsequently, he was a postgraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology and then a lecturer at Bolton Street College of Technology in Dublin. He began his broadcasting career in parallel to his academic &quot;day-job&quot; by working as a continuity announcer on RTÉ radio in the mid-1970s. He subsequently became a radio disc jockey.

In 1986, Kenny won a Jacob&#x27;s Award for his &quot;unusual versatility&quot; in presenting three diverse radio shows: &quot;Saturday View&quot; on RTÉ Radio 1, and, on RTÉ 2fm, &quot;The Kenny Report&quot; and &quot;The Outside Track&quot;.

==Television career==

===&quot;Today Tonight&quot;, Eurovision, &quot;The Pat Kenny Show&quot;, &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, &quot;Kenny Live!&quot;===
Kenny became a television broadcaster on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Today Tonight&quot;, a current affairs programme in the mid-1980s. He moved in an unexpected direction for a current affairs presenter when he filled the role of co-presenter of the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest. This he did alongside Michelle Rocca at the Royal Dublin Society&#x27;s Simmonscourt Pavilion. Kenny continued to be associated with Eurovision, providing television commentary for Irish viewers of the event on nine occasions from 1991 to 1999. He was criticised for referring on-air to the transsexual Israeli singer Dana International as &quot;he, she or it&quot; during the 1998 edition of the contest and later refused to apologise for the remark.

He presented &quot;The Pat Kenny Show&quot;. Subsequently, he had a guest slot on the weekly chat show &quot;Saturday Live&quot;. He went on to host the show permanently and its title was changed to &quot;Kenny Live!&quot;. There was a much publicised rivalry between &quot;Kenny Live!&quot;, broadcast on Saturday nights and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, broadcast on Friday nights. &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, latterly &quot;Kenny Live!&quot;, had been conceived as preserving the weekend slot on a Saturday night to prevent loss of viewers and corresponding loss of advertising revenue.

===&quot;The Late Late Show&quot; (1999–2009)===

Gay Byrne retired from presenting &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in 1999. Kenny was announced as Byrne&#x27;s replacement on 24 May 1999. He was in Israel for the 1999 Eurovision Song Contest when the announcement was made that he was taking over at the age of 51. Kenny became the new host, but not without criticism of his style during his tenure; &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; columnist Eilis O&#x27;Hanlon expressed this sentiment in 2006, writing:

Among the highlights of Kenny&#x27;s career in presenting &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was his &quot;Toy Show&quot; interview with comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld remained tight-lipped, even as Pat Kenny referred to him as Jerry Sein-field. Kenny also came under fire after an interview on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; with Babyshambles&#x27; lead singer Pete Doherty. Kenny repeatedly questioned Doherty over his much talked about drug habits, with Doherty appearing visibly uncomfortable. Doherty, obviously annoyed, stated that Kenny had asked him &quot;about 12&quot; questions about drugs and Kate Moss, but nothing about his music; &quot;I don&#x27;t know if you could even name a song that I&#x27;ve written&quot;, Doherty quipped at one point. &quot;Possibly not&quot;, Kenny replied.

On 27 March 2009, Kenny announced that he would resign as host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; at the end of the season. Guests on his final night included U2, who presented Kenny with a rare Gibson guitar and a pair of shades. During the final programme, which included an outside party, Kenny thanked the crew for their work during his ten-year reign as host.

===&quot;The Frontline&quot; and &quot;Prime Time&quot; (2009–2013)===

In September 2009, Kenny began presenting &quot;The Frontline&quot; every Monday night on RTÉ One, a topical debate show revolving around the interaction between Kenny, his guests and an invited audience. On 19 July 2012, Kenny appeared as host of &quot;Prime Time&quot;, the current affairs programme which replaced Kenny&#x27;s pre-&quot;Late Late Show&quot; programme, &quot;Today Tonight&quot;. The &quot;Evening Herald&quot; called this &quot; a surprise return to a familiar slot... It was a return to his roots for Mr Kenny who made his name as a current affairs broadcaster&quot;. &quot;The Frontline&quot; ended in January 2013 as Kenny became the co-host with long-time main presenter Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan of a revamped &quot;Prime Time&quot; in February 2013 until he departed RTÉ on 31 July 2013.

===On-air attacks and interruptions===
Kenny has sustained several on-air personal attacks during his career as presenter of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and &quot;The Frontline&quot;. These include:
* In November 2006, Paul Stokes, an intruder on the set of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, confronted Kenny live on air calling the show host and his predecessor Gay Byrne &quot;insufferable arseholes&quot;. Eight days later Stokes rammed his car into the entrance of RTÉ&#x27;s television centre and was subsequently charged with harassment after daubing walls near Kenny&#x27;s home with threatening messages.
* During an interview with SIPTU general president Jack O&#x27;Connor on &quot;The Frontline&quot; on 2 November 2009, O&#x27;Connor suggested that a &quot;reasonable level of tax&quot; should be levied on &quot;trophy houses&quot;. When asked to define the term &quot;trophy house&quot;, O&#x27;Connor replied: &quot;A house like yours, probably&quot;, to which Kenny replied, &quot;I built my house in 1988. How is it a &#x27;trophy house&#x27;? I don&#x27;t want this crap coming at me!&quot; O&#x27;Connor apologised a few moments later.
* During an interview with Minister for Social and Family Affairs Mary Hanafin on &quot;The Frontline&quot; on 9 November 2009, an audience member berated Kenny over the issue of an excessive wage. He compared Kenny&#x27;s wage to that of the President of the United States for 11 hours of broadcast per working week. He alleged that Kenny had no right to pontificate about social welfare, or people who had no means. When Kenny attempted to resume, he was repeatedly interrupted by the audience member who continued to shout. The attack lasted for several minutes before a commercial break was taken.

===Departure from RTÉ===

On 31 July 2013, it was announced that Kenny would not be renewing his contract with RTÉ after a 41-year presence there, and would be leaving RTÉ to join radio station &quot;Newstalk&quot; to host a current affairs magazine show on weekdays from 10am to 12.30pm, starting on 2 September 2013. It caused some surprise in RTÉ. RTÉ presenters said the defection of Pat Kenny to rivals Newstalk was a &quot;major loss&quot; for the national broadcaster. Gay Byrne described his decision as a great loss for RTÉ; Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan said she has learnt greatly from Kenny; saying that he &quot;... is an incredibly talented broadcaster and has shown all of us current affairs presenters how it is done.&quot;

===Return to television===
It was announced in August 2014 that Kenny would return to TV screens in 2015 on UTV Ireland with a new show titled &quot;Pat Kenny in the Round&quot;, recorded in the Round Room in the Mansion House in Dublin. However the show was axed in September 2015.

In 2016, Kenny joined TV3 to host the current affairs show &quot;Pat Kenny Tonight&quot; along with Colette Fitzpatrick. Later the series was hosted just by Pat Kenny. A new series Pat Kenny&#x27;s Big Debate was launched and in 2021 it was announced that Pat Kenny was no longer working with Virgin Media TV.

==Politics and Activism==
Kenny supported Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan when she came under fire from Sinn Féin for challenging Martin McGuinness of his past misdeeds during the 2011 presidential election campaign in a &quot;Prime Time&quot; debate, saying &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t criticise Miriam for doing what she did&quot;. Kenny was also critical of Seán Gallagher after the presidential candidate objected to a tweet Kenny read out on &quot;The Frontline&quot; days before the 2011 election. Kenny told Gallagher to get over Tweetgate and get back to what he was &quot;supposed to be good at&quot;—creating jobs, and said he was &quot;judged by the public not to be worthy.&quot;

In 2018, Kenny lent his support to a Health Service Executive campaign to educate the public on harm reduction concerning cocaine. While using his radio slot to read out practical advice regarding drug use, Kenny also warned listeners that cocaine &quot;lines the pockets of criminals&quot;, despite a perception of the drug as &quot;party central&quot;.

Kenny has spoken out against Ireland&#x27;s historic censoring of Provisional IRA figures in broadcast media, describing the practice as &quot;unsuccessful&quot;. He cites both American politician John F. Kennedy and actor Paul Newman as personal heroes. As a child, Kenny witnessed Kennedy in the flesh during the President&#x27;s 1963 state visit to Ireland, later describing Kennedy as &quot;the epitome of power and charisma&quot; who &quot;was iconic even before he was killed.&quot;

He has been a vocal critic of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&#x27;s efforts to promote gender equality at the top of European politics. Speaking in August 2020, Kenny commented: &quot;I know she [President von der Leyen] wants gender balance in the Commission, but it should be: Can you nominate two talented people, and I don&#x27;t care what gender they are, as long as they can do the job. The idea that you get two people of one gender who are really fabulous, and it would be a toss-up between them, but you have to discard one of them and pick someone of the other gender in order to be politically correct, it doesn&#x27;t seem right to me.&quot;

==Earnings==
Kenny was the highest-paid presenter on RTÉ in 2008 earning €950,956. His pay was reduced to €729,604 in 2009 due to the economic climate. Director General of RTÉ Cathal Goan, commenting on the salaries paid to the top stars, said: &quot;There&#x27;s no question that by today&#x27;s standard, they were excessive. I have to repeat that they were set at a different time in a different competitive reality where some of this talent might be up for poaching by other organisations and in RTÉ’s view at the time, they delivered value for money&quot;. Kenny issued the following statement: &quot;I am satisfied that the significant reduction in the fees paid to my company takes account of current economic circumstances while also reflecting my experience over 37 years in broadcasting at RTÉ&quot;. His high salary was strongly denounced on live television, while Kenny was hosting. He was not technically a member of RTÉ staff but was paid through a separate company, enabling Kenny and RTÉ to reduce the amount of tax paid on his salary.

Kenny has defended himself by saying he was working harder than ever, that &quot;I&#x27;ve done my bit&quot; and that he would never &quot;put a gun to RTE&#x27;s head&quot;.

In March 2013, it was revealed he had earned €630,000 in 2011. Pat Kenny Media Services Limited, the private company of which Kenny and his wife are sole directors, posted accumulated profits of €1.52 million in 2018.

==Awards==
In September 2012, Kenny was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by University College Dublin for &quot;exceptional contributions to public service broadcasting.&quot; In 2016, he received a lifetime achievement award by the Irish Film and Television Awards (IFTA).

==Styles of Byrne and Kenny==
Kenny&#x27;s career has been extensive, having been a continuity announcer, radio disc jockey, television current affairs presenter, subsequently anchor and chat show host. His early radio career mirrored that of Byrne&#x27;s. However Byrne focused always being in entertainment and never in current affairs. Byrne described himself as an entertainer first.

Initially Kenny was perceived, by a critic, as being unsuited to the field of light entertainment as this description of &quot;Kenny Live!&quot; stated:
&quot;The fact is that Pat Kenny, is unsuited to the type of showbiz knockabout which Gay Byrne is so at home with.&quot;:

Kenny has described his style:
&quot;Do you want bland television where everything you hear reinforces your own view, or do you want to be challenged? I favour the latter. I like to challenge people. You might get angry and pick up the phone to Joe Duffy, or you might complain to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission; that&#x27;s great. It means you&#x27;re involved in the argument in some way&quot;.

Due to his long association with the show, Byrne in his autobiography seemed to almost have proprietarial rights, having been both producer and presenter of the show. Kenny was the subject of much media criticism for his takeover from Byrne.
In autumn 2003, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; had a competitor in the Friday evening time slot, with the arrival of competing television chat programme, &quot;The Dunphy Show&quot;, hosted by controversial broadcaster Eamon Dunphy on RTÉ&#x27;s main rival TV3. However, &quot;The Dunphy Show&quot; failed to achieve expected viewership figures and was scrapped in December 2003 after 14 episodes.

In October 2011, Gay Byrne said the idea that he and Pat were competing in some sort of rivalry was &quot;bloody rubbish&quot;. John Bowman&#x27;s history of RTÉ Television contains a quote from chief executive Vincent Finn from when Kenny asked for to be paid more money. &quot;In many ways,&quot; Mr Finn told the RTÉ Authority, &quot;he believes he is better than Gay Byrne.&quot; Bowman stood by this in a radio interview on Kenny&#x27;s show, saying that the revelations in which Finn said Kenny &quot;feels very strong about the Gay Byrne thing&quot; were contained in the RTÉ Authority archives.

==Personal life==
Kenny is married to Kathy. She has publicly defended him against the criticism he received over the amount of money he was paid by RTÉ. They live in Dalkey, Dublin, in a house built in the early 1990s on a site purchased in 1988. They have two daughters and Kenny is also the father of another child from a previous relationship, whom he sees regularly and supports financially. Kenny&#x27;s family home was on Infirmary Road, Dublin. Kenny&#x27;s father, Jim, died in 1982, aged 74. After Kenny&#x27;s mother Connie died in 2008, her burial received media coverage as it led to Kenny&#x27;s non-appearance on an edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; that was aired that same evening.

===Off-screen personality===
An RTÉ employee, who had &quot;regular dealings&quot; with Kenny in the 2000s, said at the time he was &quot;really good at what he does&quot; and &quot;works very hard to make both his radio show and the &quot;Late Late&quot; as good as possible.&quot; Kenny was said to be &quot;very good at doling out praise and encouragement, particularly to younger members of staff&quot;. When he was confronted live on air in 2006 by Paul Stokes, Kenny consoled Stokes&#x27; daughter—Aoife—who happened to a researcher on the show at the time.

===2008 High Court case===
In April 2008 Kenny and his neighbour went to court over the issue of who owned a nearby field. Kenny&#x27;s case was that he had entitlement of &#x27;Gorse Hill&#x27; through adverse possession sometimes known as squatters rights. During proceedings it was claimed that Kenny placed a lock on the field without telling his neighbour. It was also claimed that Kenny came at him with &#x27;fists raised&#x27; and &#x27;jostled&#x27; or fought with him. Kenny also claimed damages for his neighbour&#x27;s assault on him. The case was settled with Kenny buying the land for an undisclosed sum and both sides paying their own costs.

===Unauthorised advertisements===
In February 2019 Kenny became a high-profile victim of the fake news phenomenon when it was reported that unauthorised advertisements for erectile dysfunction cures bearing the presenter&#x27;s likeness had been circulated online. Taking to his Newstalk radio show, Kenny blasted the adverts as &quot;a scam&quot; and advised listeners not to &quot;buy [erectile dysfunction medication] with [Kenny&#x27;s] imagined recommendation&quot;.

===Reaction to &quot;Golfgate&quot;===
In the wake of the Oireachtas Golf Society scandal which engulfed Irish politics during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kenny spoke out in defence of his erstwhile RTÉ colleague and rival for the airwaves Sean O&#x27;Rourke, who was cut adrift by the national broadcaster for his actions during the scandal. Kenny, himself a keen golfer, described the reaction to O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s carousing with politicians as &quot;ridiculous&quot;. He has criticised the general response of the Irish government to COVID-19, accusing those in power of &quot;pandering to populists and looking over their shoulders at the publicans&#x27;, farming and hoteliers&#x27; lobbies&quot;.

<text>Wild haggis (given the humorous taxonomic designation &quot;Haggis scoticus&quot;) is a fictional creature of Scottish folklore, said to be native to the Scottish Highlands. It is comically claimed to be the source of haggis, a traditional Scottish dish that is in fact made from the innards of sheep (including heart, lungs, and liver).

According to some sources, the wild haggis&#x27;s left and right legs are of different lengths (cf. Sidehill gouger or Dahu), allowing it to run quickly around the steep mountains and hillsides which make up its natural habitat, but only in one direction. It is further claimed that there are two varieties of haggis, one with longer left legs and the other with longer right legs. The former variety can run clockwise around a mountain (as seen from above) while the latter can run anticlockwise. The two varieties coexist peacefully but are unable to interbreed in the wild because in order for the male of one variety to mate with a female of the other, he must turn to face in the same direction as his intended mate, causing him to lose his balance before he can mount her. As a result of this difficulty, differences in leg length among the haggis population are accentuated.

==Haggis abroad==
The notion of the wild haggis is widely believed to have, though does not always include, the idea of mismatched legs. According to an online survey commissioned by haggis manufacturers Hall&#x27;s of Broxburn, released on 26 November 2003, one-third of U.S. visitors to Scotland believed the wild haggis to be a real creature.

<doc id="239687" wikidata="Q543323" url="?curid=239687" title="Great saphenous vein">
<text>The great saphenous vein (GSV) or long saphenous vein () is a large, subcutaneous, superficial vein of the leg. It is the longest vein in the body, running along the length of the lower limb, returning blood from the foot, leg and thigh to the deep femoral vein at the femoral triangle.

==Structure==
The great saphenous vein originates from where the dorsal vein of the big toe (the hallux) merges with the dorsal venous arch of the foot. After passing in front of the medial malleolus (where it often can be visualized and palpated), it runs up the medial side of the leg. At the knee, it runs over the posterior border of the medial epicondyle of the femur bone. In the proximal anterior thigh inferolateral to the pubic tubercle, the great saphenous vein dives down deep through the cribriform fascia of the saphenous opening to join the femoral vein. It forms an arch, the saphenous arch, to join the common femoral vein in the region of the femoral triangle at the sapheno-femoral junction.

===Tributaries===

Several veins join the great saphenous vein, but may not all present in every individual. Most of them join it near its junction with the common femoral vein (CFV), at various average distances from this junction:

At the ankle, the great saphenous vein receives branches from the sole of the foot through the medial marginal vein; in the lower leg it anastomoses freely with the small saphenous vein, communicates by perforator veins (Cockett perforators) with the anterior and posterior tibial veins and receives many cutaneous veins; near the knee it communicates with the popliteal vein by the Boyd perforator, in the thigh it communicates with the femoral vein by perforator veins (Dodd perforator) and receives numerous tributaries; those from the medial and posterior parts of the thigh frequently unite to form a large accessory saphenous vein which joins the main vein near the sapheno-femoral junction.

Near the fossa ovalis it is joined by the superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac vein, and superficial external pudendal veins.

The thoracoepigastric vein runs along the lateral aspect of the trunk between the superficial epigastric vein below and the lateral thoracic vein above and establishes an important communication between the femoral vein and the axillary vein.

==Clinical significance==
Pathology of the great saphenous vein is relatively common, but in isolation typically not life-threatening.
* Varicose veins: The great saphenous vein, like other superficial veins, can become varicose; swollen, twisted and lengthened, and generally considered to be unsightly. Varicose veins are not life-threatening and various treatment options are available. However, when the diameter of the vein is too large for the valves within it to coapt completely, the resulting condition, chronic venous insufficiency, can result in skin color changes in the calf and ulcers that may persist for years if the vein is not ablated.
* Thrombophlebitis: The GSV can thrombose. This type of phlebitis of the GSV is usually not life-threatening in isolation; however, if the blood clot is located near the sapheno-femoral junction or near a perforator vein, a clot fragment can migrate to the deep venous system and to the pulmonary circulation. Also it can be associated with, or progress to a deep vein thrombosis which must be treated promptly. So a GSV thrombosis is investigated by ultrasonography to detect if these complications are present.

===Use in cardiovascular procedures===
The vein is often removed by cardiac surgeons and used for autotransplantation in coronary artery bypass operations, when arterial grafts are not available or many grafts are required, such as in a triple bypass or quadruple bypass.

The great saphenous vein is the conduit of choice for vascular surgeons, when available, for performing peripheral arterial bypass operations. The saphenous vein may undergo vein graft failure after engraftment, but still it has superior long-term patency compared to synthetic grafts (PTFE, PETE (Dacron)), human umbilical vein grafts or biosynthetic grafts [Omniflow]. Often, it is used &quot;in situ&quot; (in place), after tying off smaller tributaries and destruction of the venous valves with a device called valvulotome, e.g. LeMaitre&#x27;s valvulotome.

Removal of the saphenous vein will not materially hinder normal circulation in the leg. The blood that previously flowed through the saphenous vein will change its course of travel. This is known as collateral circulation.

The saphenous nerve that runs with the upper part of the great saphenous vein is a branch of the femoral nerve. It can be damaged in surgery on the vein.

===Use in emergency medicine===
When emergency resuscitation with fluids is necessary, and standard intravenous access cannot be achieved due to venous collapse, saphenous vein cutdown may be utilized.

== Etymology ==
The terms &quot;saphaina&quot; (Greek, meaning &quot;manifest&quot;, &quot;to be clearly seen&quot;) as well as &quot;safin&quot; (Arabic, &quot;صَافِن&quot; meaning &quot;deep/embedded&quot;) have been claimed as the origin for the word &quot;saphenous&quot;.

<doc id="239688" wikidata="Q1683808" url="?curid=239688" title="HMT Rohna">
<text>HMT &quot;Rohna was a [[British India Steam Navigation Company]] [[Passenger ship|passenger]] and [[cargo liner]] that was built on [[River Tyne|Tyneside]] in 1926 asSS &quot;Rohna and requisitioned as a troop ship in 1940. (&quot;HMT&quot; stands for His Majesty&#x27;s Transport.) &quot;Rohna&quot; was sunk in the Mediterranean in November 1943 by a Henschel Hs 293 guided glide bomb launched by a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft. More than 1,100 people were killed, most of whom were US troops.

==Building==
In 1925, British India Line ordered two new ships for its Madras–Nagapatam–Singapore service. They were sister ships but were built by different shipyards and had different engines. Hawthorn Leslie and Company built &quot;Rohna&quot; at its shipyard at Hebburn on Tyneside. Barclay, Curle and Company built in Glasgow on Clydeside. Both ships were launched and completed in 1926.

&quot;Rohna&quot; was launched on 24 August 1926 and completed on 5 November. She was named after a village in Sonipat, Punjab, India. She had 15 corrugated furnaces that heated five single-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of . These fed steam at 215 lbf/in2 to two four-cylinder quadruple expansion steam engines, developing a total of 984 NHP. Each engine drove one of the ship&#x27;s twin screws, giving &quot;Rohna&quot; 984 NHP or 5,000 ihp. She achieved on her sea trials and had a cruising speed of .

By 1934, &quot;Rohna&quot; carried wireless direction finding equipment.

==Civilian service==
Instead of taking up her Madras–Nagapatam–Singapore route immediately, &quot;Rohna&quot; spent her first six months of service taking military reinforcements to Shanghai. As a result, she did not start her intended service until June 1927.

===Cyclone in Madras===
On 31 October 1927, &quot;Rohna&quot; was moored to a buoy in Madras Harbour in India when a weather signal and falling air pressure warned of the approach of a tropical cyclone. Her Master, EG Carré, had her starboard anchor laid out with of cable, and got the engineers to raise steam so that her main engines could be started if needed.

By 0700 hrs on 1 November, a heavy swell was running within the harbour, at times lifting the four-ton mooring buoy completely out of the water. By 1100 hrs there was also heavy rain and &quot;Rohna&quot;″s bridge ordered the engines to &quot;stand by&quot;. Ten minutes later the anchor cable parted, shaking the ship. She was now dragging her port anchor, which Captain Carré therefore decided to have hauled in.

Weighing anchor would take about 20 minutes, so in the meantime Carré had &quot;Rohna&quot; get under way to avoid being run onto the harbour breakwater. Other ships were moored in the harbour, and Carré&#x27;s helmsman had to steer through a narrow space between two of them in a very heavy sea. Eventually &quot;Rohna&quot; was able to make for the harbour mouth and put to sea and head 20 miles south to where the storm was less severe. Next day the cyclone had passed and &quot;Rohna&quot; returned to port.

===Deck passengers===
When new, &quot;Rohna&quot; was certified to carry 5,064 deck passengers. In 1931, new regulations called the Simla Rules (superseded in 1948 by the SOLAS Convention) reduced this to 3,851, but this was still more than any other UK-registered ship.

==War service==
When the UK entered the Second World War in September 1939 &quot;Rohna&quot; was in the Indian Ocean. Apart from a voyage from Karachi to Suez with Convoy K 4, &quot;Rohna&quot; operated unescorted between Rangoon and Madras until late November. On 10 December she left Bombay for the Mediterranean, passing through the Suez Canal on 20–21 December and reaching Marseille on 26 December. From 3 January 1940 until 10 March she operated unescorted between Marseille and Port of Haifa in Mandatory Palestine, at first in convoys but after 29 January independently.

On 15 March 1940 &quot;Rohna&quot; returned through the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean, where she operated unescorted between Bombay, Rangoon, and Colombo until June. In May she was requisitioned as a troop ship and on 6 June she left Bombay for Durban. She then ran between Durban, Mombasa, and Dar es Salaam until 28 July when she left Mombasa for Bombay.

&quot;Rohna&quot; took troops from Bombay to Suez in August 1940 in Convoy BN 3 and from Bombay to Port Sudan in September/October 1940 in Convoy BN 6. She made further trips from Bombay to Suez in November 1940 in Convoy BN 8A, from Colombo to Suez in February 1941 in Convoy US 8/1 and from Bombay to Singapore in March 1941 in Convoy BM 4. The day after the Iraqi &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in April 1941 &quot;Rohna&quot; was ordered to Karachi, whence she took some of the first elements of Iraqforce to Basra in Convoy BP 2. During the Anglo-Iraqi War in May the ship made a second trip from Karachi to Basra in Convoy BP 5. After the Allied victory in Iraq at the end of May she spent the rest of the year running between Basra and Bombay, each time going to Basra in a BP-series convoys and returning independently.

On 8 December 1941 Japan invaded Malaya. A month later &quot;Rohna&quot; left Bombay for Singapore in Convoy BM 10, arriving on 25 January 1942. She left on 28 January in Convoy NB 1, a fortnight before Singapore was surrendered to Japan. From March 1942 &quot;Rohna&quot; spent a year criss-crossing the Indian Ocean between Bombay, Karachi, Colombo, Basra, Aden, Suez, Khorramshahr, Bandar Abbas, Bahrain, and Âbâdân; sometimes in convoys, but much of the time unescorted. In March 1943 she sailed from Bombay in Convoy BA 40 to Aden and then independently to Suez where she passed through the canal on 6–7 April.

For the remainder of her career &quot;Rohna&quot; supported the North African Campaign, the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy. Until the beginning of July she ran independently between Alexandria, Tripoli and Sfax. From then on she sailed mostly in convoys, working between Alexandria, Malta, Tripoli, Augusta, Port Said, Bizerta, and Oran.

==Loss==

At 12:30 on 25 November 1943, &quot;Rohna&quot; and four other troop ships left Oran in French Algeria. At sea three hours later they joined Convoy KMF 26 which was passing on its way from Britain to Alexandria.

About 16:30 the next day off Bougie the convoy was attacked by 14 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Heinkel He 177A heavy bombers escorted by Junkers Ju 88 aircraft, followed by between six and nine torpedo bombers. At the time, the convoy had a limited air escort of four land-based Free French Air Force Spitfires. Later in the course of the attack, they were relieved by RAF Spitfires.
The He 177As carried Henschel Hs 293 radio-guided, rocket-boosted glide bombs, almost 30 of which they launched at the convoy. The convoy&#x27;s combined anti-aircraft fire seems to have impeded most of the attackers&#x27; attempts to guide their glide bombs onto their targets. &quot;Rohna&quot;″s DEMS gunners contributed with her machine guns, Oerlikon autocannons, and about 20 rounds from her 12-pounder gun. The convoy shot down at least two aircraft and damaged several others.

&quot;Rohna&quot; was the only casualty. About 17:15 or 17:25 an He 177A piloted by Hans Dochtermann released a glide bomb that hit &quot;Rohna&quot; on her port side at the after end of her engine room and Number Six troop deck. Men poured on deck, many of them badly wounded.

The impact was about above the water line, but it flooded the engine room, knocked out all electrical equipment including her pumps, and set the ship ablaze. The impact demolished the number four bulkhead. It also destroyed six of her 22 lifeboats and forced out the plates of her hull so that none of her surviving port boats could be lowered past them. Troops cut the falls of some of the boats causing them to fall in the sea and be swamped. Only eight boats were launched; they became overloaded with troops and most became waterlogged or capsized. The number one deck serang (boatswain), Bhowan Meetha, helped the chief officer to launch the boats. Other members of the lascar crew launched the two aft lifeboats and abandoned ship without remaining to help to launch the other boats. With number four hold afire and all communications severed, the crewmen aft had lost contact with the bridge and had no way to reach the boat deck to help with the other boats. They disobeyed orders and acted on their own.

As &quot;Rohna&quot; listed 12 degrees to starboard, her crew launched most of her 101 liferafts. By 17:50 only a few rafts remained so they took the hatch boards from number three hold and threw them overboard too. By now number four hold, just aft of the engine room, was on fire. The and cargo ship fell behind the convoy to rescue survivors, protected by the , which made a smokescreen and gave anti-aircraft cover. &quot;Clan Campbell&quot; had a high freeboard so she lowered a cargo net for survivors to use as a scramble net. The climb was about from the sea to the deck, which was difficult for many of the exhausted survivors. The wind was only Force 4, but there was a swell that prevented the rescue ships from launching their own boats.

Among the last people to leave the ship were her master, Captain TJ Murphy, the chief, second and third officers, the senior medical officer and four US soldiers. This group remained on the foredeck for about 30 minutes after the other soldiers and crew had abandoned ship. About 90 minutes after the missile hit the ship there was a rending noise, probably from the collapse of a bulkhead aft. Clouds of smoke came from number three hold and the ship settled by the stern. The group threw the last four rafts overboard and abandoned ship.

After night fell, &quot;Atherstone&quot; switched from anti-aircraft cover to rescuing survivors and the tug &quot;Mindful&quot; arrived from Bougie and joined the operation. The rescue continued until 02:15 on 27 November. In total, 819 survivors were taken to Philippeville: 602 on &quot;Pioneer&quot;, about 110 on &quot;Clan Campbell&quot; and about 70 on &quot;Atherstone&quot;.

Of the 1,138 men who were killed, 1,015 were US personnel. The attack is the largest loss of US troops at sea due to enemy action in a single incident. A further 35 US troops of the 2,000 originally embarked, later died from their wounds. As well as the troops, five of &quot;Rohna&quot;″s officers and 117 of her 195 crew were killed, along with one of her 12 DEMS gunners and one hospital orderly. USS &quot;Pioneer&quot; rescued 606 survivors.

Details of the loss were revealed slowly over time. By February 1944 the US Government had acknowledged that more than 1,000 soldiers had been lost in the sinking of an unnamed troopship in European waters, but it hinted that a submarine was responsible. By June 1945 the US Government had released accurate casualty figures, the ship had been identified as &quot;Rohna&quot;, and the cause of the sinking had been identified as German bombers, but did not mention that a guided bomb was used. The use of an &quot;aerial glider bomb&quot; was first reported publicly on 14 November 1945 in an account of the battle in the Salt Lake City Tribune. On 9 March 1947 the Chicago Tribune published a complete account of the attack including the use of a &quot;radio-controlled [sic] glider bomb.&quot; In 1948 a history of British India Line in the Second World War was published stating &quot;the missile was one of the new glider bombs guided by wireless.&quot; The US Government officially released the remaining details of the incident, specifically that a radio-controlled glide bomb had been used, in 1967 after the passing of the Freedom of Information Act.

==Monuments==
Members of &quot;Rohna&quot;″s crew who were killed are commemorated in the Second World War section of the Merchant Navy War Memorial at Tower Hill in London. Her lascar seamen are commemorated in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission monuments at Chittagong and Mumbai. A monument to the US troops who were killed was unveiled at Fort Mitchell National Cemetery in Seale, Alabama in 1996. In 1962, the traffic median of the Esplanade in Bronx, New York, at the corner of Astor Avenue, was named in memory of Private Sidney Weissman, a local resident killed in the sinking of the &quot;Rohna&quot;. On 31 May 2021, a bridge in Gardner, Massachusetts was dedicated to honor US Cpl. Lawrence Lukasevicius, a Gardner resident who was one of the soldiers killed while on the &quot;Rohna.&quot;

==Controversy==
In 1998 Dr James G. Bennett, who lost a brother in the sinking, published a book, &quot;The Rohna Disaster&quot;, through the self-publishing service Xlibris. In it he alleges that the heavy loss of life was due to the incompetence and cowardice of the &quot;Rohna&quot;″s lascar crew and faulty safety procedures and equipment aboard.

In 2002 the History Channel released an episode of its &quot;History Undercover&quot; series, &quot;The Rohna Disaster: WWII&#x27;s Secret Tragedy&quot;, that was based on Bennett&#x27;s book and repeated his allegations. Wartime reports by the lieutenant colonel in command of the US troops aboard, and by &quot;Rohna&quot;″s second officer and other survivors, contradict Bennett&#x27;s allegations.

<doc id="239693" wikidata="Q613241" url="?curid=239693" title="Kirby (character)">
<text>is the titular character and protagonist of the &quot;Kirby&quot; series of video games developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo. He first appeared in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; (1992), a platform game for the Game Boy. Since then, Kirby has appeared in over 50 games, ranging from action platformers to puzzle, racing, and pinball, and has been featured as a playable character in every installment of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series (1999–present). He has also starred in his own and manga series. Since 1999, he has been voiced by Makiko Ohmoto.

Kirby&#x27;s signature skill is his ability to inhale objects or creatures and spit them out as projectiles, as well as the ability to suck in air to float over obstacles. His Copy Ability grants him the power to adopt the abilities of the creatures he inhales, while also wearing various costumes or transforming his shape. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, such as his homeworld Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare. On these adventures, he often crosses paths with his rivals, King Dedede and Meta Knight. In virtually all of his appearances, Kirby is depicted as a cheerful, innocent, and food-loving character.

Kirby has been regarded as one of the most iconic video game characters of all time, as well as one of the cutest and most lovable. He has achieved high popularity with gamers in Japan. He has also been praised for being one of the most versatile characters, due to starring in a large catalogue of games that cuts across a variety of video game genres.

==Concept and creation==
Kirby was created by Masahiro Sakurai as the player character of the 1992 video game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;. Sakurai conceived the idea around May 1990 at the age of 19 while he was working at HAL Laboratory. The character&#x27;s design was intended to serve as a placeholder graphic for the game&#x27;s original protagonist in early development and thus was given a simplistic ball-like appearance. Sakurai switched to the placeholder design after deciding that it served the character better. The character was known as during development, as the first game was planned to be titled &quot;Harukaze Popopo&quot; (lit. &quot;Spring Breeze Popopo&quot;, or &quot;Popopo of the Spring Breeze&quot;). The game was later renamed to &quot;Twinkle Popo&quot;; however, after Nintendo became involved in its release, Nintendo and HAL chose to change the name of the game and its protagonist so that it would appeal to Western audiences. The name &quot;Kirby&quot; was chosen from a list of potential names provided by Nintendo of America. Shigeru Miyamoto stated that &quot;Kirby&quot; was chosen partly in honor of American lawyer John Kirby, who defended Nintendo in the &quot;Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.&quot; case, and partly because the harsh-sounding name contrasted amusingly with the character&#x27;s cute appearance.

Reflecting on Kirby&#x27;s design, Sakurai said that he wanted to create &quot;a cute main character who everyone will love&quot;. Satoru Iwata added that Kirby was given a simple, circular design so that anyone would be able to draw him. The BBC quoted &quot;Negative World&quot;: &quot;Kirby has a great design. He&#x27;s expressive, iconic, instantly-recognisable, and easy for kids to draw.&quot;

Kirby appears white in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; due to the grayscale palette of the Game Boy system. Sakurai always intended the character to be pink, though this was unknown to the development team at first; in particular, Miyamoto thought that Kirby would have been yellow based upon similar characters, but thought that pink was a more distinctive choice. Kirby appears white in the game&#x27;s North American promotional materials and artwork to reflect the character&#x27;s in-game appearance. Miyamoto&#x27;s color choice was repurposed in some games for secondary players.

In a miniseries on YouTube where he discussed the development of &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;, Sakurai said that he wanted Kirby to fly because he thought it would be unfair for the player to lose a life by missing a jump. He also had the idea of Kirby using his tongue to grab enemies similarly to Yoshi, but then decided to have him inhale and spit them out instead. For the development of the second game titled &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, Iwata said that the team had started with over 40 abilities before reducing them to the number in the final game. These originally included the ability to shrink, create blocks, ride a rocket, and also an animal ability that involved scratching and biting enemies.

HAL Laboratory executive director, Shinya Kumazaki said that Kirby is a neutral character, designed to reflect the player&#x27;s emotions in the game, and for this reason, he does not express strong emotions that could conflict with the player. For a period of time beginning with 2002&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Kirby consistently appeared in North American promotional material with a more serious expression than in Japan, where his expression was cheerful. Kumazaki said that the more battle-ready appearance was intended to appeal to a wider audience in North America, based on feedback and market research from Nintendo of America. Discussing Kirby&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Nightmare in Dream Land&quot;, Sakurai said that Kirby&#x27;s voice acting had been purposefully restricted because clear speech would have seemed unnatural for a pixelated sprite character, and could typecast him as a particular type of character.

Kirby&#x27;s spherical shape presented certain challenges when transitioning him to a 3D character. Tatsuya Kamiyama at HAL Laboratory explained that it was difficult to determine which direction he was facing when viewed from behind, which meant that facing enemies correctly in order to inhale and spit them out could create frustration. This was particularly problematic for ranged attacks, so for &quot;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&quot; a subtle, automatic homing system was developed to help the player target nearby enemies. Kumazaki said that the Mouthful Mode concept began by asking what Kirby is and exploring his shape-shifting nature, as the team wanted him to have inhuman abilities. He also said that although Kirby&#x27;s Mouthful Mode appears to give him the ability to hold anything in his mouth, there are rules governing what he can swallow. During development, the team focused on defining the different shapes he could make and what he could do with the shapes, rather than giving him new powers. He also explained that the core concept of each game in the series is to make Kirby the hero, although the character has no aspirations or sense of morality due to being a pure, blank slate character.

=== Portrayal ===
Since &quot;Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards&quot; (2000), Kirby has been voiced by Japanese voice actress Makiko Ohmoto. She also voiced him in every title in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, beginning with the first &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; game in 1999.

==Characteristics==
Kirby hails from Planet Popstar, a yellow star, and spends most of his time in a territory called Dream Land. He has a pink, spherical, body with small stubby arms and large red feet. His body composition has not been revealed, but Kumazaki stated that his animation is based on &quot;a human running energetically, with the thighs, knees, and ankles invisible, but nevertheless accounted for&quot;. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch or flatten and adopt different shapes, open his mouth very wide to inhale foes, or inflate himself with air and fly. Despite this malleability, certain parts of Kirby do not stretch in order to maintain his cuteness, such as the distance between his two eyes and between his eyes and mouth. Kirby is characterised by his childlike innocence and his insatiable appetite. When he swallows enemies, Kirby does not digest them in his stomach. Instead, they disappear and reappear somewhere in the game world. Kirby&#x27;s official height is 20 cm (about 8 in).

Kirby&#x27;s gender is listed as &quot;unknown&quot; in the &quot;Kirby&quot; series encyclopedia . Sakurai wrote Kirby&#x27;s profile, which also lists the character&#x27;s gender as &quot;unknown&quot; and once jokingly questioned whether Kirby could actually be female. Likewise, Makiko Ohmoto stated that Kirby&#x27;s gender is unknown and explained that she performs the character just as &quot;Kirby&quot; without caring about the character&#x27;s gender. The English manual for &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; refers to Kirby as a &quot;little boy&quot;, whereas the Japanese version uses , which translates to a gender-neutral &quot;youngster&quot; or &quot;young person&quot;, though is more frequently used for males.

When asked what sort of being Kirby is, Kumazaki said that he is an &quot;always-shifting and mysterious individual&quot;. HAL Laboratory producer Tadashi Kamitake said that Kirby has a unique personality, but is also like a blank sheet of paper, as he can transform into anything that he sucks up. He explained that because he embodies these two opposite extremes, he can be an indestructible superhero while also being a friend.

===Abilities===

Kirby&#x27;s signature ability involves inhaling enemies and objects, then either swallowing them or spitting them out with incredible force. He also has the ability to fly. &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; introduced the Copy Ability, allowing Kirby to mimic the abilities of his foes by swallowing them, giving him a variety of powers, such as breathing fire. Instead of finding and using power-ups, Kirby uses his enemies as power-ups. &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; expanded on the concept of the Copy Ability by introducing multi-functional techniques for each ability. In &quot;Kirby Super Star,&quot; Kirby can sacrifice his current Copy Ability to create a &quot;Helper&quot;, which can be controlled by the game or a second player. &quot;Kirby Star Allies&quot; (2018) has a similar mechanic where he can create small pink hearts that can be thrown at enemies to turn them into an ally. Since &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, the &quot;Kirby&quot; games have introduced a large variety of Copy Abilities, which grant him numerous powers and costumes, including Sword, in which he obtains a sword and appearance similar to Link, Artist, where his creations come to life, and Needle, where he wears a spiky hat. &quot;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&quot; further evolved Kirby&#x27;s skills by allowing the player to upgrade his Copy Abilities multiple times, making them even more powerful, such as his Fire ability, which can be upgraded to Volcano Fire and Dragon Fire. The game&#x27;s Mouthful Mode mechanic gives Kirby the ability to inhale objects, such as a car, and embody its shape and function.

==Appearances==
===Main series===

Since his debut in 1992, Kirby has been the protagonist of the &quot;Kirby&quot; series. Most &quot;Kirby&quot; games are platform games, but his large catalogue also cuts across a variety of genres, including pinball, fighting, racing, block puzzle, and party games. Throughout his adventures, Kirby has been pitted against various enemies, including the primary antagonist of the series, a recurring penguin called King Dedede.
Kirby made his debut on the Game Boy in 1992 in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;, a 2D side-scrolling platform game that introduced his ability to suck, swallow, and spit out enemies as projectiles alongside other moves such as running, jumping and flying. The obtainable food items in the game act as power-ups and grant him a variety of abilities. Upon reaching the end of a level, Kirby confronts a final boss, such as Whispy Woods or King Dedede. Due to the Game Boy screen&#x27;s limited colour palette, he appeared in grey rather than his typical pink hue. A year later, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; on the NES introduced his copy ability and other moves, such as the ability to dash and slide kick, and a recurring rival named Meta Knight. Kirby&#x27;s appearance was nearly identical to his previous iteration, although he was slightly shorter, his body was rendered in pink and his face was enhanced with dark pink ovals. He again combats King Dedede, but must also defeat an entity named Nightmare, whom he accidentally releases with the Star Rod. In 1995, another platform game was released on the Game Boy titled &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land 2.&quot; Kirby is accompanied by three animal friends who aid him during his adventure named Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the fish. His in-game appearance was returned to grey, and he was slightly taller than his NES incarnation, although he is pink in the game&#x27;s box art. In the extended finale, Kirby battles a boss called Dark Matter, an entity that transforms into a one-eyed black orb. In 1996, &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot; was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, a compilation of eight mini-games, such as &quot;Gourmet Race&quot;, where Kirby races against King Dedede in a food collecting competition. It was the first game to introduce helpers controlled by the game or by another player and also gave Kirby various hats to illustrate his various copy abilities. In 1997, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land 3&quot;, which released on the SNES, introduced new animal friends for Kirby, including Nago the cat and ChuChu the octopus. Kirby again defeats Dark Matter, only to face a monstrous white entity with a single eye named Zero.

&quot;Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards,&quot; which released on the Nintendo 64 in 2000, introduced 3D computer graphics. Kirby&#x27;s form became perfectly spherical. His skills were upgraded by combining two of the same abilities to create stronger effects or combining two different abilities to create a new effect. Kirby&#x27;s earlier enemies Dark Matter and Zero returned as new bosses in the forms of Miracle Matter and Zero2. In 2004, &quot;Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror&quot; released on the Game Boy Advance. It was the first game in the series to feature cooperative multiplayer for four players. Kirby can copy the abilities of enemies to progress into new areas before facing a boss. The game granted Kirby some new abilities, such as Cupid, which gives him the power to fly and shoot arrows with a bow. The 2006 game &quot;&quot; was another 2D platformer, this time released on the Nintendo DS. Kirby can swallow multiple abilities and combine some of them to create new abilities. By using Ability Scrolls, his equipped skills can be upgraded to make them more powerful. He can also interact with the environment, such as cut grass or melt ice. In the 2011 platform game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land&quot; on the Wii, Kirby returned to the visuals and gameplay of &quot;The Crystal Shards&quot; but with four-player multiplay added. He uses his usual copy abilities but gained some new ones, including Super Inhale, which is made more powerful by shaking the Wii Remote.

&quot;&quot;, which released on the Nintendo 3DS in 2014, introduced new copy abilities, such as Beetle and Archer. By collecting a Miracle Fruit, Kirby can transform into Hypernova Kirby, which allows him to inhale much larger objects. In 2016, gained new abilities and a mech suit called the Robobot armour in &quot;&quot;, which released on the 3DS. The Robobot increases Kirby&#x27;s power and can gain copy abilities like Kirby. In 2018, the Nintendo Switch game &quot;Kirby Star Allies&quot; incorporated elements from previous games in the series, including Kirby&#x27;s copy ability, dash, and sliding kick. It was designed for four-player cooperative play, allowing Kirby to beat stages alongside his allies. With the release of the Switch game &quot;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&quot; in 2022, Kirby transitioned to a fully 3D environment. Alongside new copy abilities like Ranger and Drill, the game introduced Mouthful Mode, in which Kirby expands his mouth to fit around objects to adopt their shape and absorb their abilities.

=== Spin-off games ===
Kirby has appeared in multiple spin-off games. In 1993, he was transformed into a pinball in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot; on the Game Boy. The following year, he returned in the form of a golf ball in the SNES game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course&quot;, which requires the player to hit him around various golf courses. In 1995, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche&quot; was released for a Western audience by rebranding the Japanese puzzle game game &quot;Super Poyo Poyo&quot; for the &quot;Kirby&quot; series. Two further &quot;Kirby&quot; games released that year titled &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Block Ball&quot;, a game that is similar to &quot;Breakout&quot; but features power-ups and boss encounters, and &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Toy Box&quot;, a game released exclusively in Japan on the Satellaview that features eight games, including baseball, pinball and pachinko. Kirby appeared in the 1997 Game Boy puzzle game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Star Stacker&quot;, in which stars are sandwiched between matching blocks featuring Kirby&#x27;s animal friends. In the 2001 Game Boy Color game &quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble&quot;, Kirby is rolled around a course in search of stars while avoiding various obstacles. The following year, he appeared in &quot;&quot;, an updated version of the NES game. In 2003, he returned to the GameCube in &quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot;, a racing game that involves steering Kirby around the track and inhaling enemies. &quot;Kirby Canvas Curse&quot; was his first game on the Nintendo DS and involved the use of the stylus to draw a path for his movement, stun enemies and activate copy abilities. In 2010, Kirby&#x27;s appearance changed dramatically from a solid object to an outline of yarn in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Epic Yarn&quot;. In 2011, Kirby returned on the DS for &quot;Kirby Mass Attack&quot;, in which up to ten Kirbys are controlled by tapping the screen. A sequel to &quot;Canvas Curse&quot; released in 2015 on the Wii U titled &quot;Kirby and the Rainbow Curse&quot;. It involves controlling Kirby with the stylus on the game pad by painting paths and tapping him to dash. Kirby stars in a 2017 brawler on the 3DS titled &quot;Kirby Battle Royale&quot;, in which he fights other Kirbys in various arenas. In 2019, &quot;Super Kirby Clash&quot; released on the Nintendo Switch, which involves up to four players playing as a Kirby to take on several boss battles using various roles. The following year, &quot;Kirby Fighters 2&quot; released on the Switch, which is a fighting game involving 17 playable Kirbys that each have a specific copy ability. In 2022, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet&quot; was released on the Switch, where up to four players can compete as Kirby in a race to eat the most strawberries.

===&quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series and other games===
Kirby appears in every game in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, also created by Sakurai, as a playable character. As in the main series, Kirby is able to use copy-based transitions to copy the abilities and appearance of opponents, such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, and Samus. In &quot;Ultimate&quot;, he plays a starring role in the &quot;World of Light&quot; story mode, in which he is the only survivor of Galeem&#x27;s massacre out of all of the other fighters. Sakurai stated that, after a process of elimination, Kirby was the obvious choice due to his Warp Star providing a reasonable explanation for his escape. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (2008), Kirby&#x27;s Final Smash is his Cook ability, which cooks opponents in a pot. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; (2014) and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018), Kirby&#x27;s Final Smash is an Ultra Sword attack.

Kirby has made cameo appearances in several other video games. A pink Kirby character appears in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;. In 1992, he appeared in the opening cutscene of &quot;Arcana&quot;. He has also made a minor appearance in the &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; series.

===In other media===

Kirby appears in his own anime titled &quot;Kirby: Right Back at Ya!&quot;, (Japanese: 星のカービィ &quot;Hoshi no Kābī&quot;), which aired from 2001 to 2003 in Japan. The series was licensed in North America by 4Kids Entertainment and aired in the United States from 2002 to 2006, consisting of 100 episodes. The anime is based loosely on the games, but with some differences. Like his game counterpart, anime Kirby is unable to speak in complete sentences and is presented like a baby. He is described as a &quot;Star Warrior&quot; and his Copy Ability is powered by his Warp Star. The series begins with him crashing his Starship in Cappy Town on Planet Popstar, where he befriends Tiff and Tuff. In the story, he encounters King Dedede, the greedy, selfish ruler, and Meta Knight, and faces the overarching villain, eNeMeE.

Kirby also stars in several manga adaptations. The longest-running series, &quot;Kirby of the Stars: The Story of Dedede Who Lives in Pupupu&quot;, was serialized in &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; from 1994 to 2006, which has been compiled into 25 tankōbon volumes, with over 10 million copies being printed. It continued serialization in &quot;CoroCoro Aniki&quot; in 2017. Viz Media originally planned to release the manga in English in September 2010, but it was pushed back and eventually cancelled. The series was later published as a &quot;best-of&quot; collection, which also features new chapters from its continued serialization, and was published in English as &quot;Kirby Manga Mania&quot; by Viz Media.

== Promotion and reception ==
Kirby has been widely merchandised across a large variety of products. He has been created in the form of statues and numerous plush toys. Two amiibo of Kirby were released for the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series and for the &quot;Kirby&quot; series in 2014 and 2016. A limited edition Nendoroid of Kirby was produced for the character&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

Steve Watts of &quot;GameSpot&quot; felt that Kirby is one of the most versatile Nintendo characters, second only to Mario, due to his large catalogue of experimental games and art styles. The 2011 &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; lists Kirby as the 18th most popular video game character. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; listed Kirby as one of the most lovable blobs, calling him one of the cutest things to appear in a Nintendo game, yet also describing the way he defeats his enemies as &quot;horrific&quot;. Marc Normandin writing for &quot;Paste&quot; opined that Kirby is the most powerful character in all of media, noting that his ability to inhale enemies and steal their powers &quot;makes him effectively unstoppable&quot; and that his evolution proves that he has become more powerful over time. Due to his popularity with gamers, Kirby became the subject of a meme in 2017, which depicted him with realistic legs or feet, thereby transforming him into a grotesque character.

Kirby is a controversial character with competitive &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; players. Maddy Myers of &quot;Kotaku&quot; commented that in the first &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; game, he was hugely overpowered, being both fast and hard-hitting. His ability to swallow opponents and spit them out over the edge of the platform could be dangerous for competitors, particularly when using a technique known as &quot;Kirbycide&quot;, which involves leaping off the edge and pulling the opponent down, killing both, while still achieving a victory. With the release of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, Kirby&#x27;s status amongst players took a nosedive due to his movement speed being drastically reduced. Although this was increased in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, his reputation had already been severely damaged amongst professional players. Ozzie Mejia of &quot;Shacknews&quot; noted that by &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, Kirby&#x27;s moveset had improved despite being largely the same as in the previous games. His moves were also much faster and he had the ability to swallow projectiles and fire them back at opponents as a star. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Kirby as the best &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; character, praising his absorbing ability as one of the best things in the game, in particular his ability to steal opponents&#x27; powers but also take on an aspect of their appearance.

Bryan Lufkin of &quot;Wired&quot; described Kirby as a &quot;true videogame icon&quot;, citing his enduring appeal as a cute, child-friendly character. He said that his popularity is not only due to his loveable appearance, but also the simplicity of his gameplay and his ability to be moulded into different situations. He further commented that, despite not being as well known as Mario, Kirby&#x27;s success makes him a &quot;money-making machine&quot; for Nintendo. Steven T. Wright of &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted that although Kirby is a beloved Nintendo character, his games have not been huge sellers over the years until the release of &quot;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&quot;, but opined that his inclusion in the original &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; game had successfully boosted his popularity. To celebrate Kirby&#x27;s 20th anniversary, his fans broke a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; in September 2012 at Penny Arcade Expo for the most people blowing chewing gum bubbles at the same time. Kirby is incredibly popular in Japan. In 2019, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; reported that he was consistently voted the most popular Nintendo character by readers of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Nintendo Dream&quot;. Due to his popularity, Nintendo and HAL Laboratory have operated a chain of Kirby-themed restaurants named Kirby Café, which began operating in 2016 with temporary pop up restaurants opening in Osaka, Tokyo and Nagoya. Permanent restaurants later opened in the Tokyo Solamachi shopping complex and Hakata, with an Osaka location due to open in 2024.

<text>The quater-imaginary numeral system is a numeral system, first proposed by Donald Knuth in 1960. Unlike standard numeral systems, which use an integer (such as 10 in decimal, or 2 in binary) as their bases, it uses the imaginary number formula_1 (such that formula_2) as its base. It is able to (almost) uniquely represent every complex number using only the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3. Numbers less than zero, which are ordinarily represented with a minus sign, are representable as digit strings in quater-imaginary; for example, the number −1 is represented as &quot;103&quot; in quater-imaginary notation.

==Decomposing the quater-imaginary==
In a positional system with base formula_3, 

formula_4 

representsformula_5

In this numeral system, formula_6,

and because formula_2, the entire series of powers can be separated into two different series, so that it simplifies to formula_8 for even-numbered digits (digits that simplify to the value of the digit times a power of -4), and formula_9 for those digits that still have an imaginary factor. Adding these two series together then gives the total value of the number.

Because of the separation of these two series, the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers are readily expressed in base −4 as formula_10 and formula_11 respectively.

==Converting from quater-imaginary==
To convert a digit string from the quater-imaginary system to the decimal system, the standard formula for positional number systems can be used. This says that a digit string formula_12 in base &quot;b&quot; can be converted to a decimal number using the formula
:formula_13
For the quater-imaginary system, formula_6.

Additionally, for a given string formula_15 in the form formula_16, the formula below can be used for a given string length formula_17 in base formula_3
:formula_19

===Example===
To convert the string formula_20 to a decimal number, fill in the formula above:
:formula_21

Another, longer example: formula_22 in base 10 is
:formula_23

==Converting into quater-imaginary==
It is also possible to convert a decimal number to a number in the quater-imaginary system. Every complex number (every number of the form &quot;a&quot;+&quot;bi&quot;) has a quater-imaginary representation. Most numbers have a unique quater-imaginary representation, but just as 1 has the two representations 1 = 0. in decimal notation, so, because of 0.2&quot;i&quot; = , the number has the two quater-imaginary representations 0.2&quot;i&quot; = 3· = = 1 + 3· = 1.2&quot;i&quot;.

To convert an arbitrary complex number to quater-imaginary, it is sufficient to split the number into its real and imaginary components, convert each of those separately, and then add the results by interleaving the digits. For example, since −1+4&quot;i&quot; is equal to −1 plus 4&quot;i&quot;, the quater-imaginary representation of −1+4&quot;i&quot; is the quater-imaginary representation of −1 (namely, 103) plus the quater-imaginary representation of 4&quot;i&quot; (namely, 20), which gives a final result of −1+4&quot;i&quot; = 1232&quot;i&quot;.

To find the quater-imaginary representation of the imaginary component, it suffices to multiply that component by 2&quot;i&quot;, which gives a real number; then find the quater-imaginary representation of that real number, and finally shift the representation by one place to the right (thus dividing by 2&quot;i&quot;). For example, the quater-imaginary representation of 6&quot;i&quot; is calculated by multiplying 6&quot;i&quot; × 2&quot;i&quot; = −12, which is expressed as 3002&quot;i&quot;, and then shifting by one place to the right, yielding: 6&quot;i&quot; = 302&quot;i&quot;.

Finding the quater-imaginary representation of an arbitrary real integer number can be done manually by solving a system of simultaneous equations, as shown below, but there are faster methods for both real and imaginary integers, as shown in the negative base article.

===Example: Real number===
As an example of an integer number we can try to find the quater-imaginary counterpart of the decimal number 7 (or 710 since the base of the decimal system is 10). Since it is hard to predict exactly how long the digit string will be for a given decimal number, it is safe to assume a fairly large string. In this case, a string of six digits can be chosen. When an initial guess at the size of the string eventually turns out to be insufficient, a larger string can be used.

To find the representation, first write out the general formula, and group terms: 
:formula_24

Since 7 is a real number, it is allowed to conclude that &quot;d1&quot;, &quot;d3&quot; and &quot;d5&quot; should be zero. Now the value of the coefficients &quot;d0&quot;, &quot;d2&quot; and &quot;d4&quot;, must be found. Because d0 − 4 d2 + 16 d4 = 7 and because—by the nature of the quater-imaginary system—the coefficients can only be 0, 1, 2 or 3 the value of the coefficients can be found. A possible configuration could be: &quot;d0&quot; = 3, &quot;d2&quot; = 3 and &quot;d4&quot; = 1. This configuration gives the resulting digit string for 710.

:formula_25

===Example: Imaginary number===
Finding a quater-imaginary representation of a purely imaginary integer number is analogous to the method described above for a real number. For example, to find the representation of 6&quot;i&quot;, it is possible to use the general formula. Then all coefficients of the real part have to be zero and the complex part should make 6. However, for 6&quot;i&quot; it is easily seen by looking at the formula that if &quot;d1&quot; = 3 and all other coefficients are zero, we get the desired string for 6&quot;i&quot;. That is:

:formula_26

===Another conversion method===
For real numbers the quater-imaginary representation is the same as negative quaternary (base −4). A complex number &quot;x&quot;+&quot;iy&quot; can be converted to quater-imaginary by converting &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;/2 separately to negative quaternary. If both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are finite binary fractions we can use the following algorithm using repeated Euclidean division:

For example: 35+23i=121003.22i

 35 23i/2i=11.5 11=12−0.5
 35÷(−4)=−8, remainder 3 12/(−4)=−3, remainder 0 (−0.5)×(−4)=2
 −8÷(−4)= 2, remainder 0 −3/(−4)= 1, remainder 1
 2÷(−4)= 0, remainder 2 1/(−4)= 0, remainder 1
 203 + 110 + 0.2 = 121003.2
 32i+16×2−8i−4×0+2i×0+1×3−2×i/2=35+23i

==Radix point &quot;.&quot;==
A radix point in the decimal system is the usual . (dot) which marks the separation between the integer part and the fractional part of the number. 
In the quater-imaginary system a radix point can also be used. For a digit string formula_27 the radix point marks the separation between non-negative and negative powers of &quot;b&quot;. Using the radix point the general formula becomes:

:formula_28
or
:formula_29

===Example===
If the quater-imaginary representation of the complex unit &quot;i&quot; has to be found, the formula without radix point will not suffice. Therefore, the above formula should be used. Hence:

:formula_30

for certain coefficients &quot;dk&quot;. Then because the real part has to be zero: &quot;d&quot;4 = &quot;d&quot;2 = &quot;d&quot;0 = &quot;d&quot;−2 = 0. 
For the imaginary part, if &quot;d&quot;5 = &quot;d&quot;3 = &quot;d&quot;−3 = 0 and when &quot;d&quot;1 = 1 and &quot;d&quot;−1 = 2 the digit string can be found. Using the above coefficients in the digit string the result is:

:formula_31

==Addition and subtraction==
It is possible to add and subtract numbers in the quater-imaginary system. In doing this, there are two basic rules that have to be kept in mind:

# Whenever a number exceeds 3, &quot;subtract&quot; 4 and &quot;carry&quot; −1 two places to the left.
# Whenever a number drops below 0, &quot;add&quot; 4 and &quot;carry&quot; +1 two places to the left.

Or for short: &quot;If you add four, carry +1. If you subtract four, carry −1&quot;. This is the opposite of normal long addition, in which a &quot;carry&quot; in the current column requires &quot;adding&quot; 1 to the next column to the left, and a &quot;borrow&quot; requires subtracting. In quater-imaginary arithmetic, a &quot;carry&quot; &quot;subtracts&quot; from the next-but-one column, and a &quot;borrow&quot; &quot;adds&quot;.

===Example: Addition===
Below are two examples of adding in the quater-imaginary system:

In the first example we start by adding the two 1s in the first column (the &quot;ones&#x27; column&quot;), giving 2. Then we add the two 3s in the second column (the &quot;2&quot;i&quot;s column&quot;), giving 6; 6 is greater than 3, so we subtract 4 (giving 2 as the result in the second column) and carry −1 into the fourth column. Adding the 0s in the third column gives 0; and finally adding the two 1s and the carried −1 in the fourth column gives 1.

In the second example we first add 3+1, giving 4; 4 is greater than 3, so we subtract 4 (giving 0) and carry −1 into the third column (the &quot;−4s column&quot;). Then we add 2+0 in the second column, giving 2. In the third column, we have 0+0+(−1), because of the carry; −1 is less than 0, so we add 4 (giving 3 as the result in the third column) and &quot;borrow&quot; +1 into the fifth column. In the fourth column, 1+1 is 2; and the carry in the fifth column gives 1, for a result of formula_32.

===Example: Subtraction===
Subtraction is analogous to addition in that it uses the same two rules described above. Below is an example:

In this example we have to subtract formula_33 from formula_34. The rightmost digit is 2−1 = 1. The second digit from the right would become −1, so add 4 to give 3 and then carry +1 two places to the left. The third digit from the right is 1−0 = 1. Then the leftmost digit is 1−1 plus 1 from the carry, giving 1. This gives a final answer of formula_35.

==Multiplication==
For long multiplication in the quater-imaginary system, the two rules stated above are used as well. When multiplying numbers, multiply the first string by each digit in the second string consecutively and add the resulting strings. With every multiplication, a digit in the second string is multiplied with the first string. The multiplication starts with the rightmost digit in the second string and then moves leftward by one digit, multiplying each digit with the first string.
Then the resulting partial products are added where each is shifted to the left by one digit. An example:

This corresponds to a multiplication of formula_36.

==Tabulated conversions==
Below is a table of some decimal and complex numbers and their quater-imaginary counterparts.




==Examples==
Below are some other examples of conversions from decimal numbers to quater-imaginary numbers.

:formula_37

:formula_38

:formula_39

==Z-order curve==
The representation
:formula_40
of an arbitrary complex number formula_41 with formula_42 gives rise to an injective mapping
:formula_43
with some suitable formula_44. Here formula_45 cannot be taken as base because of
:formula_46
The image formula_47 is a Cantor set which allows to linearly order formula_48 similar to a Z-order curve. Since the image is disconnected, formula_49 is not continuous.

<text>The Boston Yanks were a National Football League team based in Boston, Massachusetts, that played from 1944 to 1948. The team played its home games at Fenway Park. Any games that conflicted with the Boston Red Sox baseball schedule in the American League were held at Braves Field of the cross-town National League team, the Boston Braves. Team owner Ted Collins, who managed singer and television show host Kate Smith (1907–1986) for thirty years, picked the name Yanks because he originally wanted to run a team that played at New York City&#x27;s old Yankee Stadium. The Yanks managed only a 2–8 record during their first regular season.

Because of a shortage of players caused by World War II, the Yanks were temporarily merged with the erratic founding APFA member Dayton Triangles&#x27; franchise, then known as the Brooklyn Tigers, for the 1945 season, and styled as just the Yanks with no home city named. The merged team played four home games in Boston and one in New York and finished with a 3–6–1 record.

When Brooklyn Tigers owner Dan Topping announced his intention to join the newly established rival professional football league, the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), in 1946, his NFL franchise, which was a founding APFA member that he had moved from Dayton, Ohio in 1929, was revoked and all of its players were assigned to the Yanks, with the original Triangles legacy being carried on by this group. After three continuous losing seasons, Collins finally was allowed to move to New York City. But instead of an official relocation, he asked the league to officially fold his Boston franchise and give him a new franchise, for a Federal tax write-off. The League granted his request, and Collins named his new team the New York Bulldogs. However, like many of this franchise&#x27;s moves, the NFL considers them to have folded, while the players and assets simply moved, ultimately keeping the Dayton Triangles&#x27; legacy alive as the last remaining Ohio League member.
Despite the franchise&#x27;s assets moving to a new city and carrying on the team&#x27;s legacy, the Boston Yanks are the only officially defunct NFL team ever to have the first overall NFL draft pick. They had it twice, in 1944 and 1946, selecting quarterbacks from Notre Dame, Angelo Bertelli and Frank Dancewicz, both Massachusetts natives.

<doc id="239704" wikidata="Q1987537" url="?curid=239704" title="Buffalo team (NFL)">
<text>Buffalo, New York had a turbulent, early-era National Football League team that operated under multiple names and several different owners between the 1910s and 1920s. The early NFL-era franchise was variously called the Buffalo All-Stars from 1915 to 1917, Buffalo Niagaras in 1918, the Buffalo Prospects in 1919, Buffalo All-Americans from 1920 to 1923, Buffalo Bisons from 1924 to 1925 and in 1927 and 1929, and the Buffalo Rangers in 1926. The franchise, which was experiencing financial problems in 1928, did not participate in league play that season.

==History==

===Prior to the NFL===
Buffalo operated an early professional football circuit from at least the late 1800s onward. Among notable predecessors to the team discussed here were the Buffalo Oakdales, whose heyday was in the years 1908 and 1909 and who ceased operations c. 1915; the Cazenovias, who were New York&#x27;s best team in 1910 and 1911; and the Lancaster Malleables, from the neighboring town of Lancaster, New York, who were the best team in the region in 1913 and 1914. These teams played each other and teams from nearby cities (for example, the Rochester Jeffersons).

The All-Stars played from 1915 to 1917 under the leadership of Eugene F. Dooley; in 1917, Dooley, along with his star player Barney Lepper, took the team on a barnstorming tour of midwestern pro football teams. In 1918, the city&#x27;s teams were not allowed to play outside the area because of the 1918 flu pandemic; Dooley and Lepper discontinued the All-Stars. Shoe salesman Warren D. Patterson, at the same time as this, formed a new team known as the Buffalo Niagaras, signing former Youngstown Patricians quarterback Ernest &quot;Tommy&quot; Hughitt as his quarterback. As the Niagaras, the team won a citywide championship in 1918, going undefeated with a 6–0–0 record (including a forfeit), having only one touchdown scored on them in any of their six games. They were one of the few upper-level teams still able to play games that year, with most of the top-level teams (such as the Patricians, Canton Bulldogs and Massillon Tigers) all having suspended operations due to the pandemic and/or World War I player shortages; this allowed Buffalo to get a leg up on its Ohio competition and sign otherwise-unemployed players, setting a course for bringing the region on par with the Ohio League and the ultimate establishment of the NFL. With that, they could have theoretically staked a claim to being the best team in the nation, especially considering how the team would perform over the next three seasons, but the Professional Football Researchers Association is dismissive of any claim that does not come from the Ohio League, and gives the mythical &quot;national title&quot; to the Dayton Triangles, who also went undefeated that year. When the New York Pro Football League reopened in 1919, the team, now reorganized into a franchise known as the Prospects, defeated the Rochester Jeffersons for the league title in a two-game Thanksgiving weekend tournament. The two teams tied the Thanksgiving Day game, but Buffalo handily defeated Rochester 20–0 the following Sunday.

Lepper teamed up with Hughitt and Patterson in early 1920 to create the Buffalo All-Americans, then quickly sold the team to Frank McNeil, a somewhat abrasive and aggressive owner who was able to get the team into the National Football League for its first season. However records indicate he may not have actually entered his team into the American Professional Football Association until 1921, the All-Americans are generally shown as the third-place team in league standings from that year (the confusion stems from a statement in the minutes from the league&#x27;s April 1921 reorganization meeting admitting an unidentified team from Buffalo; this may have instead been the Tonawanda Kardex, who joined the league in 1921, playing only one game). Patterson held on to the Prospects name and put together a lower quality team that played through 1923, including a 1922 game against the All-Americans themselves.

===The NFL===
The All-Americans had success during its first couple of APFA seasons, posting a 9–1–1 regular season record in 1920, becoming the first professional NFL team to win by margins of 20 or more points in each of its first four games, an asterisked record which was not tied until the 2007 New England Patriots&#x27; offense duplicated the feat; the asterisk is because, in the early NFL, the All-Americans played five of its 11 games against non-league opponents.

===The Buffalo–Phoenixville connection===

Unique for a professional football team, the All-Americans had a sharing agreement with the Union Club of Phoenixville, a side project managed by All-Americans player Heinie Miller. Miller would take himself and seven other All-Americans to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania to play games on Saturdays (Pennsylvania had blue laws that prevented play on Sunday), and then return to Buffalo on Sundays. This sharing agreement lasted into 1921 when Miller formed the new Union Quakers of Philadelphia, but All-Americans owner Frank McNeil put a halt to the agreement halfway through the 1921 season after the Quakers played the Canton Bulldogs and wore out the All-Americans players. Five All-Americans left the team to play for the Quakers full-time; Buffalo had the pickings of the then-defunct Detroit Tigers to replenish their roster.

===First trade in the NFL===
In 1920, the Akron Pros held the All-Americans to a scoreless tie in front of only 3,000 fans. At the game, Akron owners Frank Nied and Art Ranney agreed to sell Bob Nash to Buffalo for $300 and five per cent of the gate, in the first known player deal between NFL clubs.

===1920 Championship issue===
Along with the Decatur Staleys and Akron Pros, Buffalo claimed a share of the 1920 league title. That same season the Pros held the best record in the league, and only had to avoid losing a game. Meanwhile, Buffalo and the Staleys had to win in order to capture the APFA Championship. The Pros were able to hold the Staleys to a scoreless tie at Cub Park. However, the Pros still had to play the All-Americans who were fresh from a 7–3 win over the Canton Bulldogs at New York City&#x27;s Polo Grounds. Despite Buffalo&#x27;s confidence going into the match, the Pros also held the All-Americans to scoreless tie.

Both the All-Americans and the Staleys complained about the championship, arguing that Akron had only tied, but not defeated them. However, because league president Jim Thorpe and vice president Stan Cofall were absent from the meeting, Akron&#x27;s owner Art Ranney was presiding over the meeting. Joseph Carr, owner of the Columbus Panhandles, moved at the league&#x27;s meeting in April 1921 to give Akron the sole title and the rights to the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup. Buffalo finished in third place, with Chicago in second place. In a separate motion, Carr would be elected league president.

According to modern NFL tie-breaking rules, the 1920 Buffalo All-Americans would be co-champions. They would be tied with the Akron Pros in win percentage, wins to losses (.864), both teams beating out the Decatur Staleys, who would have a season that counted 11 wins to 2 losses (.846).

===&quot;Staley Swindle&quot;===

On November 27, 1921, the All-Americans claimed the APFA title with a record of 9–0–2. However, for reason still unknown, owner Frank McNeil agreed to play two more games. He did tell the Buffalo media that the two games were exhibitions and would have no bearing on the team&#x27;s claim to the APFA title. George Halas and the Chicago Staleys manage to capture second place in the APFA in 1921, with their only loss of the season against Buffalo. McNeil scheduled the two additional games against the Pros and Staleys back-to-back. The first game was scheduled for December 3 against the tough Pros, after which his team would take an all-night train to Chicago to play the Staleys the next day.

The All-Americans defeated the Pros, arriving in Chicago worn out and in no condition to play the Staleys, and lost. McNeil still believed his team was the APFA&#x27;s 1921 champion, and even invested in tiny gold footballs for his players to commemorate the achievement. However Halas declared that the title was Chicago&#x27;s, basing his claim on his belief that the second game of the Buffalo-Chicago series mattered more than the first. He also pointed out that the aggregate score of the two games was 16–14 in favor of the Staleys. McNeil insisted the Buffalo All-Americans were the champions, still maintaining that the last two games his team played were merely exhibitions. It didn&#x27;t matter. The league awarded the championship by a vote of the Association&#x27;s executive committee in January 1922 to the Staleys.

This episode is referred to by several sports historians and Buffalo sports fans as the &quot;Staley Swindle.&quot; McNeil eventually went to his grave trying to get the league&#x27;s decision overturned.
 In their decision, based on a generally accepted (but now obsolete) rule that if two teams play each other more than once in a season, the second game counts more than the first, the executive committee followed established tradition. Had Buffalo not played the last game, they would have had an undefeated season and won the title.

In both the 1920 and 1921 seasons, Buffalo played all of its games at home (the lone exceptions being the two 1921 matches in Chicago and one against the Detroit Tigers).

===Buffalo Bisons===
Under the leadership of player-coach Tommy Hughitt, the All-Americans, though they never equaled the success of the first two seasons, continued to post winning records in 1922 and 1923. Star running back Ockie Anderson&#x27;s knees deteriorated during the 1922 season, forcing his early retirement and beginning the team&#x27;s decline. In 1924, owner Frank McNeil sold the team back to Hughitt and Warren D. Patterson, who immediately changed the team name to &quot;Bisons&quot; (a stock name for Buffalo sports teams) and signed several players (Pete Calac, Benny Boynton and Jim Ailinger being among them) to make another run at the title. After starting the season 6–2, the team lost their last three to once again end up marginally above .500. Hughitt retired at the end of the season. After Hughitt&#x27;s retirement at the end of the 1924 season, the team struggled for the rest of its lifespan.

However, on October 1, 1925, the Bisons managed to wrestle Jim Kendrick from his contract with the Hammond Pros and signed him to play for Buffalo. In 1925 the Bisons were led by former Columbia University star and Buffalo native Walter Koppisch, who was expected to return the team to championship contention but never lived up to his billing due to a number of issues with the team surrounding him. Prior to Kendrick joining the team, the Bisons were already 0–2 on the season. Kendrick&#x27;s first game with Buffalo came on Sunday, October 4, 1925, against the Rochester Jeffersons. With Kendrick in the line-up, the Bisons tied the Jeffersons and the Akron Pros in their next two games. A week later the Bisons defeated the Columbus Tigers, 17–6. However tragedy struck the team just a few days later when, team captain Walter Koppisch was injured in a car accident and was advised to sit out a few games to allow his injuries to heal.

A week later, the Bisons were defeated by the Frankford Yellow Jackets, 12–3. However, the team was scheduled to play the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, a few days later. The game was also going to be the first game back for Koppisch. However, the Bisons, despite a strong defensive showing, could not generate their offensive potential. This game was Koppisch&#x27;s last appearance in a Buffalo uniform. The team then lost their final two games of the season to the Providence Steam Rollers (10–0) and the Chicago Cardinals (23–6).

In July 1926 it was announced that Walter Koppisch would not be returning to manage the Buffalo Bisons in the upcoming season. Meanwhile, Jim Kendrick was announced to be taking over as the team&#x27;s manager, and serving as a player-coach.

===Buffalo Rangers===
Jim Kendrick announced his &quot;Buffalo Rangers&quot; experiment, fielding an exhibition team of players from Texas and the Southwestern United States for the 1926 season. His plan was that this exhibition squad would then represent Buffalo in the NFL. Because most of the players were Texans, the team was nicknamed the &quot;Rangers&quot; in deference to the state&#x27;s legendary peacekeeping force. Along with the West Coast&#x27;s Los Angeles Buccaneers and the South&#x27;s Louisville Colonels, it was one of three teams that represented cities outside the NFL&#x27;s existing footprint.

Kendrick believed that if the players have no outside interests or anything to divert their minds from playing football, they can play better. The season&#x27;s outcome would determine if his theory was correct.

The Buffalo media alternately referred to the team as the &quot;Bison Rangers,&quot; combining the old name with the new so that fans might more easily identify with the team that was on its third name in seven years. The one-year experiment brought a 4–4–2 (.500) season. Buffalo expected Kendrick to return to field the Rangers for the 1927 season, however he signed with the New York Giants, and most of the remaining players went their separate ways, citing their dislike for Buffalo&#x27;s cold winters as the primary reason for leaving.

===Return of the Bisons and closure===

Dim Batterson, a local high school and college coach and an assistant with the team since 1925, was brought in to coach the 1927 season. After five games (all losses, all but one being a shutout), the team suspended operations and failed to finish the season. The team did not return to play in 1928, but returned in 1929 with former Oorang Indian Al Jolley as coach. Among their players that year was Jess Rodriguez, the first Hispanic-American player in the NFL (the Frankford Yellow Jackets had hired Ignacio &quot;Lou&quot; Molinet two years prior, but Molinet was a Cuban national). Much like in 1927, the Bisons failed to win a game until their final game, when in a case of cosmic irony they upset the Chicago Bears 19–7; thus, the very team that had spoiled their undefeated season in 1921 saved them from the indignity of a winless season in 1929. With the Great Depression underway, the Bisons folded, never to return again. During the season, the Bisons set an NFL record of six consecutive games without ever having a lead in regulation play. The record was tied in 2012 by the Kansas City Chiefs.

With the exception of the two teams that have direct descendants still in the NFL — the Bears and Arizona Cardinals — Buffalo was the longest-lived of the league&#x27;s original 13 teams.

At least one further game against an NFL team was played in Buffalo in the wake of the Bisons&#x27; failure: the independent Buffalo Bears narrowly lost, 8–6, to the Cleveland Indians in a 1931 contest. Buffalo would become a regular &quot;neutral site&quot; for NFL exhibitions from 1938 to 1958.

The team has no official relation to future Buffalo pro football franchises: the Buffalo Indians and Tigers of the third American Football League, the Buffalo Bisons of the AAFC, or the Buffalo Bills of today which was one of the new AFL teams (formation announced in 1959) that first played in 1960.

==Players of note==
As of 2022, no All-Americans, Bisons or Rangers player had been named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It is currently the longest existing team to have never contributed a player to the Hall, after the Jacksonville Jaguars had their first player Tony Boselli inducted in 2022.

<text>Betty Jean O&#x27;Hara (1913 in Chicago, Illinois – 1973) was a famed prostitute in Honolulu&#x27;s &quot;vice district&quot; during World War II.

==Biography==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, she was the only child of strict Catholic parents. Her father was a medical doctor. She received a good education. When O&#x27;Hara was 17, she went to a party and met another girl who was sporting expensive jewelry. The girl&#x27;s boyfriend was a pimp and introduced O&#x27;Hara to prostitution so she could also have jewellery. Initially she worked in Chicago, but later moved around the US mainland. Police records show that between 1934 and 1938 O&#x27;Hara had been arrested for prostitution three times. In June 1934, using the name &quot;Jean Burk&quot; she was arrested in Chicago. In 1937 she was banned from LaSalle County by the county court in Ottawa, Illinois. Finally she was banned from Monterey County, California, for two years and given a suspended 90 day prison sentence in April 1938.

O&#x27;Hara was probably working in a high-class brothel in San Francisco when she was recruited to work in Honolulu.

==Hawaii==
When Honolulu madams needed new prostitutes, they sent a &quot;mail order&quot; to agents, usually in San Francisco, to recruit them and arrange transport to Hawaii. The steamers were met by a detective. O&#x27;Hara and the other women were taken to the Blaisdell Hotel on Fort Street, explained the &quot;10 commandments&quot; for prostitutes and told any infraction would lead to them being removed from the islands. They were then taken to the police station, where they were fingerprinted and photographed. From there she was taken to the brothel where she was to work in Hotel Street.

After a few months she had saved a considerable sum. She decided to live outside the red-light district and rented a house near Waikiki Beach with her friend Betty. After the vice squad objected as prostitutes were not supposed to live outside the red-light district, the two women moved to the Pacific Heights area. After the vice squad again objected, O&#x27;Hara and Betty went to Kauai and worked in one of the three brothels there, which serviced mainly plantation workers. After a few months on Kauai, they worked on Maui island for a while before returning to Honolulu in 1939.

On her return to Honolulu, O&#x27;Hara was beaten up by the police and charged with assault and battery on a police office by the officer concerned. She filed a case against the policeman and the chief of police. The resulting publicity resulted in the charges being dropped. This successful standing up to the vice squad was the start of the squad losing its hold over the red-light district.

With some money behind her, O&#x27;Hara set herself up as a madam.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, people were fearful of further bombings. People were keen to sell their property and O&#x27;Hara bought up several properties which subsequently made her very wealthy. Immediately after the attack, many of the brothels were turned over to quarters for the wounded. With the brothels occupied and the authorities distracted, the prostitutes started working outside the district. O&#x27;Hara started working from the luxury Moana Hotel with two other women. Following complaints about noise, O&#x27;Hara was arrested. As the military had now taken control of the red-light district and prostitution, she was tried by a military court and sentenced to 6 months.

On her release she returned to her brothel. which was on Hotel Street. By this time the military had set a fixed price for prostitute&#x27;s services. O&#x27;Hara is credited with inventing the &quot;bull pen&quot; system where a single prostitute would work three rooms in rotation: In one room a man would be undressing, in a second room the prostitute would be having sex, and in the third room the man would be dressing. With price controls circumventing the laws of supply and demand, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s system sped up the process and allowed each prostitute to see many more &#x27;johns&#x27; every day.

In 1944 O&#x27;Hara was charged with trying to murder the husband of a fellow prostitute. The trial attracted much publicity and the jury only took 5 minutes to acquit O&#x27;Hara. After the trial she quit the sex industry.

After martial law ended in 1944, partly because of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s notoriety, the red-light district was shut down.

In 1944, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s published her memoirs as &quot;My Life as a Honolulu Prostitute&quot;. The book was later re-published under the title &quot;Honolulu Harlot&quot;. The 1956 Jane Russell film, &quot;The Revolt of Mamie Stover&quot; was based on O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s life in Honolulu (Mamie Stover was an alias O&#x27;Hara used).

O&#x27;Hara had married a &#x27;local boy&#x27; named Noriger. Years later she tried to kill him in San Francisco by ramming him against a tree with her car. O&#x27;Hara died in 1973.

<text>The Minneapolis Marines were an early professional football team that existed from 1905 until 1928. The team did not play in 1918 or 1925 to 1926 and was later resurrected from 1929 to 1930 under the Minneapolis Red Jackets name. The Marines were originally owned by the Marine Athletic Club of Minneapolis and later by Minneapolitans John Dunn and Val Ness. The Marines played their earliest games in the sandlots of Minneapolis and at Minnehaha Park. They made their first appearance at Lexington Park in 1909 and Nicollet Park in 1910. From 1912 to 1914, the team rented the North Minneapolis Athletic Association grounds at 25th Avenue North and Washington Avenue in Minneapolis, a site now overrun by Interstate 94. The Marines moved to Nicollet Park in 1915 and played there until they disbanded as the Red Jackets in 1930. The Minneapolis Marines were the first Minnesota-based team to join the National Football League, predating the Duluth Eskimos (1923) and Minnesota Vikings (1961).

==History==

===Origins===
Henry Harrison &quot;Pecky&quot; Rhoades formed the Marines baseball team in 1905, and in that same year, some players decided to form a Marines football team, too. The teams shared some players and managers until 1912, when the Marines baseball team played its final game. Rhoades left the amateur Marines baseball team in 1910 to play professional baseball.

Early on, the Marines baseball and football teams featured working-class teenagers, mostly first-generation Scandinavian-Americans from the Cedar-Riverside, Minneapolis neighborhood.

The meaning of the Marines nickname, whether it referred to the United States Marine Corps, to the merchant fleet, or to life on the water in the lakes of Minnesota, is unknown. One player from the team later recollected that the Marines had adopted the nickname from another, defunct youth baseball team in the Prospect Park neighborhood in Minneapolis. The widely held assumption is that the Marines refer to their military antecedent.

===Sandlots (1905–1909)===

From 1905 to 1909 the Marines football team played in the sandlots, first in the self-reported 115-pound weight class, and by 1909 in the 140-pound weight class, considered heavyweight at the time. The Marines claimed the championship in the 130-pound weight class in 1908. Minnehaha Park served as the premiere venue for sandlot teams in Minneapolis at this time.

The team&#x27;s main sandlot rival was the Indians, a team managed by Einar M. Irgens, a Norwegian immigrant who had been involved with independent football in Minneapolis since 1898 when he first played guard for the Lincoln Athletic Club. The Indians also featured future boxer, Labe Safro. Irgens took over management of the Marines for a season in 1909 and Safro joined the Marines as a fullback that same year, and the Marines started a new inter-city rivalry with the St. Paul Laurels.

During this sandlot period from 1905 to 1909, six players who joined the Marines would later play in the National Football League, including Dutch Gaustad, Walt Buland, Sheepy Redeen, Reuben Ursella, Charles Jonasen, and Mike Palmer. One Marines player, John Dunn, would go on to serve as team&#x27;s manager, NFL franchise owner, and NFL vice president.

The Marines would only have players on the team with no high school or college playing experience until 1912 when Harold Costello, a law student who had captained the St. Mary&#x27;s College football team in St. Mary&#x27;s, Kansas, joined the squad.

===A Professional Team===
The Minneapolis Beavers, not the Marines, were the biggest independent football attraction in Minneapolis through 1909, but that would soon change. In September 1910, the Marines selected Frank J. Hammer, an apprentice in the newspaper trade, to be the team&#x27;s new manager. Under Hammer, the team took steps toward professionalism by demanding prize purses for games and later by holding fundraisers for the team. It appears that this transition also coincided with the formation of the Marine Athletic Club, (first mentioned in 1910 in relation to the Marines baseball team), a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Social Club at 300 Cedar Avenue in Minneapolis, which oversaw athletics for member-players. In November 1910, the Marines beat the Laurels at Lexington Park and the Beavers at Nicollet Park to claim the title of Twin Cities Champions.

In 1911, for the first time, the Marines began to use the Minnesota Shift, an offensive tactic first employed by Coach Henry L. Williams at the University of Minnesota the year before. The Marines would outscore opponents 123 to 11 that season but would finish as the runner-up to the Beavers for the Minneapolis championship. In 1912, the Marines rented a home venue, the North Minneapolis Athletic Association grounds at the intersection of 25th Avenue North and Washington Ave in Minneapolis. The Marines sold tickets and operated professionally as a cooperative and they outscored opponents 293 to 37, but still they finished second to the Beavers and missed out on playing the inaugural Thanksgiving Day matchup between the best independent team in the city versus the Minnesota All-Stars, an exhibition team rostered with mostly former University of Minnesota Gophers players.

===&quot;The Pride of the Northwest&quot;===
In 1913, nearly a dozen teams competed in football in the heavyweight class in Minneapolis, and while most teams included former college players, the Marines remained a team of working men with little high school and no college experience. But then before a game against the Adams Athletic Club of Duluth, Minnesota, Hammer recruited former Gophers phenom Bobby Marshall to play for the Marines. Marshall would be the first player with major college football experience to play for the club. Hammer then hired former Gophers player Ossie Solem to coach the Marines, and he recruited a professional baseball and basketball player named Fred Chicken to play fullback for the Marines. The Marines beat the Adams team and the Beavers twice and earned the title Minnesota Champions and the opportunity to play the All-Stars on Thanksgiving Day.

The Marines would finish as the state champions from 1913 to 1917 and play the All-Stars for nine consecutive matchups, from 1913 to 1916 and from 1919 to 1923. (The All-Stars did not play in 1917 and 1918.)

After the Marines made Nicollet Park their new home venue in 1915 and started playing teams from outside Minnesota, the Marines increased their ranks by absorbing players from the Beavers. After they established a new local rivalry with the Minneapolis East Ends, the Marines absorbed players from that team, too. Three more future NFL players joined the team, including Harry Gunderson, Art Sampson, and Eddie Novak. Newspapers dubbed the Marines the Northwest Champions and also the &quot;Pride of the Northwest&quot; from 1915 to 1917.

Across seven seasons, from 1911 to 1917, the Marines would use the Minnesota Shift to outscore opponents 1,539 to 156, nearly a 10:1 ratio.

===World War I===

The United States declared war on Germany in April 1917 to during World War I, and by 1918 several key members of the Marines football team had enlisted, which depleted the team&#x27;s roster. John Dunn, who had taken over management of the Marines in 1915, joined the Minnesota National Guard, but still he attempted to field a team. However, the flu pandemic prevented the Marines from taking the field. Meanwhile, a few members of the Marines played on service teams.

===Post-war Marines===
After the war, several Marines players who had played as ringers for the Rock Island Independents and the Davenport Athletics in 1917 chose to play for Rock Island, instead. The men who departed the Marines for the Independents in 1919 included Reuben Ursella, Walt Buland, Fred Chicken, Dewey Lyle, Bobby Marshall, and Eddie Novak. In 1920, two more Marines players, Harry Gunderson and Frank Jordan, left to play for Rock Island. Marines manager John Dunn backfilled the team with more former East Ends players and also former members of the Arrows, a team sponsored by the Citizens Club in Minneapolis. Six new future NFL players joined the team, including Rudy Tersch, Larry &quot;Sox&quot; Erickson, John Norbeck, Oscar &quot;Bully&quot; Christianson, Ainer Cleve, Harold D. Hanson, and Frank Jordan. The Marines enjoyed a 10–2–4 overall record from 1919 to 1920 on schedules that included games against the Hammond All-Stars in 1919 and the Decatur Staleys in 1920.

===The Marines in the NFL===

In 1920, John Dunn decided to stop playing and instead focus on managing the team, and in 1921, he sought to join a new western professional league based in Omaha, Nebraska. When that league never materialized, Dunn and a business partner, Val Ness, (who had played for the Marines in 1919), secured a franchise for the team in the National Football League. Dunn then recruited Reuben Ursella to play and coach the team, and he beefed up the Marines backfield by recruiting two former Gophers players Pete Regnier and Ben Dvorak. The Marines won the first NFL game they ever played at Nicollet Park when they beat the Columbus Panhandles 28–0, but overall from 1921 to 1924, the Marines won only four games and finished 4–18–2 in the NFL (15–21–2 overall including non-NFL opponents). Other coaches during this period included Russell Tollefson, who had coached the Marines in 1916, and former Gophers player Gus Ekberg as Tollefson&#x27;s assistant. Harry Mehre played and coached in 1923, and Joe Brandy coached in 1924.

John Dunn was elected vice president of the National Football League in 1922, but after posting an 0–6 record in 1924, Dunn folded the team, yet he retained the franchise and his position as vice president. He would serve in that role through the 1928 NFL season.

===The Marines in limbo===
By 1924, interest in pro football in Minneapolis had declined significantly, in no small part because the University of Minnesota Gophers football team had opened a new half-a-million-dollar, horseshoe-shaped venue dubbed Memorial Stadium that seated up to 52,000 fans. On average, the Gophers drew over 23,000 fans per game that first season in the new venue, and the Marines could not compete for fan interest. As a result, John Dunn tried to drum up support to move the team to Rochester, Minnesota, in 1925, but that effort failed.

In 1926, John Dunn and Val Ness teamed up with boxing promoter Jack Reddy in an effort to revive the NFL franchise under a new name, the Twin City Lumberjacks. Dunn signed several players for the team, including former Gophers captain Carl L. Lidberg and three former College of St. Thomas players, Chuck Reichow, Jack Murray, and Walt Kiesling. Former Marines coach Joe Brandy would coach the new team, and the effort depended on Brandy financially investing in the team. When the group failed to pay the NFL franchise fee for the 1926 season, reportedly because Brandy pulled out of the deal, the effort fell apart.

===An exhibition team===
Still inactive as an NFL franchise, the Marines returned to the field to play exhibition games in 1927 and 1928. The Marines hosted Red Grange and his New York Yankees NFL franchise in 1927, and in 1928, John Dunn revived the Marines as a vehicle to feature former Gophers standout Herb Joesting who, despite finishing his college career setting new school rushing records of 1,850 career yards and 23 touchdowns, received disappointing offers from professional football teams. Joesting and the Marines played games against the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears.

===The Red Jackets===

In late May 1928, Herb Joesting announced he would captain and manage an entrant in the NFL with former Gophers player Ken Haycraft as his assistant. He promised the team would be an &quot;all-college aggregation,&quot; unlike previous attempts to field an NFL team in Minneapolis. Behind the scenes, Dunn and Ness paid the NFL franchise fee for 1928 to revive the team as the Minneapolis Red Jackets, a name that perhaps continued the military theme that Dunn had adopted, first with the Marines, a name he inherited, and later with the 151st Field Artillery, the name for his minor league football team and practice squad. It is conceivable that the name “Red Jackets” may have been inspired by the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment that fought in the American Civil War and wore red shirts. As a football team, the Red Jackets wore red helmets, red jerseys, red pants, and red socks. On the sideline, the Red Jackets wore hooded coats in the same color.

Outside of Joesting, the most accoladed player to join the Red Jackets was Hal Erickson, who had played in two Rose Bowl games and later for the Milwaukee Badgers and Chicago Cardinals. Meanwhile, Reuben Ursella rejoined the team, in part to signify continuity with the original Marines team.

The Red Jackets practiced at the Parade Grounds, the future home of Parade Stadium, and at some point during the season, Joesting sought out Sigmund Harris, who had worked as an assistant coach at the University of Minnesota for 22 years, to assist with coaching the Red Jackets.

The Red Jackets finished 1–9 in the NFL in 1929 (3–9 including non-NFL games), and so for 1930, John Dunn recruited former Gophers captain George Gibson, who had worked as an assistant for coach Clarence Spears at the University of Minnesota, to coach and play for the Red Jackets. Gibson traveled to California where he recruited former University of Southern California linemen Nate Barrager, John Ward, and Tony Steponovich to play for the Red Jackets. Meanwhile, Dunn attempted to recruit former Gophers player Bronko Nagurski to play for the home team, but Nagurski found better offers elsewhere and signed with the Chicago Bears.

Dunn and Ness sold season tickets for their team for the first time in 1930, and while the Red Jackets&#x27; game versus Nagurski and the Bears drew a crowd, the Red Jackets only won one game in 1930 against the Portsmouth Spartans. After a loss to the Chicago Bears at Wrigley Field on November 2, and after the Frankford Yellow Jackets lost to the Chicago Cardinals at Comiskey Park that same day, Dunn sold most of his franchise&#x27;s player contracts to Frankford and sold three player contracts to the Green Bay Packers. It&#x27;s not clear whether Dunn and Ness had sold the franchise per se to Frankford, because later reports indicated they still had a stake in the league. Either way, the Frankford Athletic Association would oversee finishing the schedule for both the Yellow Jackets and the Red Jackets, and for the remainder of the 1930 season, the manager and coaches of Frankford A. A. would use players from both rosters to play in Yellow Jackets and Red Jackets games. A total of twenty players including ten original Red Jackets and ten original Yellow Jackets jumped back-and-forth between both teams, and in the case of the original Red Jackets, three players, Gibson, Barrager, and Joesting, appeared in every single Red Jackets and Yellow Jackets game after November 2. The Red Jackets finished the season with a 1–7–1 NFL record (3–7–1 including non-NFL games).

Minneapolis would not hold another NFL franchise for the next three decades, before the Minnesota Vikings debuted in 1961.

==First pro football minor league team and practice squad==
In 1922, while the Marines struggled in the NFL, John Dunn and Val Ness fielded a second team, the semi-professional 151st Field Artillery, the “soldiers,” which played at Nicollet Park during Marines away games. The team played in a new Twin City football league with five other semi-professional teams. The 151st Field Artillery would serve as a practice squad for the Marines. The team&#x27;s name paid homage the 151st Field Artillery Regiment from Minnesota, which had fought valiantly in the 42nd “Rainbow” Infantry Division during World War I. The 151st Field Artillery played the pre-NFL Duluth Kelleys at Athletic Park in Duluth and then ended its season in late October after a handful of games.

==First pro football training camp==
By 1927, the Dunn family had started spending their summers at Clef Camp, a resort on Lake Pokegama southwest of Grand Rapids, Minnesota. When John Dunn and Val Ness decided to revive their NFL franchise as the Minneapolis Red Jackets, Dunn hit on the idea of using Clef Camp as a training camp for the Red Jackets players. The team assembled in Minneapolis in late summer and traveled together to camp where they engaged in two-a-day practices at 10:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. The two-week training camp included a training table and conditioning that included swimming and running and daily practices at Grand Rapids High School.

<text>Detroit had four early teams in the National Football League before the Detroit Lions. The Heralds played in 1920, and had played as an independent as far back as 1905. The Tigers, a continuation of the Heralds, played in 1921, folding midseason and sending their players to the Buffalo All-Americans. The Panthers competed from 1925 to 1926 and the Wolverines in 1928.

==Team histories==
===Detroit Heralds/Tigers===
In 1905, several University of Detroit football players, led by Bill Marshall, organized the Heralds as an amateur team after the university did not field a squad. While the university&#x27;s football team resumed play in 1906, the Heralds continued to play as an amateur team. In 1911, the team dropped its amateur status and became semi-professional. In 1916, several out-of-town players were brought in to replace some of the older players, several of whom had been with the Heralds since 1905.

Despite not being based in Ohio, the Heralds played many of their games against teams in the Ohio League. In 1917, the team recorded an 8–2 record, their only losses coming at the hands of the Ohio League champion Canton Bulldogs and a military team from Battle Creek. The Heralds were a rarity in 1918; while most teams either stopped play or reduced their schedules to only local teams because of World War I and the flu pandemic, the Heralds continued to play a full schedule and even travel to other cities, accruing a 6–2 record with both losses coming to the Ohio League champion Dayton Triangles. In 1919, as the suspended teams resumed play and travel restrictions eased significantly, the Heralds went 1–4–2, including losses to the Bulldogs and the Massillon Tigers.

In 1920, the American Professional Football Association, predecessor to the National Football League, was established. While the Heralds did not officially join the association, they are listed in league standings for the season. Overall, the Heralds went 2–3–3.

The Heralds were reorganized into the Detroit Tigers, after the city&#x27;s Major League Baseball team, for the 1921 season. However, after a tie and a win in their first two games, the Tigers lost the next five. Several players complained about not getting paid and left the team during the season. As a result, the Tigers officially folded in mid-November. Its remaining players were given to the Buffalo All-Americans.

===Detroit Panthers===
In 1925, Detroit fielded its second NFL franchise, the Detroit Panthers. The team was organized by future Hall of Famer, Jimmy Conzelman. Conzelman was a quarterback who had recently played with the Decatur Staleys, Rock Island Independents and the Milwaukee Badgers. Conzelman served as the team&#x27;s owner, coach, and starting quarterback. The Panthers started the season 8–1. However, a 6–3 upset loss to the Independents on Thanksgiving Day knocked them out of first place and they ended the season in third with a 8–2–2 record.

The Panthers hoped to build on their 1925 season, but they opened the 1926 season with an 0–3 record. After rallying to a 4–0–2 record in their next six games, they lost their last three. Conzelman gave up the franchise and joined the Providence Steam Rollers as player-coach.

===Detroit Wolverines===

Following the 1927 season, the Cleveland Bulldogs were sold to a group of investors, who moved the team to Detroit. Coached by LeRoy Andrews, the team was renamed the Detroit Wolverines. They were named after quarterback Benny Friedman&#x27;s alma mater, the Michigan Wolverines. The Wolverines finished their 1928 season in third place with a 7–2–1 record, losing only to the Providence Steam Rollers and the Frankford Yellow Jackets, the NFL&#x27;s first and second place teams.

During the offseason, Tim Mara, the owner of the New York Giants, was interested in acquiring Friedman. Rather than simply trade for Friedman, Mara bought the entire Wolverines franchise and promptly deactivated it, delivering Friedman and other star Wolverines players to New York. The NFL would not return to the Motor City for six years, until the Portsmouth Spartans became the Detroit Lions in 1934.

==Thanksgiving Day games==
While the Lions are well known for playing on Thanksgiving Day, the other Detroit teams had a history of playing on Thanksgiving Day as well:
*1917 Heralds vs. Canton Bulldogs (lost 7–0)
*1920 Heralds at Dayton Triangles (lost 28–0)
*1921 Tigers, merged with the Buffalo All-Americans, at Chicago Staleys (won 7–6)
*1925 Panthers vs. Rock Island Independents (lost 6–3)
*1926 Panthers vs. Los Angeles Buccaneers (lost 9–6)
*1928 Wolverines vs. Dayton Triangles (won 33–0)

<doc id="239710" wikidata="Q3478511" url="?curid=239710" title="Washington Senators (NFL)">
<text>Washington Senators, also referred to as the Washington Pros or Washington Presidents, was a professional football club from Washington, D.C. The team played for one season in the American Professional Football Association (now the National Football League) during the 1921 season. Afterward, it continued to operate as an independent football club until 1941. The Senators played and practiced at American League Park.

==Formation==
Washington, D.C. was a considerable distance from most professional football activity in the 1910s and 1920s, with the closest circuit of professional teams of note located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At least one pre-NFL team from the city, the Washington Vigilants, was considered at or near par to the top teams in the country, consistently beating its local peers and playing a close loss to the Youngstown Patricians, an undefeated team in the Ohio League, then considered the premier U.S. pro circuit, in 1915. The Vigilants disbanded in 1916.

The Senators were formed specifically for the 1921 APFA season. Officials from the Washington Professional Football Club met at the Arlington Hotel on May 19, 1921, to finalize plans for the team, then referred to as the Washington Pros. Tim Jordan was appointed the team&#x27;s business manager, and the squad was coached by former Georgetown star Jack Hegarty. The Senators would play a full 11-game schedule, however only four of those games would be against other APFA squads. The team featured Benny Boynton who would be involved in all three Senator touchdowns that were scored in APFA contests, throwing for two and running in the third.

==1921 season==

===First non-league opponents===
The Senators began their 1921 campaign with a 33–0 win over the Wilmington Collegians. Led by quarterback Bullets Watson, the victory featured touchdowns by Jack Sullivan, Watson and Dutch Leighty. The team&#x27;s next opponent was the Holmesburg Athletic Club which was based out of Holmesburg, Pennsylvania, and were made up of former college stars from Penn State, Penn, Cornell, Swarthmore College, Carlisle Indian School and Lafayette College. The Senators&#x27; third game was against a team from Norfolk, after a semi-pro team from Akron was unable to play due to having a large number of injured players.

===Syracuse Pros===
After playing against three non-APFA opponents, the Senators defeated the Syracuse Pros 20–7 at home. It is unclear however if the Pros were ever a part of the APFA. The team acknowledged that they were members of the league, however there is no record available through the APFA or NFL documenting the team&#x27;s membership. Therefore, the Pros are not counted in many record books as being an APFA or NFL franchise.

===Harry Courtney===
Harry Courtney, a left-handed pitcher for the Washington Senators baseball club, signed with the football Senators for their November 20 game against a team from Clarksburg, West Virginia. However Clark Griffith, the owner of the baseball Senators, found out about his Courtney moonlighting as a football player. Griffith ordered Courtney to stop playing football or risk finding himself without a job in baseball. Indeed, Courtney gave up his football career and continued to focus only on baseball.

===APFA debut===
The Senators&#x27; APFA debut occurred on November 27, 1921, when they faced the Canton Bulldogs. Canton had a reputation was one of the nation&#x27;s premier clubs. The game received relatively large amounts of exposure in the local papers. Many observers saw this as Washington&#x27;s big chance to show that it was a force to be taken seriously nationally. While, Canton was known for its speed, Washington came into the game with a weight advantage. Washington&#x27;s average offensive lineman tipped the scales at 189 pounds while Canton&#x27;s stood at 185 pounds, while the backs registered at 171 pounds to the Bulldogs&#x27; 168 pounds. To help his team win the game, Senators head coach Jack Hegerty signed three former Canton players in an effort to tip the odds. Former Georgia Tech star Joe Guyon, Johnny Gilroy and Pete Calac. The plan was to have the men come off the bench and provide support to the already sturdy starting eleven.

With tickets priced one dollar, approximately 4,000 showed up to American League Field to see the game. However Canton shutout Washington, 15–0.

===Rochester forfeit controversy===
Washington was originally scheduled to play the Pittsburgh Collegians after their loss to Canton, however the plans for the game fell apart. When that happened, Tim Jordan substituted the Collegians for the Rochester Jeffersons.

On December 5, 1921, a game was scheduled between the Jeffersons and the Senators. Due to the field being covered with snow, Rochester&#x27;s manager Leo Lyons refused to play the game rather than risk injury to his players. It has been said by some fans and historians that Lyons forfeited the game because of snowy conditions. However, according to Lyons, the Senators had a poor fan turnout due to a snowstorm and said they would only pay the Jefferson team roughly $200. That amount would not allow for the team to be paid to play the game, or travel expenses for the trip back to Rochester. The game had an NFL guarantee that the Jeffersons must be paid $800 for the game regardless of anything. Lyons refused to play the game because of Washington not paying the $800 that was in the game contract.

The contract between the two teams stated that if there was a dispute as to the condition of the field, the decision would belong to the home team. Washington was willing to play the game, not wanting to disappoint the 400 or so fans that had showed up. After forty minutes of arguing, the game was awarded to Washington, by the score of 1–0. Later, NFL commissioner Joseph Carr ruled in favor of Lyons and the Jeffs.

Meanwhile, the Senators were required to pay an $800 guaranteed fee to the Jeffersons for showing up regardless of whether the contest happened or not. Washington never paid, as it decided to immediately leave the APFA after the season anyway. As a result of the fine remaining unpaid, the NFL did record the game as a victory, however the Elias Sports Bureau has not recognized this game as a forfeit and official NFL standings also say it was not a forfeit.

===First win and rematch with Canton===
The Senators recorded their first APFA victory on December 11 against the Cleveland Indians, 7–0, before a reported 5,000 spectators.

On December 18, 1921, Tim Jordan landed a rematch with the Canton Bulldogs, and was determined to put up a better fight. Washington reached an agreement with Penn State All-American quarterback Glenn Killinger to play for the Senators, hoping that one of the premier collegiate players would be enough to tip the scales. However at the last moment, Killinger not only pulled out of his deal with the Senators, but also signed with the Bulldogs.

Washington found themselves in an early 14–0 deficit, after a long Killinger pass caught the Senators by surprise, and a poor Boynton punt gave Canton an easy chance to push in their second touchdown. However Washington evened the score at 14 after two long drives that ended with a Johnnie Hudson touchdown reception and a Boynton touchdown run. The game remained tied late into the game, with the Senators holding possession with just a few minutes left in the game. But Washington&#x27;s Gene Vidal fumbled the ball, and Canton was able to march down the field to take the lead. After the kickoff, the Bulldogs intercepted a Washington pass and returned it for the final touchdown.

Before around 6,000 fans, the Senators again fell to the Bulldogs 28–14.

However, the Senators would play one more game, while still members of the AFPA. On December 26, 1921, the Senators were scheduled to play a team of All-Stars at American League Park. The results of the game are unknown. The Senators finished the game with a 1–2–0 AFPA record.


==1922==
The Senators would leave the AFPA following the 1921 season. Only three of the Senators (Benny Boynton, Pete Calac and Joe Guyon) would play in the NFL following the 1921 season.

Led by Bullets Watson on the field and Tim Jordan off (who appears to have doubled as coach), the club did continue to function in the 1922 season as the Washington Football Club or the Washington Pros.

===Games===

*Home Opener: Akron Indians 6, Pros 0
*November 5; Pros at Baltimore

If this game was in fact played, Washington came out with a victory or tie.

*November 12; Toledo Maroons 16, Pros 0 at American League Park

The game featured the return of Bennie Boynton, who left the Pros to play with Toledo. For this game, Boynton switched sides and played with the Pros. Akron recorded two touchdowns and safety to remain unbeaten. The Pros relied heavily on Boynton, but could no recover from an early blocked drop-kick, which was run back for the first Arkon score.

*November 19; Pros vs. Rochester at American League Park
*November 26; no game
*Pros vs. Chester Shipbuilding (replacement for Pennsylvania Quakers)
*Pros vs. Canton Bulldogs

The game against Canton came after nearly a month-long layoff, they hosted the APFA champion, and their old nemesis, the Canton Bulldogs. Canton was determined to keep their unbeaten record unblemished, and started their regular unit against the Washingtonians.

<text>Acacius of Constantinople (Greek: Ἀκάκιος; died 26 November 489) served as the patriarch of Constantinople from 472 to 489. He was practically the first prelate in the East and was renowned for his ambitious participation in the Chalcedonian controversy. His controversial attempts at healing the theological divisions led to the Acacian schism and his being condemned by the Chalcedonian churches. He is revered as a saint in Oriental Orthodoxy.

Acacius advised the Byzantine emperor Zeno to issue the Henotikon Edict in 482, which condemned Nestorius of Constantinople and Eutyches, accepted the Twelve Chapters of Cyril of Alexandria and ignored the Chalcedonian Definition. Though the Henotikon aimed to resolve the conflict surrounding the Chalcedon council&#x27;s orthodoxy, it ultimately failed. Pope Felix III considered Acacius&#x27; slighting of Chalcedon and his predecessor Pope Leo I to be an affront to the prestige of his Holy See. Acacius was condemned and deposed by Pope Felix III, an action which was met with contempt by Acacius and resulted in a schism between the two sees, which continued after Acacius&#x27;s death. The schism extended throughout the tumultuous reign of the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus and was only resolved by emperor Justin I under Pope Hormisdas in 519.

The Coptic Orthodox Church celebrates The Departure of St. Acacius, Patriarch of Constantinople on the 30th of the Coptic month of Hathor.

== Early life and episcopate ==
Acacius first appearers in authentic history as the &quot;orphanotrophos&quot;, or an official entrusted with the care of the orphans, in the Church of Constantinople, which he administered with conspicuous success. Suda describes him as magnificent, generous, suave, noble, courtly, and showy.

The Roman emperor Leo I took notice of his abilities and, using the skills of an accomplished courtier, gained considerable influence over him, leading to his succession as Patriarch on the death of Gennadius of Constantinople in 471. The initial five to six years of his episcopate were unremarkable. However, he soon became embroiled in controversies which lasted throughout his patriarchate, culminating in a thirty-five-year (484–519) schism between the East and West churches.

He sought, first, to restore the unity of the Church, which had been divided by the divisions caused by the Eutychian debates; and, secondly, to increase the authority of his see by asserting its independence from Rome and extending its influence over Alexandria and Antioch. In terms of his actions, he seems to have behaved more like a statesman than a theologian.

== Chalcedonian controversy ==
=== Allied opposition against Basilicus and Timothy II of Alexandria ===
Acacius gained enthusiastic popular support and praise from Pope Simplicius due to his opposition to the usurped Roman emperor Basiliscus. Alongside the stylite monk, Daniel the Stylite, he led the opposition against the usurped emperor Basiliscus. Timothy II of Alexandria, the non-Chalcedonian patriarch of Alexandria under the protection of emperor Basiliscus since 476, had already induced Basiliscus to issue an encyclical or imperial proclamation (&quot;egkyklios&quot;) condemning the teaching of the Council of Chalcedon. Acacius initially hesitated to add his name to the list of Asiatic bishops who had previously signed the encyclical. However, he reconsidered this position and became actively involved in the debate after receiving a letter from Pope Simplicius. The pope had been alerted to Acacius&#x27; uncertain stance by the vigilant monastic party. This sudden change of allegiance improved his reputation among the public and gained him favour with the Chalcedonian faction, especially among the different monastic groups in the East, due to his overt commitment to sound doctrine. He even received a letter of endorsement from Pope Simplicius.

The main reason for Acacius&#x27; sudden surge in popularity was his skillful ability to lead the movement which Daniel the Stylite was both the leader and inspiration of. The uproar was undoubtedly spontaneous among the monastic promoters and the general public who genuinely abhorred Eutychian views on the Incarnation. However, it remains uncertain whether Acacius, who was now in opposition to the Chalcedonians, or later, in his attempts at compromise, was anything more complex than a politician trying to achieve his own personal ends. He lacked a consistent understanding of theological principles and had a gambler&#x27;s mindset, playing solely for influence. Ultimately, Basiliscus was defeated.

Basiliscus retracted his offensive decree through a counter-proclamation, but his submission did not save him. Subsequently, the emperor Zeno, who was in exile until Acacius&#x27; opposition, regained the throne he had lost; and Basiliscus, after abject and futile concessions to the ecclesiastical power, was handed over to him (as tradition has it) by Acacius, having taken refuge in his church in 477. At this point, the relations between Zeno, Acacius and Simplicius seem to have been friendly. They agreed on the need to take vigorous measures to confirm the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon, and for a time they acted in unison.

=== Disputes over Peter III of Alexandria and John Talaia ===
In 479, Acacius consecrated the Patriarch of Antioch, thus exceeding the proper limits of his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, Pope Simplicius accepted the appointment, citing necessity.

Trouble erupted when the Non-Chalcedonian party of Alexandria tried to install Peter III of Alexandria as patriarch, instead of John Talaia, in 482. Simplicus objected to Peter III of Alexandria&#x27;s appointment due to his affiliation with the Non-Chalcedonian party of Alexandria and declared his support for John Talaia.

Both candidates had notable drawbacks. Peter III had been a Non-Chalcedonian, and Talaia was bound by a solemn promise to the Emperor not to seek or (it would seem) accept the Patriarchate. Talaia immediately sought and obtained the support of Simplicius, and offended Acacius. Peter III assured Acacius that, if confirmed in his post, he would be able to heal the divisions caused by the dispute.

This occasion gave Acacius his long-awaited opportunity to claim honour and jurisdiction over the whole of the East, freeing the bishops of the capital from responsibility to the sees of Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem and the Roman Pontiff. Acacius, having fully won over Zeno, advised the emperor to support Peter III of Alexandria, despite Simplicius&#x27; strong opposition. Acacius then sent envoys to discuss the terms of reunion for all the churches of the East.

=== Henotikon Edict and the Acacian Schism ===
Shortly after, Acacius prepared a document or set of articles, which was at once a creed and an instrument of reunion, as his way of claiming jurisdiction over the whole of the East. This document, known to theologians as the Henotikon, was initially aimed at the opposing factions in Egypt, and was a call for reunion the grounds of restraint and compromise.

The Henotikon edict of 482 affirmed the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (i.e. the Nicene Creed as completed at Constantinople) as the common, definitive and unified symbol or expression of faith. All other symbola or mathemata were rejected; Eutyches and Nestorius were unequivocally condemned in an anathema, while the Twelve Chapters of Cyril of Alexandria were accepted. The teachings of Chalcedon were not repudiated, but rather simply ignored; Jesus Christ was described as the &quot;only-begotten Son of God ... one and not two&quot;, and there was no explicit reference to the two natures.

Peter III of Alexandria accepted the Henotikon and was confirmed in his position. John Talaia refused to accept it and withdrew to Rome, where his support was taken up with great vigour by letters from Pope Simplicius urging Acacius to control the spread of heresy elsewhere and in Alexandria. The letters were in vain, and Simplicius died soon afterwards.

His successor, Pope Felix III, zealously championed Talaia&#x27;s cause and sent two bishops, Vitalis and Misenus, to Constantinople with letters to Zeno and Acacius, demanding that the latter return to Rome to answer the charges brought against him by Talaia (Felix, Epp. 1, 2). The mission completely failed. Vitalis and Misenus were persuaded to publicly communicate (i.e. receive Holy Communion) with Acacius and the representatives of Peter III. In shame, they returned to Italy in 484.

Upon their arrival in Rome, a synod convened and vehemently denounced their actions. They were subsequently deposed and excommunicated. Furthermore, a new anathema was issued against Peter III, and Acacius was irrevocably excommunicated for his association with Pierre III, for exceeding the limits of his jurisdiction, and for refusing to answer the charges of Talaia at Rome; but no direct heretical opinion was proved or urged against him. Acacius was condemned by Pope Felix for committing a sin against the Holy Spirit and apostolic authority (&quot;Habe ergo cum his ... portionem S. Spiritus judicio et apostolica auctoritate damnatus&quot;). He was subsequently subjected to perpetual excommunication (&quot;nunquamque anathematis vinculis exuendus&quot;).

Felix sent the sentence to Acacius, and at the same time wrote to Zeno and to the Church of Constantinople, ordering everyone to separate from the deposed Patriarch on pain of excommunication. Meanwhile, an additional envoy, Tutus, was appointed to personally deliver the decree of double excommunication to Acacius. Acacius declined to accept the documents presented by Tutus and demonstrated his defiance of the authority of the Roman See and the Synod that had condemned him by erasing Pope Felix&#x27;s name from the diptychs. Despite the threats from Felix, there were hardly any practical consequences, as the majority of Eastern Christians continued to remain in communion with Acacius.

Talaia agreed to become Bishop of Nola, effectively conceding defeat; meanwhile, Zeno and Acacius actively pursued the widespread adoption of the Henotikon throughout the East. Some (probably biased) sources say that Acacius, together with Zeno, began a brutal policy of violence and persecution, directed mainly against his old opponents, the monks, in order to achieve the general acceptance of the Henotikon. The condemnation of Acacius made in the name of the Pope, was repeated in the name of the Council of Chalcedon, and the schism was complete in 485. Acacius disregarded the sentence to the day of his death in 489, which was followed by those of Mongus in 490 and Zeno in 491.

His successor, Fravitta of Constantinople, entered into negotiations with Felix during a very brief patriarchate, but to no avail. The policy of Acacius failed when he could no longer implement it. In a short span of years, all his efforts were undone. The Henotikon was unsuccessful in reestablishing unity in the East, and in 519, Byzantine emperor Justin I deferred to Pope Hormisdas, and the condemnation of Acacius was recognised by the Church of Constantinople.

<text>The Pottsville Maroons were an American football team based in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, in the northeastern part of the state. Founded in 1920, they played in the National Football League (NFL) from 1925 to 1928. In 1929 they relocated to Boston, where they played one season as the Boston Bulldogs.

The team was founded as the Pottsville Eleven, an independent team playing in the local eastern Pennsylvania circuit. Home games were played at Minersville Park, a high school stadium in nearby Minersville. They joined the local Anthracite League in 1924, the same year they adopted the &quot;Maroons&quot; nickname, and won the league title. The next season they joined the NFL under owner John G. Streigel. Though dominant on the field, a controversial suspension cost them the 1925 NFL Championship. They were reinstated the following year, but after two successive losing seasons in 1927 and 1928, Streigel sold the Maroons to a group in Boston, where they played one season before folding.

1925 was their best season. The 1928 roster included three future Pro Football Hall of Fame members – Johnny &quot;Blood&quot; McNally, Walt Kiesling, and coach Wilbur &quot;Pete&quot; Henry – but posted the worst record in franchise history. Writer John O&#x27;Hara, who would go on to become a world-famous novelist with &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot;, covered the team for the local newspaper, the &quot;Pottsville Republican&quot;.

==History==

===Origins===
Like other coal towns in eastern Pennsylvania, Pottsville had been fielding football teams from at least the 1910s. The team that became the Maroons was established in 1920 as the Pottsville Eleven, and had a roster mostly made up of firemen from the Yorkville Hose Company. The team was initially unaffiliated with any league, playing on the independent circuit against other teams from the coal mining towns of eastern Pennsylvania. In 1922 the team attracted the sponsorship of area businessmen Harold Kingsbury, Irvin Heinz and Frank Schoeneman, who brought in talented professional players such as Carl Beck, Benny Boynton and Stan Cofall. Still, the team maintained a strong local presence by recruiting many Pottsville natives to its roster. The result was a team with consistent winning records and strong crowds.

===Anthracite League===
In 1924 local surgeon John G. &quot;Doc&quot; Striegel purchased the Pottsville Eleven for $1,500. That year teams in the local circuit decided to form a league, which became known as the Anthracite League. This was also the year the team adopted the Maroons name; according to legend, the team placed an order for new football jerseys with local sporting goods supplier Joe Zacko, telling him that the color was not important. Zacko sent them twenty-five maroon jerseys, giving birth to the name.

During the 1924 Anthracite League season, the Maroons added three members of the NFL&#x27;s 1923 Canton Bulldogs championship team to their roster. These players were Larry Conover, Harry Robb and future Hall of Fame inductee Wilbur &quot;Pete&quot; Henry. NFL President Joseph Carr was not pleased to see stars like Henry deserting the league to play for an independent coal region team, but there was little he could do about it unless Pottsville joined the league. A suit filed by Henry&#x27;s former NFL team was thrown out on a technicality by a Pennsylvania judge. The Maroons then posted a 6–0–1 record against Anthracite League teams and clinched the league title that November with a victory over Coaldale.

Immediately after winning the Anthracite League title, the Maroons issued challenges to both the NFL champion Cleveland Bulldogs and the Frankford Yellow Jackets, who claimed the Eastern professional championship. When neither team accepted, Striegel scheduled a game with the NFL&#x27;s Rochester Jeffersons, who had not beaten an NFL opponent since 1921. These two teams met in a season finale on the last Sunday of November. Rochester managed to defeat Pottsville 10–7, giving the Maroons their only loss of the season. However Pottsville ended its 1924 season with an overall record of 12–1–1, scoring 288 points and allowing only 17 while capturing the Anthracite League title.

==NFL==
The Anthracite League collapsed after the season, but Striegel and the Maroons were undeterred. They applied for, and received, a franchise in the NFL. This was somewhat unusual, as the team&#x27;s Minersville Park was a relatively small high school field; the league administration may have been attracted by the favorable logistics of a second team near the Frankford Yellow Jackets in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania&#x27;s blue laws, which prohibited football on Sundays in Philadelphia, were simply not followed in Pottsville, allowing traveling teams to play the Yellowjackets on a Saturday and then head to Pottsville on Sunday.

Since many Maroons players moved back to their NFL teams in 1925, the Maroons recruited several talented players to replace them. These included former Army great Walter French and Jack Ernst, a quarterback from Lafayette College. Another Army recruit, end Eddie Doyle, later served in World War II and was the first American killed in the landings in North Africa. Topping this collection of stars was Charlie Berry, possibly the best athlete on the team; after a spectacular athletic career at Lafayette College, he signed both pro baseball and pro football contracts. However, this strong talent was expensive, and difficult to make up even with sellout crowds at little Minersville Park.
During this time the Maroons insisted that their players live in the Pottsville area. During the 1920s most players had to travel great distances from their homes and only joined their teams on game day. By having the players live in Pottsville, coach and former Colgate University assistant Dick Rauch instituted regular practices for his players. This helped the Maroons to a 28–0 win over the Buffalo Bisons in their first NFL game. When not practicing, the Maroons spent their days hanging around the fire house, drinking Yuengling, playing cards and tossing footballs in the street. The Maroons then jumped out to a 9–1–1 record. However some believe that having visiting teams play Frankford the day before the Maroons benefited the team. Pottsville was 5–1–0 in their six games against teams that played the Yellow Jackets the previous day. On the first snap of the game against the Chicago Bears, the Pottsville players knocked football legend Red Grange out cold. Grange soon recovered from the hit, only to be knocked out again. Immediately Grange said &quot;The hell with (the $500 owed to him for the one game), it ain&#x27;t worth it.&quot; He then proceeded to walk off the field. The team&#x27;s only loss in 1925 came from a 20–0 upset to the Yellow Jackets. However, in the second meeting of the two teams, the Maroons beat Frankford 49–0.

By this point in the season, Pottsville and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) were the two top teams in the league, having comparable records. At the time, the NFL Championship went to the team with the best record against other NFL teams. As such, the match-up between the two was of great importance. The Maroons met the Cardinals in late November near the end of the season for a game at Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park, under snowy conditions. The Maroons won the game 21–7, thereby putting them ahead of the Cardinals in the championship race.

===1925 NFL Championship controversy===

With the 1925 season near its end, the Maroons had the best record and had defeated the rival Cardinals, essentially ensuring the NFL championship. Before the season ended, however, the Maroons were suspended by NFL commissioner Joseph Carr, thus denying them the championship title. This has been the subject of controversy ever since.

Earlier in the year, the Frankford Yellow Jackets had scheduled an exhibition game between a team of former University of Notre Dame stars and the best NFL team in the east. As the NFL&#x27;s dominant eastern team at the time, they believed they themselves would get to play the potentially lucrative match against the &quot;Notre Dame All-Stars&quot;. However, when Pottsville later pulled ahead in the standings, they won the right to play the All-Stars. As Pottsville&#x27;s Minersville Park was a high school stadium with a capacity of only around 6,000, team owner John Streigel booked the much larger Shibe Park in Philadelphia for the big game. Philadelphia, though, was within the Yellow Jackets&#x27; designated territory, and Frankford complained to the league. Commissioner Carr warned Streigel several times that Pottsville&#x27;s franchise would be suspended if they played in Philadelphia.

Not wanting to give up on a potential financial windfall for his team, Streigel went ahead with the game. He would later claim he had received verbal permission from the NFL by telephone, though he gave inconsistent responses as to which official he had spoken to. The Maroons won the game 9–7, which was considered a major win for professional football, but the match only attracted about 8,000 fans, a major financial disappointment. As threatened, Carr suspended Pottsville and removed them from the NFL, preventing them from finishing their schedule.
Meanwhile, Chicago Cardinals owner Chris O&#x27;Brien hastily scheduled two games against the Hammond Pros and the Milwaukee Badgers, both of whom had already disbanded for the season. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s intention appears not to have been to secure the championship, but to improve their record so as to entice the Chicago Bears and their star Red Grange into one last game. The game against the Badgers spurred a scandal of its own, when the Badgers filled out their roster with four high school players, in contravention of NFL rules. Both teams were sanctioned by the league. Regardless, with Pottsville out of the league, the Cardinals had the best record, and were awarded the championship by the league. For his part, O&#x27;Brien refused to accept the title, and afterward the league never officially awarded it at all. Later both the franchise and the NFL would claim the Cardinals as the 1925 champions. The Cardinals did not attempt to publicly take credit for the title until 1933, when it was acquired by Charles Bidwill whose descendants still own the modern-day franchise (since relocated to St. Louis and now Arizona). The Cardinals have won only one further NFL title, in 1947, leading to discussion that the franchise is &quot;cursed&quot; as a result of the debacle.

===Return to the NFL===
The NFL reinstated the Maroons the very next season. The league feared that the Maroons would jump to the threatening American Football League. In 1926 Red Grange and his manager C. C. Pyle wanted an NFL franchise in New York City. However, that move would have infringed on the territorial rights of the New York Giants. Pyle and Grange were turned down, so they decided to start their own league, the AFL. To keep independent teams from joining Grange&#x27;s league, the NFL hastily expanded to 22 franchises. The Maroons were one of the teams added, or in this case reinstated. That year the Maroons were once again in the thick of title contention until late in the season. Pottsville&#x27;s shutout victories over the Buffalo Rangers and Akron Indians led to the team finishing with a 10–2–1 record and third place in the final standings. 1926 also saw the signing of George Kenneally, a rookie out of St. Bonaventure University, who earned all-pro status and was named team captain in just his second season, and would later become part owner of the club.

However, towards the end of the season, the Maroons management struggled to meet its financial obligations, and there were published reports of a strike among the team&#x27;s players.

The 1927 season saw a decline in the team&#x27;s on-field performance. Pottsville lost several of its stars, and others were growing older, and finished the season with a disappointing 5–8–0 record. Doc Striegel relinquished operational control of the team for the 1928 season by &quot;loaning&quot; it to a group of three players: Herb Stein, Pete Henry and Duke Osborn. Henry took over the coaching reins but the downward spiral continued. The Maroons ended what turned out to be their final season in Pottsville with a dismal 2–8–0 record. At the end of the season the players were given a small football made of anthracite coal, a memento of the last season played in Pottsville.

==Boston Bulldogs==

Striegel sold the club during the offseason to a New England–based partnership that included Maroons&#x27; standout, George Kenneally. The new owners relocated the franchise to Boston prior to the 1929 season, where it was renamed the Bulldogs. The Bulldogs would be the first of a string of unsuccessful attempts at establishing an NFL team in Massachusetts, followed by the Boston Redskins in the 1930s (which relocated to Washington D.C. in 1937) and the Boston Yanks in the 1940s (which folded in 1948). It was not until 1970, when the American Football League&#x27;s Patriots, (established in 1960) joined the NFL that the league were able to establish a permanent presence in New England&#x27;s most populous market: in this regard, the Patriots required a hostile takeover to avoid being relocated in the 1990s.

Six veteran Maroons players made the move with the team. Dick Rauch also returned to the fold, resuming his position as head coach. Based at Boston&#x27;s Braves Field, the Bulldogs nonetheless had a two-game swan song in their old stomping grounds, defeating both the Buffalo Bison on October 27 at Minersville Park and the Orange Tornadoes on October 29 at Mitchell Field. The team folded at season&#x27;s end with a 4–4–0 record.

Because the Washington Redskins began in 1932 as the Boston Braves, some Pottsville backers, with help from a few writers, have suggested that the team descended from the Maroons by way of the Boston Bulldogs. The 1932 Boston franchise, however, had no relationship to the 1929 Bulldogs (that team instead descended from the Tornadoes, by way of the 1931 Cleveland Indians).

==Today==

In 1963, the NFL created a special committee to investigate the 1925 controversy. The committee brought the Maroons&#x27; claim to a team owners meeting that year, where the owners voted 12–2 in favor of keeping the championship with the Cardinals. That same year, the surviving members of the Maroons donated their own championship trophy out of coal that they carved back in 1925, and presented it to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, where it can be seen today. 

The 1925 Maroons have since been immortalized in Pottsville, where there are establishments bearing the team&#x27;s name, including a section of U.S. Route 209 between Pottsville and Minersville named &quot;Pottsville Maroons Highway&quot; along with an inspirational picture of the 1925 &quot;World Champion&quot; team is displayed in the high school football team&#x27;s locker room. There was also a bar named after the team, but it was closed in 2021

Today, the people of Pottsville still embrace the legacy of the Maroons. The town contains the headquarters of the Pottsville Maroons Memorial Committee, whose job it is to keep alive the spirit of Pottsville&#x27;s only big-league sports franchise. In Pottsville, there was a major push led by Mayor John D.W. Reiley to restore the Maroons&#x27; 1925 title. The owner of a local embroidery shop still makes Maroons T-shirts and distributes them to residents and fans, along with the Schuylkill County Historical Society, which does the same. 

In 2003, Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell got involved in the Pottsville-NFL debate by enlisting city and borough councils across the state to lobby NFL owners to restore the Maroons&#x27; title. The NFL responded by holding a vote during at the October 2003 owners&#x27; meeting, where the team owners voted 30–2 not to reopen the case. Thus, the Cardinals are still listed as the 1925 NFL champions. Despite the long-time backing of Bears founder George Halas, Steelers founder Art Rooney and, more recently, Steelers chairman Dan Rooney, Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeff Lurie, the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue, the NFL&#x27;s other owners, unsurprisingly led by the Cardinals, continue to oppose any reversal. 

Rendell responded with an angry letter to Tagliabue, calling the NFL owners a group of &quot;cowardly barons&quot;. Rendell berated the National Football League, and declared he would have no more communication with league officials until they granted the Pottsville Maroons the 1925 title. The governor ended the letter saying, &quot;I am closing with the wish that every NFL franchise except for the Eagles and the Steelers lose large quantities of money&quot;. President of the United States George W. Bush also spoke on the subject. According to an article in &quot;ESPN the Magazine&quot;, Bush sent a handwritten note to ESPN calling the Maroons&#x27; case &quot;illuminating.&quot;

In 2006 David Fleming authored the book &quot;Breaker Boys: The NFL&#x27;s Greatest Team and the Stolen 1925 Championship&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;USA Today&quot; statistician Jeff Sagarin analyzed the two teams&#x27; statistics, including considerations for strength of schedule to determine which was the better team in 1925. The results showed the Maroons as the better team to the second-place Cardinals.

<doc id="239718" wikidata="Q7099491" url="?curid=239718" title="Orange/Newark Tornadoes">
<text>The Orange Tornadoes and Newark Tornadoes were two manifestations of a long-lived professional American football franchise that existed in some form from 1887 to 1941 and from 1958 to 1970, having played in the American Amateur Football Union from 1888 to 1895, the National Football League from 1929 to 1930, the American Association from 1936 to 1941, the Atlantic Coast Football League from 1963 to 1964 and 1970, and the Continental Football League from 1965 to 1969. The team was based for most of its history in Orange, New Jersey, with many of its later years in Newark. Its last five seasons of existence were as the Orlando Panthers, when the team was based in Orlando, Florida. The NFL franchise was sold back to the league in October 1930. The team had four head coaches in its two years in the NFL – Jack Depler in Orange, and Jack Fish, Al McGall and Andy Salata in Newark.

==History==

===Early years===
The Orange Tornadoes can trace their roots back to the Orange Athletic Club. The Orange A.C. was originally an amateur football team that began play in 1887. The team&#x27;s first ever game was a 36–0 loss to the Seton Hall University football team. By the 1890s the Orange became a semi-pro team. In 1892, the team practiced under electric lights at night to prepare for an October 8 game against Rutgers College. The Orange A. C. would go on to win that game 22–10. In 1893, the team won the American Football Union Championship, after posting an 8–2 record. In 1902, the Orange A. C. played against Philadelphia Phillies and the Philadelphia Athletics of the first National Football League. The team also played in World Series of Football in that year, at Madison Square Garden. In 1902, Orange lost to All-Syracuse, 36–0. However, the team returned to the World Series of Football in 1903, when they played the Watertown Red &amp; Black and the eventual champion, the Franklin Athletic Club. Orange lost to Watertown, 11–0, and to Franklin, 12–0. However, it did manage to defeat the Oreo Athletic Club of Asbury Park, 22–0.

===Pre-NFL===
The Orange team became an established independent pro team from 1919 until 1928, under the nickname the Orange AC Golden Tornadoes. During this time, Orange defeated the New York Brickley Giants of the NFL. They also played pre-NFL versions of the Frankford Yellow Jackets and the Staten Island Stapletons. They also played against the Atlantic City Roses and the Millville Big Blue, two of the top independent teams of the 1920s. By 1928, Orange held the New York Giants and Frankford Yellow Jackets to close scores. On September 16, 1928, Orange held the 1927 NFL Champion New York Giants to just a 7–0 victory. A week earlier the NFL&#x27;s previous champions, the Frankford Yellow Jackets, were held to a 12–0 victory. Orange showed that their team could compete in the NFL.

While the Golden Tornadoes played in Orange, a separate Newark Bears played in the original American Football League in the 1926 season in Newark, unrelated to the Tornadoes team that would later take on that identity. That Newark Bears club was later absorbed into the Staten Island Stapletons.

==1929 season==

In 1929 Ole Haugsrud, the owner of Duluth Eskimos, sold his NFL franchise rights for the Eskimos to Piggy Simandl, a wholesale meat salesman and sports promoter from Orange, who named his franchise the Orange Tornadoes. The Tornadoes played their home games at Knights of Columbus Stadium. The first game for the new team was a scoreless tie against the New York Giants on September 29, 1929. A week later the team recorded its first NFL win by defeating the Boston Bulldogs 7–0. The victory came off a short George Pease pass to Paul Longua, who ran 60 yards for a touchdown. However, the following week, Orange experienced its first NFL loss in a 7–0 defeat to the 1928 NFL Champions, the Providence Steamroller. The team regrouped on October 19, 1929, and the Tornandoes held the Frankford Yellow Jackets to a 6–6 tie at Frankford Stadium. A week later the team rallied from a 13–0 deficit to defeat the Boston Bulldogs, 19–13.

On October 29, 1929, the Bulldogs and Tornadoes met again to play, in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Prior to 1929, the Bulldogs played as the Pottsville Maroons and the teams played for their still loyal fans at the Maroons&#x27; Minersville Park. This time however, the Tornadoes lost 6–0 by way of a 4-yard touchdown run from Boston&#x27;s Tony Latone. On October 3, the Tornadoes held the Staten Island Stapletons to a scoreless tie at Thompson Stadium. During that game the Stapletons were within scoring distance three times, but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Tornadoes only penetrated the Staten Island 20-yard line once.

The Orange then lost a rematch against the New York Giants, 22–0, a week later. But after a scoreless tie against Frankford, the Orange defeated the Staten Island Stapletons 3–0, due to a Felix McCormick field goal. However, the next game, against the Chicago Cardinals, resulted in a 26–0 Tornadoes loss. The Cardinals, led by Ernie Nevers, put up 20 points in the second quarter of the game. The Tornadoes then ended their 1929 season with a 10–0 loss to Frankford. They finished with a 3–5–4 record, scoring 35 points, while giving up 80.

==1930==

The team&#x27;s fortune in the NFL changed for the worse after it moved to Newark in 1930. During the team&#x27;s time in Newark, it played its home games at Newark Schools Stadium. Head coach Jack Depler defected to buy the Dayton Triangles, moving that team to Brooklyn and transforming that team into the Brooklyn Dodgers. He took most of the members of the 1929 Tornadoes with him. Meanwhile, the Tornadoes went through three coaches during the 1930 season, and the team&#x27;s only victory during the 1930 season was against the Frankford Yellow Jackets.

The last game for the Newark Tornadoes was against the New York Giants, a 34–7 loss on October 29, 1930. The franchise ended league play after the 1930 season and was sold back to the NFL. The league ordered the franchise sold to the highest bidder prior to the 1931 season, but there were no takers, and a league-owned Cleveland Indians assumed the Tornadoes&#x27; place in the NFL for that season.

In 1932, a Boston-based group headed by George Preston Marshall won a new NFL franchise. The new team would be named the Boston Braves, now the Washington Commanders. Strong circumstantial evidence indicates that Marshall&#x27;s group was awarded the remains of the failed Newark organization. The NFL&#x27;s decision to auction off the Tornadoes to the highest bidder indicated its intent to replace the franchise, and Marshall&#x27;s group was the next to receive a franchise (though the league had temporarily added a league-owned franchise, the Cleveland Indians, to fill the Tornadoes&#x27; position in 1931). Additionally, Eskimos owner Haugsrud recalled in 1974 letter to George Halas that the Eskimos franchise was transferred to New Jersey before being transferred to Boston. However, the NFL considers the Commanders to be a 1932 expansion team and not a continuation of the Tornadoes, just as it does not consider the Tornadoes to be a continuation of the Eskimos. Likewise, the Commanders do not claim the Tornadoes or Eskimos (nor the Indians) as part of their own legacy.

==Tornadoes and Bears in the American Association==
Though the NFL franchise had moved to Newark, owner Edwin Simandl had kept a barebones organization back in Orange, just in case the NFL Tornadoes failed. When they did, he moved as many players as he could from the Newark squad back to Orange. The minor league Tornadoes played in various leagues, including the American Association, of which it was a charter member. The Orange Tornadoes moved back to Newark in 1937 and were eventually bought by the Chicago Bears. Playing under the name Newark Bears (a name previously used by the Newark Bears of the 1926 American Football League), the team played in the AA through 1941.

The team did not return after World War II; instead, George Halas took what was left of the team and split it into the Newark Bombers and the Akron Bears. The Bloomfield Cardinals replaced both teams in 1947. The NFL severed ties with all minor league teams in 1948.

==Uniforms==
In 1929, Orange experimented with using letters instead of numbers on player jerseys; Heinie Benkert, for example, wore the letter &quot;C&quot; on his uniform.

<doc id="239721" wikidata="Q1142715" url="?curid=239721" title="Duluth Eskimos">
<text>The Duluth Eskimos were a professional football team from Duluth, Minnesota in the National Football League (NFL). After spending most of their time as a traveling team, they withdrew from the league after the 1927 season.

A distinction of the Eskimos is they were one of the first NFL teams to use a logo.

==History==
===Initial formation===
The team initially formed in 1923 as the Kelleys (officially the Kelley Duluths, after the Kelley-Duluth Hardware Store). The team joined the National Football League on July 28, 1923. The team was put together by Kelley-Duluth Hardware Store owner M. C. Gebert with the help of Dewey Scanlon, a college graduate who played football at Valparaiso University in Indiana.

The Kelleys, residing in the northernmost city in the NFL at the time, had the disadvantage of not being able to play at home during late November and early December, due to the harsh winters in northern Minnesota. This meant that Duluth either played unusually short seasons (they played only 16 games in three years as the Kelleys—seven in 1923, six in 1924 and three in 1925) or had to play on the road (as the Eskimos did, which allowed them to have much longer schedules). Duluth&#x27;s best season came in 1924, when the Kelleys went 5–1, putting the Kelleys in fourth place.

===Team renames===
The Kelleys lost their name sponsorship in 1926, but signed star running back Ernie Nevers. The team renamed themselves Ernie Nevers&#x27;s Eskimos in response to these developments. The 1926 NFL season saw an increased emphasis on traveling teams: the Los Angeles Buccaneers represented the West Coast, the Louisville Colonels represented the Southeast, and the Buffalo Rangers represented Texas and the Desert Southwest. The Eskimos joined in on the trend, becoming a traveling team (assumably representing the far northern states) and allowing themselves to play a far longer season than the Kelleys did. After one home game at the beginning of the 1926 season, the Eskimos never played in Duluth again. The team finished in the middle of the NFL standings in 1926, prompting the Eskimos to continue the traveling team setup. In 1927, the results were far more negative: winning only one game. Owner Ole Haugsrud then sold the team back to the league at the end of the season. Haugsrud was able to buy 10% of the Minnesota Vikings (90% of the team was owned by an ownership group that had originally planned to launch a separate team in the American Football League).

===Later years===
Due to various transactions, the Kelleys/Eskimos have a tenuous link to the modern NFL. Edwin Simandl, a promoter in Orange, New Jersey; bought the defunct franchise on July 27, 1929, for the 1929 season and used it to promote his decades-old Orange Tornadoes to the major leagues. Since the franchise had been dormant for a year, the NFL did not consider the Tornadoes to be the successors of the Eskimos. The Tornadoes moved to Newark for the 1930 season before going back to the minors. When Simandl handed his NFL franchise rights back to the league, it was understood that the first new expansion team of the 1931 season would receive the Tornadoes&#x27; old franchise. Because of the Great Depression, no buyer was found.

In 1932, a Boston group headed by George Preston Marshall received the next expansion franchise; strong circumstantial evidence indicates that it was awarded the assets of the failed Tornadoes organization. For instance, in 1974, Haugsrud wrote Halas and recalled that the Eskimos were relaunched in New Jersey as the Tornadoes, and that franchise was ultimately sold to Marshall&#x27;s group. This group used it to start the Boston Braves. In 1933, the team was renamed the Redskins, and in 1937 it moved to Washington, D.C. where it still plays as the Washington Commanders. However, due to the two-year period of dormancy, the Commanders and the NFL consider the Boston/Washington franchise as a separate organization dating to 1932, and not as a continuation of the Tornadoes nor the Eskimos/Kelleys.

A second, unrelated, Duluth football team carried the &quot;Eskimos&quot; name, and played at the Northwest Football League in 1936.

==Legacy==
The 2008 film &quot;Leatherheads&quot; is partially based on the story of the Duluth Eskimos.

On May 18, 2015, local lawmakers of one town in the Duluth-Superior area passed a motion to bring the NFL back to the region via team relocation and also voted in favor of an outdoor football stadium despite no current means of financing it. It is unclear if their proposal was ever formally submitted to the NFL.

<doc id="239727" wikidata="Q1269184" url="?curid=239727" title="Menas of Constantinople">
<text>Menas of Constantinople (also &quot;Minas&quot;; ; died 25 August 552), considered a saint in the Chalcedonian-affirming Church and by extension both the Eastern Orthodox Church and Catholic Church of modern times, was born in Alexandria, and enters the records in high ecclesiastical office as presbyter and director of the Hospital of Sampson in Constantinople, where tradition has him linked to saint Sampson the Hospitable directly, and in the healing of Byzantine emperor Justinian I from the bubonic plague in 542. He was appointed Patriarch of Constantinople by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I on 13 March 536. Pope Agapetus I consecrated him to succeed Anthimus I of Constantinople, who was condemned as a monophysite. This was the first time that a Pope consecrated a Patriarch of Constantinople.

At some date, very soon after his election, he received the order (keleusis) from the Emperor, whose text is not preserved, but which instructed him to call a synodos endemousa to examine the case of Anthimus, which would be heard at a series of five sessions, beginning on 2 May and ending 4 June 536. This Synod condemned Anthimus, as noted in Novellae Constitutiones XLII from Justinian, addressed directly to Menas. Within this same effort from Justinian to seal the growing rift between the Patriarch in Constantinople and that of Jerusalem, Menas later took a position against Origen, a crisis merging into the Three-Chapter Controversy, an attempt to condemn the writings of certain non-Chalcedonian figures. Menas&#x27; patriarchate represents the greatest extent of papal influence in Constantinople. Almost immediately after the events of 536, which may be viewed as a Chalcedonian victory over monophysites, the ordination of an independent network of alleged monophysite / self-professed miaphysite bishops claiming apostolic authority would begin, leading eventually to the formation of a separate non-Chalcedonian church, the still-existing Syrian Orthodox Church that would be in communion with other excommunicated sees of the same theological persuasion. Justinian and Menas&#x27; efforts for doctrinal Church unity would meet with failure.

It was during his patriarchate that emperor Justinian&#x27;s church of Hagia Sophia, then the largest building in the world and the seat of the Patriarchs, was consecrated. Also, in 551 the Emperor compelled Menas to call what would be the Second Council of Constantinople, to reconcile the Western and Eastern Churches around the Three-Chapter Controversy, to be chaired ultimately by his successor Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople in 553.

He died peacefully in 552. His feast day in both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions is observed on 25 August.

<doc id="239728" wikidata="Q5095811" url="?curid=239728" title="Chicago Tigers">
<text>The Chicago Tigers of the American Professional Football Association (APFA) played their first and only season in 1920, the first year of the league (1920), and have the distinction of being the first NFL team to fold. They had a record of 2 wins, 5 losses and 1 tie. The team played its home games at Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field (then called Cubs Park) and was the first NFL team to do so. The Tigers were never formally members of the APFA. However, since the team played seven games against APFA teams in 1920, resulting in a 1–5–1 league record, they are generally included in the league standings.

==The franchise==
According to Emil Klosiinkski in the book, &quot;Pro Football in the Days of Rockne&quot;, the Tigers&#x27; main offensive weapon was their passing game. This specifically referred to the passes thrown by Johnny Barrett and Milt Ghee to Jack Meagher and Oscar Knop. On October 24, 1920, the Decatur Staleys (renamed the Chicago Bears in 1922) played a game against the Tigers at Cubs Park and billed it as &quot;the season&#x27;s most professional game&quot; that would also determine the &quot;pro title&quot;. Many Decatur games, at the time, were billed as championships in an attempt to lure crowds. The Staleys defeated the Tigers 10–0.

==Winner-take-all legend==
In 1920 the Tigers and Racine Cardinals were playing for the same Chicago fan dollar. Legend has it that the Cardinals&#x27; owner Chris O’Brien offered to play for the right to represent the city of Chicago in the APFA, and that Tigers’ owner Guil Falcon had agreed to the terms. The game resulted in a 6–3 Cardinals win, with Paddy Driscoll scoring the game&#x27;s only touchdown on a 40-yard run. The Tigers finished the season with a 2–5–1 record and, as allegedly promised, dropped out of the league. 

However, there are three problems with this story: first, the Tigers played two more league games after losing to the Cardinals; second, O&#x27;Brien was willing to let the Decatur Staleys play in Chicago the following season (in fact, it was the Staleys that proved to be the Tigers&#x27; &quot;actual&quot; last league opponent); and third, there is no contemporary evidence for the challenge.

According to the NFL, the Chicago Tigers folded between the 1920 and 1921 seasons.

<doc id="239730" wikidata="Q5120227" url="?curid=239730" title="Cincinnati Celts">
<text>The Cincinnati Celts (pronounced with a hard C) was the first professional football team to play in Cincinnati, Ohio. The team played in the unofficial &quot;Ohio League&quot; and the American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922). The Celts were a traveling team, playing all of their APFA games in other cities&#x27; stadia. In its only season in the APFA, 1921, the team had a record of 1–3. For the entire span of the team&#x27;s existence, the Celts were coached by Mel Doherty, who was also the team&#x27;s center.

==History==

===Origins===
The Celts were established in 1910 as a semi-pro team made up primarily of players from Miami University in nearby Oxford. During the first 10 years of their existence, the team flourished while playing numerous semi-pro teams from Ohio. An early member of the squad, George Roudebush, referred to the team as being run “by a bunch of wild Irishmen.” In 1914, Lou Partlow played for the Celts.

====1916 Pine Village game====
One of the greatest moments in the team&#x27;s early existence came against a team from Pine Village, Indiana, in 1916. While Pine Village consisted of only 300 residents, it was the top team in Indiana before World War I, compiling a record of 12 undefeated seasons. In 117 games, the team had only one tie-game finish. Pine Village faced the Celts before a crowd of 2,500 people in nearby Lafayette. With Pine Village leading Cincinnati 6–2, the Celts were forced to punt. George Roudebush then lined up behind the punter. Under the rules of the time, anyone lining up behind the punter was eligible to recover the kick as a free ball. After the ball was kicked, Roudebush ran down the field. Pine Village, not wanting to touch the ball, was unaware that Roudebush was eligible to recover it. Roudebush recovered the ball in the Pine Village end zone, giving the Celts a 9–6 victory.

===NFL===
The Celts were not initially invited to join the new American Professional Football Association (APFA), later known as the National Football League, when the circuit was established in 1920. The team accepted an invitation the following year, but proved unequal to the task, being outscored 117–14 in their only four league games. The team&#x27;s only two touchdowns, and sole victory, came during a 14–0 shutout of the Muncie Flyers. The Celts also faced the 1920 APFA champion Akron Pros, Cleveland Tigers and the Evansville Crimson Giants, losing handily in each contest. The Celts finally withdrew from the league in 1922, just prior to it being renamed the National Football League. For many years, the NFL record book listed the Celts as having an APFA record of 0–8–0. After reviewing records from the era, the NFL corrected the standings.

The team&#x27;s finances were also troubling. Game attendance for the Celts never reached above 2,500 spectators. As a result of this and other financial issues, the Celts were unable to pay the nominal league fees. The Celts continued as an amateur team until 1923.

<doc id="239731" wikidata="Q1092247" url="?curid=239731" title="Cincinnati Reds (NFL)">
<text>The Cincinnati Reds were a National Football League team that played the 1933 season and the first eight games of the 1934 season. The football Reds played most of their home games at Crosley Field. Other home games were played at Dayton&#x27;s Triangle Park, Portsmouth&#x27;s Universal Stadium and Xavier University&#x27;s Corcoran Stadium in a rare night game against the Chicago Cardinals.

The team was eventually suspended for failure to pay league dues during the 1934 season and the St. Louis Gunners, an independent team, replaced the Reds on the schedule for the last three games.

The Reds hold the dubious distinction of having the two lowest officially recognized season scoring totals in NFL history. In 1933 they scored 38 points in 10 games, tying the 1942 Detroit Lions for second on that list. In 1934 the Reds and Gunners combined for only 37 points in 11 games with the Reds, themselves, scoring only 10 points in 8 games before their suspension. The franchise was shut out in 12 of its 18 games. By comparison, the 75 points scored by the Reds and Gunners in 21 games over two seasons only exceed the 73 points scored by the Chicago Bears in the 1940 NFL Championship Game by two, and by three the 72 points scored by the Washington Redskins on November 27, 1966, the record for points scored by a team in a regular season game. Further, the 1950 Los Angeles Rams &quot;averaged&quot; 38.83 points &quot;per game&quot;, the highest such average in NFL history.

These records, however, only consider NFL seasons going back to 1932, the first year in which official statistical records were kept. Several teams failed to score at least 10 points in seasons of varying length (up to 8 games in some cases) between 1920 and 1931.

Alvin J. Jolley was named the team&#x27;s coach in the summer of 1933.

<text>The St. Louis Gunners were an independent professional football team based in St. Louis, Missouri, that played the last three games of the 1934 National Football League season, replacing the Cincinnati Reds on the league schedule after the Reds&#x27; league membership was suspended. They won their first game against the Pittsburgh Pirates (now Steelers) 6–0, and lost the last two to the Detroit Lions (40–7) and the Green Bay Packers (21–14). Six of the Reds players joined the team for the last two games. The team was headquartered at the St. Louis National Guard Armory, which accounts for its nickname the &#x27;Gunners&#x27;.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1931, the 128th Field Artillery of the Missouri National Guard, announced through its spokesman that it would sponsor a team for the upcoming football season. The club was originally called the Battery A Gunners from its association with the Guard. Future Hall-of-Famer Jimmy Conzelman, was named the team&#x27;s first head coach. Bud Yates was named the team&#x27;s general manager.

===1931–1933===
The Gunners posted a 5–2–1 record in 1931. However, they lost to the NFL&#x27;s Chicago Cardinals, 26–6. After the game, Cardinals captain, Ernie Nevers, called the Gunners the &quot;best independent club we have ever faced.&quot; A game against a second NFL team, the New York Giants, was scheduled and later canceled that season, to avoid conflict with another game involving a team of Notre Dame All-Stars.

For the team&#x27;s second season, Bullet Baker was named the team&#x27;s new coach. While most of the core of the team was kept intact, the Gunners brought in Dick Thornton and Mack Gladden from the University of Missouri. Meanwhile, Yates left the team for the season, for a position with the cross-town St. Louis Veterans. The 1932 Gunners posted a 7–4–1 record. The team was able to play its rival, the Memphis Tigers, to a standoff in three games, St. Louis winning 6–0, Memphis winning 12–0, and the third game ending in a scoreless tie. Later that year, the Tigers, Gunners and the Oklahoma City Chiefs each laid some claim to a mythical &quot;independent championship,&quot;. Two of the team&#x27;s losses that season came against NFL caliber opponents, the Cardinals, 20–7, and the Portsmouth Spartans, 12–0.

By 1933, the team had been renamed the &quot;St. Louis Gunners&quot;. Most of the ties the team had with the National Guard had been severed. For example, the players were no longer required to stay at the Battery A barracks, as they had in the past. Dick Frahm, Babe Lyon, and Charley Malone were signed from the Washington Redskins. The team posted an 11–2–3 record in 1933. That year it managed to defeat many of the NFL teams it faced. The Gunners defeated the NFL&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers 21–2, and the Chicago Cardinals 28–7. The team also held the Chicago Bears to a scoreless tie. The team&#x27;s only two NFL losses of the year came against the Green Bay Packers and the Cincinnati Reds. The team had also managed to outscore its opponents 297–72.

===Entry into the NFL===
On August 8, 1934, before the start of the NFL season, St. Louis purchased the NFL&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds for $20,000. However, the Gunners needed the other league owners to approve the sale. Only then would the Gunners would be official members. On August 17, the other owners decided to reject the Gunners bid to buy the Reds, probably because St. Louis was considered to be too remote from the rest of the clubs, most of which were in the Northeast, and yearly trips there would have increased travel expenses. Meanwhile, the Gunners declined membership in the minor league American Football League. As a result, the new league decided to form the St. Louis Blues. Gunners GM Bud Yates was credited with founding the team. The Blues lured Dick Frahm away from the Gunners and even took over the lease of Public Schools Stadium. As a result, the Gunners moved their home games to Sportsman&#x27;s Park. Meanwhile, Chile Walsh became the team&#x27;s fourth head coach in four years.

The Gunners started their 1934 season, 5–0 against several semi-pro teams. The team was searching desperately for decent teams to compete against. However, on November 6, 1934, the NFL finally approved the sale of the Cincinnati Reds to St. Louis for $20,000 – $30,000. The Gunners were now officially members of the NFL and were invited to play the Reds last 3 games of the 1934 NFL season. The Blues then moved to Kansas City two days later in order to avoid fighting the Gunners for control of the St. Louis fan base.

===1934 NFL season===
The Gunners defeated their first NFL opponent, the Pittsburgh Pirates, 6–0. However, a week later they were defeated by the Detroit Lions 40–7. The team managed to defeat the Pirates again in a 10–0 rematch, but the game, scheduled while the Gunners were still playing independently, was subsequently ruled an exhibition. The Gunners lost to the Packers a week later, 21–14, before dropping another close game to the Dodgers 17–14. The Gunners ended their 1934 season with a 7–0 win over the Kansas City Blues.

The team then moved to the rival American Football League where it folded after a season.

<text>A sound box or sounding box (sometimes written soundbox) is an open chamber in the body of a musical instrument which modifies the sound of the instrument, and helps transfer that sound to the surrounding air. Objects respond more strongly to vibrations at certain frequencies, known as resonances. The frequency and strength of the resonances of the body of a musical instrument have a significant impact on the tone quality it produces. The air inside the chamber has its own resonances, and these interact with the resonances of the body, altering the resonances of the instrument as a whole. The sound box typically adds resonances at lower frequencies, enhancing the lower-frequency response of the instrument.

The distinctive sound of an instrument with a sound box owes a lot to the alteration made to the tone. A sound box is found in most string instruments. The most notable exceptions are some electrically amplified instruments like the solid body electric guitar or the electric violin, and the piano which uses only a sound board instead. Drumhead lutes such as the banjo or &quot;erhu&quot; have at least one open end of the sound box covered with animal skin (or a skin-like acrylic material). Open back banjos are normally used for clawhammer and frailing, while those used for bluegrass have the back covered with a resonator.

In some arrangements, loudspeakers are also mounted on a sound box to enhance their output, particularly bass speakers. One notable example of this arrangement is called the bass reflex enclosure. However, in these cases the box resonance is carefully tuned so as to make the sound more equal across frequencies, rather than to impart a particular character to the reinforced sound.

<text>The Cleveland Tigers were the first Cleveland team franchise in what became the National Football League (NFL). The Tigers played in the &quot;Ohio League&quot; before joining the American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League in 1922) during the 1920 and 1921 seasons.

==History==
The Cleveland Indians football team was originally established in 1916 and played in the Ohio League. The team was formed after the Massillon Tigers raided the Akron Indians roster in 1915 and took away many of their star players. That year Peggy Parratt, the Akron Indians player-coach formed the Cleveland Indians with several former ex-Akron Indians players and a few new ex-college players. Despite a winning record, the 1916 Indians season was disappointing, losing twice to the Canton Bulldogs, who were led by Jim Thorpe, and splitting a pair of games with the Columbus Panhandles.

In 1920, when owners of professional teams organized a more structured league, Jimmy O&#x27;Donnell, a local sports promoter, obtained the Cleveland franchise. O&#x27;Donnell, also the owner of a semi-pro baseball team called the Tigers, was aided in his football venture by Stan Cofall, a football star at Notre Dame from 1914 to 1916, and with the Massillon Tigers. Cofall helped re-organize the Cleveland team in 1919 and, along with O&#x27;Donnell attended the September 1920 meeting in Canton, Ohio that founded the American Professional Football Association, which became the NFL the following year. For the first half of the 1920 season, Cofall was the Tigers&#x27; player-coach; he was also elected vice-president of the new league.

In their first season, the Cleveland Tigers scored only 2 touchdowns and lost 3 games by 7–0 scores, compiling a record of 1–4–2. For the 1921 season, the name of the team was changed to the Indians, partly because it was a stock name in Cleveland (a baseball team had also used the name since 1915) but more because three Native Americans were signed away from the Canton Bulldogs. In 1921 the Tigers returned with two future Hall of Famers, Joe Guyon and player-coach Jim Thorpe. The team won its first two games. However, during the team&#x27;s second game, Thorpe injured his ribs and was lost for the season. The Tigers then narrowly lost the next four games. When Thorpe returned to action in a postseason game against the New York Brickley Giants in December, the Tigers were again victorious.

Early in 1922, O&#x27;Donnell received league permission to suspend operations for a year, but when he could not post the $1,000 annual guarantee the NFL required, his franchise was canceled. Guyon and Thorpe went off to LaRue, Ohio to form the Oorang Indians. A new Indians franchise was later purchased by Samuel Deutsch who operated the team in 1923. He then relocated the Canton Bulldogs to Cleveland in 1924 and merged them with his Indians team. A third, unrelated Indians team also played in the NFL in 1931.

<text>The Cleveland Indians were a professional football team in the National Football League for the 1931 season.

The 1931 team was a league-sponsored club that played the majority of their games on the road. The NFL had acquired the franchise of the Orange/Newark Tornadoes when that team left the league after the 1930 season; the league intended to locate this team permanently in Cleveland with new ownership. Jerry Corcoran assumed ownership of the team on behalf of the NFL and assumed management of the team.

Cleveland was chosen because of the recent construction of their brand-new Cleveland Stadium; at 83,000 seats, the massive stadium was by far the largest in the league, which was still regularly playing games in stadiums of under 10,000 fans in some of the smaller markets. However, game attendance for the Indians&#x27; two home games were nowhere near capacity (the home opener drew a mere 2,000 fans; the finale, a more respectable but still relatively small 10,000) and no suitable owner was found that would put the team in Cleveland, so the team&#x27;s spot in the league was sold to George Preston Marshall, who established a team in Boston (later known as the Redskins) in the 1932 season.

Among the games this incarnation of the Indians played was an exhibition against the Buffalo Bears in Buffalo, New York, a city that had lost their own NFL franchise, the Bisons, after the 1929 season. It would begin an extensive tradition of neutral-site NFL games in Buffalo that would last until the Buffalo Bills were established in 1960.

==Other Cleveland Indians teams in the NFL==
The &quot;Indians&quot; name was used previously for two other Cleveland-based NFL teams. They first use of the Indians name came in 1921, when the Cleveland Tigers became the &quot;Cleveland Indians&quot; before folding after the 1921 season. A second &quot;Indians&quot; NFL team arose in 1923. That team played as the &quot;Indians&quot; for the 1923 season before changing its name to the Cleveland Bulldogs in 1924. These three Cleveland teams are viewed as three totally different franchises by the NFL.

The 1931 Indians would be followed in the city by the Cleveland Rams, who joined the NFL in 1937 after one season in the American Football League and played in Cleveland through the 1945 season. The Rams were followed by the Cleveland Browns in 1946, who played their first four seasons in the All-America Football Conference before joining the NFL in 1950.

<text>Karel Willem Frederik Marie Doorman (23 April 1889 – 28 February 1942) was a Dutch naval officer who during World War II commanded remnants of the short-lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command naval strike forces in the Battle of the Java Sea. He was killed in action when his flagship was torpedoed during the battle, having chosen to go down with the ship.

== Biography ==
=== Early career ===
Doorman was born 1889 in Utrecht, and raised as a Roman Catholic from a military family. In 1906, he and his brother Lou ACM Doorman were commissioned as midshipmen. In 1910, he was promoted to officer and moved to the Dutch East Indies aboard the cruiser &quot;Tromp&quot;. During his first three years of duty from January 1912 to December 1913, he was placed aboard the survey vessels and and was mainly tasked with mapping the coastal waters of New Guinea. Early in 1914, he returned to the Netherlands on board the cruiser . In March 1914, he requested a transfer to the Aviation Service.

In April 1914, Doorman served on the during its mission to the Principality of Albania to recover the body of Major Lodewijk Thomson of the International Gendarmerie. Doorman&#x27;s transfer to the Aviation Service was approved in mid-1915 and he became one of the first naval officers to be awarded his pilot wings.

=== Naval aviator ===
From 1915 to 1918, Doorman was stationed at Soesterberg with the Aviation Service under the command of Captain (later Major) of Engineers Henk Walaardt. There, he met Albert Plesman, an observer who later became a pilot. In 1915, Doorman was awarded a civilian pilot&#x27;s license and in 1916 he was awarded a naval pilot&#x27;s license. From 1917 to 1921, he was an instructor at Soesterberg Air Base and from October 1918 at the Naval Air Base De Kooy in Den Helder. Doorman commanded this Naval Air Base from 1919 to 1921. Because of his merits as an organizer in the nascent field of naval aviation, he was made a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1922.

Budget cuts and an arm injury ended Doorman&#x27;s active flying career but from November 1921 to November 1923, he attended the Higher Naval School in The Hague; this training, which included coursework in aircraft and naval vessel communication, laid the groundwork for his later career. After he completed this training, he was placed with the Department of the Navy at Batavia in December 1923.

=== Personal life ===

From 1919 to 1934, Doorman was married to Justine A.D. Schermer. Their son was born in 1928. The marriage ended in 1934, soon after the birth of a third child. That same year, Doorman married Isabella J.J.J. Heyligers, with whom he had a fourth child.

=== Later naval career ===
In 1926, for the first time in eleven years, Doorman gained a longer appointment aboard the armored naval vessel . Until late 1927, he was the ship&#x27;s gunnery officer and later also became its first officer. Early in 1928, Doorman returned to the Netherlands, where he ran equipment-purchasing for The Hague&#x27;s Naval Aviation department. In 1932, under his command, the mine-layer HNLMS &quot;Prins van Oranje&quot; sailed three times in the same year to the Dutch East Indies. The same year, he also commanded two destroyers; and ; the latter saw action against the rebels on HNLMS &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; in February 1933.

In January 1934, Doorman returned to the Netherlands with &quot;Evertsen&quot; and spent three years as Chief of Staff of the naval commander in Den Helder. In 1936, he submitted a request to the Secretary of Defense to command a cruiser in the Dutch East Indies. Consequently, he departed as a captain in 1937 for the Dutch East Indies, commanding the cruisers and . In August 1938, he was appointed Commander of Naval Aviation in the Dutch East Indies. From his headquarters at Surabaya Morokrembangan Naval Air Station, he made a number of inspection tours in the archipelago.

=== World War II ===
On 16 May 1940, Doorman was promoted to rear-admiral and on 13 June 1940, on board the light cruiser , he took command of the squadron previously led by Rear-Admiral GW Stöve at Surabaya. In early 1942 he led remnants of the ABDA Combined Striking Force.

On February 3, Doorman led a group of ships that went to stop a Japanese invasion force that was heading towards Makassar. While &quot;en route&quot;, his flotilla was observed by the Japanese and bombed, forcing it to turn back after several ships were damaged. This conflict was known as Battle of Makassar Strait, also called the Battle of the Flores Sea.

On 18 February, Japanese forces invaded Bali. Doorman led another force attempting to stop the invasion the next day. Due to the short notice and the challenge of consolidating his troops, three waves of counterattacks were planned. The first wave involving cruisers and destroyers was unsuccessful, culminating in the sinking of the Dutch destroyer . The second wave, consisting of a Dutch cruiser and several American destroyers was also unsuccessful, although they caused severe damage to a Japanese destroyer. The third wave of patrol boats encountered no Japanese forces. The failure to stop the Japanese led to the occupation of Bali. This engagement is known as the Battle of Badung Strait.

Doorman was killed in action when &quot;De Ruyter&quot; was hit by a Japanese Long Lance torpedo and sunk in the Battle of the Java Sea. Part of the crew was rescued but Doorman, following navy tradition, chose to go down with his ship. On 5 June 1942, he was posthumously made a Knight 3rd class in the Military William Order. The medal was awarded to the rear admiral&#x27;s eldest son on 23 May 1947 by Lieutenant-Admiral Conrad Helfrich on board . The ceremony was attended by Prince Bernhard.

=== &quot;I am attacking, follow me&quot; ===
Karel Doorman is often honoured because he signaled (&quot;I am attacking, follow me&quot;) during the Battle of the Java Sea, which some have considered gallant. However, one source doubts that he ever uttered those words.

On 27 February 1942, at approximately 4pm, the Japanese and the allied squadrons spotted each other. Karel Doorman realised that the Dutch fleet was outnumbered but nonetheless proceeded to attack. His actions lost the fleet and he ultimately went down with his ship. The guns of the two Japanese cruisers had a greater range than the Allied guns and at about 5pm the British cruiser was hit. Twenty minutes, later the Dutch destroyer was torpedoed exploding and breaking into two. Confusion arose in the Allied squadron over the way forward, compounded because HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; could only sail at half power and wanted to return to port at Soerabaja (now Surabaya).

Following instructions issued by High Command, Doorman gave the order to attack at the approach of the Japanese fleet. The tactical command was &quot;I am attacking, follow me&quot;; he did not signal at the beginning of the battle in the Java Sea. It is a loose translation of the signal sent by him, &quot;All ships – follow me&quot; to remedy the confusion. The battle on 27 February 1942 which, with interruptions, lasted for over seven hours, ended with the almost complete destruction of Doorman&#x27;s squadron. The squadron commander perished aboard the flagship, which sank after around 90 minutes.

==Memorials==
Four ships in the Royal Netherlands Navy were named after him: the escort carrier &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; (QH1), the aircraft carrier , the frigate &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; (F827), and the multi-role support vessel .

The Kloosterkerk in The Hague has a memorial plaque. Commemorations of the Battle of the Java Sea are regularly held.

<doc id="239743" wikidata="Q2984581" url="?curid=239743" title="Columbus Panhandles">
<text>The Columbus Panhandles were a professional American football team based in Columbus, Ohio. The club was founded in 1901 by workers at the Panhandle shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad. They were a part of the Ohio League from 1904 before folding after one season. Three years later, the team tried again, playing in the Ohio League from 1907 to 1919, not winning a championship, before becoming charter members of the American Professional Football Association (APFA) which became the National Football League (NFL).

The Panhandles are credited with playing in the first NFL game against the Dayton Triangles. They have no NFL championships, but Joseph Carr, the team&#x27;s owner from 1907 to 1922, is enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his work as NFL president.

==Origins==
The earliest existence of the Panhandles was in 1900; the &quot;Columbus Press-Post&quot; reported Jack Walsh creating the &quot;Panhandle railroad team&quot; consisting of &quot;big hardy railroad men.&quot; No other articles in 1900 were written about the Panhandles. A game was scheduled for October 19 of next year, however, no source provided an outcome. In 1901, managed by William Butler of the Ohio Medical University, the Panhandles played two games against the Columbus Barracks, a team consisting of local soldiers. The results were split; the first was a 2–6 loss while the second was a 12–6 win.

Butler left the Panhandles for unknown reasons, and the new manager for the 1902 season was Harry Greenwood. Greenwood placed advertisements in every newspaper he could in order to schedule games against local opponents. His ad read &quot;The Panhandle Athletic Club has organized a football team and would like to play any college, high school or manufacturing team on Saturday or Sunday.&quot; As a result, the Panhandles scheduled four games in 1902: three against the Columbus Barracks and one against the Dennison Panhandles, and finished with a 0–3–1 record.

Again, the Panhandles got a new manager for the 1903 season, E. E. Griest. Griest needed help with the team, so he hired Ben Chamberlain to coach the team. After an exhibition game against the Ohio State Buckeyes, the Panhandles won their first game of the season, a 38–0 victory over Neil Avenue Athletic Club. This victory gave the team some unexpected press; the &quot;Columbus Citizen&quot; wrote the first article praising the team. The Panhandles 1903 season ended with a 5–3 record.

=== Joe Carr ===

In 1904, Joseph Carr, who was a sports writer for the &quot;Ohio State Journal&quot; and manager of the railroad&#x27;s baseball team the Famous Panhandle White Sox, took over the football team. However, the Panhandles didn&#x27;t take off and the team played just two games. Carr tried again three years later in 1907. Carr saw the potential for professional football not only to be a great spectator sport but also to become a successful business venture and envisioned pro football being just as popular as Major League Baseball.

One of the first things Carr did when he became the owner of the Panhandles was to exploit one of the railroad&#x27;s policies. Since most of the team&#x27;s players were employed by the railroad, they could ride the train free of charge. Because of this perk, Carr was able to schedule mostly road games, eliminating the expenses of stadium rental, game promotion, and security for the field. While the team did play the majority of their games on the road as a traveling team, their home games were played at Indianola Park.
The Panhandles adopted an amateur sandlot mentality for their playing style. Since the team was composed mainly of railroad workers, the scenario gave the players limited time to practice and prepare for games. The Panhandles did the majority of their preparation during their lunch breaks. Workers had a one-hour break during a normal workday, and the players on the team usually took the first 15 minutes to eat lunch and used the remaining 45 minutes to practice football. An athletic field behind the railroad shops in Columbus became the team&#x27;s practice field.

===The Nessers===
However Carr knew that if his team was to succeed, he needed an attraction. Carr built his team around pro football&#x27;s most famous family the Nesser Brothers, who were already drawing crowds throughout the country. Carr used the seven Nesser brothers as the backbone of the Panhandles, and the football-playing family remained in that role for nearly 20 years. None of the Nessers attended college, despite many offers. The seven Nesser brothers, who worked as boilermakers for the Pennsylvania Railroad, were exceptionally large and strong for people living in the early 20th century. Frank Nesser was 6-foot 1-inch tall and weighed 235 pounds. They all were exceptionally great athletes for their time. Carr took out ads describing his Panhandles as the toughest professional team in football, led by the famous Nesser brothers. In 1921 the Panhandles line-up included player-coach Ted Nesser and his son Charlie. It is the only time in NFL history a father and son played together on the same team. The Nesser brothers nephew, Ted Hopkins and brother-in-law, John Schneider, also played on the team.

The Panhandles&#x27; rosters did not include many former college players or All-Americans, so the athletic field in the railroad yards was the place where the team found out who could play. The team&#x27;s &quot;dirty&quot; reputation was learned and developed on the railroad yards, not in college stadiums. The press sometimes criticized the Panhandles for their rough play; but it was a big draw for the fans and a main reason many paid to attend games.

===Columbus city champs era===

Over a span of 20 years, the Panhandles were considered the best pro team in the city of Columbus. The team compiled a 33–5 record against opponents from Columbus, including a 32–1 record over their last 33 games.

Between 1914 and 1916, which were seen as best years of the franchise, the Nesser-led team went a combined 22–10–1. The majority of the early pro teams would go out of their way to schedule the Panhandles, as they knew it would be easy to advertise a game featuring the famous Nessers. In 1915, The Panhandles were rumored to have played against the legendary Knute Rockne six times in 1915. According to the team, each time they played Rockne, he was on a different team. This rumor, however, is false; Rockne was too much of a family man to play that much pro football, and Notre Dame had most of its home games during the pro football season.

== NFL ==
On August 20, 1920, a meeting attended by representatives of four Ohio League teams—the Canton Bulldogs, the Cleveland Tigers, the Dayton Triangles, and the Akron Pros—was held. At the meeting, the representatives tentatively agreed to introduce a salary cap for the teams, not to sign college players nor players under contract with another team, and became united as the American Professional Football Conference. They then contacted other major professional teams and invited them to a meeting for September 17.

At the meeting in September, held at Ralph Hay&#x27;s Hupmobile showroom, representatives of the Rock Island Independents, the Muncie Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Cardinals, the Rochester Jeffersons, and the Hammond Pros were present. The following was achieved: the name of American Professional Football Association was chosen; officers of the league were elected with Jim Thorpe as president; a membership fee of $100 was set; a committee to draft a constitution was named; the secretary of the league was to receive a list of all players used during the season by January 1, 1921; and the trophy that would be awarded to the league champions. During this time, the Panhandles were admitted into the league.

=== First APFA game ===

The Panhandles may have played in the first game with two APFA opponents. However, due to not having the games start at a standardized time, and the failure of the future NFL to record the start times, historians can not determine for sure which two teams played in the first league match-up. What is known for a fact is that the first contests between teams listed as APFA members occurred on October 3, 1920. On that date, the Panhandles were defeated by the Dayton Triangles, 14–0, at Triangle Park, and the Rock Island Independents beat the Muncie Flyers, 45–0, in Rock Island. Frank Bacon of the Triangles is credited with the first punt return for a touchdown.

===Columbus Tigers===

Following the 1921 season, Carr became the league&#x27;s new president and renamed the APFA, the NFL. He then discontinued the Panhandles after the 1922 season because of cost and salary demands. Following the 1922 season, the Panhandles became the Columbus Tigers. In 1923, the Tigers attained their best ranking in the NFL, finishing eighth. During that season multiple players won awards. Rookie end Gus Tebell, who was also the coach, was awarded 1st Team All NFL by the &quot;Canton Daily News&quot; as well as the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot;. Gus Sonnenberg, Paul Goebel, Jack Sack, and Bob Rapp were all awarded 1st Team All-NFL by the &quot;Canton Daily News&quot;. Pete Stinchcomb was awarded 2nd Team All-NFL by &quot;Collyer&#x27;s Eye&quot;. During this time, and at the time of the team folding, Jerry Corcoran was owner of the Tigers.

The next season, they finished tenth. Boni Petcoff was awarded 1st Team All-NFL by the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot;. Petcoff and Paul Goebel were both awarded 2nd Team All NFL by the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot;, with the latter being awarded 2nd Team All NFL by the &quot;Collyer&#x27;s Eye&quot; as well. Then, the Tigers ended their final two seasons 20th and 19th, respectively.

<doc id="239744" wikidata="Q1179227" url="?curid=239744" title="Dayton Triangles">
<text>The Dayton Triangles were an original franchise of the American Professional Football Association (now the National Football League (NFL)) in 1920. The Triangles were based in Dayton, Ohio, and took their nickname from their home field, Triangle Park, which was located at the confluence of the Great Miami and Stillwater Rivers in north Dayton. They were the longest-lasting traveling team in the NFL (1920–1929), and the last such &quot;road team&quot; until the Dallas Texans in 1952, who, coincidentally, descended from the Dayton franchise.

The Texans players and assets were moved to Baltimore in 1953, and then to Indianapolis in 1983, where they now operate as the Colts, just 117 miles west of their origin.

==Origins==
The original Dayton Triangles members first began playing together as basketball players at St. Mary&#x27;s College, now the University of Dayton, from 1908 until 1912. After graduation, the players organized a basketball team of alumni, students, and other local athletes. They went by the name of the St. Mary&#x27;s Cadets. The Cadets claimed the title of &quot;World Basketball Champions&quot; by defeating the Buffalo German Ramblers.

In the fall of 1913, the St. Marys Cadets organized a football team. The team was coached by Louis Clark, who coached the St. Mary&#x27;s college football team as well. Al Mahrt was elected team captain. The team finished its first season with a 7–0 record and won the Dayton City Championship. They also won the Southern Ohio Championship by defeating the Cincinnati Celts 27–0 at Redland Park. The team won a second city championship in 1914, despite injuries to Al Mahrt and Babe Zimmerman. In 1915 the team changed its name to the Dayton Gym-Cadets after their presumed sponsors, the Dayton Gymnastic Club. That season saw Al Marhrt take over as the team&#x27;s coach. The team only lost one game that season, to the Columbus Panhandles. It also won its third city championship.

==1916–1919==
The team was reorganized in 1916 as a recreational football team from among the employees of three downtown Dayton factories: the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (or Delco), the Dayton Metal Products Company, and the Domestic Engineering Company (now called Delco-Light). Carl Storck, who later served as treasurer of the NFL and as acting league president from 1939 to 1941, co-sponsored the Dayton Cadets and used players recruited from the three factories to fill out the team roster. Storck would later become the team&#x27;s manager, while Bud Talbott, a Walter Camp All-American tackle and team captain at Yale University, was named the team&#x27;s coach. The team&#x27;s name was also changed to the Dayton Triangles that season.

In 1916, the Triangles went 9–1, defeating teams from Cincinnati, Detroit, Toledo and Pittsburgh. The Canton Bulldogs, with the legendary Jim Thorpe in the line-up, claimed the &quot;Ohio League&quot; Championship after their win over the Massillon Tigers. The Triangles challenged the Bulldogs to a game on December 10, 1916, but the game was never played. The following season saw the Triangles move into their new park, Triangle Park. The team&#x27;s 1917 campaign was successful. The team went 6–0–2 that season. The Triangles were able to score 188 points and gave up only 13 to their opponents.

===1918 Championship===
1918 saw the United States entry in World War I, as well as the devastating Spanish flu pandemic. While the Triangles lost players to military service, they also had many kept home with regular jobs in industries deemed essential to the war effort and, along with the few other teams still playing, far less competition for the talent pool. This allowed the Triangles to keep a team on the field and beat what few representative teams remained and eventually claiming an Ohio League Championship. The Triangle player-coach that season was Earle &quot;Greasy&quot; Neale, since Bud Talbott joined the army. During their championship run, the Triangles defeated future NFL teams, the Toledo Maroons, Hammond Pros, Columbus Panhandles and Detroit Heralds. The Triangles went 8–0–0 in 1918, one of two known teams to have collected a perfect record of more than five games that year, the other being the Buffalo Niagaras, whose 6–0–0 record was collected as a result of playing only teams from Buffalo and who built their team on many of the players left out of work because of the Ohio League teams&#x27; suspension. In 1919, they followed up their championship with a season record of 4–2–1.

==National Football League (NFL) era==

At the first meetings held on August 20, 1920, and September 17, 1920, at Ralph Hay&#x27;s Hupmobile dealership located in Canton, Ohio, the Triangles were represented by their manager Carl Storck as they became charter members of the new league called the American Professional Football Association (APFA), until 1922 when it was renamed the National Football League. During the latter meeting, Jim Thorpe was unanimously elected as the new league&#x27;s president. Also at this meeting, a membership fee of $100 per team was established, however George Halas stated that none of the charter teams ever paid it.

On October 3, 1920, the Triangles won what could be considered the very first APFA/NFL game, with a 14–0 defeat of the Columbus Panhandles at Triangle Park. The high point of the Triangles&#x27; 1920 season was a 20–20 tie at Triangle Park with Thorpe&#x27;s Canton Bulldogs; it was the first time a team had scored three touchdowns on the Bulldogs since 1915. Trailing the Triangles, 20–14, Thorpe nailed two late field goals to tie the score. Six games into the season, the Triangles remained undefeated (4–0–2) but in the final three games lost twice to the eventual league champion, the Akron Pros, ending 1920 with a 5–2–2 mark.

==Decline==
In 1922, the other teams in the NFL were recruiting and signing top college players from around the country; however Dayton continued to use mainly local players. This marked a decline in the team&#x27;s performance, and the Triangles ceased being competitive in the NFL. Because of their poor showing on the field, the Triangles were not able to draw crowds for home games: Triangle Park, with a seating capacity of 5,000, rarely saw that many fans. Soon, the combination of poor home gates and the lure of $2,500 guarantees to play at larger venues (like Wrigley Field, Comiskey Park and the Polo Grounds), made the Triangles primarily a traveling team.

By the late twenties, Dayton was one of the league&#x27;s doormats, winning just five of their 51 NFL contests from 1923 through 1929. Only the revenues from playing on the road kept them afloat. Also around this time, the NFL began shaking off its roots in the mid-sized Midwestern cities that had been the heartland of pro football in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Triangles were one of only three original NFL teams (along with the Bears and Cardinals) to survive the 1920s, and the only team from the Ohio League to survive past 1926. Nevertheless, by then it was apparent that Dayton was no longer large enough to support a team in the burgeoning league. Finally, on July 12, 1930, a Brooklyn-based syndicate headed by Bill Dwyer and Jack Depler bought the Triangles and moved them to Brooklyn as the Brooklyn Dodgers. Depler became the Dodgers&#x27; head coach, and stocked the roster with players from the NFL&#x27;s Orange Tornadoes, where he had previously been player-coach. Although the Dodgers operated under the Triangles franchise, they were essentially an expansion team. The roster was dominated by former Tornadoes, with most of the 1929 Triangles relegated to the bench.

==Lineage==
Due to numerous transactions over the years, the Triangles have a tenuous connection to a current NFL franchise, the Indianapolis Colts.

The Dodgers merged with the Boston Yanks franchise for the 1945 season due to player shortages. In 1946, Brooklyn owner Dan Topping jumped to the AAFC to become owner of the new league&#x27;s New York Yankees. The NFL awarded the Dodgers&#x27; players to the Boston Yanks.

In 1949, the Yanks moved to New York and became the New York Bulldogs, while the AAFC Yankees merged with the Brooklyn Dodgers and played as the Brooklyn-New York Yankees. When the AAFC merged with the NFL in 1950, the Yankees players were divided between the NFL&#x27;s two New York teams, the Giants and the Bulldogs. Shortly before the 1950 season, the Bulldogs were renamed the New York Yanks.

Due to heavy financial losses, the Yanks were sold back to the NFL in 1952. The Yanks&#x27; player contracts were awarded to a group from Texas, who moved them to Dallas for the 1952 season as the Dallas Texans.

The Texans were again sold back to the NFL midway through the season. Before the 1953 season, an ownership group in Baltimore was awarded an expansion franchise, the (new) Baltimore Colts. As part of the deal, the new Colts were awarded the remains of the Texans organization, including their player contracts. The Colts moved to Indianapolis in 1984 and still play there today.

In spite of the unbroken continuity of the franchises that began with the Triangles in 1913 and the Boston Yanks from 1944, the NFL considers the Colts to be a 1953 expansion team, not continuation of the Triangles or any other franchise. Likewise, the Colts do not claim the legacy of the Triangles or their successors as part of their history.

==Teams named after the football Triangles==
During the 1970s, the Dayton Triangles Soccer Club revived the name and enjoyed some success and recognition as a successful youth (and later semi-pro) soccer club. Like the football team, they took their name from the same city park and played an important role in development of soccer in the Miami Valley.

In 1973, the Dayton Triangles RFC club was founded. Like the aforementioned soccer club, this team also took its name from the original football team and city park. Through various amalgamations over the years, the club is still active under the name of the Dayton Area Rugby Club.

<text>John Scholasticus or &quot;Scholastikos&quot; (Greek: Ἰωάννης Γ&#x27; ό Σχολαστικός; 503 – 31 August 577) was patriarch of Constantinople from 12 April 565 until his death on 31 August 577. He is also regarded as a saint of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

== Life ==
He was born at Sirimis, in the region of Cynegia, near Antioch. There was a flourishing college of lawyers at Antioch, where he entered and did himself credit. This was suppressed in 533 by Emperor Justinian I. John was ordained and became agent and secretary of his church. This would bring him into touch with the court at Constantinople. When Justinian I, towards the close of his life, tried to raise the sect of the Aphthartodocetae to the rank of Orthodoxy and determined to expel Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople for his opposition, the able lawyer-ecclesiastic of Antioch, who had already distinguished himself by his great edition of the canons, was chosen to carry out the imperial will.

He was also credited for methodical classification of Canon law, the Digest of Canon Law. Following some older work which he mentions in his preface, he abandoned the historical plan of giving the decrees of each council in order and arranged them on a philosophical principle, according to their matter. The older writers had sixty heads, but he reduced them to fifty.

To the canons of the councils of Nicaea, Ancyra, Neocaesarea, Gangra, Antioch, Ephesus, and Constantinople, already collected and received in the Greek church, John added 89 &quot;Apostolic Canons&quot;, the 21 of Sardica, and the 68 of the canonical letter of Basil. Writing to Photius I of Constantinople, Pope Nicholas I cites a harmony of the canons which includes those of Sardica, which could only be that of John. When John came to Constantinople, he edited the Nomocanon, an abridgment of his former work, with the addition of a comparison of the imperial rescripts and civil laws (especially the Novels of Justinian) under each head. Theodore Balsamon cites this without naming the author, in his notes on the first canon of the Quinisext Council. In an MS. of the Paris library, the Nomocanon is attributed to Theodoret, but in all others to John. Theodoret would not have inserted the &quot;apostolical canons&quot; and those of Sardica, and the style has no resemblance to his. In 1661 these two works were printed at the beginning of vol. II of the &quot;Bibliotheca Canonica&quot; of Justellus, at Paris, Photius (Cod. lxxv.) mentions his catechism, in which he established the teaching of the consubstantial Trinity, saying that he wrote it in 568, under Emperor Justin II and that it was afterwards attacked by the impious John Philoponus. Johann Albert Fabricius considers that the Digest or Harmony and the Nomocanon are probably rightly assigned to John.

Little is known of his episcopal career. Seven months after his appointment Justinian I died. The new emperor, Justin II, was crowned by the patriarch, on 14 November 565.

He organized a compromise between the Chalcedonians and Non-Chalcedonians in 567, and temporarily reunited the two sects in 571.

John died shortly before Justin II in 577.

<doc id="239747" wikidata="Q5416026" url="?curid=239747" title="Evansville Crimson Giants">
<text>The Evansville Crimson Giants were a professional American football team based in Evansville, Indiana and were a part of the National Football League in 1921 and 1922. The Giants home games were played at Bosse Field. According to the &quot;Evansville Courier and Press&quot; in 1921, &#x27;they surprised local fans in developing a winning team&#x27; and &#x27;the Giants&#x27; one-sided victories over inferior non-league teams has had good fan reaction.&#x27; However, the team did not succeed, mostly due to scheduling mistakes and management problems. Evansville&#x27;s local sporting enthusiasts also failed to respond favorably and attend the home games.

==History==
===Ex-Collegians===
The Crimson Giants history is rooted in Evansville&#x27;s first significant semi-pro team, the Evansville Ex-Collegians, who began play in 1920. The Ex-Collegians played and followed the typical semi-professional template of the era. The team employed mostly local players almost exclusively. They paid those players a small sum based on gate receipts and on a game-by-game basis. The team also operated without any real management oversight, meaning that the players looked after the team&#x27;s finances, and scheduled games haphazardly. In 1920, a group of local businessmen tried to purchase the Ex-Collegians. However, the investors and the players failed to reach a compromise.

After the initial two victories over modest opponents, the Ex-Collegians bragged of possibly playing the most celebrated pro football team in the nation, the Canton Bulldogs, on Christmas Day, 1920. While the chances of the game taking place between Evansville and Canton were slim, the rumor of a Canton game was actually a marketing scheme to draw attention to the newly established Ex-Collegians. The team finished their 1920 season with a 7–1 record.

===Formation of the Crimson Giants===
In 1921, the same unnamed businessmen who failed to take over the Ex-Collegians in 1920 decided to form their own team. Frank Fausch, a Fullback for the Ex-Collegians, and Mark Ingle, an offensive lineman with the team, left the Ex-Collegians to create a new corporation, known as the &quot;American Football Association&quot;, which owned a new professional team soon nicknamed the Crimson Giants. Fausch served as the team&#x27;s president and general manager, while Ingle served as vice-president. The two men put together an ownership group that included Evansville&#x27;s leading businessmen and professionals. Evansville&#x27;s mayor, Benjamin Bosse, and the vice-president of City National Bank were included in this group. The city&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce was also heavily involved in promoting the Crimson Giants.

===Merger of the Ex-Collegians and Crimson Giants===
The remaining Ex-Collegians, led by their quarterback and captain, Menz Lindsey, at first refused to join Fausch and Ingle. The Ex-Collegians wanted instead to continue playing independently. However Fausch needed many of those Ex-Collegian players in order to create his new team. He came to an agreement with Guy Morrison, a popular baseball pitcher with the Evansville Evas of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. With Morrison, Fausch arranged for a benefit game that provided funds for the construction of a World War I veterans&#x27; memorial. By doing this, the Crimson Giants secured the exclusive use of the only suitable stadium in Evansville, Bosse Field. Lindsey tried to challenge the Giants to a contest in the benefit game; however, Fausch refused to respond.

Many professional football players soon flooded to the Crimson Giants. Bourbon Bondurant, an insurance agent with prior pro football experience with the Fort Wayne Friars; Joe Windbiel, a local high school coach who played professionally with the Detroit Heralds; architect Earl Warweg, who had played semi-pro football for five years in Indianapolis; cigar company traffic manager Clarence Specht; and June Talley, an insurance adjuster also with college football experience, soon joined the team.

After finding no other venue in which to play in Evansville, many of the Ex-Collegians joined the Crimson Giants. Soon, Doc Gorman joined the Crimson Giants, becoming the first Ex-Collegian, other than Fausch and Ingle, to defect. Within a week, Lindsey and Clarence Spiegel, two main pillars of the Ex-Collegians&#x27; organization, jumped to the Crimson Giants.

===The NFL===
On August 27, 1921, Fausch traveled to Chicago to secure an American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922) franchise for Evansville. It was then that Evansville was awarded an APFA franchise that was scheduled to begin play in 1921.

====1921 season====
The Crimson Giants won five of their first seven games. The team&#x27;s first-ever league win came at home on October 2, 1921, as the Crimson Giants defeated the Louisville Brecks, 21–0. The team&#x27;s second league win can a week later against the Muncie Flyers, 14–0. However, the Crimson Giants lost to the Hammond Pros, 3–0, the very next week. That win was Hammond&#x27;s first win in the league. During that game, Herb Henderson later stated that the Hammond players met with him during the game and asked if he could tone down his hits because the Hammond players still needed to be healthy for work on Monday. Henderson, a high school football coach, refused and stated that he needed to show his players, who were sitting in the stands watching him, &quot;how tackling was done.&quot;

However, the team lost a lot of money when it suffered through a series of scheduling mishaps in the second half of November. As a result of the eleven games originally scheduled, only five were actually played. Furthermore, only half of the ten games ultimately played by the Giants were against league opponents. In early November, the Crimson Giants travelled to Green Bay, Wisconsin, to face the APFA&#x27;s Green Bay Packers at Hagemeister Park. Although Fausch intended to play every game in Evansville, he chose at this point to receive a guaranteed sum from the Packers&#x27; organization rather than risk losing more money at Bosse Field, where attendance had been disappointing. With several players unable to leave Evansville for the weekend, Fausch found replacements, but the revamped Crimson Giants were defeated in Green Bay, 43–6.

Fausch then scheduled a pair of non-league opponents. The first game, which was to take place in Chicago, was cancelled due to heavy snow, while the other game was cancelled by the opposing team. Fausch quickly added a game against the Cincinnati Celts. However, when faced with poor field conditions and two days of heavy rain, Fausch made a last-minute cancellation. Rather than play before another small crowd and lose more money, he decided not to play at all.

The Crimson Giants had now cancelled their last three games, one of which was to be played on Thanksgiving Day, the biggest football day of the year. As a result, the players received no money, and Fausch had to pay rent for an unused Bosse Field.

Fausch made sure the next game would be played. The Cincinnati Celts were rescheduled and Fausch informed the press that the game would be played &quot;rain or shine.&quot; He then stated that three more games, two against APFA opponents, would be played in Evansville. The Celts game was played on Bosse Field, which was damaged due to heavy rains. The Crimson Giants won their sixth game of the season, 48–0; however, the team still took a financial loss due to poor attendance. A scoreless tie against a non-APFA opponent, two weeks later, ended the 1921 season for the Crimson Giants.

===Committee of Five===
Many of the Crimson Giants&#x27; players became upset with management of the team under Fausch after the 1921 season. It was then that several members of the team took matters into their own hands. The &quot;Committee of Five&quot;, led by former Ex-Collegians Menz Lindsey and Clarence Spiegel, forced Fausch to surrender management of the team. The &quot;Committee of Five&quot; could not reverse the Crimson Giants&#x27; financial fortunes. The Committee lost money in its only contests. Fausch and his American Football Association corporation lost an estimated $10,000 over the course of the season, despite playing a total of nine games at home and only one on the road. To combat the &quot;Committee of Five&quot;, Fausch asserted publicly that it was he who held the franchise rights in the American Professional Football Association, and thus owned the Crimson Giants. To help improve the team&#x27;s finances, he suggested that he would play every Crimson Giants game on the road.

However Fausch lost his players. Several former Giants announced they would play for the local Knights of Columbus squad instead. Menz Lindsey then re-formed the Ex-Collegians and named Herb Henderson the team&#x27;s coach. Lindsey&#x27;s club then secured the financial backing of the Evansville Baseball Fans&#x27; Association. Johnny Nee, manager of the Evanston Evas, became the team&#x27;s business manager. The team was dubbed the Fans&#x27; Association team.

Fausch attended the APFA&#x27;s meeting in Columbus, Ohio, and posted a $1,000 bond to secure his claim to the franchise. It was at this meeting that Chicago Bears owner George Halas suggested that the APFA be renamed the NFL. The Crimson Giants&#x27; membership in the NFL meant that the Fans&#x27; Association team could not play league teams. Thus, they would be forced to play teams that were considered second-rate opponents. However, the Fans&#x27; Association team had secured an exclusive lease to Bosse Field for the entire football season, leaving the Crimson Giants with no park for the 1922 season. The Fans&#x27; Association team also signed many key players from the 1921 Crimson Giants team. Around this time, Johnny Nee renamed the Fans&#x27; Association team the Evansville Pros and attempted to schedule games against the Hammond Pros, Dayton Triangles, and the Louisville Brecks. However, a letter from NFL president Joseph Carr stated that Nee&#x27;s Evansville Pros were not members of the NFL and NFL league clubs would only be allowed to play Fausch&#x27;s Crimson Giants.

====1922 season====
The Crimson Giants played their first three games of the season on the road. Fausch, in the meantime, had hoped that the Evansville Pros would fold in October, so that he could regain the rights to Bosse Field. The Pros folded after witnessing poor attendance and an 0–1–1 record. As a result, Fausch entered into negotiations with Nee over the sale of the lease for Bosse Field. However, the negotiations between the two clubs broke down and the Crimson Giants cancelled their remaining home games. The team only played three games in 1922, all on the road. The Crimson Giants lost all three of those games, to the Toledo Maroons, Rock Island Independents and Louisville Brecks.

The wins by the Brecks and Maroons became the first in Louisville and Toledo franchise history. Meanwhile, the Rock Island Independents became only the second team with two 100-yard rushers in their 60–0 win over Evansville. Jimmy Conzelman ran for five touchdowns during that game, setting an NFL record that remained in place until 1929, when Ernie Nevers scored 40 points alone against the Chicago Bears. The Independents also became the first NFL team to rush for 300 yards in that Evansville game, with 66 carries for 396 yards. The Crimson Giants had the ball for only 26 plays, and seven of those were punts.

===End of the Crimson Giants===
Fausch talked briefly about re-organizing a new Crimson Giants club for the 1923 season; however, he never made an effort to restart the team. Several of the Crimson Giants went on to play professional football for other NFL teams. While the Evansville Crimson Giants were the only league team to go under between the end of the 1922 season and the beginning of the 1923 season, few teams other than the Bears saw profits from football.

==Social make up of the Evansville teams==
The Crimson Giants relied more on outside talent than did their predecessors, the Ex-Collegians. 17 of the Crimson Giants&#x27; 30 players in 1921 were from Evansville, but by 1922, only five of the team&#x27;s 17 players were locals. In contrast, 22 of 23 players on the 1920 Ex-Collegians were from Evansville. When faced with competition from the Giants in 1921, the Ex-Collegians brought in a few outsiders before folding, but generally, semi-pro teams spent little effort on recruiting. Both the Ex-Collegians and the Crimson Giants relied almost exclusively on players with college experience. Both teams consisted overwhelmingly of players from middle class backgrounds. Only a few blue collar workers played professional football in Evansville in the early 1920s. Of every player whose occupation could be determined, almost all of them were white-collar workers. The 1921 Crimson Giants included three lawyers, one physician, and one dentist. It is believed that the blue collars workers were excluded from football in Evansville due to a lack of leisure time.

<text>The Los Angeles Buccaneers were a traveling team in the National Football League (NFL) during the 1926 season, ostensibly representing the city of Los Angeles, California. Like the Los Angeles Wildcats of the first American Football League, the team never actually played a league game in Los Angeles. It was operated out of Chicago with players from California colleges (or who grew up in California).

The historian Michael McCambridge has stated that the Buccaneers originally planned to play in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and became a road team only after the Coliseum Commission refused to allow pro teams to play there. However, the difficulty of transcontinental travel in the era before modern air travel must have been a major factor in the decision to base the team in the Midwest, especially considering there were numerous other stadiums large enough to accommodate an NFL team (the Rose Bowl and Wrigley Field of Los Angeles being among them) had the league desired to pursue that route. Despite being rejected by the Coliseum, the Buccaneers did play two true home games in Los Angeles, both of them exhibition games against the AFL&#x27;s New York Yankees in January 1927. The Buccaneers also played two games in San Francisco, including the last game of the Buccaneers&#x27; existence, an exhibition game against the Wildcats, with the Buccaneers being shut out, 17–0, on January 23, 1927. Because of this, the NFL officially considers the team&#x27;s home city to be Los Angeles.

<doc id="239750" wikidata="Q953800" url="?curid=239750" title="Muncie Flyers">
<text>The Muncie Flyers, known as the Congerville Flyers for most of their existence, were a professional American football team from Muncie, Indiana, that played from 1905 to 1926. The Flyers were an independent squad for most of their existence, but are remembered mostly for their very brief stint in the American Professional Football Association (later known as the National Football League). With only three official league games, one in 1920 and two in 1921, the Flyers are the third-shortest-lived team in league history, behind the two games of the original New York Giants and the one game of the Tonawanda Kardex Lumbermen, and the shortest by a team not from the state of New York.

==History==

===Origins===
The origins of the team show that it evolved from the Congerville (Muncie) Athletic Club, which dates back to at least 1905. Local newspapers provided spotty coverage of the team. An occasional reference was made to a game being scheduled and sometimes the game results with a brief game account were in the Monday paper. In 1910, the Congerville Athletic Club finished with a 10–0–1 record, outscoring their opponents 145–0. All of the home games were played against other local Muncie teams, while the road games were played in nearby Hartford City, Dunkirk, and Alexandria. In 1916, the Congerville Athletic Club team and the Congerville Flyers team merged and Muncie was represented by the Congerville Flyers.

===The Flyers===
The Congerville Muncie Flyers evolved from a team called the Congerville Thirds. This team was later renamed the Congerville Flyers. The 1915 edition of the Flyers proved to be a respectable team, finishing with a 5–3–3 record. Their star player was local player Cooney Checkeye. Playing all its games on the road, the 1916 Flyers had a disappointing year, finishing with a 2–6–1 record. Also representing Congerville in 1915 and 1916 was the Congerville Eagles. This lightweight team was closely associated with the Flyers, sometimes lending the heavyweight team a player or two when they were short due to injuries.

===World War I===
The Congerville Flyers played briefly in 1917, but they did not field a team in 1918 due to the United States involvement in World War I and the influenza epidemic. In September 1917, Earl Ball announced that he had organized a team. Scheduled to be on this team were famous college players: Dick Abrel of Purdue and Al Feeney of Notre Dame. Also scheduled to play was Christian Chambers, formerly of the Fort Wayne Friars. The team was to be led by local hero Cooney Checkaye. Ball invited ten more players to come to practice the next morning. However, a week later, on September 9, Ball announced that he had released all the players he had signed and that he would not be fielding a team due to the war. The local press was convinced that had Muncie fielded this team, it would have no doubt been strong contenders for the state championship.

===The NFL era===
With the war ended, football came back to life in eastern Indiana. The Flyers played some strong teams, including the Wabash Athletic Association, Fort Wayne War Vets, and Cincinnati Celts. The 1919 team finished with a 4–1–1 record. In 1920, the Flyers were one of the original 14 teams in the American Professional Football Association, which later became the National Football League. In the second ever NFL game, the Rock Island Independents destroyed the Muncie Flyers 45–0. The following week, the Decatur Staleys canceled their game with the Flyers. Muncie found it difficult to schedule another game. While the team was idle, most of its players signed to play with other local teams. The Flyers did have a game scheduled against the Dayton Triangles on November 7, 1920, but that game was rained out. The Flyers came back in late November and early December and won three non-APFA games, finishing with a 3–1–0 overall (0–1–0 APFA) record. Returning to the APFA in 1921, the Flyers opened the season by crushing the non-APFA Elwood Legion, then lost league games against the Evansville Crimson Giants, and, at home, against the Cincinnati Celts. They were scheduled to play on November 13, 1921, against the Green Bay Packers, but that game was canceled, leaving the Flyers with a 1–2–0 overall (0–2–0 APFA) record. The Flyers&#x27; mark in APFA football was an unimpressive 0–3–0. But during 1920 and 1921, the Flyers posted a 4–0–0 mark against non-APFA teams. Including 1919, the Flyers posted an 8–1–1 record against non-APFA teams.

===Post-NFL===
After leaving the APFA, the Muncie Flyers reverted to their original name of the Congerville Flyers. Due to weak fan support, the Flyers played almost all their games on the road from in 1922, 1923, and 1924. The Flyers did play one home game, in 1924, that was against the &quot;Notre Dame Reserves of Brownson Hall&quot;. The Flyers lost 47–0. Some speculate that the team they played was not really reserves from Notre Dame, but the strong South Bend Arrows. During those three years, the road-bound Flyers finished with a respectable 10–8–3 record. In 1925, the Flyers could not find a home field in Muncie, so they based their team out of neighboring Jonesboro. The team was referred to as the Jonesboro Flyers and played 9 of 11 games in Jonesboro, finishing with a 6–2–3 record.

<doc id="239754" wikidata="Q6689455" url="?curid=239754" title="Louisville (NFL)">
<text>Louisville, Kentucky had two professional American football teams in the National Football League: the Louisville Breckenridges (or Brecks for short) from 1921 to 1924 and the Louisville Colonels in 1926.

The NFL intended for the Brecks to be a traveling team, however the team played a series of &quot;home&quot; games. All Brecks home games were played at Eclipse Park, until the stadium caught fire and burned to the ground on November 20, 1922. Meanwhile, the Colonels played all of their games on the road. While the Colonels were really a traveling team out of Chicago they are usually accepted as a continuation of the Brecks franchise.

==Louisville Brecks (1899–1924)==
The Brecks dated their beginnings back to 1899. Officially the name of the team was the Louisville Breckenridge Club. The club was located in Louisville at corner of Fifth and St. Catherine Streets at what was then the city&#x27;s perimeter. The &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; reported in 1922 that the Brecks dated &quot;back fifteen years, springing from a boys neighborhood team, the Floyds and Brecks, that has kept itself intact probably longer than any independent team in the country.&quot; At first the team was considered an amateur team, made up of mostly neighborhood boys. However, by 1919, the team was considered professional, although evidently still made up of local players.

The team&#x27;s first ever professional football game was held on November 16, 1919. The game resulted in a 17–0 Brecks victory over the New Albany Calumets. That win allowed the Brecks to claim the mythical &quot;Falls Cities&quot; title. While a champion was declared, no &quot;league&quot; existed at this time.

===The NFL===
Brecks owner, Aaron Hertzman, sent a $25 franchise fee to the NFL on February 21, 1921. The Official NFL Encyclopedia confirms that although officials from Louisville failed to attend the April 1921 league meeting, the NFL did receive a letter requesting a franchise from the Breckenridges. As a result, Hertzman beat out many of the other professional and semi-pro football teams in the Louisville area. In 1920, there were at least nine independent teams in the area, including the Brecks and the Evansville Ex-Collegians.

NFL President Joseph Carr liked the idea of having professional football in cities with strong baseball traditions. This may answer why he granted Hertzman and the Brecks their franchise in 1921. Unlike today, the announcement of Louisville being granted an NFL franchise, was widely ignored by the Louisville press. However, in 1920, only a little attention had been paid the league.

The Brecks were one of eight teams that joined the NFL (then called the American Professional Football Association) in 1921. Carr had intended to use the Brecks a traveling team to fill in open dates in the schedules of the more &quot;established&quot; teams. However, the Brecks did not operate like one. The team played only two league games in 1921, one at home and one on the road, hardly justify the Brecks as a road team. But they were all Louisville born or raised in Louisville. And unlike most road teams, the Brecks&#x27; two league games were not with established teams but with the struggling Evansville Crimson Giants and the Columbus Panhandles, another road team.

Hertzman managed the Brecks. The team played split schedules between league games and local, independent games.

====1921 season====
They lost their first league game to the Evansville Crimson Giants on October 2, 1921. Reports estimated that the game drew more than 2,000 spectators. The games proceeds went to a fund to erect a memorial to the first Indiana soldier to die in World War I. The Brecks next six games were played at Eclipse Park against independent teams. During those six games, the Brecks finished with a 4–2 record. A November 6, 1921 a game with the Cincinnati Celts was canceled, because the Celts could not fulfill the contract.

The Brecks didn&#x27;t play another APFA team until December 4. That game resulted in a 6–0 loss to the Columbus Panhandles in Louisville, due to a late game touchdown pass. The Brecks lost their only two league games in 1921, however they did manage to finish with an overall record of 4–4–1. Karl Hower, played in 1921 for his hometown team.

====1922 season====
The Brecks home schedule included only games with other road teams. However, the Brecks played a series of tough opponents on the road. The team lost on the road to the eventual 1922 NFL Champion Canton Bulldogs 38–0 and the Toledo Maroons 39–0. The very next game featured the worst loss in franchise history as the Brecks were defeated by the Racine Legion 59–0.

Louisville&#x27;s first NFL victory didn&#x27;t come until November 22, 1922. During that game, the Brecks defeated the Crimson Giants, 13–6. This game also proved to be the only game in which the Brecks scored.

However, the Brecks experienced tragedy a few days later, when Eclipse Park caught fire and burned to the ground. The team&#x27;s remaining two games were then cancelled. Had Eclipse Park not burned down, forcing cancellation of the final two games, the team would probably have financially broken even.

====1923 season====
After the destruction of Eclipse Park, the Brecks decided to play their home games of the 1923 season at the newly constructed Parkway Field. In order for the team to bring the Akron Pros, Columbus Panhandles, or Oorang Indians to Louisville, the Brecks announced the sale of season tickets. However, the 1923 season began in the same manner as the previous year, with a 37–0 loss to Canton. The following week saw a 34–0 loss at Columbus. Meanwhile, the Brecks home opener against Akron was cancelled due to poor ticket sales. The Breck did manage to play the Oorang Indians in Louisville, for the team&#x27;s very last NFL game. The Indians were an all-Native American football team, created by, owner Walter Lingo to promote the sale of his airedale terriers. The game included pre-game entertainment and the very first halftime shows. The Indians roster also included Jim Thorpe. The Brecks lost the game 12–0.

====1924 season====
The Brecks finished their last season of football in 1924 as members of the Fall Cities Football Federation and compiled a 2–3 record. The Brecks felt Alumni Field was &quot;more suitable&quot; to their schedule and moved their home games to the field in 1924. Meanwhile, Aaron Hertzman, the owner of the now defunct Brecks, was elected the NFL&#x27;s Sergeant of Arms.

==Louisville Colonels (1926)==
The Louisville Colonels were created in 1926 to fill the schedules of the expanded NFL, but they were a traveling team that operated out of Chicago. That season, the NFL added several semi-pro teams to their ranks, mostly to keep them out of the rival American Football League. While the Colonels were really a traveling team out of Chicago, they are usually accepted as a continuation of the Brecks franchise. Bill Harley, the former owner of the Toledo Maroons, was granted the right to manage the Louisville Colonel operation out of Chicago, while Hertzman still owned the team.

The Colonels failed to register a single point during the 1926 season, one of a very small number of organized teams to have suffered such an ignonomy. The team&#x27;s first game resulted in a 13–0 loss to the Canton Bulldogs, while their second game resulted in a 47–0 loss to the Detroit Panthers. Louisville&#x27;s final two NFL games came on November 7, 1926 (Chicago Bears 34, Louisville Colonels 0) and November 14, 1926 (Green Bay Packers 14, Louisville Colonels 0).

The Brecks-Colonels franchise is the last team from the four currently extant major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada to play its home games in Kentucky, although the Kentucky Colonels played in the American Basketball Association from 1967 until the ABA-NBA merger brought the ABA into the National Basketball Association after the 1975–76 season. Only five of 38 different players played NFL football outside of Louisville.

<text>The New York Yankees were a short-lived professional American football team from 1926 to 1929. The team was a member of the first American Football League in 1926, and later the National Football League from 1927 to 1929. They played their home games at Yankee Stadium. The team featured Red Grange at halfback.

==History==

===Challenge to the NFL===
The Yankees arose as a result of a contract dispute between Grange and his previous team, the NFL&#x27;s Chicago Bears. During the early 1920s, Grange was the star attraction for the Bears, and his play had done a lot to promote the fledgling NFL. However Red&#x27;s agent C. C. &quot;Cash and Carry&quot; Pyle challenged the Bears owner George Halas in 1926, by stating that Red&#x27;s contract was owned by himself, and not Halas. Pyle then approached Halas to demand for Grange a generous salary and one-third ownership of the Bears. Halas refused.

Pyle then took his quest for an NFL franchise to the NFL&#x27;s 1926 winter meeting. There he showed to the other owners that he had the rights to Grange. As a result, he wanted an NFL team of his own and he wanted it in New York City&#x27;s Yankee Stadium. If he would be denied, Pyle threatened to start his own league. However a market in the New York market was not available. Tim Mara held exclusive NFL rights to the New York Giants. Mara had just struggled through his first year as an owner, and was saved from financial disaster ironically by Grange&#x27;s exhibition appearance. Nearing the end of their first season, the Giants had gone largely unnoticed by New York fans and newspapers, and Giants&#x27; owner Tim Mara was deeply in the red. But Grange&#x27;s appearance drew 73,000 people to the Polo Grounds; in one afternoon Mara was in the black financially, and professional football had gained new respect among New York&#x27;s influential sportswriters. Now Pyle wanted to take away half of Mara&#x27;s market.

===Brooklyn compromise===
The other franchise owners backed Mara, however they did not want to lose Grange and his drawing power. They were well aware of what a game against Grange could mean to their finances. They were also aware that Pyle might actually carry out a threat to start a new league if they refused his request. As a result, the league proposed a compromise. It was proposed that Pyle could have his &quot;New York&quot; franchise but it would be located in Brooklyn, which was a part of New York City. However Pyle had already gone ahead and rented Yankee Stadium, and that was where he intended to play. Rejecting the NFL&#x27;s offer, he set out to make good on his threat. With his new New York Yankees franchise as its flagship, Pyle put together a league called the American Football League.

===1926 season===
Once the league was under way, Grange lived up to his reputation and drew well wherever he played. 22,000 spectators turned out in Philadelphia to watch the Yankees play the Philadelphia Quakers. In comparison, an NFL game a week later in the same stadium between the Frankford Yellow Jackets and the New York Giants drew only 10,000. Nevertheless, the American league folded at the end of the season, but Pyle&#x27;s Yankees were given the franchise in the National league for which they originally asked.

=== NFL and Decline ===

While the bulk of the AFL disappeared with the demise of the league, two of its members had an official existence after the 1926 season. Although the Brooklyn Horsemen disbanded after its last NFL game, the team&#x27;s franchise was never withdrawn or canceled by the league. New York Giants owner Tim Mara was awarded the Horsemen franchise in payment of a debt and proceeded to lease it to C. C. Pyle for his New York Yankees team. The agreement between the two rivals limited the number of home games that the Yankees were permitted to play in its namesake stadium (four in 1927) and forced to be primarily a road team displaying the talents of Red Grange. This arrangement lasted for three years: the Yankees were no more after the 1929 season. Grange played for the Yankees in 1927, however he sat out the next season with a bad leg, and then returned to the Bears where he played until 1934. He then coached the Bears from 1942 until 1948.

<text>The Berenstain Bears is a children&#x27;s literature franchise created by Stan and Jan Berenstain and continued by their son, Mike Berenstain. The books feature a family of anthropomorphic grizzly bears who generally learn a moral or safety-related lesson in the course of each story.

Since the 1962 debut of the first Berenstain Bears book, &quot;The Big Honey Hunt&quot;, the series has grown to over 400 titles, which have sold approximately 260 million copies in 23 languages. The Berenstain Bears franchise has also expanded well beyond the books, encompassing television series and a wide variety of other products and licenses. While enjoying decades of popularity and receiving numerous awards, the series has been criticized for its perceived saccharine tone and formulaic storytelling.

==History==

Stanley Berenstain and Janice Grant met in 1941, on their first day of drawing class at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art, where they formed an immediate bond. After being separated during World War II, during which Stan served in the Army as a medical illustrator and Janice worked as a drafter for the United States Army Corps of Engineers and an aircraft riveter, they were reunited and married in 1946. While initially working as art teachers, the Berenstains pursued a joint career in cartooning and gradually found success working together on illustrations, humorous sketches and cover art for publications including &quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. In 1951, they published &quot;Berenstains&#x27; Baby Book&quot;, a humorous how-to aimed at adults and based on their experiences raising their infant son Leo in downtown Philadelphia. Nearly two dozen other books followed; described by Stan as &quot;cartoon essays&quot;, the titles included &quot;Marital Blitz&quot;, &quot;How To Teach Your Children About Sex Without Making A Complete Fool of Yourself&quot;, and &quot;Have A Baby, My Wife Just Had A Cigar!&quot;

In the early 1960s, the Berenstains sought to enter the field of writing for young children. For their first children&#x27;s book, they chose to cast bears as the main characters, primarily because &quot;bears are furry and appealing.&quot; Stan also observed that female bears are &quot;terrifyingly good mothers&quot; while the males are &quot;lousy fathers&quot;. (The Berenstains did not consider the similarity to their last name in making the choice) In their 2002 memoir, they said that they knew from the start that their book would &quot;have three characters: a bluff, overenthusiastic Papa Bear who wore bib overalls and a plaid shirt and ...a wise Mama Bear who wore a blue dress with white polka dots ... and a bright, lively little cub.&quot;

The Berenstains&#x27; first bear story, titled &quot;Freddy Bear&#x27;s Spanking&quot;, arrived on the desk of Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, who had found phenomenal success in 1957 with &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and was now editor of a Random House series called &quot;Beginner Books&quot;. Geisel took on the manuscript, but spent the next two years ruthlessly challenging the Berenstains to make improvements to the writing and structure and to connect with their characters on a deeper level. He asked questions such as &quot;What kind of pipe tobacco does Papa Bear smoke?&quot; and urged them to analyze the relationship between Papa Bear and Small Bear, to which Stan responded, mystified, &quot;Well, he&#x27;s the father, and he&#x27;s the son&quot;; however, Jan attributed the inspiration for the characters&#x27; dynamic to the 1931 film &quot;The Champ&quot;.
The book was finally published in 1962 under the title &quot;The Big Honey Hunt&quot;, with no plans to revisit the bears in a sequel. Geisel had told the Berenstains to feature a different animal in their next story, as &quot;there are already too many bears ... Sendak&#x27;s got some kind of bear. There&#x27;s Yogi Bear, the Three Bears, Smokey Bear, the Chicago Bears ... for your next book you should do something as different from bears as possible.&quot; They had started work on a new project featuring a penguin when Geisel called and told them: &quot;We&#x27;re selling the hell out of the bear book.&quot; The second bear book, &quot;The Bike Lesson&quot;, appeared in 1964, featuring the names Stan and Jan Berenstain instead of Stanley and Janice; Geisel had changed the credit without consulting them. Geisel was also responsible for adding the name &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; to the covers of the book.

Over the next several decades, Stan and Jan collaborated on hundreds of books from their home studio outside Philadelphia. After developing a storyline together, one of them (usually Stan) would develop a first draft, which the other would then refine into an 1100-word manuscript. They also worked together on the illustrations. In 2002, the couple released a memoir of their career titled &quot;Down A Sunny Dirt Road&quot;.

Their sons Leo and Mike also entered the family business. Mike became a published author and illustrator starting in 1976, and Leo published a book of short stories in 1992. In the 1990s, the men worked on the Berenstain Bears &quot;Big Chapter Book&quot; series (published under the names Stan and Jan Berenstain). Following Stan&#x27;s death from lymphoma in 2005, Mike collaborated with his mother on writing and illustrating Berenstain Bears installments, while Leo has been involved with the business side of the franchise. Jan Berenstain died in February 2012 following a stroke. Mike Berenstain continues to write and illustrate new books in the series and has incorporated faith-based themes in recent years.

==Characters and themes==

The Berenstain Bears, who reside &quot;in a big treehouse down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country&quot;, consists of Papa Bear, an over-eager, bumbling carpenter; wise Mama Bear, a housewife and perfectionist; and their children, Brother Bear (originally Small Bear), and later additions Sister Bear and Honey Bear. Sister Bear was introduced in the 1974 book &quot;The Berenstain Bears&#x27; New Baby.&quot; Honey Bear&#x27;s imminent arrival was announced in early 2000 in &quot;The Birds, the Bees, and the Berenstain Bears&quot;, along with a reader contest to name the new bear; her birth was featured later that year in &quot;The Berenstain Bears and Baby Makes Five&quot;.

The early Beginner Books about the bears generally follow a basic formula, so described by the Berenstains: &quot;Papa sets out to instruct Small Bear in some aspect of the art of living and ends up badly the worse for wear, with Small Bear expressing his appreciation for the fine lesson Papa has taught him.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Paul Farhi, &quot;The action usually starts when the kids face a problem. They turn to Papa, who offers a &quot;solution&quot; that only makes the problem—or the kids&#x27; fears about it—even worse. Enter Mama, who eventually sets everyone straight.&quot;

The litany of issues confronted by the Berenstain Bears over their fifty years of publication includes bullying, messiness, poor sportsmanship, visiting the dentist, online safety, and childhood obesity, among countless others. The Berenstains often drew inspiration from their own family experiences, which Stan credited for the series&#x27; continued relevance: &quot;Kids still tell fibs and they mess up their rooms and they still throw tantrums in the supermarket ... Nobody gets shot. No violence. There are problems, but they&#x27;re the kind of typical family problems everyone goes through.&quot; The couple also pointed out, in response to criticism of the characterization of Papa and Mama Bear, that the characters were heavily inspired by Stan and Jan Berenstain themselves.

==Books==
==Reception==
The &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; series had sold over 240 million copies by 2003. Of their books, 35 are in the Publishers Weekly top 250 titles of all time, and 15 are in the top 100 children&#x27;s paperbacks. The series has received praise and awards for its contributions to children&#x27;s literature as well as condemnation for promoting outdated gender roles, simplistic and unrealistic messages, and not keeping up with the times.

===Criticism===
Critics of the series have called it &quot;syrupy&quot;, &quot;unsatisfying&quot;, &quot;infuriatingly formulaic&quot;, &quot;hokey&quot;, &quot;abominable&quot;, and &quot;little more than stern lectures dressed up as children&#x27;s stories&quot;.

Upon the death of Stan Berenstain in 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an &quot;Appreciation&quot; piece which many &quot;Post&quot; readers found surprisingly unappreciative in its tone. Written by Paul Farhi, who had previously rebuked the Berenstain Bears as the most popular example of a lamentable and misguided &quot;self-help&quot; genre aimed at children, the 2005 piece revived his earlier sentiments:

Subsequent letters from readers condemned Farhi for expressing such harshness toward the recently deceased; one wrote, &quot;In the name of fairness, please be sure to allow the Berenstain family the opportunity to someday retort in Farhi&#x27;s obituary.&quot; Readers also defended the books&#x27; &quot;warmth&quot; and their enduring popularity among young children.

&quot;Slate&quot;″s Hanna Rosin drew criticism for the writing of Jan Berenstain&#x27;s death, &quot;As any right-thinking mother will agree, good riddance. Among my set of mothers the series is known mostly as the one that makes us dread the bedtime routine the most.&quot; (Rosin subsequently apologized and admitted she &quot;was not really thinking of [Berenstain] as a person with actual feelings and a family, just an abstraction who happened to write these books&quot;.)

===Awards and praise===
The Berenstain Bears series has been awarded the Ludington Award from the Educational Paperback Association for their contribution to children&#x27;s literature, the Drexel Citation from Drexel University, several Philadelphia Literary Children&#x27;s Roundtable Honors, and many other state reading association awards. Following Jan Berenstain&#x27;s death in 2012, acclaimed children&#x27;s author Jerry Spinelli said that &quot;the Berenstains made a wonderful and lasting contribution to children&#x27;s literature&quot;. Author and professor Donna Jo Napoli said, &quot;Those bears have helped so many children through so many kinds of challenges that kids face, in such a cheerful and kind of energetic way.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Alexandra Petri wrote that the books were &quot;timeless, timely, and kind-hearted, like all the best literature&quot;, and acknowledged the &quot;Post&quot;″s 1989 piece by saying, &quot;This is one of the times the kids have the right idea and Charles Krauthammer does not.&quot;

==Franchise==
Since the Berenstain Bears&#x27; creation, the characters have been widely licensed for a broad array of products. The franchise exploded in size in the 1980s, when King Features began aggressively promoting the Bears to marketers amidst a surge in popularity following a series of animated television specials. As of 1983, the Berenstain Bears had been licensed to approximately 40 companies for more than 150 types of products, with projected annual sales of $50 million.

===Television===

The Berenstain Bears first appeared on television in five animated specials on NBC, airing as follows:
* &quot;The Berenstain Bears&#x27; Christmas Tree&quot; (December 3, 1979)
* &quot;The Berenstain Bears Meet Bigpaw&quot; (November 20, 1980)
* &quot;The Berenstain Bears&#x27; Easter Surprise&quot; (April 14, 1981)
* &quot;The Berenstain Bears&#x27; Valentine Special&quot; (promotional title) (broadcast as &quot;The Berenstain Bears&#x27; Comic Valentine&quot; and released on home video as &quot;The Berenstain Bears and Cupid&#x27;s Surprise&quot;) (February 13, 1982)
* &quot;The Berenstain Bears&#x27; Littlest Leaguer&quot; (also called &quot;The Berenstain Bears Play Ball&quot;) (May 6, 1983)
The first special starred Ron McLarty, Gabriela Glatzer, Jonathan Lewis, and Pat Lysinger as Papa, Sister, Brother and Mama, respectively. Most reprised their roles in the subsequent specials.

From 1985 through 1987, an animated series titled &quot;The Berenstain Bears Show&quot; aired as part of CBS&#x27; Saturday-morning cartoon block. The series was nominated in 1987 for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children&#x27;s Programming; it was also nominated that year for a Humanitas Prize in the category of Non-Prime Time Children&#x27;s Animated Show.

A second TV series, also called &quot;The Berenstain Bears&quot;, debuted on PBS in 2002. The series was produced by the Canadian company Nelvana and consisted of 40 30-minute episodes adapted from the books. However, the series are considered separate adaptations and were never aired together. Even though the 2002 series is not a remake but a continuation of the episodes, some characters&#x27; personalities changed while other characters no longer appeared. (However, new characters appeared.) The original specials and TV series have a rustic design and interaction with other forest animals, while the Nelvana series completely embraced rural life with slower timing. Although Canadian laws required Nelvana to employ only Canadian writers and artists, the Berenstains provided detailed reviews of each script. They also sought to exert their influence on some details, according to Stan. &quot;Our bears don&#x27;t wear shoes, and Papa wouldn&#x27;t wear his hat in the house ... And we try to keep complete, total banality out of the stories.&quot; Common practicalities of animation did force some minor costume changes from the books, such as eliminating polka dots and plaids. (This issue also occurred in previous animated series and specials. Only a limited amount of polka dots was allowed in the five specials.) The show&#x27;s theme song is performed by Lee Ann Womack.

In 2011, 20 episodes of the Nelvana series were dubbed in the Native American Lakota language and began airing on public television in North and South Dakota under the title (&quot;The Compassionate Bear Family&quot;). The translated series was a collaboration of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and the nonprofit Lakota Language Consortium, with Mike Berenstain and Nelvana waiving all licensing fees for the venture. &quot;The Berenstain Bears&quot; is the first animated series to be translated into a Native American language in the United States.

===Software and video games===
Several computer games and other software adaptations of the &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; books have been released, including the following:

In late 2002, an exhibit titled &quot;The Berenstain Bears Celebrate: The Art of Stan and Jan Berenstain&quot; opened at the James A. Michener Art Museum in the Berenstains&#x27; home of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Organized by the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and timed to coincide with the release of the Berenstains&#x27; memoir &quot;Down A Sunny Dirt Road&quot;, the exhibit provided a retrospective of the couple&#x27;s artwork, influences and techniques, as well as the evolution of their famous bears. The exhibit was subsequently hosted by the Rockwell Museum in 2003.

In 2005, the Lied Discovery Children&#x27;s Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada, opened &quot;Growing Up With the Berenstain Bears&quot;, an exhibition offering children the chance to experience life-size versions of Bear Country landmarks. The Youth Museum Exhibit Collaborative and the Berenstains themselves assisted in the exhibit&#x27;s development. The exhibition visited eight other museums in the United States and Canada before returning to Lied Discovery Children&#x27;s Museum in 2010.

The National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, is host to a permanent exhibit, &quot;The Berenstain Bears – Down a Sunny Dirt Road&quot;. Opened in 2008, the original exhibition features interactive 3D playsets such as Mama Bear&#x27;s Quilt Shop, Papa Bear&#x27;s Woodworking Shop, and Dr. Bearson&#x27;s Dentist Office.

===Stage show===
The off-Broadway musical &quot;The Berenstain Bears LIVE! in Family Matters, the Musical&quot; debuted in June 2011 at MMAC (Manhattan Movie and Arts Center) in New York City, after having toured the country in an earlier version. Originally scheduled to run from June to September 4, the show was extended through October and subsequently moved to the Marjorie S. Deane Little Theatre for an open-ended run. The show was produced by &quot;Berenstain&quot; fan &quot;Matt Murphy&quot;, whose previous work included &quot;Memphis&quot; and &quot;Altar Boyz&quot;. &quot;Improper Magazine&quot; called it &quot;a genuinely enjoyable and enriching experience for kids&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;little theatergoers will enjoy the actors&quot; but the story was &quot;a bit too tidy and tame&quot;.

===Cancelled feature film===
A planned &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; feature film adaptation was announced in 2009 by Walden Media and director Shawn Levy, whose company 21 Laps would produce the film. The project was envisioned as a comedy with both live action and animated elements, and an original storyline that would combine details from several &quot;Berenstain&quot; books. &quot;I&#x27;d like the film to be un-ironic about its family connections but have a wry comedic sensibility that isn&#x27;t oblivious to the fact that they&#x27;re bears&quot;, Levy said. Comparing it to the film &quot;Elf&quot;, Levy said he thought the &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; film would be &quot;witty but never sarcastic&quot;. As of January 2012, the project was reportedly in the script phase, but the company&#x27;s option has since expired.

===Social issues===
In 2007, the Berenstain Bears became the &quot;spokesbears&quot; for Prevent Child Abuse America. Said PCA America President and CEO Jim Hmurovich: &quot;This is a great example of a socially conscious and child-focused business taking a stand on an issue that has great consequences for all of us. This helps us begin having a more honest conversation about how each of us has a role to prevent the abuse and neglect of our nation&#x27;s children.&quot;

The Berenstains were approached by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who asked them to write an anti-smoking book for children. They declined, but the idea did lead to a 1988 book about peer pressure, &quot;The Berenstain Bears and the Double Dare&quot;. In 1997, they published &quot;The Berenstain Bear Scouts and the Sinister Smoke Ring&quot;; Florida governor Lawton Chiles purchased 600,000 copies of the book to distribute to children as part of his anti-smoking campaign.

Beginning in 2008, a number of &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; titles of a specifically religious nature have been released by Mike Berenstain. These include &quot;The Berenstain Bears: God Loves You&quot;, &quot;The Berenstain Bears Say Their Prayers&quot; and a &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; Bible – Complete New International Reader&#x27;s Version written at a third-grade reading level. The titles are part of a series called &quot;Living Lights&quot; and are published by the Christian company Zondervan and HarperCollins.

In August 2012, the publishers of the series faced controversy regarding the fast food restaurant Chick-fil-A&#x27;s plan to distribute titles in the series as part of a kids&#x27; meal promotion, with gay rights advocates urging the publishers to pull out of the promotion, due to the Chick-fil-A founder&#x27;s controversial statements regarding same-sex marriage. HarperCollins went ahead with the promotion, stating that it was not their &quot;practice to cancel a contract with an author, or any other party, for exercising their first amendment rights.&quot;

===Other products===
In the 1980s, the prominent vaccine manufacturer Lederle Laboratories licensed the Berenstain Bears for a promotional campaign encouraging children to get vaccinated. As part of the campaign, Lederle distributed Berenstain Bears stuffed animals and books to every pediatrician&#x27;s office in the United States.

In the 1990s and 2000s, many Cedar Fair theme parks, including Cedar Point, featured kids&#x27; play areas called &quot;Berenstain Bear Country&quot; that were themed to the franchise. The Berenstain Bears could also be found at the parks as costumed characters.

A musical album titled &quot;The Berenstain Bears Save Christmas: The Musical!&quot; was released by Good Mood Records in 2006. Adapted from the 2003 book &quot;The Berenstain Bears Save Christmas&quot;, the album teamed the Berenstains with the father-son composing team of Elliot Lawrence and Jamie Broza, the former of whom composed music for the holiday television specials and original television series.

Other products that have featured the Berenstain Bears include clothing, Happy Meals, cereal, chocolate, crackers, greeting cards, puzzles, embroidery kits, and notepads.

==Name confusion==
Many people incorrectly remember the name of the series as the &quot;Berenstein Bears&quot;. This confusion has generated multiple explanations of the memories, including an unannounced name change, time travel, or parallel universes, and has been described as an instance of the Mandela effect. According to Mike Berenstain, confusion over the name has existed since his father&#x27;s childhood, when a teacher told him there was no such name as &quot;Berenstain&quot; and the correct spelling was &quot;Bernstein&quot;. A few examples of the &quot;Berenstein&quot; spelling have been found in references to and knockoffs of official merchandise and publications, and cartoons for the series used an ambiguous pronunciation which may contribute to the false memory.

<doc id="239762" wikidata="Q641567" url="?curid=239762" title="Oorang Indians">
<text>The Oorang Indians () were a traveling team in the National Football League from LaRue, Ohio (near Marion). The franchise was a novelty team put together by Walter Lingo to market his Oorang (Airedale Terrier) dog kennels. All of the Indians players were Native American, with Jim Thorpe serving as its leading player and coach. The team played in the National Football League in 1922 and 1923. Of the 20 games they played over two seasons, only one was played at &quot;home&quot; in nearby Marion. With a population well under a thousand people, LaRue remains the smallest town ever to have been the home of an NFL franchise, or any professional team in any league in the United States.

==History==
===Beginnings===
In 1919 Oorang Kennel owner, Walter Lingo, met and became friends with Jim Thorpe of the Canton Bulldogs, a future Pro Football Hall of Famer who was considered the greatest athlete of his time. Lingo had a deep passion for the Airedales, which he raised, and for Native American culture. LaRue, Ohio, was once the site of an old Wyandot village and Lingo believed that a supernatural bond existed between the Indians and the Airedales. Thorpe first came to Lingo&#x27;s defense after neighboring farmers accused Lingo&#x27;s Oorang Kennels of raising &quot;a nation of sheep killers&quot;. Thorpe came to Lingo&#x27;s aid by testifying that he once knew an Oorang Airedale that had saved the life of a 6-year-old girl, named Mabel, from being trampled by a bull. Afterwards, Lingo and Thorpe became friends and soon began hunting together.

In 1921, Lingo invited Thorpe and Pete Calac, who was a teammate of Thorpe&#x27;s at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, to his plantation in LaRue to hunt for opossum. It was on this trip that the men agreed on a way to both advertise Airedales and to employ Thorpe, who after dominating the Ohio League for much of the late 1910s was no longer to lead his Canton Bulldogs to championships in a broader national league. Lingo would purchase a franchise in the young National Football League, and Thorpe would run the team. At the time, the cost of purchasing an NFL franchise was $100 (). Meanwhile, just one of Lingo&#x27;s Airedales sold for $150 (). Lingo saw the idea of a franchise as a way of touring the country&#x27;s leading cities for the express purpose of advertising his Airedales. Therefore, he placed two conditions on the team. The first was that Thorpe had to field an all-Indian team. Secondly, Lingo wanted the team to help run his kennels in addition to playing football. Thorpe and Calac agreed to both terms. Finally, Thorpe would be paid $500 a week () to coach, play, and manage the kennels.

In June 1922, Lingo, who also served as the team&#x27;s business manager, traveled to Canton, Ohio, and purchased an NFL franchise for $100 (). He named his team the Oorang Indians, after his kennels and favorite breed of dog. The name stood out to sports and dog fans alike. Lingo originally wanted the team to play out of LaRue, but that was hard to justify since the small town was missing a football field. The issue led to the club performing almost exclusively on the road as a traveling team, where it could draw the biggest crowds and best advertise the dogs. However, Thorpe and Lingo also felt that it would be nice to keep the Indians at home once or twice a year. The nearest town with a suitable football field was Marion, Ohio, which served as the location for the Indians&#x27; &quot;home&quot; games. The players would be in a constant state of travel week after week to many of the major cities in the country; such traveling teams were a regular part of professional football, which had a tradition of barnstorming, through its early existence. However, despite the hectic schedule, Lingo later insisted that the Indians received the very best of care. The same dieticians and the same trainer who fed his Airedales and cared for their well-being also tended to the Indian team members.

===Fielding the team===
 Jim Thorpe served as a player-coach and recruited players for the team. In keeping with Lingo&#x27;s wishes that franchise be an all-Indian team, Indians from all over the United States traveled to LaRue to try out for the team. Many of the prospects were from Thorpe&#x27;s alma mater, the Carlisle Indian School. Several of the candidates looking to make the team had not played in years and were older than 40. While many of the members of the team were not full-blooded Indians—Thorpe himself was three-eighths Irish—every identifiable team member has proved to have at least some Indian blood. The Oorang Indians consisted of members who were Cherokee, Mohawk, Chippewa, Blackfeet, Winnebago, Mission, Caddo, Flathead, Sac and Fox, Seneca, and Penobscot. The team roster included such colorful names as Long Time Sleep, Dick Deer Slayer, Woodchuck Welmas, Joe Little Twig, Big Bear, and War Eagle. The team also had four former Carlisle Indians football captains in Thorpe, Joe Guyon, Pete Calac, and Elmer Busch and the Indians&#x27; trainer was John Morrison, reportedly the first Carlisle captain.

Walter Lingo&#x27;s son Bob later recalled that the team practiced every day, depending on the workload at the dog kennel. However, training for an NFL season was only a secondary mission for the players. They did everything at the dog kennels, from training the dogs to building crates to ship them in. They kept in good physical condition, which was more important than an actual practice. Bob Lingo also stated that several of the team&#x27;s plays were made up on the spot, similar to the play-calling in a sandlot football game.

===The 1922 season===
The Indians had two future Hall of Famers on the roster, Thorpe and Joe Guyon. However, they did not play much. Thorpe was confined to coaching on the sidelines through most of the first half of the 1922 season and never played more than a half afterward. Guyon did not join the team until midway through the 1922 season. Pete Calac, who won several &quot;Ohio League&quot; titles with Thorpe and the Canton Bulldogs, was still suffering from career-threatening wounds from fighting in France during World War I.

The Indians began their season with a 3–2 record in their first 5 five games. Both of the team&#x27;s losses came against NFL opponents, the Canton Bulldogs and the Dayton Triangles. Two of their victories came against independent teams and one in the NFL, the perennially bottom-dwelling Columbus Panhandles. One of those games against an independent team, the Indianapolis Belmonts, was played in a snowstorm. The Indians defeated the Belmonts, 33–0, taking home $2,000 () in profits along with a Cherokee tackle named Chief Johnson, whom Thorpe recruited at halftime. A week later the Indians were defeated 62–0 (a “scorigami”, as this has not been the final score of an NFL game since) by the Akron Pros. The team then lost their next three games, all against league opponents: the Minneapolis Marines 13–6, the Chicago Bears 33–6, and the Milwaukee Badgers 13–0. The team did rebound to win their next two games, which were against league opponents, an upset over the Buffalo All-Americans 19–7, and a rematch with Columbus 18–6. However, their last two games ended in losses against independent teams, to finish with a 3–6 record (5–8 overall).

====First-ever halftime shows====
Rather than retiring to the locker room at halftime, the Oorang Indians showed Lingo&#x27;s Airedales to the crowd. It was debatable, though, whether the Indians were there to play football or give Airedale exhibitions at halftime. In addition to the exhibitions with the dogs, the Indians, including Thorpe, participated in helping the Oorang Airedales perform tricks for the crowd. However, it was their halftime entertainment that made them such a huge attraction in the early 1920s. There were shooting exhibitions with the dogs retrieving the targets. There were Indian dances and tomahawk and knife-throwing demonstrations. Thorpe had a history of repeatedly drop kicking footballs through the uprights from midfield. Indians player Nick Lassa (also called &quot;Long-Time-Sleep&quot;) even wrestled a bear on occasion.

====Off-field behavior====

The Indians players knew that Lingo&#x27;s only goal was to advertise his Airedales and that winning football games wasn&#x27;t important to him. Therefore, the players spent a lot of their free time partying and drinking. In 1922, the night before a game with the Chicago Bears, the Indians went to a Chicago bar called &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Saloon.&quot; At 2:00 a.m., the bartender stopped serving drinks since Illinois law prohibited the sale of alcohol after 2 a.m. This action upset the Indians players, who stuffed the bartender in a telephone booth and turned it upside down. The Indians lost to the Bears 33–6 just a few hours later. Another instance occurred in November 1923 in St. Louis (as the Indians were in town for a game against the All-Stars), when several of the Indians went out drinking for the night. As the night came to an end, the players decided it was time to return to their hotel. They soon found a trolley that could take them back to their rooms; however, that particular trolley was headed in the opposite direction. To solve this problem, the Indians players reportedly picked up the trolley, and turned it around on the tracks. They then told the conductor the address for their hotel.

Another reason for the team&#x27;s lack of success, according to Ed Healey, a Hall of Fame tackle for the Chicago Bears, was that Thorpe was not a good coach, especially where discipline was concerned. However, Healey insisted the players were &quot;tough S.O.B.&#x27;s, but good guys off the field.&quot;

===The 1923 season===
The Indians played in the NFL again for the 1923 season, but the team that was fielded was weaker than the one from the year prior. While many of the players had moments of great play, the 1923 Indians were anchored by Thorpe, Guyon, and Calac, though those three players were constantly missing from the line-up due to injury. Guyon did not play until the eighth game of the season against the Canton Bulldogs, and Thorpe suffered a season-ending injury in the team&#x27;s ninth game, against the Columbus Tigers. While Thorpe was still a decent player, he had lost much of the speed that helped him throughout his earlier career.

The team lost all of their first nine games, all against NFL opponents, and were outscored 235–12. The Indians finally won their first game of the season against the independent Marion Athletics, 33–0, before splitting their last two games, a 22–19 loss against the Chicago Cardinals and a 19–0 win over the Louisville Brecks.

===Decline===
At first, the Oorang Indians were an excellent gate attraction. However, most fans knew that the team underperformed; as the fans had already seen the halftime they stayed for the remainder of the game. The novelty soon wore off and Lingo pulled his financial backing. At the end of the 1923 season, the Oorang Indians disbanded. Lingo didn&#x27;t renew the franchise, and it formally folded in 1924.

==Legacy==
In 1997, which was the 75th anniversary of the team&#x27;s founding, the Marion County Historical Society erected an Ohio Historic Marker on the site of the Oorang Indians&#x27; practice field in LaRue, Ohio. Today, LaRue still has the distinction of being the smallest community to have a National Football League franchise. Two members of the Oorang Indians, Jim Thorpe and Joe Guyon, were named as charter members of the National Football League Hall of Fame. Meanwhile, Lingo&#x27;s kennels, which were the sole reason for the team, thrived until 1929, when the industry was impacted by the Great Depression; however, the Oorang Kennel Company continued until Walter Lingo&#x27;s death in 1969. The Indians are also believed to have the highest percentage of Oklahomans on its roster than any other NFL squad before or since. Finally the club was also the first NFL team to have a regular training camp during their short existence.

Lingo revived the Oorang Indians as a basketball team in the late 1920s, again with Jim Thorpe as his star; the basketball version of the Indians is poorly documented.

<text>The Hammond Pros were an American football team from Hammond, Indiana that played in the National Football League from 1920 to 1926 as a traveling team.

==History==
The Pros were established by local businessman Paul Parduhn and Dr. Alva Young. Young, a boxing promoter and owner of a racing stable, also served as doctor/trainer (and part-owner) for a semi-pro football team operated by the Hammond Clabby Athletic Association from 1915 to 1917. In 1918, Young presided over a new team known as the &quot;Hammond All-Stars&quot; and played against many of the teams that would form the backbone of the American Professional Football Association (including the Racine Cardinals, Detroit Heralds, Rock Island Independents, Minneapolis Marines, Cleveland Tigers, Canton Bulldogs, and Toledo Maroons); Young attended the historic meeting in Canton, Ohio at which the APFA was formed in 1920. (It is said that a game between Hammond and Canton, played Thanksgiving Day 1919 and drawing some 12,000 spectators in Chicago, convinced team owners that a league would be viable.)

In 1919, the team starred George Halas at wide receiver; Halas left for the Decatur Staleys – the future Chicago Bears – the following year, remaining with that franchise as a player, coach and owner until his death in 1983.

Despite the name, the Pros were little more than a semi-professional outfit; most of the players were locals who had full-time jobs and couldn&#x27;t practice much, and thus were simply no match for most other NFL squads. Nor did they really represent Hammond, as the town&#x27;s stadium (A. Murray Turner Field) was built for baseball and seated only a few thousand. The Pros would play only two regular-season NFL games in Hammond over their seven years in the league, and would use Cubs Park in Chicago as an unofficial &quot;home&quot; stadium. Nevertheless, Young kept the team going in the NFL for seven years and 34 games, with a combined record of 5–26–4. The Pros might have lasted even longer, but after winning the 1926 battle with the American Football League, the NFL decided to scale down to 12 teams, getting rid of many of the smaller franchises, including the Pros.

Of the nine African-American players in the league during those years, six played for the Pros, including the first African-American head coach in the NFL, Fritz Pollard, and the successful music producer Mayo &quot;Ink&quot; Williams.

<doc id="239764" wikidata="Q6391311" url="?curid=239764" title="Kenosha Maroons">
<text>The Kenosha Maroons were a National Football League football team in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Officially, the club only played in the league during the 1924 season, dissolving after posting no wins in five games.

==History==
===Origins===
Prior to the 1924 season, the NFL ordered the Toledo Maroons, based in Toledo, Ohio to either transfer or suspend operations. Then on September 16, 1924, the &quot;Kenosha Evening News&quot; reported that the City of Kenosha agreed to purchase the Toledo franchise. However no conclusive evidence exists that the Toledo franchise was officially transferred to Kenosha.

Kenosha felt that the team would be successful under the direction of George Johnson, an umpire in the Midwest Baseball League. Johnson began scouting for talent to stock the new club. Financial support was offered by the Nash and Simmons companies, long-time sponsors of local athletic teams.

Johnson soon signed Marv Wood, a 195-pound fullback from the University of California, and Walt Cassidy, a wide receiver and 1923 graduate of the University of Detroit. Others on the official roster were quarterback Jimmy Simpson, also out of the University of Detroit; running back George Seasholtz from Lafayette College; and Clete Patterson, an offensive guard from Ohio University. There were wide receiver Dick Stahlman of DePaul University; running back Dick Vick and offensive tackle Ray Oberbroekling from Loras College. One of the most popular players was Earl Potteiger, a running back. He was well known in Kenosha as a baseball player for the Simmons and Nash teams in previous years. Potteiger would go on to coach the championship New York Giants three years later. Bo Hanley was named coach of the Maroons.

===1924 season===
On October 3, 1924, the Maroons played their first game of the season against the Frankford Yellow Jackets. They lost the game 31–6. Despite the loss, hopes were high for the team&#x27;s second game, against the Milwaukee Badgers. However, the result was a 21–0 defeat.

The big game and the home opener, which became the only game the professional Maroons would ever play in Kenosha, was scheduled for Sunday October 19, 1924 against the Hammond Pros. Newspaper reports state that the weather was perfect, and remained warm during the first half of the Maroons-Pros contest which ended in scoreless tie. However, the wind shifted and a sharp breeze cooled off the thousand or so spectators at Nash Field. On the gridiron things heated up. Capping a third quarter drive, fullback Seasholtz hurtled over the goal for a Maroon touchdown. He missed the conversion kick. However, the Pros came back to score with a minute left in the game. Maroons&#x27; tackle Fritz Heinisch, a Racine native, blocked the extra point try to preserve the final tie which was considered almost a moral victory for the underdog home team.

The game drew about 600 spectators in attendance, which was considerably less than a victory since other NFL teams, like the Green Bay Packers, who could draw 5,000 hometown fans to a game.

Injuries in the Hammond game were costly. Usher broke his nose, Simpson injured his neck, and Potteiger suffered a broken arm that finished him for the season. From that point, it was all downhill for the Maroons.

On October 26, 1924, the team played a strong Duluth Kelleys team. With a powerful running attack, mixed with passes, the Kelleys wiped out the Kenoshans, 32–0. The Maroons failed to make a first down all afternoon. A game with the Waukegan Elks of the lesser Midwest League was scheduled for November 2. At the last minute, however, the Illinois team cancelled out. Some claimed that Midwest officials pressured Waukegan not to play outside its league. When manager Johnson was unable to schedule a replacement game, November 2 became an open date.

Citing the missed game and the poor local attendance at the Hammond contest, a Racine sportswriter claimed pro football in Kenosha was &quot;a flop&quot; and predicted the Maroons would not finish the season. A Maroons spokesman dismissed the accusations and announced the team would travel to Buffalo, New York the following weekend to play the Buffalo Bisons. But there was uncertainty in the air as Johnson announced that there would be a big announcement after the Buffalo game.

At Buffalo, the Maroons lost 27–0 to the Bisons. Ten Days later the &quot;high-priced&quot; Maroons players were released from their contracts and the original team disbanded. In a startling development, the local financial backers announced they were keeping the franchise and had bought the winning, but financially troubled, Duluth Kelleys. The Duluth players were to simply switch jerseys and become the new Kenosha Maroons. The Kelleys were tied for fourth place in the league with the Packers and the Chicago Cardinals.

On Thanksgiving Day 1924 a game between the new Maroons and the Racine Horlick-Legion was announced, as was another, just three days later, on November 30, 1924, with the NFL&#x27;s Kansas City Cowboys. However neither game was played. The Kelleys went back to Duluth to play several more years. For Kenosha the season ended dismally with a 0–4–1 record. The Maroons tied with the winless Minneapolis Marines and the Rochester Jeffersons for last place in the NFL.

===Aftermath===
The final chapter of the Maroons history is missing from the sports pages of the local paper. There were no announcements of the cancellation of the final two games and it went unreported that the franchise had been lost. However an error in the NFL records, which persists today, shows that the Maroons lost a fifth game that season to the Rock Island Independents. That phantom game, claimed as a victory by Rock Island, appears incorrectly in NFL records as the Kenosha team&#x27;s fifth loss of its only season. In reality, this game was held after the &quot;high-priced&quot; Maroons players and the rest of the original team disbanded, and the team that played Rock Island was instead composed of &quot;Kenosha All-Stars&quot;.

<doc id="239765" wikidata="Q833100" url="?curid=239765" title="Milwaukee Badgers">
<text>The Milwaukee Badgers were a professional American football team, based in Milwaukee, that played in the National Football League from 1922 to 1926. The team played its home games at Athletic Park, later known as Borchert Field, on Milwaukee&#x27;s north side. The team was notable for having many African-American players for the time.

After the team folded following the season (largely due to being left broke because of a $500 fine by the NFL for using four high-school players in a game against the Chicago Cardinals, a game arranged after the Badgers had disbanded for the season), many of its members played for the independent semi-pro Milwaukee Eagles. Some of the players from this team went on to play for the NFL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Pirates in 1933. This has led some to mistakenly believe that either the Badgers or Eagles became the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Milwaukee market is now claimed by the Green Bay Packers, who played three or four regular season games there from 1933 to 1994, including the 1939 NFL Championship Game. The Packers still reserve two games a season for their old Milwaukee season ticket holders, and have their flagship radio station, WRNW, there as well.

==History==

===Origins===
The Milwaukee Badgers were founded by two Chicago sporting promoters, Joe Plunkett and Ambrose McGuirk. The pair saw the city as a great prospect for a professional football club. In order to create a team that could compete immediately in the early National Football League, the men scoured the East Coast college ranks, signing multiple All-Americans in hopes of building a team of all-stars that could rival the Green Bay Packers for state supremacy. The team&#x27;s first major signing was Fritz Pollard, who had been a player-coach the previous year for the Akron Pros. Pollard was also the first black man to coach whites in American professional sports. Two other African-Americans played for the Badgers in 1922, Paul Robeson and Duke Slater.

===First years===
The Badgers played their first home game on October 15, 1922, in which they defeated the Racine Legion 20–0 in front of 6,000 fans at Athletic Park. However injuries and team disunity caught up with the Badgers, as they finished the season with just two wins, four defeats and three ties, resulting in 11th place in the standings.

The next season, the Badgers fielded an all-white team, ending their brief experiment with integration. However, the 1923 season would be the high point in the franchise&#x27;s short history, as they placed third in the league with a 7-2-3 record. However both of the Badgers&#x27; losses that season came from the Packers, who kept them a distant second in popularity among Wisconsin&#x27;s professional football fans. Even worse the Badgers struggled to even outdraw local semi-professional and factory teams. Games between those squads could draw as many as 9,000 spectators, while the Badgers rarely attracted around 4,500. In 1924, the Badgers went 5–8, before losing all six of their games in 1925 and being outscored 191–7. Meanwhile, Milwaukee citizens held so little interest in the club, that the team played just one home game.

However while interest in Badgers dwindled at home, several interested parties within the Chicago Cardinals began to take notice of them.

====1925 high school players scandal====

In 1925, the Chicago Cardinals were in need of two easy wins to help keep up with the Pottsville Maroons and stay in the hunt of the 1925 NFL Championship. As a result, the Cardinals planned two extra games that were scheduled against the Badgers and the Hammond Pros, who were both losing teams in that season. The Pros and the Badgers were both NFL teams, but had ended their seasons. The Badgers, owned by Ambrose McGuirk, agreed to a game against the Cardinals. However, McGuirk lived in Chicago, and had a tough time putting a team together to play the Cardinals. So Art Folz, a substitute quarterback for the Cardinals, convinced four players from Chicago&#x27;s Englewood High School into joining the Badgers for the game under assumed names, thereby ensuring that the Cardinals&#x27; opponent was not a pro caliber club. The high schoolers were reported to be William Thompson, Jack Daniels, Charles Richardson and Jimmy Snyder.

However NFL President Joseph Carr later learned that high school players had been used in an NFL game. He then stated that the 59-0 Cardinals win would be stricken from the record. However, the league had never got around to removing it. The game is still a part of the NFL records. Cardinals&#x27; owner Chris O&#x27;Brien was also fined $1,000 by Carr for allowing his team play the game. Meanwhile, McGuirk was ordered to sell his Milwaukee franchise within 90 days. Folz, for his role, was barred from football for life. However, by 1926, Carr toned down his punishment for each party involved in the scandal. Folz&#x27;s lifetime ban was lifted, probably to prevent him from going to the first American Football League; however he chose not to return to pro football. The $1,000 fine against O&#x27;Brien was rescinded, probably since the amount would have put the Cardinals out of business. McGuirk though had already sold his Badgers franchise to Johnny Bryan, a fullback with the Chicago Bears. The Englewood players were also forgiven, and two of them, William Thompson and Charles Richardson, earned high school all-star recognition at the end of the season. Folz reportedly told the high schoolers that the game was a &quot;practice game&quot; and would in no part affect their amateur status.

This game would also be used to state that the Pottsville Maroons should have won the 1925 NFL Championship.

===Decline===
Bryan took an aggressive approach to rebuilding the team, even ditching the club&#x27;s familiar orange sweaters for bright red. While a 2–2 start gave the team hope, but they dropped the last five games of the season and folded the following summer due to a lack of money. In ten games against the rival Packers, the Badgers were winless, managing only a scoreless tie in their first meeting.

<text>The Racine Legion was a professional American football team based in Racine, Wisconsin, of the National Football League from 1922 to 1924. Its official name was the Horlick-Racine Legion. The team then operated as the Racine Tornadoes in 1926.

==History==
In 1915, the Racine Regulars formed Wisconsin&#x27;s first important semi-professional team. They primarily played against teams from Illinois and Indiana. The team became known as the Racine Battery C in 1916 after many of the players joined the First Wisconsin Reserve Artillery Battery C.

Because of World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 the team took a break. It was reorganized in 1919 with sponsorship from the local American Legion post and William Horlick, president of his family&#x27;s malted milk company. The reorganized team was known as the Horlick-Racine Legion.

In 1922, the American Professional Football Association changed its name to the National Football League. Racine, now known simply as the Racine Legion, although its official name remained the Horlick-Racine Legion, was one of four new teams admitted to membership that season.

Led by the fullback-kicker Hank Gillo, who led the league in scoring with 52 points, Racine finished sixth in the 18-team league with a 6–4–1 record. Despite two more respectable seasons, the team failed because of finances. In 1925, the franchise was held over by the NFL, but they did not field a team that season.

Milton &quot;Mitt&quot; Romney, team captain at the University of Chicago in 1922, became a quarterback for the Racine Legion before later joining the Chicago Bears. He was a cousin of Michigan Governor George W. Romney, and his nickname inspired that of George Romney&#x27;s son, 2012 U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Facing the threat of Red Grange&#x27;s American Football League in 1926, the NFL was eager to get as many teams and players as possible into the fold to keep them away from the AFL. The Racine franchise was reactivated. The team, now called the Tornadoes, had a few of the same players as the Legion but many stars went to other teams in 1925. After winning their first game, the Tornadoes lost four in a row and disbanded in late October because of struggling finances.

==Season-by-season==
==Trivia==
The Racine Legion have the distinction of winning the only NFL game where one team scored exactly 4 points. On November 25, 1923, the Legion beat the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 10–4. Further, the Cardinals franchise had used Racine as its geographic name until 1922, referring to Racine Ave. on which the team&#x27;s home field was located.

<doc id="239769" wikidata="Q1142932" url="?curid=239769" title="Rochester Jeffersons">
<text>The Rochester Jeffersons were an American football team based in Rochester, New York from 1898 to 1925. The team was a founding member of the National Football League (NFL), in which they played from 1920 to 1925.

==History==

Formed as an amateur outfit by a rag-tag group of Rochester-area teenagers after the turn of the 20th century (a 1925 report has the team being founded in 1898), the team became known as the Jeffersons in reference to the locale of their playing field on Jefferson Avenue. Around 1908 a teenager by the name of Leo Lyons joined with the club as a player, and within two years began to manage, finance, and promote the team on a full-time basis.

For their first decade of their existence the &quot;Jeffs&quot; played other amateur and semi-pro teams from the upstate New York area such as the &quot;Rochester Scalpers&quot; and the &quot;Oxfords&quot;. From 1914 to 1917, the team grew stronger with opponents from Buffalo and Syracuse. In 1916, they were the New York State champions. By 1917, the Jeffs had started to look past state borders not only for big-name opponents, but for big-name talent as well.

At the end of October 1917, Lyons managed to secure a match against the country&#x27;s greatest team, the Canton Bulldogs, who had the legendary Jim Thorpe as their star attraction. Thorpe&#x27;s squad crushed the Jeffs 41–0, but the audacity of challenging such a superior team to a match won Lyons and his club a bit of notoriety. In 1920, Leo Lyons was at the Hupmobile showroom in Canton, Ohio to become an original member of the newly formed &quot;American Professional Football Association&quot;, which would be known in two years as the &quot;National Football League&quot;. The NFL recognizes that 1920 meeting as the founding of the National Football League.

As it turned out, Rochester was more interested in its thriving sandlot football circuit than in professional football. The Jeffersons had attempted to recruit some of the country&#x27;s best college players, but the fans would rather see local boys play, and, by 1922, the Jeffersons&#x27; on-field product was enough to annihilate local teams (thus discouraging fans from coming out as blowouts were assured) but, after some initial modest success, not good enough to compete with the rest of the NFL (thus also discouraging fans from coming out as the Jeffersons were almost assured to lose). 

As a result, the teams attendance suffered badly, with the local semi-pro teams drawing much better. Without a consistent draw at the gate, the team&#x27;s finances, play on the field and ability to draw star talent likewise suffered, and the team finished its last four seasons without a single league win. (This was not to say that the team went totally winless in this span; in a 1924 contest, the Jeffersons defeated the Pottsville Maroons of the Anthracite League; the Maroons, the class of their league, moved to the NFL in 1925, when it contended for the NFL title.) 

In 1920, John Barsha played for the team. From 1921 to 1924, two-time First Team All Pro Doc Alexander played for the team. After an unsuccessful last-ditch effort to lure Red Grange to Rochester (he instead signed with the Chicago Bears), the team suspended operations after the 1925 NFL season; by this point, the team had been losing money (to the point where Lyons&#x27; house had been foreclosed upon because of his dumping of virtually all his assets into the team) and had been a traveling team for two seasons (1924 and 1925). 

The team remained technically suspended for 1926 and 1927, but allowed its franchise to expire in 1928. Lyons stayed on with the NFL as an unofficial historian after the Jeffersons&#x27; folding.

<doc id="239771" wikidata="Q7820748" url="?curid=239771" title="Tonawanda Kardex Lumbermen">
<text>The Tonawanda Kardex (also known as the Tonawanda Lumbermen and during its first season, the All-Tonawanda Lumberjacks) was an American football team active between 1916 and 1921. It played its games in Tonawanda, New York, a suburb of Buffalo with close ties to North Tonawanda, New York where American Kardex was founded. The team is most notable for its one game as a member of the American Professional Football Association (now the National Football League) in the 1921 season. They are easily the shortest-lived team in the league&#x27;s history, and the shortest-lived known team in North American major league sports history.

==Early history==
Professional football was being played in Tonawanda by no later than 1913 (this &quot;terminus ad quem&quot; comes from records that show the team lost to the Lancaster Malleables in the region&#x27;s showcase Thanksgiving game that year). They played their home games on the Tonawanda High School field, sometimes drawing up to 3,500 fans for a game. For the team&#x27;s entire history, it was coached by Syracuse standout Walter &quot;Tam&quot; Rose. In 1917, it defeated the Rochester Jeffersons for the state championship. In 1919, it made the state playoffs but lost in the semifinals to the Buffalo Prospects, who went on to win the title.

The 1920 &quot;All Tonawanda Lumberjacks&quot; were a very successful team, garnering a record of 7–1 against two local &quot;American Professional Football Association&quot; (the predecessor to the NFL) franchises and other independent teams, only allowing more than 6 points in one of their contests (the one loss, a 35–0 decision to Buffalo). Their last game of the season against the Rochester Jeffersons was among the first games in the traditional Thanksgiving Day series.

==Tonawanda in the APFA==

With their 1920 success (and a crackdown by the APFA on playing non-league teams), the Lumberjacks joined the league in 1921 as the &quot;Tonawanda Lumbermen&quot; or &quot;Tonawanda Kardex,&quot; named for (and presumably sponsored by) James Rand Jr.&#x27;s American Kardex, a company that through mergers and acquisitions became part of Rand Kardex, Remington Rand, Sperry Rand, and eventually UniSys.

Before 1921, the team played its home games at Tonawanda High School; however, its lone game in the NFL was an away game, and according to contemporary news reports, the team had intended to play as a traveling team had it continued beyond one game. NFL records list the nonexistent and spurious &quot;Lumbermen Stadium&quot; as the team&#x27;s home field.

The 1921 season began much like the first, with a scoreless tie against the Syracuse Pros, followed by a 9–7 win against the Cleveland Panthers. A game against the Rochester Scalpers scheduled for November was canceled; instead, on November 6, 1921, the Kardex traveled to Rochester to play their sole APFA league game, against the Rochester Jeffersons. There they played the worst game of their existence, a 45–0 blowout loss to the Jeffs in front of 2,700 fans. 

Several factors played into the Lumbermen&#x27;s departure from the league. Records from the Pro Football Researchers Association indicate that Tonawanda had trouble scheduling games due to a lack of willing opponents. The now-renamed NFL&#x27;s franchise fee for 1922 also increased from $50 to $1,000, making it harder for Tonawanda to play a second season in the league. The team&#x27;s declining on-field performance was also a factor (Rochester and Syracuse were two teams that Tonawanda had beaten handily as an independent in 1920 but performed far less well against as a league member in 1921).

Whether or not the team continued to exist is somewhat unclear. Records from 1925 show that the Buffalo Football Bisons played an exhibition game against a team from Tonawanda before the 1925 regular season, but it is not known if it is the same Tonawanda team as the APFA/NYPFL franchise.

The &quot;Lumberjacks&quot; name is currently in use by North Tonawanda High School.

<text>The Rock Island Independents were a professional American football team, based in Rock Island, Illinois, from 1907 to 1926. The Independents were a founding National Football League franchise. They hosted what has been retrospectively designated the first National Football League game on September 26, 1920, at Douglas Park. The Independents were founded in 1907 by Demetrius Clements as an independent football club. Hence, the team was named the &quot;Independents.&quot;

In 1926, the Independents left the NFL to become a charter member of the first American Football League, the only NFL team to do so. The Independents then folded along with the entire league in 1927.

Pro Football Hall of Fame alumni Jimmy Conzelman (1920–1921), Joe Guyon (1924), Ed Healey (1920–1922), Duke Slater (1922–1926), and Jim Thorpe (1924–1925) played for the Independents.

==History==

===Early history===
One of the first professional football teams, the Independents were founded in Rock Island, Illinois, in 1907 by Demetrius Clements as an independent football club. The independent team had no athletic club affiliation, no social club ties and no corporate company backing or sponsorship. As a result, the team was named the &quot;Independents.&quot;

The Independents played in Douglas Park (1907–1925) and Browning Field (1926). The 1910 team went undefeated and were not scored on in five games. A year of hiatus seems to have followed.

The team reorganized in 1912, seeking to compete with the neighboring community of Moline on the gridiron. Many of the players from the 1910 team reunited in that year and, under Coach John Roche, the team won eight games without giving up a score.

Walter Flanigan was the owner of the Independents 1915 to 1923. Dale Johnson then owned the team from 1924 until it folded, along with the rest of the American Football League in 1926.

Walter Flanigan had joined the Independents as a backup end in 1912. For the following two seasons, he served as the team&#x27;s assistant manager, under then-manager Jack Roche. In 1915, Flanigan became the owner of the team and later promoted the Independents by scheduling two home games in 1917 against the Minneapolis Marines. This contest helped the Independents gain legitimacy. Rock Island lost to the Marines by a score of 7–3 in front of over 6,400 fans at Douglas Park in the first game on November 4. The two teams played again on November 18 and Rock Island lost again, 33–7, in the second game in front of 4,500 fans. However, World War I and the military draft put a temporary halt to Flanigan&#x27;s plans of expanding the team into new markets.
In 1919, Flanigan hired Rube Ursella of the Minneapolis Marines to serve as a player-coach. Ursella brought several other Minneapolis players with him. These new players would help improve play and help secure the team an invitation to join the NFL. The Independents lost only to the Hammond Pros, led by George Halas in 1919. Flanigan then challenged the Canton Bulldogs to a &quot;championship&quot; game, offering a $5,000 guarantee if they would come to Rock Island for the game.

But Canton, which had already won the &quot;Ohio League&quot; championship by defeating the Massillon Tigers, turned down the offer. It is likely that Canton&#x27;s player/coach Jim Thorpe and owner Ralph Hay felt that Flanigan could not deliver on his $5,000 guarantee. However, the Independents still had defeated the Columbus Panhandles 49–0 and the Indians 17–0 that season. In 1919, the season prior to the establishment of the National Football League, they claimed to be &quot;Champions of the USA&quot;. The invitation to Canton led to the Independents being invited to the September 17, 1920 historic meeting on the formation of the National Football League.

===National Football League===
The National Football League was formed over the course of two meetings in 1920. On August 20, 1920, an initial meeting was held by representatives of the Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Tigers, and Dayton Triangles. The meeting was held at the Jordan and Hupmobile auto showroom in Canton, Ohio and resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC).

A second and considerably larger meeting was held on September 17, 1920. The meeting was again at Canton owner Ralph Hay&#x27;s Hupmobile dealership in Canton and Independents owner Walter Flanigan was present to represent the Independents. Representatives of eleven teams were present at the second meeting: the four teams from the first meeting, plus the Decatur Staleys, Chicago Cardinals, Massillon Tigers, Hammond Pros, Muncie Flyers, Rock Island Independents and Rochester Jeffersons. The minutes of this meeting are in Pro Football Hall of Fame archives. The league was renamed to the American Professional Football Association (APFA), and the number of teams was expanded, with league play to begin in 1920.
The newly formed league elected Jim Thorpe as its first President and consisted of 14 teams. The Buffalo All-Americans, Chicago Tigers, Columbus Panhandles, and Detroit Heralds joined the league during the year. The Massillon Tigers from Massillon, Ohio was also at the September 17 meeting, but did not field a team in 1920. After the formation of the league, Flanigan was named to the committee that created the league&#x27;s constitution. Today, only two of these franchises, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), remain as NFL franchises.

On September 26, 1920, the Independents hosted the first official game featuring a team from the APFA. Thus, the Independents&#x27; Douglas Park became the site of the first ever National Football League contest. Just nine days after the league had formed, on September 26, 1920, the Independents defeated the St. Paul Ideals 48–0 in the first contest involving a member team of the APFA.

A week later, on October 3, 1920, the Independents defeated the Muncie Flyers 45–0 at Douglas Park in the first full week of APFA league play. 3,100 fans were in attendance as Arnie Wyman, former Minnesota great, made his debut for the Islanders, scoring three touchdowns. This might have been the first NFL game ever played between two NFL teams, however, NFL historical records don&#x27;t indicate the kickoff time for this game or the other APFA game played that day between the Dayton Triangles and the Columbus Panhandles in Dayton, Ohio.
The Independents posted 4–2–1 records in the league&#x27;s first year. They had the same record the next two seasons, with five of their six losses in three years coming to George Halas and the Decatur Staleys/Chicago Staleys/Chicago Bears. On June 24, 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football League (NFL).

On October 16, 1921, the Independents battled back from a 7–0 deficit against the Chicago Cardinals to lead 14–7 in the second quarter. The comeback was sparked by two touchdowns, scored by player-coach Frank Coughlin. Flanigan then ordered the team&#x27;s tackle, Ed Healey relieve Coughlin. Once Coughlin was safely on his way toward the sideline, Healey delivered a message to Jimmy Conzelman from Flanigan, it read: &quot;Coughlin was fired! The new coach was Conzelman!&quot; This act marked the first and only time an owner hired a new coach in the middle of a game. In 1922, Flanigan sold the contract of Ed Healey, to Halas and the Chicago Bears for $100. However, Healey soon became a star for the Bears and would later be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1964. In 1923, Flanigan left the Independents to concentrate on his real estate and insurance businesses.

In 1923, Flanigan sold the Independents to Dale Johnson, a local businessman. Johnson hired Vince McCarthy, the Independents&#x27; back-up quarterback as the new general manager. With Rock Island High School alumni and Olympian Sol Butler joining the squad, Rock Island went 2–3–3 in 1923, and rebounded to post winning seasons in 1924 and 1925.

Jim Thorpe, considered &quot;the World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot;, joined the Independents in 1924 and the team went 5–2–2 in league play. After the 1925 season, Thorpe formed a team composed primarily of his teammates from the Rock Island Independents, that would play several games throughout Florida. In a 1926 New Year&#x27;s Day football exhibition, Thorpe&#x27;s &quot;Tampa Cardinals&quot; played against the Chicago Bears led by Red Grange. The game itself was billed as a clash of old vs. new, with Grange, the rising star, taking on Thorpe, the aging legend. During the game Grange rushed for a 70-yard touchdown as the Bears notched a 17–3 victory at Plant Field in Tampa, Florida.

The Independents&#x27; overall NFL record was 26–14–9, with five winning seasons in six years. After finishing fourth in 1920, their best overall finish in the National Football League standings was fifth, which they accomplished three times: in 1921 and 1922 under Jimmy Conzelman, and in 1924 under Johnny Armstrong.

===American Football League===

In 1926, football star Red Grange and his agent, C. C. Pyle, formed the American Football League (AFL) after Pyle was denied ownership of an NFL franchise in New York City. In what proved to be a fatal move, after the 1925 season Johnson moved the team to the American Football League. Johnson felt that the American Football League, which featured Red Grange, would out-perform the NFL. The Independents then signed Elmer Layden, one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame for 1926. Founding American Football League teams for 1926 were the Boston Bulldogs, Brooklyn Horsemen, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Panthers, Los Angeles Wildcats, Newark Bears, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Quakers and the Rock Island Independents. Rock Island left the NFL to join the new league. The Independents also moved from Douglas Park in Rock Island to Browning Field in neighboring Moline, Illinois for the 1926 season. The Independents were the only NFL team to make the jump to the rival league.

The AFL did not pay as much as the NFL did a year prior and Independents players left the team for bigger salaries with other NFL teams. As a result, the Independents ended their season with a 2–6–1 record. Coached by Johnny Armstrong, the Independents played their first three games at Browning Field and then played the rest of their 1926 games as a traveling team. The AFL folded after the season and the Independents were rejected in their attempt to rejoin the NFL. They played as a semi-pro team in 1927, and then went out of business.

==Stadium==
From their inception until their last season, the Independents played at Douglas Park in Rock Island, Illinois, from 1907 to 1925. In 1926, in what became their final year of existence, the Independents moved to Browning Field in neighboring Moline, Illinois. Both locations are still in use today.

Douglas Park is located at the corner of 18th Avenue and 9th Street in Rock Island, Illinois. Douglas Park was also the home of the minor league baseball Rock Island Islanders during the Independents era. Today, the site has baseball field and a playground. The Quad City 76ers Semi Pro Baseball Club has called Douglas Park home since 1986. Rock Island Post 200 also plays some home games at Douglas Park. Douglas Park also hosts annual &quot;rivalry&quot; games. The Rockton Showdown features the baseball teams from Alleman and Rock Island High Schools. The Battle for the Douglas Cup features Rock Island and Moline High Schools. And, the Veterans Cup Classic features the American Legion teams from Rock Island and Moline. Douglas Park hosts an annual tribute football game to the Independents, played in retro uniforms and using early football rules.

Browning Field, the Independents&#x27; home in 1926, is located at 16th Street and 23rd Avenue in Moline, Illinois. The Independents shared the stadium with the minor league baseball Moline Plowboys. Today, Browning Field is home to Moline High School sports teams and the adjacent Wharton Field House is the former home of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Tri-Cities Blackhawks, today&#x27;s Atlanta Hawks.

<text>The  is the preserved chant of the Arval priests or &quot;Fratres Arvales&quot; of ancient Rome.

The Arval priests were devoted to the goddess Dia, and offered sacrifices to her to ensure the fertility of ploughed fields (Latin ). There were twelve Arval priests, chosen from patrician families. During the Roman Empire the Emperor was always an Arval priest. They retained the office for life, even if disgraced or exiled. Their most important festival, the Ambarvalia, occurred during the month of May, in a grove dedicated to Dia.

The is preserved in an inscription dating from 218 AD, which contains records of the meetings of the Arval Brethren. It is written in an archaic form of Old Latin, likely not fully understood any more at the time the inscription was made.

One of its interpretations goes as follows:

While passages of this text are obscure, the traditional interpretation makes the chant a prayer to seek aid of Mars and the Lares (), beseeching Mars not to let plagues or disasters overtake in the fields, asking him to be satiated, and dance, and call forth the &quot;Semones&quot;, who may represent sacred sowers. (Cf. Semo Sancus, a god of good faith.) Semones are minor tutelary deities, in particular Sancus, Priapus, Faunus, all Vertumni, all Silvani, Bona Dea. The semones are probably the hidden life forces residing in seeds: they were presented as only offering milk in the earliest tradition.

 means &quot;jump over the beam of the threshold/door/lintel, stand&quot; in standard Latin.

<doc id="239774" wikidata="Q2333721" url="?curid=239774" title="Staten Island Stapletons">
<text>The Staten Island Stapletons, also known as the Staten Island Stapes, were a professional American football team. Founded in 1915, they played in the National Football League (NFL) from 1929 to 1932. The team was based in the Stapleton section of Staten Island. They played under the shortened nickname the &quot;Stapes&quot; the final two seasons.

Jack Shapiro, a blocking back for the Stapletons, was the shortest player in NFL history, weighing between and just over tall.

==Early years==
The Staten Island Stapletons were founded in 1915 as a neighborhood team. The team was organized by Dan Blaine, who also served as the team&#x27;s halfback. Blaine later became rich by building up a chain of restaurants. The Stapletons played similar semi-pro neighborhood teams from the New York City area. During those early years the Stapes played more for fun than money. Crowds were small and player salaries averaged $10 per game (). The team won several local semi-pro titles before World War I.

The team was inactive in 1918, due to Blaine&#x27;s service commitment to the military and involvement in the war, and reactivated in 1919. By that time, he was the sole owner. He retired as a player in 1924 and continued as owner and manager of the team, commonly called the Stapes. They took the Thompson Stadium, a minor league park in the neighborhood that gave them their name, as their permanent home field. Today the stadium site is occupied by Stapleton Housing located between Broad, Hill and Warren Streets and Tompkins Avenue. Prior to moving into Thompson Stadium, the Stapletons played in two temporary local parks: Stapleton Field and East Shore Oval.

Between 1923 and 1924, Stapes manager Daniel Daley claimed the &quot;New York Metropolitan championship&quot; by beating the best independent pro teams in the area. In 1925, Tim Mara formed the New York Giants who moved into the Polo Grounds. Their presence in New York overshadowed the Stapes, particularly with the sell-out visit by Red Grange and the Chicago Bears on December 6, 1925. The Giants and Stapes began their New York rivalry on Thanksgiving Day 1925. The Giants defeated the Stapes in an exhibition game 7–0.

==Newark Bears takeover==
Over the following couple of seasons, the Stapes would play exhibitions against pro teams from the NFL and various other leagues. On November 14, 1926, the Stapes were routed by the Newark Bears, 33–0. The Bears belonged to Red Grange&#x27;s American Football League, which served as competitor to the NFL during the 1926 season. Unhappy with the defeat, Blaine promptly hired most of the Newark players, including star rookie Doug Wycoff, who were still owed money because the Newark owner was having financial problems. As a result, the Bears went out of business while the Stapletons benefited from Newark&#x27;s folding. In 1928, Blaine further upgraded the team by signing some star players from New York University, like Frank Briante. 

==Pre-NFL==
In 1927, the Stapes fielded their ex-Newark Bears squad, although Wycoff signed with the Giants. The Giants would go on to win the 1927 NFL championship and defeated the Stapes twice in non-league games, 19–0 and 18–0. The Stapes though did manage to beat the NFL&#x27;s Duluth Eskimos, featuring Ernie Nevers 7–6 on November 27, 1927. By 1928, Blaine wanted the Stapes to become an NFL franchise. He bolstered his squad by re-signing Doug Wycoff back as a player-coach and by signing six graduates from the nationally ranked New York University team. The Stapes had their best season on record, going 10–1–1, including a 3–1 record against NFL teams. They even pulled out a 7–0 victory over the Giants on Thanksgiving Day.

==NFL==
After his team rolled up a 10–1–1 record in 1928, Blaine applied for an NFL franchise in 1929. He needed permission from Tim Mara, the owner of the Giants, because Staten Island was in Mara&#x27;s exclusive territory. But Mara actually had an extra franchise. It had originally belonged to the Brooklyn Lions and had been given to Mara when the Lions folded in 1927, because they owed him money. Mara had then allowed the New York Yankees, owned by Grange&#x27;s manager C. C. Pyle, to use the franchise when that team moved from the defunct AFL into the NFL. The Yankees went out of business after the 1928 season, so the franchise again went back to Mara and he passed those franchise&#x27;s rights on to Staten Island.

Blaine promptly hired Ken Strong, who became a Stapletons Hall of Famer. Strong, who received All-American honors while at New York University, was a speedy, powerful runner who was also one of the best kickers of the era.

The Stapletons never had a winning season in the NFL. During its first NFL season in 1929, the team went 3–4–3, defeating the Dayton Triangles, Boston Bulldogs, and the Minneapolis Red Jackets. The team also managed to tie the Frankford Yellow Jackets once and Orange Tornadoes twice. The team improved to a 5–5–2 record in 1930. That season the Stapes managed to defeat the rival New York Giants 7–6, after a four-yard touchdown run from Doug Wycoff and an extra point kick from Strong.

In July 1931, the team&#x27;s official name on the league records was changed from the Stapleton Football Club, Inc., to Staten Island Stapes. At this time, Doug Wycoff left the team to rejoin the Giants. In need of a coach, Blaine hired Hinkey Haines, who had played briefly for the Stapes in 1929. The Stapes opened at home by beating the Dodgers 9–7 before 7,000 fans. A week later at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers forced three interceptions to defeat the Stapes 18–6. The team posted a 4–6–1 record in 1931, defeating the Giants, Dodgers (twice), and the Cleveland Indians.

==Decline==

In 1932, the Stapes finished last, defeating only the Giants and the Chicago Cardinals. Blaine was allowed by the NFL to suspend league play for the upcoming 1933 season. The team continued to lose money in 1933. While the team posted losses against the Giants, Dodgers, Portsmouth Spartans, and Green Bay Packers, it did manage to defeat the newly established Philadelphia Eagles. Doug Wycoff and Bob Campiglio stayed with the Stapes in 1933, but their star player Ken Strong signed with the Giants and helped them win the NFL&#x27;s Eastern Division championship that season and the NFL league championship in 1934.

Blaine went through the formality of getting NFL permission to suspend league operations for the 1934 season. The team played one more season of semi-pro football in 1934 before quietly folding a year later. In June 1935, Blaine&#x27;s franchise was finally declared forfeit. The franchise&#x27;s failure can be blamed on a combination of the Great Depression and having too small of a stadium that could never accommodate enough fans to make the team profitable.

<text>St. Louis All-Stars was a professional football team that played in the National Football League during the 1923 season. The team played at St. Louis, Missouri&#x27;s Sportsman&#x27;s Park. Ollie Kraehe owned, managed, coached, and played guard for the team.

==History==

===Origins===
The idea for the All-Stars came to Ollie Kraehe while he was still a substitute offensive lineman playing for the Rock Island Independents. Kraehe figured that if small towns markets, like Green Bay and Rock Island, could be successful operating a professional football team, then operating in a larger market like St. Louis would bring in even more income. He was a local football hero in St. Louis since he had played college football at Washington University in St. Louis, alongside Jimmy Conzelman, and had captained the 1921 team.

===Building the franchise===

====Team====
In 1923, NFL President Joe Carr gave Kraehe an NFL franchise. He paid $100 (about $1,600 in 2021) for the franchise and began organizing a team about a month before the 1923 season was to start. He also named his club the &quot;All-Stars&quot;, however, he soon discovered that there was a lack of All-American talent available. Many of the players were locals who came from St. Louis University and Washington University. Kraehe later stated that, &quot;There were some players who didn&#x27;t want their parents to know they were in the game and some of them used fictitious names&quot;. He also admitted that, &quot;there were some who pretended to be All-Americans from the East just to get a chance to play&quot;.

One of the most notorious All-American impostors for the All-Stars was a man using the alias Jack &quot;Dolly&quot; Gray. Gray claimed to be the All-American end from Princeton&#x27;s 1922 &quot;Team of Destiny;&quot; it soon became obvious that the impostor was not the Princeton end (for one, the man whose identity Gray was trying to steal was actually named Howard &quot;Howdy&quot; Gray) and was nowhere near as talented. Ollie Kraehe sold Gray to the Green Bay Packers after a game between the two. Packers chairman Curly Lambeau believed that he had just acquired Howdy Gray, who would have been by far the All-Stars&#x27; best player, but Lambeau soon discovered he had been hoodwinked after watching his new end perform so badly the next game that he addressed Kraehe on the matter. Kraehe told Lambeau that trading away the impostor was meant as a &quot;joke&quot; and that he would return the money paid for Gray to Lambeau.

However some established players like Bub Weller, an all-American from Nebraska, and Dick King, an all-American from Harvard, did play for the team. The All-Stars were big but slow, very much defense-oriented. They would give up only 15 points in their first five games, but on the other hand, they would fail to score a touchdown.

====Stadium====
Kraehe also needed a home field for his All-Stars to play. In 1923, the St. Louis Browns owned Sportsman&#x27;s Park. Kraehe was able to work out an agreement where the Browns would receive 15 percent of gross revenue, or 20 percent if the gross was more than $10,000. There were two stipulations for using the field. First, the All-Stars could practice on the outfield grass from October 10 to December 2 only if it does not interfere with the St. Louis University team&#x27;s practice. The second stipulation ended the All-Stars stadium deal if there was a World Series game played in St. Louis (something that did not materialize; for the third straight season, the 1923 World Series was played entirely in New York).

===1923 season===
The All-Stars began the 1923 season with a 25–0 defeat of a team from Murphysboro, Illinois in a non-league game. For the second game, the All-Stars played the Green Bay Packers to a scoreless tie at Bellevue Park. They followed up with another scoreless tie against the Hammond Pros.

However, the All-Stars were losing money. Kraehe lost more than $2,000, as only 719 spectators attended the team&#x27;s home opener at Sportsman&#x27;s Park. He blamed the low attendance on rainy weather and the fact that most sports fans were concentrating on the World Series being played in New York City. However, the lack of offense from the All-Stars made the St. Louis fans reluctant to spend their money to see a team that had not scored a touchdown in their first four NFL games. The All-Stars lost their second and third NFL games to the Cleveland Indians and the Milwaukee Badgers. Both scores resulted in 6–0 losses. The team also lost a fifth game to the Packers in front of a home crowd of only 750. The All-stars held the Packers scoreless for most of the game until Cub Buck kicked a 28-yard field goal to give the Packers a 3–0 win.

Things did take a turn for the better when the All-Stars played the Oorang Indians, featuring Jim Thorpe, in front of 5,000 fans the following week. The Indians were a popular attraction in the early NFL. They were more of a novelty team and not considered very good. This raised the All-Stars hopes for a victory, or at least a touchdown. Al Casey scored both of St. Louis&#x27; touchdowns in a 14–7 All-Stars win. Meanwhile, Thorpe threw a touchdown pass to put the Indians on the scoreboard. The Indians&#x27; visit helped ease the team&#x27;s financial losses.

Two weeks later, The All-Stars played the Milwaukee Badgers in a rematch at Sportsman&#x27;s Park. The Badgers&#x27; Jimmy Conzelman was one of St. Louis&#x27; most popular athletes and Kraehe hoped that his presence would put fans in the stands. 2,395 fans paid to see Conzelman and the Badgers win 17–0 (a better crowd than usual, but still below expectations).

===The end===
Kraehe estimated the financial losses for the All-Stars at $1,300 for the Badgers&#x27; game and $6,300 for the season. He was forced to cancel his final NFL game of the season against the Cleveland Indians, as injuries left the All-Stars unable to field a team.

Afterwards, he took what was left of his team to Benld, Illinois, and lost to a local team 9–7. In September 1924, Kraehe sold the All-Stars franchise back to the NFL, who cancelled it.

St. Louis would later become a stop for other NFL teams: 
* The St. Louis Gunners very briefly joined the NFL at the end of the 1934 season.
* The Cardinals, who relocated from Chicago in 1960, played in the city until 1987, when the team relocated to Arizona.
* The St. Louis Rams, who relocated from Los Angeles in 1995, played in the city until 2015, when the team relocated back to Los Angeles.

<text>The Toledo Maroons were a professional American football team based in Toledo, Ohio in the National Football League in 1922 and 1923. Prior to joining the NFL, the Maroons played in the unofficial &quot;Ohio League&quot; from 1902 until 1921.

==History==

===Origins===
The Maroons originated as a semi-pro football team known as the Toledo Athletic Association, in 1902. The Association formed the Toledo Maroons in 1906 as a farm team for teenagers who could later move up to playing for the Association&#x27;s senior team. However, in 1908, the Association was forced to disband after the owners of Armory Park, where the team played, no longer wanted the field torn up by cleats. Despite the setback, the Maroons kept playing on other fields. By 1909, the former teenagers were adults, still playing organized football, and they began to play against numerous amateur and semi-pro opponents from outside the area.

Beginning in 1915, the Maroons were playing some very strong opposition, including such future NFL teams as the Columbus Panhandles, the Dayton Gym Cadets (later known as the Dayton Triangles), and the Cincinnati Celts.

===NFL===
When the American Professional Football Association was organized in 1920, Toledo chose to remain an independent team. However, in 1922, the Maroons joined the league, now renamed the National Football League.

The Maroons finished fourth with a 5–2–2 record that season, then dropped to 3–3–2 in 1923. Attendance was poor in Toledo, so the franchise moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin, and dropped out of the league after an 0–4–1 record in 1924. The Maroons ran up a 5–2–2 record in their initial 1922 season. However, the level of competition was suspect. Their opponents&#x27; combined mark was only 7–23–2. The Maroons scheduled easy opponents again in 1923 and finished this season at 3–3–2. However, when they were blasted 28–0 in the last game of the season by the Canton Bulldogs, the Toledo squad played its last game.

After the 1923 season ended, the league ordered the team to either transfer or suspend operations. The team&#x27;s players and personnel did eventually move to Kenosha, Wisconsin to play as the Kenosha Maroons for the 1924 season. However no conclusive evidence exists that the Toledo franchise was officially transferred to Kenosha.

<text>The  is a fragment of archaic Latin, which played a part in the rituals performed by the Salii (Salian priests, a.k.a. &quot;leaping priests&quot;) of Ancient Rome. There are 35 extant fragments of the , which can be read in Morel&#x27;s &quot;FPL&quot;.

The rituals revolved around Mars and Quirinus, and were performed in March and October. These involved processions in which they donned archaic armour and weapons, performed their sacred dance, and sang the . As a body they existed before the founding of the Roman Republic, tracing their origin back to the reign of Numa Pompilius. The Salian priests were chosen from the sons of patrician families whose parents were still living. They were appointed for life, though they were allowed to resign from the Salian priesthood if they achieved a more prestigious priesthood or a major magistracy.

In the written by Roman historian Tacitus, it is revealed that several Romans proposed the name of Germanicus to be added to the Salian Song, as a memory of his virtue and goodwill.

==Fragments==
Two fragments which have been preserved by Marcus Terentius Varro in his , 7.26, 27 (fragment 2 and 1 by Maurenbrecher&#x27;s numbering):
The mysterious has attracted several proposals. Julius Pomponius Laetus proposed in his the interpretation &quot;I shall be as a kiss to grief&quot;, though his emendations are now dismissed as &quot;editorial fantasy&quot;. George Hempl restored it more carefully to , attested in some manuscripts aside from the spacing, which is good archaic Latin for classical &quot;(thou shalt) come forth with the cuckoo&quot;.

A fragment preserved by Quintus Terentius Scaurus in his (fragment 6 by Maurenbrecher&#x27;s numbering):
