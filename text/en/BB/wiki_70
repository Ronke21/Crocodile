<doc id="236403" wikidata="Q1515752" url="?curid=236403" title="Alex Neil (politician)">
<text>Alexander Neil (born 22 August 1951) is a Scottish politician who served as Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing from 2012 to 2014 and Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, Communities and Pensioners&#x27; Rights from 2014 to 2016. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Airdrie and Shotts constituency from 2011 until his retirement in 2021.

==Early life and education==
Neil was born in Ayrshire Central Hospital, Irvine, the son of Margaret (née Gunning) and Alexander Neil Sr., a coalminer. He was brought up in Patna, Ayrshire, and became involved in Labour politics, joining the Labour Party in 1967, aged 16. He was educated at Ayr Academy, before attending the University of Dundee, where he studied economics. He served as chairman of the Scottish Organisation of Labour Students and later the UK-wide National Organisation of Labour Students.

==Political career==

===Early years===
After graduating with an MA (Hons) degree in 1973, Neil was appointed as the first-ever research officer for the Scottish Executive Committee of the Labour Party. In 1976, Neil, along with Jim Sillars and John Robertson, left the Labour Party to form a breakaway group, the Scottish Labour Party (SLP). Neil served as General Secretary of the SLP from 1976 to 1979. By 1979 the SLP had collapsed and Neil fell out of active politics until 1985 when he joined the Scottish National Party (SNP).

===SNP===
Neil would go on to become the SNP&#x27;s Publicity Director, and then in charge of the party&#x27;s policy, as well as a candidate in the 1989 Glasgow Central by-election and candidate in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency in the 1992 and 1997 general elections.

===Member of the Scottish Parliament===
In 1999 he was elected SNP regional list MSP for Central Scotland in the first Scottish Parliament.

The following year he stood unsuccessfully in the hard-fought contest for the leadership of the SNP against John Swinney. Thereafter he was appointed chair of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, a role he kept on until 2003.

In 2003 he was re-elected as SNP MSP for Central Scotland to the Scottish Parliament.

In July 2004, Neil announced that he would not be a candidate in the impending contest for the leadership of the SNP, despite the fact that he believed he had considerable support within the party. He said that the reason for his decision was that senior figures in the party (such as MSP Fergus Ewing and former SNP leader Alex Salmond) had made it clear publicly that they would not work with him as leader. Neil later endorsed Salmond, who he claimed would &quot;unite the party&quot; and was &quot;best placed to maximise the SNP vote&quot;.

In 2004 Neil was appointed chair of the Enterprise and Culture Committee. He was also a co-convenor of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Cross-Party Group on the Scottish Economy.

Neil emerged as a leading supporter of former policewoman Shirley McKie as she bid to win compensation from the Scottish Government following her acquittal from perjury charges.

He was again re-elected as a regional MSP for Central Scotland in 2007. He sat on the European and External Relations Committee and the Finance Committee from 2007 to 2009, upon his promotion to Scottish Minister.

He voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the EU, a choice he made less than two weeks before the vote, and is the only SNP MSP to publicly admit doing so. &quot;I&#x27;d only recently left the SNP government and I wasn&#x27;t going to rock the boat and I quite frankly didn&#x27;t think it was all that important for me to say that at the time anyway,&quot; he told BBC Radio Scotland. &quot;The party&#x27;s position - the government&#x27;s position - was very clear and quite frankly, out of loyalty, I didn&#x27;t think it was right for me at that stage to say so.&quot;

===Government Minister===
In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government since it took office in 2007, Neil was appointed as the Minister for Housing and Communities in February 2009. In 2011 Neil defeated Karen Whitefield in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency, gaining a majority of 2001, a 5.5% swing from Labour to SNP. He was promoted to the Scottish Cabinet on 19 May 2011 by Alex Salmond to become the new Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment after the SNP&#x27;s landslide win in the 2011 Scottish election.

He was moved from that post to the post of Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in September 2012. A month into this post, in an interview with &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; Neil spoke about the possibility of abortion laws being made in Scotland rather than Westminster, saying that politicians would have to consider the medical evidence.

In May 2014 Neil survived a vote of no confidence 57-67. Opposition MSPs had alleged he had acted improperly by cancelling changes to mental health provision when he took up his post as Health Secretary. After Nicola Sturgeon became First Minister of Scotland in November 2014, Neil was appointed to the new post of Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, Communities and Pensioners&#x27; Rights. He resigned from the Government on 18 May 2016.

===Retirement===
In August 2020 he announced that he would be standing down as an MSP at the upcoming 2021 Holyrood election. In a statement, he said: &quot;After much soul searching, I have decided that to commit to another five years as an MSP would mean not having the time to pursue all the other things in life I want to do. I also owe it to my wife and family to spend more time with them. I have two beautiful granddaughters who miss me when I am away so often on parliamentary and constituency business. I want to spend more time with them.&quot;

In January 2023, Neil stated that Holyrood contained &quot;too many careerists&quot; and argued that reforms were needed to improve the quality of debate in the Chamber. He told &quot;The Scottish Sun&quot;: &quot;We have very few people in the Parliament, in any of the parties, who (are) prepared to stand up and act independently of their party leadership. I think any parliament worthy of the name has to encourage people who are dissenting voices, they&#x27;ve got to be given their view.&quot;

== Awards ==

Neil was honoured three times in the Scottish Politician of the Year awards organised by &quot;The Herald&quot; newspaper. In 2005, he was named &quot;Donald Dewar Debater of the Year&quot;; in 2017, he won the award in the &quot;Committee Member of the Year&quot; category; and in 2020, he was designated &quot;best of the best&quot; in the &quot;Donald Dewar Debater of the Year&quot; category.

== Personal life ==
Neil is married to Isabella Kerr and together they have one son.

<doc id="236408" wikidata="Q583438" url="?curid=236408" title="Robert Axelrod (political scientist)">
<text>Robert Marshall Axelrod (born May 27, 1943) is an American political scientist. He is Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at the University of Michigan where he has been since 1974. He is best known for his interdisciplinary work on the evolution of cooperation. His current research interests include complexity theory (especially agent-based modeling), international security, and cyber security. His research includes innovative approaches to explaining conflict of interest, the emergence of norms, how game theory is used to study cooperation, and cross-disciplinary studies on evolutionary processes.

==Biography==
Axelrod received his B.A. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1964. In 1969, he received his Ph.D. in political science from Yale University for a thesis entitled &quot;Conflict of interest: a theory of divergent goals with applications to politics&quot;. He taught at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1968 until 1974.

Among his honors and awards are membership in the National Academy of Sciences, a five-year MacArthur Prize Fellowship, the Newcomb Cleveland Prize of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences for an outstanding contribution to science. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1985. In 1990 Axelrod was awarded the inaugural NAS Award for Behavioral Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War from the National Academy of Sciences. He is also a faculty affiliate of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy (STPP) Program at the University of Michigan Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.

Recently Axelrod has consulted and lectured on promoting cooperation and harnessing complexity for the United Nations, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of Defense, and various organizations serving health care professionals, business leaders, and K–12 educators.

Axelrod was the President of the American Political Science Association (APSA) for the 2006–2007 term. He focused his term on the theme of interdisciplinarity.

In May 2006, Axelrod was awarded an honorary degree by Georgetown University. In 2013, he was awarded the Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science. In 2014, President Barack Obama presented Axelrod with a National Medal of Science. On May 28, 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Harvard University.

<doc id="236424" wikidata="Q823571" url="?curid=236424" title="Street performance">
<text>Street performance or busking is the act of performing in public places for gratuities. In many countries, the rewards are generally in the form of money but other gratuities such as food, drink or gifts may be given. Street performance is practiced all over the world and dates back to antiquity. People engaging in this practice are called street performers or buskers. &quot;Buskers&quot; is not a term generally used in American English.

Performances are anything that people find entertaining, including acrobatics, animal tricks, balloon twisting, caricatures, clowning, comedy, contortions, escapology, dance, singing, fire skills, flea circus, fortune-telling, juggling, magic, mime, living statue, musical performance, one man band, puppeteering, snake charming, storytelling or reciting poetry or prose, street art such as sketching and painting, street theatre, sword swallowing, ventriloquism, weightlifting and washboarding. Buskers may be solo performers or small groups.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;busking&quot; was first noted in the English language around the middle 1860s in Great Britain. The verb &quot;to busk&quot;, from the word &quot;busker&quot;, comes from the Spanish root word &quot;buscar&quot;, with the meaning &quot;to seek&quot;. The Spanish word &quot;buscar&quot; in turn evolved from the Indo-European word &quot;*bhudh-skō&quot; (&quot;to win, conquer&quot;). It was used for many street acts, and was the title of a famous Spanish book about one of them, &quot;El Buscón&quot;. Today, the word is still used in Spanish but mostly reserved for female street sex workers, or mistresses of married men.

== History ==

There have been performances in public places for gratuities in every major culture in the world, dating back to antiquity. For many musicians, street performance was the most common means of employment before the advent of recording and personal electronics. Prior to that, a person had to produce any music or entertainment, save for a few mechanical devices such as the barrel organ, the music box, and the piano roll. Organ grinders were commonly found busking in the 19th century and early 20th century.

Busking is common among some Romani people. Romantic mention of Romani music, dancers and fortune tellers are found in all forms of song poetry, prose and lore. The Roma brought the word busking to England by way of their travels along the Mediterranean coast to Spain and the Atlantic Ocean and then up north to England and the rest of Europe.

In medieval France, buskers were known by the terms troubadours and &quot;jongleurs&quot;. In northern France, they were known as &quot;trouveres&quot;. In old German, buskers were known as Minnesingers and &quot;Spielleute&quot;. In obsolete French, it evolved to &quot;busquer&quot; for &quot;seek, prowl&quot; and was generally used to describe prostitutes. In Russia, buskers are called &quot;skomorokh&quot;, and their first recorded history appears around the 11th century.

Mariachis, Mexican bands that play a style of music by the same name, frequently busk when they perform while traveling through streets and plazas, as well as in restaurants and bars.

Around the mid-19th century Japanese &quot;Chindonya&quot; started to be seen using their skills for advertising, and these street performers are still occasionally seen in Japan. Another Japanese street performance form dating from the Edo period is Nankin Tamasudare, in which the performer creates large figures using a bamboo mat.

In the 19th century, Italian street musicians (mainly from Liguria, Emilia Romagna, Basilicata) began to roam worldwide in search of fortune. Musicians from Basilicata, especially the so-called &quot;Viggianesi&quot;, would later become professional instrumentalists in symphonic orchestras, especially in the United States. The street musicians from Basilicata are sometimes cited as an influence on Hector Malot&#x27;s &quot;Sans Famille&quot;.

In the United States, medicine shows proliferated in the 19th century. They were traveling vendors selling elixirs and potions which purportedly improved people&#x27;s health. They would often employ entertainment acts as a way of drawing in potential clients and relaxing them. The people would often associate this feeling of well-being with the products sold. After these performances, they would &quot;pass the hat&quot;.

One-man bands have historically performed as buskers playing a variety of instruments simultaneously. One-man bands proliferated in urban areas in the 19th and early 20th centuries and still perform to this day. A current one-man band plays all their instruments acoustically usually combining a guitar, a harmonica, a drum and a tambourine. They may also include singing. Many still busk but some are booked to play at festivals and other events.

Folk music has always been an important part of the busking scene. Cafe, restaurant, bar and pub busking is a mainstay of this art form. The delta bluesmen were mostly itinerant musicians emanating from the Mississippi Delta region of the USA around the early 1940s and on. B.B. King is one famous example who came from these roots.

The counterculture of the hippies of the 1960s occasionally staged &quot;be-ins&quot;, which resembled some present-day buskers festivals. Bands and performers would gather at public places and perform for free, passing the hat to make money. The San Francisco Bay Area was at the epicenter of this movement – be-ins were staged at Golden Gate Park and San Jose&#x27;s Bee Stadium and other venues. Some of the bands that performed in this manner were Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Country Joe and the Fish, Moby Grape and Jimi Hendrix.

Christmas caroling can also be a form of busking, as wassailing included singing for alms, wassail or some other form of refreshment such as figgy pudding. In the Republic of Ireland, the traditional Wren Boys, and in England Morris Dancing can be considered part of the busking tradition.

In India and Pakistan&#x27;s Gujarati region, Bhavai is a form of street art where there are plays enacted in the village, the barot or the village singer also is part of the local entertainment scene.

In the 2000s, some performers have begun &quot;Cyber Busking&quot;. Artists post work or performances on the Internet for people to download or &quot;stream&quot; and if people like it they make a donation using PayPal.

== Forms ==

There are three basic forms of street performance: circle shows, walk-by acts, and stoplight performances.

&quot;Circle shows&quot; are shows that tend to gather a crowd around them. They usually have a distinct beginning and end. Usually these are done in conjunction with street theatre, puppeteering, magicians, comedians, acrobats, jugglers and sometimes musicians. Circle shows can be the most lucrative. Sometimes the crowds attracted can be very large. A good busker will control the crowd so the patrons do not obstruct foot traffic.

&quot;Walk-by acts&quot; are acts where the busker performs a musical, living statue or other act that does not have a distinct beginning or end, and the public usually watches for a brief time. A walk-by act may turn into a circle show if the act is unusual or very popular.

&quot;Stoplight performances&quot; are performances in which performers present their act and get contributions from vehicle occupants on a crosswalk while the traffic lights are red. A variety of disciplines can be used in such a format (juggling, break dancing, even magic tricks). Because of the short period of time available to them, stoplight performers must have a very brief, condensed routine. This form is seen more commonly in Latin America than elsewhere.

=== Collecting money ===
Buskers collect donations and tips from the public in a variety of containers and by different methods depending on the type of busking they are performing. For walk-by acts, their open, empty instrument case or a special can, box, or hat is often used. For circle shows the performer will typically collect money at the end of the show, although some performers will also collect during the show, as some audience members do not stay for the entire performance. 

Sometimes a performer will employ a &quot;bottler&quot;, &quot;hat man&quot;, or &quot;pitch man&quot; to collect money from the audience and encourage them to contribute, sometimes by cajoling them in a humorous fashion. The term &quot;bottler&quot; is a British term that originated from the use of the top half of a bottle to collect money. The bottle had a leather flap inserted in the bottleneck and a leather pouch attached. This design allowed coins to be put in the bottle but did not allow them to be removed easily without the coins jingling against the glass. The first use of such contrivances was recorded by the famous Punch and Judy troupe of puppeteers in early Victorian times.

The increasing use of cashless payments in the 21st century, and the corresponding lessening of the amount of cash typically carried, has affected buskers, some of whom have begun using electronic payment systems including contactless payment terminals and web or app based payment systems (sometimes reachable by QR code). This trend accelerated after COVID-19 lockdowns, but predates this.

=== Pitches ===
The place where a performance occurs is called a &quot;pitch&quot;. A good pitch can be the key to success as a busker. An act that might make money at one place and time may not work at all in another setting. Popular pitches tend to be public places with large volumes of pedestrian traffic, high visibility, low background noise and as few elements of interference as possible. Good locations may include tourist spots, popular parks, entertainment districts including many restaurants, cafés, bars and pubs and theaters, subways and bus stops, outside the entrances to large concerts and sporting events, almost any plaza or town square as well as zócalos in Latin America and piazzas in other regions. Other places include shopping malls, strip malls, and outside supermarkets, although permission is usually required from management for these.

In her book, &quot;Underground Harmonies: Music and Politics in the Subways of New York&quot;, Susie J. Tanenbaum examined how the adage &quot;Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast&quot; plays out in regards to busking. Her sociological studies showed that in areas where buskers regularly perform, crime rates tended to go down, and that those with higher education attainment tended to have a more positive view of buskers than did those of lesser educational attainment. Some cities encourage busking in particular areas, giving preference to city government-approved buskers and even publishing schedules of performances.

Many cities in the United States have particular areas known to be popular spots for buskers. Performers are found at many locations like Mallory Square in Key West, in New Orleans, in New York around Central Park, Washington Square, and the subway systems, in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C. around the transit centers, in Los Angeles around Venice Beach, the Santa Monica Third Street Promenade, and the Hollywood area, in Chicago on Maxwell Street, in the Delmar Loop district of St. Louis, and many other locations throughout the US.
Busking is still quite common in Scotland, Ireland (Grafton Street, Dublin), and England with musicians and other street performers of varying talent levels.

== Legislation ==


The first recorded instances of laws affecting buskers were in ancient Rome in 462 BC. The Law of the Twelve Tables made it a crime to sing about or make parodies of the government or its officials in public places; the penalty was death. Louis the Pious &quot;excluded &quot;histriones&quot; and &quot;scurrae&quot;, which included all entertainers without noble protection, from the privilege of justice&quot;. In 1530 Henry VIII ordered the licensing of minstrels and players, fortune-tellers, pardoners and fencers, as well as beggars who could not work. If they did not obey they could be whipped on two consecutive days.

In the United States under constitutional law and most European common law, the protection of artistic free speech extends to busking. In the U.S. and many countries, the designated places for free speech behavior are the public parks, streets, sidewalks, thoroughfares and town squares or plazas. Under certain circumstances even private property may be open to buskers, particularly if it is open to the general public and busking does not interfere with its function and management allows it or other forms of free speech behaviors or has a history of doing so.

While there is no universal code of conduct for buskers, there are common law practices that buskers must conform to. Most jurisdictions have corresponding statutory laws. In the UK busking regulation is not universal with most laws (if there are any) being governed by local councils. Some towns in the British Isles limit the licenses issued to bagpipers because of the volume and difficulty of the instrument. In Great Britain places requiring licenses for buskers may also require auditions of anyone applying for a busking license. Oxford City Council have decided to enact a public spaces protection order. Some venues that do not regulate busking may still ask performers to abide by voluntary rules. Some places require a special permit to use electronically amplified sound and may have limits on the volume of sound produced. It is common law that buskers or others should not impede pedestrian traffic flow, block or otherwise obstruct entrances or exits, or do things that endanger the public. It is common law that any disturbing or noisy behaviors may not be conducted after certain hours in the night. These curfew limitations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is common law that &quot;performing blue&quot; (i.e. using material that is sexually explicit or any vulgar or obscene remarks or gestures) is generally prohibited unless performing for an adults-only environment such as in a bar or pub.

In London, busking is prohibited in the entire area of the City of London. The London Underground provides busking permits for up to 39 pitches across 25 central London stations. Most London boroughs do not license busking, but they have optional powers, under the London Local Authorities Act 2000, if there is sufficient reason to do so. Where these powers have not been adopted, councils can rely on other legislation including the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to deal with noise nuisance from buskers and the Highways Act 1980 to deal with obstructions. Camden Council is currently looking into further options to control the problem of nuisance buskers and the playing of amplified music to the detriment of local residents and businesses.

Buskers may find themselves targeted by thieves due to the very open and public nature of their craft. Buskers may have their earnings, instruments or props stolen. One particular technique that thieves use against buskers is to pretend to make a donation while actually taking money out instead, a practice known as &quot;dipping&quot; or &quot;skimming&quot;. George Burns described his days as a youthful busker this way:

<text>Dag Hjalmar Agne Carl Hammarskjöld ( , ; 29 July 1905 – 18 September 1961) was a Swedish economist and diplomat who served as the second Secretary-General of the United Nations from April 1953 until his death in a plane crash in September 1961. As of 2025, he remains the youngest person to have held the post, having been only 47 years old when he was appointed. He was a son of Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, who served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1914 to 1917.

Hammarskjöld&#x27;s tenure was characterized by efforts to strengthen the newly-formed UN both internally and externally. He led initiatives to improve morale and organisational efficiency while seeking to make the UN more responsive to global issues. He presided over the creation of the first UN peacekeeping forces in Egypt (the UNEF) and the Congo (the ONUC) and personally intervened to defuse or resolve diplomatic crises. Hammarskjöld&#x27;s second term was cut short when he died in a plane crash while en route to cease-fire negotiations during the Congo Crisis.

Hammarskjöld was and remains well regarded internationally as a capable diplomat and administrator, and his efforts to resolve various global crises led to him being the only posthumous recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. In the Western world, his appointment and tenure were hailed as one of the most notable and successful in UN leadership. U.S. President John F. Kennedy called Hammarskjöld &quot;the greatest statesman of our century&quot;. In the third world, however, his legacy is extremely controversial, given his erratic performance in the Congo Crisis, with consequences to this day.

==Early life and education==

Dag Hammarskjöld was born in Jönköping to the noble family Hammarskjöld (also spelled &quot;Hammarskiöld&quot; or &quot;Hammarsköld&quot;). He spent most of his childhood in Uppsala. His home there, which he considered his childhood home, was Uppsala Castle. He was the fourth and youngest son of Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, Prime Minister of Sweden from 1914 to 1917.

Hammarskjöld studied first at Katedralskolan and then at Uppsala University. By 1930, he had obtained Licentiate of Philosophy and Master of Laws degrees. Before he finished his law degree he had already obtained a job as Assistant Secretary of the Unemployment Committee.

==Career==
From 1930 to 1934, Hammarskjöld was Secretary of a governmental committee on unemployment. During this time he wrote his economics thesis, (&quot;The Spread of the Business Cycle&quot;), and received a doctorate from Stockholm University. In 1936, he became a secretary in Sweden&#x27;s central bank, the Riksbank. From 1941 to 1948, he served as chairman of the Riksbank&#x27;s General Council.

Hammarskjöld quickly developed a successful career as a Swedish public servant. He was state secretary in the Ministry of Finance 1936–1945, Swedish delegate to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation 1947–1953, cabinet secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1949–1951 and minister without portfolio in Tage Erlander&#x27;s government 1951–1953.

He helped coordinate government plans to alleviate the economic problems of the post-World War II period and was a delegate to the Paris conference that established the Marshall Plan. In 1950, he became head of the Swedish delegation to UNISCAN, a forum to promote economic cooperation between the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries. Although Hammarskjöld served in a cabinet dominated by the Social Democrats, he never officially joined any political party.

In 1951, Hammarskjöld was vice chairman of the Swedish delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in Paris. He became the chairman of the Swedish delegation to the General Assembly in New York in 1952. On 20 December 1954, he was elected to take his father&#x27;s vacated seat in the Swedish Academy.

==United Nations Secretary-General==
=== Nomination and election ===
On 10 November 1952, Trygve Lie announced his resignation as Secretary-General of the United Nations. Several months of negotiations ensued between the Western powers and the Soviet Union without reaching an agreement on his successor. On 13 and 19 March 1953, the Security Council voted on four candidates. Lester B. Pearson of Canada was the only candidate to receive the required majority, but he was vetoed by the Soviet Union. At a consultation of the permanent members on 30 March 1953, French permanent representative Henri Hoppenot suggested four candidates, including Hammarskjöld, whom he had met at the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation.

The superpowers hoped to seat a Secretary-General who would focus on administrative issues and refrain from participating in political discussion. Hammarskjöld&#x27;s reputation at the time was, in the words of biographer Emery Kelèn, &quot;that of a brilliant economist, an unobtrusive technician, and an aristo-bureaucrat&quot;. As a result, there was little to no controversy in his selection; the Soviet permanent representative, Valerian Zorin, found Hammarskjöld &quot;harmless&quot;. Zorin declared that he would be voting for Hammarskjöld, surprising the Western powers. The announcement set off a flurry of diplomatic activity. British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden was strongly in favor of Hammarskjöld and asked the United States to &quot;take any appropriate action to induce the [Nationalist] Chinese to abstain&quot;. (Sweden recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China and faced a potential veto from the Republic of China.) At the U.S. State Department, the nomination &quot;came as a complete surprise to everyone here and we started scrambling around to find out who Mr. Hammarskjold was and what his qualifications were&quot;. The State Department authorized Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the US Ambassador, to vote in favor after he told them that Hammarskjöld &quot;may be as good as we can get&quot;.

On 31 March 1953, the Security Council voted 10–0–1 to recommend Hammarskjöld to the General Assembly, with an abstention from Nationalist China. The vote was conducted in secret, and Hammarskjöld was unaware his name had been put forward for the position. Shortly after midnight on 1 April 1953, Hammarskjöld was awakened by a telephone call from a journalist with the news, which he dismissed as an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke. He finally believed the news after the third phone call. The Swedish mission in New York confirmed the nomination at 03:00 and a communique from the Security Council was soon thereafter delivered to him. After consulting with the Swedish cabinet and his father, Hammarskjöld decided to accept the nomination. He sent a wire to the Security Council:

With strong feeling personal insufficiency I hesitate to accept candidature but I do not feel I could refuse to assume the task imposed on me should the [UN General] Assembly follow the recommendation of the Security Council by which I feel deeply honoured.
Later in the day, Hammarskjöld held a press conference at the Swedish Foreign Ministry. According to diplomat Sverker Åström, he displayed an intense interest and knowledge in the affairs of the UN, which he had never shown any indication of before.

The UN General Assembly voted 57–1–1 on 7 April 1953 to appoint Dag Hammarskjöld as Secretary-General of the United Nations. Hammarskjöld was sworn in as Secretary-General on 10 April 1953. He was unanimously reelected on 26 September 1957 for another term, taking effect on 10 April 1958.

=== Tenure ===
Immediately following the assumption of the Secretariat, Hammarskjöld attempted to establish a good rapport with his staff. He made a point of visiting every UN department to shake hands with as many workers as possible, eating in the cafeteria as often as possible, and relinquishing the Secretary-General&#x27;s private elevator for general use. He began his term by establishing his own secretariat of 4,000 administrators and setting up regulations that defined their responsibilities. He was also actively engaged in smaller projects relating to the UN working environment; for example, he spearheaded the building of a meditation room at the UN headquarters, where people can withdraw into themselves in silence, regardless of their faith, creed, or religion.

During his term, Hammarskjöld tried to improve relations between Israel and the Arab states, frequently playing the role of a mediator between David Ben-Gurion and Gamal Abdel Nasser. Other highlights include a 1955 visit to China to negotiate the release of 11 captured US pilots who had served in the Korean War, the 1956 establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force, and his intervention in the 1956 Suez Crisis. He is given credit by some historians for allowing participation of the Holy See within the UN that year.

In 1960, the newly independent Congo asked for UN aid in defusing the Congo Crisis. Hammarskjöld made four trips to Congo, but his efforts toward the decolonisation of Africa were considered insufficient by the Soviet Union; in September 1960, the Soviet government denounced his decision to send a UN emergency force to keep the peace. They demanded his resignation and the replacement of the office of Secretary-General by a three-man directorate with a built-in veto, the &quot;troika&quot;. The objective was, citing the memoirs of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, to &quot;equally represent interests of three groups of countries: capitalist, socialist and recently independent&quot;.

The UN sent a nearly 20,000-strong peacekeeping force to restore order in Congo-Kinshasa. Hammarskjöld&#x27;s refusal to place peacekeepers in the service of Lumumba&#x27;s constitutionally elected government provoked a strong reaction of disapproval from the Soviets. The situation would become more scandalous with the assassination of Lumumba by Tshombe&#x27;s troops. In February 1961, the UN authorized the Peacekeeping Forces to use military force to prevent civil war. The Blue Helmets&#x27; attack on Katanga caused Tshombe to flee to Zambia. Hammarskjöld&#x27;s erratic attitude in not providing support to Lumumba&#x27;s government, which had been elected by popular vote, drew severe criticism among non-aligned countries and communist and socialist countries. Hammarskjöld knew that the Belgian Government, allegedly supported by the United States, arranged for the assassination of Patrice Lumumba. In the end, his actions were supported only by the United States and Belgium.

His final report to the United Nations was some 6,000 words and is considered to be one of his most important. The report was dictated in a single afternoon to his assistant, Hannah Platz.

==Death==

On 18 September 1961, Hammarskjöld was en route to negotiate a cease-fire between United Nations Operation in the Congo forces and Katangese troops under Moise Tshombe. His Douglas DC-6 airliner SE-BDY crashed near Ndola, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Hammarskjöld perished as a result of the crash, as did all of the 15 other passengers. Hammarskjöld&#x27;s death set off a succession crisis at the United Nations, because there was no line of succession and as a result, the Security Council had to vote on a successor.

The circumstances of the crash are still unclear. A 1962 Rhodesian inquiry concluded that pilot error was to blame, while a later UN investigation could not determine the cause of the crash. There is evidence suggesting the plane was shot down. A CIA report claimed the KGB was responsible.

The day after the crash, former U.S. President Harry Truman commented that Hammarskjöld &quot;was on the point of getting something done when they killed him. Notice that I said &#x27;when they killed him&#x27;.&quot;

In 1998, documents were discovered which detailed an alleged plot, named Operation Celeste, to assassinate Hammarskjöld. The alleged plot was backed by the CIA, MI6 and a Belgian mining interest and the assassination was to be carried out by the South African Institute for Maritime Research, a South African paramilitary organisation. One of the documents stated that CIA director Allen Dulles agreed that &quot;Dag is becoming troublesome ... and should be removed&quot; and pledged local CIA support for the alleged plot. The information was contained in a file which the South African National Intelligence Agency turned over to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission in relation to the 1993 assassination of Chris Hani, leader of the South African Communist Party. The authenticity of the documents could not be substantiated because they were copies instead of originals. More documents related to the alleged plot were discovered by the South African government in 2016.

In 2011, Göran Björkdahl, a Swedish aid worker whose father worked for the UN in Zambia, wrote that in part, he believed that Hammarskjöld&#x27;s death was a murder which was committed to benefit mining companies like Union Minière, after Hammarskjöld had made the UN intervene in the Katanga crisis. Björkdahl based his assertion on interviews with witnesses of the plane crash near the border of the DRC with Zambia and on archival documents.

In 2013, accident investigator Sven Hammarberg was asked by the International Commission of Jurists to investigate Hammarskjöld&#x27;s death.

In 2014, newly declassified documents revealed that the American ambassador to the Congo sent a cable to Washington D.C. and in it, he wrote his suspicion that the plane could have been shot down by Belgian mercenary pilot Jan Van Risseghem, commander of the small Katanga Air Force. Van Risseghem died in 2007.

On 16 March 2015, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed members to an Independent Panel of Experts which was established for the purpose of examining new information which was related to Hammarskjöld&#x27;s death. The three-member panel was led by Mohamed Chande Othman, the Chief Justice of Tanzania, and it included Kerryn Macaulay (Australia&#x27;s representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization) and Henrik Larsen (a ballistics expert from the Danish National Police). The panel&#x27;s 99-page report, released 6 July 2015, assigned moderate value to nine new eyewitness accounts and transcripts of radio transmissions. Those accounts suggested that Hammarskjöld&#x27;s plane was already on fire as it was landing and they also suggested that other jet aircraft and other intelligence agents were nearby.

In 2016, the original documents from the 1998 South African investigation surfaced. Those who were familiar with the investigation cautioned that even if they were authentic, the documents could have initially been authored as part of a disinformation campaign.

In 2019, the documentary film &quot;Cold Case Hammarskjöld&quot; by Danish filmmaker Mads Brügger claimed that Jan van Risseghem had told a friend that he shot down Hammarskjöld&#x27;s aircraft. This went against the official stance maintained by van Risseghem&#x27;s family that he was not involved in the death of Hammarskjöld. According to an interview with van Risseghem&#x27;s wife, he was in Rhodesia negotiating the purchase of a plane for the Katanga Air Force, with the logbooks proving that he was not flying for Katanga at the time. The documentary crew interviewed colleagues of van Risseghem&#x27;s for the film, all of whom supported their theory. In an interview with Swedish historian Leif Hellström, van Risseghem claimed that he was not in southern Africa at the time the crash happened, and dismissed the idea of his involvement.

A document which was found in France amidst the Fonds Foccart (National Archives in Pierrefitte) in November 2021 is a death warrant for Hammarskjöld that contained the acronym OAS, the secret organization which was nestled in the French army at the time of Algeria&#x27;s war for independence. The document reads: &quot;It is high time to put an end to his harmful intrusion ... this sentence common to justice and fairness to be carried out, as soon as possible&quot;. The unsigned document is a facsimile that appeared to be a transcription of an original letter.

Hammarskjöld&#x27;s 1959 will left his personal archive to the National Library of Sweden.

== Personal life ==
In 1953, soon after his appointment as United Nations Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld was interviewed on radio by Edward R. Murrow. In the talk, Hammarskjöld declared:

But the explanation of how a man should live a life of active social service in full harmony with himself as a member of the community of spirit, I found in the writings of those great medieval mystics [Meister Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek] for whom &#x27;self-surrender&#x27; had been the way to self-realization, and who in &#x27;singleness of mind&#x27; and &#x27;inwardness&#x27; had found the strength to say yes to every demand which the needs of their neighbours made them face, and to say yes also to every fate life had in store for them when they followed the call of duty as they understood it.

Hammarskjöld&#x27;s only book, &quot;Vägmärken&quot; (&quot;Markings&quot;, or more literally &quot;Waymarks&quot;), was published in 1963. A collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends the month before his death in 1961. This diary was found in his New York house, after his death, along with an undated letter addressed to then Swedish Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, . In this letter, Hammarskjöld wrote:

These entries provide the only true &#x27;profile&#x27; that can be drawn ... If you find them worth publishing, you have my permission to do so.

The foreword is written by the English poet W. H. Auden, a friend of Hammarskjöld.

&quot;Markings&quot; was described by the late theologian Henry P. Van Dusen as &quot;the noblest self-disclosure of spiritual struggle and triumph, perhaps the greatest testament of personal faith written ... in the heat of professional life and amidst the most exacting responsibilities for world peace and order&quot;. Hammarskjöld wrote, for example:

We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours. He who wills adventure will experience it – according to the measure of his courage. He who wills sacrifice will be sacrificed – according to the measure of his purity of heart.

&quot;Markings&quot; is characterised by Hammarskjöld&#x27;s intermingling of prose and haiku poetry in a manner exemplified by the 17th-century Japanese poet Basho in his &quot;Narrow Roads to the Deep North&quot;. In his foreword to &quot;Markings&quot;, W. H. Auden quotes Hammarskjöld as stating:

In our age, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action.

Hammarskjöld&#x27;s interest in philosophical and spiritual matters is also proven by the finding of Martin Buber&#x27;s main work &quot;I and Thou&quot;, which he was translating into Swedish, in the wreckage after the plane crash.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates the life of Hammarskjöld as a renewer of society on the anniversary of his death, 18 September.

Brian Urquhart&#x27;s biography of Hammarskjöld addressed what Israel Shenker described in his &quot;The New York Times&quot; review as &quot;the oft-discussed question of Hammaskjöld&#x27;s sexuality&quot;. Urquhart reports that Trygve Lie spread rumours of Hammarskjöld&#x27;s homosexuality but, having interviewed Hammarskjöld&#x27;s close friends, Urquhart concludes that &quot;no one who knew him well or worked closely with him thought he was a homosexual&quot;. Shenker infers from Urquhart&#x27;s work &quot;that Hammarskjöld was an example, not unique in contemporary politics, of an asexual, somewhat narcissistic individual&quot; and quoted private papers where Hammarskjöld had written that &quot;the Secretary General of the UN should have an iron constitution and should not be married&quot;. Despite Urquhart concluding the rumours were inaccurate, Larry Kramer included Hammarskjöld in the &quot;I belong to a culture&quot; speech in his 1985 play &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Honors===
* Honorary degrees: Carleton University in Ottawa (then called Carleton College) awarded its first-ever honorary degree to Hammarskjöld in 1954, when it presented him with a Legum Doctor, &quot;honoris causa&quot;. The university has continued this tradition by conferring an honorary doctorate upon every subsequent Secretary-General of the United Nations. He also held honorary degrees from Oxford University, United Kingdom; in the United States from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Amherst, Johns Hopkins, the University of California, and Ohio University; in Sweden, Uppsala University; and in Canada from McGill University as well as Carleton University, in Ottawa.

* John F. Kennedy: After Hammarskjöld&#x27;s death, U.S. president John F. Kennedy regretted that he had opposed the UN policy in the Congo and said: &quot;I realise now that in comparison to him, I am a small man. He was the greatest statesman of our century.&quot;
* In 2011, &quot;The Financial Times&quot; wrote that Hammarskjöld has remained the benchmark against which later UN Secretaries-General have been judged.
* His legacy in the third world is extremely controversial, especially due to his statements to the British representative at the UN, Patrick Dean, that Lumumba was &quot;a communist puppet&quot;. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, its erratic performance in the crisis of the 1960s has had disastrous consequences for the country to this day.

==Depictions in music and popular culture==
In 1974, the Australian-British composer Malcolm Williamson, Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music, wrote his &quot;Hammarskjöld Portrait&quot; for soprano and string orchestra. The text was taken from &quot;Vägmärken&quot;, and the work&#x27;s first performance took place on 30 July 1974, at a Royal Albert Hall Proms Concert, with the soprano Elisabeth Söderström, and the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by John Pritchard.

In 1985, Hammerskjöld was one of the names mentioned in the &quot;I Belong to a Culture&quot; speech in Larry Kramer&#x27;s play &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, where the protagonist includes him in a list of 24 historical gay figures.

In the 2016 film &quot;The Siege of Jadotville&quot;, depicting the events of the Congo Crisis, Hammarskjöld&#x27;s plane (incorrectly a DC-4) is purposely shot down by a fighter jet only used by American forces at the time (it&#x27;s likely this was for production reasons, just as a DC-4 stood in for the DC-6). Hammarskjöld is played by fellow Swede, Mikael Persbrandt.

Also in 2016, the 1961 Ndola Transair Sweden DC-6 crash was featured in Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (S15, E5), &quot;Deadly Mission&quot; and &quot;Air Crash Investigation Special Report&quot; (S3, E3), &quot;VIP on Board&quot;. Peter James Howarth portrayed Hammarskjöld.

In 2023, Persbrandt again played the eponymous politician, in the film &quot;Hammarskjöld&quot;, directed by Per Fly. The film received negative reviews for glossing over its Congo Crisis controversies.

<text>Slavic (American English) or Slavonic (British English) studies, also known as Slavistics, is the academic field of area studies concerned with Slavic peoples, languages, literature, history, and culture. Originally, a Slavist or Slavicist was primarily a linguist or philologist researching Slavistics. Increasingly, historians, social scientists, and other humanists who study Slavic cultures and societies have been included in this rubric.

In the United States, Slavic studies is dominated by Russian studies. Ewa Thompson, a professor of Slavic studies at Rice University, described the situation of non-Russian Slavic studies as &quot;invisible and mute&quot;.

==History==
Slavistics emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, simultaneously with Romantic nationalism among various Slavic nations, and ideological attempts to establish a common sense of Slavic community, exemplified by the Pan-Slavist movement. Among the first scholars to use the term was Josef Dobrovský (1753–1829).

The history of Slavic studies can be divided into three periods. Until 1876 the early Slavists concentrated on documentation and printing of monuments of Slavic languages, among them the first texts written in national languages. At this time the majority of Slavic languages received their first modern dictionaries, grammars, and compendia. The second period, ending with World War I, featured the rapid development of Slavic philology and linguistics, most notably outside of Slavic countries themselves, in the circles formed around August Schleicher (1821–1868) and around August Leskien (1840–1916) at the University of Leipzig. At this time, Slavonic scholars focused on dialectology.

After World War II, centers of Slavic studies were created at various universities around the world, with much greater expansion into other humanities and social science disciplines. This development was partly due to political concerns in Western Europe and the North America arising from the Cold War. Slavic studies flourished in the years from World War II into the 1990s, though university enrollments in Slavic languages have declined since then.

== Subfields ==
Following the traditional division of Slavs into three subgroups (eastern, southern, western), Slavic studies are divided into three distinct subfields:
* East Slavic studies, encompassing the study of East Slavic peoples and their linguistic, literary, and other cultural and historical heritages.
** Belarusian studies, or Belarusistics ();
** Russian studies, or Russistics ();
** Rusyn studies, or Rusynistics (); 
** Ukrainian studies, or Ukrainistics ();
* South Slavic studies, encompassing the study of South Slavic peoples and their linguistic, literary, and other cultural and historical heritages.
** Bosniac studies, or Bosniacistics ();
** Bulgarian studies, or Bulgaristics ();
** Croatian studies, or Croatistics ();
** Macedonian studies, or Macedonistics ();
** Montenegrin studies, or Montenegristics ();
** Serbian studies, or Serbistics ();
** Slovene Studies, or Slovenistics ();
** Yugoslav studies, or Yugoslavistics ();
* West Slavic studies, encompassing the study of West Slavic peoples and their linguistic, literary, and other cultural and historical heritages.
** Czech studies, or Bohemistics ();
** Kashubian studies, or Kashubistics ();
** Polish studies, or Polonistics ();
** Slovak studies, or Slovakistics ();
** Sorbian studies, or Sorbistics ().

<text>The Hohenlohe ( ) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the north of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Neckar-Odenwald, Main-Tauber, Schwäbisch Hall and Heilbronn.

Künzelsau is the administrative centre of the district.

==Industry and companies==

The Hohenlohekreis is host to many internationally active companies in the screws and ventilation industries.

* Würth 
* Stahl

==History==
The district was created in 1973 by merging the previous districts of Öhringen and Künzelsau. It was named after the Hohenlohe family, who had once ruled most of the area until 1806, when they lost their independence as this area became part of the Kingdom of Württemberg.

==Geography==
The two main rivers of the districts are the Kocher and Jagst, both tributaries of the Neckar. The highest elevation in the district, at , is the Mühlberg, near Waldenburg.

==Partnerships==
Since 1990, the district has had a partnership with the County Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. In the same year, it also started a friendship with the district of Großenhain (now part of the district of Meissen) in Saxony, helping to build the administration according to West German standards.

==Dialect==
The dialect spoken locally is Hohenlohisch, an East Franconian dialect.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms in its upper part shows two lions, which is the symbol of the family of Hohenlohe, who once had ruled most of the area. The Wheel of Mainz in the lower half is the symbol of the clerical state of Mainz, which also had some possessions around Krautheim.

<doc id="236439" wikidata="Q6198115" url="?curid=236439" title="Jim Sillars">
<text>James Sillars (born 4 October 1937) is a Scottish politician and campaigner for Scottish independence. Sillars served as a Labour Party MP for South Ayrshire from 1970 to 1976. He founded and led the pro-Scottish Home Rule Scottish Labour Party in 1976, continuing as MP for South Ayrshire until he lost the seat in 1979.

Sillars joined the Scottish National Party in 1980 and later served as MP for Glasgow Govan after winning a by-election in 1988, and was Deputy Leader of the Scottish National Party. He was married to Margo MacDonald until her death in 2014.

==Early life and career==
Sillars was born in Ayr, the son of Matthew, a railwayman, and Agnes Sillars (&quot;née&quot; Sproat), a carpet weaver. He was educated at Newton Park School and Ayr Academy. After leaving school he worked as an apprentice plasterer, before following his father into working on the railways. Sillars served as a radio operator in the Royal Navy from 1956 to 1960, before becoming a firefighter. It was as a fireman that he became more active politically, through the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), and he joined the Labour Party in 1960. He served as a member of Ayr Town Council from 1962 to 1970, and was Head of Organisation and Social Services at the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) from 1968 to 1970.

==Political career==
===Labour Party and SLP breakaway===
Sillars was elected at a by-election in 1970 as the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for South Ayrshire, quickly establishing a reputation as an articulate, intellectual left-winger. When he first arrived in Parliament he was known for his vocal hostility to Scottish nationalism; having already co-authored a pamphlet (&quot;Don&#x27;t Butcher Scotland&#x27;s Future&quot;) that argued passionately against Scottish Home Rule, his denunciations of separatism and the Scottish National Party (SNP) soon led to him receiving the sobriquet (shared with William Ross) &#x27;Hammer of the Nats&#x27;. However, following the strong showing by the SNP at the 1971 Stirling and Falkirk by-election, Sillars began to rethink his ideals: together with the by-election victor Harry Ewing and Alex Eadie (co-author of &quot;Don&#x27;t Butcher Scotland&#x27;s Future&quot;), he eventually came out in favour of the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.

In 1976 Sillars led a breakaway Scottish Labour Party (SLP). The formation of the SLP was inspired primarily by the failure of the then Labour Government to secure a Scottish Assembly with strong executive powers. Sillars threw himself into establishing the SLP as a political force, but ultimately it collapsed following the 1979 general election. At that election the SLP had nominated a mere three candidates (including Sillars who was attempting to hold on to his South Ayrshire seat). Only Sillars came remotely close to winning and it was this failure to secure a meaningful share of the vote that prompted the decision to disband nearly two years later.

===Scottish National Party===
In the early 1980s, Sillars (along with many other former SLP members) joined the Scottish National Party (SNP). Being a left-winger he had fostered close links with the SNP internal 79 Group; who had encouraged him to join. Along with the 79 Group and the former SLP members in the SNP, Sillars started to shape the SNP as a clearly defined, left-of-centre party. Policies adopted included the support of a non-payment scheme in relation to the poll tax introduced by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, as well as the policy of independence within the European Union, of which Sillars was a leading exponent. Sillars also started talking in terms of direct action to bring prominence to the Scottish independence cause, stating that: &quot;we must be prepared to hear the sound of cell doors crashing behind us if we are prepared to win independence&quot;.

Having failed to win the Linlithgow seat from Tam Dalyell of the Labour Party at the 1987 general election, Sillars was chosen to be the SNP candidate for the Glasgow Govan by-election, held on 10 November 1988. Govan was a Labour seat (although Sillars&#x27;s wife Margo MacDonald had won it for the SNP in a by-election fifteen years previously, in 1973), but Sillars won a dramatic victory over Labour&#x27;s Bob Gillespie. A Labour press officer drafted from London for the campaign later recalled the Proclaimers &quot;driving round Govan on the back of a flatbed truck urging everyone to kick Labour where it hurt&quot;.

At the 1991 party conference, Sillars was elected the SNP&#x27;s Depute Leader, beating Alasdair Morgan by 279 votes to 184. Many had been surprised that he did not stand for the party leadership when it became available in 1990. The 1992 general election proved a disappointment for Sillars personally; as he lost his Glasgow Govan seat to Ian Davidson of the Labour Party. It was at this time that Sillars made his famous comment that &quot;Scotland has too many ninety-minute patriots whose nationalist outpourings are expressed only at major sporting events&quot;. This comment proved the beginning of a break with the SNP leadership; the leader at the time, Alex Salmond, had been a Sillars ally, but his comments in the aftermath of the 1992 general election (and it is also suspected the fact that Sillars supported Salmond&#x27;s opponent in the leadership contest, Margaret Ewing) started this break.

===Scottish Parliament===
Unlike his wife, Sillars called for abstention on the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum, He accused Salmond of having no strategy for full independence and claimed the referendum was a fraud as &quot;the SNP says it is a stepping stone to independence and Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar insists it will strengthen the Union&quot;, adding &quot;Abstention is the best form of contempt&quot;. SNP chief executive Mike Russell, however, shut down Sillars claims: &quot;Jim&#x27;s view is clearly not shared by the membership. Our National Council voted overwhelmingly by over 300 to 6 for the clear and constructive Yes, Yes strategy. The alternative that Jim seems to support is the politics of despair.&quot;

In June 2004, Sillars called for the resignation of John Swinney as SNP leader and also claimed that the party&#x27;s acceptance of devolution had been a tactical blunder. He told BBC Radio Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Live&quot; programme: &quot;Devolution has parochialised Scottish politics and marginalised Scotland at Westminster. I would challenge any of your listeners. Turn to your partner, wife, friend and say &#x27;name me 12 Westminster members of parliament&#x27; and they&#x27;ll be hard pushed to do that. Not because they&#x27;re dummies, but the Scottish media hardly gives them any coverage from a Westminster point of view, so the people in the big league, they don&#x27;t really count.&quot; In a 2019 interview with &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine, Sillars said that he felt vindicated over his decision to oppose devolution. &quot;The creation of Holyrood has narrowed the political intellectual spectrum in Scotland, and provincialised the nation,&quot; he claimed. &quot;They seem to be happy arguing about gender equality, smacking children, and who spends enough money in the health service. Where is the imagination?&quot;

On 3 March 2022, the &quot;Daily Record&quot; revealed that Sillars had donated £2,000 to Labour MSP Jackie Baillie during the 2021 Scottish Parliament election campaign. According to the Electoral Commission, Sillars made two separate donations of £1,000 in the weeks before polling day. Baillie retained her seat in Dumbarton, thus depriving the SNP of a majority at Holyrood. Explaining his decision, Sillars said he believed Baillie was &quot;a very impressive member of Parliament&quot; and that he had been impressed with her performance on the Holyrood committee scrutinising the Government&#x27;s unlawful probe into sexual misconduct allegations into Alex Salmond. &quot;She was a stand out on that committee,&quot; he said. &quot;I would prefer her in the parliament to a clone on the backbenches. I don&#x27;t think there is any doubt she is an asset to the parliament. My concern, in donating to Jackie Baillie, was to have a very able person in parliament. I didn&#x27;t want someone with considerable ability to disappear.&quot; When asked if his donation could have helped Baillie win and ultimately deprived the SNP of an outright majority, Sillars responded: &quot;If that was a consequence of it, so be it.&quot; Responding to the revelations, Tony Giugliano, the SNP candidate whom Baillie defeated at the election, said: &quot;Mr Sillars has more in common with Jackie Baillie than he does with the SNP these days - so I&#x27;m not surprised. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before he&#x27;s asked to be the frontman for the next Better Together campaign.&quot;

===European Union===
In January 2016, contrary to the SNP position, he announced he would campaign in favour of British withdrawal from the European Union during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. He said: &quot;I think [the EU] is a profoundly undemocratic organisation which has shown a callous disregard for people, in Portugal, Spain and Greece for example. They&#x27;ve been willing to make people destitute - beggar nations - in pursuit of a single policy to create a United States of Europe irrespective of whether the people want it.&quot;

The week before the EU referendum was held, Sillars criticised claims by First Minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon that leaving the EU would put Scots &quot;at the mercy of the most right-wing Tory government in modern history.&quot; He told the BBC that he was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; in Sturgeon for &quot;adopting the same tactic as Cameron and company, which is to try to drive people into the Remain side through unjustified fear&quot;. Sillars also dismissed SNP MP Joanna Cherry&#x27;s suggestion that the UK would no longer have access to trading with the EU&#x27;s free market. &quot;There&#x27;s actually no reason to believe that if the United Kingdom comes out of the European Union, there will be any problem in us trading with the EU as we&#x27;re doing at the moment,&quot; he told CNBC, citing the billions of pounds worth of goods that other EU member states sold to the UK every year.

===Scottish independence referendum===
In 2014 his book &quot;In Place of Fear II: A Socialist Programme for an Independent Scotland&quot; was published, in which he outlined his vision of a socialist and independent Scotland. The book was named after Aneurin Bevan&#x27;s 1952 work, &quot;In Place of Fear&quot;. During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Sillars said: &quot;BP, in an independent Scotland, will need to learn the meaning of nationalisation, in part or in whole, as it has in other countries who have not been as soft as we have forced to be. We will be the masters of the oil fields, not BP or any other of the majors.&quot;

In March 2022, Sillars claimed that it was &quot;foolish&quot; to talk about another independence referendum whilst the Russo-Ukrainian War was going on. In an open letter, he wrote: &quot;The prime objective of the independence movement is not to hold a referendum now, but to create an overwhelming majority for independence. Only when that is achieved do we want a referendum, because that will be one we can win. That is not the case today.&quot; An SNP spokesperson responded: &quot;Jim Sillars recently called for independence to be &#x27;deprioritised&#x27; – and donated cash to keep Scotland under Westminster control. Any claims he has to support independence are contradicted by his own words and deeds.&quot;

Sillars told an Alba Party meeting in July 2023 that Scottish independence supporters were &quot;in no position to win&quot; in proposed second referendum. He also backed the creation of a single pro-independence organisation, which was unaffiliated to any party, to campaign for Scottish independence.

===Alba Party===
On 26 March 2021, Sillars backed Alex Salmond&#x27;s new Alba Party, saying: &quot;This is a very welcome development as it gives the independence voters a party that is not the SNP – which many, including me, with justification, believe is tainted with political corruption, and which is grossly incompetent in a whole range of its activities from building ferries to building hospitals, and boasting about being the Saudi Arabia of wind, without creating jobs.&quot; He still remains a member of the SNP, but told &quot;Holyrood&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Politically Speaking&quot; podcast that he had not voted for them &quot;for a long time&quot;. He said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t join Alba, and I won&#x27;t join Alba. Alba and the SNP means the movement is split, and a split movement will not win. I&#x27;m hoping a change of leadership in the SNP is going to happen and I&#x27;m staying in the SNP, hoping to influence people, saying &#x27;look, we&#x27;ve got to have a rapprochement with the people who left to join Alba.&#x27;&quot;

Following the defeat of the SNP in the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Sillars described John Swinney&#x27;s leadership as &quot;a busted flush&quot; and Nicola Sturgeon as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s wee sister&quot;.

<doc id="236444" wikidata="Q2419636" url="?curid=236444" title="Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>Faith Lehane is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Played by actress Eliza Dushku, Faith was introduced in the third season of &quot;Buffy&quot; and was a focus of that season&#x27;s overarching plot. She returned for shorter story arcs on &quot;Buffy&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;Angel&quot;. The character&#x27;s story is continued in the comic book series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;, and she also appears in apocryphal material such as other comic books and novels. Faith was set to receive her own spin-off television series after the final season of &quot;Buffy&quot;, but Eliza Dushku declined the offer, and the series was never made. The character later co-stars in the 25-issue comic book &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; beginning in August 2011 under the banner of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot;, the story taking place mostly in London and the surrounding area. Seven years after the character&#x27;s creation, Whedon granted her the surname Lehane for a role-playing game and subsequent material. The last issue of &quot;Season Eight&quot; was the first source officially confirmed to be canon that referred to Faith by her full name.

Faith is a Slayer: a girl endowed with supernatural abilities and destined to battle evil creatures such as vampires and demons. Created as a foil to the protagonist, Buffy Summers, she is a Slayer who comes from a damaged background and often makes the wrong decision. Initially an ally to the main characters, events take a toll on Faith&#x27;s sanity and she slips into a villainous role. Later storylines show her feeling remorse for her past crimes, and with the benevolent vampire Angel&#x27;s help she eventually rejoins the side of good in the hopes of achieving redemption.

==Appearances==

===Television===

In &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; season 3, Faith arrives in Sunnydale, having been activated as the Slayer by the death of Kendra (Bianca Lawson) (who was activated by Buffy&#x27;s temporary death in the first season) in the episode &quot;Becoming, Part One&quot;. Coming from a traumatic and abusive background, Faith tries to fit in with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her friends, but becomes increasingly isolated and bitter as the season progresses. A major turning point for the character occurs in the mid-season episode &quot;Bad Girls&quot;; while trying to show Buffy the fun side of slaying, Faith accidentally kills Deputy Mayor Allan Finch (Jack Plotnick), a human being whom she mistakes for a vampire. Feeling more alienated than ever, she betrays the Scooby Gang and allies herself with the villainous Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener), eventually forming a sincere father-daughter relationship with him. After Faith tries to murder Buffy&#x27;s vampire lover Angel (David Boreanaz) under the mayor&#x27;s orders, the two Slayers finally battle it out in the season finale, a confrontation which leaves Faith alive but comatose.

Faith returns to &quot;Buffy&quot; for two episodes in the fourth season. Waking up from her coma, she seeks revenge on Buffy by switching their bodies using a mystical device called the Draconian Katra left to her by the now-deceased Mayor. As Buffy is taken into custody by the Watchers&#x27; Council for crimes she did not commit, Faith discovers for the first time what it is like to be surrounded by loving friends and family, and Buffy starts to understand Faith despite being upset with her predicament. After feeling obliged to rescue a church full of people from vampires, Faith battles Buffy once again, expressing extreme self-hatred before being returned to her own body. The storyline is continued in the first season of spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot;, as Faith escapes to Los Angeles and is hired by Wolfram &amp; Hart to assassinate Angel. Instead, she plots an intricate plan to have Angel kill her, but Angel convinces her to face the consequences of her actions, bonds with her as a friend and ally due to their similarities, and helps her on the path to redemption. Faith hands herself over to the police and she is sentenced to prison, where Angel later visits her.

In &quot;Angel&quot; season 4, Angel is reverted to the evil Angelus after having his soul removed. Faith is approached by her former Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof), who informs her of Angelus&#x27;s presence, sparking her to break out of prison and help them. Wanting to help Angel the way he helped her, Faith injects herself with a mystical drug and feeds herself to Angelus in order to incapacitate him so that their allies can work to restore his soul. She nearly dies from the drug, but during a psychic mind walk, Angel persuades her subconscious not to give up and that life is worth living.
Afterwards, a recovered Faith travels back to Sunnydale, where she plays a significant role in the battle against the First Evil in the final season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. In these episodes, she reconciles with Buffy, although their relationship is tested when the Potential Slayers appoint Faith as their leader over Buffy. This decision later proves disastrous when Faith&#x27;s plan leads them into a trap, leaving several girls dead. She and the survivors are saved by Buffy, and the two finally make peace with one another. After a one-night stand with school principal Robin Wood (D.B. Woodside), the two begin a romantic relationship when they both survive the battle in the series finale. Faith was set to receive her own spin-off following the end of &quot;Buffy&quot;, which, according to Tim Minear, would have featured Faith &quot;probably on a motorcycle, crossing the Earth, trying to find her place in the world.&quot; However, Eliza Dushku chose to take other offers for her post-&quot;Buffy&quot; career.

===Literature===
Faith made appearances in various &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; comic books and novels. In the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; comic book story &quot;Haunted&quot;, an imprisoned Faith reveals to Angel her memories of being in a coma between &quot;Buffy&quot; seasons three and four; she shared a psychic link with the Mayor&#x27;s spirit and could see him attacking people through his eyes. &quot;Note from the Underground&quot; sees Faith being temporarily released from jail into Angel&#x27;s custody, in order to help Buffy defeat the demonic fascists, the Scourge. &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Faith Trials, Vol. 1&quot; is a novelization of &quot;Buffy&quot; season 3 episodes which center around Faith, including &quot;Faith, Hope &amp; Trick&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, and &quot;Consequences&quot;. These episodes focus specifically on Faith&#x27;s arrival in Sunnydale, and her subsequent turn to the dark side following the death of the Deputy Mayor. Faith appeared prominently in her own 2006 novel &quot;Go Ask Malice: A Slayer&#x27;s Diary&quot; by Robert Joseph Levy, which elaborates on Faith&#x27;s back-story in South Boston and how she came to be the Slayer. Written in diary format, it fleshes out many areas of Faith&#x27;s past which were only alluded to in the show, such as her alcoholic mother&#x27;s abuse, her previous relationships, and her first Watcher&#x27;s gruesome death at the hands of the vampire Kakistos. Author Robert Joseph Levy describes writing the book, &quot;I wanted to explore the choices she made and the choices that were taken away from her, and how they affected her mental state and her development from Potential to Chosen before she arrived.&quot; Expanded Universe material such as this is not usually considered canonical unless otherwise stated.

Faith is featured in the ongoing comic book, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (2007–11), which serves as a canonical continuation of the television series. In the storyline &quot;No Future For You&quot;, Faith goes undercover on a mission from Giles to assassinate rogue Slayer Genevieve &quot;Gigi&quot; Savidge, who plans to usurp Buffy&#x27;s position as leader to the Slayers. Instead, Faith forms an unexpected connection with Gigi and finds herself torn between her new friend and her old enemy. When Gigi discovers her true identity, Faith unintentionally kills her in battle, and the arc ends with Faith finding a new purpose alongside Giles, helping slayers so they won&#x27;t go down the path she and Gigi did. Faith and Giles later reappear over a year later in &quot;Safe&quot;, which recounts one of their missions in Germany. Faith reconvenes with Buffy to face the threats of the villain Twilight in &quot;Retreat&quot;, and is captured alongside Giles and Andrew by Twilight. As such, she is witness to the reveal that Twilight is in fact Angel in &quot;Twilight, Part II&quot;. In the final story arc, &quot;Last Gleaming&quot;, Faith battles in the ruins of Sunnydale alongside other Scooby Gang members and Slayers. Underground however, Angel—possessed by the Twilight entity—snaps Giles&#x27; neck in order to prevent the destruction of its power source; a grief-stricken Buffy destroys it however, Angel is freed from Twilight&#x27;s possession, and magic is mostly cut off from the universe. In the final issue, set some time later, per Giles&#x27; will, all of his worldly assets, save a book, have been left to Faith. In Faith&#x27;s care is a distraught Angel, whom she intends to rehabilitate.

Following &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Faith received her own title in &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; (2011–2013), a companion series to &quot;Season Nine&quot;. The story depicts Angel and Faith, as residents in Giles&#x27; London home, attending to his unfinished business and fighting the forces of evil in London while Angel covertly pursues a plan to resurrect Giles. Faith takes on the role of mentor to a group of Slayers, but those relationships are strained by her friendship with Angel. Ultimately, the group are successful in resurrecting Giles (albeit as a young boy), as well as averting the apocalypse. The story ends with Faith deciding to take some time alone to find herself. She is next seen in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot; (2014–2016), when she brings Giles to reconnect with Buffy, and is hurt when Giles coldly tells her that his first priority is Buffy. In the accompanying second volume of &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;, Faith initially finds a home for herself in Kennedy&#x27;s Slayer private security firm, and while working with them, is troubled by her mission to rescue Riley Finn, whom she slept with while posing as Buffy some years ago. Ultimately, she returns to London to fight alongside Angel against the ancient demon Archaeus, who had been terrorising London.

==Concept and creation==
The initial concept for Faith&#x27;s character was &quot;the road not taken&quot;, a Slayer who makes the wrong choices in life. She is intended to be a reflection of Buffy, and what Buffy could have become were it not for her support system of friends and family. The question the writers wanted to answer was, despite being made from the same &quot;raw materials,&quot; how would upbringing and environment affect the type of people they would become later in life? Joss Whedon describes her as everything Buffy would never let herself become; although Buffy is tempted by Faith&#x27;s approach to slaying, she ultimately decides not to make the same choices herself. Some fans argued that the show developed a lesbian subtext between Faith and Buffy; Jane Espenson states that Whedon says he didn&#x27;t intend this, but admitted it was there after he had it pointed out to him, jokingly attributing this to his subconscious.

With Faith, the writers explored the nature of power, and the boundaries and consequences of its use. They wanted to address the issue that, whether the creatures a Slayer kills are good or evil, she is still a professional killer. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, and writer of Faith-centric episodes such as &quot;Revelations&quot; and &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, says one of the things he loves about the character is that Faith is not wrong in describing herself and Buffy as killers. He goes on to discuss a Slayer&#x27;s rights and responsibilities, and how Faith believes her contributions to society relieve her of any legal or moral responsibilities, a view which Buffy does not share. When writing Faith, Petrie looked to Frank Miller&#x27;s violent Marvel Comics character Elektra Natchios for inspiration, claiming, &quot;In a different, teen, punkier context, Faith is so much like Elektra.&quot;

Known only as &quot;Faith&quot; during the television series; she was not given a surname until 2005, seven years after her first appearance. Joss Whedon was approached by Eden Studios to create surnames for Faith and Kendra to use in a &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; role-playing game, and chose &quot;Lehane&quot; for Faith, because he wanted something &quot;southie&quot;.

==Characterization==
Actress Eliza Dushku describes Faith as the &quot;working class&quot; Slayer, a reason she feels so many people identify with her. She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming &quot;I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She&#x27;s totally tragic.&quot; According to Petrie, &quot;The whole key to Faith is that she&#x27;s in pain. If you took that away, she would be a monster. But she&#x27;s so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That&#x27;s what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they&#x27;re really a monster.&quot; Petrie claims Faith&#x27;s main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. &quot;So, she&#x27;s always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane&quot; says Petrie. &quot;Plus, I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. &#x27;If you don&#x27;t love me, you will fear me,&#x27; is kind of her m.o. She&#x27;s not a stable girl, but a fun one.&quot; Petrie describes the character&#x27;s name as &quot;wildly ironic&quot;, due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, &quot;She&#x27;s the most faithless character we&#x27;ve got. She doesn&#x27;t trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It&#x27;s much more fun if you look at it from their point of view.&quot;

Writer Jane Espenson believes one of the reasons why Faith elicits sympathy from the audience is the father/daughter relationship between her and the mayor, comparing their affection for one another to that between vampires Spike and Drusilla in the earlier season. The writers wanted to make both Faith and the Mayor as human as possible by showing they need connection and love as much as the heroic characters. Eliza Dushku asserts that Faith&#x27;s bond with the mayor stems from him being one of the few people in her life who does not put her down, which is something she has battled with her whole life; Dushku goes on to say Faith&#x27;s misplaced trust in the Mayor &quot;leads her into being crazier&quot;.

In the &quot;Angel&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, Faith forms a bond with the vampire-with-a-soul Angel; executive producer David Greenwalt explains Angel can help her because he alone is able to understand the suffering she has been through and how to help her atone for her sins. Faith is then able to return the favor in &quot;Angel&quot;&#x27;s fourth season, when she is the only one determined to defeat Angel&#x27;s soulless alter ego Angelus without killing him in the process. Actor David Boreanaz explains, &quot;I think having a character like Faith come back at a pivotal point when she finds out Angelus is loose is really, for her character, a way of saying: &#x27;I&#x27;m paying you back, Angel, for saving me, therefore, I&#x27;m gonna save you.&#x27;&quot; The writers believed it would be an interesting dynamic to have former &quot;bad girl&quot; Faith play a heroic role against the show&#x27;s now villainous protagonist, Angel.
Faith was brought back for the final season of &quot;Buffy&quot;, because, according to David Solomon, &quot;she had been such a crucial character at a very specific junction in the series that there would be no way to tie it up without her.&quot; However, in season 7 the dynamic between the two Slayers has changed. As Rebecca Rand Kirshner explains, &quot;[Faith] is no longer such a complete opposite of Buffy. And there&#x27;s sort of a subtler and more complicated dynamic between them&quot;. As Buffy struggles with her unwanted position of mentor to the Potential Slayers, the writers used Faith to create an outside conflict about Buffy&#x27;s leadership abilities. Although Faith is questioning Buffy and her choices she is making, she is no longer an enemy to her either. In the episode &quot;Empty Places&quot;, the Potentials lose trust in Buffy and appoint Faith as their leader instead, a decision that literally blows up in their faces. As Drew Goddard explains, &quot;Faith is like the cool aunt that everyone loves, because the cool aunt doesn&#x27;t have the responsibility of raising the children. She just gets to show up and have fun. The problem is, Faith is not ready to lead. She&#x27;s damaged in her own way. She&#x27;s just beginning to pull herself together. As much as she wants to be Buffy, she has to learn how to become Faith.&quot;

When writing &quot;Go Ask Malice&quot;, author Robert Joseph Levy encountered a number of issues to negotiate in writing a back-story for Faith. One of these was retaining the mystery of the character; Levy explains many aspects of Faith&#x27;s background, such as her delinquency and promiscuity, are supposed to be assumed by the viewers of the show, and he didn&#x27;t want to spell everything out by writing a &quot;case study&quot; of her. In order to do something non-traditional, Levy chose to tell the story in a diary format, watching many episodes of the television series to get a hold on the natural cadence of her voice. He reveals he looked to Faith herself in order to overcome his fear of writing such a popular character, &quot;She&#x27;s not hesitant and in a lot of ways, I took a lot of inspiration from the character itself in terms of creative process — to really go for it and be strong in my choices&quot;.

<text>In chemistry, a nucleophilic substitution (SN) is a class of chemical reactions in which an electron-rich chemical species (known as a nucleophile) replaces a functional group within another electron-deficient molecule (known as the electrophile). The molecule that contains the electrophile and the leaving functional group is called the substrate. 

The most general form of the reaction may be given as the following: 

:formula_1

The electron pair (:) from the nucleophile (Nuc) the substrate () and bonds with it. Simultaneously, the leaving group (LG) departs with an electron pair. The principal product in this case is . The nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged.

An example of nucleophilic substitution is the hydrolysis of an alkyl bromide, R-Br under basic conditions, where the attacking nucleophile is hydroxyl () and the leaving group is bromide ().

:&lt;chem&gt;OH- + R-Br -&gt; R-OH + Br-&lt;/chem&gt;

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are common in organic chemistry. Nucleophiles often attack a saturated aliphatic carbon. Less often, they may attack an aromatic or unsaturated carbon.

== Saturated carbon centres ==

=== SN1 and SN2 reactions ===
In 1935, Edward D. Hughes and Sir Christopher Ingold studied nucleophilic substitution reactions of alkyl halides and related compounds. They proposed that there were two main mechanisms at work, both of them competing with each other. The two main mechanisms were the SN1 reaction and the SN2 reaction, where &quot;S&quot; stands for substitution, &quot;N&quot; stands for nucleophilic, and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction.

In the SN2 reaction, the addition of the nucleophile and the elimination of leaving group take place simultaneously (i.e. a concerted reaction). SN2 occurs when the central carbon atom is easily accessible to the nucleophile.

In SN2 reactions, there are a few conditions that affect the rate of the reaction. First of all, the 2 in SN2 implies that there are two concentrations of substances that affect the rate of reaction: substrate (Sub) and nucleophile. The rate equation for this reaction would be Rate=k[Sub][Nuc]. For a SN2 reaction, an aprotic solvent is best, such as acetone, DMF, or DMSO. Aprotic solvents do not add protons (H+ ions) into solution; if protons were present in SN2 reactions, they would react with the nucleophile and severely limit the reaction rate. Since this reaction occurs in one step, steric effects drive the reaction speed. In the intermediate step, the nucleophile is 185 degrees from the leaving group and the stereochemistry is inverted as the nucleophile bonds to make the product. Also, because the intermediate is partially bonded to the nucleophile and leaving group, there is no time for the substrate to rearrange itself: the nucleophile will bond to the same carbon that the leaving group was attached to. A final factor that affects reaction rate is nucleophilicity; the nucleophile must attack an atom other than a hydrogen.

By contrast the SN1 reaction involves two steps. SN1 reactions tend to be important when the central carbon atom of the substrate is surrounded by bulky groups, both because such groups interfere sterically with the SN2 reaction (discussed above) and because a highly substituted carbon forms a stable carbocation.

Like SN2 reactions, there are quite a few factors that affect the reaction rate of SN1 reactions. Instead of having two concentrations that affect the reaction rate, there is only one, substrate. The rate equation for this would be Rate=k[Sub]. Since the rate of a reaction is only determined by its slowest step, the rate at which the leaving group &quot;leaves&quot; determines the speed of the reaction. This means that the better the leaving group, the faster the reaction rate. A general rule for what makes a good leaving group is the weaker the conjugate base, the better the leaving group. In this case, halogens are going to be the best leaving groups, while compounds such as amines, hydrogen, and alkanes are going to be quite poor leaving groups. As SN2 reactions were affected by sterics, SN1 reactions are determined by bulky groups attached to the carbocation. Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.

== Reactions ==

There are many reactions in organic chemistry involving this type of mechanism. Common examples include:

* Organic reductions with hydrides, for example
:: using   (S2)
* Hydrolysis reactions such as
:: (S2) or
::   (S1)
* Williamson ether synthesis
::   (S2)
* The Wenker synthesis, a ring-closing reaction of aminoalcohols.
* The Finkelstein reaction, a halide exchange reaction. Phosphorus nucleophiles appear in the Perkow reaction and the Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction.
* The Kolbe nitrile synthesis, the reaction of alkyl halides with cyanides.

=== Borderline mechanism ===

An example of a substitution reaction taking place by a so-called borderline mechanism as originally studied by Hughes and Ingold is the reaction of &quot;1-phenylethyl chloride&quot; with sodium methoxide in methanol.
The reaction rate is found to the sum of S1 and S2 components with 61% (3,5 M, 70 °C) taking place by the latter.

=== Other mechanisms ===

Besides S1 and S2, other mechanisms are known, although they are less common. The Si mechanism is observed in reactions of thionyl chloride with alcohols, and it is similar to S1 except that the nucleophile is delivered from the same side as the leaving group.

Nucleophilic substitutions can be accompanied by an allylic rearrangement as seen in reactions such as the Ferrier rearrangement. This type of mechanism is called an S1&#x27; or S2&#x27; reaction (depending on the kinetics). With allylic halides or sulphonates, for example, the nucleophile may attack at the γ unsaturated carbon in place of the carbon bearing the leaving group. This may be seen in the reaction of 1-chloro-2-butene with sodium hydroxide to give a mixture of 2-buten-1-ol and 1-buten-3-ol:

:&lt;chem&gt;CH3CH=CH-CH2-Cl -&gt; CH3CH=CH-CH2-OH + CH3CH(OH)-CH=CH2&lt;/chem&gt;

The Sn1CB mechanism appears in inorganic chemistry. Competing mechanisms exist.

In organometallic chemistry the nucleophilic abstraction reaction occurs with a nucleophilic substitution mechanism.

== Unsaturated carbon centres ==
Nucleophilic substitution via the SN1 or SN2 mechanism does not generally occur with vinyl or aryl halides or related compounds. Under certain conditions nucleophilic substitutions may occur, via other mechanisms such as those described in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution article.

Substitution can occur at the carbonyl group, such as acyl chlorides and esters.

<text>The Financial Services Authority (FSA) was a quasi-judicial body accountable for the regulation of the financial services industry in the United Kingdom between 2001 and 2013. It was founded as the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) in 1985. Its board was appointed by the Treasury, although it operated independently of government. It was structured as a company limited by guarantee and was funded entirely by fees charged to the financial services industry.

Due to perceived regulatory failure of the banks during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the UK government decided to restructure financial regulation and abolish the FSA. On 19 December 2012, the Financial Services Act 2012 received royal assent, abolishing the FSA with effect from 1 April 2013. Its responsibilities were then split between two new agencies: the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England.

Until its abolition, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell was the FSA&#x27;s chairman and Hector Sants was CEO until the end of June 2012, having announced his resignation on 16 March 2012.

Its main office was in Canary Wharf, London, with another office in Edinburgh. When acting as the competent authority for listing of shares on a stock exchange and maintaining the Official List, it was referred to as the UK Listing Authority (UKLA).

== History ==
===SIB===

The Securities and Investments Board Ltd (&quot;SIB&quot;) was incorporated on 7 June 1985 at the instigation of the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was the sole member of the company and who delegated certain statutory regulatory powers to it under the then Financial Services Act 1986. It had the legal form of a company limited by guarantee (number 01920623). After a series of scandals in the 1990s, culminating in the collapse of Barings Bank, there was a desire to bring to an end the self-regulation of the financial services industry and to consolidate regulatory responsibilities which had been split amongst multiple regulators.

===FSA===
The name of the Securities and Investments Board was changed to the Financial Services Authority on 28 October 1997 and it started to exercise statutory powers given to it by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 that replaced the earlier legislation and came into force on 1 December 2001. At that time the FSA also took over the role of the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) which had been a self-regulatory organisation responsible for supervising the trading in shares and futures in the UK.

===Abolition===
On 16 June 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced plans to abolish the FSA and separate its responsibilities between a number of new agencies and the Bank of England. The Financial Conduct Authority would be responsible for policing the financial activities of the City and the banking system. A new Prudential Regulation Authority would carry out the prudential regulation of financial firms, including banks, investment banks, building societies and insurance companies.

On 19 December 2012 the Financial Services Act 2012 received royal assent and came into force on 1 April 2013. The act created a new regulatory framework for financial services and abolished the FSA. Specifically, the Act gave the Bank of England responsibility for financial stability, bringing together macro and micro prudential regulation, and created a new regulatory structure consisting of the Bank of England&#x27;s Financial Policy Committee, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority.

==Activities==

=== Scope ===
From 14 January 2005 the FSA also regulated the motor industry, applicable when insurance products were sold in conjunction with the vehicle purchase. This regulation, which covered around 5,000 motor dealers, focused heavily on the FSA&#x27;s &quot;Treating Customers Fairly&quot;.

=== Statutory objectives ===

The Financial Services Act 2010, which was passed by Parliament on 8 April 2010, gave the FSA the additional statutory objective of &quot;Contributing to the protection and enhancement of the stability of the UK financial system&quot; and removed the public awareness objective.

===Retail consumers===
The FSA had a priority of making retail markets for financial products and services work more effectively, and so help retail consumers to get a fair deal. Over several years, the FSA developed work to raise levels of confidence and capability among consumers. From 2004, this work was described as a national strategy on building financial capability in the UK.

In June 2006, the FSA created its Retail Distribution Review (RDR) programme which they maintained would enhance consumer confidence in the retail investment market. The RDR came into force on 31 December 2012.

The RDR was expected to have a significant impact on the way in which financial services are delivered to retail investors in the UK. The primary delivery mechanism of financial services to retail customers was via approximately 30,000 financial intermediaries (FIs) who were authorised and regulated by the FSA. They were expected to bear the brunt of the force of the RDR. The key elements of RDR were:

# Independent advice is truly independent and reflects investors&#x27; needs.
# People can clearly identify and understand the service they are being offered.
# Commission-bias is removed from the system and recommendations made by advisers are not influenced by product providers.
# Investors know up-front how much advice is going to cost and how they will pay for it.
# All investment advisers will be qualified to a new, higher level, regarded as equivalent to the first year of a degree

The combination of these factors was expected to significantly reduce the profitability of many FI practices. In anticipation of the new regulatory environment being enforced the industry landscape is undergoing significant change. Despite the fact that many in the industry are considered to be poorly prepared for the changes coming into effect, The most significant identifiable trends are:

# Consolidators buying up small firms of FIs as a result of the higher qualifications threshold and downward pressures on profitability resulting from RDR – E&amp;Y estimate that the number of Registered Individuals will fall from 30,000 to 20,000 within the next 5 years.
# IFAs are embracing the concept of wrap account – incumbent fund supermarkets and Life Assurance Companies are in response launching their own Wrap Platforms.
# IFAs are rapidly moving from the traditional investment solution for clients: recommending a portfolio of largely equity-oriented collective investment schemes (Unit trusts and OEICs) and being paid initial and annual renewal commission by the fund provider to an outsourcing model: recommending that clients appoint a discretionary fund manager to manage the client&#x27;s portfolio(s) and charging the client an annual oversight fee. A recent survey found that 89% of IFAs are considering outsourcing to discretionary managers as a result of RDR.
# Several new entrants are making major in-roads into this market at the expense of the incumbent retail-oriented funds groups such as Schroders, Gartmore, Fidelity Investments etc. The larger discretionary fund managers are finding it difficult to adapt their business models to cope with these changes, given that the small average portfolio size is better suited to multi-manager (portfolio of funds) solutions, via wrap platforms, when these fund managers tend to prefer to retain custody and investing in direct equities.

In July 2022, the FCA introduced new Consumer Duty rules.

===2009 regulations===
The Payment Services Regulations 2009 came into force on 1 November 2009 and shifted the onus onto the banks to prove negligence by the holder of debit and credit cards in cases of disputed payments.

On the same date the Banking Conduct Regime commenced.

==Organisation==
The FSA was governed by a Board appointed by HM Treasury. At the time of abolition its executive chairman was Adair Turner. Hector Sants was CEO until the end of June 2012, having announced his resignation on 16 March 2012. The FSA was also provided with advice on the interests and concerns of consumers by the Financial Services Consumer Panel.

== Criticisms ==
The FSA rarely took on wider implication cases. For example, thousands of consumers have complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service about payment protection insurance (PPI) and bank charges. This was despite determining that there was a problem in the selling of PPI.

The FSA in an internal report into the handling of the collapse in confidence of customers of the Northern Rock Plc described themselves as inadequate. It was reported that to prevent such a situation occurring again, the FSA was considering allowing a bank to delay revealing to the public when it gets into financial difficulties.

The FSA was criticised in the final report of the European Parliament&#x27;s inquiry into the crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. It is widely reported that the long-awaited Parliamentary Ombudsman&#x27;s investigation into the government&#x27;s handling of Equitable Life is equally scathing of the FSA&#x27;s handling of this case

The FSA ignored warning signals from Northern Rock building society and continued to allow the bank to operate without a risk mitigation programme for months before the bank&#x27;s collapse.

Despite heavily criticising split-cap investment trusts, in 2007 it suddenly abandoned its investigation.

There were also some questions raised about the competence of FSA staff.

Although one of the prime responsibilities of the FSA was to protect consumers, the FSA was active in trying to ensure companies&#x27; anonymity when they were involved in misselling activity, preferring to side with the companies that have been found guilty rather than consumers.

It was announced in November 2008, that despite self-acknowledged failures by the FSA in effectively regulating the financial services industry, FSA staff would receive bonuses. On 31 May 2008, The Times confirmed that FSA staff had received £20m in bonuses for 2008/09, a 40% increase on the previous year.
On 11 February 2009, FSA deputy chairman, Sir James Crosby resigned after it was revealed that he had fired a whistleblower, Paul Moore, who had warned of dangerous lending practices at HBOS when he had been in charge of risk regulation.

Lord Adair Turner, the then FSA chairman, defended the actions of the regulator on the BBC&#x27;s Andrew Marr show on 13 February 2009. His comments were that other regulatory bodies throughout the world, which had a variety of different structures and which are perceived either as heavy touch or light touch also failed to predict the economic collapse. In line with the other regulators, the FSA had failed intellectually by focusing too much on processes and procedures rather than looking at the bigger economic picture. In response as to why Sir James Crosby had been appointed deputy chairman when his bank HBOS had been highlighted by the FSA as using risky lending practises, Lord Turner said that they had files on almost every financial institution indicating a degree of risk.

Turner faced further criticism from the Treasury Select Committee on 25 February 2009, especially over failures to spot or act on reckless lending by banks before the crisis of 2008 occurred. He attributed much of the blame on the politicians at the time for pressuring the FSA into &quot;light touch&quot; regulation.

On 17 April 2009, a whistleblower (former FSA employee) alleged that the FSA had turned a blind eye to the explosion in purchases of whole sale loans taken on by various UK building societies from 2005 onwards. The FSA denied the claims – &quot;This is not whistleblowing, it is green ink&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;The allegations are a farrago of lies, distortions and half truths made by an obviously disgruntled former employee who clearly has an axe to grind. It does not paint a realistic picture of our supervision of building societies.&quot;
On 18 August 2012, the Treasury Select Committee criticised the FSA for its poor enforcement of the LIBOR rate setting rules.

=== More principles-based regulation ===

There were suggestions that the FSA stifled the UK financial services industry through over-regulation, following a leaked letter from Prime Minister Tony Blair during 2005. This incident led Callum McCarthy, then Chief Executive of the FSA, to formally write to the Prime Minister asking him to either explain his opinions or retract them.

The Prime Minister&#x27;s criticisms were viewed as particularly surprising since the FSA&#x27;s brand of light-touch financial regulation was typically popular with banks and financial institutions in comparison with the more prescriptive rules-based regulation employed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and by other European regulators; by contrast, most critiques of the FSA accused it of instigating a regulatory &quot;race to the bottom&quot; aimed at attracting foreign companies at the expense of consumer protection.

The FSA countered that its move away from rules-based regulation towards more principles-based regulation, far from weakening its consumer protection goals, could in fact strengthen them: &quot;Our Principles are rules. We can take enforcement action on the basis of them; we have already done so; and we intend increasingly to do so where it is appropriate to do so.&quot; As an example, the enforcement action taken in late 2006 against firms mis-selling payment protection insurance was based on their violation of principle six of the FSA&#x27;s Principles for Business, rather than requiring the use of the sort of complex technical regulations that many in financial services find burdensome.

=== Enforcement cases ===

The FSA was criticised for its supposedly weak enforcement program. For example, while FSMA prohibits insider trading, the FSA only successfully prosecuted two insider dealing cases, both involving defendants who did not contest the charges. Likewise, since 2001, the FSA only sought insider trading fines eight times against individuals and companies it regulated, despite the FSA&#x27;s own studies indicating that unexplained price movements occur prior to around 25 percent of all UK corporate merger announcements.

After the HBOS insider trading scandal, the FSA informed MPs on 6 May 2008 that they planned to crack down on inside trading more effectively and that the results of their efforts would be seen in 2008/09 On 22 June, the Daily Telegraph reported that the FSA had wrapped up their case into HBOS insider trading and no action would be taken. On 26 June, the HBOS chairman said that &quot;There is a strong case for believing that the UK is exceptionally bad at dealing with white-collar crime&quot;.

On 29 July 2008, however, it was announced that the Police, acting on information supplied by the FSA, had arrested workers at UBS and JP Morgan Cazenove for alleged insider dealing and that this was the third case within a week.
A year after the subprime mortgage crisis had made global headlines, the FSA levied a record £900,000 on an IFA for selling subprime mortgages.

===Actions relating to the 2007—2009 credit crisis===
The FSA was held by some observers to be weak and inactive in allowing irresponsible banking to precipitate the credit crunch which commenced in 2007, and which has involved the shrinking of the UK housing market, increasing unemployment (especially in the financial and building sectors), the public acquisition of Northern Rock in mid-February 2008, and the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. On 18 September 2008, the FSA announced a ban on short selling to reduce volatility in difficult markets lasting until 16 January 2009.

Certainly, the FSA&#x27;s implementation of capital requirements for banks was lax relative to some other countries. For example, it was reported that Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Bank is measured as having 7.6% Tier 1 capital under the rules of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, but this would be measured as 10.1% if the bank was under the jurisdiction of the FSA.

In March 2009, Lord Turner published a regulatory review of the global financial crisis. The review broadly acknowledges that &#x27;light touch&#x27; regulation had failed and that the FSA should concentrate on macroeconomic regulation as well as scrutinising individual companies. The review also proposed cross-border regulation of banks. There were no further promises to improve consumer protection or to directly intervene against financial institutions who treat their customers badly. The review was reportedly met with widespread relief in the city of London where firms had feared a &#x27;revolution&#x27; in the way that they would be regulated.

<doc id="236447" wikidata="Q210200" url="?curid=236447" title="Eliza Dushku">
<text>Eliza Patricia Dushku (; born December 30, 1980) is an American former actress. She is best known for starring as Faith in the supernatural drama series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1998–2003) and its spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot; (2000–2003). She also had lead roles in the Fox supernatural drama series &quot;Tru Calling&quot; (2003–2005) and the Fox science fiction series &quot;Dollhouse&quot; (2009–2010), for which she was a producer.

Dushku had starring roles in various films, including &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; (1995), &quot;Bring It On&quot; (2000), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), &quot;The New Guy&quot; (2002), &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; (2003), &quot;On Broadway&quot; (2007), &quot;The Scribbler&quot; (2014), &quot;Jane Wants a Boyfriend&quot; (2015), and &quot;Eloise&quot; (2016). She has also done voice work for numerous video games and animated films.

==Early life==
Dushku was born in Boston and raised in Watertown, Massachusetts, the only daughter and youngest of the four children of school teacher and administrator Phillip Dushku and Judy Dushku (), a political science professor. Dushku&#x27;s father was Boston-born, of Albanian heritage, with his parents coming from the city of Korçë, Her parents were divorced before she was born.

Dushku&#x27;s mother was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Dushku and her three brothers were raised as members of the Church. She attended Beaver Country Day School in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and graduated from Watertown High School.

==Career==
===Acting===
====1992–1997: Beginnings and breakthrough====

Dushku came to the attention of casting agents when she was ten years old. She was chosen in a five-month search for the lead role of Alice in the 1992 romantic drama film &quot;That Night&quot;. In 1993, Dushku landed a role as Pearl, alongside Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, in the drama film &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot;. The following year, she played the teenage daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in the action spy film &quot;True Lies&quot;.

She had roles as Piper Reeves in the short film &quot;Fishing with George&quot; (1994), as Cat in the television film &quot;Journey&quot; (1995), as Paul Reiser&#x27;s daughter in the romantic comedy film &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; (1995), and as Cindy Johnson in the comedy drama film &quot;Race the Sun&quot; (1996).

====1998–2002: &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and recognition====
Dushku planned to attend Suffolk University in Boston, where her mother taught, but her agent asked her to submit a videotape audition for a television show starring another of his clients, Sarah Michelle Gellar. After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local Claire&#x27;s to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part of Faith on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. When she began her work on the series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive emancipation to work the production&#x27;s long hours. She later recalled with amusement that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of the show, jokingly said that she would sign the emancipation order if she could get a signed photo from Dushku. Though initially planned as a three-episode role, the character became so popular that she stayed on for the whole third season and returned for a two-part appearance in season four and for the last five episodes of the series. She also appeared in the spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot;.

As an unwelcome effect of her portrayal as Faith, Dushku was inundated with fan mail from prisoners. She said:

I&#x27;ve been getting fan mail from maximum security penitentiaries and death row. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything – disgusting things that you don&#x27;t even want to know about. And they send me pictures – &quot;Oh, here&#x27;s a picture of me before I was incarcerated!&quot; – and there&#x27;s some guy sat on the sofa with a bottle of beer and a mustache, and a big gut. It&#x27;s so creepy. Way more creepy than &quot;Buffy&quot;.
In 2000, Dushku starred in the hit cheerleader comedy &quot;Bring It On&quot;. She followed that up with &quot;Soul Survivors&quot;, which reunited her with her &quot;Race the Sun&quot; co-star Casey Affleck. In 2001, she appeared in &quot;The New Guy&quot; with DJ Qualls and in &quot;City by the Sea&quot; with Robert De Niro and James Franco. The latter film garnered attention from a wider adult audience and several good reviews. The same year, Kevin Smith invited Dushku to be a part of &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;.

====2003–2008: &quot;Tru Calling&quot; and subsequent roles====
In 2003, Dushku starred in the horror film &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; and &quot;The Kiss&quot;, an independent comedy-drama. Starting that same year, she starred in a new Fox supernatural drama, &quot;Tru Calling&quot;, where she played the main character, medical student Tru Davies. After having a grant withdrawn, Tru is forced to take a job at a local morgue, where she discovers her power to &quot;re-live&quot; the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; about Faith.

She has had many roles as a &quot;bad girl&quot; in films. In an interview with &quot;Maxim&quot; in May 2001, Dushku says of her roles, &quot;It&#x27;s easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you&#x27;ve been told not to do, and you don&#x27;t have to deal with the consequences, because it&#x27;s only acting.&quot;

Dushku starred in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Dog Sees God&quot; in December 2005. The play was based on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, with Dushku playing a character symbolizing Lucy Van Pelt. She quit in February 2006 along with other members of the cast amid rumors of abuse by the producer, which were later dismissed.

She played the lead character on &quot;Nurses&quot;, a hospital comedy-drama for Fox. This was the second Fox pilot in which she was cast, but not broadcast.

She appeared in the Simple Plan music video &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Kid&quot; as the band&#x27;s love interest, as well as Nickelback&#x27;s video for &quot;Rockstar&quot;.
On October 1, 2005, she announced at Wizard World Boston that shooting had begun for &quot;Nobel Son&quot; in which she would star with Alan Rickman, Danny DeVito, and Bill Pullman. The film was released at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. Another project released in 2007 was &quot;On Broadway&quot;, an independent film filmed in Boston. It received positive reviews, with a few of them highlighting Dushku&#x27;s performance.

Dushku has had roles in five video games. She voiced the role of Yumi Sawamura in the English-language version of &quot;Yakuza&quot; for the PlayStation 2, which was published and developed by Sega, and released in September 2006. Dushku also stars as Shaundi, one of the lead characters in &quot;Saints Row 2&quot;, which was developed by Volition, Inc. and published by THQ. It was released in North America on October 14, 2008, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. She was the voice talent for the role of Rubi Malone, the main character in the game &quot;WET&quot;. She appeared at Spike TV&#x27;s 2008 Video Game Awards in December 2008. Danielle Nicolet took over the role of Shaundi in &quot;Saints Row: The Third&quot;. She also voiced Megan McQueen in Champion Mode of the 2011 video game Fight Night Champion.

&quot;Variety&quot; announced on August 2, 2006, that Dushku would co-star with Macaulay Culkin in &quot;Sex and Breakfast&quot;, a dark comedy written and directed by Miles Brandman. A reviewer described Dushku as &quot;charming&quot; and giving the character &quot;an edge&quot;. The film was released in Los Angeles on November 30, 2007, and on DVD on January 22, 2008. She starred in &quot;Open Graves&quot;, a 2008 horror-thriller about a satanic game co-starring Mike Vogel. She played the main character in &quot;The Thacker Case&quot; and &quot;The Alphabet Killer&quot;, both thrillers based on real-life events, one of them directed by Rob Schmidt, with whom she had worked on &quot;Wrong Turn&quot;. Both films were released in 2008. &quot;The Alphabet Killer&quot; contains Dushku&#x27;s first topless scene. The film earned mixed reviews, but reviewers praised Dushku&#x27;s performance, commenting &quot;Eliza Dushku commands the screen but cannot reconcile the script&#x27;s conflicted and increasingly idiotic agendas.&quot; She appeared in &quot;Bottle Shock&quot;, a drama about Napa valley wine. The film was directed by Randall Miller, who helmed &quot;Nobel Son&quot;.

====2009–2017: &quot;Dollhouse&quot; and other work====
On August 26, 2007, Dushku signed a development deal with Fox Broadcasting Company and 20th Century Fox. Under the pact, the network and the studio would develop projects tailor-made for the actress as well as approach her with existing pitches and scripts.

Subsequently, it was announced on October 31 that Dushku had lured Joss Whedon, of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, back to TV, to create a television series called &quot;Dollhouse&quot;. Dushku produced the show and played the main character, &#x27;Echo&#x27;. It aired on Fox during the 2008–09 TV season. In an interview, Dushku talked about how &quot;Dollhouse&quot; and her reconnection with Whedon came about:

I invited Joss Whedon to lunch after I did the business deal with Fox. We&#x27;d had a cool relationship in the past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn&#x27;t called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we&#x27;ve become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I was a little bit of a wild child. He&#x27;s watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.
Dushku described Whedon as &quot;my favorite genius ... favorite friend ... big brother ... and the only person out here I&#x27;ve ever wholeheartedly trusted, because he&#x27;s never let me down.&quot; &quot;Dollhouse&quot; was renewed for a second season. The producers cited their confidence in the strength of Whedon&#x27;s fan base and high DVR numbers as their reasons for keeping the show. Fox cancelled &quot;Dollhouse&quot; on November 11, 2009. The show officially wrapped filming on the second and final season on December 16, 2009.

Dushku was the voice actor for contract killer &quot;Rubi Malone&quot; in the action video game &quot;Wet&quot;.

In 2010, Dushku provided her voice for &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark: The New Beginning&quot; and appeared in the film &quot;Locked In&quot;. She also guest-starred in an episode of CBS&#x27; comedy &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;
which aired on November 4, 2010. In 2011, Dushku featured alongside Jayson Floyd in &quot;One Shot&quot;, a short action clip on YouTube directed by and starring Freddie Wong, released on May 13, 2011.

Dushku had a lead role in the online animated &quot;motion comic&quot; series &quot;Torchwood: Web of Lies&quot;, based on the BBC series &quot;&quot;. In June 2012, Dushku starred with Katie Cassidy, Gina Gershon and Michelle Trachtenberg in &quot;The Scribbler&quot;, directed by John Suits and produced by Gabriel Cowan.

In 2013, she was cast as Patricia Holm in a pilot film for a proposed TV revival series of &quot;The Saint&quot;, but the series was not commissioned. In July 2017 the pilot was released on digital HD/VOD.

From 2013 to 2015, Dushku voiced the role of She-Hulk in the Disney XD animated series &quot;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&quot;. In 2014, it was announced that she would star in Randall Miller&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Rider&quot;, a biopic of Gregg Allman. In 2016, she was cast in a recurring role in the fourth season of the Cinemax TV series &quot;Banshee&quot;. In 2017, she had a recurring guest role in the last three episodes of the first season of the CBS drama series &quot;Bull&quot; with the option of becoming a series regular in season two.

After a seven year hiatus, Dushku confirmed her retirement from acting in September 2024.

===Production work===

In August 2011, Dushku visited Albania with a crew from the Travel Channel and Lonely Planet to film &quot;Dear Albania&quot;, a documentary promoting tourism in her father&#x27;s family&#x27;s country of origin.

Dushku has been CEO of her own production company, Boston Diva Productions, with her brother Nate as a partner. She secured exclusive rights to make an authorized film based on the life of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. At one time provisionally entitled &quot;The Perfect Moment&quot;, the film was in development over more than a decade. Eventually she enlisted the help of Ondi Timoner and Mapplethorpe, with Matt Smith as the title character, was brought to the screen in 2018.

In 2017, her production company, in association with IM Global Television, was reported to be developing Glen Cook&#x27;s &quot;The Black Company&quot; series of books for a television series, with Dushku potentially starring as The Lady.

==Personal life==
Dushku was raised a Mormon, and still has a Mormon-themed tattoo. She describes herself as having taken a different path from the LDS Church, and is grateful for having grown up in it.

Dushku lived for more than 15 years in Los Angeles, though spending substantial time back in Watertown and Boston in the period before her stepfather died. She lived for several years in the Laurel Canyon area.

In 2009, she posed nude for the May issue of &quot;Allure&quot; magazine.

Having originally intended to attend college in Boston, before her break on &quot;Buffy&quot; altered those plans, she announced in March 2014 at the Emerald City Comicon that she would be attending college later that year. On June 22, 2014, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that Dushku had left Los Angeles, moved back to Watertown near Boston, and was planning to attend college. As of 2016, she was a student at Suffolk University, studying sociology. In 2019, &quot;Boston Magazine&quot; reported that she was studying holistic psychology at Lesley University. She graduated in 2020. In 2023, it was reported by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that Dushku was studying for her masters degree in counseling and clinical mental health, with a focus on psychedelic-assisted therapies and treatment for addiction and mental health.

During an interview with &quot;Boston Magazine&quot; in September 2024, Dushku claimed that she has become a certified therapist, primarily focusing on psychedelic therapy for trauma patients, and she has also become an advocate for the use of psychedelic drugs in mental health treatment.

She is politically active and campaigned for Bernie Sanders in the U.S. presidential election of 2016.
===Relationships===
Dushku began dating former Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers basketball player Rick Fox in October 2009, and in August 2010 the couple confirmed that they were living together. It was announced on June 24, 2014, that the pair had split.

In June 2017, she became engaged to businessman Peter Palandjian and they wed on August 18, 2018. On August 1, 2019, Dushku announced the birth of the couple&#x27;s son. In February 2021, Dushku announced via Instagram that she was pregnant with her second child. In August 2021, Dushku gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second son.

===Activism===
Dushku serves on the board of directors of the THRIVE-Gulu organization (The Trauma Healing and Reflection Center in Gulu), an organization dedicated to helping the survivors of war (including former child soldiers) in Northern Uganda, which her mother and stepfather co-founded. She raised US$30,000 for the land for the center&#x27;s building, and has performed other fundraising activities, as well as helping out in the center itself.

As a role model to campus leaders for her activism, Dushku was invited by the Millennium Campus Network (MCN) as a national keynote speaker and honored as a Global Generation Award winner alongside U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at MCN events in 2011.

Over several years, Dushku raised funds for Camp Hale, which had been attended by her father and brothers, including some specific campaigning to sustain a new concept of a girls&#x27; session at the camp, which was launched in 2012, and which she joined in person.

===Albanian citizenship===
Dushku visited her father&#x27;s family and their home city in Albania in 2006 after receiving an invitation from Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha. She also visited Kosovo, and got an Albanian Eagle tattoo on the back of her neck. While on her second visit to Albania in 2011, she applied for Albanian citizenship and obtained the Albanian passport and ID Card. Dushku became an honorary citizen of Tirana, and was given the honorary title of Tirana Ambassador of Culture and Tourism in the World by Tirana mayor Lulzim Basha. Additionally, she was given honorary citizen status in her father&#x27;s home town of Korçë. She and her brother Nate produced a film about a joint visit to Albania, &quot;Dear Albania&quot;.
===Sexual molestation and harassment allegations===
In January 2018, Dushku publicly alleged having been molested by stunt coordinator Joel Kramer when she was 12 and working on &quot;True Lies&quot;. She wrote that soon after, an adult friend of Dushku confronted Kramer on set, and that the same day, Dushku was injured during a stunt and several of her ribs were broken, while Kramer was responsible for her safety. Kramer has denied the accusation of sexual misconduct.

In January 2019, CBS made a $9.5 million settlement with Dushku after she was fired from a recurring role on &quot;Bull&quot;, after informing producers of series lead Michael Weatherly&#x27;s alleged inappropriate behavior on the set. According to documents from the official mediation, Weatherly was recorded on video making comments about spanking Dushku over his knee, soliciting a threesome, alluding to sexual assault in his &quot;rape van&quot;, and other harassing statements. After Dushku spoke with the producers, Weatherly texted CBS Television Studios&#x27; president David Stapf saying he wanted to talk about Dushku&#x27;s sense of humor, though Stapf pushed back saying &quot;Ms. Dushku made the show better.&quot; Days later, showrunner Glenn Caron terminated Dushku&#x27;s expected role on the show, despite opposition from studio executives. The settlement amount was calculated to compensate Dushku for her loss of earnings from her planned promotion to a series regular, with &quot;well-developed plans&quot; set to make her a regular cast member following her three-episode guest appearance. In December 2018, when the settlement was reported, Weatherly publicly apologized for the comments. Dushku responded that Weatherly broke the terms of their settlement by speaking to the press and characterized his apology as &quot;more deflection, denial, and spin&quot;. In November 2021, Dushku testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee about her sexual harassment accusations during her time on &quot;Bull&quot;.

In February 2021, Dushku shared a message of support for Charisma Carpenter, in reference to allegations of abuse against &quot;Buffy&quot; creator Joss Whedon.

===Health===
Dushku has said that she has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). She announced in December 2011 that she switched to a vegan diet after watching the documentary &quot;Forks Over Knives&quot;. In December 2014, she said she was no longer a vegetarian. On March 7, 2017, Dushku attended a Youth Summit on Opioid Awareness, where she revealed that she was a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, having begun drinking and abusing drugs at the age of 14. She said her addictions were at one point so serious that her brother forbade her from being left alone with her niece, his daughter Sofia, and that she was eight-and-a-half years sober.

<text>Sleep paralysis is a state, during waking up or falling asleep, in which a person is conscious but in a complete state of full-body paralysis. During an episode, the person may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there), which often results in fear. Episodes generally last no more than a few minutes. It can recur multiple times or occur as a single episode.
The condition may occur in those who are otherwise healthy or those with narcolepsy, or it may run in families as a result of specific genetic changes. The condition can be triggered by sleep deprivation, psychological stress, or abnormal sleep cycles. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a dysfunction in REM sleep. Diagnosis is based on a person&#x27;s description. Other conditions that can present similarly include narcolepsy, atonic seizure, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.

Treatment options for sleep paralysis have been poorly studied. It is recommended that people be reassured that the condition is common and generally not serious. Other efforts that may be tried include sleep hygiene, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressants.
Between 8% and 50% of people experience sleep paralysis at some point during their lives. About 5% of people have regular episodes. Males and females are affected equally. Sleep paralysis has been described throughout history. It is believed to have played a role in the creation of stories about alien abduction and other paranormal events.

== Symptoms and signs==
The main symptom of sleep paralysis is being unable to move or speak during awakening.

Imagined sounds such as humming, hissing, static, zapping and buzzing noises are reported during sleep paralysis. Other sounds such as voices, whispers and roars are also experienced. It has also been known that one may feel pressure on their chest and intense pain in their head during an episode. These symptoms are usually accompanied by intense emotions such as fear and panic. People also have sensations of being dragged out of bed or of flying, numbness, and feelings of electric tingles or vibrations running through their body.

Sleep paralysis may include hallucinations, such as an intruding presence or dark figure in the room. These are commonly known as sleep paralysis demons. It may also include suffocating or the individual feeling a sense of terror, accompanied by a feeling of pressure on one&#x27;s chest and difficulty breathing.

== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiology of sleep paralysis has not been concretely identified, although there are several theories about its cause. The first of these stems from the understanding that sleep paralysis is a parasomnia resulting from dysfunctional overlap of the REM and waking stages of sleep. Polysomnographic studies found that individuals who experience sleep paralysis have shorter REM sleep latencies than normal along with shortened NREM and REM sleep cycles, and fragmentation of REM sleep. This study supports the observation that disturbance of regular sleeping patterns can precipitate an episode of sleep paralysis, because fragmentation of REM sleep commonly occurs when sleep patterns are disrupted and has now been seen in combination with sleep paralysis.

Another major theory is that the neural functions that regulate sleep are out of balance, causing different sleep states to overlap. In this case, cholinergic sleep &quot;on&quot; neural populations are hyperactivated and the serotonergic sleep &quot;off&quot; neural populations are under-activated. As a result, the cells capable of sending the signals that would allow for complete arousal from the sleep state, the serotonergic neural populations, have difficulty in overcoming the signals sent by the cells that keep the brain in the sleep state. During normal REM sleep, the threshold for a stimulus to cause arousal is greatly elevated. Under normal conditions, medial and vestibular nuclei, cortical, thalamic, and cerebellar centers coordinate things such as head and eye movement, and orientation in space.

In individuals reporting sleep paralysis, there is almost no blocking of exogenous stimuli, which means it is much easier for a stimulus to arouse the individual. The vestibular nuclei in particular has been identified as being closely related to dreaming during the REM stage of sleep. According to this hypothesis, vestibular-motor disorientation, unlike hallucinations, arise from completely endogenous sources of stimuli.

If the effects of sleep &quot;on&quot; neural populations cannot be counteracted, characteristics of REM sleep are retained upon awakening. Common consequences of sleep paralysis include headaches, muscle pains or weakness or paranoia. As the correlation with REM sleep suggests, the paralysis is not complete: use of EOG traces shows that eye movement is still possible during such episodes; however, the individual experiencing sleep paralysis is unable to speak.

Research has found a genetic component in sleep paralysis. The characteristic fragmentation of REM sleep, hypnopompic, and hypnagogic hallucinations have a heritable component in other parasomnias, which lends credence to the idea that sleep paralysis is also genetic. Twin studies have shown that if one twin of a monozygotic pair (identical twins) experiences sleep paralysis that other twin is very likely to experience it as well. The identification of a genetic component means that there is some sort of disruption of a function at the physiological level. Further studies must be conducted to determine whether there is a mistake in the signaling pathway for arousal as suggested by the first theory presented, or whether the regulation of melatonin or the neural populations themselves have been disrupted.

===Hallucinations===
Several types of hallucinations have been linked to sleep paralysis: the belief that there is an intruder in the room, the feeling of a presence, and the sensation of floating. One common hallucination is the presence of an incubus. A neurological hypothesis is that in sleep paralysis the cerebellum, which usually coordinates body movement and provides information on body position, experiences a brief myoclonic spike in brain activity inducing a floating sensation.

The intruder and incubus hallucinations highly correlate with one another, and moderately correlated with the third hallucination, vestibular-motor disorientation, also known as out-of-body experiences, which differ from the other two in not involving the threat-activated vigilance system.

=== Threat hyper-vigilance ===
A hyper-vigilant state created in the midbrain may further contribute to hallucinations. More specifically, the emergency response is activated in the brain when individuals wake up paralyzed and feel vulnerable to attack. This helplessness can intensify the effects of the threat response well above the level typical of normal dreams, which could explain why such visions during sleep paralysis are so vivid. The threat-activated vigilance system is a protective mechanism that differentiates between dangerous situations and determines whether the fear response is appropriate.

The hyper-vigilance response can lead to the creation of endogenous stimuli that contribute to the perceived threat. A similar process may explain hallucinations, with slight variations, in which an evil presence is perceived by the subject to be attempting to suffocate them, either by pressing heavily on the chest or by strangulation. A neurological explanation holds that this results from a combination of the threat vigilance activation system and the muscle paralysis associated with sleep paralysis that removes voluntary control of breathing. Several features of REM breathing patterns exacerbate the feeling of suffocation. These include shallow rapid breathing, hypercapnia, and slight blockage of the airway, which is a symptom prevalent in sleep apnea patients.

According to this account, the subjects attempt to breathe deeply and find themselves unable to do so, creating a sensation of resistance, which the threat-activated vigilance system interprets as an unearthly being sitting on their chest, threatening suffocation. The sensation of entrapment causes a feedback loop when the fear of suffocation increases as a result of continued helplessness, causing the subjects to struggle to end the SP episode.

== Diagnosis ==
Sleep paralysis is mainly diagnosed via clinical interview and ruling out other potential sleep disorders that could account for the feelings of paralysis. Several measures are available to reliably diagnose or screen (&quot;Munich Parasomnia Screening&quot;) for recurrent isolated sleep paralysis.

=== Diagnosis ===
Episodes of sleep paralysis can occur in the context of several medical conditions (e.g., narcolepsy, hypokalemia). When episodes occur independent of these conditions or substance use, it is termed &quot;isolated sleep paralysis&quot; (ISP). When ISP episodes are more frequent and cause clinically significant distress or interference, it is classified as &quot;recurrent isolated sleep paralysis&quot; (RISP). Episodes of sleep paralysis, regardless of classification, are generally short (1–6 minutes), but longer episodes have been documented.

It can be difficult to differentiate between cataplexy brought on by narcolepsy and true sleep paralysis, because the two phenomena are physically indistinguishable. The best way to differentiate between the two is to note when the attacks occur most often. Narcolepsy attacks are more common when the individual is falling asleep; ISP and RISP attacks are more common upon awakening.

===Differential diagnosis===

Similar conditions include:
* Exploding head syndrome (EHS) potentially frightening parasomnia, the hallucinations are usually briefer and always loud or jarring. There is no paralysis during EHS.
* Nightmare disorder (ND); also REM-based parasomnia.
* Sleep terrors (STs) are potentially frightening parasomnia, but are not REM based and there is a lack of awareness to surroundings, characteristic screams during STs.
* Noctural panic attacks (NPAs) involve fear and acute distress but lack paralysis and dream imagery.
* Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often includes scary imagery and anxiety but not limited to sleep-wake transitions.

== Prevention ==
Several circumstances have been identified that are associated with an increased risk of sleep paralysis. These include insomnia, sleep deprivation, an erratic sleep schedule, stress, and physical fatigue. It is also believed that there may be a genetic component in the development of RISP, because there is a high concurrent incidence of sleep paralysis in monozygotic twins. Sleeping in the supine position has been found an especially prominent instigator of sleep paralysis.

Sleeping in the supine position is believed to make the sleeper more vulnerable to episodes of sleep paralysis because in this sleeping position it is possible for the soft palate to collapse and obstruct the airway. This is a possibility regardless of whether the individual has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or not. There may also be a greater rate of microarousals while sleeping in the supine position because there is a greater amount of pressure being exerted on the lungs by gravity.

While many factors can increase the risk for ISP or RISP, they can be avoided with minor lifestyle changes.

== Treatment ==
Medical treatment starts with education about sleep stages and the inability to move muscles during REM sleep. People should be evaluated for narcolepsy if symptoms persist. The safest treatment for sleep paralysis is for people to adopt healthier sleeping habits. However, in more serious cases tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used. Despite the fact that these treatments are prescribed there is currently no drug that has been found to completely interrupt episodes of sleep paralysis a majority of the time.

=== Medications ===
Though no large trials have taken place which focus on the treatment of sleep paralysis, several drugs have promise in case studies. Two trials of GHB for people with narcolepsy demonstrated reductions in sleep paralysis episodes.

Pimavanserin has been proposed as a possible candidate for future studies in treating sleep paralysis.

=== Cognitive-behavior therapy ===
Some of the earliest work in treating sleep paralysis was done using a cognitive-behavior therapy called CA-CBT. The work focuses on psycho-education and modifying catastrophic cognitions about the sleep paralysis attack. This approach has previously been used to treat sleep paralysis in Egypt, although clinical trials are lacking.

The first published psychosocial treatment for recurrent isolated sleep paralysis was cognitive-behavior therapy for isolated sleep paralysis (CBT-ISP). It begins with self-monitoring of symptoms, cognitive restructuring of maladaptive thoughts relevant to ISP (e.g., &quot;the paralysis will be permanent&quot;), and psychoeducation about the nature of sleep paralysis. Prevention techniques include ISP-specific sleep hygiene and the preparatory use of various relaxation techniques (e.g. diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation). Episode disruption techniques are first practiced in session and then applied during actual attacks. No controlled trial of CBT-ISP has yet been conducted to prove its effectiveness.

== Epidemiology ==
Sleep paralysis is experienced equally in males and females. Lifetime prevalence rates derived from 35 aggregated studies indicate that approximately 8% of the general population, 28% of students, and 32% of psychiatric patients experience at least one episode of sleep paralysis at some point in their lives. Rates of recurrent sleep paralysis are not as well known, but 15–45% of those with a lifetime history of sleep paralysis may meet diagnostic criteria for Recurrent Isolated Sleep Paralysis. In surveys from Canada, China, England, Japan and Nigeria, 20% to 60% of individuals reported having experienced sleep paralysis at least once in their lifetime. In general, non-whites appear to experience sleep paralysis at higher rates than whites, but the magnitude of the difference is rather small. Approximately 36% of the general population that experiences isolated sleep paralysis develop it between 25 and 44 years of age.

Isolated sleep paralysis is commonly seen in patients that have been diagnosed with narcolepsy. Approximately 30–50% of people that have been diagnosed with narcolepsy have experienced sleep paralysis as an auxiliary symptom. A majority of the individuals who have experienced sleep paralysis have sporadic episodes that occur once a month to once a year. Only 3% of individuals experiencing sleep paralysis that is not associated with a neuromuscular disorder have nightly episodes.

== Society and culture ==
=== Etymology ===

The original definition of sleep paralysis was codified by Samuel Johnson in his &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; as &quot;nightmare&quot;, a term that evolved into the modern definition. The term was first used and dubbed by British neurologist, S.A.K. Wilson in his 1928 dissertation, &quot;The Narcolepsies.&quot; Such sleep paralysis was widely considered the work of demons, and more specifically incubi, which were thought to sit on the chests of sleepers. In Old English the name for these beings was &quot;mare&quot; or &quot;mære&quot; (from a proto-Germanic &quot;*marōn&quot;, cf. Old Norse &quot;mara&quot;), hence comes the &quot;mare&quot; in the word &quot;nightmare&quot;. The word might be cognate to Greek &quot;Marōn&quot; (in the Odyssey) and Sanskrit &quot;Māra&quot;.

=== Cultural significance and priming ===
Although the core features of sleep paralysis (e.g., atonia, a clear sensorium, and frequent hallucinations) appear to be universal, the ways in which they are experienced vary according to time, place, and culture. Over 100 terms have been identified for these experiences. Some scientists have proposed sleep paralysis as an explanation for reports of paranormal and spiritual phenomena such as ghosts, alien visits, demons or demonic possession, alien abduction experiences, the night hag and shadow people haunting.

According to some scientists, culture may be a major factor in shaping sleep paralysis. When sleep paralysis is interpreted through a particular cultural filter, it may take on greater salience. For example, if sleep paralysis is feared in a certain culture, this fear could lead to conditioned fear, and thus worsen the experience, in turn leading to higher rates. Consistent with this idea, high rates and long durations of immobility during sleep paralysis have been found in Egypt, where there are elaborate beliefs about sleep paralysis, involving malevolent spirit-like creatures, the &quot;jinn.&quot;

Research has found that sleep paralysis is associated with great fear and fear of impending death in 50% of sufferers in Egypt. A study comparing rates and characteristics of sleep paralysis in Egypt and Denmark found that the phenomenon is three times more common in Egypt than Denmark. In Denmark, unlike Egypt, there are no elaborate supernatural beliefs about sleep paralysis, and the experience is often interpreted as an odd physiological event, with overall shorter sleep paralysis episodes and fewer people (17%) fearing that they could die from it.

=== Folklore ===

The night hag is a generic name for a folkloric creature found in cultures around the world, and which is used to explain the phenomenon of sleep paralysis. A common description is that a person feels a presence of a supernatural malevolent being which immobilizes the person as if standing on the chest. This phenomenon goes by many names.

==== Albania ====
In Albanian folk beliefs, &quot;Mokthi&quot; is believed to be a male spirit with a golden fez hat who appears to women who are usually tired or suffering and stops them from moving. It is believed that if they can take his golden hat, he will grant them a wish, but then he will visit them frequently although he is harmless. There are talismans that can provide protection from Mokthi and one way is to put one&#x27;s husband&#x27;s hat near the pillow while sleeping. &quot;Mokthi&quot; or &quot;Makthi&quot; in Albanian means &quot;Nightmare&quot;.

==== Bengal ====
In Bengali folklore, sleep paralysis is believed to be caused by a supernatural entity called &quot;Boba&quot; (). &quot;Boba&quot; attacks a person by strangling him when the person sleeps in a supine position. In Bengal, the phenomenon is called &quot;Bobay Dhora&quot; ().

==== Cambodia ====
Sleep paralysis among Cambodians is known as &quot;the ghost pushes you down,&quot; and entails the belief in dangerous visitations from deceased relatives.

==== Egypt ====
In Egypt, sleep paralysis is conceptualized as a terrifying &quot;jinn&quot; attack&quot;.&quot;

==== Italy ====
In the different regions of Italy there are many examples of supernatural beings associated with sleep paralysis. In the regions of Marche and Abruzzo, it is referred to as a &#x27; or &#x27; attack; the &quot;Pandafeche&quot; usually refers to an evil witch, sometimes a ghostlike spirit or a terrifying catlike creature, that mounts on the chest of the victim and tries to harm him. The only way to avoid her is to keep a bag of sand or beans close to the bed, so that the witch will stop to count how many beans or sand-grains are inside it. A similar tradition is present in the Sardinian folklore, where the &quot;Ammuntadore&quot; is known as a creature that mounts on the people&#x27;s chest during their sleep to give them nightmares, and that can change its shape according to the person&#x27;s fears. In Northern Italy, specifically in the Tyrol area, the &quot;Trud&quot; is a witch that sits on the people&#x27;s chest at night, making them unable to breathe; to chase her away, people should make the sign of the Cross, something that would need a great struggle in a situation of paralysis. A similar folklore is present in the Sannio area, around the city of Benevento, where the witch is called &quot;Janara&quot;. In Southern Italy, sleep paralysis is usually explained with the presence of a sprite standing on the people&#x27;s chest: if the person manages to catch the sprite (or steal his hat), in exchange for his freedom (or to have his hat back) he can reveal the hiding place of a rich treasure; this sprite has different names in different regions of Italy: Monaciello in Campania, Monachicchio in Basilicata, Laurieddhu or Scazzamurill in Apulia, Mazzmuredd in Molise.

==== Newfoundland ====
In Newfoundland, which is in eastern Canada, sleep paralysis is referred to as the Old Hag, and victims of a &quot;hagging&quot; are said to be &quot;hag-ridden&quot; upon awakening. Victims report being completely conscious, but unable to speak or move, and report a person or an animal which sits upon their chest. Despite the name, the attacker can be either male or female. Some suggested cures or preventions for the Old Hag include sleeping with a Bible under the pillow, calling the sleeper&#x27;s name backwards or in an extreme example, sleeping with a shingle or board embedded with nails strapped to the chest. This object was called a Hag Board. The Old Hag is well-enough known in the province to be a pop culture figure, appearing in films and plays as well as in crafted objects.

====Nigeria====
Nigeria has myriad interpretations of the cause of sleep paralysis, due to numerous cultures and belief systems that exist there.

==== United States ====
Sleep paralysis is sometimes interpreted as space alien abduction in the United States.

=== Literature ===
Various forms of magic and spiritual possession were also advanced as causes in literature. In nineteenth century Europe, the vagaries of diet were thought to be responsible. For example, in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, Ebenezer Scrooge attributes the ghost he sees to &quot;... an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato...&quot; In a similar vein, the &quot;Household Cyclopedia&quot; (1881) offers the following advice about nightmares:

Great attention is to be paid to regularity and choice of diet. Intemperance of every kind is hurtful, but nothing is more productive of this disease than drinking bad wine. Of eatables those which are most prejudicial are all fat and greasy meats and pastry... Moderate exercise contributes in a superior degree to promote the digestion of food and prevent flatulence; those, however, who are necessarily confined to a sedentary occupation, should particularly avoid applying themselves to study or bodily labor immediately after eating... Going to bed before the usual hour is a frequent cause of night-mare, as it either occasions the patient to sleep too long or to lie long awake in the night. Passing a whole night or part of a night without rest likewise gives birth to the disease, as it occasions the patient, on the succeeding night, to sleep too soundly. Indulging in sleep too late in the morning, is an almost certain method to bring on the paroxysm, and the more frequently it returns, the greater strength it acquires; the propensity to sleep at this time is almost irresistible.

J. M. Barrie, the author of the Peter Pan stories, may have had sleep paralysis. He said of himself &quot;In my early boyhood it was a sheet that tried to choke me in the night.&quot; He also described several incidents in the Peter Pan stories that indicate that he was familiar with an awareness of a loss of muscle tone whilst in a dream-like state. For example, Maimie is asleep but calls out &quot;What was that...It is coming nearer! It is feeling your bed with its horns-it is boring for [into] you&quot;, and when the Darling children were dreaming of flying, Barrie says &quot;Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.&quot; Barrie describes many parasomnias and neurological symptoms in his books and uses them to explore the nature of consciousness from an experiential point of view.

=== Documentary films ===
&quot;The Nightmare&quot; is a 2015 documentary that discusses the causes of sleep paralysis as seen through extensive interviews with participants, and the experiences are re-enacted by professional actors. In synopsis, it proposes that such cultural phenomena as alien abduction, the near-death experience and shadow people can, in many cases, be attributed to sleep paralysis. The &quot;real-life&quot; horror film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2015, and premiered in theatres on June 5, 2015.

<text>James Keir Hardie (15 August 185626 September 1915) was a Scottish trade unionist and politician. He was a founder of the Labour Party, and was its first parliamentary leader from 1906 to 1908.

Hardie was born in Newhouse, Lanarkshire. He started working at the age of seven, and from the age of 10 worked in the Lanarkshire coal mines. With a background in preaching, he became known as a talented public speaker and was chosen as a spokesman for his fellow miners. In 1879, Hardie was elected leader of a miners&#x27; union in Hamilton and organised a National Conference of Miners in Dunfermline. He subsequently led miners&#x27; strikes in Lanarkshire (1880) and Ayrshire (1881). He turned to journalism to make ends meet, and from 1886 was a full-time union organiser as secretary of the Ayrshire Miners&#x27; Union.

Hardie initially supported William Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal Party, but later concluded that the working class needed its own party. He first stood for parliament in 1888 as an independent, and later that year helped form the Scottish Labour Party. Hardie won the English seat of West Ham South as an independent candidate in 1892, and helped to form the Independent Labour Party (ILP) the following year. He lost his seat in 1895, but was re-elected to Parliament in 1900 for Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales. In the same year he helped to form the union-based Labour Representation Committee, which was later renamed the Labour Party.

After the 1906 election, Hardie was chosen as the Labour Party&#x27;s first parliamentary leader. He resigned in 1908 in favour of Arthur Henderson, and spent his remaining years campaigning for causes such as women&#x27;s suffrage, self-rule for India, and opposition to World War I. He died in 1915 while attempting to organise a pacifist general strike. Hardie is seen as a key figure in the history of the Labour Party and has been the subject of multiple biographies. Kenneth O. Morgan has called him &quot;Labour&#x27;s greatest pioneer and its greatest hero&quot;.

==Early life==

James Keir Hardie was born on 15 August 1856 in a two-roomed cottage on the western edge of Newhouse, Lanarkshire near Holytown, a small town close to Motherwell in Scotland. His mother, Mary Keir, was a domestic servant and his stepfather, David Hardie, was a ship&#x27;s carpenter. Hardie had little or no contact with his biological father, a miner from Lanarkshire named William Aitken. The growing family soon moved to the shipbuilding burgh of Govan near Glasgow (which wasn&#x27;t incorporated into the city until 1912), where they made a life in a very difficult financial situation, with his stepfather attempting to maintain continuous employment in the shipyards rather than practising his trade at sea – never an easy proposition given the boom-and-bust cycle of the industry.

Hardie&#x27;s first job, when aged seven, was as a message boy for the Anchor Line Steamship Company. Formal schooling henceforth became impossible, but his parents spent evenings teaching him to read and write, skills which proved essential for future self-education. A series of low-paying entry-level jobs followed for the boy, including work as an apprentice in a brass-fitting shop, work for a lithographer, employment in the shipyards heating rivets, and time spent as a message boy for a baker for which he earned four shillings and sixpence a week.

A great lockout of the Clydeside shipworkers took place in which the unionised workers were sent home for six months. With their main source of income terminated, the family was forced to sell all their possessions to pay for food, with Hardie&#x27;s meagre earnings the only remaining source of income for the household. One sibling took ill and died in the miserable conditions which followed, while the pregnancy of his mother limited her ability to work. Making matters worse, young James lost his job for turning up late on two occasions. In desperation, his stepfather returned to work at sea, while his mother moved from Glasgow to Newarthill, where his maternal grandmother still lived.

At the age of ten years old, Hardie went to work in the mines as a &quot;trapper&quot;: opening and closing a door for a ten-hour shift to maintain the air supply for miners in a given section. Hardie also began to attend night school in Holytown at this time.

Hardie&#x27;s stepfather returned from sea and went to work on a railway line being constructed between Edinburgh and Glasgow. When this job was completed, the family moved to the village of Quarter, Lanarkshire, where Hardie went to work as a pony driver at the mines, later working his way into the pits as a hewer. He also worked for two years above ground in the quarries. Around this time he encountered Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;, which he read until &quot;the spirit of it somewhat entered into me&quot;. This was an early and enduring influence on his radicalism and pacifism. By the time he was twenty, he had become a skilled practical miner.

&quot;Keir&quot;, as he was now called, longed for a life outside the mines. To that end, encouraged by his mother, he learned to read and write in shorthand. He also began to associate with the Evangelical Union becoming a member of the Evangelical Union Church, Park Street, Hamilton – now the United Reformed Church, Hamilton (which also incorporates St James&#x27; Congregational Church, attended by the young David Livingstone, the future famous missionary explorer) – and to participate in the Temperance movement. Hardie&#x27;s avocation of preaching put him before crowds of his fellows, helping him to learn the art of public speaking. Before long, Hardie was looked to by other miners as a logical chairman for their meetings and spokesman for their grievances. Mine owners began to see him as an agitator and in fairly short order, he and two younger brothers were blacklisted from working in the local mining industry.

==Union leader==

The 23-year-old Hardie moved from the coal mines to union organisation work.

In May 1879, Scottish mine owners combined to force a reduction of wages, which had the effect of spurring the demand for unionisation. Huge meetings were held weekly at Hamilton as mine workers joined to vent their grievances. On 3 July 1879, Hardie was appointed Corresponding Secretary of the miners, a post which gave him opportunity to get in touch with other representatives of the mine workers throughout southern Scotland. Three weeks later, Hardie was chosen by the miners as their delegate to a National Conference of Miners to be held in Glasgow. He was appointed Miners&#x27; Agent in August 1879 and his new career as a trade union organiser and functionary was launched.

On 16 October 1879, Hardie attended a National Conference of miners at Dunfermline, at which he was selected as National Secretary, a high-sounding title which preceded the establishment of a coherent national organisation by several years. Hardie was active in the strike wave which swept the region in 1880, including a generalised strike of the mines of Lanarkshire that summer which lasted six weeks. The fledgling union had no money but worked to gather foodstuffs for striking mine families, as Hardie and other union agents got local merchants to supply goods upon promise of future payment. A soup kitchen was kept running in Hardie&#x27;s home during the strike, manned by his new wife, the former Lillie Wilson.

While the Lanarkshire mine strike was a failure, Hardie&#x27;s energy and activity shone and he accepted a call from Ayrshire to relocate there to organise the local miners. The young couple moved to the town of Cumnock, where Keir set to work organising a union of local miners, a process which occupied nearly a year.
In August 1881, Ayrshire miners put forward the demand for a 10 per cent increase in wages, a proposition summarily refused by the region&#x27;s mine owners. Despite the lack of funds for strike pay, a stoppage was called and a 10-week shutdown of the region&#x27;s mines ensued. This strike also was formally a failure, with miners returning to work before their demands had been met, but not long after the return wages were escalated across the board by the mine owners, fearful of future labour actions. One of the other leaders of the strike was 19-year-old miner Andrew Fisher, who decades later would become leader of the Australian Labor Party and Prime Minister of Australia. He and Hardie met regularly to discuss politics when they both lived in Ayrshire and would renew their acquaintance on several occasions later in life.

To make ends meet, Hardie turned to journalism, starting to write for the local newspaper, the &quot;Cumnock News,&quot; a paper loyal to the pro-labour Liberal Party, after which, Hardie joined the Liberal Association, in which he was active. He also continued his temperance work as an active member of the local Good Templar&#x27;s Lodge.

In August 1886, Hardie&#x27;s ongoing efforts to build a powerful union of Scottish miners were rewarded when there was formed the Ayrshire Miners Union. Hardie was named Organising Secretary of the new union, drawing a salary of £75 per year.

In 1887, Hardie launched a new publication called &quot;The Miner&quot;.

==Scottish Labour Party==
Hardie was a dedicated Georgist for a number of years and a member of the Scottish Land Restoration League. It was &quot;through the single tax&quot; on land monopoly that Hardie gradually became a Fabian socialist. He reasoned that &quot;whatever the idea may be, State socialism is necessary as a stage in the development of the ideal.&quot; Despite his early support of the Liberal Party, Hardie became disillusioned by William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s economic policies and began to feel that the Liberals would not advocate the interests of the working class. Hardie concluded that the Liberal Party wanted the worker&#x27;s votes without in return the radical reform he believed to be crucial – he stood for Parliament.

In April 1888, Hardie was an Independent Labour candidate at the Mid Lanarkshire by-election. He finished last but he was not deterred by this, and believed he would enjoy more success in the future. At a public meeting in Glasgow on 25 August 1888 the Scottish Labour Party (a different party from the 1994-created Scottish Labour Party) was founded, with Hardie becoming the party&#x27;s first secretary. The party&#x27;s president was Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, the first socialist MP, and later founder of the National Party of Scotland, forerunner to the Scottish National Party.

==MP for West Ham South==
Hardie was invited to stand in West Ham South in 1892, a working-class seat in Essex (now Greater London). The Liberals decided not to field a candidate, but at the same time not to offer Hardie any assistance. Competing against the Conservative Party candidate, Hardie won by 5,268 votes to 4,036. He was variously described as the Labour or &quot;Liberal and Labour&quot; candidate. 

Upon taking his seat on 3 August 1892, Hardie refused to wear the &quot;parliamentary uniform&quot; of black frock coat, black silk top hat and starched wing collar that other working-class MPs wore. Instead, Hardie wore a plain tweed suit, a red tie and a deerstalker hat. Although the deerstalker was the correct and matching apparel for his suit, he was nevertheless lambasted in the press, and was accused of wearing a flat cap, headgear associated with the common working man; a &quot;cloth cap in Parliament&quot;. 

In Parliament, Hardie advocated a graduated income tax, free schooling, pensions, the abolition of the House of Lords and for women&#x27;s right to vote.

==Independent Labour Party==

In 1893, Hardie and others formed the Independent Labour Party, an action that worried the Liberals, who were afraid that the ILP might, at some point in the future, win the working-class votes that they traditionally received.

Hardie hit the headlines in 1894, when after an explosion at the Albion colliery in Cilfynydd near Pontypridd which killed 251 miners, he asked that a message of condolence to the relatives of the victims be added to an address of congratulations on the birth of a royal heir (the future Edward VIII). The request was refused and Hardie made a speech in the House of Commons attacking the monarchy, which almost predicted the nature of the future king&#x27;s marriage that led to his abdication.
This speech was highly controversial and contributed to the loss of his seat in 1895.

==Labour Party==

Hardie spent the next five years of his life building up the Labour movement and speaking at various public meetings; he was arrested at a woman&#x27;s suffrage meeting in London, but the Home Secretary, concerned about arresting the leader of the ILP, ordered his release.

In 1900 Hardie organised a meeting of various trade unions and socialist groups; they agreed to form a Labour Representation Committee and so the Labour Party was born. Later that same year Hardie, representing Labour, was elected as the junior MP for the dual-member constituency of Merthyr Tydfil in the South Wales Valleys, which he would represent for the remainder of his life. Only one other Labour MP was elected that year (Richard Bell for Derby), but from these small beginnings the party continued to grow, forming the first-ever Labour government in 1924.

Meanwhile, the Conservative and Liberal Unionist coalition government became deeply unpopular, and Liberal leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman was worried about possible vote-splitting across the Labour and Liberal parties in the next election. A deal was struck in 1903, which became known as the Lib-Lab pact of 1903 or Gladstone-MacDonald pact. It was engineered by Ramsay MacDonald and Liberal Chief Whip Herbert Gladstone: the Liberals would not stand against Labour in thirty constituencies in the next election, in order to avoid splitting the anti-Conservative vote.
In 1905 Hardie served as an LRC election agent for William Walker who came close to victory with 48.5% of the vote in Belfast North. Despite his own support for Irish home rule, Hardie, who made repeated visits, appeared determined to treat Belfast as a &quot;typical British city&quot;, confident that class politics could surmount sectarian division over the constitutional question.

In 1906, the LRC changed its name to the &quot;Labour Party&quot;. That year, the newly established Liberal government of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman called a General Election — resulting in a heavy defeat for the Conservative Party (then in opposition), and the landslide affirmation of the Liberals.

The 1906 general election result was one of the biggest landslide victories in British history: the Liberals swept the Conservatives (and their Liberal Unionist allies) out of what were regarded as safe seats. Conservative leader and former Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour, lost his seat, Manchester East, on a swing of over 20 per cent. What would later turn out to be even more significant was the election of 29 Labour MPs.

In January 1907 at the Labour Party&#x27;s first annual conference, held in Belfast, Hardie helped raise the issue of whether sovereignty lay with the annual conference, as in the inherited tradition of trade union democracy, or with the PLP. In the closing session he shocked the delegates by threatening to resign from the PLP over an amendment to a resolution on equal suffrage for women that would have bound him as an MP to oppose any compromise legislation that would extend votes to women on the basis of the existing property franchise. This, he saw, as potentially delaying the extension of &quot;citizenship&quot; to women on which he spoke passionately:I thought the days of my pioneering were over but of late I have felt, with increasing intensity, the injustice inflicted on women by our present laws. The Party is largely my own child and I cannot part from it lightly, or without pain; but at the same time I cannot sever myself from the principles I hold. If it is necessary for me to separate myself from what has been my life&#x27;s work, I do so in order to remove the stigma resting upon our wives, mothers and sisters of being accounted unfit for citizenship.
The PLP defused the crisis by allowing Hardie to vote as he wished on the subject. The precedent became the basis of a &quot;conscience clause&quot; in its standing orders, and would be invoked by party leader Michael Foot in 1981 to argue that the will of the conference should not always bind the PLP.

Hardie, never good at dealing with internal dissension, did resign his chairmanship of the party the following year, 1908. He was replaced by Arthur Henderson.

Hardie in his evidence to the 1899 House of Commons Select Committee on emigration and immigration, argued that the Scots resented immigrants greatly and that they would want a total immigration ban. When it was pointed out to him that more people left Scotland than entered it, he replied, &quot;It would be much better for Scotland if those 1,500 were compelled to remain there and let the foreigners be kept out... Dr Johnson said God made Scotland for Scotchmen, and I would keep it so.&quot; According to Hardie, the Lithuanian migrant workers in the mining industry had &quot;filthy habits&quot;, they lived off &quot;garlic and oil&quot;, and they were carriers of &quot;the Black Death&quot;. 

In 1908, when visiting South Africa, he said the Socialist movement stood for equal rights for every race but that &quot;we do not say all races are equal; no one dreams of doing that&quot;. On return to the UK he stated his belief that black people should be given the opportunity to vote and to take a full part in society.

==Later career==
After resigning the leadership of the party in 1908, Hardie devoted himself to campaigning for votes for women and developing a closer relationship with Sylvia Pankhurst. His secretary Margaret Symons Travers was the first woman to speak in the House of Commons when she tricked her way in on 13 October 1908.

He also campaigned for self-rule for India and an end to segregation in South Africa.During a visit to the United States in 1909, his criticism of sectarianism among American radicals caused intensified debate regarding the American Socialist Party possibly joining with the unions in a labour party.

A pacifist, Hardie was appalled by the First World War and along with socialists in other countries he tried to organise an international general strike to stop the war. His stance was not popular, even within the Labour Party, but he continued to address anti-war demonstrations across the country and to support conscientious objectors. After the outbreak of war, on 4 August 1914, Hardie&#x27;s spirited anti-war speeches often received opposition in the form of loud heckling. Hardie was among many Scottish socialists, the likes of John MacLean and Willie Gallacher, who opposed the War and believed that working-class men fighting other working-class men only served the interests of capitalism. 

Despite this, once the war had started Hardie seems to have resigned himself to the inevitability of pursuing it rather than stopping it immediately. In a full-page article in the &quot;Merthyr Pioneer&quot; on 28 November 1914, he wrote:

In the same article he also opposed accusations that he was unpatriotic by claiming that his meetings encouraged young men to enlist while those of his Liberal opponents did the opposite:

After a series of strokes, Hardie died in a hospital in Glasgow of pneumonia at noon on 26 September 1915, aged 59. His friend and fellow pacifist Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais) delivered the sermon at Hardie&#x27;s memorial service at Aberdare, in his constituency.
He was cremated in Maryhill, Glasgow. A memorial stone in his honour is at Cumnock Cemetery Cumnock, Ayrshire, Scotland.

==Legacy==
On 2 December 2006, a memorial bust of Hardie was unveiled by Cynon Valley MP Ann Clwyd outside council offices in Aberdare (in his former constituency). The ceremony marked a centenary since the party&#x27;s birth.

Hardie is still held in high esteem in his old home town of Holytown, where his childhood home is preserved for people to view, while the local sports centre was named in his own honour as &quot;The Keir Hardie Sports Centre&quot;. Keir Hardie Memorial Primary School opened in 1956, named for him. There are now 40 streets throughout Britain named after Hardie. Alan Morrison has, in turn, used the title &quot;Keir Hardie Street&quot; for his 2010 narrative long poem in which a fictitious, turn-of-the-century, working-class poet discovers a socialist utopia off the dreamt-up Sea-Green Line of the London Underground.

One of the buildings at Swansea University is also named after him, while a main distributor road in Sunderland is named the Keir Hardie Way.

The Ellen Wilkinson Estate in Wardley, East Gateshead (once in the Urban District of Felling, subsumed by Gateshead Metropolitan Borough in 1974) has Keir Hardie Avenue as its main street. Every other street is named after a pre-1960 Labour MP. The England footballer, Chris Waddle, lived in Number 1 Keir Hardie Avenue, Gateshead, between 1971 and 1983.

The Keir Hardie Estate in Canning Town (Newham, East London) is named after him as a legacy to his tenure as MP for West Ham South, Newham. Keir Hardie Avenue in the town of Cleator Moor, Cumbria, has been named after him since 1934 Furthermore, an estate in the London Borough of Brent was also named after Hardie. Keir Hardie Crescent in Kilwinning in Scotland is named after him, as is a block of apartments in Little Thurrock. There is also a Keir Hardie Street in Greenock and a Keir Hardie Street in Methil, Fife, a predominantly Labour stronghold.
There is also a Hardie Street in West Dunbartonshire, amongst a range of streets named after famous socialist leaders or thinkers and Labour figures.

Ty Keir Hardie, in his constituency town of Merthyr Tydfil, housed offices for Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council and adjoins the Civic Centre on Castle Street. In Merthyr Tydfil, there is also a Keir Hardie Estate with streets named after prominent early Independent Labour leaders such as Wallhead and Glasier.

In recognition of his work as a lay preacher, the Keir Hardie Methodist Church in Newham, London bears his name.

There is a Kier Hardie Terrace in Dunfermline, Fife named after him as he helped the mining campaign for local mining families.

Labour founder Hardie has been voted the party&#x27;s &quot;greatest hero&quot; in a straw poll of delegates at the 2008 Labour conference in Manchester. Labour peer Lord Morgan, Ed Balls, David Blunkett and Fiona Mactaggart argued the case for four Labour figures at a &quot;Guardian&quot; fringe meeting at the Labour conference 2008 in Manchester, 23 September 2008.

Hardie&#x27;s younger half-brothers David Hardie, George Hardie and sister-in-law Agnes Hardie all became Labour Party Members of Parliament after his death. His daughter Nan Hardie and her husband Emrys Hughes both became Provost of Cumnock; Hughes also became Labour Member of Parliament for South Ayrshire in 1946.

Biographer Kenneth O. Morgan has sketched Hardie&#x27;s personality:
Keir Starmer, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Labour Party, who serves as MP in the House of Commons for Holborn and St Pancras, was reportedly named after Hardie, though Starmer said in 2015 that he did not know whether this is true. Keir Mather, Labour MP for Selby and Ainsty, is also named after Hardie.

===Keir Hardie Society===
On 15 August 2010 (the 154th anniversary of Hardie&#x27;s birth) the Keir Hardie Society was founded at Summerlee, Museum of Scottish Industrial Life. The society aims to &quot;keep alive the ideas and promote the life and work of Keir Hardie&quot;. Among the co-founders was Cathy Jamieson, who at the time was the MSP for the constituency of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, which covers the area where Hardie lived most of his life. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard was the main founder of the society, along with Hugh Gaffney MP.

===In other media===
In August 2016, Jim Kenworth&#x27;s play &quot;A Splotch of Red: Keir Hardie in West Ham&quot; was premiered at various venues in Newham, including Neighbours Hall in Canning Town at which Hardie spoke. The play deals with Hardie&#x27;s battle to win the constituency of West Ham South. It was directed by James Martin Charlton; Samuel Caseley played Keir Hardie.

Hardie appears as a character in Howard Spring&#x27;s 1940 novel, Fame Is the Spur, in which he gives advice and support to the main protaganists in the early days of the labour movement.

<text>Mae Hong Son province (Burmese: မဲဟောင်ဆောင်; , ; Northern Thai: ; Shan: ; formerly called &quot;Mae Rong Son&quot;), also spelled &quot;Maehongson&quot;, &quot;Mae Hong Sorn&quot; or &quot;Maehongsorn&quot;, is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;). It lies in upper northern Thailand and is the westernmost province. Neighboring provinces are (clockwise from north) Shan State of Myanmar, Chiang Mai and Tak. To the west, the province borders Kayin State and Kayah State of Myanmar.

Mae Hong Son&#x27;s nickname is &quot;the city of three mists&quot;. It is hemmed in by the high mountain ranges of the Shan Hills and is the most mountainous province in Thailand, occupying . The province is often covered with mist. Mae Hong Son town was originally established in the early 19th century as an elephant training camp as ordered by the then King of Chiang Mai.
, Mae Hong Son was the poorest province in Thailand.

==History==
Mae Hong Son province was formerly part of Mawkmai State, one of the Shan States which had been founded in 1767 by Hsai Khiao, from a noble family of Chiang Mai.

As a result of the Anglo-Siamese Boundary Commission of 1892–1893, Mae Hong Son District was ceded to Siam, but the adjacent Möngmaü and Mehsakun trans-Salween Districts also claimed by Siam (as territories on the eastern side of the Salween River), were kept as part of British Burma.

==Environment==
The Thai government, to solve persistent water shortages in the central region, have proposed a 70.7 billion baht plan to divert some 1.8 billion m3 of water annually from the Yuam River to the perennially underfilled Bhumibol Dam. Several of the province&#x27;s districts would impacted. As part of the plan, the Royal Irrigation Department (RID), would build 69 metre high dam with a storage capacity of 68.7 million m3 constructed on 2,075 rai of forest land, together with a pumping station on a separate 55 rai plot and a 61.5 kilometre-long tunnel passing through 14 villages. The inhabitants of the area—primarily Karen tribes people—largely oppose the project. In December 2019, the RID submitted a second environmental impact assessment (EIA) to the Office of the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP). ONEP rejected the EIA for the second time due to concerns about forest destruction, tunnel rock waste, and compensation issues.

==Demographics==
===Ethnic diversity===
Shan people is the largest population group in the province. They migrated from Shan State in Myanmar. Further there are seven hill tribes which consists of 63% of the provincial population: Karen, Lahu, Lisu, Lua, Miao, Chinese Yunnan and Pa-O people.

The Karen are not a single group, but rather a mix of closely related tribes. Among the smallest of the Karen tribes in Thailand are Kayan Lahwi. This group&#x27;s women are recognized by the large brass rings they wear around their necks. Population density is 22 persons per km2, the lowest of all provinces.

===Language===
* Tai Yai people speak their own language. The written language with round alphabets is like Mon and Burmese script. 
* Karen and Chinese Haw have their own spoken and written language.

<doc id="236466" wikidata="Q161341" url="?curid=236466" title="Airborne early warning and control">
<text>An airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) system is an airborne radar early warning system designed to detect aircraft, ships, vehicles, missiles and other incoming projectiles at long ranges, as well as performing command and control of the battlespace in aerial engagements by informing and directing friendly fighter and attack aircraft. AEW&amp;C units are also used to carry out aerial surveillance over ground and maritime targets, and frequently perform battle management command and control (BMC2). When used at altitude, the radar system on AEW&amp;C aircraft allows the operators to detect, track and prioritize targets and identify friendly aircraft from hostile ones in real-time and from much farther away than ground-based radars. Like ground-based radars, AEW&amp;C systems can be detected and targeted by opposing forces, but due to aircraft mobility and extended sensor range, they are much less vulnerable to counter-attacks than ground systems.

AEW&amp;C aircraft are used for both defensive and offensive air operations, and serve air forces in the same role as what the combat information center is to naval warships, in addition to being a highly mobile and powerful radar platform. So useful and advantageous is it to have such aircraft operating at a high altitude, that some navies also operate AEW&amp;C aircraft for their warships at sea, either coastal- or carrier-based and on both fixed-wing and rotary-wing platforms. In the case of the United States Navy, the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye AEW&amp;C aircraft is assigned to its supercarriers to protect them and augment their onboard command information centers (CICs). The designation &quot;airborne early warning&quot; (AEW) was used for earlier similar aircraft used in the less-demanding radar picket role, such as the Fairey Gannet AEW.3 and Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, and continues to be used by the RAF for its Sentry AEW1, while AEW&amp;C (airborne early warning and control) emphasizes the command and control capabilities that may not be present on smaller or simpler radar picket aircraft. AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) is the name of the specific system installed in the E-3 and Japanese Boeing E-767 AEW&amp;C airframes, but is often used as a general synonym for AEW&amp;C.

==General characteristics==
Modern AEW&amp;C systems can detect aircraft from up to away, well out of range of most surface-to-air missiles. One AEW&amp;C aircraft flying at can cover an area of . Three such aircraft in overlapping orbits can cover the whole of Central Europe. AEW&amp;C system indicates close and far proximity range on threats and targets, help extend the range of their sensors, and make offensive aircraft harder to track by avoiding the need for them to keep their own radar active, which the enemy can detect. Systems also communicate with friendly aircraft, vectoring fighters towards hostile aircraft or any unidentified flying object.

==History of development==
After having developed Chain Home—the first ground-based early-warning radar detection system—in the 1930s, the British developed a radar set that could be carried on an aircraft for what they termed &quot;Air Controlled Interception&quot;. The intention was to cover the North West approaches where German long range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor aircraft were threatening shipping. A Vickers Wellington bomber (serial R1629) was fitted with a rotating antenna array. It was tested for use against aerial targets and then for possible use against German E boats. Another radar equipped Wellington with a different installation was used to direct Bristol Beaufighters toward Heinkel He 111s, which were air-launching V-1 flying bombs.

In February 1944, the US Navy ordered the development of a radar system that could be carried aloft in an aircraft under Project Cadillac. A prototype system was built and flown in August on a modified TBM Avenger torpedo bomber. Tests were successful, with the system being able to detect low flying formations at a range greater than . US Navy then ordered production of the TBM-3W, the first production AEW aircraft to enter service. TBM-3Ws fitted with the AN/APS-20 radar entered service in March 1945, with 27 eventually constructed. It was also recognised that a larger land-based aircraft would be attractive, thus, under the &quot;Cadillac II&quot; program, multiple Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress bombers were also outfitted with the same radar.

The Lockheed WV and EC-121 Warning Star, which first flew in 1949, served widely with US Air Force and US Navy. It provided the main AEW coverage for US forces during the Vietnam war. It remained operational until replaced with the E-3 AWACS. Developed roughly in parallel, N-class blimps were also used as AEW aircraft, filling gaps in radar coverage for the continental US, their tremendous endurance of over 200 hours being a major asset in an AEW aircraft. Following a crash, the US Navy opted to discontinue lighter than air operations in 1962.

In 1958, the Soviet Tupolev Design Bureau was ordered to design an AEW aircraft. After determining that the projected radar instrumentation would not fit in a Tupolev Tu-95 or a Tupolev Tu-116, the decision was made to use the more capacious Tupolev Tu-114 instead. This solved the problems with cooling and operator space that existed with the narrower Tu-95 and Tu-116 fuselage. To meet range requirements, production examples were fitted with an air-to-air refueling probe. The resulting system, the Tupolev Tu-126, entered service in 1965 with the Soviet Air Forces and remained in service until replaced by the Beriev A-50 in 1984.

During the Cold war, United Kingdom deployed a substantial AEW capability, initially with American Douglas AD-4W Skyraiders, designated Skyraider AEW.1, which in turn were replaced by the Fairey Gannet AEW.3, using the same AN/APS-20 radar. With the retirement of conventional aircraft carriers, the Gannet was withdrawn and the Royal Air Force (RAF) installed the radars from the Gannets on Avro Shackleton MR.2 airframes, redesignated Shackleton AEW.2. To replace the Shackleton AEW.2, an AEW variant of the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, known as the Nimrod AEW3, was ordered in 1974. After a protracted and problematic development, this was cancelled in 1986, and seven E-3Ds, designated Sentry AEW.1 in RAF service, were purchased instead.

==Current systems==

Many countries have developed their own AEW&amp;C systems, although the Boeing E-3 Sentry, E-7A and Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye and Gulfstream/IAI EL/W-2085 are the most common systems worldwide.

===Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)===
Boeing produces a specific system with a &quot;rotodome&quot; rotating radome that incorporates Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) radar. It is mounted on either the E-3 Sentry aircraft (Boeing 707) or more recently the Boeing E-767 (Boeing 767), the latter only being used by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.

When AWACS first entered service it represented a major advance in capability, being the first AEW to use a pulse-Doppler radar, which allowed it to track targets normally lost in ground clutter. Previously, low-flying aircraft could only be readily tracked over water. The AWACS features a three-dimensional radar that measures azimuth, range, and elevation simultaneously; the AN/APY-2 unit installed upon the E-767 and later E-3 models has superior surveillance capability over water compared to the AN/APY-1 system on the earlier E-3 models.

===E-2 Hawkeye===
The E-2 Hawkeye was a specially designed AEW aircraft. Upon its entry to service in 1965, it was initially plagued by technical issues, causing a (later reversed) cancellation. Procurement resumed after efforts to improve reliability, such as replacement of the original rotary drum computer used for processing radar information by a Litton L-304 digital computer. In addition to purchases by the US Navy, the E-2 Hawkeye has been sold to the armed forces of Egypt, France, Israel, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan.

The latest E-2 version is the &quot;E-2D Advanced Hawkeye&quot;, which features the new AN/APY-9 radar. The APY-9 radar has been speculated to be capable of detecting fighter-sized stealth aircraft, which are typically optimized against high frequencies like Ka, Ku, X, C and parts of the S-bands. Historically, UHF radars had resolution and detection issues that made them ineffective for accurate targeting and fire control; Northrop Grumman and Lockheed claim that the APY-9 has solved these shortcomings in the APY-9 using advanced electronic scanning and high digital computing power via space/time adaptive processing.

===Beriev A-50===
The Russian Aerospace Forces are currently using approximately 3-5 Beriev A-50 and A-50U &quot;Shmel&quot; in the AEW role. The &quot;Mainstay&quot; is based on the Ilyushin Il-76 airframe, with a large non-rotating disk radome on the rear fuselage. These replaced the 12 Tupolev Tu-126 that filled the role previously. The A-50 and A-50U will eventually be replaced by the Beriev A-100, which features an AESA array in the radome and is based on the updated Il-476.

===KJ-2000===
In May 1997, Russia and Israel agreed to jointly fulfill an order from China to develop and deliver an early warning system. China reportedly ordered one Phalcon for $250 million, which entailed retrofitting a Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo plane [also incorrectly reported as a Beriev A-50 Mainstay] with advanced Elta electronic, computer, radar and communications systems. Beijing was expected to acquire several Phalcon AEW systems, and reportedly could buy at least three more [and possibly up to eight] of these systems, the prototype of which was planned for testing beginning in 2000. In July 2000, the US pressured Israel to back out of the $1 billion agreement to sell China four Phalcon phased-array radar systems. Following the cancelled A-50I/Phalcon deal, China turned to indigenous solutions. The Phalcon radar and other electronic systems were taken off from the unfinished Il-76, and the airframe was handed to China via Russia in 2002. The Chinese AWACS has a unique phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage. The installation of equipment at the Il-76 began in late 2002 aircraft by Xian aircraft industries (Xian Aircraft Industry Co.). The first flight of an airplane KJ-2000 made in November 2003. All four machines will be equipped with this type. The last to be introduced into service the Chinese Air Force until the end of 2007. China is also developing a carrier-based AEW&amp;C, Xian KJ-600 via Y-7 derived Xian JZY-01 testbed.

===EL/W-2085 AEW&amp;C===
The EL/W-2085 is an airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) multi-band radar system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and its subsidiary Elta Systems of Israel. Its primary objective is to provide intelligence to maintain air superiority and conduct surveillance. The system is currently in service with Israel, Italy, and Singapore.
Instead of using a rotodome, a moving radar was found on some AEW&amp;C aircraft, and the EL/W-2085 used an active electronically scanned array (AESA) – an active phased array radar. This radar consists of an array of transmit/receive (T/R) modules that allow a beam to be electronically steered, making a physically rotating rotodome unnecessary.

AESA radars operate on a pseudorandom set of frequencies and also have very short scanning rates, which makes them difficult to detect and jam. Up to 1000 targets can be tracked simultaneously to a range of 243 mi (450 km), while at the same time, multitudes of air-to-air interceptions or air-to-surface (including maritime) attacks can be guided simultaneously. The radar equipment of the Israeli AEW&amp;C consists of each L-band radar on the left and right sides of the fuselage and each S-band antenna in the nose and tail. The phased array allows aircraft positions on operator screens to be updated every 2–4 seconds rather than every 10 seconds, as is the case on the rotodome AWACS.

ELTA was the first company to introduce an Active Electronically Scanned Array Airborne (AESA) Early Warning Aircraft and implement advanced mission aircraft using efficient, high-performance business jet platforms. 

===Netra AEW&amp;CS===
In 2003, the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) began a study of requirements for developing an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWAC) system. In 2015, DRDO delivered 3 AWACs, called Netra, to the IAF with an advanced Indian AESA radar system fitted on the Brazilian Embraer EMB-145 air frame. Netra gives a 240-degree coverage of airspace. The Emb-145 also has air-to-air refuelling capability for longer surveillance time. The IAF also operates three Israeli EL/W-2090 systems, mounted on Ilyushin Il-76 airframes, the first of which first arrived on 25 May 2009. The DRDO proposed a more advanced AWACS with a longer range and with a 360-degree coverage akin to the Phalcon system, based on the Airbus A330 airframe, but given the costs involved there is also the possibility of converting used A320 airliners as well.

IAF has plans to develop 6 more Netra AEW&amp;CS based on Embraer EMB-145 platform and another 6 based on Airbus A321 platform. These systems are expected to have an enhanced performance including range and azimuth
===Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C===

The Royal Australian Air Force, Republic of Korea Air Force and the Turkish Air Force are deploying Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C aircraft. The Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C has a fixed, active electronically scanned array radar antenna instead of a mechanically-rotating one, and is capable of simultaneous air and sea search, fighter control and area search, with a maximum range of over 600 km (look-up mode). In addition, the radar antenna array is also doubled as an ELINT array, with a maximum range of over 850 km at altitude.
===Erieye/GlobalEye===

The Swedish Air Force uses the S 100D Argus ASC890 as its AEW platform. The S 100D Argus is based on the Saab 340 with an Ericsson Erieye PS-890 radar. Saab also offers the Bombardier Global 6000-based GlobalEye. In early 2006, the Pakistan Air Force ordered six Erieye AEW equipped Saab 2000s from Sweden. In December 2006, the Pakistan Navy requested three excess P-3 Orion aircraft to be equipped with Hawkeye 2000 AEW systems. China and Pakistan also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the joint development of AEW&amp;C systems.

The Hellenic Air Force, Brazilian Air Force and Mexican Air Force use the Embraer R-99 with an Ericsson Erieye PS-890 radar, as on the S 100D.

===Others===
Israel has developed the IAI/Elta EL/M-2075 Phalcon system, which uses an AESA (active electronically scanned array) in lieu of a rotodome antenna. The system was the first such system to enter service. The original Phalcon was mounted on a Boeing 707 and developed for the Israeli Defense Force and for export. Israel uses IAI EL/W-2085 airborne early warning and control multi-band radar system on Gulfstream G550; this platform is considered to be both more capable and less expensive to operate than the older Boeing 707-based Phalcon fleet.

==Helicopter AEW systems==
On 3 June 1957, the first of 2 HR2S-1W, a derivative of the Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave, was delivered to the US Navy, it used the AN/APS-32 but proved unreliable due to vibration.

The British Sea King ASaC7 naval helicopter was operated from both the s and later the helicopter carrier . The creation of Sea King ASaC7, and earlier AEW.2 and AEW.5 models, came as the consequence of lessons learnt by the Royal Navy during the 1982 Falklands War when the lack of AEW coverage for the task force was a major tactical handicap, and rendered them vulnerable to low-level attack. The Sea King was determined to be both more practical and responsive than the proposed alternative of relying on the RAF&#x27;s land-based Shackleton AEW.2 fleet. The first examples were a pair of Sea King HAS2s that had the Thorn-EMI ARI 5980/3 Searchwater LAST radar attached to the fuselage on a swivel arm and protected by an inflatable dome. The improved Sea King ASaC7 featured the Searchwater 2000AEW radar, which was capable of simultaneously tracking up to 400 targets, instead of an earlier limit of 250 targets. The Spanish Navy fields the SH-3 Sea King in the same role, operated from the LPH . 

The AgustaWestland EH-101A AEW of the Italian Navy is operated from the aircraft carriers and . During the 2010s, the Royal Navy opted to replace its Sea Kings with a modular &quot;Crowsnest&quot; system that can be fitted to any of their Merlin HM2 fleet. The Crowsnest system was partially based upon the Sea King ASaC7&#x27;s equipment; an unsuccessful bid by Lockheed Martin had proposed using a new multi-functional sensor for either the AW101 or another aircraft.

The Russian-built Kamov Ka-31 is deployed by the Indian Navy on the aircraft carriers and and also on s. The Russian Navy has two Ka-31R variants, at least one of which was deployed on their aircraft carrier in 2016. It is fitted with E-801M Oko (Eye) airborne electronic warfare radar that can track 20 targets simultaneously, detecting aircraft up to away, and surface warships up to distant.

<text>A run batted in or runs batted in (RBI) is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored (except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play). For example, if the batter bats a base hit which allows a teammate on a higher base to reach home and so score a run, then the batter gets credited with an RBI.

Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season, runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic. Nevertheless, the RBI statistic was tabulated—unofficially—from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan, according to the Society for American Baseball Research.

Common nicknames for an RBI include &quot;ribby&quot; (or &quot;ribbie&quot;), &quot;rib&quot;, and &quot;ribeye&quot;. The plural of &quot;RBI&quot; is a matter of &quot;(very) minor controversy&quot; for baseball fans: it is usually &quot;RBIs&quot;, in accordance with the usual practice for pluralizing initialisms in English; however, some sources use &quot;RBI&quot; as the plural, on the basis that it can stand for &quot;runs batted in&quot;.

==Major League Baseball rules==
The 2018 edition of the Official Baseball Rules of Major League Baseball (MLB), Rule 9.04 Runs Batted In, reads:
From 1980 to 1988, the game-winning RBI was an additional statistic used in MLB.

==Criticism==
The perceived significance of the RBI is displayed by the fact that it is one of the three categories that compose the triple crown. In addition, career RBIs are often cited in debates over who should be elected to the Hall of Fame. However, critics, particularly within the field of sabermetrics, argue that RBIs measure the quality of the lineup more than it does the player himself. This is because an RBI can only be credited to a player if one or more batters preceding him in the batting order have reached base (the exception to this being a home run, in which the batter is credited with driving himself in, not just those already on base). This implies that better offensive teams —and therefore, the teams in which the most players get on base— tend to produce hitters with higher RBI totals than equivalent hitters on lesser-hitting teams.

<doc id="236470" wikidata="Q697388" url="?curid=236470" title="Tru Calling">
<text>Tru Calling is an American supernatural drama television series which aired on Fox. Original episodes aired between October 30, 2003, and April 21, 2005; however, the final episode was shown in other territories before it was aired in the United States due to lower-than-anticipated ratings.

The show starred Eliza Dushku as Tru Davies, a twenty-two-year-old medical school student who takes a job at the city morgue when her internship falls through. When the corpse of a deceased woman seems to awaken and asks for her help, Tru discovers that she has the incredible power to relive that day in order to try to prevent that death. Over the course of the series, Tru struggles to keep her secret, juggle her responsibilities with her complicated personal life, and learn to control her power.

Created by Jon Harmon Feldman, the show was produced by Original Film, Oh That Gus!, Inc., and 20th Century Fox Television.

== Series overview ==

Tru is aided by her boss, Davis (Zach Galifianakis), who acts as a sort of guide and mentor, who is later revealed to have known about Tru&#x27;s mother (who was, apparently, the last person to receive the &quot;calling&quot; before her daughter), her best friend Lindsey (A.J. Cook), who doesn&#x27;t know Tru&#x27;s secret, and her impulsive, good-natured and bumbling younger brother Harrison (Shawn Reaves). Tru keeps her secret from her boyfriends, as well as her sister Meredith (Jessica Collins), who has a drug problem.

Halfway through the first season, Tru&#x27;s life gets much more complicated when she meets Jack Harper (Jason Priestley), a man who shares Tru&#x27;s abilities but who works to preserve what he sees as the hand of Fate by ensuring that the people Tru tries to help stay dead, though the series was canceled before the conclusion of their struggle was written. In the first-season finale, it is revealed that Tru&#x27;s father knows Jack Harper and that he had played a similarly antagonistic role versus Tru&#x27;s mother, terminating her by hiring a hitman to kill her, though neither Harrison nor Tru found out.

The second season does not feature Tru&#x27;s best friend Lindsey nor her sister Meredith, whose characters are not mentioned. This season has Tru juggling medical school and her live-saving ability, while Jack aims to foil her attempts at every turn.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (2003–04)===
===Season 2 (2005)===
== Cancellation ==
The series was canceled in 2005 due to low ratings. The final episode aired in many other territories before it screened in the US. The cancellation ended the series with multiple unresolved cliffhangers:
*Tru&#x27;s season two romantic interest, a fellow medical student named Jensen, begins to remember moments of him and Tru together from the negated timeline where he was killed, causing him to obsess over death.
*Although initially highly antagonistic to Jack, Tru invites him to her Christmas get-together, hinting that he may in time become an ally against her father, Richard.
*Dr. Carrie Allen, the new psychologist at the morgue, who&#x27;d been revealed in earlier episodes as an agent of Jack&#x27;s working to seduce and subvert Davis, is told the truth about Tru&#x27;s power to rewind by Davis; Davis has yet to inform Tru.
*Jack, talking to Tru&#x27;s father at her party, hints that he is still intent on making sure Jensen dies, despite having failed to seal his fated death in the previous episode.

=== Russian adaptation ===
The series has been adapted in Russia using the title Я отменяю смерть, pronounced as &quot;Ja otmenjaju smertj&#x27;&quot;, and translated to &quot;I Revoke the Death&quot;, premiering in the country on TV-3 on October 9, 2012.

== Broadcast ==
The series completed airing in its entirety in New Zealand first. The second season began airing in the country on TV3 on February 4, 2005, with the final episode shown on March 11, 2005. After nearly a year-long hiatus in the U.S., new episodes began on Fox on March 31, 2005. However, the series was pulled again in favour of Fox&#x27;s new show &quot;Point Pleasant&quot; and the final episode was screened in many other territories before it finally aired in the U.S. on January 21, 2008 on Syfy.

The complete series also aired in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Portugal, South Africa, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.

It was first aired in Spain in 2005 in the FOX cable channel. In summer 2006 Tru Calling made its public debut in Antena 3 and was later moved to its secondary channel, Neox, where the show had several reruns during the following years.

<doc id="236473" wikidata="Q452765" url="?curid=236473" title="Jim Garrison">
<text>James Carothers Garrison (born Earling Carothers Garrison; November 20, 1921 – October 21, 1992) was the District Attorney of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, from 1962 to 1973 and later a state appellate court judge. A member of the Democratic Party, he is best known for his investigations into the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the prosecution of New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw to that effect in 1969, which ended in Shaw&#x27;s acquittal. He wrote three published books, one of which became a prime source for Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;JFK&quot; in 1991, in which Garrison was portrayed by Kevin Costner, while Garrison himself made a cameo appearance as Earl Warren.

== Early life and career ==
Garrison was born in Denison, Iowa, in 1921. He was the first child and only son of Earling R. Garrison and Jane Anne Robinson who divorced when he was two years old. His family moved to New Orleans quite early into his childhood, where he was raised by his divorced mother. He served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, having joined the year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. After the war he obtained a law degree from Tulane University Law School in 1949. He then worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for two years where he was stationed with the Seattle office.

Leading up to the Korean War era, Garrison joined the National Guard, even applying for active duty with the Army in 1951, but because of recurring nightmares of past missions Garrison was then relieved of duty by the Army. Remaining in the Guard, when it became apparent that he suffered from shell shock due to his numerous bombing missions flown during World War II, led one Army doctor to conclude that Garrison had a &quot;severe and disabling psychoneurosis&quot; which &quot;interfered with his social and professional adjustment to a marked degree. He was considered totally incapacitated from the standpoint of military duty and moderately incapacitated in civilian adaptability.&quot; Yet, when his record was reviewed further by the U.S. Army Surgeon General, he &quot;found him to be physically qualified for federal recognition in the national army.&quot; Upon returning again to civilian life, Garrison worked in several different trial lawyer positions before winning election as New Orleans District Attorney, starting with his first of three terms in January 1962.

== District attorney ==
In the years prior to winning office as New Orleans District Attorney in 1961, Garrison worked for the New Orleans law firm of Deutsch, Kerrigan &amp; Stiles from 1954 to 1958, before he first became an assistant district attorney. Garrison became a flamboyant, colorful, well-known figure in New Orleans, but was initially unsuccessful in his run for public office. He lost a 1959 election for criminal court judge. In 1961, he ran for district attorney and won against incumbent Richard Dowling by 6,000 votes in a five-man Democratic primary. Despite lack of major political backing, he facilitated his victory through excellent performance in a television debate and last-minute television commercials.

Once in office, Garrison cracked down on prostitution and the abuses of Bourbon Street bars and strip joints. He indicted Dowling and one of his assistants for criminal malfeasance, but the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. Garrison did not appeal. Garrison received national attention for a series of vice raids in the French Quarter, staged sometimes on a nightly basis. Newspaper headlines in 1962 praised Garrison&#x27;s efforts, &quot;Quarter Crime Emergency Declared by Police, DA. – Garrison Back, Vows Vice Drive to Continue – 14 Arrested, 12 more nabbed in Vice Raids.&quot; Garrison&#x27;s critics often point out that many of the arrests made by his office did not result in convictions, implying that he was in the habit of making arrests without evidence; however, assistant DA William Alford said that charges would, more often than not, be reduced or dropped if a relative of someone charged gained Garrison&#x27;s ear. Alford said Garrison had &quot;a heart of gold&quot;.

After a conflict with local criminal judges over his budget, Garrison accused them of racketeering and conspiring against him. The eight judges charged him with misdemeanor criminal defamation, and Garrison was convicted in January 1963. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction and struck down the state statute as unconstitutional. At the same time, Garrison indicted Judge Bernard Cocke with criminal malfeasance and, in two trials prosecuted by Garrison himself, Cocke was acquitted. Garrison charged nine policemen with brutality, but dropped the charges two weeks later. At a press conference, he accused the state parole board of accepting bribes, but could obtain no indictments. Critical of the state legislature, Garrison was unanimously censured by it for &quot;deliberately maligning all of the members&quot;. In 1965, running for reelection against Judge Malcolm O&#x27;Hara, Garrison won with 60 percent of the vote.

=== Kennedy assassination investigation ===

As New Orleans D.A., in late 1966, Garrison began an investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, after receiving several tips from Jack Martin that a man named David Ferrie may have been involved in the assassination. The result of Garrison&#x27;s investigation was the arrest and trial of New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw in 1969, with Shaw being unanimously acquitted less than one hour after the case went to the jury. Garrison was able to subpoena the Zapruder film from &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Thus, members of the American public – i.e., the jurors of the case – were shown the movie for the first time. Until the trial, the film rarely had been seen, and copies were made by assassination investigator Steve Jaffe, who was working with Garrison&#x27;s office. In 2015, Garrison&#x27;s lead investigator&#x27;s daughter released his copy of the film, along with a number of his personal papers from the investigation.

Garrison&#x27;s key witness against Shaw was Perry Russo, a 25-year-old insurance salesman from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. At the trial, Russo testified that he had attended a party at anti-Castro activist David Ferrie&#x27;s apartment. At the party, Russo said that Lee Harvey Oswald (whom Russo said was introduced to him as &quot;Leon Oswald&quot;), David Ferrie, and &quot;Clem Bertrand&quot; (whom Russo identified in the courtroom as Clay Shaw) had discussed killing President Kennedy. The conversation included plans for the &quot;triangulation of crossfire&quot; and alibis for the participants.

Russo&#x27;s version of events has been questioned by some historians and researchers, such as Patricia Lambert, once it became known that part of his testimony might have been induced by hypnosis and by the drug sodium pentothal (sometimes called &quot;truth serum&quot;). An early version of Russo&#x27;s testimony (as told in Assistant D.A. Andrew Sciambra&#x27;s memo, before Russo was subjected to sodium pentothal and hypnosis) fails to mention an &quot;assassination party&quot; and says that Russo met Shaw on two occasions, neither of which occurred at the party. However, in his book &quot;On the Trail of the Assassins&quot;, Garrison says that Russo had already discussed the party at Ferrie&#x27;s apartment before any &quot;truth serum&quot; was administered. Scambria said that the party information was simply accidentally left off the notes of his encounter with Russo. Throughout his life, Russo reiterated the same account of being present for a party at Ferrie&#x27;s house along with Mr. Bertrand, where the subject of Kennedy&#x27;s potential assassination had come up. Garrison defended his conduct regarding witness testimony, stating:
Before we introduced the testimony of our witnesses, we made them undergo independent verifying tests, including polygraph examination, truth serum and hypnosis. We thought this would be hailed as an unprecedented step in jurisprudence; instead, the press turned around and hinted that we had drugged our witnesses or given them posthypnotic suggestions to testify falsely.

In January 1968, Garrison subpoenaed Kerry Wendell Thornley – an acquaintance of Oswald&#x27;s from their days in the military – to appear before a grand jury, questioning him about his relationship with Oswald and his knowledge of other figures that Garrison believed were connected to the assassination. Thornley sought a cancellation of this subpoena on which he had to appear before the Circuit Court. Garrison charged Thornley with perjury after Thornley denied that he had been in contact with Oswald in any manner since 1959. The perjury charge was eventually dropped by Garrison&#x27;s successor, Harry Connick Sr. Also in 1968, Mort Sahl used his connection to get Garrison a spot on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson to discuss the assassination.

During Garrison&#x27;s 1973 bribery trial, tape recordings from March 1971 revealed that Garrison considered implicating publicly the former United States Air Force General and Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Charles Cabell, of conspiracy in the assassination of Kennedy after learning that he was the brother of Earle Cabell, the Dallas mayor in 1963. Theorizing that a plot to kill the president was masterminded out of New Orleans in conjunction with the CIA, with cooperation from the Dallas police department and city government, Garrison allegedly tasked his former chief investigator, Pershing Gervais, to look into the possibility that General Cabell had stayed in the city&#x27;s Fontainebleau Motel at the time of the assassination. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that there was no evidence that Gervais ever followed through with the request and that there was no further mention of General Cabell in Garrison&#x27;s investigation. The article also noted that, by the date in question, Gervais was no longer working for the district attorney in New Orleans. 

A U.S. talk-radio host, David Mendelsohn, conducted a comprehensive interview with Garrison that was broadcast in 1988 by KPFA in Berkeley, California. Alongside Garrison, the program featured the voices of Lee Harvey Oswald and &quot;JFK&quot; filmmaker Oliver Stone. Garrison explained that cover stories were circulated in an attempt to blame the killing on the Cubans and the Mafia, but that he blames the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy firmly on the CIA, which wanted to continue the Cold War. The very same reasonings as to why he thought that President Kennedy was killed were espoused by Garrison in filmed television appearances that he would make leading up to his death, the year after Stone&#x27;s release of his cinematic film &quot;JFK&quot;, largely based on Garrison&#x27;s pioneering role in the lone prosecution in the case of President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

== Later career and death ==

In 1973, Garrison was tried and found not guilty by the jury for accepting bribes to protect illegal pinball machine operations. In an interview with Pershing Gervais conducted by New Orleans reporter Rosemary James, Gervais had admitted to concocting the charges. In the same year, Garrison was defeated for reelection as district attorney by Harry Connick Sr. On April 15, 1978, Garrison won a special election over a Republican candidate, Thomas F. Jordan, for Louisiana&#x27;s 4th Circuit Court of Appeal judgeship, a position for which he was later reelected and which he held until his death.

In 1987, Garrison appeared in the film &quot;The Big Easy&quot; where he essentially played himself, and the next year he was featured in &quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot; series, airing in the United States beginning in 1988. After the Shaw trial, Garrison wrote three books on the Kennedy assassination, &quot;A Heritage of Stone&quot; (1970), &quot;The Star Spangled Contract&quot; (1976, fiction but based on the JFK assassination), and his best-seller, &quot;On the Trail of the Assassins&quot; (1988). &quot;A Heritage of Stone&quot;, published by Putnam, places responsibility for the assassination on the CIA and says the Warren Commission, the Executive Branch, members of the Dallas Police Department, the pathologists at Bethesda, and various others lied to the American public. The book does not mention Shaw or Garrison&#x27;s investigation of Shaw.

Garrison&#x27;s investigation received widespread attention through Oliver Stone&#x27;s film, &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), which was largely based on Garrison&#x27;s book as well as Jim Marrs&#x27; &quot;Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy&quot;. Kevin Costner played a fictionalized version of Garrison in the movie. Garrison himself had a small on-screen role in the film, playing United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren. Garrison also appears live and comments on the Shaw Trial in the documentary &quot;The JFK Assassination: The Jim Garrison Tapes&quot;, written and directed by actor John Barbour. Garrison died in 1992 and is survived by his five children. He is interred at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.

== Legacy ==

Garrison&#x27;s investigation and trial of Shaw has been described by critics as &quot;a fatally flawed case built on flimsy evidence that featured a chorus of dubious and even wacky witnesses&quot;. Political commentator George Will wrote that Garrison &quot;staged an assassination &#x27;investigation&#x27; that involved recklessness, cruelty, abuse of power, publicity mongering and dishonesty, all on a scale that strongly suggested lunacy leavened by cynicism.&quot; Former Orleans Parish district attorney Harry Connick Sr. said it was &quot;a travesty of justice&quot;, and that he &quot;thought it was one of the grossest, most extreme miscarriages of justice in the annals of American judicial history.&quot; Journalist Max Holland also described the investigation of Shaw as an &quot;egregious miscarriage of justice&quot;.

Others who have called Garrison&#x27;s case against Shaw a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; or &quot;travesty of justice&quot; include historian Alecia Long, as well as journalist Gerald Posner. Conspiracy researcher Harold Weisberg called it a &quot;tragedy&quot;. Political analyst and conspiracy believer Carl Oglesby was quoted as saying to &quot;have done a study of Garrison: I come out of it thinking that he is one of the really first-rate class-act heroes of this whole ugly story [the killing of John F. Kennedy and subsequent investigation].&quot; Conspiracy author David Lifton called Garrison &quot;intellectually dishonest, a reckless prosecutor, and a total charlatan&quot;. At the time, Garrison came under criticism from author and researcher Sylvia Meagher, who in 1967 wrote that &quot;as the Garrison investigation continued to unfold, it gave cause for increasingly serious misgivings about the validity of his evidence, the credibility of his witnesses, and the scrupulousness of his methods. According to Shaw&#x27;s defense team, witnesses, including Russo, claimed to have been bribed and threatened with perjury and contempt of court charges by Garrison in order to make his case against Shaw.

<doc id="236475" wikidata="Q15891834" url="?curid=236475" title="Trouble (board game)">
<text>Trouble (known as Frustration in the UK and Kimble in Finland) is a board game in which players compete to be the first to send four pieces all the way around a board. It is based on a traditional game called &quot;Frustration&quot; played on a wooden board with indentations for marble playing pieces and rules similar to Parcheesi. Pieces are moved according to the roll of a die using a contained device called a &quot;Pop-O-Matic&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Trouble&quot; was developed by the Kohner Brothers and initially manufactured by Irwin Toy Ltd., later by Milton Bradley (now part of Hasbro). The game was launched in America in 1965. The classic version is now marketed by Winning Moves Games USA. The gameplay, board, and concept is derivative of the British board game &quot;Ludo&quot;, itself based on the Indian board game &quot;pachisi&quot;.

A similar game called &quot;Headache&quot; was also produced by the Milton Bradley Company; besides a different track layout, its pawns are conical, in contrast to the cylindrical pieces used in &quot;Trouble&quot;.

A variation named &quot;Double Trouble&quot; was originally published by Milton Bradley in 1987. Each player moves two pieces along a path, using separate Pop-o-Matic dice-roller devices. 

== Gameplay ==

Players may move pieces out of their home onto their designated start space only when the die lands on &quot;6&quot;. Getting a &quot;6&quot; at any point in the game also allows the player to take another turn, even if the player cannot move any of their pieces (as they cannot land on any of their own pieces). They also may move a new piece out even if they have another piece currently in play, and can also do the same if another player&#x27;s piece is occupying their &quot;start&quot; space, but cannot do so when one of their own pieces is occupying their &quot;start&quot; space.

Pieces move clockwise around the track. Players can send opponents&#x27; pieces back to the start by landing on them. Pieces are protected from capture after arriving in the final four slots of the finish area. Unlike more complex race games such as Parcheesi, counters cannot be maneuvered to block opponents&#x27; moves.

===Pop-o-Matic die container===
The most notable feature of &quot;Trouble&quot; is the &quot;Pop-O-Matic&quot; die container. This device is a clear plastic hemisphere containing the die, placed over a flexible sheet. Players roll the die by pressing down quickly on the bubble, which flexes the sheet and causes the die to tumble upon its rebound. The Pop-O-Matic container produces a sound when it is used, and prevents the die from being lost (and players from cheating by improper rolling). It allows for quick die rolls, and players&#x27; turns can be performed in rapid succession. The die is imprinted with Arabic numerals rather than the traditional circular pips, although the circular pips are used in the Travel version, which contains a cover to keep the pegs from being lost.
If the die in the &quot;Pop-O-Matic&quot; container has not clearly landed on a number, then the player who popped it can tap the &quot;Pop-O-Matic&quot;, but may not re-pop while the die is in limbo.

<text>Phuket (; , , or &quot;Tongkah&quot;) is one of the southern provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country&#x27;s largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. Phuket lies off the west coast of mainland Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.

Phuket province, encompassing an area of , ranks as the second-smallest province in Thailand. Its size is about two-thirds the size of Singapore. Historically, Phuket Island was situated on a major trading route between India and China. This strategic location led to its frequent mention in the logs of foreign ships, including those from Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and England. Despite this attention from various European powers, Phuket was never colonized by any European nation.

Economically, the province&#x27;s wealth was initially derived from tin and rubber production. In more recent times, Phuket has transitioned to tourism as its primary source of income. More than 100,000 foreigners are estimated to have settled in Phuket.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Phuket&quot; (of which the digraph &quot;ph&quot; represents an aspirated ) is derived from the corruption of the word &quot;Bukit&quot; (Jawi: ) in Malay which means &quot;hill&quot;, as this is what the island appears like from a distance. With its geographical location in the Malay Peninsula, Phuket was historically inhabited by the Austronesian Malays, before it was settled by the Thais due to southward expansions of Siamese kingdoms, most recently the Rattanakosin Kingdom.

Phuket was formerly known as Thalang ( &quot;Tha-Laang&quot;), which is also derived from the old Malay &quot;Telong&quot; (Jawi: ) which means &quot;cape&quot;. The northern district of the province, which was the location of the old capital, still uses this name. In Western sources and navigation charts, it was known as Junk Ceylon (a corruption of the Malay &quot;Tanjung Salang&quot;; Jawi: ; i.e., &quot;Cape Salang&quot;).

==History==

===16th–18th century: European contact===
Fernão Mendes Pinto, a Portuguese explorer, arrived in Siam in 1545. His travel accounts provide insights into various parts of the country, including a detailed description of ports in the southern part of the Kingdom. Pinto&#x27;s records are among the earliest European accounts to mention Phuket, which he referred to as &quot;Junk Ceylon&quot;, a name used by the Portuguese in their maps. This designation appears seven times in his writings. According to Pinto, Junk Ceylon was a significant port of call for trading vessels, where they often stopped for supplies and provisions.

However, Pinto noted that during the mid-16th century, the island&#x27;s prominence was in decline. This downturn was attributed to the presence of pirates and the challenging sea conditions, which made the area less favorable for merchant vessels. In addition to Phuket, Pinto&#x27;s accounts also include references to other important port cities of the time, such as Patani and Ligor, the latter being the present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat.

During the 17th century, Junk Ceylon (now known as Phuket) was a focal point of international trade, particularly for its tin resources. The Dutch and English, and later the French after the 1680s, competed for trading opportunities on the island. In September 1680, the French East India Company&#x27;s ship arrived at the island and departed with a cargo full of tin.

In an effort to diminish Dutch and English influence in the region, the Siamese King Narai appointed a French medical missionary, Brother René Charbonneau of the Société des Missions Étrangères, as the governor of Junk Ceylon. Charbonneau held this position until 1685.
King Narai, in 1685, granted the French a tin monopoly in Phuket, formalized through an agreement with the French ambassador, the Chevalier de Chaumont. Subsequently, Sieur de Billy, previously the maître d&#x27;hôtel for Chaumont, was appointed as the governor of the island. However, following the Siamese revolution in 1688, the French presence in Siam was significantly reduced. On 10 April 1689, Desfarges led a military expedition to recapture Thalang in an attempt to re-establish French control in the region. This occupation was short-lived, with Desfarges returning to Puducherry in January 1690.

====1785: Burmese invasion====
Before the Burmese assault on Thalang in 1785, during what is known as the &quot;Nine Armies&#x27; Wars&quot;, Francis Light, a captain with the British East India Company, alerted the authorities in Phuket of the impending Burmese attack. Light&#x27;s warning came at a time when the island&#x27;s military governor had recently passed away, leading the Burmese to believe that Phuket could be easily conquered. However, Than Phu Ying Chan, the widow of the deceased governor, along with her sister Mook (คุณมุก), devised a strategic defense. They instructed the women of the island to dress as soldiers and position themselves along the walls of Thalang city. This ruse led the Burmese to overestimate the strength of the island&#x27;s defenses, prompting them to abort their attack and eventually retreat after a month-long siege, which ended on 13 March 1785. In recognition of their bravery and ingenuity, King Rama I bestowed the titles Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Si Sunthon upon the two sisters, celebrating them as heroines of Phuket.

The official seal of Phuket features a depiction of the Two Heroines Monument, located along Highway 402 in Phuket, in honor of the sisters. Encircled by a traditional Thai kranok pattern, this seal has been in use since 1985.

===19th–20th centuries===
During the reign of King Chulalongkorn, also known as Rama V, from 1 October 1868 to 23 October 1910, Phuket was designated as the administrative center for the tin-producing southern provinces of Siam (now Thailand). King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s tenure is noted for the modernization of the nation, encompassing governmental and social reforms, as well as negotiations involving territorial concessions to the British and French. Amid the pressures of Western expansionism during this period, King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s leadership is credited with maintaining Siam&#x27;s sovereignty, averting colonization.

In 1876, there was a significant uprising among Chinese laborers working in the tin mines of Phuket and its neighboring provinces. The unrest was reportedly influenced by the declining prices of tin and the government&#x27;s stringent fiscal policies at the time.

Phuket underwent another administrative change in 1933 when &quot;Monthon Phuket&quot; (มณฑลภูเก็ต) was dissolved, leading to Phuket&#x27;s establishment as a separate province.

===21st century (2001-present)===
On 26 December 2004, Phuket, along with other areas on Thailand&#x27;s west coast, experienced significant devastation due to a tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. This natural disaster had far-reaching impacts, resulting in approximately 5,300 fatalities in Thailand, and causing extensive damage and loss of life across South and Southeast Asia, totaling around two hundred thousand deaths. In Phuket, around 250 individuals, including foreign tourists, were reported deceased. Major beaches on Phuket&#x27;s west coast, including Kamala, Patong, Karon, and Kata, suffered substantial damage, as did some resorts and communities along the island&#x27;s southern shores. Notably, the Takua Pa District in Phang Nga province, north of Phuket, was among Thailand&#x27;s most severely affected areas, with significant casualties, including a considerable number of Burmese laborers. In response to the tsunami disaster, Thailand initiated the installation of a series of tsunami-detection buoys in December 2006. These buoys, part of a regional warning system in the Indian Ocean, are located approximately offshore, positioned between Thailand and Sri Lanka.

In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Phuket. By March of that year, Phuket and other regions in Southern Thailand implemented lockdown measures, including stay-at-home orders, a mandate for mask-wearing, and social distancing protocols. While these measures were relatively effective in controlling the spread of the virus, they had a significant impact on Phuket&#x27;s tourism-dependent economy. By 2022, Thailand transitioned towards the post-pandemic phase, marking the end of the country&#x27;s intensive COVID-19 response measures.

The murder of Nicole Sauvain-Weisskopf, a Swiss national on holiday, occurred in Phuket in August 2021.

==Symbols==
The provincial slogan is &quot;Pearl of the Andaman. Heavenly City of the South. Golden beaches. Two heroines. Virtue of Luang Pho Chaem.&quot; The provincial seal and flag shows the monument of the heroine sisters Thao Thep Krasattri and Thao Si Sunthon.

The provincial tree is &quot;Pterocarpus indicus&quot;, and the provincial flower is &quot;Bougainvillea&quot; sp. Phuket is an important pearl cultivation area, and is also nicknamed Pearl of the Andaman, on the ground, the pearl oyster &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot; is the provincial aquatic animal.

==Geography==

Phuket Island (Ko Phuket), the largest island in Thailand, is situated in the southern part of the country, within the Andaman Sea. The island is characterized by its mountainous terrain, with a mountain range extending from the north to the south along its western side. This range is part of the larger Phuket mountain range, which spans approximately from the Kra Isthmus.

The island&#x27;s highest point is traditionally cited as Khao Mai Thao Sip Song, with an altitude of above sea level. However, there are reports suggesting the presence of an unnamed peak in the Kamala hills, behind Kathu waterfall, which may reach an elevation of 542 meters above sea level.

As per the 2000 census, Phuket&#x27;s population was 249,446, which increased to 525,709 by the 2010 census. This marked the highest growth rate of all provinces in Thailand, averaging 7.4 percent annually. The current population of Phuket is estimated to be around 600,000, comprising a diverse mix of migrants, international expatriates, Thais registered in other provinces, and local inhabitants. However, the official registered population, which counts only those included in a &quot;thabian ban&quot; or house registration book, was reported as 360,905 at the end of 2012. It&#x27;s important to note that this figure does not encompass all residents, as many are not registered in the house registration system.

Phuket Island, situated approximately south of Bangkok, spans an area of , not accounting for its smaller islets. It is accompanied by several other islands including Ko Lone (), Ko Maprao (), Ko Naka Yai (), Ko Racha Noi (), Ko Racha Yai (), and Ko Sire, the second largest, covering .

The island measures in length from north to south, and its width extends to . Around 60 percent of Phuket Island is covered with forests, rubber, and palm oil plantations. Its west coast is adorned with several sandy beaches, while the east coast features predominantly muddy beaches. The southernmost tip of the island is marked by Laem Phromthep ( &quot;Brahma&#x27;s Cape&quot;), known for being a popular viewpoint.

In the northern, more mountainous part of the island, the Khao Phra Thaeo No-Hunting Area spans over , dedicated to preserving rainforest ecosystems. This reserve&#x27;s three highest peaks include Khao Prathiu (), Khao Bang Pae (), and Khao Phara (). Additionally, the Sirinat National Park on the northwest coast, established in 1981, encompasses an area of , including of marine area. This park is significant for encompassing the Nai Yang Beach, a nesting site for sea turtles. The total forested area of Phuket is approximately , accounting for 20.6 percent of the province&#x27;s total area.

===Climate===
Phuket, characterized by a tropical monsoon climate under the Köppen climate classification, experiences relatively uniform temperatures throughout the year due to its equatorial location. The region typically observes an average annual high temperature around and an average annual low around . The climate of Phuket is divided into two distinct seasons: a dry season extending from December through March, and a wet season that spans the remaining eight months of the year. Notably, even during the dry season, Phuket is subject to occasional rainfall. On average, the city receives approximately of rainfall annually.


==Demographics==

In Thailand, Buddhism is the predominant religion, with a notable presence in Phuket. Approximately 20% of Phuket&#x27;s population adheres to Islam, primarily descendants of the island&#x27;s original Austronesian inhabitants. This Muslim community includes a substantial number of individuals of Malay descent. The ethnic composition of Phuket also includes a significant proportion of people of Chinese ancestry, many of whom are descendants of tin miners who migrated to the island during the 19th century. The Peranakan community, locally referred to as &quot;Phuket Babas&quot;, forms a distinct part of this Chinese demographic, with historical links to the Peranakans of Penang and Malacca.

According to the preliminary results of the 2010 census, Phuket had a population of 525,018, including approximately 115,881 expatriates, accounting for 21.1% of the total population. However, these figures may not be entirely accurate, as the Phuket Provincial Employment Office has recorded over 64,000 legally residing workers from Burma (Myanmar), Laos, and Cambodia, suggesting a higher actual population. The Thai census of 2015 reported a population of 386,605 for Phuket.
During peak tourist seasons, Phuket experiences a significant influx of visitors, with the population increasing to over one million. Tourists, predominantly from Western Europe, China, Russia, and the United States, are drawn to the island around Christmas, contributing to this seasonal population increase.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
Phuket is divided into three districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;), which are further divided into 17 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;), and 103 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 12 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Phuket has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Kathu and Patong have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 9 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 6 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Economy==

Tin mining historically played a pivotal role in the economy of Phuket from the 16th century until its decline in the 20th century. In contemporary times, the economy of Phuket is primarily supported by two sectors: rubber tree plantations, contributing significantly to Thailand&#x27;s status as the world&#x27;s leading rubber producer, and the tourism industry.

The development of Phuket&#x27;s tourism sector began in earnest in the 1980s, with the west coast beaches, notably Patong, Karon, and Kata, emerging as key tourist destinations. Following the 2004 tsunami, efforts were made to restore all affected buildings and attractions. The island has since undergone extensive development, evidenced by the construction of new hotels, apartments, and houses.

In a 2005 report by Fortune Magazine, Phuket was listed among the top five global retirement destinations. The island&#x27;s appeal as a retirement location is attributed to various factors, including its climate, lifestyle, and amenities.

The year 2017 marked a significant influx of tourists to Phuket, with the island welcoming approximately 10 million visitors, predominantly from overseas. China was noted as the primary source of these foreign tourists. The tourism sector in Phuket played a crucial role in Thailand&#x27;s economy, generating about 385 billion baht in revenue, which constituted nearly 14% of the nation&#x27;s total earnings of 2.77 trillion baht in that year.

In the first half of 2019, Phuket experienced a decrease in tourist arrivals, which impacted the local hospitality industry. This trend was marked by reduced hotel occupancy rates and intensified price competition among accommodations. Consequently, there was a noted decrease in revenue per available room (RevPAR). Analysts attribute this downturn to a combination of fewer tourists and an oversupply of hotel rooms. However, despite the decline in tourist numbers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) reported a 3.1% increase in tourism revenues for the same period.

Estimates of the total number of hotel rooms in Phuket vary. According to Oxfam, Phuket has approximately 60,000 hotel rooms to cater to its 9.1 million annual visitors. Contrasting figures were presented in reports by the Bangkok Post in September 2019. One report indicated that Phuket has around 600 hotels comprising 40,000 rooms. A separate report from three weeks earlier estimated 93,941 available hotel rooms, excluding villas and hostels, with an expectation of an additional 15,000 rooms by 2024. These varying figures highlight the difficulty in accurately quantifying the total number of hotel accommodations in the region.

In 2023, Phuket experienced a 15% increase in property prices with demand driven by an influx of Russian and Ukrainian nationals. The number of luxury villas launched in Phuket during the first six months of 2023 surged 12 times to 541 units worth a total 29.6 billion baht, from 45 units valued at 886 million baht the previous year.

==Transportation==
;Air
Phuket International Airport (HKT) initiated an expansion project in September 2012, with an allocated budget of 5.7 billion baht (approximately US$185.7 million). This expansion, which was scheduled for completion by 14 February 2016, aimed to increase the airport&#x27;s annual passenger handling capacity from 6.5 million to 12.5 million and included the construction of a new international terminal.

;Rail
Phuket does not have a direct rail line. The nearest train stations are in Surat Thani and Khiri Rat Nikhom, approximately away.

;City transit
The songthaews is a prevalent mode in Phuket, they provide an economical means of transport between towns and various beaches. There are also conventional bus services, and motorcycle taxis are numerous in the main town and Patong Beach area. Traditional tuk-tuks have largely been replaced by small vans, predominantly red, with some in yellow or green. Taxi services in Phuket generally operate with fixed rates. For travel from the airport to Phuket Town and major beaches, privately operated buses are available. Additionally, the ride-share service Grab is frequently recommended by locals as a convenient transportation option.
;Bus
Phuket&#x27;s Bus Station 2 BKS Terminal serves as the main link for transportation to and from Bangkok, as well as other major cities and provinces in Thailand, and is approximately four kilometers north of Phuket&#x27;s town center and port area. It provides connections to various local transport options, including tuk-tuks, metered taxis, motorcycle taxis, songthaews, and local buses, facilitating access to the island&#x27;s numerous beaches and resorts. Daily scheduled bus services by private and government companies originate from Bangkok&#x27;s Mo Chit and Southern Terminal stations.

;Tram
In 2018, the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) announced plans for the development of a tram network in Phuket, with bidding set to begin in 2020. This project, estimated at 39 billion baht, forms part of the government&#x27;s Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) initiative, aimed at accelerating its implementation. The proposed tram network, spanning approximately with 23 stations, is designed to extend from Takua Thung District in Phang Nga province to Chalong in Phuket. The initial phase of the project plans to connect Phuket International Airport with Chalong, covering a distance of around , with a projected completion timeline of three years.

;Ferry
Ferry services serve neighboring islands, such as Phi Phi and Koh Lanta. They operate daily from Rassada Pier and Tonsai Pier.

== Health ==
6 hospitals exist in Phuket. The main hospital in Phuket operated by the Ministry of Public Health is Vachira Phuket Hospital, with smaller hospitals at Thalang and Patong. 3 Private hospitals exist which are Phuket International Hospital, Bangkok Hospital Phuket, and Mission Hospital Phuket.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at the sub-national level using the Human Achievement Index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.


== Sports ==
Phuket F.C., also known as The Southern Sea Kirins, was established in 2009 and subsequently joined the Regional League South Division. The team designated Surakul Stadium as their home ground for matches. Sirirak Konthong took the helm as the inaugural coach of the team. In their formative year, Phuket F.C. demonstrated significant progress in the league.

The 2010 season marked a notable achievement for Phuket F.C., as the team clinched the title in the Southern Regional Division 2. Despite a loss to Buriram FC in the final, Phuket F.C. secured second place in the Division 2 Champions League. This performance facilitated their promotion to the Thai Division 1 League for the 2011 season.

In 2017, Phuket F.C. was officially dissolved. This decision was influenced by financial difficulties, particularly issues surrounding the termination of contracts.

The following year, in 2018, Phuket F.C. underwent significant changes. The club merged with Banbueng F.C., a move that resulted in a substantial reorganization. By 2019, this merged entity adopted the name Phuket City. However, this renaming was short-lived. Subsequent changes in the club&#x27;s management, particularly a takeover by the board members of Banbueng F.C., led to a reversion to the name Banbueng F.C. Along with this change in nomenclature, the club relocated its home ground to the IPE Chonburi Stadium in Chonburi.

In a separate development, Patong City, another football club, marked a notable milestone in 2020. The club participated in the 2020–21 Thai League 3 Southern Region, marking its first appearance in this league. This participation signified a new chapter in the club&#x27;s history and its evolving presence in regional football.

<doc id="236486" wikidata="Q17201" url="?curid=236486" title="Coat of arms of the Philippines">
<text>The coat of arms of the Philippines (; ) features the eight-rayed sun of the Philippines with each ray representing the eight provinces (Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Manila, Laguna, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Tarlac) which were placed under martial law by Governor-General Ramón Blanco Sr. during the Philippine Revolution, and the three five-pointed stars representing the three major island groups of Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao.

On the blue field on the dexter side is the North American bald eagle of the United States, and on the red field on the sinister side is the &quot;lion rampant&quot; of the coat of arms of the Kingdom of León of Spain, both representing the country&#x27;s colonial past. The current arms, which shares many features of the national flag, was designed by Filipino artist and heraldist Captain Galo B. Ocampo.

==Blazon==
The blazon of the coat of arms from Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines (Republic Act 8491) is as follows:

Its original blazoning according to Commonwealth Act No. 731 is: 
==History==
===Spanish Colonial Period===

The Philippines&#x27; codified heraldry when King Philip II of Spain authorized the first coat of arms to the City of Manila through a royal decree issued on 20 March 1596 is, in part, as follows:

The design of the arms of Manila had changed throughout the years, the castle had adopted various different forms, a crowned sea lion was present later, and in the 19th century, King Ferdinand VII granted the use and placement of the royal crown above the castle itself as an augmentation of honor by royal cedula of April 23, 1826.

Along with this, the lesser arms of the Spanish monarch was used. The design patterned after the national standard of Spain consisted of three fleur-de-lis surrounded by a quartered flag of Castille, represented by two golden castles located on the red field and two red lions on a white field. Minor details of the arms had changed over the years but the basic design elements remained.

===Philippine Revolutionary Period===
During the 1896 Philippine Revolution, the Filipino leaders had no permanent political symbol, but, two different emblems were easily adopted. Both consisted of an equilateral triangle, but differed on what symbols were placed inside the triangle. Many documents of the Katipunan bore a letter K which stood for &quot;Kalayaan&quot; (Liberty), while some had the rising mythological sun in the center. General Emilio Aguinaldo, officially the first President of the Philippines, adopted the mythological sun and the three stars in each angle of the equilateral triangle as his emblem.

===American Colonial Period===
During the American Occupation, a law was enacted prescribing a new coat of arms for the islands. The Spanish-era arms of the City of Manila were used until 1905, when the Philippine Commission adopted the &quot;new arms and great seal of the Philippine Islands&quot; designed by Gaillard Hunt of the US State Department. It consisted of thirteen alternating red-and-white stripes representing the Thirteen Colonies; a chief blue above, the honor color, and over them in an oval the arms of Manila with the castle of Spain and the sea lion prominently displayed. It also bore as its crest an American eagle, the symbol of United States. Beneath the shield was the scroll with the words &quot;Philippine Islands&quot;. It remained unaltered until the inauguration of Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935.

===Commonwealth Era===
During the Commonwealth, extensive reform was made to the government in preparation for Philippine independence. One of major changes was changing the symbol for Filipinos. &quot;The Arms and Great Seal of the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines&quot; was approved in 1935, the number of stripes reduced from thirteen to two and three five-pointed stars added. The sea lion was made gold instead of silver and the eagle was slightly enlarged and placed closer to the arm. The word &quot;Commonwealth of the Philippines&quot; replaced &quot;Philippine Islands&quot; in the scroll below; it also incorporated the modified coat of arms of the City of Manila.

On December 15, 1938, President Manuel L. Quezon created the Special Committee of Arms of the Philippines. After almost two years of study, the committee recommended certain modifications to the coat of arms of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. They recommended that the eight-ray Philippine sun must be the point of honor. It was revised in 1940. It featured two stripes, blue on the sinister (left) side and red on the dexter (right) side of the shield; a white field above, studded with three five-pointed stars equidistant from each other; over them, the eight-rayed sun with each ray flanked on both sides by minor rays inside an oval. On the crest is the American eagle, its talon grasping an olive branch with eight leaves and eight fruits, and the left talon grasping three spears. Beneath the shield was the scroll with the inscription &quot;Philippines&quot;.

After providing the various branches of the government with their own symbols, President Quezon created the Philippine Heraldic Committee in 1940. The committee was assigned the studying and recommending the designs and symbolism for official seals of Philippines&#x27; political subdivision, cities, and government institutions.

The 1941 coat of arms was short-lived and the 1938 iteration of the symbol was restored. Both symbols were also used as a presidential symbol through executive orders.

The heraldic work of the committee was suspended during the Pacific War.

===Second Philippine Republic===
During the Second Philippine Republic, a more nationalistic policy were adopted and the seal was revised. Foreign components of the Filipino heraldic symbol which previously represented its colonial links to Spain and United States were removed. Instead, salient features of the flag and seal of the short-lived Philippine Republic were incorporated, consisting of the eight-ray mythological sun and three stars located beneath the equilateral triangle. Written within three sets of two marginal lines of the three sides of the triangle were &quot;Kalayaan, Kapayapaan, Katarungan&quot; (Liberty, Peace, Justice). Around the seal was a double marginal circle within which was written &quot;Republika ng Pilipinas&quot; (Republic of the Philippines).

===Post World War II and full independence===
After World War II, President Sergio Osmeña reactivated the Philippine Heraldic Committee. The current design pursuant to Commonwealth Act No. 731 was approved by the Congress of the Philippines on July 3, 1946. It was designed by Captain Galo B. Ocampo, Secretary of the Philippine Heraldry Committee.

During the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos, &quot;Isang Bansa, Isang Diwa&quot; (One Nation, One Spirit) became the national motto of the Philippines. It was immediately incorporated into the national seal, replacing the words &quot;Republic of the Philippines&quot;, which were originally inscribed in a scroll beneath the arms. The decree for this purpose was approved by the Office of the President on June 9, 1978. However, during the administration of President Corazon Aquino in 1986, the decree was revoked and reinstated the full English name of the country. The Administrative Code of 1987 provided that the inscription on the scroll could also be rendered in the national language.

The original English words were replaced by its Filipino translation, , pursuant to Republic Act No. 8491 on February 12, 1998, coinciding with the centennial of the Philippine declaration of independence.

== Chronology ==
=== Spanish East Indies ===
During the Spanish colonial period, the lesser arms of the Spanish Sovereign were used. The seal of Manila was also issued under royal decree by Philip II (for whom the islands were named) in 1596. Note that the Pillars of Hercules or the Golden Fleece were not always displayed and the arms themselves were sometimes solely used.

=== First Philippine Republic ===
After the expulsion of the Spanish colonial government by the Philippine Revolutionary Army and the Malolos Constitution was ratified, the government had formally been established.

=== Commonwealth and Second world war eras ===
After the signing of the 1898 Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish–American War, Spain ceded control of the Philippines and several other possessions to the United States of America. The following arms were used in the period after the cession, during the Commonwealth, and throughout the Second World War.
=== Sovereignty ===
The following were used upon the Islands&#x27; achievement of full sovereignty in 1946. The arms as designed by Captain Galo B. Ocampo have retained their basic design since, with only minor alterations made due to political and cultural considerations.

A stylized form of the arms was formerly used on the jersey of the Philippine men&#x27;s national basketball team (until 2012), and appears with the word &quot;Pilipinas&quot; emblazoned above it. In addition, many coats of arms of national and private institutions, as well as Philippine towns and cities, are inspired by the national coat of arms.

<text>The Beagle 2 was an inoperative British Mars lander that was transported by the European Space Agency&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Mars Express&quot; mission. It was intended to conduct an astrobiology mission that would have looked for evidence of past life on Mars.

The spacecraft was successfully deployed from the &quot;Mars Express&quot; on 19 December 2003 and was scheduled to land on the surface of Mars on 25 December. ESA, however, received no communication from the lander at its expected landing time on Mars, and declared the mission lost in February 2004 after numerous attempts to contact the spacecraft were made.

The &quot;Beagle 2&quot; fate remained a mystery until January 2015, when it was located on the surface of Mars in a series of images from NASA&#x27;s &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; HiRISE camera. The images showed it landed safely but two of its four solar panels failed to deploy, blocking the spacecraft&#x27;s communications antenna.

The &quot;Beagle 2&quot; is named after , the ship that took the naturalist Charles Darwin on his round-the-world voyage.

==Background==
&quot;Beagle 2&quot; was conceived by a group of British academics headed by Professor Colin Pillinger of the Open University in collaboration with the University of Leicester. The project was designed and developed by several UK academics and companies. The spacecraft&#x27;s name reflects its goal of searching for signs of past or present life on Mars. According to Pillinger:

&quot;HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; was the ship that took [Charles] Darwin on his voyage around the world in the 1830s and led to our knowledge about life on Earth making a real quantum leap. We hope &quot;Beagle 2&quot; will do the same thing for life on Mars.&quot;

A ellipse centered on at Isidis Planitia, an enormous, flat, sedimentary basin that overlies the boundary between the ancient highlands and the northern plains of Mars, was chosen as the landing site. The lander was expected to operate for about 180 days and an extended mission of up to one Martian year (687 Earth days) was thought possible. The &quot;Beagle 2&quot; lander&#x27;s objectives were to characterise the landing site geology, mineralogy, geochemistry, and oxidation state of the physical properties of the atmosphere and surface layers; collect data on Martian meteorology and climate; and search for biosignatures.

The principal investigator, Colin Pillinger, set up a consortium to design and build &quot;Beagle 2&quot;. The principal members and their initial responsibilities were:
*Open University – Consortium leader &amp; scientific experiments
*University of Leicester – Project management, Mission management, Flight Operations Team, instrument management, and scientific experiments
*Astrium – Main industrial partner
*Martin-Baker – Entry, descent and landing system
*Logica – Cruise, entry, descent and landing software
*SCISYS – Ground segment and lander software
*University of Wales, Aberystwyth – Robotic arm
*McLaren Applied Technologies - composite materials for the solar panels

Astrium took over responsibility for program management, and Leicester assumed responsibility for mission management which involved the preparations for the operations post launch and the operations control centre.

In an effort to publicise the project and gain financial support, its designers sought and received the endorsement and participation of British artists. The mission&#x27;s call-sign was composed by the band Blur, and the &#x27;test card&#x27; (Calibration Target Plate) intended for calibrating &quot;Beagle 2&quot; cameras and spectrometers after landing was painted by Damien Hirst.

The Lander Operations Control Center (LOCC), from which the spacecraft was to be controlled, was located at the National Space Centre in Leicester and was visible to the public visiting the centre. The control centre included operational systems for controlling &quot;Beagle 2&quot;, analysis tools for processing engineering and scientific telemetry, virtual reality tools for preparing activity sequences, communications systems, and the Ground Test Model (GTM). The GTM was composed of builds of the &quot;Beagle 2&quot; systems, collected together to provide a full set of lander electronics. The GTM was used nearly continuously to validate the engineering and science commands, rehearse the landing sequence, and validate the onboard software.

===Funding===
The budget is secret but was estimated to be between in 2004, which at then-currency exchange rates would be about or . &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine reported a budget of for &quot;Beagle 2&quot;, and another outlet said . Some of the work is known to have been donated or done at-cost.

==Spacecraft and subsystems==

===Robotic arm and analysers===
&quot;Beagle 2&quot; has a robotic arm known as the Payload Adjustable Workbench (PAW) that was designed to be extended after landing. The arm is long when fully extended, and it can reach about to the nearest rocks. The PAW contains a pair of stereoscopic cameras, a microscope with a 6-micrometre resolution, a Mössbauer spectrometer, an X-ray spectrometer, a drill for collecting rock samples and a spot lamp.

Rock samples were to be passed by the PAW into a mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph in the body of the lander. The Gas Analysis Package (GAP) was to measure the relative proportions of isotopes of carbon and methane. Since carbon is thought to be the basis of all life, these readings could have revealed whether the samples contained the remnants of living organisms. Atmospheric methane is another signature of existing life, although geological processes can also be a source.

===PLUTO===
&quot;Beagle 2&quot; is equipped with a small sample retrieval tool named Planetary Undersurface Tool or PLUTO (nicknamed the mole), which would have been deployed by the robotic arm. PLUTO has a compressed spring mechanism that was designed to enable it to move across the surface at a rate of 20 mm per second and to burrow into the ground, collecting a subsurface sample in a cavity in its tip. PLUTO is attached to the lander by a power cable that could be used as a winch to bring the sample back to the lander. It had the capability to burrow to depths of .

===Specifications===

The lander is shaped like a shallow bowl with a diameter of and a depth of . The lander&#x27;s cover is hinged and folded open to reveal the craft&#x27;s interior, which holds a UHF antenna, the long robotic arm, and the scientific equipment. The main body also contains the battery, telecommunications, electronics, central processor, heaters, additional payload items, and radiation and oxidation sensors. The lid itself should have unfolded to expose four disk-shaped solar arrays. The lander package, including heat shield, parachutes, and airbags, had a mass of at launch but the lander was only at touchdown.

The ground segment was derived from the European Space Agency software kernel known as SCOS2000. In keeping with the low cost of the mission, the control software was the first of its type designed on a laptop computer.

==Mission profile==


&quot;Mars Express&quot; was launched from Baikonur on 2 June 2003 at 17:45 UTC. &quot;Beagle 2&quot; was initially mounted on the top deck of the European Space Agency&#x27;s &quot;Mars Express&quot; orbiter. It was released from the orbiter on a ballistic trajectory towards Mars on 19 December 2003. &quot;Beagle 2&quot; coasted for six days after release and entered the Martian atmosphere at about . Its expected landing was on 2:54 UT on 25 December. The lander was protected from the heat of entry by a heat shield coated with NORCOAT, an ablating material made by EADS. Compression of the Martian atmosphere and radiation from the hot gas are estimated to have led to a peak heating rate of around 100 W/cm2.

After deceleration in the Martian atmosphere, parachutes deployed and at about above the surface, large airbags inflated around the lander to protect it when it hit the surface. Landing occurred at about 02:45 UTC on 25 December 2003.

After analysis of the imagery obtained in 2015, it has been conjectured after landing, the bags deflated and the top of the lander opened. These images suggest at most only two of the four solar panels were deployed. A signal was supposed to be sent to &quot;Mars Express&quot; after landing and another the next (local) morning to confirm &quot;Beagle 2&quot; survived the landing and the first night on Mars. A panoramic image of the landing area was then supposed to be taken using the stereo camera and a pop-up mirror, after which the lander arm would have been released. The lander arm was to dig up samples to be deposited in the instruments for study, and the &quot;mole&quot; would have been deployed, crawling across the surface to a distance of about from the lander and burrowing under rocks to collect soil samples for analysis.

The British government spent more than () on &quot;Beagle 2&quot;, with the remainder of the total () coming from the private sector.

==Mission failure==
Although the &quot;Beagle 2&quot; craft successfully deployed from the &quot;Mars Express&quot;, confirmation of a successful landing was not forthcoming. It should have come on 25 December 2003 when &quot;Beagle 2&quot; was to have contacted NASA&#x27;s &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot; spacecraft. In the following days, the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank failed to pick up a signal from &quot;Beagle 2&quot;. The team said they were &quot;still hopeful&quot; of finding a successful return signal.

Attempts were made throughout January and February 2004 to contact &quot;Beagle 2&quot; using &quot;Mars Express&quot;. The first of these occurred on 7 January 2004. Although regular calls were made, hope was placed on communication occurring on 12 January, when &quot;Beagle 2&quot; was pre-programmed to expect the &quot;Mars Express&quot; probe to fly overhead, and on 2 February, when the probe was supposed to resort to the last communication back-up mode, Auto-transmit. No communication was ever established with &quot;Beagle 2&quot;, which was declared lost on 6 February 2004 by the &quot;Beagle 2&quot; Management Board. On 11 February, the ESA announced an inquiry into the failure of &quot;Beagle 2&quot; would be held. The board of inquiry was unable to find concrete reasons for the probe&#x27;s failure and listed plausible reasons on the report they released on 24 August 2004.

On 20 December 2005, Pillinger released specially processed images from the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; that suggested &quot;Beagle 2&quot; had landed in a crater at the landing site on Isidis Planitia. It was claimed the blurry images showed the primary impact site as a dark patch and, a short distance away, &quot;Beagle 2&quot; surrounded by the deflated airbags and with its solar panels extended. &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; HiRISE camera imaged the area in February 2007 and revealed the crater was empty.

Pillinger speculated higher than expected levels of dust in the Martian atmosphere, which captures heat, caused it to expand and reduce in density so the parachutes were not able to sufficiently slow the probe&#x27;s descent. This would cause the landing to be too hard, damaging or destroying the probe. A number of other failure hypotheses were produced at the time. If the Martian atmosphere was thinner than expected, the parachute&#x27;s effectiveness would be reduced and therefore cause the lander to hit the surface with enough speed to destroy it. Turbulence in the atmosphere, which would affect the parachute, was also examined.

Failures in missions to Mars are common. As of 2010, of 38 launch attempts to reach the planet, only 19 had succeeded. Failures are sometimes informally called the Mars Curse.

==ESA/UK inquiry report==

In May 2004, the report from the Commission of Inquiry on &quot;Beagle 2&quot; was submitted to ESA and the UK&#x27;s science minister Lord Sainsbury. Initially the full report was not published on the grounds of confidentiality but a list of 19 recommendations was announced to the public.

David Southwood, ESA&#x27;s Director of Science, provided four scenarios of possible failures:

* &quot;Beagle 2&quot; entered in atmospheric conditions outside the range assumed by its designers and could have burnt up. The scenario it may have &quot;bounced off into space&quot; was put forward but this does not stand up to close technical scrutiny. The amount of dust in the atmosphere often widely varies, changing its density and temperature characteristics. The chosen margins on the design of the heat shield and the thermal loads it can withstand mean the burn-up scenario is unlikely given the steep entry-flight-path angle, the craft could conceivably have left the atmosphere again.
* &quot;Beagle 2&quot; parachute or cushioning airbags failed to deploy or deployed at the wrong time. This is supported by the observation throughout the transfer to Mars, the out-gassing of some substance and subsequent condensation on optical components of the &quot;Mars Express&quot; spacecraft carrying the &quot;Beagle 2&quot; lander was observed. This observation would be consistent with a leak in the gas generators of &quot;Beagle 2&quot; airbags;
* &quot;Beagle 2&quot; backshell tangled with the parachute, preventing it from opening properly. It is not clear whether the difference in air drag between the probe with the parachute deployed and the back shell of the heat shield is sufficient to guarantee a safe separation distance;
* &quot;Beagle 2&quot; became wrapped up in its airbags or parachute on the surface and could not open. Entanglement with the parachute appears plausible because the parachute&#x27;s strop was shortened from the original design to save mass. Assuming the airbags deployed, &quot;Beagle 2&quot; would have bounced off the surface into the descending parachute.

In addition, further scenarios appeared plausible and consistent with the available body of data:

* &quot;Beagle 2&quot; may have jettisoned its airbags before it had come to a complete rest on the surface. For mass and cost reasons, the airbag-jettison device was designed to be triggered by a timer rather than by acceleration sensors that would have discerned when the lander package had stopped moving. Because the landing package of NASA&#x27;s Spirit rover mission rebounded off the surface in Gusev crater numerous times before coming to a standstill—taking much more time than anticipated—&quot;Beagle 2&quot; timer may have been set to a too-short time;
* The parachute deployment sequence was designed to be triggered by three accelerometers. The system was not designed for a &quot;best out of three&quot; logic but the first accelerometer was designed to compute a safe deployment velocity had been reached; this would trigger the parachute deployment sequence, even if the accelerometer readout was faulty.

In February 2005, following comments from the House of Commons Select committee on science and technology, the report was made public and Leicester University independently published a detailed mission report, including possible failure modes and a &quot;lessons learned&quot;.

All above hypotheses were disproved in 2015 after the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed the remains of the lander: pictures show the probe landed safely and started its operations, deploying some of the solar panels before an on-ground failure prevented the full deployment of all panels; this prevented the onboard antenna, hidden under the last solar panel, from gaining visibility to any orbiter, making any form of communication with the lander impossible and leading to mission loss. This status is detailed below.

==Discovery of location==
The location of &quot;Beagle 2&quot; on Mars was unknown from late 2003 to early 2015. On 16 January 2015, more than eleven years after its loss and eight months after Colin Pillinger died, news sources confirmed NASA&#x27;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had located the lander, which is lying on the surface of Isidis Planitia at , about from the planned centre of its landing zone.

On 26 April 2016, new computer vision methods stacked multiple new images together to create a view of the lander. The technique called Super-Resolution Restoration (SRR) allows improvement in resolution by taking multiple views then intensively processing them. At the time, it took up to four days on the fastest-available computers to compute one improved image from five 1,000-by-2,000-pixel images.

===Lander status===
Imaging analysis appears to show the probe on the surface and partially deployed, in the expected landing area, with objects that have been interpreted as being its parachute and back cover nearby. Although several interpretations of the image are possible, all involve incomplete deployment of the probe&#x27;s solar panels. Images suggest one of the &quot;petals&quot; on which the solar panels of the lander are mounted failed to fully open, preventing deployment of its radio antenna and blocking communication. As the probe&#x27;s antenna is beneath the last panel, it would have been unable to transmit or receive in such a configuration so the lander would have been beyond recovery even if its systems were still operational. Possible failure scenarios include mechanical damage during landing, fouling of the deployment mechanism and obstruction of the panels by an airbag.
Eleven years after the landing, ESA said; &quot;&quot;Beagle 2&quot; made it to the surface. This vindicates the engineering team&#x27;s approach to landing on Mars.&quot; At a news conference in London, the UKSA noted; &quot;&quot;Beagle 2&quot; is no longer lost&quot;. In reviews of lost Mars missions, &quot;Beagle 2&quot; and its rediscovery are typically noted.

After &quot;Beagle 2&quot; was found, apparently intact and with some solar panels deployed, the events following its landing were re-evaluated. Because the early phase of mission ran on chemical battery power, it is possible the lander&#x27;s Solid State Mass Memory (SSMM) recorded some data, even if it could not obtain full power from its solar panels. It might eventually be possible to retrieve the data. A study has revealed &quot;Beagle 2&quot; may have gone into its pre-programmed surface operations mode and collected data after landing but did not transmit it or the transmission was blocked by a closed panel.

==Follow-on mission proposals==
Further use of some features of the &quot;Beagle 2&quot; mission design have been proposed for other mission concepts:
*Beagle 2007
*Beagle 2e Evolution (Beagle 3)
*BeagleNet (multiple Beagles and a mini-rover)
*Beagle to the Moon
*ARTEMIS (multiple small Mars landers)
*MARGE (reuse an instrument)

Beagle 2&#x27;s PLUTO mole was noted in the development of InSight&#x27;s Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), an instrument that also uses a self-digging arm.

<text>Filipino ( ; , ) is the national language ( / ) of the Philippines, the main lingua franca (&quot;Karaniwang wika&quot;), and one of the two official languages (&quot;Wikang opisyal&quot;/&quot;Opisyal na wika&quot;) of the country, along with English. It is only a de facto and not a de jure standardized form of the Tagalog language, as spoken and written in Metro Manila, the National Capital Region, and in other urban centers of the archipelago. The 1987 Constitution mandates that Filipino be further enriched and developed by the other languages of the Philippines.

Filipino, like other Austronesian languages, commonly uses verb-subject-object order, but can also use subject-verb-object order. Filipino follows the trigger system of morphosyntactic alignment that is common among Philippine languages. It has head-initial directionality. It is an agglutinative language but can also display inflection. It is not a tonal language and can be considered a pitch-accent language and a syllable-timed language. It has nine basic parts of speech.

==Background==
The Philippines is a multilingual state with 175 living languages originating and spoken by various ethno-linguistic groups. Many of these languages descend from a common Malayo-Polynesian language due to the Austronesian migration from Taiwan. The common Malayo-Polynesian language split into different languages, and usually through the Malay language, the lingua franca of maritime Southeast Asia, these were able to adopt terms that ultimately originate from other languages such as Japanese, Hokkien, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Arabic. The Malay language was generally used by the ruling classes and the merchants from the states and various cultures in the Philippine archipelago for international communication as part of maritime Southeast Asia. In fact, Filipinos first interacted with the Spaniards using the Malay language. In addition to this, 16th-century chroniclers of the time noted that the kings and lords in the islands usually spoke around five languages.

Spanish intrusion into the Philippine islands started in 1565 with the fall of Cebu. The eventual capital established by Spain for its settlement in the Philippines was Manila, situated in a Tagalog-speaking region, after the capture of Manila from the Muslim Kingdom of Luzon ruled by Raja Matanda with the heir apparent Raja Sulayman and the Hindu-Buddhist Kingdom of Tondo ruled by Lakan Dula. After its fall to the Spaniards, Manila was made the capital of the Spanish settlement in Asia due to the city&#x27;s commercial wealth and influence, its strategic location, and Spanish fears of raids from the Portuguese and the Dutch. 

The first dictionary of Tagalog, published as the , was written by the Franciscan Pedro de San Buenaventura, and published in 1613 by the &quot;Father of Filipino Printing&quot; Tomás Pinpin in Pila, Laguna. A latter book of the same name was written by Czech Jesuit missionary Paul Klein (known locally as Pablo Clain) at the beginning of the 18th century. Klein spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books. He wrote a dictionary, which he later passed to Francisco Jansens and José Hernández. Further compilation of his substantial work was prepared by Juan de Noceda and Pedro de Sanlúcar and published as &quot;&quot; in Manila in 1754 and then repeatedly re-edited, with the latest edition being published in 2013 in Manila.

Spanish served in an official capacity as language of the government during the Spanish period. Spanish played a significant role in unifying the Philippines, a country made up of over 7,000 islands with a multitude of ethnicities, languages, and cultures. Before Spanish rule, the archipelago was not a unified nation, but rather a collection of independent kingdoms, sultanates, and tribes, each with its own language and customs. During the American colonial period, English became an additional official language of the Philippines alongside Spanish; however, the number of speakers of Spanish steadily decreased. The United States initiated policies that led to the gradual removal of Spanish from official use in the Philippines. This was not done through an outright ban, but rather through a strategic shift in language policy that promoted English as the primary language for education, governance, and law. Spanish was designated an optional and voluntary language under the 1987 Constitution, along with Arabic.

==Designation as the national language==
While Spanish and English were considered &quot;official languages&quot; during the American colonial period, there existed no &quot;national language&quot; initially. Article XIII, section 3 of the 1935 constitution establishing the Commonwealth of the Philippines provided that:
On November 13, 1936, the first National Assembly of the Philippine Commonwealth approved Commonwealth Act No. 184; creating the Institute of National Language (later the Surián ng Wikang Pambansâ or SWP) and tasking it with making a study and survey of each existing native language, hoping to choose which was to be the base for a standardized national language. Later, President Manuel L. Quezon later appointed representatives for each major regional language to form the NLI. Led by Jaime C. De Veyra, who sat as the chair of the Institute and as the representative of Samar-Leyte-Visayans, the Institute&#x27;s members were composed of Santiago A. Fonacier (representing the Ilokano-speaking regions), Filemon Sotto (the Cebu-Visayans), Casimiro Perfecto (the Bikolanos), Felix S. Sales Rodriguez (the Panay-Visayans), Hadji Butu (the languages of Muslim Filipinos), and Cecilio Lopez (the Tagalogs).

The Institute of National Language adopted a resolution on November 9, 1937 recommending Tagalog to be basis of the national language. On December 30, President Quezon issued Executive Order No. 134, s. 1937, approving the adoption of Tagalog as the language of the Philippines, and proclaimed the national language of the Philippines so based on the Tagalog language. Quezon himself was born and raised in Baler, Aurora, which is a native Tagalog-speaking area. The order stated that it would take effect two years from its promulgation. On December 31 of the same year, Quezon proclaimed Tagalog as the basis of the &quot;Wikang Pambansâ&quot; (National Language) giving the following factors:
#Tagalog is widely spoken and is the most understood language in all the Philippine Regions.
#It is not divided into smaller daughter languages, as Visayan or Bikol are.
#Its literary tradition is the richest of all Philippine languages, the most developed and extensive (mirroring that of the Tuscan language &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; Italian). From at least before 1935, more books were written in Tagalog than in any other Philippine language.
#Tagalog has always been the language of Manila, the political centre of the Philippines in much of its history as a multiethnic country and a considerable economic centre of the Philippine islands since time immemorial.
#The Katipunan generally used the Tagalog language for its operations, and the Philippine Revolution and the First Philippine Republic operationally used Spanish afterwards, but many of the leaders of the revolution spoke Tagalog, more so among ethnic groups from central to southern Luzon including some adjacent islands. Tagalog also became a choice for some non-Tagalog Filipino revolutionary leaders and nationalists in some of their publications, especially if they were to publish in Manila. The Katipunan extended the meaning of the term Tagalog to all people native to the Philippine islands, including Cebuanos, Ilocanos, Kapampangans, etc, and extended the term &quot;Katagalugan&quot; to the whole Philippine islands not just native Tagalog-speaking areas, building a Tagalog Republic, the reason being a unified opposition against Spanish hegemony.

On June 7, 1940, the Philippine National Assembly passed Commonwealth Act No. 570 declaring that the Filipino national language would be considered an official language effective July 4, 1946 (coinciding with the country&#x27;s expected date of independence from the United States). That same year, the &quot;Balarílà ng Wikang Pambansâ&quot; () of grammarian Lope K. Santos introduced the 20-letter Abakada alphabet which became the standard of the national language. The alphabet was officially adopted by the Institute for the Tagalog-Based National Language.

== Further history ==
In 1959, the language became known as &quot;Pilipino&quot; in an effort to disassociate it from the Tagalog ethnic group. The changing of the name did not, however, result in universal acceptance among non-Tagalogs, especially Cebuanos who had previously not accepted the 1937 selection.

The 1960s saw the rise of the purist movement where new words were being coined to replace loanwords. This era of &quot;purism&quot; by the SWP sparked criticisms by a number of persons. Two counter-movements emerged during this period of &quot;purism&quot;: one campaigning against Tagalog and the other campaigning for more inclusiveness in the national language. In 1963, Negros Occidental congressman Innocencio V. Ferrer took a case reaching the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the choice of Tagalog as the basis of the national language (a case ruled in favor of the national language in 1970). Accusing the national language as simply being Tagalog and lacking any substantial input from other Philippine languages, Congressman Geruncio Lacuesta eventually led a &quot;Modernizing the Language Approach Movement&quot; (MOLAM). Lacuesta hosted a number of &quot;anti-purist&quot; conferences and promoted a &quot;Manila Lingua Franca&quot; which would be more inclusive of loanwords of both foreign and local languages. Lacuesta managed to get nine congressmen to propose a bill aiming to abolish the SWP with an &quot;Akademia ng Wikang Filipino&quot;, to replace the &quot;balarila&quot; with a &quot;Gramatica ng Wikang Filipino&quot;, to replace the 20-letter Abakada with a 32-letter alphabet, and to prohibit the creation of neologisms and the respelling of loanwords. This movement quietened down following the death of Lacuesta.

The national language issue was revived once more during the 1971 Constitutional Convention. While there was a sizable number of delegates in favor of retaining the Tagalog-based national language, majority of the delegates who were non-Tagalogs were even in favor of scrapping the idea of a &quot;national language&quot; altogether. A compromise was reached and the wording on the 1973 constitution made no mention of dropping the national language Pilipino or made any mention of Tagalog. Instead, the 1973 Constitution, in both its original form and as amended in 1976, designated English and Pilipino as official languages and provided for development and formal adoption of a common national language, termed &quot;Filipino&quot;, to replace Pilipino. Neither the original nor the amended version specified either Tagalog or Pilipino as the basis for Filipino; Instead, tasking the National Assembly to:

In 1987, a new constitution designated Filipino as the national language and, along with English, as an official language. That constitution included several provisions related to the Filipino language.

Article XIV, Section 6, omits any mention of Tagalog as the basis for Filipino, and states that:

And also states in the article:
and:
Section 17(d) of Executive Order 117 of January 30, 1987 renamed the &quot;Institute of National Language&quot; as &quot;Institute of Philippine Languages&quot;. Republic Act No. 7104, approved on August 14, 1991, created the (Commission on the Filipino Language, or KWF), superseding the Institute of Philippine Languages. The KWF reports directly to the President and was tasked to undertake, coordinate and promote researches for the development, propagation and preservation of Filipino and other Philippine languages. On May 13, 1992, the commission issued Resolution 92-1, specifying that Filipino is the

However, as with the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions, 92-1 went neither so far as to categorically identify, nor so far as to dis-identify this language as Tagalog. Definite, absolute, and unambiguous interpretation of 92–1 is the prerogative of the Supreme Court in the absence of directives from the KWF, otherwise the sole legal arbiter of the Filipino language.

Filipino was presented and registered with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), by Ateneo de Manila University student Martin Gomez, and was added to the ISO registry of languages on September 21, 2004, with it receiving the ISO 639-2 code &quot;fil&quot;.

On August 22, 2007, it was reported that three Malolos City regional trial courts in Bulacan decided to use Filipino, instead of English, in order to promote the national language. Twelve stenographers from Branches 6, 80 and 81, as model courts, had undergone training at Marcelo H. del Pilar College of Law of Bulacan State University following a directive from the Supreme Court of the Philippines. De la Rama said it was the dream of Chief Justice Reynato Puno to implement the program in other areas such as Laguna, Cavite, Quezon, Aurora, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Rizal, and Metro Manila, all of which mentioned are natively Tagalog-speaking.

==Commemoration==
Since 1997, a month-long celebration of the national language occurs during August, known in Filipino as &quot;Buwan ng Wika&quot; (Language Month). Previously, this lasted only a week and was known as &quot;Linggo ng Wika&quot; (Language Week). The celebration coincides with the month of birth of President Manuel L. Quezon, regarded as the &quot;Ama ng Wikang Pambansa&quot; (Father of the national language).

In 1946, Proclamation No. 35 of March 26 provided for a week-long celebration of the national language. this celebration would last from March 27 until April 2 each year, the last day coinciding with birthday of the Filipino writer Francisco Baltazar, author of the Tagalog epic &quot;Florante at Laura&quot;.

In 1954, Proclamation No. 12 of March 26 provided that the week of celebration would be from March 29 to April 4 every year. This proclamation was amended the following year by President Ramon Magsaysay by Proclamation No. 186 of September 23, moving the dates of celebration to August 13–19, every year. Now coinciding with the birthday of President Manuel L. Quezon. The reason for the move being given that the original celebration was a period &quot;outside of the school year, thereby precluding the participation of schools in its celebration&quot;.

In 1988, President Corazon Aquino signed Proclamation No. 19, reaffirming the celebration every August 13 to 19. In 1997, the celebration was extended from a week to a month by Proclamation 1041 of July 15 signed by President Fidel V. Ramos.

==Comparison of Filipino and Tagalog ==
It is argued that current state of the Filipino language is contrary to the intention of Republic Act (RA) No. 7104 that requires that the national language be developed and enriched by the lexicon of the country&#x27;s other languages.

It is further argued that, while the official view (shared by the government, the , and a number of educators) is that Filipino and Tagalog are considered separate languages, in practical terms, &quot;Filipino&quot; may be considered the official name of Tagalog, or even a synonym of it. Today&#x27;s Filipino language is best described as &quot;Tagalog-based&quot;. The language is usually called &quot;Tagalog&quot; within the Philippines and among Filipinos to differentiate it from other Philippine languages, but it has also come to be known as &quot;Filipino&quot; to differentiate it from the languages of other countries; the former implies a regional origin, the latter national. This is similar to the comparison between Castilian and Spanish, or Mandarin and Chinese.

Political designations aside, Tagalog and Filipino are linguistically the same, sharing, among other things, the same grammatical structure. On May 23, 2007, Ricardo Maria Nolasco, KWF chair and a linguistics expert, acknowledged in a keynote speech during the NAKEM Conference at the Mariano Marcos State University in Batac, Ilocos Norte, that Filipino was simply Tagalog in syntax and grammar, with as yet no grammatical element or lexicon coming from Ilokano, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, or any of the other Philippine languages. He said further that this is contrary to the intention of Republic Act No. 7104, which requires that the national language be developed and enriched by the lexicon of the country&#x27;s other languages, something toward which the commission was working. On August 24, 2007, Nolasco elaborated further on the relationship between Tagalog and Filipino in a separate article, as follows:

In connection with the use of Filipino, or specifically the promotion of the national language, the related term &quot;Tagalista&quot; is frequently used. While the word &quot;Tagalista&quot; literally means &quot;one who specializes in Tagalog language or culture&quot; or a &quot;Tagalog specialist&quot;, in the context of the debates on the national language and &quot;Imperial Manila&quot;, the word &quot;Tagalista&quot; is used as a reference to &quot;people who promote or would promote the primacy of Tagalog at the expense of [the] other [Philippine] indigenous tongues&quot;.

==Example==
This is a translation of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Usually, the diacritics are not written, and the syntax and grammar are based on that of Tagalog.

<doc id="236491" wikidata="Q281476" url="?curid=236491" title="USS Hawaii (CB-3)">
<text>USS &quot;Hawaii&quot; (CB-3) was intended to be the third member of the large cruisers. It was the first United States Navy ship to be named after the then-Territory of Hawaii. Because &quot;Hawaii&quot;″s construction was delayed by higher-priority ships like aircraft carriers, her keel was not laid until December 1943, about two years after her sister ship .

&quot;Hawaii&quot; was launched in late 1945, but post-war budget cutbacks necessitated her cancellation in 1947. The &quot;Alaska&quot;-class large cruisers were seen as requiring a crew almost as large as a or , while the armor and protection of the capital ship-sized &quot;Hawaii&quot; was no better than a and this was particularly significant as the underwater protection designed into &quot;Hawaii&quot; was poor. In a famous &quot;Proceedings&quot; article in January 1949, Frank Uhlig dismissed the performance of the class in 1944–1945 and concluded the battlecruiser had no place in the postwar USN. For a time, the US Navy planned to convert the ship into the US&#x27; first guided missile cruiser, but this did not come to fruition. A conversion to a large command ship was later contemplated and planning went far enough that money was allocated in the 1952 budget for this purpose. However, with one command ship already completed, , and a second already chosen, , no work was started upon &quot;Hawaii&quot;. Having been laid up for twelve years, the still incomplete ship was towed to breakers to be scrapped in 1959.

== Design and description==

The initial impetus for the design of the &quot;Alaska&quot; class came from the commerce-raiding abilities of German and Japanese ships; the three s, the two s and Japan&#x27;s large force of both heavy and light cruisers. By the time that they were built, their role had expanded to protect carrier groups. It was thought that the class&#x27;s bigger guns, greater size and higher speed would give them a marked advantage in this role over heavy cruisers and they would also provide insurance against reports that Japan was building &quot;super cruisers&quot; more powerful than American cruisers limited by the London Naval Treaty.

&quot;Hawaii&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at deep load. The ship was powered by four General Electric geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller and eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers rated at and a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried four floatplanes, housed in two hangars, with a pair of aircraft catapults mounted amidships.

The ship was armed with a main battery of nine 12 inch (305 mm) L/50 Mark 8 guns in three triple-gun turrets, two in a superfiring pair forward and one aft of the superstructure. The secondary battery consisted of twelve 5-inch (127 mm) L/38 dual-purpose guns in six twin turrets. Two were placed on the centerline superfiring over the main battery turrets, fore and aft; the remaining four turrets were placed on the corners of the superstructure. The light anti-aircraft battery consisted of 56 quad-mounted Bofors guns and 34 single-mounted Oerlikon guns. A pair of Mk 34 gun directors aided gunlaying for the main battery, while two Mk 37 directors controlled the 5-inch guns and a Mk 57 director aided the 40 mm guns. The main armored belt was thick, while the gun turrets had thick faces. The main armored deck was thick.

== Construction, conversion proposals and eventual fate ==
Along with the five s and the final three &quot;Alaska&quot;-class cruisers, the construction of &quot;Hawaii&quot; was suspended in May 1942 before work began. This freed materials and facilities so that they could be used to build additional ships which could be completed faster and were needed in the war zones, like anti-submarine escorts. Over of steel plates and shapes which had been destined for &quot;Hawaii&quot; was redirected to other ships in July 1942. However, &quot;Hawaii&quot; was added back onto the construction queue on 25 May 1943, unlike CB-4 through CB-6, which were cancelled on 24 June 1943. Her keel was laid on 20 December 1943, and she was finally launched on 3 November 1945, about two years after &quot;Guam&quot;. The ship was sponsored by Mary P. Farrington, the wife of the delegate from the Territory of Hawaii to the United States House of Representatives, Joseph Farrington. After her launch, little, if any, work was done before construction was halted in either February or April 1947 due to the reduction in defense expenditures after World War II; the ship was 82.4% complete when work was halted. The turrets for the main battery had been fitted and the superstructure was mostly finished, although the former were removed when the ship was moved into the reserve fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

=== Aircraft carrier conversion ===
&quot;Hawaii&quot; was considered under project SCB 26 for a conversion to an aircraft carrier, with an aircraft crane and twin aircraft catapults to be added on the stern of the ship. The conversion, as envisioned, would have looked similar to a completed . The ship would have also been able to launch the JB-2 &quot;Loon&quot; cruise missile from a hydraulic catapult installed on her forward flight deck. The conversion was authorized in the same year (1948) and was scheduled to be completed in 1950; the ship&#x27;s classification was changed to CBG-3 to reflect the planned overhaul. However, the conversion was canceled in 1949, along with any other plans for surface ships equipped with ballistic missiles, due to the volatility of the rocket fuels and the shortcomings with guidance systems that were available.

=== Guided-missile cruiser designs ===
Similar to the unfinished battleship , &quot;Hawaii&quot; was considered for a conversion to be a test platform for the development of guided missiles in September 1946. Designated CB(SW), the cruisers&#x27; gun armament would have consisted of sixteen 3-inch (76 mm) L70 guns in eight dual mounts. Most missiles would have been mounted toward the bow, while two &quot;missile launching pits&quot; would be located near the stern. For this task, no armor would have been needed and previously installed armor was to be taken off the ship when required. These plans never came to fruition, so &quot;Hawaii&quot; remained in the Reserve Fleet, still incomplete.

Two years later, in 1948, a similar conversion plan was put forth. This plan, designated project SCB 26A, proposed that &quot;Hawaii&quot; be converted into a Ballistic Guided Missile Ship. This plan called for &quot;Hawaii&quot; to be completed with 12 vertical launchers for U.S.-made V-2 short-range ballistic missiles and 6 launchers for the SSM-N-2 Triton surface-to-surface cruise missile. Triton was an attempt to give the Navy a reliable cruise missile that it could launch off of its ships. The design process began with an approval from the U.S. Navy in September 1946. After &quot;formulating performance objectives and possible design baselines&quot;, the designers settled on attempting to fit a ramjet-powered cruiser missile onto solid-fuel rocket boosters that could carry the missile at Mach 1.6–2.5 in 1950. After lowering the ambitious goals to more realistic levels in 1955, a fully operational version was expected by 1965, but with tests for the SSM-N-9/RGM-15 Regulus II planned for that year and the up-and-coming UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched cruise missile, the project was terminated in 1957. One source has a variation of this scheme, with the developmental XPM (Experimental Prototype Missile) from Operation Bumblebee replacing the Triton launchers. XPM eventually led to the RIM-8 Talos surface-to-air missile.

=== Large command ship ===

Yet another conversion of &quot;Hawaii&quot;, this time to a &quot;large command ship&quot;, was contemplated under project SCB 83 from August 1951. In this role, she would have been similar to , but larger. This conversion would have boasted expansive flag facilities and fully capable radar and communication systems for commanding carrier task forces, though there would have been no facilities for amphibious operations. Armament would have consisted of sixteen 5&quot;/54-caliber guns in single mounts; this gun size was specified because 3-inch/50-caliber guns were believed to be too light. Two radars would have been mounted: an AN/SPS-2 on top of a forward tower and an AN/SPS-8 on the aft superstructure. In addition, an SC-2 was to be mounted on top of a short tower aft of the stack (though forward of the SPS-8); this would have been used for &quot;tropospheric scatter communications&quot;.

Two Mk37/25 fire-control directors were planned, both fore and aft of the superstructure. The conversion plans were authorized, and her classification was changed to CBC-1 to reflect this on 26 February 1952. Money to begin the project was included in the 1952 budget, but the only work done on the ship was the removal of the 12&quot; turrets, as it was intended that experience from &quot;Northampton&quot; should be analyzed before a full conversion. However, when it was seen that a smaller and cheaper ship—like the light carrier —could do the same duty, the &quot;Hawaii&quot; project was cancelled in 1953. She reverted to her original designation of CB-3 on 9 September 1954.

===Polaris study===
In February 1957, a study entitled &quot;Polaris Study–CB-3&quot; was published, proposing that &quot;Hawaii&quot; be stripped of all her guns in favor of twenty Polaris missiles, mounted in the hull vertically in roughly the same location as the third main turret would have been located, two Talos surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers, one each fore and aft, two Tartar SAMs mounted on either side of the superstructure and a single ASROC anti-submarine weapon mounted where the second main turret would have been placed. Nothing further was done with the study.

===Disposal===
On 9 June 1958, &quot;Hawaii&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register and the ship was sold to the Boston Metals Company of Baltimore on 15 April 1959. The still-incomplete &quot;Hawaii&quot; was towed to Baltimore, arriving there on 6 January 1960 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.

<text>Knighty Knight Bugs is a 1958 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on August 23, 1958, and stars Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam.

&quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot; is the only Bugs Bunny cartoon to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, which was awarded in 1959. The short was later included in the 1981 compilation film &quot;The Looney, Looney, Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot;. The cartoon&#x27;s title is a pun on the phrase &quot;Nighty Night&quot;.

==Plot==

In the realm of King Arthur, trouble ensues when the Singing Sword is stolen by the infamous Black Knight Yosemite Sam. King Arthur, along with his loyal Knights of the Round Table, seeks a volunteer to recover the stolen artifact. Reluctantly, court jester Bugs Bunny is assigned the mission by King Arthur, facing considerable consequences if he fails.

Upon infiltrating the castle of the Black Knight, Bugs encounters a dragon, companion to Yosemite Sam, suffering from a cold-induced sneezing fit. Taking advantage of the situation, Bugs retrieves the Singing Sword from the castle&#x27;s chest. When Bugs wonders aloud why it is called the Singing Sword, it starts humming &quot;Cuddle up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine&quot; and causes Sam to wake up from his nap. As Bugs escapes, Yosemite Sam gives chase on the dragon, leading to a series of comical encounters. Bugs outsmarts Yosemite Sam by utilizing the castle&#x27;s defenses against him, causing various mishaps including Sam falling into the moat and being flattened by a failed catapult launch. Despite Sam&#x27;s persistent pursuit, Bugs ultimately traps him and the dragon in an explosives stockade within the castle.

As Bugs departs with the Singing Sword, the dragon&#x27;s sneeze triggers an explosion that propels Sam and the dragon towards the moon. Bugs bids them farewell as the Singing Sword plays &quot;Aloha &#x27;Oe&quot; at the end.

==Awards==
&quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot; is the fifth &quot;Merrie Melodies/Looney Tunes&quot; entry to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1959. In doing so, it beat out cartoons Walt Disney Studios&#x27; &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot; and Terrytoons&#x27; &quot;Sidney&#x27;s Family Tree&quot;. It was the third Oscar-nominated Bugs Bunny cartoon, after &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; in 1941 and &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Rabbit Hunt&quot; in 1942. The Oscar was presented to John W. Burton, the producer of this cartoon. After Burton&#x27;s death, the Oscar was handed to the director, Friz Freleng.

In the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Who Bopped Bugs Bunny?&quot;, the Oscar win of &quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot; is a major plot point. Mirroring the real-life loss of the Terrytoons short at the Academy Awards, a character named Sappy &quot;Slaphappy&quot; Stanley (a parody of &quot;Silly&quot; Sidney, here voiced by Jonathan Winters) was defeated for the Shloscar Award. As a result, Stanley scorned the U.S. film industry and relocated to France, where despite becoming a national star still nursed a bitter grudge against Bugs, culminating in the episode&#x27;s plot.

<doc id="236502" wikidata="Q5595658" url="?curid=236502" title="Grange Hill">
<text>Grange Hill is a British children&#x27;s television drama series, originally produced by the BBC and portraying life in a typical comprehensive school. The show began its run on 8 February 1978 on BBC1, and was one of the longest-running programmes on British television when it ended on 15 September 2008 after 31 series. It was created by Phil Redmond, who is also responsible for the Channel 4 dramas &quot;Brookside&quot; and &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;; other notable production team members down the years have included producer Colin Cant and script editor Anthony Minghella.

The show was cancelled in 2008, having run every year for 30 years. It was felt by the BBC that the series had run its course.

== Overview ==

The drama was centred on the fictional comprehensive school of Grange Hill in the equally fictitious North London borough of Northam. As well as dealing with school-related issues such as bullying, learning difficulties, teacher-pupil relationships and conflicts, &quot;Grange Hill&quot; &quot;broke new ground over the years, with the kind of hard-hitting storylines not usually seen in children&#x27;s dramas&quot;, such as racism, drugs (e.g. Zammo McGuire&#x27;s heroin addiction, LSD), teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, homosexuality, knife crime, homelessness, rape/sexual assault, mental illness (e.g. bipolar disorder), divorce, cancer (e.g. leukaemia), gun crime, child abuse, alcoholism and death. The early years also saw as at the time of its original broadcast the practice was still legal both directly and indirectly the use of corporal punishment as a form of maintaining discipline (corporal punishment was banned in all state schools in the United Kingdom in 1987). The series was originally to have been called &quot;Grange Park&quot;, which would go on to be used as the name of the school in another Redmond creation, the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; (1982–2003). Grange Park is an area of St. Helens, Merseyside, where Redmond once lived.

== Series history ==
&quot;Grange Hill&quot; was originally conceived by ATV writer Phil Redmond, who first approached various television companies with the idea in 1975, unsuccessfully. In 1976, he managed to sell the idea to the BBC, and the children&#x27;s drama executive Anna Home commissioned an initial series of nine episodes in a trial run, the first being broadcast on 8 February 1978.

From the start, the series sparked controversy over its realistic, gritty portrayal of school life, which differed from the idealised portrayals of earlier school dramas. Redmond has said that he was not fully able to start pushing the boundaries until later series. This led to Redmond being summoned to lunch by BBC bosses and forced to agree that there would be no further series unless he toned certain elements down. &quot;Grange Hill&quot;&#x27;s highest-profile period was undoubtedly the mid- to late 1980s. One of the most famous storylines during this time was that of Zammo McGuire (played by Lee MacDonald) and his addiction to heroin. This storyline ran over two series (1986–87) and focused on Zammo&#x27;s descent into drugs and how it strained his relationship with girlfriend Jackie and friend Kevin. Among the show&#x27;s other favourite characters during this period were Gonch and Hollo, played by John Holmes (also credited as John McMahon) and Bradley Sheppard. During his time at the school (1985–89) Gonch took part in many moneymaking schemes, most of which were unsuccessful. There was a comedic element to the duo&#x27;s relationship that worked well with viewers. Script editor Anthony Minghella, who worked on the series for several years during the 1980s, later won an Academy Award for Best Director for the film &quot;The English Patient&quot; in 1996.

During the 1990s, &quot;Grange Hill&quot; did not receive the same media attention that it had had just a few years before. The teachers were now equals in the narrative, with their personal lives taking up almost as much time as those of the pupils. In 1994, two characters were introduced with disabilities: Denny Roberts (Lisa Hammond), who had dwarfism, and Rachel Burns (Francesca Martinez), who had cerebral palsy. Both characters were presented as &quot;one of the gang&quot; and hated being accorded any special treatment because of their circumstances. This prompted the BFI&#x27;s 2002 publication &quot;The Hill And Beyond&quot; to comment that &quot;Grange Hill&quot; had perhaps become politically correct.

Beginning on 4 April 1993, in celebration of the programme&#x27;s 15th anniversary, the first fifteen series of &quot;Grange Hill&quot; were repeated during Children&#x27;s BBC&#x27;s Sunday (and later, Saturday) morning slots on BBC1 and BBC2. The repeats ended with Series 16 in 1999. In the 1990s &quot;Grange Hill&quot; was repeated in full on digital satellite and cable channel UK Gold, which broadcast the late 1970s and early 80s episodes of the show. In 1998, it reappeared on sister channel UK Gold Classics, which was a digital-only channel showing programmes previously aired on UK Gold, and &quot;Grange Hill&quot; was part of its schedule. The channel lasted only six months, however, before becoming UK Gold 2 in April 1999. Interest in &quot;Grange Hill&quot; was renewed in the late 1990s and the series celebrated its 20th anniversary with the introduction of sinister Scottish bully Sean Pearce (Iain Robertson), who carried a knife and slashed the face of a classmate. Cast member Laura Sadler, who was heavily involved in this storyline, died after falling out of a building in June 2003; four years earlier her &quot;Grange Hill&quot; character Judi Jeffreys had been killed after slipping and falling out of the window of a burning storeroom in the school.

By 2001, the series was almost entirely issue-led and the decision to tackle the subject of rape upset some parents. But when Phil Redmond took over production of &quot;Grange Hill&quot; in 2003, his plan was to get the show back to its roots and the issues were toned down as Redmond skewed the show towards a younger audience.

&quot;Grange Hill&quot; returned on 14 April 2008 with its final series, including a return of the original theme music. Series 31 returned to BBC1 after the 2007 series was shown exclusively on the CBBC Channel.

In 2019, Redmond spoke about possibly reviving the show and dealing with current social issues.

== Film ==

In early 2006, it was announced that a film of &quot;Grange Hill&quot; was to be released in late 2007 focusing on the lives of former pupils. There was silence on the project for 15 years, until it was announced in January 2022 that Redmond had written the script and was looking to start casting.

== Production history ==
For its first 25 years Grange Hill was produced in-house by the BBC, then the show was made independently for the corporation by Mersey TV, the production house founded by Redmond (and later renamed as Lime Pictures), hence the reason for the production move.

=== Television Centre years: 1978–1985 ===
Location external and some interior scenes in &quot;Grange Hill&quot; were originally filmed at real schools in London. The first of these was Kingsbury High School in North West London, which was used as the &quot;Grange Hill&quot; setting for the first two series. For series 3 (1980) exterior filming moved to Willesden High School (now Capital City Academy) in Willesden Green, which was similar in looks to Kingsbury, and was also situated in a residential area of the capital. In 1981, &quot;Grange Hill&quot; moved to Holborn College (now Fulham Preparatory School) in Greyhound Road, Hammersmith. This school looked very different from the two that had been used previously, and it was also in a built-up area of London. Holborn College was the longest serving of the &quot;real schools&quot;, remaining on screen until 1985. Up to and including 1985, interior scenes were shot at the BBC Television Centre in London.

=== Elstree years: 1985–2002 ===
In 1985, production shifted to the former ATV studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The BBC had purchased the studio complex the previous year. The studios, now known as BBC Elstree Centre, were the location for some exterior filming from Series 8 on the closed Elstree set. A 1960s office block, Neptune House in the facility now doubled as &quot;Hill&quot;″s &quot;lower school&quot;.

The change was explained on screen with an elaborate storyline whereby Grange Hill merged with rival schools Brookdale and Rodney Bennett to form a new school, Grange Hill. In Series 8 the merger had taken place and Grange Hill operated as a split-site school; the former Rodney Bennett building (Neptune House) being the lower school and the original Grange Hill building (still Holborn College) the upper school.

In series 9, the Upper School building was condemned after a fire, allowing production of &quot;Grange Hill&quot; to fully move to Elstree including studio work. &quot;Grange Hill&quot; was, at this time, made as an outside broadcast in the same way as its stablemate, &quot;EastEnders&quot;. New producer Diana Kyle switched filming to a single camera format from 1999 onwards.

In 1990, Neptune House was replaced with a different building on the same site. This building remained in use until 2002, with cosmetic modifications along the way. However, as the 1990s progressed more use was made of real schools including the Nicholas Hawksmoor School and Bushey Meads School, and St Audrey&#x27;s School in Hatfield.

=== Liverpool years: 2003–2008 ===
Early in 2002, it was announced that &quot;Grange Hill&quot; creator Phil Redmond had signed a deal for his production company Mersey TV to produce the next three series of the programme. Production moved to Mersey TV&#x27;s studios in Childwall, Liverpool from Series 26 onwards and for the first time in some years the appearance of Grange Hill School itself would change radically. On screen an explosion ripped through the school at the end of Series 25; during Series 26 tarpaulins covered most of the new &quot;school&quot; to mask the &quot;fire damage&quot;.

Phil Redmond originally wanted children from all over the country to participate in the relaunched &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, having a variety of regional accents in the series as opposed to just the London area voices which had become associated with the programme; however, almost all new characters were exclusively cast from the north-west of England due to the logistics of the child employment laws.

Real schools in the locality were also used including Croxteth Comprehensive, Holly Lodge Girls&#x27; School and St Hilda&#x27;s C of E High School in Liverpool. In 2005, the former Brookside Parade set at Mersey TV was redeveloped to benefit &quot;Grange Hill&quot; and the new &quot;Creative Learning Centre&quot; subsequently became an integral part of the show. After &quot;Grange Hill&quot; ended in 2008, the CLC exterior set has now been turned into a skateboard park set for &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; while the former Grange Hill school frontage has become a permanent exterior for Hollyoaks High.

==== &quot;The Grange&quot; ====
In 2007, BBC Children&#x27;s ordered major changes to &quot;Grange Hill&quot; so that it fitted in with the new requirement that all programmes under the CBBC banner must appeal to an audience age 12 and under – younger than the traditional age group for &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, which was the same as or slightly younger than the secondary school characters. Under a deal signed in 2005, Lime Pictures was contracted to produce &quot;Grange Hill&quot; until 2008, so changes began to be made.

For series 31 (the final series produced), Lime Pictures creative director Tony Wood set about the task of meeting CBBC&#x27;s new requirements. He shifted much of the action away from general school life to &quot;The Grange&quot;, the school&#x27;s multimedia learning centre, which was given a radical makeover and became as much a &quot;hang out&quot; as a learning resource. The emphasis was now on younger characters with a group of Year 6 pupils regularly coming to use The Grange from primary school; storylines were much lighter and fantasy sequences were introduced. One episode, &quot;Boarderman&quot;, saw a Year 7 pupil become a masked skateboarding superhero campaigning for an end to the school&#x27;s ban on skateboarding. In another, &quot;Veggin&#x27; out&quot;, a girl and her classmates smuggled animals from a local petting farm into school, believing they were destined for slaughter.

&quot;The Observer&quot; reported on 13 January 2008 that the BBC&#x27;s intention was to shift the action away from Grange Hill School and into The Grange completely. Phil Redmond responded in the same article by calling for &quot;Grange Hill&quot; to be scrapped, saying the programme had been &quot;robbed of its original purpose&quot;. Redmond had been planning a hard-hitting storyline to return &quot;Grange Hill&quot; to its gritty origins in series 31, and although he signed off the changes he believed it wasn&#x27;t his show any more.

==== Cancellation ====
On 6 February 2008, the BBC announced &quot;Grange Hill&quot; was to be axed after exactly 30 years. The announcement was made by CBBC controller Anne Gilchrist just two days before the show&#x27;s official 30th birthday. &quot;Grange Hill&quot; ended on Monday 15 September 2008.

In 2006, the BBC had announced big plans for the show&#x27;s 30th birthday including special programming on BBC2, possible repeats and a lavish reunion of former stars during 2008. But in the event, none of these celebrations happened aside from a special BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Grange Hill: Soap Pioneer&quot;, hosted by fan and comedian Robin Ince, broadcast on 4 September 2008. The last episode of &quot;Grange Hill&quot; was watched by 500,000 viewers.

Seven months later, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; paid homage to the series in its episode 2.1 (airing 20 April 2009). In that episode, the time-travelling protagonist, DI Alex Drake, sees her daughter Molly incorporated into an episode of &quot;Grange Hill&quot; on the evening of 3 or 5 April 1982 [calendar indicates 3 April; the news report was from 5 April]. Molly (in new footage) tells headmistress Bridget McClusky (appearing as archival footage and Gwyneth Powell&#x27;s newly recorded audio) that she and Tucker got into a fight when Tucker said her mother Alex was dead.

== Spin-offs and merchandise ==
The show spawned a spin-off called &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1983–1985), which ran for three series starring Todd Carty. The three series saw the two lead characters (Tucker and Alan) finding work. The 1986 cast released &quot;Grange Hill: The Album&quot;, with two singles: &quot;Just Say No&quot; (tying in with a character&#x27;s heroin addiction) and &quot;You Know the Teacher (Smash Head)&quot;. The album was re-released on CD on 12 November 2007, as part of the BBC&#x27;s 30th Anniversary celebrations.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1988, a documentary titled &quot;Behind The Scenes...At Grange Hill&quot; aired, presented by Lee MacDonald. The documentary featured: auditions, rehearsals and filming for series 11, the child actors&#x27; opinions on being tutored and chaperoned and what impact being in &quot;Grange Hill&quot; had on their schooling, as well as dealing with fame.

In 1989, a musical play titled &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Return&quot; based on the series was staged at Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch. Starring Todd Carty who, as Tucker, now returned to Grange Hill as a PE teacher, it also featured several stars of the show both from Tucker&#x27;s original run, and of the then-current series circa 1989.

In 2005, Justin Lee Collins reunited some of the cast members from the 1980s in the documentary &quot;Bring Back...Grange Hill&quot;.

== Title sequence and theme music ==

From the start of the series in Series 1 (1978) to Series 10 (1987), the title sequence was in a comic book style and used &quot;Chicken Man&quot; by Alan Hawkshaw as the theme tune.

From Series 11 (1988) to Series 12 (1989), a new title sequence was introduced, now using still images of certain topics, along with a bassier rendition of Chicken Man. 

From Series 13 (1990) to Series 16 (1993), a new title sequence was introduced which showed pupils and staff travelling into school in a slightly grainy CCTV style. This was accompanied by a new, more contemporary-sounding theme written for the series by Peter Moss.

From Series 17 (1994) to Series 23 (2000), new titles were introduced showing pupils taking part various school subjects such as music, chemistry, PE and Food Technology.

From Series 24 (2001) to Series 25 (2002), a more colourful sequence was introduced, showing pupils interacting with the logo itself. This was due to Grange Hill being broadcast in widescreen for the first time, the opening theme had been cut slightly shorter for the first time since 1990.

Only used for Series 26 (2003), the titles once again changed, this was to reflect on the move to Liverpool as the previous titles featured shots of the old school building (based In Elstree), once again the titles &amp; the theme tune had been shortened down.

From Series 27 (2004) to Series 30 (2007), the titles changed once again. These were in the style of a video game, and the Moss theme tune had been edited down to around 12 seconds by this point. This was the first time since 1989 that live action footage was not used.

For the 30th anniversary in Series 31 (2008), and what turned out to be the final series, an abbreviated edit of the original version of &quot;Chicken Man&quot; was reinstated as the main theme, and, for the final time, the titles had changed once again for cartoon pupils and staff experiencing topics discussed in older series&#x27; of Grange Hill. 

&quot;Grange Hill&quot; was the first programme to use it as a theme followed by the popular quiz show &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot;, whose makers used it from 1979 to 1982, despite it already being played on &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; used a less dynamic custom arrangement more in keeping with the style of light entertainment programming.

The last four notes of the original theme song were heard when &quot;Brookside&quot;, one of Phil Redmond&#x27;s other TV series, aired its final episode in November 2003.

From 1978 to 1993, the end music would change length and notes occasionally depending on how many actors were in the episode and the mood/theme of the episode. For example, a longer version of the end music would be used if more actors played a role or if the episode focused on a serious tone. 

From 1978 to 1984, the ending credits would be on a plain background in either black or blue.

From 1985 to 1989, the ending credits would play over various shots of the episode it showed.

From 1990 to 2008, the ending credits would be on a custom-made background that either shows the Grange Hill logo, or it would be related to the intro used during the time.

== Head teachers ==

Mr Starling appeared only once during Series One, and his initial, E., was shown underneath the name of the school in the first episode: the authority figure most regularly seen during this time was the Head of First Year, Mrs Monroe (Dorothea Philips). Mr Llewellyn did not appear on screen during the 1980 series: the day-to-day running of the school was left to the highly competent but much put-upon deputy head Mr Keating (Robert Hartley), who was also deputy head under Mrs McClusky up to and including Series 7 in 1984. Similarly, Mr McNab was never seen at all during the mid-1990s; the most senior authority figure being Mr Robson who at this point was deputy head. Mr Robson himself did not appear on screen during Series 27, even though he was still headmaster for the early part of the series. Mrs McClusky, perhaps Grange Hill&#x27;s best known head teacher, was demoted to deputy head temporarily in 1985 having had to reapply, unsuccessfully, for her post following the merger of Grange Hill with Brookdale and Rodney Bennett. When the new head, Mr Humphries, was killed in a road accident the following year, Mrs McClusky was again acting head and her permanent headship was later confirmed.

The final headmistress of Grange Hill was Miss Gayle, introduced as deputy head in the 2007 series although she did not appear in Series 31.

== Cast ==
== Books ==
During the 1980s, when &quot;Grange Hill&quot; merchandising was at its height and the series arguably at its most popular, a number of annuals and novels were published.

Eight annuals were published from 1981 to 1988.

Comic strip adventures appeared in the short-lived &quot;BEEB&quot; magazine, which portrayed new stories, and the longer running &quot;Fast forward&quot; magazine which loosely followed the early 90s series, drawn by Nigel Parkinson. Additional comic strips occurred in &quot;School Fun&quot; and in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. &quot;Grange Hill&quot; had its own dedicated magazine, but this only lasted two issues and a holiday special.

There were 14 short story books and novels, some of which were written or co-written by series creator Phil Redmond, but which also involved authors such as Robert Leeson and Jan Needle. Below is a full list of Grange Hill short story books and novels:

It also includes a brief study of the history of children&#x27;s TV series and serials from 1960 to 1990.

== Video game ==

In 1987 a video game was released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC.

A text adventure based on the series was written in 1985 for the BBC Micro and several other systems. It was mentioned as &quot;upcoming&#x27; in several home computer magazines of the time but was not released.

== Home media ==
Highlights of the first and second series were released on VHS and laserdisc in the early 1980s. Both series were edited to remove some storylines and thereby shorten running times, given the duration of early videocassettes &amp; Laserdiscs. The cover art for series 1 features a cast photograph (and small photos of specific individual characters) from series 3, as some characters pictured therein do not feature in that series. The cover art for series 2 features a similarly styled front cover, but with a cast photo from the correct year.

These abridged versions of the first two series of the show were also released on Betamax and Video 2000 around the same time.

To commemorate the 30th Anniversary of &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, 2 Entertain released two DVD box sets covering the first four series which were released on 12 November 2007. They were both rated PG by the British Board of film classification. There are no subtitles, episodes are in 4:3 (the original format) and both box sets come with a booklet detailing each episode. Some episodes have been edited to remove pop music tracks that could not be cleared for DVD release, and studio scenes originally shot on video have been filmized.

In 2018 the DVD rights were acquired by &quot;Eureka Entertainment&quot;. Series five and six were released on DVD on 19 November 2018. Series seven and eight including the 1981 Christmas Special were released on DVD on 11 November 2019. Series nine and ten including the 1985 Christmas Special where released on 19 October 2020. In 2021 &quot;Eureka Entertainment&quot; confirmed there will be no further series of Grange Hill released on DVD.

In January 2021, Britbox announced that the first four series of Grange Hill will be available to stream. Series 5-6 were added in July, series 7 in August, Series 8 in November 2021, Series 9 in January 2022 &amp; Series 10 &amp; 11 in July. Series 12 &amp; 13 of the series were added to BritBox &amp; ITVX in January 2023, Series 14 was added in July 2023, Series 15-23 were added in December 2023.

<text>Arto Records was a record company and label that operated from 1920 to 1923.

Arto was owned by the Standard Music Roll Company in Orange, New Jersey. The recording studio was located in New York City. Arto was one of the first labels to issue releases of vaudeville blues musicians. It also issued Lucille Hegamin and the Original Memphis Five.

Arto issued a Black Label series of popular music including such artists as The California Ramblers and Vernon Dalhart, and a Red Label series of classical and ethnic music that included the Peerless Quartet and Fred Van Eps.

Arto pressed masters for other record companies, including Nordskog Records for Kid Ory&#x27;s band, the first black band from New Orleans to be recorded, and Arto&#x27;s sister company Bell Records. The label licensed masters from other companies, particularly for release on the Red Label series.

<text>Durium was a short-lived record label in the United Kingdom run by Durium Products (GB) Ltd in the 1930s.
Its presses were located in Slough, near London. Its products and marketing were derived from the American record company Durium Products, Inc., producer of the Hit of the Week record label. Durium Products sold its single-sided paper gramophone records from around 1930 to 1933 whereas the UK firm operated only from 1932 to 1933. Their records were also exported to other European countries, including Sweden and Denmark (see illustration).

Using the fast-setting new material Durium, the label&#x27;s production costs were much lower than for the shellac discs of the time. Hit of the Week discs sold for just one shilling and enjoyed great popularity.

<text>Ivan Dominic Illich ( ; ; 4 September 1926 – 2 December 2002) was an Austrian Catholic priest, theologian, philosopher, and social critic. His 1971 book &quot;Deschooling Society&quot; criticises modern society&#x27;s institutional approach to education, an approach that demotivates and alienates individuals from the process of learning. His 1975 book &quot;Medical Nemesis&quot;, importing to the sociology of medicine the concept of medical harm, argues that industrialised society widely impairs quality of life by overmedicalising life, pathologizing normal conditions, creating false dependency, and limiting other more healthful solutions. Illich called himself &quot;an errant pilgrim.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ivan Dominic Illich was born on 4 September 1926 in Vienna, Austria, to Gian Pietro Ilic (Ivan Peter Illich) and Ellen Rose &quot;Maexie&quot; née Regenstreif-Ortlieb. His father was a civil engineer and a diplomat from a landed Catholic family of Dalmatia, with property in the city of Split and wine and olive oil estates on the island of Brač. His mother came from a Jewish family that had converted to Christianity from Germany and Austria-Hungary (Czernowitz, Bukowina). Ellen Illich was baptized Lutheran but converted to Catholicism upon marriage. Her father, Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Regenstreif, was an industrialist who made his money in the lumber trade in Bosnia, later settling in Vienna, where he built an art nouveau villa.

Ellen Illich traveled to Vienna to be attended by the best doctors during childbirth; Ivan&#x27;s father was not living in Central Europe at the time. When Ivan was three months old, he was taken along with his nurse to Split, Dalmatia (by then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), to be shown to his paternal grandfather. There he was baptized on 1 December 1926. In 1929 twin boys, Alexander and Michael, were born in the family.

===Work in Europe and the Americas===
In 1942, Ellen Illich and her three children—Ivan, Alexander, and Michael—left Vienna, Austria for Florence, Italy, escaping the Nazi persecution of Jews. Illich finished high school in Florence, and then went on to study histology and crystallography at the local University of Florence. Hoping to return to Austria following World War II, he enrolled in a doctorate in medieval history at the University of Salzburg with the hope of gaining legal residency as he was undocumented. He wrote a dissertation focusing on the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, a subject to which he would return in his later years. While working on his doctorate, he returned to Italy where he studied theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, as he wanted to become a Catholic priest. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in Rome in 1951 and served his first Mass in the catacombs where the early Roman Christians hid from their persecutors.

A polyglot, Illich spoke Italian, Spanish, French, and German fluently. He later learned Croatian, the language of his grandfathers, then Ancient Greek and Latin, in addition to Portuguese, Hindi, English, and other languages.

Following his ordination in 1951, he moved to the United States in order to pursue postgraduate studies at Princeton University. However, he deviated from these plans in order to become a parish priest at the Church of the Incarnation in Washington Heights, at that time a barrio of newly-arrived Puerto Rican immigrants. At Incarnation, Illich preached under the name of &quot;John Illich&quot;, at the suggestion of the parish&#x27;s pastor, who said that the name Ivan &quot;sounded communist&quot;. At Incarnation, Illich rose to prominence as an ally of the large Puerto Rican community in Washington Heights, organizing cultural outlets for them, such as the San Juan Fiesta, a celebration of Puerto Rico and its patron saint which eventually evolved into the still-extant Puerto Rican Day Parade. The success of Illich attracted the attention of the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Spellman, and in 1956, at the age of 30, he was appointed vice-rector of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, &quot;a position he managed to keep for several years before getting thrown out—Illich was just a little too loud in his criticism of the Vatican&#x27;s pronouncements on birth control and comparatively demure silence about the nuclear bomb.&quot; It was in Puerto Rico that Illich met Everett Reimer, and the two began to analyze their own functions as &quot;educational&quot; leaders. In 1959, he traveled throughout South America on foot and by bus.

The end of Illich&#x27;s tenure at the university came in 1960 as the result of a controversy involving bishops James Edward McManus and James Peter Davis, who had denounced Governor Luis Muñoz Marín and his Popular Democratic Party for their positions in favor of birth control and divorce. The bishops also started their own rival Catholic party. Illich later summarized his opposition:

As a historian, I saw that it violated the American tradition of Church and State separation. As a politician, I predicted that there wasn&#x27;t enough strength in Catholic ranks to create a meaningful platform and that failure of McManus&#x27;s party would be disastrous on the already frail prestige of the Puerto Rican Church. As a theologian, I believe that the Church must always condemn injustice in the light of the Gospel, but never has the right to speak in favor of a specific political party.

After Illich disobeyed a direct order from McManus forbidding all priests from dining with Governor Muñoz, McManus ordered Illich to leave his post at the university, describing his presence as &quot;dangerous to the Diocese of Ponce and its institutions.&quot;

Despite this display of insubordination and an order from Paul Francis Tanner, then general secretary of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, forbidding Illich from any official role in the organization&#x27;s Latin American bureau, Illich maintained the support of the influential priest John J. Considine, who continued to push for Illich to have a role in training the Church&#x27;s missionaries, personally funding trips to Mexico in order for Illich to scout locations.

Following his departure from Puerto Rico, Illich moved to Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he founded the Center of Intercultural Formation (CIF) in 1961, originally as a missionary training center. As the center became more influential, it became the Centro Intercultural de Documentación (CIDOC, or Intercultural Documentation Center), ostensibly a research center offering language courses to missionaries from North America and volunteers of the Alliance for Progress program initiated by John F. Kennedy. His real intent was to document the participation of the Vatican in the &quot;modern development&quot; of the so-called Third World. Illich looked askance at the liberal pity or conservative imperiousness that motivated the rising tide of global industrial development. He viewed such emissaries as a form of industrial hegemony and, as such, an act of &quot;war on subsistence&quot;. He sought to teach missionaries dispatched by the Church not to impose their own cultural values. &quot;Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, CIDOC was part language school and part free university for intellectuals from all over the Americas.&quot; At the CIDOC, &quot;Illich was able to develop his potent and highly influential critique of Third World development schemes and their fresh-faced agents: Kennedy&#x27;s Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps, and countless other missionary efforts bankrolled and organized by wealthy nations, foundations, and religious groups.&quot;

After ten years, critical analysis from the CIDOC of the institutional actions by the Church brought the organization into conflict with the Vatican due to associations with liberation theology and suspicions of Marxism. Unpopular with the local chapter of Opus Dei, Illich was called to Rome for questioning, due in part to a CIA report. While he was not convicted or punished by the Vatican, it was then that he decided to renounce active priesthood. In 1976, apparently concerned by the influx of formal academics and the potential side effects of its own &quot;institutionalization&quot;, Illich shut the center down with consent from the other members of the CIDOC. Several of the members subsequently continued language schools in Cuernavaca, some of which still exist. Illich, who had been made a monsignor at 33, himself resigned from the active priesthood in the late 1960s but continued to identify as a priest and occasionally performed private masses.

In the 1970s, Illich was popular among leftist intellectuals in France, his thesis having been discussed in particular by André Gorz. However, his influence declined after the 1981 election of François Mitterrand, as Illich was considered too pessimistic at a time when the French Left took control of the government.

In the 1980s and beyond, Illich traveled extensively, mainly splitting his time between the United States, Mexico, and Germany. He held an appointment as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy, Science, Technology, and Society at Pennsylvania State University. He also taught at the University of Bremen and University of Hagen. During the last days of his life he admitted that he was greatly influenced by one of the Indian economists and adviser to M. K. Gandhi, J. C. Kumarappa, most notably his book, &quot;Economy of Permanence&quot;.

While Illich never referred to himself as an anarchist in print, he was closely associated with major figures in left-anarchist circles, notably Paul Goodman and unschooling advocate John Holt. Goodman is credited in &quot;Deschooling Society&quot; with having &quot;radically obliged&quot; Illich to revise his thinking and is described with great affection in Illich&#x27;s 1990s interviews with David Cayley:

==Personal life==
Ivan Illich called himself &quot;an errant pilgrim&quot;, &quot;a wandering Jew and a Christian pilgrim&quot;, while clearly acknowledging his Dalmatian roots. He remarked that since leaving the old house of his grandparents on the island Brač in Dalmatia, he had never had a home.

===Death===
Illich died on 2 December 2002 in Bremen, Germany. Not realised was his last wish: to die surrounded by close collaborators in Bologna amid the creation of his planned, new learning centre.

==Philosophical views==
Illich followed the tradition of apophatic theology. His lifework&#x27;s leading thesis is that Western modernity, perverting Christianity, corrupts Western Christianity. A perverse attempt to encode the New Testament&#x27;s principles as rules of behavior, duty, or laws, and to institutionalize them, without limits, is a corruption that Illich detailed in his analyses of modern Western institutions, including education, charity, and medicine, among others. Illich often used the Latin phrase &quot;Corruptio optimi quae est pessima&quot;, in English &quot;The corruption of the best is the worst&quot;.

Illich believed that the Biblical God taking human form, the Incarnation, marked world history&#x27;s turning point, opening new possibilities for love and knowledge. As in the First Epistle of John, it invites any believer to seek God&#x27;s face in everyone encountered. Describing this new possibility for love, Illich refers to the Parable of the Good Samaritan.

== Influence ==

His first book, &quot;Deschooling Society&quot;, published in 1971, was a groundbreaking critique of compulsory mass education. He argued the oppressive structure of the school system could not be reformed. It must be dismantled in order to free humanity from the crippling effects of the institutionalization of all of life. He went on to critique modern mass medicine. Illich was highly influential among intellectuals and academics. He became known worldwide for his progressive polemics about how activity expressive of truly human values could be preserved and expanded in human society in the face of widespread de-humanization.

In his several influential books, he argued that the overuse of the benefits of many modern technologies and social arrangements undermines human values and human self-sufficiency, freedom, and dignity. His in-depth critiques of mass education and modern mass medicine were especially, pointed, relevant; and perhaps, more timely now than during his life.

Health, argues Illich, is the capacity to cope with the human reality of death, pain, and sickness. Technology can benefit many; yet, modern mass medicine has gone too far, launching into a godlike battle to eradicate death, pain, and sickness. In doing so, it turns people into risk-averse consuming objects, turning healing into mere science, turning medical healers into mere drug-surgical technicians.

The Dark Mountain Project, a creative cultural movement founded by Dougald Hine and Paul Kingsnorth that abandons the myths of modern societies and looks for other new stories that help us make sense of modernity, drew their inspiration from the ideas of Ivan Illich.

==Published works==

===&quot;Deschooling Society&quot;===
Illich gained public attention with his 1971 book &quot;Deschooling Society&quot;, a radical critique of educational practice in &quot;modern&quot; economies. Claiming examples of institutionalised education&#x27;s ineffectiveness, Illich endorses self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements:

The final sentence, above, clarifies Illich&#x27;s view that education&#x27;s institutionalisation fosters society&#x27;s institutionalisation, and so de-institutionalising education may help de-institutionalize society. Further, Illich suggests reinventing learning and expanding it throughout society and across persons&#x27; lifespans. Particularly striking in 1971 was his call for advanced technology to support &quot;learning webs&quot;:

According to a review in the &quot;Libertarian Forum&quot;, &quot;Illich&#x27;s advocacy of the free market in education is the bone in the throat that is choking the public educators.&quot; Yet, unlike libertarians, Illich opposes not merely publicly funded schooling, but schools as such. Thus, Illich&#x27;s envisioned disestablishment of schools aimed not to establish a free market in educational services, but to attain a fundamental shift: a deschooled society. In his 1973 book &quot;After Deschooling, What?&quot;, he asserted, &quot;We can disestablish schools, or we can deschool culture.&quot; In fact, he called advocates of free-market education &quot;the most dangerous category of educational reformers.&quot;

&quot;Deschooling Society&quot; was highly regarded by John Holt and other leading advocates of unschooling, and has been widely read in the homeschooling community since its dramatic growth during the 1980s.

===&quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot;===

&quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; was published in 1973, two years after &quot;Deschooling Society&quot;. In this newer work, Illich generalizes the themes that he had previously applied to the educational field: the institutionalization of specialized knowledge, the dominant role of technocratic elites in industrial society, and the need to develop new instruments for the reconquest of practical knowledge by the average citizen. He wrote that &quot;[e]lite professional groups ... have come to exert a &#x27;radical monopoly&#x27; on such basic human activities as health, agriculture, home-building, and learning, leading to a &#x27;war on subsistence&#x27; that robs peasant societies of their vital skills and know-how. The result of much economic development is very often not human flourishing but &#x27;modernized poverty&#x27;, dependency, and an out-of-control system in which the humans become worn-down mechanical parts.&quot; Illich proposed that we should &quot;invert the present deep structure of tools&quot; in order to &quot;give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency.&quot;

&quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; attracted worldwide attention. A résumé of it was published by French social philosopher André Gorz in &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot;, under the title &quot;Freeing the Future&quot;. The book&#x27;s vision of tools that would be developed and maintained by a community of users had a significant influence on the first developers of the personal computer, notably Lee Felsenstein.

===&quot;Medical Nemesis&quot;===
In his &quot;Medical Nemesis&quot;, first published in 1975, also known as &quot;Limits to Medicine&quot;, Illich subjected contemporary Western medicine to detailed attack. He argued that the medicalization in recent decades of so many of life&#x27;s vicissitudes—birth and death, for example—frequently caused more harm than good and rendered many people in effect lifelong patients. He marshalled a body of statistics to show what he considered the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects and drug-induced illness in advanced industrial society. He introduced to a wider public the notion of iatrogenic disease, which had been scientifically established a century earlier by British nurse Florence Nightingale (1820–1910). Others have since voiced similar views.

===&quot;To Hell with Good Intentions&quot;===
In his 1968 speech at the Conference on InterAmerican Student Projects (CIASP), Illich strongly opposes the presence of American Roman Catholic missionaries, the Peace Corps and organizations like the CIASP themselves - who invited him to speak - in Mexico. Illich says that the presence of American &quot;do-gooders&quot; is causing more harm than good. Rather, he suggests that the Americans should travel to Latin America as tourists or students, or else stay in their homeland, where they can at least know what they are doing.

<doc id="236519" wikidata="Q26063" url="?curid=236519" title="Australian pelican">
<text>The Australian pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus) is a large waterbird in the family Pelecanidae, widespread on the inland and coastal waters of Australia and New Guinea, also in Fiji, parts of Indonesia and as a vagrant in New Zealand. It is a predominantly white bird with black wings and a pink bill. It has been recorded as having the longest bill of any living bird. It mainly eats fish, but will also consume birds and scavenge for scraps if the opportunity arises.

== Taxonomy ==
The Australian pelican was first described by Dutch naturalist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin verb , meaning &#x27;to behold&#x27;, and refers to the &#x27;spectacled&#x27; appearance created by its conspicuous eye markings.

=== Description ===
The Australian pelican is medium-sized by pelican standards, with a wingspan of . Weight can range from , although most of these pelicans weigh between . The average weight of four unsexed Australian pelicans was , making this the second heaviest Australian flying bird species on average, after the brolga, although the male of the more sexually dimorphic Australian bustard weighs a bit more at average and maximum weights (both birds are, of course, much smaller than the cassowary and emu). The pale, pinkish bill is enormous, even by pelican standards, and is the largest bill in the avian world. The record-sized bill was long. Females are slightly smaller with a notably smaller bill, which can measure as small as at maturity. The total length is boosted by the bill to , which makes it rank alongside the Dalmatian pelican as the longest of pelicans.

Overall, the Australian pelican is predominantly white in colour. There is a white panel on the upper-wing and a white-V on the rump set against black along the primaries. During courtship, the orbital skin and distal quarter of the bill are orange-coloured with the pouch variously turning dark blue, pink and scarlet. The non-breeding adult has its bill and eye-ring a pale yellow and the pouch is a pale pinkish. Juvenile birds are similar to the adults, but with black replaced with brown and the white patch on upper wing reduced. Overall, their appearance is somewhat similar to several other pelicans, though the species is allopatric.

==Distribution and habitat==

This species can occur in large expanses of mainland Australia and Tasmania. Australian pelicans occur primarily in large expanses of open water without dense aquatic vegetation. The habitats that can support them include large lakes, reservoirs, billabongs and rivers, as well as estuaries, swamps, temporarily flooded areas in arid zones, drainage channels in farmland, salt evaporation ponds and coastal lagoons. The surrounding environment is unimportant: it can be forest, grassland, desert, estuarine mudflats, an ornamental city park, or industrial wasteland, provided only that there is open water able to support a sufficient supply of food. However, they do seem to prefer areas where disturbance is relatively low while breeding. They may also roost on mudflats, sandbars, beaches, reefs, jetties and pilings.

The species became first known to occur in New Zealand from a specimen shot at Jerusalem in 1890 and small numbers of subfossil bones, the first found at Lake Grassmere in 1947, followed by records of other stray individuals. The bones were later described as a new (sub)species, &quot;Pelecanus (conspicillatus) novaezealandiae&quot; (Scarlett, 1966: &quot;New Zealand pelican&quot;) as they appeared to be larger, but Worthy (1998), reviewing new material, determined that they were not separable from the Australian population. These fossils were first found in 1930.

Australian pelicans follow no particular schedule of regular movement, simply following the availability of food supplies. Drought frequently precedes movements. When the normally barren Lake Eyre filled during 1974 to 1976, for example, only a handful of pelicans remained around the coastal cities: when the great inland lakes dried again, the population dispersed once more, flocks of thousands being seen on the northern coasts. On some occasions, they are simply blown by the wind to new locations. It is a fairly regular visitor to the southern coast of New Guinea, as well as the Bismarck Islands and Solomon Islands. It occurs as a vagrant to Christmas Island, Vanuatu, Fiji, Palau and New Zealand. A population irruption occurred in 1978 into Indonesia, with Australian pelicans reaching Sulawesi, Java and possibly also Sumatra.

==Feeding==
Australian pelicans feed by plunge-diving while swimming on the surface of the water. They work in groups to drive fish to shallower water, where they stick their sensitive bills in to snatch their prey. Some feeding grounds in large bodies of water have included up to 1,900 individual birds. They will sometimes also forage solitarily. Their predominant prey is fish and they commonly feed on introduced species such as goldfish, European carp and European perch. When possible, they also eat native fish, with a seeming preference for the perch &quot;Leiopotherapon unicolor&quot;. However, the Australian pelican seems to be less of a piscivore and less picky in taste than other pelicans. It regularly feeds on insects and many aquatic crustaceans, especially the common yabby, prawns and the shrimps in the genus &quot;Macrobrachium&quot;. This pelican also takes other birds with some frequency, such as silver gulls, Australian white ibis and grey teal, including eggs, nestlings, fledglings and adults, which they may kill by pinning them underwater and drowning them. Reptiles, amphibians and small mammals are also taken when available. Reportedly even small dogs have been swallowed. The Australian pelican is an occasional kleptoparasite of other water birds, such as cormorants. Cannibalism of young pelicans has also been reported.

==Breeding==
The Australian pelican begins breeding at two or three years of age. The breeding season varies, occurring in winter in tropical areas (north of 26°S) and spring in parts of southern Australia. Breeding may occur any time after rainfall in inland areas. The nest is a shallow depression in earth or sand, sometimes with some grass lining. Grassy platforms are constructed at Lake Alexandrina in South Australia. Rarely, slightly more elaborate nests have also been observed on top of &quot;Muehlenbeckia florulenta&quot; bushes. Nesting is communal, with colonies located on islands (such as the North Peron Island) or sheltered areas in the vicinity of lakes or the sea. Breeding Australian pelicans will lay one to four (typically two) chalky-white eggs measuring , which often appear scratched and dirty. The eggs are incubated for 32 to 35 days. The chicks are naked when they hatch, though quickly grow grey down feathers. After they hatch, the larger one will be fed more, and the smaller one will eventually die of starvation or siblicide. For the first two weeks the chicks will be fed regurgitated liquid, but for the remaining two months they will be fed fish and some invertebrates. Feeding pods are formed within colonies when the chicks are around 25 days. The young pelicans fledge at around three months of age.

==Status==

The Australian pelican is not globally threatened. They are usually fairly common in proper habitats. At the aforementioned temporary inundation of Lake Eyre in March 1990, over 200,000 adult birds were found to be breeding. The species is legally protected and does not seem to be showing any immediate adverse effects from pollution.

In several areas, such as the beach at Monkey Mia, Western Australia and at The Entrance, New South Wales, pelicans may associate with humans and may even beg for hand-outs, but they are quite sensitive to human disturbances while nesting. They will readily adapt to artificial bodies of water such as reservoirs so long as there is no regular boating in them. Due to the popularity of open water sports, the habitat of the Australian pelican has suffered considerably less than more vegetated wetlands throughout Australia. The Australian pelican is evaluated as a least-concern species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
==Local names==

In parts of South Australia the pelican is known by its Ngaarrindjeri name, &quot;nori&quot;. It was the totem of singer Ruby Hunter.

<doc id="236521" wikidata="Q6516113" url="?curid=236521" title="Leeds Talk-o-Phone">
<text>Leeds Talk-O-Phone was a record label, producing cylinders from 1894 to 1903 and single-sided lateral-cut disc phonograph records in the United States of America from about 1902 to 1909.

Leeds Records were produced by the Talk-O-Phone Company of Toledo, Ohio, owned by Wynant van Zant Pierce Bradley and Albert Irish. Talk-O-Phone produced disc phonographs (&quot;gramophones&quot; in British English) very similar to the earliest &quot;Victor&quot; machines of the Victor Talking Machine Company.

Some Leeds Records were unauthorized dubs of recordings made in other countries, a practice that slipped through a legal loophole at the time when international copyrights on recorded sound was poorly regulated. Some printed speculation about this obscure early record label has alleged that all Leeds material was either leased or pirated from other companies, but this was not the case. Some Leeds records were recorded specifically for Leeds, as can be confirmed by the spoken announcements at the beginning of the records. There was, however, an artist dishonesty incident in the late 1890s with Russell Hunting. Leeds had Hunting record a specialty of his called &quot;Cohen at the Telephone&quot;. He was paid $5 per &quot;round&quot;, as pantographic duplication yielded about 100 acceptable duplicates of a cylinder. At the end of the fourth round (recording into 4 machines yielded 16 masters) he saw a man carting 24 recordings of his &quot;Cohen at the Telephone&quot; away at the end of the studio. Hunting accused Leeds of attempting to defraud him. Leeds Talk-O-Phone, according to Hunting, made good upon being threatened with exposure.

A few Vaudeville stars of some note recorded for Leeds, including Byron G. Harlan. The audio fidelity of original Leeds recordings is about comparable to Victor or Columbia Records discs of some 5 years earlier.

The most notable feature of early Leeds records are the labels at the center of the discs, some of the most elaborate and beautiful ever to grace phonograph records. The labels are coated in embossed gold foil in high relief, with a trio of angels flying in clouds beside &quot;LEEDS TALK-O-PHONE RECORDS&quot; in elaborate flowing lettering. The lower portion of the label shows the record number, song title, and artist, in much more plain type. The whole is surrounded by a floral border.

In the early 20th century, the quality of Leeds records improved. Leeds records were issued under the rare &quot;Century&quot; label, the &quot;Sir Henri&quot; label, the &quot;Imperial&quot; label, and many others. None of these labels credited Leeds as the manufacturer, likely as Leeds was usually in court for infringing some patent, trademark, etc. In 1905, Leeds was rumored to have begun plans for returning to producing cylinders, sending Edison investigators scattering about. Leeds made its last known cylinders in 1903, in brown wax. Columbia made molded brown waxes at this time and introduced black waxes in 1903. This stopped Leeds cylinder production. If Leeds really &quot;did&quot; resume cylinder production in 1905, the cylinders would have to have been molded black waxes or they would not have survived on the market if they were brown. Columbia stopped brown wax molding in 1904, thus eliminating any niche competition for Leeds brown waxes. No supposed Leeds cylinders from ca. 1905 survive, nor do any Leeds cylinder catalogs.

In April 1909 Victor triumphed in a lawsuit for patent infringement, and Leeds Records and Talk-O-Phone went out of business.

<doc id="236524" wikidata="Q1427958" url="?curid=236524" title="Tithi">
<text>In Vedic timekeeping, a tithi is a &quot;duration of two faces of moon that is observed from earth&quot;, known as &quot;milа̄lyа̄&quot; () in Nepal Bhasa, or the time it takes for the longitudinal angle between the Moon and the Sun to increase by 12°. In other words, a tithi is a time duration between the consecutive epochs that correspond to when the longitudinal angle between the Sun and the Moon is an integer multiple of 12°. Tithis begin at varying times of day and vary in duration approximately from 19 to 26 hours. Every day of a lunar month is called tithi.

==Panchanga==

A Hindu &quot;muhurta&quot; (forty-eight minute duration) can be represented in five attributes of Hindu astronomy namely, &quot;vara&quot; the weekday, &quot;tithi&quot;, &quot;nakshatra&quot; the Moon&#x27;s asterism, &quot;yoga&quot; the angular relationship between Sun and Moon and &quot;karana&quot; half of tithi.

&quot;Tithi&quot; plays an important role along with &quot;nakshatra&quot; in Hindus&#x27; daily as well as special activities in selecting the &quot;muhurta&quot;. There are auspicious &quot;tithis&quot; as well as inauspicious &quot;tithis&quot;, each considered more propitious for some purposes than for other.

In &quot;amānta&quot; lunar calenders, &quot;tithi&quot;s are counted beginning at &quot;śukla pratipada&quot;, while in the &quot;pūrṇimānta&quot; lunar calenders, &quot;tithi&quot;s are counted from &quot;kr̥ṣṇa pratipada&quot;. The &quot;śukla&quot; &quot;tithi&quot;s are when the moon waxes, and the &quot;kr̥ṣṇa tithi&quot;s are when the moon wanes. The average &quot;tithi&quot; lasts 23 hours 37.5 minutes, and can range from 19 hours 59 minutes to 26 hours 47 minutes. The calculation of &quot;tithi&quot; timings may also differ on whether one uses the traditional methods for calculating the Sun and Moon&#x27;s movement as promulgated in the &quot;Sūrya Siddhānta&quot; or modern methods which correctly calculate the true motions of the Sun and Moon. The &quot;tithi&quot; in place at the sunrise is consider the &quot;&quot;tithi&quot; of the day&quot;, although the &quot;tithi&quot; may end before the next sunrise in which case the next &quot;tithi&quot; begins. Because the length of a &quot;tithi&quot; is also variable a case can arise where a &quot;tithi&quot; begins after sunrise and ends prior to the next sunrise, which is called a &quot;kṣaya tithi&quot;. The opposite phenomenon can occur where a &quot;tithi&quot; in place during a sunrise is still present in the following sunrise which is called an &quot;adhika&quot; or &quot;ahorātra tithi&quot;. 

There are 30 &quot;tithis&quot; in each lunar month, named as:

<text>Lyric Records was a record label based in the United States from about 1917 to 1921.

The parent company of Lyric Records was initially listed on the label as the &quot;Lyraphone Company of America, New York City&quot;, although actually headquartered in Newark, New Jersey. Later labels reflected the actual location. The label artwork featured a drawing of a white cat (perhaps inspired by the dog Nipper of the Victor Talking Machine Company&#x27;s &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; logo) seated on a phonograph record, with the legend &quot;Never Scratches&quot;. Lyric Records actually seem to be exactly as prone to scratching as any other shellac 78rpm record of the era.

The first Lyric records were vertical-cut with an unusually narrow groove that required using steel needles, related to that used by British &quot;Marathon&quot; discs, which according to company publicity yielded a playing time of four-and-a-half minutes per 10-inch side and seven minutes per 12-inch side. Over 1000 titles were available by September 1917, including popular vocal, dance, operatic, and orchestral selections. J. Louis von der Mehden was the company&#x27;s chief conductor, and his diaries (now at the University of Connecticut) detail recording sessions with a 40-player orchestra which he personally recruited, a much larger ensemble than most American recording groups. The recorded sound of Lyric vertical-cut discs is superior to most other contemporary American &quot;hill-and-dale&quot; records. From 1919 Lyric records were double-sided lateral-cut 10-inch discs which have slightly above-average sound quality for the era. The company went into receivership in the fall of 1921 and ceased operations sometime the following year.

Among those recording for Lyric were soprano Regina Vicarino, violinist Vera Barstow, tenor &quot;Mario Rodolfi&quot; (the first stage name of opera star Mario Chamlee), vaudeville comedian and prolific early sound recording star Billy Murray and Harry Yerkes&#x27; band featuring early jazz trombonist Tom Brown. The celebrated Polish pianist and composer Sigismund Stojowski made his only records for Lyric, of Anton Rubinstein&#x27;s &quot;Valse caprice&quot; in E-flat and Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Waltz in A-flat major op. 42.

<text>Paul Henry O&#x27;Neill (December 4, 1935 April 18, 2020) was an American businessman and government official who served as the 72nd United States Secretary of the Treasury for part of President George W. Bush&#x27;s first term, from January 2001 until his resignation in December 2002. Prior to his term as Secretary, O&#x27;Neill was chairman and CEO of industrial giant Alcoa and chairman of the RAND Corporation.

==Early life and education==

O&#x27;Neill was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Gaynald Elsie (née Irvin) and John Paul O&#x27;Neill, an army sergeant. His father claimed that he was from Scotland and that he did not know where his family was anymore. A long time after his death, however, Paul discovered that he was actually from the Netherlands and was originally named Piet Kalfsterman, though it is not known why he lied to his family about his background.

Due to his father&#x27;s transfers, the family had to change residences often. They lived in Illinois, Hawaii, New Mexico and Alaska. As a teenager, Paul worked part-time jobs including as a paperboy and as a clerk at a convenience store. He graduated from Anchorage High School in Anchorage, Alaska in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from California State University, Fresno, studied economics at Claremont Graduate University in 1961, and received a Master of Public Administration from Indiana University.

== Career ==

O&#x27;Neill began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the United States Office of Management and Budget in 1967 and served as its deputy director from 1974 to 1977.

O&#x27;Neill along with Kenneth W. Dam and William A. Morrill resisted President Richard Nixon in 1973 when he tried cutting off federal funding to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in retaliation for it allowing anti-war protests over the Vietnam War. The three threatened to resign and reminded Nixon that the executive office could not rescind the federal grants, forcing him to back down. According to Frank Zarb, he, O&#x27;Neill, Roy Ash and Fred Malek mostly ran the government in 1974 as Nixon&#x27;s authority was eroded with the Watergate scandal.

=== Private sector ===
After President Gerald Ford lost the 1976 election, O&#x27;Neill took an executive job at International Paper in New York City. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.

O&#x27;Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant Alcoa from 1987 to 1999 and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O&#x27;Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing worker safety. One argued reason that he could remain in office was his level of CEO power. The company&#x27;s market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.

In 1988, O&#x27;Neill joined the RAND Corporation as a member of its board of trustees and in 1997 was elected as its chairperson. He resigned after being appointed as the treasury secretary, but was appointed to RAND&#x27;s board of trustees again in 2003 after losing his job. He also served on RAND Health&#x27;s advisory board.

After being dismissed as Treasury Secretary, he became a special advisor for The Blackstone Group. In addition he also acted as an angel investor with his son Paul Jr. for Qcept Technologies Inc. in 2004, and joined it as a board director. In 2005, he established a consulting firm named Value Capture that advises health care institutions on reducing expenses as well as increasing safety of patients.

=== Community service ===

In 1989, he was approached by George H. W. Bush to serve as Secretary of Defense. O&#x27;Neill declined but recommended Dick Cheney for the position instead. Bush then pursued and convinced O&#x27;Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included Lamar Alexander, Bill Brock, and Richard Riley.

In December 1997, O&#x27;Neill together with Karen Wolk Feinstein, President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative (PRHI). They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin addressing the problems of healthcare as a region. PRHI adapted the principles of the Toyota Production System into the &quot;Perfecting Patient Care&quot; system. O&#x27;Neill became a leader locally and nationally in addressing issues of patient safety and quality in healthcare.

O&#x27;Neill was a co-founder of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Riverlife Task Force, established in 1999. He served on its very first task force with Jim Rohr, Teresa Heinz, the CEO of Richard King Mellon Foundation Mike Watson, the President of the Heinz Endowments Mark King and the editor of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; John G. Craig Jr. among others.

O&#x27;Neill was also a member of the Dean&#x27;s Advisory Council of Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Heinz College. In addition, he served on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

In 2006, he published the results of a study conducted from 2003 to 2005 at Allegheny General Hospital along with a team of doctors led by Richard Shannon, in the &quot;Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety&quot;. It showed reduction in infections through a team coordinating to prevent infections in the bloodstream. He also rejoined PRHI as its CEO in October 2003. O&#x27;Neill became a trustee of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in February 2003, but left in September 2004 due to it not joining a programme to make hospitals eliminate medical errors. During his tenure he often disagreed with UPMC&#x27;s CEO Jeffrey Romoff and also opposed its plans to shut Highmark-insured patients out of receiving treatment at affiliated hospitals in 2019.

In June 2019, he was awarded the Gerald R. Ford Medal for Distinguished Public Service by the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation.

=== Bush administration ===
O&#x27;Neill was appointed as the secretary of the treasury by the newly elected president George W. Bush in January 2001. He believed in fiscal prudence, increasing productivity and also encouraging workers with safeguards for their jobs. As the secretary he strongly disagreed with the strong dollar policy, ceremonial speeches and large bailouts, while favoring personally touring American factories and reducing the length of written statements by the finance ministers belonging to the Group of Seven. O&#x27;Neill saw the United States through the 2001 recession and 9/11 attacks. He initially helped pass the first tax cuts under the Bush administration but stringently opposed the second. He also clashed with Bush on his steel tariffs as well as actions against Cuba.

O&#x27;Neill also helped Turkey, Argentina and Brazil in receiving loans from the International Monetary Fund but opposed more financial assistance. His cavalcade was once attacked with eggs during a visit to Argentina because of his stating the country had “no industry to speak of.” He however also encouraged governments to increase grants by the World Bank and cracking down on monetary support of terrorism. In this regard, he encouraged governments to further regulate non-traditional lending systems such as hawala, and was a strong proponent of integrating largely non-participatory governments, organizations, and individuals into more formal financial institutions. In May 2002, he visited Africa with Bono to draw attention to the continent&#x27;s poor. During his tenure, he was known for his outspokenness which would eventually cost him his job in December 2002.

Ron Suskind interviewed O&#x27;Neill extensively about his tenure in the Bush administration. He was also given access to a large amount of documentation. In 2004 he authored the book &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot;, detailing O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s tenure in the Bush administration. The book describes many of the conflicts that O&#x27;Neill had with the Bush administration. It also details his criticisms of some of Bush&#x27;s economic policies. O&#x27;Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and incurious, and that the Iraq War was planned from the first National Security Council meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O&#x27;Neill observed that the debate was not &quot;should we attack Iraq?&quot; but rather &quot;how do we go about attacking Iraq?&quot; 

==Personal life==

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s siblings included two brothers and a sister. He married Nancy Jo Wolfe, whom he had met while studying at Anchorage High School. He fathered four children including three daughters named Patricia, Margaret, Julie and a son named Paul Jr.

=== Death ===
O&#x27;Neill died at his home in Pittsburgh on April 18, 2020, aged 84, from lung cancer. He is survived by a sister, a brother, his four children, twelve grandchildren and fifteen great-grandchildren.

===Comments and views===
In an October 16, 2007, opinion piece published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he wrote of the reluctance among politicians to address comprehensive reform in the U.S. health care system. In the opinion, he suggested that doctors and hospitals should be required to report medical errors within 24 hours, as well as moving malpractice suits out of the civil courts and into a new, independent body. He also felt that health care reform had to acknowledge all aspects of the problem, such as insurance coverage, medical costs, quality of care, and information technology.

In April 2016, he was one of eight former Treasury secretaries who called on the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union ahead of the June 2016 Referendum.

<doc id="236543" wikidata="Q1336734" url="?curid=236543" title="Ior Bock">
<text>Ior Bock (; originally Bror Holger Svedlin; 17 January 1942 – 23 October 2010) was a Swedish-speaking Finnish tour guide, actor, mythologist and eccentric. Bock was a colourful media personality and became a very popular tour guide at the island fortress of Suomenlinna, where he worked from 1973 to 1998.

In 1984, Bock raised public interest and discussion when he claimed that his family line (Boxström) had been keepers of an ancient folklore tradition that provides insight into the pagan culture of Finland, including hitherto unknown autofellatio exercises connected to old fertility rites. These stories are often known as the Bock saga. His eccentric philosophical and mythological theories gained an outstandingly large international following.

==Biography==

===Birth===
According to Bock&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;The Bock Saga&quot;, he was born as the result of an incestuous relationship between sea-captain Knut Victor Boxström (1860–1942), who would have been 81 years old at the time, and his daughter Rhea, 42. Knut&#x27;s only son had been killed in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, and this was a desperate measure to continue the male line and bring the extensive family-saga about heathen times to the public eye. Knut Victor Boxström died shortly after Ior&#x27;s baptism, one month after his birth. Consequently, he was adopted by Rhea&#x27;s husband, Bror Gustaf Bertil Svedlin.

In 2004, the freelance journalist Magnus Londen published an article where he claimed that Ior Bock was actually an adopted son of Rhea Boxström-Svedlin and Bror Svedlin. According to Londen, official adoption documents in the National Archive in Helsinki prove that Ior&#x27;s biological mother was a 23-year-old gardening instructor in Porvoo. His father was said to be a Spanish sailor. After Bock&#x27;s death, a family friend from Sipoo, quoting her mother, supported the adoption claims. In 2003, Bock had answered Londen&#x27;s queries by explaining that the adoption-theme was a necessary precaution from his mother to hide the incestuous act that led to his birth.

===Adolescence===
According to Magnus Londen&#x27;s article, young Holger Svedlin was sent off to an orphanage for one year at age nine. Londen, citing unnamed acquaintances of the Svedlin family, states that Holger (who had adopted the name Ior, meaning Eeyore in Swedish) had displayed irrational behaviour and that his mother had been unable to cope with him since his adopted father had died the previous year. It was during this period that, according to the stories he later told, his twenty years of daily training into the sound system and secret saga of his family began. It was his biological mother as well as his aunt/sister Rachel who taught him for two hours every day, and only when they were away was he in the orphanage.

At the age of 15, he went into training practice as a lighting technician at Svenska Teatern (the Swedish Theatre) in Helsinki. Here he completed his basic education to become a professional actor at age 21.

====Shooting death of his brother====
In 1962 Ior Svedlin&#x27;s adopted brother, Erik Svedlin, died by a gunshot at the age of 23. Due to his participation in the situation that led to the death, Ior received a probation of four months, on the grounds of &quot;participation in acts that led to involuntary manslaughter&quot;. After his parents&#x27; death, Ior Bock (as he was known by then) stated that Erik Svedlin actually committed suicide due to a family drama – as his planned marriage was disapproved of by his family. Erik&#x27;s fiancé as well as friends have disputed this claim in interviews with Londen. According to Ior Bock&#x27;s version, to avoid a social scandal, the incident was termed an &quot;accidental death&quot; and explained to be a result of the two brothers &quot;playing around&quot;. According to Magnus Londen, the investigation report in the police archive in Helsinki states that the brothers had been listening to music while Ior was dancing and playing with a gun. Ior told the police that the gun went off accidentally when he threw it to his brother. Everyone involved considered the incident to be an accident.

===Professional life and publicity===
According to Magnus Londen, the stories told by Ior Svedlin during his guided tours gradually evolved in a bizarre direction, resulting in a conflict with his employer. From 1984 to 1998 he continued his studies of Sveaborg while guiding on a free-lance basis, using his new name Ior Bock.

Starting in the mid-1970s, Bockström-Svedlin started regularly visiting the well-known hippie paradise Goa on the Arabian Sea coast of India. Every year from October to April he stayed in the small village Chapora, developing a significant crowd of supporters, or apprentices as some back in Finland would call them. According to Londen, Ior Svedlin was interviewed by the Finnish newspaper &quot;Hufvudstadsbladet&quot; in 1982 and he was quoted there giving a statement that Londen has found most poignant in yielding a critical perspective on Ior Bock&#x27;s own biography which he began to present to the public two years thereafter.

====Excavation of the Temple of Lemminkäinen====

In 1987, Ior Bock and his supporters began fund-raising in order to finance excavation of a sediment-filled cave that is situated under the hill &#x27;Sibbosberg&#x27;, situated north of Gumbostrand in Sipoo, 30 km east of Helsinki – at the estate Bock had inherited from his parents. The cave was supposed to lead to a furnished temple-chamber inside the Sibbosberg, known as the &quot;Temple of Lemminkäinen.&quot; Inside of the temple chamber, a spiraling hallway is described, with small hall-rooms that were created to hold the collected treasures from each generation of the heathen culture of ancient Finland. The time of ongoing storage is counted in millennia, accumulating a large treasure chamber. The last storage was done in 987 when the entrance hall was filled and the entrance door closed and hidden, as foreign warlords would enter the Baltic area and - by the year 1050 - reached and conquered the major settlements of southern Finland.

Due to the controversial statements of the family-saga, The National Board of Antiquities in Finland retracted from involving themselves with the project. The participation of professional archaeologists was restricted to limited official visits, during which nothing archaeologically significant was observed. In one archaeological survey, the Gumbo cave was defined as a natural formation of geological interest. According to the surveying archaeologist, the only man-made feature there was a recent rock carving.

In 1990, police arrested Bock and 33 other participants in the dig on suspicion of the use and distribution of Indian hemp. When the court sentenced three of Bock&#x27;s foreign companions the results were a public scandal and the withdrawal of the sponsor of the excavation, the major construction company Lemminkäinen Group. Since then, smaller digs have been made. In 1999, a stabbing left Bock quadriplegic. When Bock was still in hospital, his debts to the Lemminkäinen Group and a geotechnical contractor (from 1992) were used to instigate a process against him for debts and credits. During Bock&#x27;s stay in Goa the following winter, his assets were confiscated and his properties sold.

====Hoard of the Kajaani castle====
Another location of Bock&#x27;s stories was the early 17th century stone fort in Kajaani. According to Bock, a castle was present there already in the 13th century, when a royal treasure of kings of Finland, including a golden buck statue, was hidden in a well in the courtyard of the castle. Some excitement arose when ground-penetrating radar investigations made in 1996 and 2000 suggested that a sizable metal item was located at 4 meters depth of the courtyard of the fort. According to the state archaeologist Henrik Lilius the item was probably an old cannon that could have fallen into the well during the destruction of the fort in 1716. A new investigation made in 2006 was not able to verify the earlier observations. During an archaeological excavation made later in 2006, it was noticed that an electric ground cable had been dug in the courtyard at 40 cm depth. According to the project manager Selja Flink of the National Board of Antiquities, it was most probably the object noticed in the ground-penetrating radar investigations. According to Flink, there is no archaeological or documentary evidence of the well mentioned by Bock.

===Death===
On 23 October 2010, Bock was stabbed to death in his apartment in Helsinki. Police arrested two men, Indian nationals aged 19 and 28, who had shared his apartment and had worked as his personal assistants.

The younger suspect was subsequently set free and cleared of all charges. The 28-year-old was found not culpable by reason of insanity and in 2011 he was deported to India.

==Outline of the Bock Saga==

At her funeral on 23 June 1984, Ior claimed that his mother Rhea (Boxström-Svedlin) had left him a very specific duty, confirmed in her will; to bring their ancient and unknown family-saga to the attention of professional historians as well as the public. The first recordings were done in Swedish in 1984 and 1985 at The Archive of Folklore in Helsinki. Later he gave further outlines and specifics in numerous tapes and in 1996 the Finnish writer Juha Javanainen collected some basic extracts in the book &quot;Bockin Perheen Saga&quot; (Helsinki, 1996).

In his saga, Bock employs a distinct etymology, based on the letters of the Scandinavian alphabets (Swedish and Finnish language). To support his (allegedly) historical saga he related it to old Scandinavian folklore, describing a nucleus that is supposed to be the origin of both the Scandinavian and the Finnish cultures. The saga describes a detailed sound system, built on the sounds of the Scandinavian alphabet. Based on this phonology the saga explains an extensive mythology and a chronological, stringent history. The &quot;historical outline&quot; covers a number of topics; from the origin of man before Ice Age and a global caste-system, to the breakup of this global population due to the appearance of the Ice Age, climatic fluctuations and continental drift. The saga explains how this first, tropical culture was divided into ten different kingdoms as life on each continents developed into parallel but different biotops. During the eons of time when ice time proceeded a small group of people, the Aser, who were caught inside the ice of northern Europe – inside the Baltic Ocean. The end of Ice Age broke this isolation and became a &quot;new start&quot; of humanity since all the various populations could now be reached – and reach each other. Regaining contact with the various tropical kingdoms the Aser were instrumental in spreading a &quot;root-system&quot; of words, to develop a common ground for communication and exchange between the various cultures. Since the legendary &quot;deluge&quot; (Younger Dryas) 10,000 years ago, the connections rapidly established and similar cultures started on all the different continents, leading to parallel cultures on the respective continents, leading to the ethnicities, constitutions and civilizations we know as Stone Age and Classical Antiquity.

During these millennia, the Asers were drafting and cultivating their intercontinental connections, enhancing the exchange of knowledge, skills and produce worldwide. The purpose was to produce common features and grounds for language and culture, through the exchange of procreators, skills, crafts, arts and architecture. Their method was co-operation between parallel constitutions of royals, nobilities and laymen. According to the saga the Eurasian monarchies were established shortly after the Ice Age. From the one arctic group of people that survived Ice Age, called &quot;Aser&quot;, only three families were first made to explore the Eurasian north – and leave offspring in their respective regions; east, west and south of the Baltic Ocean. These offspring became the core-families of three major kingdoms, who managed to grow into the societies that managed to populate western, central and eastern Europe. Within the open lands of northern Eurasia, the royals were producing &#x27;houses&#x27; of nobility to inhabit and populate the various regions and there found a third cast of offspring, called Earls, to produce structured societies within their respective shires and villages.

The Bock saga explains that the historical kingdoms of Eurasia descended from the three kingdoms found by the Aser already during early Stone Age. Similar constitutions are claimed to have existed already in the southern hemisphere, on all other continents. Since the ancestry of all these tropical and arctic royals would lead back to a common source, the word &quot;All-father&quot; was recognized by them all as a common origin of all human beings. Thus the renewed contact and resurrection of common roots and goals resulted in a positive contact and exchange, producing a worldwide net of genetic and academic exchange – leading to the innovations, produce and trade of agriculture, metals and alloys that led to advanced arts, tools, craft and technology.

A major theme in the poetry and prose of the Bock saga is the exposure of the ancient fertility cultures of antiquity, whose legal traditions – based on inheritance – where contradictory to the interest of foreign invaders and illegal regimes. Consequently, to handle an occupied population, the religions of the Middle Ages exercised an absolute repression of all the old fertility rituals, since they required and recreated the memory of the old codexes. Consequently, the heathen traditions of sexual visibility and identification was massively condemned and sanctioned with the most severe of punishments. One such heathen tradition was that of drinking the &quot;divine vine&quot; or the &quot;water of wisdom&quot;, which literally refers to the female sap (ejaculate) and the male sperm.

According to the saga the pagan traditions were based on a naturalistic philosophy, where it was regarded a virtue to &quot;save and not spill ones semen or female ejaculate&quot;. This could be done by sharing the liquids in a &quot;69&quot; or by practicing autofellatio – which the family-saga names &quot;sauna-solmu&quot;. The Finnish expression for this &quot;sacred vines&quot; would be &quot;Viisauden Vesi&quot;—the water of wisdom, which in other traditions are known under cryptic terms such as &quot;The Water of Life&quot;, &quot;The Seeds of Life&quot;, &quot;The Nectar of The Gods&quot; or &quot;The Elixir of the Blessed&quot;. In the early Christian context these classical issues were mistranslated, to &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;flesh&quot;, to stigmatize the pagan peoples as wild beasts, vampires and cannibals. Paradoxically, the liturgy is still defining &quot;the flesh and blood of Jesus&quot; as our most sacred rite, the communion. Even if the tools of the communion today are explained to be &quot;purely allegorical&quot; their origin are still to be explained. In fact however, origins of the communion are well known, the communion has little in common with mentioned traditions, and in Catholicism it is not allegorical.

While the men would learn how to &quot;curl up&quot; in a &quot;sauna-knot&quot; and drink directly from their &quot;clubs&quot;, the women would normally ingest their &quot;mahla&quot;, female ejaculation, with a straw. According to the Bock Saga this used to be a collective tradition amongst men and women, where &quot;heart-friends&quot; (of the same sex) would share each other&#x27;s liquids as a special favor and sacrament, to enhance their respective fertility and vitalize their neurological energy. The saga claims that within the heathen cultures this recycling of sperm and sap was obligatory at the age of 7, when it was combined with yoga exercises.

==In popular culture==
In 1994, Kingston Wall, a Finnish psychedelic rock group included the core of Bock&#x27;s mythic symbolism on their last album, &quot;Tri-Logy&quot;. The saga was described in the CD booklet, and some of the song lyrics featured themes from it.

<text>Yalta (: ) is a resort city on the south coast of the Crimean Peninsula surrounded by the Black Sea. It serves as the administrative center of Yalta Municipality, one of the regions within Crimea. Yalta, along with the rest of Crimea, is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, and is considered part of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. However, it is under the control of Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and regards the town as part of the Republic of Crimea. According to the most recent census, its population was 

The city is located on the site of the ancient Greek colony of Yalita. It is said to have been founded by the Greek settlers who were looking for a safe shore () on which to land. It is situated on a deep bay facing south towards the Black Sea, surrounded by the mountain range Ai-Petri. It has a humid subtropical climate and is surrounded by numerous vineyards and orchards.

The area became famous when the city held the Yalta Conference as part of the Allied World War II conferences in 1945.

The term &quot;Greater Yalta&quot; is used to designate a part of the Crimean southern coast spanning from Foros in the west to Gurzuf in the east and including the city of Yalta and multiple adjacent urban settlements.

==History==

===12th–19th centuries===

The existence of Yalta was recorded in the 12th century by an Arab geographer, who described it as a Byzantine port and fishing settlement. It became part of a network of Genoese trading colonies on the Crimean coast in the 14th century, when it was known as &quot;Etalita&quot; or &quot;Galita&quot;. Crimea was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1475, which made it a semi-independent subject territory under the rule of the Crimean Khanate but the southern coast with Yalta was under direct Ottoman rule forming the Eyalet of Kefe (Feodosiya). Yalta was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1783, along with the rest of Crimea, sparking the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). Prior to the annexation of the Crimea, the Crimean Greeks were moved to Mariupol in 1778; one of the villages they established nearby is also called Yalta.

In the 19th century, the town became a fashionable resort for the Russian aristocracy and gentry. Leo Tolstoy spent summers there and Anton Chekhov in 1898 bought a house (the White Dacha) here, where he lived until 1902; Yalta is the setting for Chekhov&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Lady with the Dog&quot;, and such prominent plays as &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; were written in Yalta. The town was also closely associated with royalty. In 1889 Tsar Alexander III finished construction of Massandra Palace a short distance to the north of Yalta and Nicholas II built the Livadia Palace southwest of the town in 1911.

===20th century===
During the 20th century, Yalta was the principal holiday resort of the Soviet Union. In 1920, Vladimir Lenin issued a decree &quot;On the Use of Crimea for the Medical Treatment of the Working People&quot; which endorsed the region&#x27;s transformation from a fairly exclusive resort area into a recreation facility for tired proletarians. Numerous workers&#x27; sanatoria were constructed in and around Yalta and the surrounding district. There were, in fact, few other places that Soviet citizens could come for a seaside holiday, as foreign travel was forbidden to all but a handful. The Soviet elite also came to Yalta; the Soviet premier Joseph Stalin used the Massandra Palace as his summer residence.

Yalta was occupied by the German Army from 9 November 1941 to 16 April 1944.

The town came to worldwide attention in 1945 when the Yalta Conference between the &quot;Big Three&quot; powers – the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom – was held at the Livadia Palace.

===21st century===
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Yalta has struggled economically. Many of the &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; of ex-Soviet citizens began going to other European holiday resorts, now that they had the freedom and money to travel; conversely, the impoverishment of many ex-Soviet citizens meant that they could no longer afford to go to Yalta. The town&#x27;s transport links have been significantly reduced with the end of almost all passenger traffic by sea. The longest trolleybus line in Europe goes from the train station in Simferopol to Yalta (almost 90 km). Yalta is crowded in the vacation season (July–August) and prices for accommodation are very high. Most of the tourists are from countries of the former Soviet Union; in 2013, about 12% of tourists to Crimea were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships.

Yalta has a beautiful seafront promenade along the Black Sea. People can be seen strolling there all seasons of the year, and it also serves as a place to gather and talk, to see and be seen. There are several beaches to the east and west of the promenade. Many kinds of pine trees (Stone pine and Aleppo pine for example), oleander shrubs, lemon and olive trees and different sorts of palm trees such as the Chinese windmill palm, the Mexican fan palm and the Canary Island date palm are scattered all over the city. The town has several movie theaters, a drama theater, plenty of restaurants, and several open-air markets.

Two beaches in Yalta are Blue Flag beaches since May 2010, these were the first beaches (with two beaches in Yevpatoria) to be awarded a Blue Flag in a CIS member state.

In 2014, Russia, in violation of international law, invaded Crimea and claimed it as part of Russia.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
As Yalta lies to the south of the Crimean Mountains and within an amphitheatre of hills, the climate is mild. Köppen classifies the city as humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;), bordering on a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;); while the city&#x27;s Trewartha class is oceanic (&quot;Do&quot;), barely missing the criteria for humid subtropical (&quot;Cf&quot;). In February, the average temperature reaches . Snow is infrequent and melts soon thereafter. In July, the average temperature reaches . The average annual precipitation is , most of it being concentrated in the colder months. The sun shines approximately 2,169 hours per year. Since the city is located on the shore of the Black Sea, the weather rarely becomes extremely hot due to the cool sea breezes. The average annual temperature for Yalta is around , which makes it one of the warmest places in Ukraine.

==Demographics==
As of the Ukrainian Census conducted on 1 January 2001, the population of Yalta is 80,500. The main ethnic groups of Yalta are: Russians (65.5%), Ukrainians (25.7%), Belarusians (1.6%), and Crimean Tatars (1.3%). The majority of people speak Russian as their mother tongue.

<text>A caron . or háček ( ), is a diacritic mark () placed over certain letters in the orthography of some languages, to indicate a change of the related letter&#x27;s pronunciation.
Typographers tend to use the term &quot;caron&quot;, while linguists prefer the Czech word &quot;&quot;.

The symbol is common in the Baltic, Slavic, Finnic, Samic and Berber languages.
Its use differs according to the orthographic rules of a language. In most Slavic and other European languages it indicates present or historical palatalization (e → ě; [] → []), iotation, or postalveolar articulation (c → č; → ). In Salishan languages, it often represents a uvular consonant (x → x̌; [] → ). When placed over vowel symbols, the caron can indicate a contour tone, for instance the falling and then rising tone in the Pinyin romanization of Mandarin Chinese. It is also used to decorate symbols in mathematics, where it is often pronounced (&quot;check&quot;).

The caron is shaped approximately like a small letter &quot;v&quot;. For serif typefaces, the caron generally has one of two forms: either symmetrical, essentially identical to an inverted circumflex; or with the left stroke thicker than the right, like the usual serif form of the letter &quot;v&quot; (, but without serifs). The latter form is often preferred by Czech designers for use in Czech, while for other uses the symmetrical form tends to predominate, as it does also among sans-serif typefaces.

The caron is not to be confused with the breve (, which is curved rather than angled):
== Names ==
Different disciplines generally refer to this diacritic mark by different names. Typography tends to use the term caron. Linguistics more often uses the Czech word &#x27;. Pullum&#x27;s and Ladusaw&#x27;s &quot;Phonetic Symbol Guide&quot; uses the term wedge&quot;&quot;&#x27;.

The term &quot;caron&quot; is used in the official names of Unicode characters (e.g., &quot;&quot;). The Unicode Consortium explicitly states that the reason for this is unknown, but its earliest known use was in the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual of 1967, and it was later used in character sets such as DIN 31624 (1979), ISO 5426 (1980), ISO/IEC 6937 (1983) and ISO/IEC 8859-2 (1985). Its actual origin remains obscure, but some have suggested that it may derive from a fusion of caret and macron. Though this may be folk etymology, it is plausible, particularly in the absence of other suggestions. A Unicode technical note states that the name &quot;hacek&quot; should have been used instead.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives 1953 as the earliest appearance in English for . In Czech, () means &#x27;small &#x27;, the diminutive form of (, &#x27;hook&#x27;)&quot;. The name appears in most English dictionaries, but they treat the long mark (acute accent) differently. British dictionaries, such as the &quot;OED&quot;, &quot;ODE&quot;, &quot;CED&quot;, write (with the mark) in the headwords, while American ones, such as the &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;, &quot;NOAD&quot;, &quot;AHD&quot;, incorrectly omit the acute and write , however, the &quot;NOAD&quot; gives as an alternative spelling.

In Slovak it is called (, i.e., &#x27;softener&#x27; or &#x27;palatalization mark&#x27;), in Serbo-Croatian or (&#x27;angled hook&#x27; or &#x27;small angled hook&#x27;), in Slovenian (&#x27;little roof&#x27;) or (&#x27;little hook&#x27;), in Lithuanian (&#x27;little bird&#x27;) or (&#x27;little jackdaw&#x27;), in Estonian (&#x27;roof&#x27;), in Finnish (&#x27;hat&#x27;), and in Lakota (&#x27;wedge&#x27;).

The caron evolved from the dot above diacritic, which Jan Hus introduced into Czech orthography (along with the acute accent) in his &quot;De Orthographia Bohemica&quot; (1412). The original form still exists in Polish &quot;ż&quot;. However, Hus&#x27;s work was hardly known at that time, and &quot;háček&quot; became widespread only in the 16th century with the introduction of printing.

== Usage ==
For the fricatives &quot;š&quot; , &quot;ž&quot; , and the affricate &quot;č&quot; only, the caron is used in most northwestern Uralic languages that use the Latin alphabet, such as Karelian, Veps, Northern Sami, and Inari Sami (although not in Southern Sami). Estonian and Finnish use &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot; (but not &quot;č&quot;), but only for transcribing foreign names and loanwords (albeit common loanwords such as or &#x27;check&#x27;); the sounds (and letters) are native and common in Karelian, Veps, and Sami.

In Italian, &quot;š&quot;, &quot;ž&quot;, and &quot;č&quot; are routinely used as in Slovenian to transcribe Slavic names in the Cyrillic script since in native Italian words, the sounds represented by these letters must be followed by a vowel, and Italian uses &quot;ch&quot; for , not . Other Romance languages, by contrast, tend to use their own orthographies, or in a few cases such as Spanish, borrow English &quot;sh&quot; or &quot;zh&quot;.

The caron is also used in the Romany alphabet. The Faggin-Nazzi writing system for Friulian makes use of the caron over the letters &quot;c&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, and &quot;s&quot;.

The caron is also often used as a diacritical mark on consonants for romanization of text from non-Latin writing systems, particularly in the scientific transliteration of Slavic languages. Philologists and the standard Finnish orthography often prefer using it to express sounds for which English require a digraph (&quot;sh, ch&quot;, and &quot;zh&quot;) because most Slavic languages use only one character to spell the sounds (the key exceptions are Polish &quot;sz&quot; and &quot;cz&quot;). Its use for that purpose can even be found in the United States because certain atlases use it in romanization of foreign place names. On the typographical side, Š/š and Ž/ž are likely the easiest among non-Western European diacritic characters to adopt for Westerners because the two are part of the Windows-1252 character encoding.

Esperanto uses the circumflex over &quot;c&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, and &quot;s&quot; in similar ways; the circumflex was chosen because there was no caron on most Western European typewriters, but the circumflex existed on French ones.

It is also used as an accent mark on vowels to indicate the tone of a syllable. The main example is in Pinyin for Chinese in which it represents a falling-rising tone. It is used in transliterations of Thai to indicate a rising tone.

=== Phonetics ===
The caron represents a rising tone in the International Phonetic Alphabet. It is used in the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet for indicating postalveolar consonants and in Americanist phonetic notation to indicate various types of pronunciation.

The caron below represents voicing.

=== Writing and printing carons ===
In printed Czech and Slovak text, the caron combined with certain letters (lower-case ť, ď, ľ, and upper-case Ľ) is reduced to a small stroke. That is optional in handwritten text. Latin fonts are typically set to display this way by default. In some applications, using the combining grapheme joiner, U+034F, between the letter and the combining mark, as in t͏̌, d͏̌, l͏̌, may prevent the caron from looking like a small stroke of the canonical characters.

In Lazuri orthography, the lower-case &quot;k&quot; with caron sometimes has its caron reduced to a stroke while the lower-case &quot;t&quot; with caron preserves its caron shape.

Although the stroke looks similar to an apostrophe, the kerning is significantly different. Using an apostrophe in place of a caron can be perceived as very unprofessional, but it is still often found on imported goods meant for sale in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (compare t’ to ť, L’ahko to Ľahko). (Apostrophes appearing as palatalization marks in some Finnic languages, such as Võro and Karelian, are not forms of caron either.) Foreigners also sometimes mistake the caron for the acute accent (compare Ĺ to Ľ, ĺ to ľ).

=== In Balto-Slavic languages ===
The following are the Czech and Slovak letters and digraphs with the caron (Czech: , Slovak: ):
* Č/č (pronounced , similar to &#x27;ch&#x27; in &quot;cheap&quot;: , which means Czech Republic)
* Š/š (pronounced , similar to &#x27;sh&#x27; in &quot;she&quot;: in )
* Ž/ž (pronounced , similar to &#x27;s&#x27; in &quot;treasure&quot;: &#x27;sorrow&#x27;)
* Ř/ř (only in Czech: a special voiced or unvoiced fricative trill or , the former transcribed as in pre-1989 IPA: Antonín Dvořák )
* Ď/ď, Ť/ť, Ň/ň (palatals, pronounced , , , slightly different from palatalized consonants as found in Russian): , &#x27;The Devil and a beheaded horse&#x27;)
* Ľ/ľ (only in Slovak, pronounced as palatal : , &#x27;businessman&#x27;)
* DŽ/Dž/dž (considered a single letter in Slovak, Macedonian, and Serbo-Croatian, two letters in Czech, pronounced &quot;jungle&quot; - identical to the &quot;j&quot; sound in &quot;jungle&quot; and the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;genius&quot;, found mostly in borrowings.)
* Ě/ě (only in Czech) indicates mostly palatalization of preceding consonant: 
** , , are , , ; 
** but is or , and , , , are .
* Furthermore, until the 19th century, Ǧ/ǧ was used to represent while G/g was used to represent .

In Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian, the following letters and digraphs have the caron:
* Č/č (pronounced like &#x27;ch&#x27; in &quot;cheap&quot;)
* Š/š (pronounced like &#x27;sh&#x27; in &quot;she&quot;)
* Ž/ž (pronounced like &#x27;s&#x27; in &quot;treasure&quot;)
* Ř/ř (only in Upper Sorbian: pronounced like &#x27;sh&#x27; in &quot;she&quot;)
* Tř/tř (digraph, only in Upper Sorbian, soft (palatalized) sound)
* Ě/ě (pronounced like &#x27;e&#x27; in &quot;bed&quot;)

Balto-Slavic Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, Latvian and Lithuanian use č, š and ž. The digraph dž is also used in these languages but is considered a separate letter only in Serbo-Croatian. The Belarusian Lacinka alphabet also contains the digraph dž (as a separate letter), and Latin transcriptions of Bulgarian and Macedonian may use them at times, for transcription of the letter-combination ДЖ (Bulgarian) and the letter Џ (Macedonian).

===In Uralic languages===
In the Finnic languages, Estonian (and transcriptions to Finnish) uses Š/š and Ž/ž, and Karelian uses Č/č, Š/š and Ž/ž. Dž is not a separate letter. Č is present because it may be phonemically geminate: in Karelian, the phoneme &#x27;čč&#x27; is found, and is distinct from &#x27;č&#x27;, which is not the case in Finnish or Estonian, for which only one length is recognized for &#x27;tš&#x27;. (Incidentally, in transcriptions, Finnish orthography has to employ complicated notations like or even the to express Karelian .) On some Finnish keyboards, it is possible to write those letters by typing &quot;s&quot; or &quot;z&quot; while holding right Alt key or AltGr key, though that is not supported by the Microsoft Windows keyboard device driver KBDFI.DLL for the Finnish language. The Finnish multilingual keyboard layout allows typing the letters Š/š and Ž/ž by pressing AltGr+&#x27;+S for š and AltGr+&#x27;+Z for ž.

In Estonian, Finnish and Karelian these are &quot;not&quot; palatalized but postalveolar consonants. For example, Estonian (palatalized) is distinct from (postalveolar). Palatalization is typically ignored in spelling, but some Karelian and Võro orthographies use an apostrophe (&#x27;) or an acute accent (´). In Finnish and Estonian, &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot; (and in Estonian, very rarely &quot;č&quot;) appear in loanwords and foreign proper names only and when not available, they can be substituted with &#x27;h&#x27;: &#x27;sh&#x27; for &#x27;š&#x27;, in print.

In the orthographies of the Sami languages, the letters Č/č, Š/š and Ž/ž appear in Northern Sami, Inari Sami and Skolt Sami. Skolt Sami also uses three other consonants with the caron: Ǯ/ǯ (ezh-caron) to mark the voiced postalveolar affricate (plain Ʒ/ʒ marks the alveolar affricate ), Ǧ/ǧ to mark the voiced palatal affricate and Ǩ/ǩ the corresponding voiceless palatal affricate . More often than not, they are geminated: &quot;vuäǯǯad&quot; &quot;to get&quot;. The orthographies of the more southern Sami languages of Sweden and Norway such as Lule Sami do not use caron, and prefer instead the digraphs &quot;tj&quot; and &quot;sj&quot;.

==== Finno-Ugric transcription ====
Most other Uralic languages (including Kildin Sami) are normally written with Cyrillic instead of the Latin script. In their scientific transcription, the Finno-Ugric Transcription / Uralic Phonetic Alphabet however employs the letters &quot;š&quot;, &quot;ž&quot; and occasionally &quot;č&quot;, &quot;ǯ&quot; (alternately &quot;tš&quot;, &quot;dž&quot;) for the postalveolar consonants. These serve as basic letters, and with further diacritics are used to transcribe also other fricative and affricate sounds. Retroflex consonants are marked by a caron and an underdot (&quot;ṣ̌&quot;, &quot;ẓ̌&quot; = IPA , ), alveolo-palatal (palatalized postalveolar) consonants by a caron and an acute (&quot;š́&quot;, &quot;ž́&quot; = IPA , ). Thus, for example, the postalveolar consonants of the Udmurt language, normally written as Ж/ж, Ӝ/ӝ, Ӵ/ӵ, Ш/ш are in Uralic studies normally transcribed as &quot;ž&quot;, &quot;ǯ&quot;, &quot;č&quot;, &quot;š&quot; respectively, and the alveolo-palatal consonants normally written as Зь/зь, Ӟ/ӟ, Сь/сь, Ч/ч are normally transcribed as &quot;ž́&quot;, &quot;ǯ́&quot;, &quot;š́&quot;, &quot;č́&quot; respectively.

===In other languages===

In the Berber Latin alphabet of the Berber language (North Africa) the following letters and digraphs are used with the caron:

* Č/č (pronounced like the English &quot;ch&quot; in China)
* Ǧ/ǧ (pronounced like the English &quot;j&quot; in the words &quot;joke&quot; and &quot;James&quot;)
* Ř/ř (only in Riffian Berber: pronounced ) (no English equivalent).

Finnish Kalo uses Ȟ/ȟ.

Lakota uses Č/č, Š/š, Ž/ž, Ǧ/ǧ (voiced post-velar fricative) and Ȟ/ȟ (plain post-velar fricative).

Indonesian uses ě (e with caron) informally to mark the schwa ().

Many alphabets of African languages use the caron to mark the rising tone, as in the African reference alphabet.

Outside of the Latin alphabet, the caron is also used for Cypriot Greek letters that have a different sound from Standard Modern Greek: σ̌ κ̌ π̌ τ̌ ζ̌ in words like (&#x27;and&#x27;), (&#x27;cat&#x27;).

=== Other transcription and transliteration systems ===

The DIN 31635 standard for transliteration of Arabic uses Ǧ/ǧ to represent the letter . &quot;&quot;, on account of the inconsistent pronunciation of J in European languages, the variable pronunciation of the letter in educated Arabic , and the desire of the DIN committee to have a one-to-one correspondence of Arabic to Latin letters in its system.

Romanization of Pashto uses Č/č, Š/š, Ž/ž, X̌/x̌, to represent the letters ‎چ‎, ‎ش‎, ‎ژ‎, ‎ښ‎, respectively. Additionally, Ṣ̌/ṣ̌ and Ẓ̌/ẓ̌ are used by the southern Pashto dialect only (replaced by X̌/x̌ and Ǵ/ǵ in the north). 

The latter Š/š is also used to transcribe the phoneme in Sumerian and Akkadian cuneiform, and the phoneme in Semitic languages represented by the letter shin (Phoenician and its descendants).

The caron is also used in Mandarin Chinese pinyin romanization and orthographies of several other tonal languages to indicate the &quot;falling-rising&quot; tone (similar to the pitch made when asking &quot;Huh?&quot;). The caron can be placed over the vowels: ǎ, ě, ǐ, ǒ, ǔ, ǚ. The alternative to a caron is a number 3 after the syllable: = , as the &quot;falling-rising&quot; tone is the third tone in Mandarin.

The caron is used in the New Transliteration System of D&#x27;ni in the symbol š to represent the sound (English &quot;sh&quot;).

A-caron (ǎ) is also used to transliterate the Cyrillic letter Ъ () in Bulgarian—it represents the mid back unrounded vowel .

Caron marks a falling and rising tone (bǔ, bǐ) in Fon languages.

==Letters with caron==
Unicode encodes a number of cases of &quot;letter with caron&quot; as precomposed characters and these are displayed below. In addition, many more symbols may be composed using the combining character facility ( and ) that may be used with any letter or other diacritic to create a customised symbol but this does not mean that the result has any real-world application and are not shown in the table. 

There are a number of Cyrillic letters with caron but they do not have precomposed characters and thus must be generated using the combining character method. These are: В̌в̌; Ǯǯ; Г̌г̌; Ғ̌ғ̌; Д̌д̌; З̌з̌; Р̌р̌; Т̌т̌; Х̌х̌

== Software ==

=== Unicode ===
For legacy reasons, most letters that carry carons are precomposed characters in Unicode, but a caron can also be added to any letter by using the combining character , for example: b̌ q̌ J̌.

The characters Č, č, Ě, ě, Š, š, Ž, ž are a part of the Unicode Latin Extended-A set because they occur in Czech and other official languages in Europe, while the rest are in Latin Extended-B, which often causes an inconsistent appearance.

Unicode also encodes , for example: p̬.

A combining double caron was proposed for inclusion in April, 2024.

<text>The Battle of Wisternitz or Dolní Věstonice was fought on 5 August 1619 between a Moravian force of the Bohemian Confederation under Friedrich von Tiefenbach (Teuffenbach) and a Habsburg army under Henri de Dampierre. The battle was a Moravian victory. The battle is part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Budweis (České Budějovice) was one of the three towns which remained loyal to King Ferdinand of House Habsburg when Bohemia revolted. After the Habsburg victory at Sablat, the Bohemians were forced to raise the siege of České Budějovice. On 15 June 1619, Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim retreated to Soběslav where he awaited reinforcement by Count Heinrich Matthias von Thurn.

After taking control of the strong places of southern Bohemia, Ferdinand sent a force under Dampierre to Moravia, which had chosen the side of the Bohemian rebels. However, Dampierre was defeated at Dolní Věstonice () by Moravian forces under von Tiefenbach (brother of Rudolf von Tiefenbach) and Ladislav Velen ze Žerotína in August 1619, which left Moravia in the Bohemian camp.

<text>Greenville University is a private university in Greenville, Illinois, United States. It is affiliated with the Free Methodist Church. Established as Greenville College in 1892, the institution was renamed Greenville University in 2017.

==History==
In 1855, Stephen Morse and Almira Blanchard founded a college for women, Almira College, which shared an affiliation with the Baptist Church and educated young women, until a change in leadership, affiliation, and organization in 1892. At that time, the Central Illinois Conference of the Free Methodist Church purchased the property of Almira College and named it Greenville College. The institution was restructured to offer a co-educational experience. The institution was also incorporated as an independent college under the leadership of the Free Methodist Church. Greenville College was renamed to Greenville University in 2017.

==Code of conduct==
Students attending Greenville University are expected to adhere to a lifestyle that is codified and asks that the student agree to certain principles that the school calls &quot;Christ-honoring&quot;, outlined in a document known as the Lifestyle Statement. Violations of the lifestyle statement are handled through a grace-based system which seeks to help students recover from any negative effects (i.e. addiction, emotional distress) and rehabilitate them to live according to what they believe is Christ&#x27;s purpose for their life.

The Lifestyle Statement exists to keep the GU community accountable for having a healthy lifestyle that keeps the individual in line with God&#x27;s redemptive plan. It includes instructions for all students to avoid: &quot;backbiting, cheating, dishonesty, drunkenness, gossip, immodesty of dress, lying, occult practices, profanity, sexual promiscuity (including adultery, homosexual behavior, pre-marital sex), theft, and vulgarity (including crude language).&quot; Other actions that students must agree to refrain from, both while on and away from campus, include: &quot;the use of tobacco in any form, alcoholic beverages, hallucinogenic drugs and substances (including marijuana), or narcotics not authorized by a physician&quot;, gambling, and using or possessing pornography. And, in keeping with the institution&#x27;s focus on Christian principles, the document states: &quot;Members of the community are to observe the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday) as a day set apart primarily for worship, fellowship, ministry, and rest.&quot; These principles are set in place to hold students accountable for creating a learning environment that intends to stands out from other universities and offer unique benefits to the health and well-being of the student. Greenville University states that it is committed to providing support without judgment to anyone suffering from any kind of problem, addiction, or mental illness. Struggling students are often encouraged to receive counseling or meet with a mentor in order to provide professional support as they attempt to make lifestyle changes.

Undergraduate students are not required to sign a statement of faith; however, they must fulfill at least 10 chapel credits each semester. Most of these credits are fulfilled by attending a chapel service that is available on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of every academic week at 9:30am.

==Campus==
Nearly 800 students live on campus in a variety of residence halls including Joy Hall, Janssen Hall, Burritt Hall, Holtwick Hall, Blakenship Apartments, Tenney Hall, Kinney Hall, and Ellen J. Mannoia Hall (formerly known as College Avenue Hall). An additional 101-bed dormitory, called Hood Hall (formerly known as West Oak Hall), opened in the fall of 2007. Students also live in a number of college-owned houses. In the summer of 2007, Janssen Hall (originally constructed in 1959) was gutted and completely updated and remodeled. Joy Hall was renovated in the summer of 2011 to bring it up to modern safety code.

The college is home to the only museum dedicated to the works of sculptor Richard Bock, an associate of Frank Lloyd Wright. The first classes of Almira College in the 1850s were held in John Brown White&#x27;s home, which is called the Almira College House; it houses Bock&#x27;s sculptures.

In 1999, under the leadership of President Mannoia, the college became the first campus in the nation to install a completely wireless internet network across the entire campus.

===Hogue Hall===


The previous oldest building on campus, Wilson T. Hogue Hall, originally housed Almira College. Bricks for the building were made on the front campus in 1855, and the building was erected between 1856 and 1864 and given the name &quot;Old Main&quot;. Hogue Hall contained the data processing center and administrative offices of the college on the lower two floors. The upper two floors, originally dormitory rooms, provided offices for the faculty and a few small classrooms. Informal conversation between faculty and students frequently took place in these offices. An open &quot;bridge&quot; at the third-floor level led to the third floor of LaDue Auditorium and Marston Hall, which serves as the main classroom building. This building was part of the National Register of Historic Places.

In the spring of 2007, then-President Vincent James Mannoia was made aware of structural problems within Hogue Hall that led to a remodeling project in the building. In the summer of 2007, remodeling work on the lower floor found significant cracks in the timber holding up the masonry wall. When it became aware of the situation, the college stopped the remodeling and consulted with a structural engineer and architectural experts on old buildings for advice. These experts&#x27; initial inspection uncovered major structural concerns in the east wing of the historic building. Classes were moved from the four classrooms on the third floor of the building, and faculty with offices located in the east wing were relocated to the classrooms. After extensive consultation with local citizens, faculty, staff, alumni, and the board of trustees, President Mannoia determined that Hogue Hall should be torn down in the summer of 2008, despite objections from Illinois&#x27; state preservation agency. The site of Hogue Hall is now contains Hogue Tower Memorial, a tower recreated in the shape of a tower that used to stand center of Hogue Hall. Original plans were to rebuild a new Hogue Hall in the same location, the college board of trustees is deciding whether to rebuild it in another location.

==Athletics==
Greenville University teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Panthers are a member of the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SLIAC). The Panthers also compete in the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, gymnastics, soccer, tennis, track and field, and volleyball, while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, gymnastics, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Club programs include bass fishing, cheer, dance, and esports. The football team participates in the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference and gymnastics teams participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference. Greenville added men&#x27;s volleyball in the 2015–16 school year (2016 season); since the SLIAC only sponsors volleyball for women, that team will compete in the Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League.

Greenville&#x27;s football team won the Victory Bowl, the NCCAA national championship game, in 2012 and have been the National Runner-up in 2000, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2019. The men&#x27;s indoor track and field team has won four NCCAA national championships, in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, while the men&#x27;s outdoor track and field team has won six NCCAA national championships, in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. The GU women&#x27;s basketball team won the NCCAA national championship in 2017.

==Faculty==
1956 Prohibition Party candidate for President of the United States, Enoch A. Holtwick, was a professor of history and government at Greenville College and is honored at GU through the Enoch A. Holtwick Literary Award and Enoch A. Holtwick Hall, a residence building.

GU professor Richard Huston became a Fulbright scholar for the third time in July 2007. He spent a year lecturing at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua in Leon, Nicaragua, beginning in February 2008.

Greenville University depends heavily on full-time faculty as the foundation for its educational program, particularly in the four-year traditional undergraduate programs. In the spring of 2009, 69 full-time faculty were employed at the school.

According to the Faculty Handbook, full-time faculty are reviewed regularly in their second, fourth, and sixth years of employment. For those faculty on the tenure track, the sixth year review is usually a tenure review. Post-tenure reviews occur every seven years. In each review, teaching and professional growth are evaluated. Faculty are also evaluated in at least one other area: scholarship, service, and/or governance. Greenville University says the review process is based on its published standards and what it calls its commitment to excellence in teaching.

<text>A calcium–aluminium-rich inclusion or Ca–Al-rich inclusion (CAI) is a submillimeter- to centimeter-sized light-colored calcium- and aluminium-rich inclusion found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The four CAIs that have been dated using the Pb-Pb chronometer yield a weighted mean age of 4567.30 ± 0.16 Myr. As CAIs are the oldest dated solids, this age is commonly used to define the age of the Solar System.

==Description==
CAIs consist of minerals that are among the first solids condensed from the cooling protoplanetary disk. They are thought to have formed as fine-grained condensates from a high temperature (&gt;1300 K) gas that existed in the protoplanetary disk at early stages of Solar System formations. Some of them were probably remelted later resulting in distinct coarser textures. The most common and characteristic minerals in CAIs include anorthite, melilite, perovskite, aluminous spinel, hibonite, calcic pyroxene, and forsterite-rich olivine.

Using the lead-lead isotope chronometer (‘Pb–Pb dating’), the absolute age of four CAIs have been calculated. They yield a weighted mean age of 4567.30 ± 0.16 Myr, which is often interpreted as representing the beginning of the formation of the planetary system (so-called ‘CAI time-zero). It is of note that all four Pb-Pb dated CAIs come from the same group of meteorite (CV chondrites).

<doc id="236567" wikidata="Q2589609" url="?curid=236567" title="Haken manifold">
<text>In mathematics, a Haken manifold is a compact, P²-irreducible 3-manifold that is sufficiently large, meaning that it contains a properly embedded two-sided incompressible surface. Sometimes one considers only orientable Haken manifolds, in which case a Haken manifold is a compact, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold that contains an orientable, incompressible surface.

A 3-manifold finitely covered by a Haken manifold is said to be virtually Haken. The Virtually Haken conjecture asserts that every compact, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is virtually Haken. This conjecture was proven by Ian Agol.

Haken manifolds were introduced by . proved that Haken manifolds have a hierarchy, where they can be split up into 3-balls along incompressible surfaces. Haken also showed that there was a finite procedure to find an incompressible surface if the 3-manifold had one. gave an algorithm to determine if a 3-manifold was Haken.

Normal surfaces are ubiquitous in the theory of Haken manifolds and their simple and rigid structure leads quite naturally to algorithms.

==Haken hierarchy==
We will consider only the case of orientable Haken manifolds, as this simplifies the discussion; a regular neighborhood of an orientable surface in an orientable 3-manifold is just a &quot;thickened up&quot; version of the surface, i.e., a trivial &quot;I&quot;-bundle. So the regular neighborhood is a 3-dimensional submanifold with boundary containing two copies of the surface.

Given an orientable Haken manifold &quot;M&quot;, by definition it contains an orientable, incompressible surface &quot;S&quot;. Take the regular neighborhood of &quot;S&quot; and delete its interior from &quot;M&quot;, resulting in &quot;M&#x27; &quot;. In effect, we&#x27;ve cut &quot;M&quot; along the surface &quot;S&quot;. (This is analogous, in one less dimension, to cutting a surface along a circle or arc.) It is a theorem that any orientable compact manifold with a boundary component that is not a sphere has an infinite first homology group, which implies that it has a properly embedded 2-sided non-separating incompressible surface, and so is again a Haken manifold. Thus, we can pick another incompressible surface in &quot;M&#x27; &quot;, and cut along that. If eventually this sequence of cutting results in a manifold whose pieces (or components) are just 3-balls, we call this sequence a hierarchy.

==Applications==
The hierarchy makes proving certain kinds of theorems about Haken manifolds a matter of induction. One proves the theorem for 3-balls. Then one proves that if the theorem is true for pieces resulting from a cutting of a Haken manifold, then it is true for that Haken manifold. The key here is that the cutting takes place along a surface that was very &quot;nice&quot;, i.e., incompressible. This makes proving the induction step feasible in many cases.

Haken sketched out a proof of an algorithm to check if two Haken manifolds were homeomorphic or not. His outline was filled in by substantive efforts by Friedhelm Waldhausen, Klaus Johannson, Geoffrey Hemion, Sergeĭ Matveev, et al. Since there is an algorithm to check if a 3-manifold is Haken (cf. Jaco–Oertel), the basic problem of recognition of 3-manifolds can be considered to be solved for Haken manifolds.

 proved that closed Haken manifolds are topologically rigid: roughly, any homotopy equivalence of Haken manifolds is homotopic to a homeomorphism (for the case of boundary, a condition on peripheral structure is needed). So these three-manifolds are completely determined by their fundamental group. In addition, Waldhausen proved that the fundamental groups of Haken manifolds have solvable word problem; this is also true for virtually Haken manifolds.

The hierarchy played a crucial role in William Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds, part of his revolutionary geometrization program for 3-manifolds.

 proved that atoroidal, anannular, boundary-irreducible, Haken three-manifolds have finite mapping class groups. This result can be recovered from the combination of Mostow rigidity with Thurston&#x27;s geometrization theorem.

==Examples of Haken manifolds==
Note that some families of examples are contained in others.

*Compact, irreducible 3-manifolds with positive first Betti number
*Surface bundles over the circle, this is a special case of the example above.
*Link complements, cf. also knot complements.
*Most Seifert fiber spaces have many incompressible tori

<text>The Black Tulip is a historical novel and a work of Romantic poetry written by Alexandre Dumas, père, and first published in 1850.

==Story==

The story begins in 1672, with a historic event: the lynching of the Dutch Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis, considered rebels against the upcoming stadtholder and the Prince of Orange, William III.

The plot takes place while tulip mania grips the Netherlands. The main fictional character, Cornelius Van Baerle, belongs to the natural school whose motto was: &quot;To despise flowers is to offend God&quot;, and thus followed the syllogism:
&quot;To despise flowers is to offend God,
The more beautiful the flower is, the more does one offend God in despising it,
The tulip is the most beautiful of all flowers,
Therefore, he who despises the tulip offends God beyond measure&quot;. (p. 46, The Black Tulip)
The city of Haarlem has offered a prize of 100,000 francs to whoever can grow a black tulip. At stake was not only the prize, but fame and honour; the winner would also have his name included in that given to the tulip itself.

The prosperous Cornelius Van Baerle, godson of Cornelius de Witt, is known in his locale for the growing of tulips and he takes up the challenge to grow a black tulip. His neighbour, Isaac Boxtel who is also a gardener, watches his every move and fearing Cornelius&#x27; success, starts plotting. Boxtel, motivated by envy, denounces Van Baerle because of his relation to the brothers De Witt who are both now considered traitors.

Van Baerle is arrested and condemned to a life sentence in prison. Religious beliefs are used in the narrative for dramatic effect and also words such as &quot;Fate&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;Misfortune&quot;. Misfortune plays a major influence throughout the events of Van Baerle&#x27;s life, but at the end turns out to be a major act of Providence, showing that God is always in control, both in sadness as in happiness.

In prison, Van Baerle meets the beautiful daughter of the jailer, Rosa Gryphus. Cornelius loses everything but had kept the bulbs of the tulips, which were expected to have black flowers. In the midst of loss and sorrow, Rosa helps him to grow the flower in the jail. His affection for Rosa (who is depicted as brave and virtuous) gives him courage to not give up his dreams.

The philosophy of the book is summed up in the quote &quot;Sometimes one has suffered so much that he has the right never to be able to say, ‘I am too happy.’&quot; (p. 204 &quot;The Black Tulip&quot;).

The novel was originally published in three volumes in 1850 as &quot;La Tulipe Noire&quot; by Baudry (Paris). &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, also by Dumas, has similar themes of love, revenge and faith.

==Reception==

George Saintsbury described the novel as &quot;charming in parts&quot;, but felt that Dumas had spun the story out to &quot;an unconscionable length&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
The first screen adaptation appears to have been a silent 1921 Dutch-UK co-production directed by Maurits Binger and Frank Richardson. Alex Bryce directed a well-regarded UK adaptation of the novel in 1937, with Patrick Waddington as Cornelius Van Baerle. A five-part BBC miniseries debuted in August 1956 with Douglas Wilmer in the lead role. A second British miniseries appeared in September 1970. In 1988, Australia&#x27;s Burbank production company created a 50-minute children&#x27;s animated film from a bowdlerised version of the story.

A musical adaptation was written in 2004 by Kit Goldstein, and premiered at Union College in February 2005.

<doc id="236572" wikidata="Q320902" url="?curid=236572" title="Quintus Hortensius">
<text>Quintus Hortensius Hortalus (114–50 BC) was a Roman lawyer, an orator and a statesman. Politically he belonged to the Optimates. He was consul in 69 BC alongside Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus. His nickname was &quot;Dionysia&quot;, after a famous actress. After his retirement Hortensius took up fish-breeding as a hobby. Cicero spoke of him as a &quot;Piscinarius&quot; – &#x27;fish fancier&#x27;.

==Biography==

At the age of nineteen he made his first speech at the bar and shortly afterwards successfully defended Nicomedes III or IV of Bithynia, one of Rome&#x27;s dependants in the East, who had been deprived of his throne by his brother. From that time his reputation as an advocate was established. Through his marriage to Lutatia, daughter of Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Servilia, he was attached to the aristocratic party, the &quot;optimates&quot;. During and after Lucius Cornelius Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship the courts of law were under the control of the Senate, the judges themselves being senators.

To this circumstance perhaps, as well as to his own merits, Hortensius may have been indebted for much of his success. Many of his clients were the governors of provinces which they were accused of having plundered. Such men were sure to find themselves brought before a friendly, not to say a corrupt, tribunal, and Hortensius, according to Cicero was not ashamed to avail himself of this advantage. Having served during two campaigns (in 90 and 89 BC) in the Social War, he served as &quot;quaestor&quot; in 81, &quot;aedile&quot; in 75, &quot;praetor&quot; in 72, and &quot;consul&quot; in 69. In the year before his consulship he came into collision with Cicero in the case of Gaius Verres, and from that time his supremacy at the bar was lost.

After 63, Cicero gravitated towards the faction to which Hortensius belonged. Consequently, in political cases, the two men were often engaged on the same side (e.g., in defence of Gaius Rabirius, Lucius Licinius Murena, Publius Cornelius Sulla, and Titus Annius Milo). After Pompey&#x27;s return from the East in 61, Hortensius withdrew from public life and devoted himself to his profession. He may have assisted Cicero in the defence of against a charge of electoral malpractice () in 54 BCE: Cicero mentions him in his speech, the , but Hortensius&#x27;s relationship to the case is uncertain.

He owned the Villa della Palombara near Rome and another in Gaeta.

In 56, Hortensius admired Cato the Younger &quot;so much that he wanted them to be kinsmen, not merely friends,&quot; and proposed to marry Cato&#x27;s daughter, Porcia Catonis, who was only about 20 years old at the time. Since Porcia was already married to Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus and had borne him children, Cato refused to dissolve the marriage. Instead, Cato offered his own wife, Marcia, on the condition that Marcia&#x27;s father, Lucius Marcius Philippus, approve as well. Consent was obtained and Cato divorced Marcia, thereby placing her under her father&#x27;s charge. Hortensius promptly married Marcia, who bore him a child. After Hortensius&#x27; death in 50 BC, she inherited &quot;every last sesterce of his estate&quot;. This caused a minor scandal, as after Hortensius&#x27; death she remarried Cato, making both of them rich.

In 50, the year of his death, he successfully defended Appius Claudius Pulcher when accused of treason and corrupt practices by Publius Cornelius Dolabella, afterwards Cicero&#x27;s son-in-law.

==Family==
His daughter Hortensia became a successful orator. In 42, she spoke against the imposition of a special tax on wealthy Roman matrons with such success that part of it was remitted. His son Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, a friend of the poet Catullus, was granted the governorship of Macedonia in 44 by Julius Caesar, before switching allegiance to Brutus and perishing after the debacle of the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. He likely also had a child with Marcia, possibly a daughter or son who became the mother or father of Marcius Hortalus.

==Oratory==
Although none of Hortensius&#x27; speeches is extant, his oratory, according to Cicero, was of the Asiatic style, a florid rhetoric, better to hear than to read. Even though his gestures were highly artificial, and his manner of folding his toga was noted by tragic actors of the day, he was such a &quot;gifted performer that even professional actors would stop rehearsal and come to watch him hold an audience captive with each swish of his toga.&quot; In addition to his style, he had a tenacious memory, and could retain every point in his opponent&#x27;s argument. He also possessed a fine musical voice, which he could skillfully command.

He wrote a treatise on general questions of oratory, erotic poems, and an &quot;Annales&quot;, which gained him considerable reputation as a historian.

==Legacy==
Hortensius&#x27; oratory gave him such vast wealth that he was able to spend his money gratuitously on splendid villas, parks, fish-ponds, costly entertainments, wine, pictures, and other works of art. He was also reputed to be the first to introduce peacocks as a table delicacy at Rome.

Cicero eventually wrote a dialogue, now lost, called &quot;Hortensius&quot; or &quot;On Philosophy&quot;. The work defended the notion that genuine human happiness is to be found by using and embracing philosophy. St. Augustine wrote in his &quot;Confessions&quot; that this work left an impression upon him and moved him to embrace philosophy, and ultimately convert to Christianity.

Another of Cicero&#x27;s works, his history of Latin oratory known as the &quot;Brutus&quot;, is dedicated to the memory of Hortensius. Though he criticises him at various points, Cicero&#x27;s respect for Hortensius is evident throughout, and he frequently mourns his rival&#x27;s death: &#x27;I grieved to have lost in him not, as some may have thought, a rival jealous of my forensic reputation, but rather a friend, and a fellow worker in the same field of glorious endeavour ... each of us was helped by the other with exchange of suggestions, admonitions, and friendly offices&#x27;.

Over the centuries, Hortensius&#x27;s orations were lost, and the last person reported in the literature to have read and commented upon one of Hortensius&#x27;s original works was the first century AD rhetorician Quintilian. Today, not a single speech by Hortensius is extant.

<text>Dog food is specifically formulated food intended for consumption by dogs and other related canines. Dogs are considered to be omnivores with a carnivorous bias. They have the sharp, pointed teeth and shorter gastrointestinal tracts of carnivores, better suited for the consumption of meat than of vegetable substances, yet also have ten genes that are responsible for starch and glucose digestion, as well as the ability to produce amylase, an enzyme that functions to break down carbohydrates into simple sugars – something that obligate carnivores like cats lack. Dogs evolved the ability living alongside humans in agricultural societies, as they managed on scrap leftovers and excrement from humans.

Dogs have managed to adapt over thousands of years to survive on the meat and non-meat scraps and leftovers of human existence and thrive on a variety of foods, with studies suggesting dogs&#x27; ability to digest carbohydrates easily may be a key difference between dogs and wolves.

The dog food recommendation should be based on nutrient suitability instead of dog&#x27;s preferences. Pet owners should consider their dog&#x27;s breed, size, age, and health condition and choose food that is appropriate for their dog&#x27;s nutritional needs.

In the United States alone, the dog food market was expected to reach $23.3 billion by 2022.

==History==
Prior to being domesticated, dogs, being canines, fended for themselves and survived on a carnivorous diet. After adapting them for protection, work, and companionship, people began to care at least in part for their nutritional needs. The historic record of this changing approach dates back at least 2,000 years.

In 37 BCE, Virgil talks about the feeding of dogs in his &quot;Bucolics&quot;:

Around 70 CE, Columella wrote his book &quot;On Agriculture&quot; in which he addresses the feeding of dogs:

In the &quot;Avesta&quot;, written from 224 to 651 CE, Ahura Mazda advises:

By Medieval times, dogs were more seen as pets rather than just companions and workers which affected their quality of the diet to include &quot;Besides being fed bran bread, the dogs would also get some of the meat from the hunt. If a dog was sick, he would get better food, such as goat&#x27;s milk, bean broth, chopped meat, or buttered eggs.&quot;

In France, the word &quot;pâtée&quot; began to appear in the 18th century and referred to a paste originally given to poultry. In 1756, a dictionary indicates it was made of a mixture of bread crumbs and little pieces of meat given to pets.

In 1781, an encyclopedia mentioned an earlier practice of removing the liver, heart, and blood of a downed stag and mixing it with milk, cheese, and bread, and then giving it to dogs.

In 1844, the French writer, Nicolas Boyard, warned against even giving tallow graves (the dregs of the tallow pot) to dogs, though the English favored them (see below), and suggested a meat-flavored soup:

In England, care to give dogs particular food dates at least from the late eighteenth century, when &quot;The Sportsman&#x27;s dictionary&quot; (1785) described the best diet for a dog&#x27;s health in its article &quot;Dog&quot;:

In 1833, &quot;The Complete Farrier&quot; gave similar but far more extensive advice on feeding dogs:

It was not until the mid-1800s that the world saw its first food made specifically for dogs. An American electrician, James Spratt, concocted the first dog treat. Living in London at the time, he witnessed dogs around a shipyard eating scraps of discarded biscuits. Shortly thereafter he introduced his dog food, made up of wheat meals, vegetables and meat. By 1890 production had begun in the United States and became known as &quot;Spratt&#x27;s Patent Limited&quot;.

In later years, dog biscuit was sometimes treated as synonymous with dog food:
Canned horse meat was introduced in the United States under the Ken-L Ration brand after World War I as a means to dispose of excess horses no longer needed for the war. The 1930s saw the introduction of canned cat food and dry meat-meal dog food by the Gaines Food Co. By the time World War II ended, pet food sales had reached $200 million. In the 1950s Spratt&#x27;s became part of General Mills. For companies such as Nabisco, Quaker Oats, and General Foods, pet food represented an opportunity to market by-products as a profitable source of income.

== Impact and sustainability ==
== Commercial varieties ==
Most commercially produced dog food is made with animal feed grade ingredients and comes dry in bags (also known in the US as &quot;kibble&quot;) or wet in cans. Dry food contains 6–10% moisture by volume, as compared to 60–90% in canned food. Semi-moist products typically run 25–35%. Isotopic analysis of dog food in the Brazilian market have found that they are basically made of maize and poultry by-products.

=== Dry ===
Dry dog food usually consists of bagged pellets that contain 3-11% water. It makes up the vast majority of pet foods.

====Manufacturing process====

Dry food processing is popular in the pet food industry, as it is an efficient way to supply continuous production of feed in many varieties. It is energy efficient, allows for large amounts of feed to be used, and is cost effective.

To make dog kibble, a process known as extrusion is done. A simple extruder consists of a barrel, helical screws, and a die (tool to cut and shape food). Feed ingredients are solid at room temperature; therefore, the extrusion process of these ingredients requires a temperature above 150 degrees Celsius, achieved by the use of steam, hot water, or other heat sources in order to soften or melt the mixture and allow for fluidity through the barrel. During the extrusion process, the high amounts of pressure applied to the mixture forces it to enter through the die before exiting the extruder completely, where it is cut to its desired size by a rotating fly knife.

Unfortunately, the extrusion process actually denatures some of nutritional elements of the food. Taurine deficiency has been found in dogs and cats fed extruded commercial diets. Not usually considered an essential nutrient for dogs, taurine is plentiful in most whole meats, whether raw or cooked, but is reduced in extruded diets. Taurine deficiency could also be due to the use of rendered, highly processed meat sources that are low in taurine. Regardless of the cause, taurine is now artificially supplemented back into the diet after processing in the production of most commercial pet food.

=== Wet ===
Wet or canned dog food usually is packaged in a solid or soft-sided container. Wet food contains roughly 60-78% water, which is significantly higher in moisture than dry or semi-moist food. Canned food is commercially sterile (cooked during canning); other wet foods may not be sterile. Sterilizing is done through the process of retorting, which involves steam sterilization at 121 degrees Celsius. A given wet food will often be higher in protein or fat compared to a similar dry food on a dry matter basis (a measure which ignores moisture); given the canned food&#x27;s high moisture content. A larger amount of canned food must be fed in order to meet the dog&#x27;s required needs. Grain gluten and other protein gels may be used in wet dog food to create artificial meaty chunks, which look like real meat. This food is usually used for old dogs or puppies.
==== Manufacturing process ====
After ingredients are combined, they are placed in a tank at the end of a canning machine. From there, the mixture is forced through an opening and onto a metal sheet, forming a thickness of 8 to 12mm. Next, the mixture is heated to thoroughly cook the ingredients. Heating can be done through the means of ovens, microwaves or steam heating. The sheet containing a layer of feed is passed through the heat source that displays heat to the top and bottom of the tray, allowing the internal temperature to reach 77 degrees Celsius at a minimum. Once cooked, this mixture can be directly placed into cans to form a loaf or it can be cut into &quot;meaty&quot; pieces for chunks and gravy formulas.

=== Semi-moist ===
Semi-moist dog food is packaged in vacuum-sealed pouches or packets. It contains about 20-45% water by weight, making it more expensive per energy calorie than dry food.

Most semi-moist food does not require refrigeration. They are lightly cooked and then quickly sealed in a vacuum package. This type of dog food is extremely vulnerable to spoiling if not kept at a cool temperature and has a shelf life of 2–4 months, unopened.

=== Dehydrated and freeze-dried ===

Dehydrated or freeze-dried meals come in raw and cooked forms. Products are usually air-dried or frozen, then dehydrated (freeze-dried) to reduce moisture to the level where bacterial growths are inhibited. The appearance is very similar to dry dog pellets. The typical feeding methods include adding warm water before serving. There is some concern of nutrients, such as vitamins, being lost during the dehydration process.

Specialty small batches sold through specialty or online stores generally consist of some form of cooked meat, ground bone, pureed vegetables, taurine supplements, and other multivitamin supplements. Some pet owners use human vitamin supplements, and others use vitamin supplements specifically engineered for dogs.

=== Contents ===

Many commercial dog foods are made from materials considered by some authorities and dog owners to be unusable or undesirable. These may include:
* Meat and bone meal
* Offal (wild canines eat offal as a vital part of their diets)
* Animal digest
* Sucrose and/or fructose
* Animal by-products

Less expensive dog foods generally include less meat and more animal by-products and grain fillers. Proponents of a natural diet criticize the use of such ingredients, and point out that regulations allow for packaging that might lead a consumer to believe that they are buying natural food, when, in reality, the food might be composed mostly of ingredients such as those listed above. More expensive dog foods may be made of ingredients suitable for organic products or free range meats. Lamb meal is a popular ingredient.

According to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), animal by-products in pet food may include parts obtained from any animals that have died from sickness or disease, provided they are rendered in accordance to law. Cow brains and spinal cords not allowed for human consumption under federal regulation 21CFR589.2000 due to the possibility of transmission of BSE are allowed to be included in pet food intended for non-ruminant animals. In 2003, the AVMA speculated changes might be made to animal feed regulations to ban materials from &quot;4-D&quot; animals – those who enter the food chain as dead, dying, diseased or disabled.

=== Quality, digestibility and energy density ===
There are a few key components to consider when evaluating dietary needs. These factors include the quality and digestibility of the protein provided in the diet, as well as the composition of the amino acids included, and finally the energy density provided in the diet. Diets containing proteins that are high in quality, composition, and digestibility require less of that protein to be present. The same can be said in regards to the energy density. In contrast, high-protein diets will provide excess protein content after meeting maintenance demands; this can therefore lead to the protein being utilized in fat and energy storage. This ultimately increases the risk for developing obesity and other health related issues. Higher protein in the diet helps reduce lean body mass loss, but will not lead to an increase in size of muscle unless paired with resistance exercises or anabolic steroids under maintenance conditions.

===Labeling===

In the United States, dog foods labelled as &quot;complete and balanced&quot; must meet standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. The Dog Food Nutrient Profiles were last updated in 2016 by the AAFCO&#x27;s Canine Nutrition Expert Subcommittee.

Critics argue that due to the limitations of the trial and the gaps in knowledge within animal nutrition science, the term &quot;complete and balanced&quot; is inaccurate and even deceptive. An AAFCO panel expert has stated that &quot;although the AAFCO profiles are better than nothing, they provide false securities.&quot;

Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as &quot;premium&quot;, &quot;ultra premium&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, and &quot;holistic&quot;. Such terms currently have no legal definitions and are not regulated. There are also varieties of dog food labeled as &quot;human-grade food.&quot; Although no official definition of this term exists, the assumption is that other brands use foods that would not pass US Food and Drug Administration inspection according to the Pure Food and Drug Act or the Meat Inspection Act.

The ingredients on the label must be listed in descending order by weight before cooking. This means before all of the moisture is removed from the meat, fruits, vegetables and other ingredients used.

== Types of diets ==

===Raw===

Raw feeding is the practice of feeding domestic dogs, cats and other animals a diet consisting primarily of uncooked meat, edible bones, and organs. The ingredients used to formulate raw diets can vary. Some pet owners choose to make homemade raw diets to feed their animals but commercial raw food diets are also available.

Frozen, or fresh-prepared, meals come in raw or cooked form, some of which is made with ingredients that are inspected, approved, and certified by the USDA for human consumption, but formulated for pets. Part of this growing trend is the commercialization of home-made dog food for pet owners who want the same quality, but do not have the time or expertise to make it themselves. The advantage is forgoing the processing stage that traditional dog food undergoes. This causes less destruction of its nutritional integrity.

The practice of feeding raw diets has raised some concerns due to the risk of foodborne illnesses, zoonosis and nutritional imbalances. People who feed their dogs raw food do so for a multitude of reasons, including but not limited to: culture, beliefs surrounding health, nutrition and what is perceived to be more natural for their pets. Feeding raw food can be perceived as allowing the pet to stay in touch with their wild, carnivorous ancestry. The raw food movement has occurred in parallel to the change in human food trends for more natural and organic products.

=== Senior ===

Aging dogs require specialized catering. Commercially available senior dog diets address their physiological changes through various ingredients and nutrients.

When looking for a senior dog food, one of the first things that should be taken into consideration is the energy content of the diet. The maintenance energy requirements decrease as a dog ages due to the loss in lean body mass that occurs. Therefore, senior dogs will require a diet with a lowered energy content compared to non senior diets. Although senior dogs require lower energy content diets, they will also require diets that are higher in protein and protein digestibility. This is due to the fact that dogs have a reduced ability to synthesize proteins as they age.

Joint and bone health is an important factor to be considered when purchasing a senior dog food. The addition of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate has been shown to improve cartilage formation, the composition of synovial fluid, as well as improve signs of osteoarthritis. The calcium to phosphorus ratio of senior dog foods is also important. Calcium and phosphorus are considered essential nutrients, according to AAFCO.

Gastrointestinal health is another important factor to consider in the aging dog. Sources of fiber such as beet pulp and flaxseed should be included within senior dog foods to help improve stool quality and prevent constipation. A current technology that is being used to improve gastrointestinal health of aging dogs is the addition of fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides are used in combination to improve the beneficial gut bacteria while eliminating the harmful gut bacteria.

The aging dog goes through changes in brain and cognitive health. There are two highly important ingredients that can be included in senior dog foods to help prevent cognitive decline and improve brain health. These ingredients are vitamin E and L-carnitine. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, which can prevent oxidative damage that occurs during aging. L-carnitine is used to improve mitochondrial function, which can also help to prevent and lower rates of oxidative damage.

Skin and coat health is important in all dogs, but especially becomes important as dogs age. An important nutrient to look for in senior dog foods to support coat health is linoleic acid, which can be found in corn and soybean oil. Another important nutrient is vitamin A, which helps with keratinization of hair. Good sources of vitamin A for skin and coat health include egg yolk and liver.

Immune system health has been shown to decline in aging dogs. The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids plays an important role in providing optimal health. Vitamin E can be used as an antioxidant in senior dog foods. Pre- and probiotics can also be added to senior dog foods to help improve the beneficial bacteria in the gut, providing support for the immune system.

=== Low-protein ===
According to The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) nutrient guideline for cats and dogs, the minimum protein requirement for dogs during adult maintenance is 18% on a dry matter (DM) basis. Other parts of the world would have a guideline similar to AAFCO. The European Pet Food Federation (FEDIAF) also stated a minimum of 18%. AAFCO only provided a minimum, but majority of the diets found on the market contain a protein level exceeding the minimum. Some diets have a protein level lower than others (such as 18-20%). These low-protein diets would not be seen with growth and reproductive life stages because of their higher demand for protein, as such, these diets are for dogs meeting maintenance levels. They can be purchased, such as vegetarian, vegan, weight control, and senior diets. Furthermore, this protein requirement varies from species to species.

==== Disadvantages ====
There is an increasing risk of the practice of coprophagy when providing low-protein diets to dogs; a negative correlation exists between the amount of protein fed and the occurrence of coprophagy. Maintenance needs should still be met by low-protein diets, and the muscle turnover (i.e. synthesis and breakdown) will also remain at an optimal rate, as long as the amino acid intake remains balanced and there are no limiting amino acids. There is a greater opportunity for amino acids to balance in diets containing more protein.

==== Advantages ====
The dog&#x27;s simple gastrointestinal tract contains a vast array of microbial populations; some members of this very diversified community include Fusobacteriota, Pseudomonadota, and Actinomycetota. The gut microbiota of the dog will be comparable to that of the owners due to similar environmental impacts. Not only are the microbes influenced by the dog&#x27;s environment, but they are also affected by the macronutrient content of the dog&#x27;s diet. The populations present and health status of the microbiota found within the gut can alter the physiological and metabolic functions of the dog, which then subsequently affects susceptibility to disease development.

Fermentation and digestion in the hindgut of a dog can potentially be improved depending on the source and the concentration of protein provide in a diet. Greater digestibility due to higher quality ingredients, in addition to lower protein concentrations within a diet, will help promote beneficial outcomes in assisting the health of a dog&#x27;s gastrointestinal tract. Higher protein entering the gut will lead to more putrefaction that give rise to various toxins including carcinogens and increase the chances of many bowel diseases, such as colorectal cancer.

The age of dogs and cats is inversely proportional to protein consumption. As they age, the protein requirement decreases due to lower level of pepsin in their stomachs. There has also been discussion about higher protein content in diets being inversely related with lifespan (i.e. negative relationship), where lower protein content diets were related to longer lifespans.

===Hypoallergenic===
Dogs are prone to have adverse allergic reactions to food similar to human beings. The most common symptoms of food allergies in dogs include rashes, swelling, itchy or tender skin, and gastrointestinal upsets such as uncontrollable bowel movements and soft stools. Certain ingredients in dog food can elicit these allergic reactions. Specifically, the reactions are understood to be initiated by the protein ingredients in dog food, with sources such as beef, chicken, soy, and turkey being common causes of these allergic reactions. A number of &quot;novel protein&quot; dog foods are available that claim to alleviate such allergies in dogs.

Hypoallergenic diets for dogs with food allergies consist of either limited ingredients, novel proteins, or hydrolyzed proteins. Limited ingredients make it possible to identify the suspected allergens causing these allergic reactions, as well as making it easy to avoid multiple ingredients if a canine is allergic to more than one. In novel protein recipes, manufacturers use ingredients which are less likely to cause allergic reactions in dogs such as lamb, fish, and rice. Hydrolyzed proteins do not come from a novel source; they could originate from chicken or soy for example. Hydrolyzed proteins become novel when they are broken apart into unrecognizable versions of themselves, making them novel to allergic gastrointestinal tracts.

===Grain-free and low-carbohydrate===
Some dog food products differentiate themselves as grain- or carbohydrate-free to offer the consumer an alternative, claiming carbohydrates in pet foods to be fillers with little or no nutritional value. A study published in &quot;Nature&quot; suggests that domestic dogs&#x27; ability to easily metabolize carbohydrates may be a key difference between wolves and dogs.

Some consumers and manufacturers say dogs perform better on grain-free diets, while some veterinarians doubt this for a lack of scientific evidence. In 2019, a study comparing dry dog food that was manufactured in the United States found that 75% of food containing feed grade grains also contained measurable levels of various mycotoxins (discussed below), while none of the grain-free dry diets tested had any detectable levels of mycotoxins. Feed grade (lower quality grade) grains that are allowed to spoil and become moldy are the suspected source of the mycotoxins. This is the first published study to show a potential health benefit to feeding grain-free commercial dry pet foods.

In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration identified 16 dog food brands linked to canine heart disease. The FDA has investigated more than 500 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs eating food marketed as grain-free. The 16 brands are: Acana, Zignature, Taste of the Wild, 4Health, Earthborn Holistic, Blue Buffalo, Nature&#x27;s Domain, Fromm, Merrick, California Natural, Natural Balance, Orijen, Nature&#x27;s Variety, NutriSource, Nutro, and Rachael Ray Nutrish. These brands are labeled as &quot;grain-free&quot; and list peas, lentils, or potatoes as the main ingredient. The top three brands associated with reports of cardiomyopathy are Acana with 67 reports, Zignature with 64, and Taste of the Wild with 53 reports.

In 2022, the FDA released a follow-up report which superseded the 2019 research. The follow-up report stated the following:
=== Vegetarian and vegan ===

Like the human practice of veganism, vegan dog foods are those formulated with the exclusion of ingredients that contain or were processed with any part of an animal, or any animal byproduct. A 2023 systematic review found no evidence of serious impacts on animal health from vegetarian cat and dog diets; however, the authors noted that the studies suffered from issues such as selection bias, low sample size, and short feeding periods and recommended further research.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3390/vetsci10010052&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The omnivorous domestic canine has evolved to metabolize carbohydrates and thrive on a diet lower in protein, and a vegan diet may be adequate if properly formulated and balanced.

Popularity of this diet has grown with a corresponding increase in people practicing vegetarianism and veganism as well as with growing concerns about environmental issues such as climate change or awareness of the large environmental impacts of animal agriculture. Vegetarian dog foods are produced to either assuage a pet owner&#x27;s ethical concerns or for animals with extreme allergies.

Due to the exclusion of animal products and by-products, which are primary ingredients of conventional dog food, many nutrients that would otherwise be provided by animal products need to be provided by replacement, plant-based ingredients. While both animal and plant products offer a wide range of macro and micronutrients, strategic formulation of plant ingredients should be considered to meet nutritional requirements, as different nutrients are more abundant in different plant sources. Despite the large differences in ingredient sourcing, studies have demonstrated that a plant-based diet can be just as edible and palatable as animal-based diets for dogs. There are now various commercial vegetarian and vegan diets available on the market.

;Special considerations
Some nutrients that require special consideration include protein, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, taurine, L-carnitine, and omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA. Although their sources are more limited without animal products, it is possible to formulate a diet adequate in these nutrients through plant and synthetic sources. A review recommends a cautious approach to vegan dog food given &quot;the lack of large population-based studies&quot; as of 2023 and that commercial foods are used if guardians wish to implement a vegan diet.

Potential risks in feeding a plant-based diet include alkaline urine and nutrient inadequacy, especially in homemade diets. Adherence to recommendations by reliable sources is strongly advised.

== Nutrients and supplements ==

The requirements and functions of nutrients in dogs are largely similar to those in cats, with many requirements relaxed:
* The requirement of arginine in the urea cycle is reduced, as dogs have a functional pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase.
* Dogs have a functional delta 6 desaturase, hence no specific need for arachidonic acid.
* Dogs have a functional sulfinoalanine decarboxylase, hence no need for taurine.
* Unlike cats, dogs and humans can use Vitamin D2 nearly as efficiently as they use Vitamin D3.

=== Chart ===


The European Union does not use a unified nutrient requirement. A manufacturer committee called FEDIAF (European Pet Food Industry Federation) makes recommendations for cats and dogs that members follow. Both AAFCO and FEDIAF publish in two formats: one in the amount-per-kilogram form above, another in an energy-ratio format.

==Dangers==

A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulfate, alliin or allyl propyl disulfide poisoning), grapes and raisins (cause kidney failure in dogs), milk (some dogs are lactose intolerant and suffer diarrhea; goats&#x27; milk can be beneficial to dogs), mushrooms, fatty foods, rhubarb, xylitol, macadamia nuts, as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.
A full list of poison/toxic substances can be found on the ASPCA&#x27;s website.

===Recalls===
The 2007 pet food recalls involved the massive recall of many brands of cat and dog foods beginning in March 2007. The recalls came in response to reports of renal failure in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company, beginning in February 2007. After more than three weeks of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on March 16, 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals.

Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods, with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The contaminant was identified as melamine, which had been added as an adulterant to simulate a higher protein content.

In the United States, there has been extensive media coverage of the recall. There have been calls for government regulation of pet foods, which had previously been self-regulated by pet food manufacturers. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods losing roughly $30 million alone from the recall.

===Contaminants===
==== Mycotoxins ====

In April 2014, aflatoxin B1, a known carcinogenic toxin, melamine, and cyanuric acid were all found in various brands of USA pet food imported into Hong Kong. Since 1993, the FDA has confirmed concerns of toxins in feed grade (animal grade) ingredients, yet to date no comprehensive federal regulation exists on mycotoxin testing in feed grade (animal grade) ingredients used to make pet food.

In 1997, the &quot;Journal of Food Additives and Contaminants&quot; established that low levels of various mycotoxins could cause health concerns in pets, and was found in feed grade ingredients.

A study published in the &quot;Journal of Food Protection&quot; in 2001 cited concerns regarding fungi (the source of mycotoxins) in commercial pet foods and warned about the &quot;risk for animal health&quot;.

In 2006, a study published in the &quot;Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry&quot; confirmed mycotoxins in pet foods around the world and concluded that contamination of mycotoxins in pet foods can lead to chronic effects on the health of pets.

In 2007, the &quot;International Journal of Food Microbiology&quot; published a study that claimed &quot;mycotoxin contamination in pet food poses a serious health threat to pets&quot;, and listed them: aflatoxins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes, zearalenone, fumonisins and fusaric acid.

A 2008 study published in the &quot;Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition&quot; found high levels of mycotoxins in the raw ingredients used for pet food in Brazil.

A 2010 study in the &quot;Journal of Mycotoxin Research&quot; tested 26 commercial dog foods and found mycotoxins at concerning sub-lethal levels. It was determined that long-term exposure to low levels of confirmed mycotoxins could pose chronic health risks.

For all the above reasons, a trend away from feed ingredients and toward USDA-certified ingredients fit for human consumption has developed.

In 1999, another fungal toxin triggered the recall of dry dog food made by Doane Pet Care at one of its plants, including Ol&#x27; Roy, Wal-Mart&#x27;s brand, as well as 53 other brands. This time the toxin killed 25 dogs.

A 2005 consumer alert was released for contaminated Diamond Pet Foods for dogs and cats. Over 100 canine deaths and at least one feline fatality have been linked to Diamond Pet Foods contaminated by potentially deadly aflatoxin, according to Cornell University veterinarians.

==== &quot;Salmonella&quot; and copper ====

The FDA released a video focusing on another major threat in commercial pet food: &quot;Salmonella&quot; bacterial contamination. They also cite other major toxins of concern. The video references the case of a specific commercial pet food plant that was also the subject of a March 2014 study published in the &quot;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association&quot;. It details how at least 53 known human illnesses were linked to commercial pet foods made at that plant in 2012. A class action lawsuit linked to this outbreak was settled in 2014.

The video also cites the dangers of over supplementation of nutrients in pet food. A study published in the &quot;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association&quot; in February 2013 suggested a correlation between liver disease and the amount of copper supplementation in AAFCO diets.

==In popular culture==
Eating your own dog food or dogfooding is the practice of using your own products or services.

<doc id="236578" wikidata="Q1143852" url="?curid=236578" title="Lek (river)">
<text>The Lek () is a river in the western Netherlands of some in length. It is the continuation of the Nederrijn after the Kromme Rijn branches off at the town of Wijk bij Duurstede. The main westbound waterway is hereafter called the Lek River. The Nederrijn is, itself, a distributary branch of the river Rhine.

Portions of the river form the boundary between the provinces of Utrecht and Gelderland, and between Utrecht and South Holland.

In Roman times, the Nederrijn flowed into the Kromme Rijn and these streams were the main outflow of the river Rhine. When the Kromme Rijn began to silt up in the Middle Ages, the Lek became the primary branch. A short distance past Wijk bij Duurstede, the river intersects with the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal, which continues south towards the Waal. A branch of this canal, the &quot;Lekkanaal&quot; (Lek Canal) is connected to the river at the city of Nieuwegein.

Other major towns on its banks are Culemborg, Vianen, Schoonhoven, Nieuw-Lekkerland, Lekkerkerk, Bergambacht, and Krimpen aan de Lek. The bed of the river lies slightly higher than the surrounding lands and dikes are therefore essential to contain the Lek. At the village of Kinderdijk the Lek meets the Noord River and the combined stream is thereafter known as the Nieuwe Maas as it flows down towards the North Sea.
