<text>In electronics, negative resistance (NR) is a property of some electrical circuits and devices in which an increase in voltage across the device&#x27;s terminals results in a decrease in electric current through it.

This is in contrast to an ordinary resistor in which an increase of applied voltage causes a proportional increase in current due to Ohm&#x27;s law, resulting in a positive resistance. Under certain conditions it can increase the power of an electrical signal, amplifying it.

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few nonlinear electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: &#x27;static&#x27; or &#x27;absolute resistance&#x27;, the ratio of voltage to current formula_1, and &quot;differential resistance&quot;, the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current formula_2. The term negative resistance means negative differential resistance (NDR), formula_3. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can amplify, converting DC power applied to its terminals to AC output power to amplify an AC signal applied to the same terminals. They are used in electronic oscillators and amplifiers, particularly at microwave frequencies. Most microwave energy is produced with negative differential resistance devices. They can also have hysteresis and be bistable, and so are used in switching and memory circuits. Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, and gas discharge tubes such as neon lamps, and fluorescent lights. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as transistors and op amps with positive feedback can have negative differential resistance. These are used in oscillators and active filters.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive &quot;ohmic&quot; resistances usually encountered in electric circuits. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can only have negative resistance over a limited portion of their voltage or current range. 

==Definitions==
The resistance between two terminals of an electrical device or circuit is determined by its current–voltage (&quot;I–V&quot;) curve (characteristic curve), giving the current formula_4 through it for any given voltage formula_5 across it. Most materials, including the ordinary (positive) resistances encountered in electrical circuits, obey Ohm&#x27;s law; the current through them is proportional to the voltage over a wide range. So the &quot;I–V&quot; curve of an ohmic resistance is a straight line through the origin with positive slope. The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in &quot;I–V&quot; graphs where the voltage formula_5 is the independent variable) and is constant.

Negative resistance occurs in a few nonlinear (nonohmic) devices. In a nonlinear component the &quot;I–V&quot; curve is not a straight line, so it does not obey Ohm&#x27;s law. Resistance can still be defined, but the resistance is not constant; it varies with the voltage or current through the device. The resistance of such a nonlinear device can be defined in two ways, which are equal for ohmic resistances:

*Static resistance (also called &quot;chordal resistance&quot;, &quot;absolute resistance&quot; or just &quot;resistance&quot;) – This is the common definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current: formula_7 It is the inverse slope of the line (chord) from the origin through the point on the &quot;I–V&quot; curve. In a power source, like a battery or electric generator, positive current flows &quot;out&quot; of the positive voltage terminal, opposite to the direction of current in a resistor, so from the passive sign convention formula_4 and formula_5 have opposite signs, representing points lying in the 2nd or 4th quadrant of the &quot;I–V&quot; plane &quot;(diagram right)&quot;. Thus power sources formally have &quot;negative static resistance&quot; (formula_10 However this term is never used in practice, because the term &quot;resistance&quot; is only applied to passive components. Static resistance determines the power dissipation in a component. Passive devices, which consume electric power, have positive static resistance; while active devices, which produce electric power, do not.

*Differential resistance (also called &quot;dynamic&quot;, or &quot;incremental&quot; resistance) – This is the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current; the ratio of a small change in voltage to the corresponding change in current, the inverse slope of the &quot;I–V&quot; curve at a point: formula_11 Differential resistance is only relevant to time-varying currents. Points on the curve where the slope is negative (declining to the right), meaning an increase in voltage causes a decrease in current, have negative differential resistance . Devices of this type can amplify signals, and are what is usually meant by the term &quot;negative resistance&quot;.

Negative resistance, like positive resistance, is measured in ohms.

Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance. It is measured in siemens (formerly &quot;mho&quot;) which is the conductance of a resistor with a resistance of one ohm. Each type of resistance defined above has a corresponding conductance
*Static conductance formula_12
*Differential conductance formula_13
It can be seen that the conductance has the same sign as its corresponding resistance: a negative resistance will have a negative conductance while a positive resistance will have a positive conductance.

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
==Types and terminology==
In an electronic device, the differential resistance formula_14, the static resistance formula_15, or both, can be negative, so there are three categories of devices &quot;(fig. 2–4 above, and table)&quot; which could be called &quot;negative resistances&quot;.

The term &quot;negative resistance&quot; almost always means negative &quot;differential&quot; resistance Negative differential resistance devices have unique capabilities: they can act as &quot;one-port amplifiers&quot;, increasing the power of a time-varying signal applied to their port (terminals), or excite oscillations in a tuned circuit to make an oscillator. They can also have hysteresis. It is not possible for a device to have negative differential resistance without a power source, and these devices can be divided into two categories depending on whether they get their power from an internal source or from their port:

*Passive negative differential resistance devices (fig. 2 above): These are the most well-known type of &quot;negative resistances&quot;; passive two-terminal components whose intrinsic &quot;I–V&quot; curve has a downward &quot;kink&quot;, causing the current to decrease with increasing voltage over a limited range. The &quot;I–V&quot; curve, including the negative resistance region, lies in the 1st and 3rd quadrant of the plane so the device has positive static resistance. Examples are gas-discharge tubes, tunnel diodes, and Gunn diodes. These devices have no internal power source and in general work by converting external DC power from their port to time varying (AC) power, so they require a DC bias current applied to the port in addition to the signal. To add to the confusion, some authors call these &quot;active&quot; devices, since they can amplify. This category also includes a few three-terminal devices, such as the unijunction transistor. They are covered in the Negative differential resistance section below.
*Active negative differential resistance devices (fig. 4): Circuits can be designed in which a positive voltage applied to the terminals will cause a proportional &quot;negative&quot; current; a current &quot;out&quot; of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor, over a limited range, Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the &quot;I–V&quot; curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power. Amplifying devices like transistors and op-amps with positive feedback can have this type of negative resistance, and are used in feedback oscillators and active filters. Since these circuits produce net power from their port, they must have an internal DC power source, or else a separate connection to an external power supply. In circuit theory this is called an &quot;active resistor&quot;. Although this type is sometimes referred to as &quot;linear&quot;, &quot;absolute&quot;, &quot;ideal&quot;, or &quot;pure&quot; negative resistance to distinguish it from &quot;passive&quot; negative differential resistances, in electronics it is more often simply called positive feedback or &quot;regeneration&quot;. These are covered in the Active resistors section below.


Occasionally ordinary power sources are referred to as &quot;negative resistances&quot; (fig. 3 above). Although the &quot;static&quot; or &quot;absolute&quot; resistance formula_15 of active devices (power sources) can be considered negative (see Negative static resistance section below) most ordinary power sources (AC or DC), such as batteries, generators, and (non positive feedback) amplifiers, have positive &quot;differential&quot; resistance (their source resistance). Therefore, these devices cannot function as one-port amplifiers or have the other capabilities of negative differential resistances.

==List of negative resistance devices==
Electronic components with negative differential resistance include these devices:
*tunnel diode, resonant tunneling diode and other semiconductor diodes using the tunneling mechanism
*Gunn diode and other diodes using the transferred electron mechanism
*IMPATT diode, TRAPATT diode and other diodes using the impact ionization mechanism
*Some NPN transistors with E-C reverse biased, known as negistor
*unijunction transistor (UJT)
*thyristors
*triode and tetrode vacuum tubes operating in the dynatron mode
*Some magnetron tubes and other microwave vacuum tubes
*maser
*parametric amplifier

Electric discharges through gases also exhibit negative differential resistance, including these devices

*electric arc
*thyratron tubes
*neon lamp
*fluorescent lamp
*other gas discharge tubes

In addition, active circuits with negative differential resistance can also be built with amplifying devices like transistors and op amps, using feedback. A number of new experimental negative differential resistance materials and devices have been discovered in recent years. The physical processes which cause negative resistance are diverse, and each type of device has its own negative resistance characteristics, specified by its current–voltage curve.

== Negative static or &quot;absolute&quot; resistance ==
A point of some confusion is whether ordinary resistance (&quot;static&quot; or &quot;absolute&quot; resistance, formula_17) can be negative. In electronics, the term &quot;resistance&quot; is customarily applied only to passive materials and components – such as wires, resistors and diodes. These cannot have formula_18 as shown by Joule&#x27;s law A passive device consumes electric power, so from the passive sign convention formula_19. Therefore, from Joule&#x27;s law In other words, no material can conduct electric current better than a &quot;perfect&quot; conductor with zero resistance. For a passive device to have formula_20 would violate either conservation of energy or the second law of thermodynamics, &quot;(diagram)&quot;. Therefore, some authors state that static resistance can never be negative.

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current v/i at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative. For electric power (potential energy) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, conventional current (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal. So the direction of the instantaneous current is &quot;out&quot; of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the passive sign convention so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
formula_21
This can also be proved from Joule&#x27;s law
formula_22
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit if and only if formula_18. Whether or not this quantity is referred to as &quot;resistance&quot; when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative, but this is not to be regarded as &quot;resistance&quot; in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to conservation of energy it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit &quot;(right)&quot;.

Work must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so conservation of energy requires that negative static resistances have a source of power. The power may come from an internal source which converts some other form of energy to electric power as in a battery or generator, or from a separate connection to an external power supply circuit as in an amplifying device like a transistor, vacuum tube, or op amp.

===Eventual passivity===
A circuit cannot have negative static resistance (be active) over an infinite voltage or current range, because it would have to be able to produce infinite power. Any active circuit or device with a finite power source is &quot;eventually passive&quot;. This property means if a large enough external voltage or current of either polarity is applied to it, its static resistance becomes positive and it consumes power
formula_24
where formula_25 is the maximum power the device can produce.

Therefore, the ends of the &quot;I–V&quot; curve will eventually turn and enter the 1st and 3rd quadrants. Thus the range of the curve having negative static resistance is limited, confined to a region around the origin. For example, applying a voltage to a generator or battery &quot;(graph, above)&quot; greater than its open-circuit voltage will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage &quot;V&quot;s will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

== Negative differential resistance ==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the &quot;I–V&quot; curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:
formula_26
The &quot;I–V&quot; curve is nonmonotonic (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

Passive negative differential resistances have positive &quot;static&quot; resistance; they consume net power. Therefore, the &quot;I–V&quot; curve is confined to the 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph, and passes through the origin. This requirement means (excluding some asymptotic cases) that the region(s) of negative resistance must be limited, and surrounded by regions of positive resistance, and cannot include the origin.

===Types===
Negative differential resistances can be classified into two types:
*Voltage controlled negative resistance (VCNR, &quot;short-circuit stable&quot;, or &quot;N&quot; type): In this type the current is a single valued, continuous function of the voltage, but the voltage is a multivalued function of the current. In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter &quot;N&quot;. As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (&quot;i&quot;1), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (&quot;i&quot;2), then increases again. Devices with this type of negative resistance include the tunnel diode, resonant tunneling diode, lambda diode, Gunn diode, and dynatron oscillators.
*Current controlled negative resistance (CCNR, &quot;open-circuit stable&quot;, or &quot;S&quot; type): In this type, the dual of the VCNR, the voltage is a single valued function of the current, but the current is a multivalued function of the voltage. In the most common type, with one negative resistance region, the graph is a curve shaped like the letter &quot;S&quot;. Devices with this type of negative resistance include the IMPATT diode, UJT, SCRs and other thyristors, electric arc, and gas discharge tubes .

Most devices have a single negative resistance region. However devices with multiple separate negative resistance regions can also be fabricated. These can have more than two stable states, and are of interest for use in digital circuits to implement multivalued logic.

An intrinsic parameter used to compare different devices is the &quot;peak-to-valley current ratio&quot; (PVR), the ratio of the current at the top of the negative resistance region to the current at the bottom &quot;(see graphs, above)&quot;:
formula_27
The larger this is, the larger the potential AC output for a given DC bias current, and therefore the greater the efficiency

===Amplification===
A negative differential resistance device can amplify an AC signal applied to it if the signal is biased with a DC voltage or current to lie within the negative resistance region of its &quot;I–V&quot; curve.

The tunnel diode circuit &quot;(see diagram)&quot; is an example. The tunnel diode &quot;TD&quot; has voltage controlled negative differential resistance. The battery formula_28 adds a constant voltage (bias) across the diode so it operates in its negative resistance range, and provides power to amplify the signal. Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is formula_29. For stability formula_30 must be less than formula_31. Using the formula for a voltage divider, the AC output voltage is
formula_32 so the voltage gain is formula_33
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance formula_34 is less than the resistance of the diode alone formula_31 so the AC output voltage formula_36 is greater than the input formula_37. The voltage gain formula_38 is greater than one, and increases without limit as formula_30 approaches formula_31.

===Explanation of power gain===
The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the superposition principle the voltage and current at the device&#x27;s terminals can be divided into a DC bias component and an AC component .
formula_41
formula_42
Since a positive change in voltage formula_43 causes a &quot;negative&quot; change in current formula_44, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° out of phase. This means in the AC equivalent circuit &quot;(right)&quot;, the instantaneous AC current Δ&quot;i&quot; flows through the device in the direction of &quot;increasing&quot; AC potential Δ&quot;v&quot;, as it would in a generator. Therefore, the AC power dissipation is &quot;negative&quot;; AC power is produced by the device and flows into the external circuit.
formula_45
With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an amplifier, or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an oscillator. Unlike in a two port amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals (port) as the input signal enters.

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current, the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power
formula_46
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input. The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

The device may also have reactance and therefore the phase difference between current and voltage may differ from 180° and may vary with frequency. As long as the real component of the impedance is negative (phase angle between 90° and 270°), the device will have negative resistance and can amplify.

The maximum AC output power is limited by size of the negative resistance region (formula_47 in graphs above)
formula_48

===Reflection coefficient===
The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from transmission line theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the &quot;incident wave&quot; formula_49, which travels toward the device, and the &quot;reflected wave&quot; formula_50, which travels away from the device. A negative differential resistance in a circuit can amplify if the magnitude of its reflection coefficient formula_51, the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave, is greater than one.
formula_52 where formula_53
The &quot;reflected&quot; (output) signal has larger amplitude than the incident; the device has &quot;reflection gain&quot;. The reflection coefficient is determined by the AC impedance of the negative resistance device, formula_54, and the impedance of the circuit attached to it, formula_55. If formula_56 and formula_57 then formula_58 and the device will amplify. On the Smith chart, a graphical aide widely used in the design of high frequency circuits, negative differential resistance corresponds to points outside the unit circle formula_59, the boundary of the conventional chart, so special &quot;expanded&quot; charts must be used.

===Stability conditions===
Because it is nonlinear, a circuit with negative differential resistance can have multiple equilibrium points (possible DC operating points), which lie on the &quot;I–V&quot; curve. An equilibrium point will be stable, so the circuit converges to it within some neighborhood of the point, if its poles are in the left half of the s plane (LHP), while a point is unstable, causing the circuit to oscillate or &quot;latch up&quot; (converge to another point), if its poles are on the &quot;jω&quot; axis or right half plane (RHP), respectively. In contrast, a linear circuit has a single equilibrium point that may be stable or unstable. The equilibrium points are determined by the DC bias circuit, and their stability is determined by the AC impedance formula_60 of the external circuit.
However, because of the different shapes of the curves, the condition for stability is different for VCNR and CCNR types of negative resistance:
*In a CCNR (S-type) negative resistance, the resistance function formula_61 is single-valued. Therefore, stability is determined by the poles of the circuit&#x27;s impedance equation:formula_62.
:For nonreactive circuits a sufficient condition for stability is that the total resistance is positive formula_63 so the CCNR is stable for

:Since CCNRs are stable with no load at all, they are called &quot;open circuit stable&quot;.
*In a VCNR (N-type) negative resistance, the conductance function formula_64 is single-valued. Therefore, stability is determined by the poles of the admittance equation formula_65. For this reason the VCNR is sometimes referred to as a negative conductance.As above, for nonreactive circuits a sufficient condition for stability is that the total conductance in the circuit is positive formula_66 formula_67 so the VCNR is stable for

:Since VCNRs are even stable with a short-circuited output, they are called &quot;short circuit stable&quot;.

For general negative resistance circuits with reactance, the stability must be determined by standard tests like the Nyquist stability criterion. Alternatively, in high frequency circuit design, the values of formula_60 for which the circuit is stable are determined by a graphical technique using &quot;stability circles&quot; on a Smith chart.

===Operating regions and applications===
For simple nonreactive negative resistance devices with formula_69 and formula_70 the different operating regions of the device can be illustrated by load lines on the &quot;I–V&quot; curve &quot;(see graphs)&quot;.

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation formula_71 where formula_72 is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) (Q points) occur where the DC load line intersects the &quot;I–V&quot; curve. For stability
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias , such as a voltage source.
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias such as a current source, or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (&quot;L&quot;1 − &quot;L&quot;3) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance formula_73 facing the device. Increasing formula_73 rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions &quot;(see diagrams)&quot;, depending on formula_73.
*Stable region (green) (illustrated by line &quot;L&quot;1): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the &quot;I–V&quot; curve at one point &quot;Q&quot;1. For nonreactive circuits it is a stable equilibrium (poles in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance amplifiers operate in this region. However, due to hysteresis, with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear relaxation oscillator (astable multivibrator) or a monostable multivibrator.
**VCNRs are stable when formula_76.
**CCNRs are stable when formula_77.
*Unstable point (Line &quot;L&quot;2): When formula_78 the load line is tangent to the &quot;I–V&quot; curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the &quot;jω&quot; axis), so it is unstable and with a tuned circuit can oscillate. Linear oscillators operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to &quot;eventual passivity&quot; the negative resistance &quot;r&quot; decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where formula_79.
*Bistable region (red) (illustrated by line &quot;L&quot;3): In this region the load line can intersect the &quot;I–V&quot; curve at three points. The center point (&quot;Q&quot;1) is a point of unstable equilibrium (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, &quot;Q&quot;2 and &quot;Q&quot;3 are stable equilibria. So with correct biasing the circuit can be bistable, it will converge to one of the two points &quot;Q&quot;2 or &quot;Q&quot;3 and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like flip-flops (bistable multivibrators) and Schmitt triggers operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when formula_77
**CCNRs can be bistable when formula_76

== Active resistors – negative resistance from feedback ==

In addition to the passive devices with intrinsic negative differential resistance above, circuits with amplifying devices like transistors or op amps can have negative resistance at their ports. The input or output impedance of an amplifier with enough positive feedback applied to it can be negative. If formula_82 is the input resistance of the amplifier without feedback, formula_83 is the amplifier gain, and formula_84 is the transfer function of the feedback path, the input resistance with positive shunt feedback is
formula_85
So if the loop gain formula_86 is greater than one, formula_87 will be negative. The circuit acts like a &quot;negative linear resistor&quot; over a limited range, with &quot;I–V&quot; curve having a straight line segment through the origin with negative slope &quot;(see graphs)&quot;. It has both negative differential resistance and is active
formula_88
and thus obeys Ohm&#x27;s law as if it had a negative value of resistance −&quot;R&quot;, over its linear range (such amplifiers can also have more complicated negative resistance &quot;I–V&quot; curves that do not pass through the origin).

In circuit theory these are called &quot;active resistors&quot;. Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current &quot;out&quot; of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor. For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to charge rather than discharge.

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be DC coupled,
*the amount of negative resistance can be varied by adjusting the loop gain,
*they can be linear circuit elements; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause harmonic distortion.
The &quot;I–V&quot; curve can have voltage-controlled (&quot;N&quot; type) or current-controlled (&quot;S&quot; type) negative resistance, depending on whether the feedback loop is connected in &quot;shunt&quot; or &quot;series&quot;.

Negative reactances &quot;(below)&quot; can also be created, so feedback circuits can be used to create &quot;active&quot; linear circuit elements, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, with negative values. They are widely used in active filters because they can create transfer functions that cannot be realized with positive circuit elements. Examples of circuits with this type of negative resistance are the negative impedance converter (NIC), gyrator, Deboo integrator, frequency dependent negative resistance (FDNR), and generalized immittance converter (GIC).

===Feedback oscillators===
If an LC circuit is connected across the input of a positive feedback amplifier like that above, the negative differential input resistance formula_89 can cancel the positive loss resistance formula_90 inherent in the tuned circuit. If formula_91 this will create in effect a tuned circuit with zero AC resistance (poles on the &quot;jω&quot; axis). Spontaneous oscillation will be excited in the tuned circuit at its resonant frequency, sustained by the power from the amplifier. This is how feedback oscillators such as Hartley or Colpitts oscillators work. This negative resistance model is an alternate way of analyzing feedback oscillator operation. &quot;All&quot; linear oscillator circuits have negative resistance although in most feedback oscillators the tuned circuit is an integral part of the feedback network, so the circuit does not have negative resistance at all frequencies but only near the oscillation frequency.

===Q enhancement===
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so formula_92) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its poles toward the &quot;jω&quot; axis), increasing its Q factor so it has a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity. Q enhancement, also called &quot;regeneration&quot;, was first used in the regenerative radio receiver invented by Edwin Armstrong in 1912 and later in &quot;Q multipliers&quot;. It is widely used in active filters. For example, RF integrated circuits use &quot;integrated inductors&quot; to save space, consisting of a spiral conductor fabricated on chip. These have high losses and low Q, so to create high Q tuned circuits their Q is increased by applying negative resistance.

===Chaotic circuits===
Circuits which exhibit chaotic behavior can be considered quasi-periodic or nonperiodic oscillators, and like all oscillators require a negative resistance in the circuit to provide power. Chua&#x27;s circuit, a simple nonlinear circuit widely used as the standard example of a chaotic system, requires a nonlinear active resistor component, sometimes called Chua&#x27;s diode. This is usually synthesized using a negative impedance converter circuit.

===Negative impedance converter===
A common example of an &quot;active resistance&quot; circuit is the negative impedance converter (NIC) shown in the diagram. The two resistors formula_93 and the op amp constitute a negative feedback non-inverting amplifier with gain of 2. The output voltage of the op-amp is
formula_94
So if a voltage formula_5 is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied &quot;backwards&quot; across formula_96, causing current to flow through it out of the input. The current is
formula_97
So the input impedance to the circuit is
formula_98
The circuit converts the impedance formula_96 to its negative. If formula_96 is a resistor of value formula_30, within the linear range of the op amp formula_102 the input impedance acts like a linear &quot;negative resistor&quot; of value formula_103. The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component. An NIC can cancel undesired positive resistance in another circuit, for example they were originally developed to cancel resistance in telephone cables, serving as repeaters.

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing formula_96 in the above circuit with a capacitor , negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized. A negative capacitance will have an &quot;I–V&quot; relation and an impedance formula_105 of
formula_106
where formula_107. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to &quot;discharge&quot;; its voltage will &quot;decrease&quot;. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an &quot;I–V&quot; characteristic and impedance formula_108 of
formula_109
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit. NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor. Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are &quot;non-Foster&quot; circuits which violate Foster&#x27;s reactance theorem. One application being researched is to create an active matching network which could match an antenna to a transmission line over a broad range of frequencies, rather than just a single frequency as with current networks. This would allow the creation of small compact antennas that would have broad bandwidth, exceeding the Chu–Harrington limit.

==Oscillators==
Negative differential resistance devices are widely used to make electronic oscillators. In a negative resistance oscillator, a negative differential resistance device such as an IMPATT diode, Gunn diode, or microwave vacuum tube is connected across an electrical resonator such as an LC circuit, a quartz crystal, dielectric resonator or cavity resonator with a DC source to bias the device into its negative resistance region and provide power. A resonator such as an LC circuit is &quot;almost&quot; an oscillator; it can store oscillating electrical energy, but because all resonators have internal resistance or other losses, the oscillations are damped and decay to zero. The negative resistance cancels the positive resistance of the resonator, creating in effect a lossless resonator, in which spontaneous continuous oscillations occur at the resonator&#x27;s resonant frequency.

===Uses===
Negative resistance oscillators are mainly used at high frequencies in the microwave range or above, since feedback oscillators function poorly at these frequencies. Microwave diodes are used in low- to medium-power oscillators for applications such as radar speed guns, and local oscillators for satellite receivers. They are a widely used source of microwave energy, and virtually the only solid-state source of millimeter wave and terahertz energy Negative resistance microwave vacuum tubes such as magnetrons produce higher power outputs, in such applications as radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Lower frequency relaxation oscillators can be made with UJTs and gas-discharge lamps such as neon lamps.

The negative resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes but can also be applied to feedback oscillator circuits with two port devices such as transistors and tubes. In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port negative resistance devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port. So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.

===Gunn diode oscillator===

The common Gunn diode oscillator &quot;(circuit diagrams)&quot; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode &quot;D&quot; has voltage controlled (&quot;N&quot; type) negative resistance and the voltage source formula_110 biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is formula_111. The choke &quot;RFC&quot; prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source. formula_30 is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit formula_113, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with Kirchhoff&#x27;s Voltage Law gives a differential equation for formula_114, the AC current
formula_115
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form
formula_116 where formula_117
This shows that the current through the circuit, formula_114, varies with time about the DC Q point, formula_119. When started from a nonzero initial current formula_120 the current oscillates sinusoidally at the resonant frequency ω of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing exponentially, depending on the value of α. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between formula_30 and formula_31, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:
#formula_123: (poles in left half plane) If the diode&#x27;s negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance formula_30 and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit. So the circuit does not oscillate.
#formula_125: (poles on jω axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude. This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#formula_126: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude. This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started. A widely used rule of thumb is to make formula_127. When the power is turned on, electrical noise in the circuit provides a signal formula_128 to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering formula_31 to be the &quot;average&quot; resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance formula_31 becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance formula_131 and the damping formula_132 becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when formula_133.

Gunn diodes have negative resistance in the range −5 to −25 ohms. In oscillators where formula_30 is close to formula_31; just small enough to allow the oscillator to start, the voltage swing will be mostly limited to the linear portion of the &quot;I–V&quot; curve, the output waveform will be nearly sinusoidal and the frequency will be most stable. In circuits in which formula_30 is far below formula_31, the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe, and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage.

===Types of circuit===
Negative resistance oscillator circuits can be divided into two types, which are used with the two types of negative differential resistance – voltage controlled (VCNR), and current controlled (CCNR)

*Negative resistance (voltage controlled) oscillator: Since VCNR (&quot;N&quot; type) devices require a low impedance bias and are stable for load impedances less than &quot;r&quot;, the ideal oscillator circuit for this device has the form shown at top right, with a voltage source &quot;V&quot;bias to bias the device into its negative resistance region, and parallel resonant circuit load &quot;LC&quot;. The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.
*Negative conductance (current controlled) oscillator: CCNR (&quot;S&quot; type) devices, in contrast, require a high impedance bias and are stable for load impedances greater than &quot;r&quot;. The ideal oscillator circuit is like that at bottom right, with a current source bias &quot;I&quot;bias (which may consist of a voltage source in series with a large resistor) and series resonant circuit &quot;LC&quot;. The series LC circuit has low impedance only at its resonant frequency and so will only oscillate there.
===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (&quot;X&quot;) as well as resistance (&quot;R&quot;). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a frequency domain technique due to Kaneyuki Kurokawa. The circuit diagram is imagined to be divided by a &quot;reference plane&quot; &quot;(red)&quot; which separates the negative resistance part, the active device, from the positive resistance part, the resonant circuit and output load &quot;(right)&quot;. The complex impedance of the negative resistance part formula_138 depends on frequency &quot;ω&quot; but is also nonlinear, in general declining with the amplitude of the AC oscillation current &quot;I&quot;; while the resonator part formula_139 is linear, depending only on frequency. The circuit equation is formula_140 so it will only oscillate (have nonzero &quot;I&quot;) at the frequency &quot;ω&quot; and amplitude &quot;I&quot; for which the total impedance formula_141 is zero. This means the magnitude of the negative and positive resistances must be equal, and the reactances must be conjugate
formula_142 and formula_143
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the reflection coefficient. The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component &quot;V&quot;1 travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component &quot;V&quot;2 travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device formula_144 is greater than one, while that of the resonator part formula_145 is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if
formula_146
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the Barkhausen criterion for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient, so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions, which are often used instead.

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make amplifiers, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators. Because negative resistance devices have only one &quot;port&quot; (two terminals), unlike two-port devices such as transistors, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it. Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is &quot;bilateral&quot;; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems. To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and directional couplers.

===Reflection amplifier===
One widely used circuit is the &quot;reflection amplifier&quot; in which the separation is accomplished by a &quot;circulator&quot;. A circulator is a nonreciprocal solid-state component with three ports (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode &quot;N&quot; is attached through a filter &quot;F&quot; to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing &quot;reflected&quot; amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance formula_147 of the input and output transmission lines, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter &quot;F&quot; is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
formula_148
The output power from the diode is
formula_149
So the power gain formula_150 of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient
formula_151

formula_152
formula_153
formula_154 is the negative resistance of the diode −&quot;r&quot;. Assuming the filter is matched to the diode so formula_155 then the gain is
formula_156
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for formula_157. while a CCNR amplifier is stable for formula_158. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as formula_159 approaches the point of oscillation at formula_31. This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers, contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward &quot;leakage&quot; coupling between circulator ports.

Masers and parametric amplifiers are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like radio telescopes.

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in switching circuits in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with hysteresis. The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a relaxation oscillator, flip-flop or memory cell can be built with a single active device, whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the Eccles-Jordan multivibrator, requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*&quot;Astable multivibrator&quot; – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a relaxation oscillator, and can produce square waves or triangle waves.
*&quot;Monostable multivibrator&quot; – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*&quot;Bistable multivibrator&quot; or &quot;flip flop&quot; – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and digital counters.

==Other applications==
===Neuronal models===
Some instances of neurons display regions of negative slope conductances (RNSC) in voltage-clamp experiments. The negative resistance here is implied were one to consider the neuron a typical Hodgkin–Huxley style circuit model.

==History==
Negative resistance was first recognized during investigations of electric arcs, which were used for lighting during the 19th century. In 1881 Alfred Niaudet had observed that the voltage across arc electrodes decreased temporarily as the arc current increased, but many researchers thought this was a secondary effect due to temperature. The term &quot;negative resistance&quot; was applied by some to this effect, but the term was controversial because it was known that the resistance of a passive device could not be negative. Beginning in 1895 Hertha Ayrton, extending her husband William&#x27;s research with a series of meticulous experiments measuring the &quot;I–V&quot; curve of arcs, established that the curve had regions of negative slope, igniting controversy. Frith and Rodgers in 1896 with the support of the Ayrtons introduced the concept of &quot;differential&quot; resistance, &quot;dv/di&quot;, and it was slowly accepted that arcs had negative differential resistance. In recognition of her research, Hertha Ayrton became the first woman voted for induction into the Institute of Electrical Engineers.

===Arc transmitters===
George Francis FitzGerald first realized in 1892 that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, it would produce continuous oscillations. In the same year Elihu Thomson built a negative resistance oscillator by connecting an LC circuit to the electrodes of an arc, perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. William Duddell, a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson&#x27;s arc oscillator to public attention. Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and arc lights would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an LC circuit across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc. To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it. Duddell&#x27;s &quot;singing arc&quot; oscillator was limited to audio frequencies. However, in 1903 Danish engineers Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field, inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, which was widely used until the 1920s.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it. Heinrich Barkhausen in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance. Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that mercury vapor lamps could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying repeaters for telephone lines.

In 1918 Albert Hull at GE discovered that vacuum tubes could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called secondary emission. In a vacuum tube when electrons strike the plate electrode they can knock additional electrons out of the surface into the tube. This represents a current &quot;away&quot; from the plate, reducing the plate current. Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a &quot;decrease&quot; in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the dynatron oscillator. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the magnetron invented by Hull in 1920.

The negative impedance converter originated from work by Marius Latour around 1920. He was also one of the first to report negative capacitance and inductance. A decade later, vacuum tube NICs were developed as telephone line repeaters at Bell Labs by George Crisson and others, which made transcontinental telephone service possible. Transistor NICs, pioneered by Linvill in 1953, initiated a great increase in interest in NICs and many new circuits and applications developed.

===Solid state devices===
Negative differential resistance in semiconductors was observed around 1909 in the first point-contact junction diodes, called cat&#x27;s whisker detectors, by researchers such as William Henry Eccles and G. W. Pickard. They noticed that when junctions were biased with a DC voltage to improve their sensitivity as radio detectors, they would sometimes break into spontaneous oscillations. However the effect was not pursued.

The first person to exploit negative resistance diodes practically was Russian radio researcher Oleg Losev, who in 1922 discovered negative differential resistance in biased zincite (zinc oxide) point contact junctions. He used these to build solid-state amplifiers, oscillators, and amplifying and regenerative radio receivers, 25 years before the invention of the transistor. Later he even built a superheterodyne receiver. However his achievements were overlooked because of the success of vacuum tube technology. After ten years he abandoned research into this technology (dubbed &quot;Crystodyne&quot; by Hugo Gernsback), and it was forgotten.

The first widely used solid-state negative resistance device was the tunnel diode, invented in 1957 by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki. Because they have lower parasitic capacitance than vacuum tubes due to their small junction size, diodes can function at higher frequencies, and tunnel diode oscillators proved able to produce power at microwave frequencies, above the range of ordinary vacuum tube oscillators. Its invention set off a search for other negative resistance semiconductor devices for use as microwave oscillators, resulting in the discovery of the IMPATT diode, Gunn diode, TRAPATT diode, and others. In 1969 Kurokawa derived conditions for stability in negative resistance circuits. Currently negative differential resistance diode oscillators are the most widely used sources of microwave energy, and many new negative resistance devices have been discovered in recent decades.

<text>Johann Gottfried Schweighäuser () (2 January 1776, Strasbourg –14 March 1844) was a French philologist and archaeologist. He was the son of classicist Johann Schweighäuser.

At the age of 13 he began his studies of philosophy at the University of Strasbourg. In 1792 he volunteered with the French armed forces, subsequently being involved in a number of war-related events in the Palatinate. After his discharge from military service, he relocated to Paris, where in 1799, he was for a short period of time, a tutor in the home of Wilhelm von Humboldt. According to Paul Louis Courier, his father sent him to England to collate a manuscript for his edition of Athenaeus.

In 1812 he became a professor at the Protestant seminary in Strasbourg, and three years later succeeded his father as librarian at the munincipal and seminary libraries. In 1824 he took over his father&#x27;s chair at the University of Strasbourg.

In 1822 he became a correspondent member of the &quot;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres&quot;.

== Published works == 
He was joint-author with Philippe de Golbéry of &quot;Antiquités de l&#x27;Alsace&quot; (1828). Other noted works by Schweighäuser include:

<doc id="237780" wikidata="Q182536" url="?curid=237780" title="Swiss Psalm">
<text>The Swiss Psalm ( ; ; ; ) is the national anthem of Switzerland.

It was composed in 1841, by Alberich Zwyssig (1808–1854). Since then, it has been frequently sung at patriotic events. The Federal Council declined, however, on numerous occasions to accept the psalm as the official anthem. This was because the council wanted the people to express their say on what they wanted as a national anthem. From 1961 to 1981, it provisionally replaced &quot;&quot; (&quot;When You Call, My Country&quot;; French &quot;; Italian &quot;, Romansh &quot;&quot;), the anthem by Johann Rudolf Wyss (1743–1818) that was set to the melody of &quot;God Save the King&quot;. On 1 April 1981, the Swiss Psalm was declared the official Swiss national anthem.

In 2014, the organized a public competition and unofficial vote to change the lyrics of the national anthem.

== History ==
The German-language patriotic song &quot; (French &quot;, Italian &quot;, Romansh &quot;), composed in 1811 by Johann Rudolf Wyss (1743–1818), was used as the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem from about 1850. The setting of the hymn to the British tune of &quot;God Save the King&quot; led to confusing situations when both countries&#x27; anthems were played. Therefore, it was replaced with another tune in 1961.


The Swiss Psalm was composed in 1841 by Alberich Zwyssig (1808–1854). Zwyssig used a tune he had composed in 1835 and slightly altered the words of a poem written in 1840 by (1809–1867).

In the second half of the 19th century, the song became popular and was frequently sung at patriotic celebrations. Between 1894 and 1953, there were repeated suggestions for it to be adopted as official national anthem. In this, it was in competition with &quot;Rufst du, mein Vaterland&quot;, a patriotic song that was widely seen as the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem but was never given official status.

The Swiss Psalm temporarily became the national anthem in 1961. After a trial period of three years, the Swiss tune was adopted indefinitely in 1965. The statute could not be challenged until ten years later but did not totally exclude the possibility of an ultimate change. A competition was set up in 1979 to search for a successor to the anthem. Despite many submissions, none of the others seemed to express the Swiss sentiment. The Swiss anthem finally got its definitive statutory status in April 1981, the Federal Council maintaining that it was purely a Swiss song suitably dignified and solemn. The popularity of the song has not been established. At least, it has been shown with several vox pops taken that many people do not know it at all, and only a small percentage can recite it all.

==Lyrics==
Because Switzerland has four national languages, the lyrics of the original German song were adapted into the other three national languages: French, Italian and Romansh.

== Proposals for a new anthem or new lyrics==
*1986: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Roll the drums!&quot;) by Henri-Frédéric Amiel was proposed by the Swiss National Alliance.
*Late 1990s: the Fondation Pro CH 98 tried to promote a new anthem composed by the Argovian Christian Daniel Jakob.
*2014: the started a public competition to find new lyrics for the national anthem. The instruction was to take inspiration from the preamble of the Federal Constitution of Switzerland. The jury received 208 proposals; it selected six of them and translated them in the four national languages of Switzerland. In March 2015, the six selected proposals were released on-line (with videos in four languages) and opened to public vote (until May 2015). The top three vote-getters were selected for a second on-line ballot between June and August. In September 2015, a televised final selected one set of lyrics. Finally, the Société suisse d&#x27;utilité publique will propose the winning lyrics to the federal authorities. As soon as the new hymn text is known enough, the Swiss Parliament and the electorate will be asked to determine it. As of 2017, the new lyrics have not been officially adopted. A version of the winning lyrics was also made by combining the four national languages of Switzerland. As 500,000 Swiss abroad and residents in Switzerland are native English speakers, the new hymn text has been translated not only into the four official Swiss languages but also into English. More information and the scores of the hymn can be found at: .

<doc id="237782" wikidata="Q25352" url="?curid=237782" title="White stork">
<text>The white stork (Ciconia ciconia) is a large bird in the stork family, Ciconiidae. Its plumage is mainly white, with black on the bird&#x27;s wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average from beak tip to end of tail, with a wingspan. The two subspecies, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe north to Finland, northwestern Africa, Palearctic east to southern Kazakhstan and southern Africa. The white stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water.

A carnivore, the white stork eats a wide range of animal prey, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and small birds. It takes most of its food from the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. It is a monogamous breeder, and both members of the pair build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years. Each year the female can lay one clutch of usually four eggs, which hatch 33–34 days after being laid. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and both feed the young. The young leave the nest 58–64 days after hatching, and continue to be fed by the parents for a further 7–20 days.

The white stork has been rated as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It benefited from human activities during the Middle Ages as woodland was cleared, but changes in farming methods and industrialisation saw it decline and disappear from parts of Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Conservation and reintroduction programs across Europe have resulted in the white stork resuming breeding in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It has few natural predators, but may harbour several types of parasite; the plumage is home to chewing lice and feather mites, while the large nests maintain a diverse range of mesostigmatic mites. This conspicuous species has given rise to many legends across its range, of which the best-known is the story of babies being brought by storks.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
English naturalist Francis Willughby wrote about the white stork in the 17th century, having seen a drawing sent to him by Sir Thomas Browne of Norwich. He named it &quot;Ciconia alba&quot;. They noted they were occasional vagrants to England, blown there by storms. It was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name of &quot;Ardea ciconia&quot;. It was reclassified to and designated the type species of the new genus &quot;Ciconia&quot; by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. Both the genus and specific epithet, &quot;cĭcōnia&quot;, are the Latin word for &quot;stork&quot;.

There are two subspecies:

* &quot;C. c. ciconia&quot;, the nominate subspecies described by Linnaeus in 1758, breeds from Europe to northwestern Africa and westernmost Asia and in southern Africa, and winters mainly in Africa south of the Sahara Desert, though some birds winter in India.
* &quot;C. c. asiatica&quot;, described by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov in 1873, breeds in Turkestan and winters from Iran to India. It is slightly larger than the nominate subspecies.

The stork family contains six genera in three broad groups: the open-billed and wood storks (&quot;Mycteria&quot; and &quot;Anastomus&quot;), the giant storks (&quot;Ephippiorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Jabiru&quot; and &quot;Leptoptilos&quot;) and the &quot;typical&quot; storks (&quot;Ciconia&quot;). The typical storks include the white stork and six other extant species, which are characterised by straight pointed beaks and mainly black and white plumage. Its closest relatives are the larger, black-billed Oriental stork (&quot;Ciconia boyciana&quot;) of East Asia, which was formerly classified as a subspecies of the white stork, and the maguari stork (&quot;C. maguari&quot;) of South America. Close evolutionary relationships within &quot;Ciconia&quot; are suggested by behavioural similarities and, biochemically, through analysis of both mitochondrial cytochrome &quot;b&quot; gene sequences and DNA-DNA hybridization.

A &quot;Ciconia&quot; fossil representing the distal end of a right humerus has been recovered from Miocene beds of Rusinga Island, Lake Victoria, Kenya. The 24–6 million year old fossil could have originated from either a white stork or a black stork (&quot;C. nigra&quot;), which are species of about the same size with very similar bone structures. The Middle Miocene beds of Maboko Island have yielded further remains.

== Description ==

The white stork is a large bird. It has a length of , and a standing height of . The wingspan is and its weight is . Like all storks, it has long legs, a long neck and a long straight pointed beak. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. The plumage is mainly white with black flight feathers and wing coverts; the black is caused by the pigment melanin. The breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The irises are dull brown or grey, and the peri-orbital skin is black. The adult has a bright red beak and red legs, the colouration of which is derived from carotenoids in the diet. In parts of Spain, studies have shown that the pigment is based on astaxanthin obtained from an introduced species of crayfish (&quot;Procambarus clarkii&quot;) and the bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings, in contrast to the duller beaks of young white storks elsewhere.

As with other storks, the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar. In flapping flight its wingbeats are slow and regular. It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail. It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched. In contrast, it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting. Moulting has not been extensively studied, but appears to take place throughout the year, with the primary flight feathers replaced over the breeding season.
Upon hatching, the young white stork is partly covered with short, sparse, whitish down feathers. This early down is replaced about a week later with a denser coat of woolly white down. By three weeks, the young bird acquires black scapulars and flight feathers. On hatching the chick has pinkish legs, which turn to greyish-black as it ages. Its beak is black with a brownish tip. By the time it fledges, the juvenile bird&#x27;s plumage is similar to that of the adult, though its black feathers are often tinged with brown, and its beak and legs are a duller brownish-red or orange. The beak is typically orange or red with a darker tip. The bills gain the adults&#x27; red colour the following summer, although the black tips persist in some individuals. Young storks adopt adult plumage by their second summer.

=== Similar species ===
Within its range the white stork is distinctive when seen on the ground. The winter range of &quot;C. c. asiatica&quot; overlaps that of the Asian openbill, which has similar plumage but a different bill shape. When seen at a distance in flight, the white stork can be confused with several other species with similar underwing patterns, such as the yellow-billed stork, great white pelican and Egyptian vulture. The yellow-billed stork is identified by its black tail and a longer, slightly curved, yellow beak. The white stork also tends to be larger than the yellow-billed stork. The great white pelican has short legs which do not extend beyond its tail, and it flies with its neck retracted, keeping its head near to its stocky body, giving it a different flight profile. Pelicans also behave differently, soaring in orderly, synchronised flocks rather than in disorganised groups of individuals as the white stork does. The Egyptian vulture is much smaller, with a long wedge-shaped tail, shorter legs and a small yellow-tinged head on a short neck. The common crane, which can also look black and white in strong light, shows longer legs and a longer neck in flight.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The nominate race of the white stork has a wide although disjunct summer range across Europe, clustered in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa in the west, and much of eastern and central Europe, with 25% of the world&#x27;s population concentrated in Poland, as well as parts of western Asia. The &quot;asiatica&quot; population of about 1450 birds is restricted to a region in central Asia between the Aral Sea and Xinjiang in western China. The Xinjiang population is believed to have become extinct around 1980. Migration routes extend the range of this species into many parts of Africa and India. Some populations adhere to the eastern migration route, which passes across Israel into eastern and central Africa.

In Africa the white stork may spend the winter in Tunisia, Morocco, Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe, Djibouti, Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, Swaziland, Gambia, Guinea, Algeria, and Ghana. A few records of breeding from South Africa have been known since 1933 at Calitzdorp, and about 10 birds have been known to breed since the 1990s around Bredasdorp. A small population of white storks winters in India and is thought to derive principally from the &quot;C. c. asiatica&quot; population as flocks of up to 200 birds have been observed on spring migration in the early 1900s through the Kurram Valley. However, birds ringed in Germany have been recovered in western (Bikaner) and southern (Tirunelveli) India. An atypical specimen with red orbital skin, a feature of the Oriental white stork, has been recorded and further study of the Indian population is required. North of the breeding range, it is a passage migrant or vagrant in Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Norway and Sweden, and west to the Azores and Madeira. Despite their geographical proximity, in Finland the species is rare, while in Estonia there are an estimated 5,000 breeding pairs. In recent years, the range has expanded into western Russia.

The white stork&#x27;s preferred feeding grounds are grassy meadows, farmland and shallow wetlands. It avoids areas overgrown with tall grass and shrubs. In the Chernobyl area of northern Ukraine, white stork populations declined after the 1986 nuclear accident there as farmland was succeeded by tall grass and shrubs. In parts of Poland, poor natural foraging grounds have forced birds to seek food at rubbish dumps since 1999. White storks have also been reported foraging in rubbish dumps in the Middle East, North Africa and South Africa. Anthropogenic litter was found in the pellets of one third of breeding pairs in Poland, even though all pairs nested far from major dumps and landfills.

The white stork breeds in greater numbers in areas with open grasslands, particularly grassy areas which are wet or periodically flooded, and less in areas with taller vegetation cover such as forest and shrubland. They make use of grasslands, wetlands, and farmland on the wintering grounds in Africa. White storks were probably aided by human activities during the Middle Ages as woodland was cleared and new pastures and farmland were created, and they were found across much of Europe, breeding as far north as Sweden. The population in Sweden is thought to have established in the 16th century after forests were cut down for agriculture. About 5000 pairs were estimated to breed in the 18th century which declined subsequently. The first accurate census in 1917 found 25 pairs and the last pair failed to breed around 1955. A similar pattern was seen in Denmark where the white stork appears to have become established in the 15th century when forests were being replaced by farmland and meadows, followed by a rapid population increase in the next centuries and then a rapid decline due mainly to modern, high-intensity agriculture in the last 200 years. The white stork has been a rare visitor to the British Isles, with about 20 birds seen in Britain every year, and prior to 2020 there were no records of nesting since a pair nested atop St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1416. In 2020, a pair bred in the United Kingdom for the first time in over 600 years, as part of a re-introduction initiative in West Sussex called the White Stork Project.

A decline in population began in the 19th century due to industrialisation and changes in agricultural methods. White storks no longer nest in many countries, and the current strongholds of the western population are in Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and Poland. In the Iberian Peninsula, populations are concentrated in the southwest, and have also declined due to agricultural practices. A study published in 2005 found that the Podhale region in the uplands of southern Poland had seen an influx of white storks, which first bred there in 1931 and have nested at progressively higher altitudes since, reaching 890 m (3000 ft) in 1999. The authors proposed that this was related to climate warming and the influx of other animals and plants to higher altitudes. White storks arriving in Poznań province (Greater Poland Voivodeship) in western Poland in spring to breed did so some 10 days earlier in the last twenty years of the 20th century than at the end of the 19th century.

=== Migration ===

Systematic research into migration of the white stork began with German ornithologist Johannes Thienemann who commenced bird ringing studies in 1906 at the Rossitten Bird Observatory, on the Curonian Spit in what was then East Prussia. Although not many storks passed through Rossitten itself, the observatory coordinated the large-scale ringing of the species throughout Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Between 1906 and the Second World War about 100,000, mainly juvenile, white storks were ringed, with over 2,000 long-distance recoveries of birds wearing Rossitten rings reported between 1908 and 1954.

==== Routes ====
White storks fly south from their summer breeding grounds in Europe in August and September, heading for Africa. There, they spend the winter in savannah from Kenya and Uganda south to the Cape Province of South Africa. In these areas, they congregate in large flocks which may exceed a thousand individuals. Some diverge westwards into western Sudan and Chad, and may reach Nigeria.
In spring, the birds return north; they are recorded from Sudan and Egypt from February to April. They arrive back in Europe around late March and April, after an average journey of 49 days. By comparison, the autumn journey is completed in about 26 days. Tailwinds and scarcity of food and water en route (birds fly faster over regions lacking resources) increase average speed.
To avoid a long sea crossing over the Mediterranean, birds from central Europe either follow an eastern migration route by crossing the Bosphorus in Turkey, traversing the Levant, then bypassing the Sahara Desert by following the Nile valley southwards, or follow a western route over the Strait of Gibraltar. These migration corridors maximise help from the thermals and thus save energy.
In winter 2013–2014, white storks were observed in southern India&#x27;s Mudumalai National Park for the first time.
The eastern route is by far the more important with 530,000 white storks using it annually, making the species the second commonest migrant there (after the European honey buzzard). The flocks of migrating raptors, white storks and great white pelicans can stretch for 200 km (125 mi). The eastern route is twice as long as the western, but storks take the same time to reach the wintering grounds by either.

Juvenile white storks set off on their first southward migration in an inherited direction but, if displaced from that bearing by weather conditions, they are unable to compensate, and may end up in a new wintering location. Adults can compensate for strong winds and adjust their direction to finish at their normal winter sites, because they are familiar with the location. For the same reason, all spring migrants, even those from displaced wintering locations, can find their way back to the traditional breeding sites. An experiment with young birds raised in captivity in Kaliningrad and released in the absence of wild storks to show them the way revealed that they appeared to have an instinct to fly south, although the scatter in direction was large.

==== Energetics ====

White storks rely on the uplift of air thermals to soar and glide the long distances of their annual migrations between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. For many, the shortest route would take them over the Mediterranean Sea; however, since air thermals do not form over water, they generally detour over land to avoid the trans-Mediterranean flights that would require prolonged energetic wing flapping. It has been estimated that flapping flight metabolises 23 times more body fat than soaring flight per distance travelled. Thus, flocks spiral upwards on rising warm air until they emerge at the top, up to above the ground (though one record from Western Sudan observed an altitude of ).

Long flights over water may occasionally be undertaken. A young white stork ringed at the nest in Denmark subsequently appeared in England, where it spent some days before moving on. It was later seen flying over St Mary&#x27;s, Isles of Scilly, and arrived in a poor condition in Madeira three days later. That island is 500 km (320 mi) from Africa, and twice as far from the European mainland. Migration through the Middle East may be hampered by the &quot;khamsin&quot;, winds bringing gusty overcast days unsuitable for flying. In these situations, flocks of white storks sit out the adverse weather on the ground, standing and facing into the wind.

== Behaviour ==

The white stork is a bird; flocks of thousands of individuals have been recorded on migration routes and at wintering areas in Africa. Non-breeding birds gather in groups of 40 or 50 during the breeding season. The smaller dark-plumaged Abdim&#x27;s stork is often encountered with white stork flocks in southern Africa. Breeding pairs of white stork may gather in small groups to hunt, and colony nesting has been recorded in some areas. However, groups among white stork colonies vary widely in size and the social structure is loosely defined; young breeding storks are often restricted to peripheral nests, while older storks attain higher breeding success while occupying the better quality nests toward the centres of breeding colonies. Social structure and group cohesion is maintained by altruistic behaviours such as allopreening. White storks exhibit this behaviour exclusively at the nest site. Standing birds preen the heads of sitting birds, sometimes these are parents grooming juveniles, and sometimes juveniles preen each other. Unlike most storks, it never adopts a spread-winged posture, though it is known to droop its wings (holding them away from its body with the primary feathers pointing downwards) when its plumage is wet.

A white stork&#x27;s droppings, containing faeces and uric acid, are sometimes directed onto its own legs, making them appear white. The resulting evaporation provides cooling and is termed urohidrosis. Birds that have been ringed can sometimes be affected by the accumulation of droppings around the ring leading to constriction and leg trauma. The white stork has also been noted for tool use by squeezing moss in the beak to drip water into the mouths of its chicks.

=== Communication ===
The adult white stork&#x27;s main sound is noisy bill-clattering, which has been likened to distant machine gun fire. The bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a knocking sound is made each time its beak closes. The clattering is amplified by its throat pouch, which acts as a resonator. Used in a variety of social interactions, bill-clattering generally grows louder the longer it lasts, and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on the situation—for example, slower during copulation and briefer when given as an alarm call. The only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss; however, young birds can generate a harsh hiss, various cheeping sounds, and a cat-like mew they use to beg for food. Like the adults, young also clatter their beaks. The &quot;up-down display&quot; is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. Here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, post coitus, and also as a threat display. Breeding pairs are territorial over the summer, and use this display, as well as crouching forward with the tails cocked and wings extended.

=== Breeding and lifespan ===
The white stork breeds in open farmland areas with access to marshy wetlands, building a large stick nest in trees, on buildings, or on purpose-built man-made platforms. Each nest is in depth, in diameter, and in weight. Nests are built in loose colonies. Not persecuted as it is viewed as a good omen, it often nests close to human habitation; in southern Europe, nests can be seen on churches and other buildings. The nest is typically used year after year especially by older males. The males arrive earlier in the season and choose the nests. Larger nests are associated with greater numbers of young successfully fledged, and appear to be sought after. Nest change is often related to a change in the pairing and failure to raise young the previous year, and younger birds are more likely to change nesting sites. Although a pair may be found to occupy a nest, partners may change several times during the early stages and breeding activities begin only after a stable pairing is achieved.

Several bird species often nest within the large nests of the white stork. Regular occupants are house sparrows, tree sparrows, and common starlings; less common residents include Eurasian kestrels, little owls, European rollers, white wagtails, black redstarts, Eurasian jackdaws, and Spanish sparrows. Active nests may attract insectivorous birds such as swallows, martins, and swifts, where they prey on insects flying around. Paired birds greet by engaging in up-down and head-shaking crouch displays, and clattering the beak while throwing back the head. Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid. High-frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra-pair copulation. It has been considered that extra-pair copulation rates were low but a 2016 DNA sample study suggests that extra-pair copulation occasionally occurs in white storks. Despite the relatively high extra-pair paternity occurrence compared to other long-lived monogamous birds, white storks form strong pair bonds and high nest fidelity maintained across years.

A white stork pair raises a single brood a year. The female typically lays four eggs, though clutches of one to seven have been recorded. The eggs are white, but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutinous covering. They typically measure , and weigh , of which about is shell. Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid, so the brood hatches asynchronously, beginning 33 to 34 days later. The first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over the others. While stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings, as is the case in some species, weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents. This behavior occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. White stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents&#x27; feeding method (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. Despite this, this behavior has not commonly been observed.

The temperature and weather around the time of hatching in spring is important; cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates. Somewhat unexpectedly, studies have found that later-hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier-hatching nestmates. The body weight of the chicks increases rapidly in the first few weeks and reaches a plateau of about in 45 days. The length of the beak increases linearly for about 50 days. Young birds are fed with earthworms and insects, which are regurgitated by the parents onto the floor of the nest. Older chicks reach into the mouths of parents to obtain food. Chicks fledge 58 to 64 days after hatching.

White storks generally begin breeding when about four years old, although the age of first breeding has been recorded as early as two years and as late as seven years. The oldest known wild white stork lived for 39 years after being ringed in Switzerland, while captive birds have lived for more than 35 years.

=== Feeding ===
White storks consume a wide variety of animal prey. They prefer to forage in meadows that are within roughly 5 km (3 mi) of their nest and sites where the vegetation is shorter so that their prey is more accessible. Their diet varies according to season, locality and prey availability. Common food items include insects (primarily beetles, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets), earthworms, reptiles, amphibians, particularly frog species such as the edible frog (&quot;Pelophylax&quot; kl. &quot;esculentus&quot;) and common frog (&quot;Rana temporaria&quot;) and small mammals such as voles, moles and shrews. Less commonly, they also eat bird eggs and young birds, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and scorpions. They hunt mainly during the day, swallowing small prey whole, but killing and breaking apart larger prey before swallowing. Rubber bands are mistaken for earthworms and consumed, occasionally resulting in fatal blockage of the digestive tract.

Birds returning to Latvia during spring have been shown to locate their prey, moor frogs (&quot;Rana arvalis&quot;), by homing in on the mating calls produced by aggregations of male frogs.

The diet of non-breeding birds is similar to that of breeding birds, but food items are more often taken from dry areas. White storks wintering in western India have been observed to follow blackbuck to capture insects disturbed by them. Wintering white storks in India sometimes forage along with the woolly-necked stork (&quot;Ciconia episcopus&quot;). Food piracy has been recorded in India with a rodent captured by a western marsh harrier appropriated by a white stork, while Montagu&#x27;s harrier is known to harass white storks foraging for voles in some parts of Poland. White storks can exploit landfill sites for food during the breeding season, migration period and winter.

== Parasites and diseases ==
White stork nests are habitats for an array of small arthropods, particularly over the warmer months after the birds arrive to breed. Nesting over successive years, the storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them. Not only do their bodies tend to regulate temperatures within the nest, but excrement, food remains and feather and skin fragments provide nourishment for a large and diverse population of free-living mesostigmatic mites. A survey of twelve nests found 13,352 individuals of 34 species, the most common being &quot;Macrocheles merdarius&quot;, &quot;M. robustulus&quot;, &quot;Uroobovella pyriformis&quot; and &quot;Trichouropoda orbicularis&quot;, which together represented almost 85% of all the specimens collected. These feed on the eggs and larvae of insects and on nematodes, which are abundant in the nest litter. These mites are dispersed by coprophilous beetles, often of the family Scarabaeidae, or on dung brought by the storks during nest construction. Parasitic mites do not occur, perhaps being controlled by the predatory species. The overall effect of the mite population is unclear, the mites may have a role in suppressing harmful organisms (and hence be beneficial), or they may themselves have an adverse effect on nestlings.

The birds themselves host species belonging to more than four genera of feather mites. These mites, including &quot;Freyanopterolichus pelargicus&quot;, and &quot;Pelargolichus didactylus&quot; live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil. Chewing lice such as &quot;Colpocephalum zebra&quot; tend to be found on the wings, and &quot;Neophilopterus incompletus&quot; elsewhere on the body.

The white stork also carries several types of internal parasites, including &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; and intestinal parasites of the genus &quot;Giardia&quot;. A study of 120 white stork carcasses from Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg in Germany yielded eight species of trematode (fluke), four cestode (tapeworm) species, and at least three species of nematode. One species of fluke, &quot;Chaunocephalus ferox&quot;, caused lesions in the wall of the small intestine in a number of birds admitted to two rehabilitation centres in central Spain, and was associated with reduced weight. It is a recognised pathogen and cause of morbidity in the Asian openbill (&quot;Anastomus oscitans&quot;). More recently, the thorough study performed by J. Sitko and P. Heneberg in the Czech Republic in 1962–2013 suggested that the central European white storks host 11 helminth species. &quot;Chaunocephalus ferox&quot;, &quot;Tylodelphys excavata&quot; and &quot;Dictymetra discoidea&quot; were reported to be the dominant ones. The other species found included &quot;Cathaemasia hians&quot;, &quot;Echinochasmus spinulosus&quot;, &quot;Echinostoma revolutum&quot;, &quot;Echinostoma sudanense&quot;, &quot;Duboisia syriaca&quot;, &quot;Apharyngostrigea cornu&quot;, &quot;Capillaria&quot; sp. and &quot;Dictymetra discoidea&quot;. Juvenile white storks were shown to host less species, but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adult storks.

West Nile virus (WNV) is mainly a bird infection that is transmitted between birds by mosquitos. Migrating birds appear to be important in spread of the virus, the ecology of which remains poorly known. On 26 August 1998, a flock of about 1,200 migrating white storks that had been blown off course on their southward journey landed in Eilat, in southern Israel. The flock was stressed as it had resorted to flapping flight to return to its migratory route, and a number of birds died. A virulent strain of West Nile virus was isolated from the brains of eleven dead juveniles. Other white storks subsequently tested in Israel have shown anti-WNV antibodies. In 2008 three juvenile white storks from a Polish wildlife refuge yielded seropositive results indicating exposure to the virus, but the context or existence of the virus in Poland is unclear.

== Conservation ==
The white stork&#x27;s decline due to industrialisation and agricultural changes (principally the draining of wetlands and conversion of meadows to crops such as maize) began in the 19th century: the last wild individual in Belgium was seen in 1895, in Sweden in 1955, in Switzerland in 1950 and in the Netherlands in 1991. However, the species has since been reintroduced to many regions. It has been rated as least concern by the IUCN since 1994, after being evaluated as near threatened in 1988. The white stork is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Parties to the agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. Threats include the continued loss of wetlands, collisions with overhead power lines, use of persistent pesticides (such as DDT) to combat locusts in Africa, and largely illegal hunting on migration routes and wintering grounds.

A large population of white storks breeds in central (Poland, Ukraine and Germany) and southern Europe (Spain and Turkey). In a 2004/05 census, there were 52,500 pairs in Poland, 30,000 pairs in Ukraine, 20,000 pairs in Belarus, 13,000 pairs in Lithuania (the highest known density of this species in the world), 10,700 pairs in Latvia, and 10,200 in Russia. There were around 5,500 pairs in Romania, 5,300 in Hungary, and an estimated 4,956 breeding pairs in Bulgaria. In former Yugoslavia there are 1,700 in Croatia, 1,400 in Serbia, 236 in Slovenia and an estimated 40 breeding pairs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Germany, the majority of the total 4,482 pairs were in the eastern region, especially in the states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (1296 and 863 pairs in 2008 respectively). Apart from Spain and Portugal (33,217 and 7,684 pairs in 2004/05 respectively), populations are generally much less stable. In the eastern Mediterranean region Turkey has a sizeable population of 6,195 pairs, and Greece 2,139 pairs. In Western Europe the white stork remains a rare bird despite conservation efforts. In 2004 France had only 973 pairs, and the Netherlands 528 pairs. In Denmark, the species had consistently bred since the 15th century, peaking at several thousands pairs around 1800. Afterwards it began declining mainly due to habitat loss (especially conversion of wetlands and meadows into modern farming), with only a few tens of breeding pairs in 1974 and none in 2008. Since then, it has reestablished itself and the population has slowly started to increase, reaching ten pairs in 2023. In Armenia the population of the white stork slightly increased in the period between 2005 and 2015, and by last data reached 652 pairs.

In the early 1980s, the population had fallen to fewer than nine pairs in the entire upper Rhine River valley, an area closely identified with the white stork for centuries. Conservation efforts successfully increased the population of birds there to 270 pairs (in 2008), largely due to the actions of the Association for the Protection and Reintroduction of Storks in Alsace and Lorraine. The reintroduction of zoo-reared birds has halted further declines in Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. There were 601 pairs breeding in Armenia and around 700 pairs in the Netherlands in 2008, and few pairs also breed in South Africa, typically recent colonists from within the normal wintering population. In Poland, electric poles have been modified with a platform at the top to prevent the white stork&#x27;s large nest from disrupting the electricity supply, and sometimes nests are moved from an electric pole to a man-made platform. Introductions of zoo-reared birds in the Netherlands has been followed up by feeding and nest-building programs by volunteers. Similar reintroduction programs are taking place in Sweden, and Switzerland, where 175 pairs were recorded breeding in 2000. Long-term viability of the population in Switzerland is unclear as breeding success rates are low, and supplementary feeding does not appear to be of benefit. However, as of 2017, 470 adults and 757 young ones were recorded in Switzerland. Historically, the species&#x27; northern breeding limit was at Estonia, but it has moved slowly northwards (possibly due to warmer temperatures) into Karelia and in 2015 the first ever known breeding happened in Finland.

In August 2019, 24 juveniles were released at the Knepp Estate in West Sussex, and others at a site near Tunbridge Wells and at the Wintershall Estate, near Godalming, as part of a project to reintroduce the white stork as a breeding species in South East England, for the first time since 1416. In 2020, the program was successful with the birth of five baby storks.

== Cultural associations ==

Due to its large size, predation on vermin, and nesting behaviour close to human settlements and on rooftops, the white stork has an imposing presence that has influenced human culture and folklore. The Hebrew word for the white stork is &quot;chasidah&quot; (חסידה), meaning &quot;merciful&quot; or &quot;kind&quot;. Greek and Roman mythology portray storks as models of parental devotion. The 3rd century Roman writer Aelian citing the authority of Alexander of Myndus noted in his &quot;De natura animalium&quot; (book 3, chapter 23) that aged storks flew away to oceanic islands where they were transformed into humans as a reward for their piety towards their parents. The bird is featured in at least three of Aesop&#x27;s Fables: The Fox and the Stork, The Farmer and the Stork, and The Frogs Who Desired a King. Storks were also thought to care for their aged parents, feeding them and even transporting them, and children&#x27;s books depicted them as a model of filial values. A Greek law called &quot;Pelargonia&quot;, from the Ancient Greek word &quot;pelargos&quot; for stork, required citizens to take care of their aged parents. The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death. Storks were allegedly protected in Ancient Thessaly as they hunted snakes, and widely held to be Virgil&#x27;s &quot;white bird&quot;. Roman writers noted the white stork&#x27;s arrival in spring, which alerted farmers to plant their vines. On occasion ancient Egyptians mummified White storks.

Followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual pilgrimage to Mecca on their migration. Some of the earliest understanding on bird migration were initiated by an interest in white storks; &quot;Pfeilstörche&quot; (&quot;arrow storks&quot;) were found in Europe with African arrows embedded in their bodies. A well-known example of such a stork found in the summer of 1822 in the German town of Klütz in Mecklenburg was made into a mounted taxidermy specimen, complete with the ornate African arrow, that is now in the University of Rostock.

Storks have little fear of humans if not disturbed, and often nest on buildings in Europe. In Germany, the presence of a nest on a house was believed to protect against fires. They were also protected because of the belief that their souls were human. German, Dutch and Polish households would encourage storks to nest on houses, sometimes by constructing purpose-built high platforms, to bring good luck. Across much of Central and Eastern Europe it is believed that storks bring harmony to a family on whose property they nest.

The white stork is a popular motif on postage stamps, and it is featured on more than 120 stamps issued by more than 60 stamp-issuing entities. It is the national bird of Lithuania, Belarus and Poland, and it was a Polish mascot at the Expo 2000 Fair in Hanover. Storks nesting in Polish villages such as Żywkowo have made them tourist attractions, drawing 2000–5000 visitors a year in 2014. In the 19th century, storks were also thought to only live in countries having a republican form of government. Polish poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid mentioned storks in his poem &quot;Moja piosnka (II)&quot; (&quot;My Song (II)&quot;):

In 1942 Heinrich Himmler sought to use storks to carry Nazi propaganda leaflets so as to win support from the Boers in South Africa. The idea for this &quot;Storchbein-Propaganda&quot; plan was a secret that was transmitted by Walter Schellenberg to be examined by the German ornithologist Ernst Schüz at the Rossiten bird observatory, who pointed out that the probability of finding marked storks in Africa was less than one percent, requiring a 1000 birds to transmit 10 leaflets successfully. The plan was then dropped.

=== Storks and delivery of babies===
According to European folklore, the stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents. The legend is very ancient, but was popularised by a 19th-century Hans Christian Andersen story called &quot;The Storks&quot;. German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks. These caves contained &quot;adebarsteine&quot; or &quot;stork stones&quot;. The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney. Households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for the stork on the window sill. From there the folklore has spread around the world to the Philippines and countries in South America. Birthmarks on the back of the head of newborn baby, &quot;nevus flammeus nuchae&quot;, are sometimes referred to as stork-bite.

In Slavic mythology and pagan religion, storks were thought to carry unborn souls from Vyraj to Earth in spring and summer. This belief still persists in the modern folk culture of many Slavic countries, in the simplified child story that &quot;storks bring children into the world&quot;. Storks were seen by Early Slavs as bringing luck, and killing one would bring misfortune.

Likewise, in Norse mythology, the god Hœnir, responsible for giving reason to the first humans, Ask and Embla, has been connected with the stork through his epithets &quot;long-legs&quot; and &quot;mud-king&quot;, along with Indo-European cognates such as Greek &#x27;swan&#x27; and Sanskrit .

A long-term study that showed a spurious correlation between the numbers of stork nests and human births is widely used in the teaching of basic statistics as an example to highlight that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation.

Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggested that the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need, in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children. Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses, such as Juno, to the Holy Spirit, and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage depicting purity, size, and flight at high altitude likened to flying between Earth and Heaven. The fable and its relation to the internal world of the child have been discussed by Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. In fact, Jung recalled being told the story himself upon the birth of his own sister. The traditional link with the newborn continues with their use in advertising for such products as nappies and baby announcements.

There were negative aspects to stork folklore as well; a Polish folk tale relates how God made the stork&#x27;s plumage white, while the Devil gave it black wings, imbuing it with both good and evil impulses. They were also associated with handicapped or stillborn babies in Germany, explained as the stork having dropped the baby en route to the household, or as revenge or punishment for past wrongdoing. A mother who was confined to bed around the time of childbirth was said to have been &quot;bitten&quot; by the stork. In Denmark, storks were said to toss a nestling off the nest and then an egg in successive years. In medieval England, storks were also associated with adultery, possibly inspired by their courtship rituals. Their preening and posture saw them linked with the attribute of self-conceit. Children of African American slaves were sometimes told that white babies were brought by storks, while black babies were born from buzzard eggs.

<text>Port of Big Creek is the only deep-water port facility on the in Country of Belize (just south of the boundary with Stann Creek District), constructed in the 1990s. It is the nation&#x27;s largest private port., after Belize City. Big Creek is the main port for Belize&#x27;s banana industry; citrus fruit and shrimp are also exported from here. It is also the location from which oil, extracted from the fields of Spanish Lookout, is exported.

==Facilities==
The port is ISPS certified and has 3 berths. Cargoes handled include bananas, citrus fruit and petroleum.
==Hurricanes==
The port is not a designated safe harbour with regard to hurricane preparedness.

Big Creek was the location in which the Peter Hughes dive boat &quot;Wave Dancer&quot; capsized during Hurricane Iris in October 2001, killing 20 persons, comprising 3 crew members and 17 vacationing divers from Richmond, Virginia.

<doc id="237788" wikidata="Q1099243" url="?curid=237788" title="Clayoquot Sound">
<text>Clayoquot Sound is located on the west coast of Vancouver Island in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is bordered by the Esowista Peninsula to the south, and the Hesquiaht Peninsula to the North. It is a body of water with many inlets and islands. Major inlets include Sydney Inlet, Shelter Inlet, Herbert Inlet, Bedwell Inlet, Lemmens Inlet, and Tofino Inlet. Major islands include Flores Island, Vargas Island, and Meares Island. The name is also used for the larger region of land around the waterbody (essentially its watershed).

==Origin of the name==
The name Clayoquot is derived from the name of a subgroup of the Nuu-chah-nulth, who lived at Clayoqua. In the late 20th century, this group merged into the multi-group band government known as the , meaning &quot;different&quot; or &quot;changing&quot; in their language.

==History==

First Nations have inhabited the area for thousands of years. The oldest dated location within Nuu-cha-nulth territory is 4,200 years (at Yuquot, Nootka Island). Because post-glacial sea-levels are known to have risen, overtaking earlier locations, most scholars will date the beginnings of human habitation beyond 9,000 years BP before present.

In the late 18th century, Clayoquot Sound and the Native American peoples were explored by ship by various Europeans and Americans who were involved mainly in the fur trade. In 1791, the complex inner waters were explored and mapped by José María Narváez and Juan Carrasco; their commander, Francisco de Eliza, met and befriended Wickaninnish, the chief of the peoples.

These explorers recognized the region&#x27;s wealth of natural resources. These resources attracted growing numbers of non-First Nations peoples, who limited First Nation access to land, and generated resentment among the locals. Government support of private company resource extraction allowed for the growth of such industry over time. Logging companies were active in harvesting timber in the Clayoquot Sound area as late as the 1980s and 1990s.

===Logging protests===

In the late 20th century, First Nations became more active in trying to defend their rights and resources. They developed Native lobbying organizations and insisted on negotiations regarding governmental policies about such resources. In the late 1980s, the situation escalated when the government approved MacMillan Bloedel Corporation&#x27;s permit to log Meares Island.

The First Nations peoples expressed their opposition to the MacMillan Bloedel Corporation logging in the Clayoquot Sound by several peaceful protests and blockades of logging roads from 1980 to 1994. In the summer of 1993, over 800 protestors were arrested, and many were tried for interfering with approved industry. Protestors included members of the local First Nation and Ahousaht First Nation bands, as well as New Democratic Party Minister of Parliament Svend Robinson, and environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of Clayoquot Sound.

International mass media covered the protests and blockades, helping to create national support for environmental movements in British Columbia and foster strong advocacy for anti-logging campaigns. Media reported the perceived injustice of numerous individuals being arrested for joining peaceful protests and blockades. In some cases, law enforcement responded aggressively, which eventually helped strengthen public support for non-violent protests.

After the 1990 protests, the provincial government made its first significant change in policy. It commissioned a scientific panel to examine issues related to Clayoquot Sound. In July 1995, the Forests Minister of British Columbia, Andrew Petter, and the Environment Minister, Elizabeth Cull, officially accepted the 127 panel recommendations, on behalf of the NDP government.

Members of Greenpeace were reported to play a significant role in these protests and instigated a boycott of BC forest products to apply pressure on the industry. After the government accepted the scientific panel&#x27;s recommendations, specifically deferring logging until an inventory of pristine areas was completed, Greenpeace lifted the boycott. After the inventory, the government reduced the Annual Allowable Cut, and clear-cuts in the area were limited to a maximum of four hectares. In addition, once biological and cultural inventories were completed, the government required Eco-Based Planning.

===Salmon farming and related controversy===
The sound&#x27;s ecological features have made it a major site for the farming of salmon, a fish traditional to this area. Floating feedlots have been installed, consisting of giant fenced pens. There are roughly twenty such farms in operation. A massive die-off of fish, possibly linked to an algal bloom caused by the intensive farming operation, occurred in 2019.

The densely packed farms have the disadvantage of providing conditions that allow for the rapid spread of disease. A highly contagious virus variant found in Norwegian salmon farms has been found in Clayoquot Sound farmed salmon. Environmental advocacy organizations have stated such events are evidence of the environmental damage associated with this type of fish farming. The British Columbia provincial government has closed other salmon farming sites on Vancouver Island. For instance, it is phasing out salmon farms by 2022 in the Discovery Islands on Vancouver Island&#x27;s east side.

==Indigenous peoples and governments==
The members of three major First Nations band governments of the peoples inhabit the Clayoquot Sound: the Hesquiaht in the North, the Ahousaht in the middle, and the in the south. The latter group is based in the village of Opitsaht on Meares Island. The village of Tofino lies opposite Opitsaht on the southern promontory of the entrance to the sound.

In 1985, for the first time in British Columbia history, the courts froze resource development on crown land because of a related Aboriginal title claim. Chiefs of the Ahousaht and first nations obtained an injunction halting logging on Meares Island in Clayoquot Sound pending treaty negotiations with the provincial government. These negotiations resulted in the provincial government and first nations signing the Interim Measures Act (IMA) on March 19, 1994. (This followed protests in 1993 that gained international coverage on this issue, increasing the pressure.) Since the IMA was signed, the First Nations and government have negotiated to co-manage local land and resources, including economic development strategies.

With the reduction in logging in this area, in the early 21st century, the communities surrounding Clayoquot Sound (Tofino, Ucluelet, and Ahousaht) have been developing new sources of income. They are emphasizing ecotourism and selective logging, based on co-management strategies.

==Ecology, parks and terrain==

The land around Clayoquot Sound includes vast coastal temperate rain forest, rivers, lakes, marine areas and beaches. It includes part of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve and some of Strathcona Provincial Park. The total size of the Clayoquot Sound region, including both land and water, is .

More than have been included as the subject of a multi-year study using Terrestrial Ecosystem Mapping (TEM) to identify areas prone to geologic and geomorphic hazards, in particular, landslides, soil erosion, and sedimentation. The study is also to identify and characterize terrain conditions associated with these hazards. The region contains the largest area of intact (unlogged) temperate rainforest left on Vancouver Island.

Clayoquot Sound is home to wolves, black bears, cougars, grey whales, orcas, porpoises, seals, sea lions, river otters, bald eagles, osprey, marbled murrelets, Pacific loons, Roosevelt elk, martens, and raccoons.

In 2000, Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve was designated as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. The designation created world recognition of Clayoquot Sound&#x27;s biological diversity, and a $12M monetary fund to &quot;support research, education and training in the Biosphere region&quot;.

At the end of July 2006, a new set of Watershed Plans was approved for Clayoquot Sound. This enabled logging in some of the forest, including pristine old-growth valleys. As of 2007, both logging tenures within Clayoquot Sound are controlled by aboriginal-owned logging companies Iisaak Forest Resources controls Timber Forest License (TFL) 57 in Clayoquot Sound, and MaMook Natural Resources Ltd, in conjunction with Coulson Forest Products, manages TFL54 in Clayoquot Sound.

<text>Les Misérables ( , ), colloquially known as Les Mis or Les Miz ( ), is a sung-through musical with music by Claude-Michel Schönberg, lyrics by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel, and a book by Schönberg and Boublil, based on the 1862 novel of the same name by Victor Hugo. Set in early 19th-century France, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; tells the story of Jean Valjean, a French peasant, and his desire for redemption. After stealing a loaf of bread for his sister&#x27;s starving child, Valjean is imprisoned for 19 years and released in 1815. When a bishop inspires him with a tremendous act of mercy, Valjean breaks his parole and starts his life anew and in disguise. He becomes wealthy and adopts an orphan, Cosette. A police inspector named Javert pursues Valjean over the decades in a single-minded quest for &quot;justice&quot;. The characters are swept into a revolutionary period in France, where a group of young idealists attempts to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris.

The French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein. Its English-language adaptation, with lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer, produced by Cameron Mackintosh, has been running in London since October 1985, making it the longest-running musical in the West End and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original off-Broadway run of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;. Many other long-running productions followed on Broadway and around the world, and a film adaptation was released in 2012.

==Background==
Alain Boublil&#x27;s initial idea to adapt Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel into a musical came while at a performance of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; in London: 

As soon as the Artful Dodger came onstage, Gavroche came to mind. It was like a blow to the solar plexus. I started seeing all the characters of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;—Valjean, Javert, Gavroche, Cosette, Marius, and Éponine—in my mind&#x27;s eye, laughing, crying, and singing onstage.

He shared the idea with French composer Claude-Michel Schönberg, and the two developed a rough synopsis and analysis of each character&#x27;s mental and emotional state, as well as that of an audience. Schönberg then began work on the music, while Boublil started writing the text. According to Boublil, &quot;I [began] work on the words ... after myself deciding on the subject and title of every song—in collaboration with my friend, poet Jean-Marc Natel.&quot; Two years later, a two-hour demo tape of Schönberg accompanying himself on the piano and singing every role was completed. An album of this collaboration was recorded at CTS Studios in Wembley and was released in 1980, selling 260,000 copies.

The &quot;Les Misérables&quot; concept album, starring Maurice Barrier as Jean Valjean, with Jacques Mercier as Javert, Rose Laurens as Fantine, Yvan Dautin and Marie-France Roussel as the Thénardiers, Richard Dewitte as Marius, Fabienne Guyon as Cosette, Marie-France Dufour as Éponine, Michel Sardou as Enjolras, Schönberg as Courfeyrac and Salvatore Adamo as Combeferre, was released in French in 1980, and the first stage adaptation was presented at the Palais des Sports in September of that year with many of the same cast, including Barrier, Laurens, Dautin, Roussel, and Guyon; Jean Vallée played Javert.

In 1983, about six months after producer Cameron Mackintosh had opened &quot;Cats&quot; on Broadway, he received a copy of the French concept album from director Peter Farago. Farago had asked Mackintosh to produce an English-language version of the show. Initially reluctant, Mackintosh eventually agreed. In conjunction with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), Mackintosh assembled a production team to adapt the French musical for a British audience. After two years in development, the English-language version, translated by Herbert Kretzmer (lyrics) and Siobhan Bracke (book), and expanded with additional material by James Fenton, opened in London in October 1985 at the Barbican Centre, then the London home of the RSC, before transferring to the West End.

==Initial reception; milestones==

Critical reviews for &quot;Les Misérables&quot; were initially negative. At the opening of the London production, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;″s Francis King described the musical as &quot;a lurid Victorian melodrama produced with Victorian lavishness&quot;, and Michael Ratcliffe of &quot;The Observer&quot; considered the show &quot;a witless and synthetic entertainment&quot;, while literary scholars condemned the project for converting classic literature into a musical. Public opinion differed: the box office received record orders. The three-month engagement sold out, and reviews improved. The London production has played over 15,000 performances, making it the second longest-running musical in the world after &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, the second longest-running West End show after &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, and the longest-running musical in the West End. On 3 October 2010, the show celebrated its 25th anniversary with three productions running in London: the original production at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre; the 25th Anniversary touring production at the Barbican Centre; and the 25th Anniversary concert at London&#x27;s O2 Arena.

The first Broadway production opened on 12 March 1987 and ran until 18 May 2003, closing after 6,680 performances. At the time of its closing, it was the second-longest-running musical in Broadway history. As of 2022, it remains the sixth longest-running Broadway show. The show was nominated for 12 Tony Awards, of which it won eight, including Best Musical and Best Original Score.

Subsequently, numerous tours and international and regional productions have been staged, as well as concert and broadcast productions. Several recordings have also been made. Broadway revivals played from 2006 to 2008 and 2014 to 2016. The show placed first in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of Britain&#x27;s &quot;Number One Essential Musicals&quot; in 2005, receiving more than forty percent of the votes. A film version directed by Tom Hooper was released at in 2012 to generally positive reviews; it won three Academy Awards and was nominated for five more, including Best Picture.

==Emblem==
The musical&#x27;s emblem is a picture of the waif Cosette sweeping the Thénardiers&#x27; inn (which occurs in the musical during &quot;Castle on a Cloud&quot;). It is usually cropped to a head-and-shoulders portrait, superimposed on the French flag. The image is based on an etching by Gustave Brion, which in turn was based on the drawing by Émile Bayard. Bayard&#x27;s drawing appeared in several of the novel&#x27;s earliest French-language editions.

==Synopsis==
===Prologue===
In 1815 France, a chain gang of prisoners labour (&quot;Prologue: Work Song&quot;). After 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread, Jean Valjean, &quot;Prisoner 24601&quot;, is released on parole by the prison guard Javert. Valjean must display a yellow ticket of leave, identifying him as an ex-convict (&quot;On Parole&quot;). He is shunned and cannot find decent work. Only the Bishop of Digne offers him food and shelter. Discontented, Valjean steals the Bishop&#x27;s silver. He is captured by the police; the Bishop pretends to have given Valjean the silver and passes him a pair of silver candlesticks as though he left them behind. The Bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver to become an honest man (&quot;Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven&quot;). Humbled by the Bishop&#x27;s kindness, Valjean resolves to redeem himself (&quot;Valjean&#x27;s Soliloquy (What Have I Done?)&quot;) and tears up his yellow ticket, breaking his parole.

===Act I===
In 1823, Valjean has assumed a new identity as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine, a single mother, works in his factory to support her daughter Cosette, who is being raised by the Thénardiers at their inn. The factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes it out on the other workers, who resent her for it. A coworker discovers and reveals to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and workers use the incident to manipulate Valjean into firing Fantine (&quot;At the End of the Day&quot;). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and Cosette&#x27;s father, who abandoned them both (&quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot;). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, becomes a prostitute (&quot;Lovely Ladies&quot;) and falls ill. When she fights back against an abusive customer, Javert, now a police inspector in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrests her. Valjean passes by and pities Fantine, realizing that she had worked for him. He orders her release and takes her to a hospital (&quot;Fantine&#x27;s Arrest&quot;).

Valjean soon rescues a man who is pinned by a runaway cart (&quot;The Runaway Cart&quot;). Javert, who has pursued the fugitive Valjean all these years, witnesses the incident. He becomes suspicious, remembering Valjean&#x27;s unusual strength at the work camp. However, a man who looks like Valjean has been arrested and is about to go to prison for breaking parole. Valjean confesses in court, unwilling to see an innocent man go to prison in his place (&quot;Who Am I? (The Trial)&quot;). In the hospital, Valjean promises Fantine he will find Cosette and protect her (&quot;Come to Me (Fantine&#x27;s Death)&quot;). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to rescue Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never reform. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes (&quot;The Confrontation&quot;). In Montfermeil, the duplicitous Thénardiers use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly, while extorting money from Fantine to indulge their own daughter Éponine. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly (&quot;Castle on a Cloud&quot;). The Thénardiers steal their customers&#x27; possessions and charge high prices for low-quality services while living a life of criminal depravity (&quot;Master of the House&quot;). Valjean offers the Thénardiers payment to adopt her (&quot;The Bargain&quot;). The Thénardiers negotiate, claiming they love Cosette like a daughter and that she is in fragile health. Valjean pays them 1,500 francs. He and Cosette leave for Paris (&quot;The Waltz of Treachery&quot;).
In 1832, Paris is in upheaval because of the impending death of General Lamarque, unique in showing mercy to the poor. Mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries Marius Pontmercy and Enjolras, who contemplate the effect Lamarque&#x27;s death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris. The Thénardiers have lost their inn and now run a street gang of thugs. The Thénardiers&#x27; daughter Éponine, now grown, has fallen in love with Marius, who sees her as a friend and is oblivious to her true feelings. She has befriended the young urchin Gavroche who knows everything that happens in the slums (&quot;Look Down&quot;). The Thénardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, Valjean and Cosette. While the gang confounds her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love. Thénardier recognizes Valjean, but Javert intervenes before they can finish the robbery (&quot;The Robbery&quot;). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow that he will find Valjean and recapture him (&quot;Stars&quot;). Marius persuades Éponine to help him find Cosette (&quot;Éponine&#x27;s Errand&quot;).

Enjolras exhorts a group of idealistic students to prepare for revolution. Marius fantasizes about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots (&quot;The ABC Café/Red and Black&quot;). Upon General Lamarque&#x27;s death, the students vow to use the public&#x27;s dismay to incite revolution (&quot;Do You Hear the People Sing?&quot;). At home, Cosette thinks about her meeting with Marius. She confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about their past (&quot;Rue Plumet/In My Life&quot;). Éponine leads Marius to Cosette&#x27;s garden. He and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love; Éponine is heartbroken (&quot;A Heart Full of Love&quot;). Thénardier and his gang arrive to rob Valjean&#x27;s house, but Éponine stops them by screaming a warning (&quot;The Attack on Rue Plumet&quot;). The scream alerts Valjean who, believing the intruder was Javert, prepares to flee France with Cosette. On the eve of the 1832 Paris Uprising, Cosette and Marius part in despair. Enjolras encourages all of Paris to join the revolution. Éponine acknowledges in anguish that Marius will never love her, and Marius is conflicted about whether to follow Cosette or join the uprising. Javert plans to spy on the students, as the Thénardiers scheme to profit from the coming violence. Marius decides to stand with his friends, and all anticipate the dawn (&quot;One Day More&quot;).

===Act II===

The students build a barricade to serve as their rally point. Javert, disguised as a rebel, volunteers to &quot;spy&quot; on the army troops. Marius discovers that Éponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels. Hoping to keep her safe from the violence, Marius sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette (&quot;Building the Barricade (Upon These Stones)&quot;). Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette&#x27;s romance. Éponine, alone on the streets of Paris, imagines Marius beside her and laments her unreciprocated love (&quot;On My Own&quot;).

The French army arrives at the barricade and demands the students surrender (&quot;At the Barricade&quot;). Javert tells the students that the government will not attack (&quot;Javert&#x27;s Arrival&quot;). Gavroche recognizes him and exposes him as a spy; the students detain him (&quot;Little People&quot;). The students&#x27; plan to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that the people of Paris will overwhelm the army. As Éponine returns, she is shot by the soldiers. As Marius holds her, she tells him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms (&quot;A Little Fall of Rain (Eponine&#x27;s Death)&quot;). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricade and resolve to fight in her name. Enjolras attempts to comfort the heartbroken Marius. Valjean arrives disguised as a soldier (&quot;Night of Anguish&quot;). He hopes that he can protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette&#x27;s sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first but accept him after he saves Enjolras from a soldier. Valjean asks Enjolras to allow him to execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees him. Javert warns Valjean he will not give up his pursuit. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release; he holds no grudges toward Javert for doing his duty (&quot;The First Attack&quot;).

The students express anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells them to stay awake for a surprise attack but tells the grieving Marius to sleep. Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies (&quot;Drink with Me&quot;). Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if his safety costs Valjean his own life (&quot;Bring Him Home&quot;). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realizes the people of Paris have not risen up with them but resolves to fight on against impossible odds (&quot;Dawn of Anguish&quot;). The students&#x27; resolve is strengthened when the army kills Gavroche (&quot;The Second Attack (Death of Gavroche)&quot;). The rebels fight to the last man; all are killed except Valjean, who carries a gravely wounded Marius into the sewers (&quot;The Final Battle&quot;). Javert arrives in search of Valjean and finds the open sewer grating. Valjean eventually collapses from exhaustion. Thénardier, who has been looting bodies, comes upon them and extracts a ring from the unconscious Marius. He flees as Valjean regains consciousness (&quot;Dog Eats Dog&quot;). At the sewer&#x27;s exit, Valjean finds Javert waiting. Valjean begs Javert for time to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert is unable to reconcile how this irredeemable criminal could perform such merciful acts. Torn between his beliefs about God and his loyalty to the law, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine (&quot;Javert&#x27;s Suicide&quot;).

After the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the students (&quot;Turning&quot;). The wounded Marius despairs at the deaths of his friends and feels their sacrifice was pointless (&quot;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables&quot;). He wonders who saved his life. Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their love. As Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once married, Valjean gives them his blessing (&quot;Every Day&quot;). He confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette (&quot;Valjean&#x27;s Confession&quot;). He makes Marius promise never to tell Cosette. Months later, Marius and Cosette marry (&quot;Wedding Chorale&quot;). The Thénardiers gatecrash the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him Valjean is a murderer and that Thénardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers. When Thénardier shows him the stolen ring as proof, Marius realizes Valjean saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean. The Thénardiers gloat that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again (&quot;Beggars at the Feast&quot;).

===Epilogue===
At a convent, Valjean awaits death, having nothing left to live for. Fantine&#x27;s spirit appears to tell him he is forgiven and will soon be with God. Cosette and Marius arrive. Near death, Valjean thanks God for letting him see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life (&quot;Valjean&#x27;s Death&quot;). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother. As he dies, the spirits of Fantine and Éponine guide him to Heaven reminding him that &quot;to love another person is to see the face of God&quot;. Joined by the spirits of those who died at the barricades, all anticipate a better world (&quot;Do You Hear the People Sing?&quot; (Reprise)).

==Productions==
===Sit-down productions===
====Original French production====

After the French concept album was released in 1980, in September of that year, a stage version directed by veteran French film director Robert Hossein was produced at the Palais des Sports in Paris. The show was a success, with 100 performances seen by over 500,000 people.

Most of the cast from the concept album performed in the production. The cast included Maurice Barrier as Valjean, Jean Vallée as Javert, Rose Laurens as Fantine, Maryse Cédolin and Sylvie Camacho and Priscilla Patron as Young Cosette, Marie-France Roussel as Mme. Thénardier, Yvan Dautin as M. Thénardier, Florence Davis and Fabrice Ploquin and Cyrille Dupont as Gavroche, Marianne Mille as Éponine, Gilles Buhlmann as Marius, Christian Ratellin as Enjolras, Fabienne Guyon as Cosette, René-Louis Baron as Combeferre, Dominique Tirmont as M. Gillenormand, Anne Forrez as Mlle. Gillenormand, and Claude Reva as the storyteller.

====Original London production====

The English-language version, with lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer and additional material by James Fenton, was substantially expanded and reworked from a literal translation by Siobhan Bracke of the original Paris version, in particular adding a prologue to tell Jean Valjean&#x27;s background story. Kretzmer&#x27;s lyrics are not a direct translation of the French, a term that Kretzmer refused to use. A third of the English lyrics were a rough translation, another third were adapted from the French lyrics and the final third consisted of new material. The majority is performed in recitative style; the vocalists use natural speech, not musical metrics.

The first production in English, produced by Cameron Mackintosh and adapted and directed by Trevor Nunn and John Caird, played in preview performances beginning on 28 September 1985 and formally opened on 8 October 1985 at the Barbican Centre, London. It was billed in the programme as &quot;The Royal Shakespeare Company presentation of the RSC/Cameron Mackintosh production&quot;. The set was designed by John Napier, costumes by Andreane Neofitou and lighting by David Hersey. Musical supervision and orchestrations were by John Cameron, who had been involved with the show since Boublil and Schönberg hired him to orchestrate the original French concept album. Musical staging was by Kate Flatt with musical direction by Martin Koch.

The original London cast included Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean, Roger Allam as Javert, Ken Caswell as the Bishop of Digne, Patti LuPone as Fantine, Zoë Hart, Justine McIntyre, Jayne O&#x27;Mahony and Joanne Woodcock as Young Cosette, Danielle Akers, Gillian Brander and Juliette Caton as Young Éponine, Susan Jane Tanner as Madame Thénardier, Alun Armstrong as Thénardier, Frances Ruffelle as Éponine, Rebecca Caine as Cosette, Michael Ball as Marius, David Burt as Enjolras, Clive Carter as Grantaire/Bamatabois, with Ian Tucker, Oliver Spencer and Liza Hayden sharing the role of Gavroche.

On 4 December 1985, the show transferred to the Palace Theatre, London and moved again on 3 April 2004, to the smaller Queen&#x27;s Theatre, now called the Sondheim Theatre, with some revisions of staging. The show celebrated its 10,000th performance on 5 January 2010, and its 30th anniversary in October 2015. The co-production has generated valuable income for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

The show closed temporarily at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre on 13 July 2019 to allow for theatre refurbishments, while a staged concert was performed at the adjacent Gielgud Theatre for a four-month run.

=====2019 updated staging=====
Using the updated staging developed for the 25th anniversary production at the Barbican, the musical began previews at the newly renamed Sondheim Theatre on 18 December 2019, with opening night on 16 January 2020. The production is co-directed by James Powell and Laurence Connor with set and image design by Matt Kinley, lighting by Paule Constable, sound by Mick Potter and costumes by Andreane Neofitou and Christine Rowlands. The first cast for this version included Jon Robyns (Valjean), Bradley Jaden (Javert), Carrie Hope Fletcher (Fantine), Shan Ako (Éponine), Lily Kerhoas (Cosette), Harry Apps (Marius), Gerard Carey (Thénardier), Josefina Gabrielle (Madame Thénardier) and Ashley Gilmour (Enjolras).

The show was forced to close temporarily from 16 March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It reopened on 25 September 2021. Considered one continuous production despite revisions, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; celebrated its 15,000th performance in London on 28 September 2023.

====Original Broadway production====
The musical opened as a pre-Broadway tryout at the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Opera House in Washington, D.C., on 27 December 1986. It ran for eight weeks through 14 February 1987.

The musical then premiered on Broadway on 12 March 1987 at The Broadway Theatre. Wilkinson and Ruffelle reprised their roles from the London production. The $4.5 million production had a more than $4 million advance sale prior to its New York opening.

The show underwent further tightening, namely with improved sewer lighting and the incorporation of the Javert suicide scene effect. A &quot;New York Times&quot; report consisted of the following: &quot;The transfer from London to the United States has prompted further modifications. &#x27;We are taking this opportunity to rethink and perfect, to rewrite some details which probably no one else will see, but which for us are still long nights of work,&#x27; Mr. Boublil says. &#x27;There are things that nobody had time to do in London, and here we have a wonderful opportunity to fix a few things. No one will notice, perhaps, but for us, it will make us so happy if we can better this show. We would like this to be the final version. Two songs were deleted—the complete version of Gavroche&#x27;s song &quot;Little People&quot; and the adult Cosette&#x27;s &quot;I Saw Him Once&quot;. A short section at the beginning of &quot;In My Life&quot; replaced &quot;I Saw Him Once&quot;. The lyrics in Javert&#x27;s &quot;Stars&quot; were changed. It now ended with the line, &quot;This I swear by the stars!&quot;, while the London production and cast recording ended with the repeated line, &quot;Keeping watch in the night&quot;.

The original Broadway cast included Wilkinson as Jean Valjean, David Bryant as Marius, Judy Kuhn as Cosette, Michael Maguire as Enjolras, Frances Ruffelle as Éponine, Braden Danner as Gavroche, Donna Vivino as Young Cosette, Jennifer Butt as Madame Thénardier, Leo Burmester as Thénardier, Randy Graff as Fantine, Terrence Mann as Javert, and Chrissie McDonald as Young Éponine.

Other members of the original Broadway cast included Anthony Crivello (Grantaire/Bamatabois), Kevin Marcum (Brujon), John Dewar (Joly), Paul Harman (Combeferre/Foreman), Joseph Kolinski (Feuilly), Alex Santoriello (Montparnasse/Labourer), Jesse Corti (Courfeyrac/Farmer), Susan Goodman (Old Woman/Innkeeper&#x27;s Wife), John Norman (Prouvaire/Pimp), Norman Large (Bishop/Lesgles), Marcus Lovett (Babet/Constable), Cindy Benson (Old Woman), Steve Shocket (Claquesous/Fauchevelant/Constable/Pimp), Marcie Shaw, Jane Bodle, Joanna Glushak, Ann Crumb (Factory Girl), Kelli James, and Gretchen Kingsley-Weihe. Michael Hinton was the original drummer and credited on the cast album.

The musical ran at the Broadway Theatre through 10 October 1990, when it moved to the Imperial Theatre. It was scheduled to close on 15 March 2003, but the closing was postponed by a surge in public interest. According to an article in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;Sales picked up last October, when Sir Cameron made the announcement that the show would be closing on March 15th... its closure postponed to May 18th because of an unexpected increase in business.&quot; After 6,680 performances in sixteen years, when it closed on 18 May 2003, it was the second-longest-running Broadway musical after &quot;Cats&quot;. It was surpassed by &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in 2006.

This Broadway production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and its advertising in New York City is a recurring theme in &quot;American Psycho&quot;. The reviewer for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Les Misérables&quot; is &quot;the book&#x27;s hilarious main cultural compass-point&quot;.

====Original Australia production====
A production opened in Australia at the Theatre Royal, Sydney on 27 November 1987. The cast featured Normie Rowe as Valjean, Philip Quast as Javert, Anthony Warlow as Enjolras, Debbie Byrne as Fantine, Simon Burke as Marius, Marina Prior as Cosette, Jodie Gillies as Eponine, Barry Langrish as Thénardier, and Robyn Arthur as Madame Thénardier. Rob Guest later took over the role of Valjean. The production closed on 17 August 1991.

====1989 Toronto production====
The first Canadian production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; began performances at the Royal Alexandra Theatre on 15 March 1989. The cast was headed by Michael Burgess as Jean Valjean, with Thomas Goerz as Javert and Louise Pitre as Fantine. After 14 months, the production toured other Canadian cities, including Vancouver, before returning to Toronto where it played another year, before finally closing on 5 July 1992.

====2006 Broadway revival====

Only three years after the original run closed, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; began a return to Broadway on 9 November 2006 at the Broadhurst Theatre for a limited run that was subsequently made open-ended.

Using the set, costumes, performers, and other resources from the recently finished third US national touring production, the production was only slightly altered. Minor changes included colourful projections blended into its existing lighting design, and a proscenium that extended out into the first two boxes on either side of the stage.

Some cuts made to the show&#x27;s prologue during its original Broadway run were restored, lyrics for Gavroche&#x27;s death scene (known in the revival as &quot;Ten Little Bullets&quot;) cut during the development of the original London production were restored, and much of the show was re-orchestrated by Christopher Jahnke, introducing a snare and timpani-heavy sound played by a 14-member band, a reduction of about 8 musicians from the original production&#x27;s 22 musician orchestration.

The original 2006 Broadway revival cast included Alexander Gemignani as Jean Valjean, Norm Lewis as Javert, Daphne Rubin-Vega as Fantine, Celia Keenan-Bolger as Éponine, Aaron Lazar as Enjolras, Adam Jacobs as Marius, Ali Ewoldt as Cosette, Gary Beach as Thénardier, Jenny Galloway as Madame Thénardier, Drew Sarich as Grantaire, Brian D&#x27;Addario, Jacob Levine, Skye Rainforth and Austyn Myers as Gavroche, and Tess Adams, Kylie Liya Goldstein and Carly Rose Sonenclar as Young Cosette/Young Éponine.

The revival closed on 6 January 2008 after 17 previews and 463 performances.

====2013 Toronto revival====
A production starring Canadian Ramin Karimloo was mounted at the Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto. Co-directed by Lawrence Connor and James Powell, the production was based on the 25th Anniversary touring production. Previews began on 27 September 2013 with the opening night on 9 October. Preparatory to a Broadway transfer, Toronto performances ended on 2 February 2014. In addition to Karimloo as Jean Valjean, Carpenter reprised the role of Javert. Other cast members included Genevieve Leclerc as Fantine, Samantha Hill as Cosette, Melissa O&#x27;Neil as Éponine, Perry Sherman as Marius, Cliff Saunders as Monsieur Thénardier, Lisa Horner as Madame Thénardier, and Mark Uhre as Enjolras. The roles of young Cosette and young Éponine were shared by Ella Ballentine, Saara Chaudry and Madison Oldroyd. Gavroche was shared by David Gregory Black and Aiden GlennRead. Colm Wilkinson, who originated the role of Jean Valjean, portrayed the Bishop of Digne in a one-day performance symbolically handing the torch (along with the candlesticks) to Karimloo.

====2014 Broadway revival====

The 2013 Toronto production moved to Broadway in March 2014 with previews beginning 1 March 2014 at the Imperial Theatre and an official opening on 23 March 2014. The creative team again was directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell, with set design by Matt Kinley, costumes by Andreane Neofitou and Christine Rowlands, lighting by Paule Constable, sound by Mick Potter and projections by Fifty-Nine Productions. Cameron Mackintosh once again produced the show. On 22 October 2013, it was announced that Ramin Karimloo, Will Swenson, Caissie Levy, and Nikki M. James would be headlining the revival cast as Jean Valjean, Javert, Fantine, and Éponine respectively. Andy Mientus and Samantha Hill also starred as Marius and Cosette respectively. Angeli Negron and McKayla Twiggs share the role of Young Cosette. The production closed on 4 September 2016, after 1,026 performances over two-and-a-half years. The revival recouped its entire initial investment and grossed $109 million.

The 2014 Broadway revival was nominated for 3 Tony Awards: Best Revival of a Musical, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Karimloo, and Best Sound Design for Potter.

===Touring productions===
====US national tours====
The show had three national touring companies of the original Broadway production in the US, all of which shared the Broadway producer and manager, creative teams, as well nearly identical sets, costumes, and lighting. While the touring production and the New York production were running simultaneously, the staff, cast members, crew, and musicians of the two productions interchanged often, which contributed to keeping both companies of the show in form. When the New York production closed in 2003, the Third National Tour continued for another three years, and enjoyed the influx of many members from the original and subsequent New York companies.

The First National Tour opened at Boston&#x27;s Shubert Theatre on 12 December 1987, and continued to play major cities until late 1991. The Second National Tour (called &quot;The Fantine Company&quot;) opened at Los Angeles&#x27; Shubert Theatre on 1 June 1988. The production played for fourteen months then transferred to San Francisco&#x27;s Curran Theatre where it enjoyed a similar run. The Third National Tour of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (called &quot;The Marius Company&quot;) was one of the longest running American touring musical productions. Opening on 28 November 1988, at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida, and closing on 23 July 2006, at the Fox Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri, the tour ran for seventeen years and 7,061 performances. The tour played in 145 cities in 43 states. The same touring company also frequently performed in Canada, made a 1994 diversion to Singapore, and another diversion in 2002 to be the first Western musical production to visit China, opening in Shanghai&#x27;s Grand Theatre for a three-week engagement.

All US productions (including Broadway and its revival) were visually identical in scale and design but the third national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5 million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set up and ready to go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.

A new national tour began on 21 September 2017 at the Providence Performing Arts Centre (PPAC). It starred Nick Cartell as Valjean, Josh Davis as Javert, Melissa Mitchell as Fantine, J. Anthony Crane as Thénardier, Allison Guinn as Madame Thénardier, Joshua Grosso as Marius, Phoenix Best as Éponine, Matt Shingledecker as Enjolras and Jillian Butler as Cosette. The roles of young Cosette and Éponine were shared by Zoe Glick and Sophie Knapp, while the role of Gavroche was shared by Jordan Cole and Julian Lerner. It uses much of the staging and technical work of the 2014 Broadway revival.&lt;ref name=&quot;US 2017/18 Tour Dates&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tour launched on 7 October 2022 at the State Theatre, Cleveland, with Nick Cartell as Jean Valjean, Preston Truman Boyd as Javert, Haley Dortch as Fantine, Matt Crowle as Thénardier, Christina Rose Hall as Madame Thénardier, Addie Morales as Cosette, Gregory Lee Rodriguez as Marius, Christine Heesun Hwang as Éponine, Devin Archer as Enjolras, and Randy Jeter as Bishop of Digne. This tour has grown to a North American tour.

==== UK and Ireland tours ====

The first tour of the UK and Ireland opened at the Palace Theatre, Manchester 14 April 1992 with Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), Philip Quast (Javert), Ria Jones (Fantine), Meredith Braun (Éponine), Mike Sterling (Marius), Tony Timberlake (Thénardier), Louise Plowright (Mdme Thénardier), Sarah Ryan (Cosette) and Daniel Coll (Enjolras).

==== 25th anniversary tour ====
A tour to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the show began performances on 12 December 2009, at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff. Differences from the original production included a new set, new costumes, new direction and alterations to the original orchestrations. The scenery was inspired by the paintings of Victor Hugo. Locations have included Manchester, Norwich, Birmingham, and Edinburgh. The tour also played a special engagement in Paris. From September through October, the show returned to the Barbican Centre, London, site of the original 1985 production. The tour cast featured John Owen-Jones as Valjean, Earl Carpenter as Javert, Gareth Gates as Marius, Ashley Artus as Thénardier, Lynne Wilmot as Madame Thénardier, Madalena Alberto as Fantine, Rosalind James as Éponine, Jon Robyns as Enjolras and Katie Hall as Cosette (with Samara Clarke as Young Cosette).

The tour ran until 11 August 2013, closing at the Smith Center for the Performing Arts in Las Vegas. The tour&#x27;s final cast included Peter Lockyer as Valjean, Andrew Varela as Javert, Genevieve Leclerc as Fantine, Lauren Wiley as Cosette, Devin Ilaw as Marius, Briana Carlson-Goodman as Éponine, Timothy Gulan as Thénardier, Shawna Hamic as Madame Thénardier, Jason Forbach as Enjolras, Ava Della Pietra and Erin Cearlock alternating as Little Cosette and Young Éponine, with Mia Sinclair Jenness as Little Girl, In 2011 it was reported that the tour is one of six US national Broadway tours that are grossing over $1,000,000 per week.

=====2018–2023 tour=====
A UK and Ireland tour similar to the 25th anniversary production began at the Curve, Leicester on 3 November 2018, starring Killian Donnelly (Jean Valjean), Nic Greenshields (Javert), Katie Hall (Fantine), Tegan Bannister (Éponine), Bronwen Hanson (Cosette), Harry Apps (Marius), Martin Ball (Thénardier), Sophie-Louise Dann (Madame Thénardier) and Will Richardson (Enjolras).

After a hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour resumed performances on 23 November 2021 at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow.

====2014–2016 Australian and international tour====
In mid-2013, a new Australian tour was announced, with Simon Gleeson as Valjean, Hayden Tee as Javert, Patrice Tipoki as Fantine, Trevor Ashley and Lara Mulcahy as the Thénardiers, Kerrie Anne Greenland as Éponine, Emily Langridge as Cosette, Euan Doidge as Marius and Chris Durling as Enjolras and Nicholas Cradock as Gavroche. The production opened on 4 July at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne. Additional stops for the Australian tour included the Crown Theatre in Perth, the Capitol Theatre in Sydney, and the Lyric Theatre QPAC in Brisbane. The Australian revival production transferred to Manila, Philippines in March 2016, becoming an international tour.

The Australian tour continued with an international tour beginning in Manila, Philippines, at the Theatre at Solaire from March 2016 until 1 May 2016, and proceeded to the Esplanade Theatre in Singapore from May 2016.

==Concert productions==

===10th Anniversary Concert===
On 8 October 1995, the show celebrated the tenth anniversary of the West End production with a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. This 10th Anniversary Concert was nearly &quot;complete&quot;, missing only a handful of scenes, including &quot;The Death of Gavroche&quot;, &quot;The Robbery&quot; and the confrontation between Marius and the Thénardiers at the wedding feast. Sir Cameron Mackintosh hand-selected the cast, which became known as the &quot;Les Misérables Dream Cast&quot;, assembled from around the world, and engaged the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The concert concluded with seventeen Valjeans from various international productions singing, &quot;Do You Hear the People Sing?&quot; in their native languages. The concert cast included Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean, Philip Quast as Javert, Paul Monaghan as the Bishop of Digne, Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, Hannah Chick as Young Cosette, Jenny Galloway as Madame Thénardier, Alun Armstrong as Thénardier, Adam Searles as Gavroche, Michael Maguire as Enjolras, Michael Ball as Marius, Judy Kuhn as Cosette, Lea Salonga as Éponine, and Anthony Crivello as Grantaire.

=== The All-Star Staged Concert ===
From 10 August to 2 December 2019, the musical was performed as a staged concert version at the Gielgud Theatre in the West End during the refurbishment of the adjacent Sondheim Theatre, where the original London production had been running and would be home to the production from December 2019 onwards.

Featuring a cast and orchestra of over 65, the 16-week concert run starred Michael Ball as Javert, Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, Carrie Hope Fletcher as Fantine, Matt Lucas and Katy Secombe as the Thénardiers, and John Owen-Jones played Jean Valjean for some performances. Further leads included Rob Houchen (Marius), Bradley Jaden (Enjolras), Shan Ako (Éponine), and Lily Kerhoas (Cosette). Also featured was Earl Carpenter playing Bamatabois. Simon Bowman played the Bishop of Digne for eight days after which Carpenter took over the role alongside his other two parts.

The final concert was filmed and broadcast live to cinemas on 2 December and has since been released on home video and album, with a tour planned.

In October 2020, on the final of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, it was confirmed that the stage concert would return for a limited six-week run at the Sondheim Theatre from 5 December 2020 to 17 January 2021. It was subsequently extended twice and was due to play until 28 February 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the audience were socially distanced and capacity was limited to 50%. Due to local COVID restrictions, the show was suspended from 16 December 2020 after just 10 performances, in which Boe had performed as Jean Valjean on eight occasions and Owen-Jones on two occasions. It reopened on 20 May 2021 and ran until 5 September with Jon Robyns as Valjean, Jaden as Javert, Lucie Jones as Fantine, Gerard Carey and Josefina Gabrielle as the Thénardiers, Shan Ako as Éponine, Harry Apps as Marius, Jamie Muscato as Enjolras, Charlie Burn as Cosette, Carpenter as the Bishop of Digne, Cameron Blakely as Bamatabois/Babet, and at certain performances Dean Chisnall as Valjean.

=== The Arena Spectacular World Tour ===
A concert production began a world tour on 19 September 2024, starting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The tour is expected to visit more than 15 countries and to include guest performers at some stops. Alfie Boe and Killian Donnelly share the role of Valjean, and Michael Ball and Bradley Jaden share the role of Javert. Peter Jöback reprised the role of Valjean at the Sweden performances. Also in the cast are Channah Hewitt and Katie Hall as Fantine, Gavin Lee and Matt Lucas as Thénardier, Bonnie Langford and Linzi Hateley as Madame Thénardier, Jac Yarrow as Marius, Beatrice Penny-Touré as Cosette, James D. Gish as Enjolras, Connor Jones and Raymond Walsh as Grantaire, Jeremy Secomb and Tommy Körberg as the Bishop of Digne, and Emily Bautista, Nathania Ong and Aviva Tulley as Éponine. Reviews of the production have been favourable.

==International productions==
The show has been produced in at least 42 countries and translated into at least 21 languages: English, French (re-translated from the English version), German (Austria and Germany), Spanish (six versions: two from Spain, two from Mexico, one from Argentina, and one from Venezuela), Japanese, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Norwegian (Bokmål and Nynorsk), Polish, Swedish (in Sweden and in Finland), Dutch (Netherlands and Belgium), Danish, Finnish, Brazilian Portuguese, Estonian, Czech, Mauritian Creole, Basque, Catalan and Korean. Including singles and promos, there have been over seventy official recordings from worldwide productions.

The first full production in the European mainland was in Oslo, Norway at Det Norske Teatret and opened on 17 March 1988. The production was in Norwegian and starred singer/actor Øystein Wiik as Jean Valjean, Paul Åge Johannessen as Javert, Øivind Blunck as Thénardier, Kari Gjærum as Fantine, Amund Enger as Enjolras and Guri Schanke as Éponine. The production was a box office hit, with approximately 10% of Norway&#x27;s entire population seeing the show in the first 6 months. Øystein Wiik went on to star as Jean Valjean in productions in Vienna and London in 1989–1990.

The stage show, which had changed so significantly since its Parisian conception as a stadium concert in 1980, was translated back into the language of Victor Hugo for its French world première in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1991. Five shows a week were in French, and three per week were in English.

In 1998, a concert version in English was produced in Malta, at the Mediterranean Conference Centre, Valletta. This production was staged by a company called Act React and featured Ray Mangion as Jean Valjean, Roger Tirazona as Javert, Julie James as Fantine, Leila Benn Harris as Éponine, Claire Debono as Cosette, Fabrizio Faniello as Marius, Lawrence Gray as Enjolras, Rennie Vella as Thenardier, Doreen Galea as Madame Thenardier, Dean Zammit as Gavroche and Hannah Schembri as Little Cosette.

===North American productions===
In September 2008, a mini-tour produced by Atlanta&#x27;s Theater of the Stars played Eisenhower Hall at the United States Military Academy, in West Point, New York; the Filene Center at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna, Virginia; Kansas City Starlight Theatre; and the Fox Theater in Atlanta. The set featured original pictures painted by Victor Hugo. Robert Evan reprised the role of Valjean. Also featured were Nikki Renee Daniels as Fantine and Robert Hunt as Javert, both reprising their roles from the Broadway revival. Fred Hanson directed the production. The creative team included Matt Kinley as Scenic Designer, Ken Billington as Lighting Designer, Peter Fitzgerald and Erich Bechtel as Sound Designers, Zachary Borovay as Projection Designer, and Dan Riddle as musical director and Conductor.

In 2008, the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia staged a small venue &quot;black box&quot; version of the play. Signature received Mackintosh&#x27;s special permission for the production: &quot;One of the great pleasures of being involved with the creation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; is seeing this marvelous musical being done in a completely different and original way.&quot; The production officially opened on 14 December 2008 (after previews from 2 December), and ran through 22 February 2009.

A 2014 production at the Dallas Theater Center modernized the staging with a setting in the modern-day United States. The concept was thought to be a refreshing stylistic change and effective as a commentary on modern inequality. The unauthorized depart from the authors&#x27; libretto and score, however, was controversial.

In Panama, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; was staged in 2014 in Spanish at the National Theatre of Panama for a short, sold-out run, directed by Aaron Zebede.

=== School edition ===
The school edition cuts a considerable amount of material from the original show. It is divided into thirty scenes and, although no critical scenes or songs have been removed, it runs 25–30 minutes shorter than the official version making the total running time about 2.5 hours. &quot;What Have I Done?&quot;, &quot;Valjean&#x27;s Soliloquy&quot;, &quot;Stars&quot;, &quot;A Little Fall of Rain&quot;, &quot;Turning&quot;, and &quot;Castle on a Cloud&quot; lose a verse each. During &quot;Fantine&#x27;s Arrest&quot;, Bamatabois loses two verses. The song &quot;Fantine&#x27;s Death/Confrontation&quot; is edited, and the counterpoint duel between Javert and Valjean is cut, as well as a verse by Fantine. &quot;Dog Eats Dog&quot; by Thénardier is truncated. &quot;Beggars at the Feast&quot;, is shortened, with Thénardier losing a verse, and the song before it, &quot;Wedding Chorale&quot;, is removed entirely, although the rest of the wedding remains in place. Also, the drinker&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Master of the House&quot; is cut.

==Film adaptation==
==Cast recordings==
===English===
The following recordings of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; are available in English: the Original London Cast, the Original Broadway Cast, the Complete Symphonic Recording, the 10th Anniversary London Concert, The 25th Anniversary UK Tour Cast and The 25th Anniversary London Concert.

====Original London Cast recording====
The Original London Cast recording was the first English language album of the musical. Recorded in 1985, when the show premiered, it is closest to the original French concept album. For example, &quot;Stars&quot; appears before &quot;Look Down&quot; and shortly after, the original version of &quot;Little People&quot; plays, which was later incorporated into the revealing of Javert. It also features a song titled &quot;I Saw Him Once&quot;, sung by Cosette, which was later incorporated into the first part of &quot;In My Life&quot;. The album has sold 887,000 copies in the US .

====Original Broadway Cast recording====
The Original Broadway Cast recording was produced in 1987. It included several changes to the songs that are still evident in today&#x27;s performances. As with its predecessor, it is incomplete, and leaves out songs or parts that are more important narratively than musically (e.g., &quot;Fantine&#x27;s Arrest&quot;, &quot;The Runaway Cart&quot;, &quot;The Final Battle&quot;). The album has sold 1,596,000 copies in the US .

====Complete Symphonic Recording====
Recorded in 1988 and released in 1989, the Complete Symphonic Recording features the entire score. (The Czech Revival Recording is the only other album, in any language, to feature the entire score; on the other hand, the four 2003 Japanese recordings feature the entire score after the cuts first made on Broadway at the end of 2000.) Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s original plan was to use the Australian cast, but the scope was expanded to create an international cast featuring performers from the major performances of the musical. The cast was recorded in three different places.

The album, produced by David Caddick and conducted by Martin Koch, won the Best Musical Cast Show Album Grammy Award in 1990. The cast includes Gary Morris as Valjean, Philip Quast as Javert, Debra Byrne as Fantine, Gay Soper as Madame Thénardier, Barry James as Monsieur Thénardier, Kaho Shimada as Éponine, Ross McCall as Gavroche, Michael Ball as Marius, Anthony Warlow as Enjolras, Martin Smith as Bamatabois, Tracy Shayne as Cosette, Ken Caswell as the Bishop of Digne, Kenny D&#x27;Aquila as Grantaire, and Marissa Dunlop as Young Cosette.

====10th Anniversary Concert====

The 10th Anniversary recording was of a concert version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, performed at the Royal Albert Hall in October 1995, featuring full orchestra and choir. All parts were sung live, giving the performance a different mood from other recordings. The score was recorded consecutively without pauses or multiple recordings. The concert&#x27;s encores are also included. As with the original recordings, however, they differed from the stage versions by excluding some songs (e.g., those vital to plot such as &quot;Fantine&#x27;s Arrest&quot; and &quot;The Runaway Cart&quot; were kept, while unnecessary or complex songs, such as &quot;At the Barricade&quot;, were left out).

====25th Anniversary UK Tour Cast====
Recorded live at the Palace Theatre in Manchester, this recording was released to commemorate 25 years of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and features new arrangements and reinspired orchestrations.

====25th Anniversary Concert====
The 25th Anniversary Concert was recorded live at The O2 Arena on 3 October 2010 and is available on DVD in the UK while the Blu-ray was released worldwide. It was shown in select US theaters via NCM Fathom Events. The release for the DVD and Blu-ray in the United States was 22 February 2011 to promote the film adaptation.

<text>The black stork (Ciconia nigra) is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Measuring on average from beak tip to end of tail with a wingspan, the adult black stork has mainly black plumage, with white underparts, long red legs and a long pointed red beak. A widespread but uncommon species, it breeds in scattered locations across Europe (predominantly in Portugal and Spain, and central and eastern parts), and east across the Palearctic to the Pacific Ocean. It is a long-distance migrant, with European populations wintering in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian populations in the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing broad expanses of the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east, the Strait of Sicily in the center, or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west. An isolated non-migratory population lives in Southern Africa.

Unlike the closely related white stork, the black stork is a shy and wary species. It is seen singly or in pairs, usually in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. It feeds on amphibians, small fish and insects, generally wading slowly in shallow water stalking its prey. Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees—most commonly deciduous but also coniferous—which can be seen from long distances, as well as on large boulders, or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas. The female lays two to five greyish-white eggs, which become soiled over time in the nest. Incubation takes 32 to 38 days, with both sexes sharing duties, and fledging takes 60 to 71 days.

The black stork is considered to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but its actual status is uncertain. Despite its large range, it is nowhere abundant, and it appears to be declining in parts of its range, such as in India, China and parts of Western Europe, though increasing in others such as the Iberian Peninsula. Various conservation measures have been taken for the black stork, like the Conservation Action Plan for African black storks by Wetlands International. It is also protected under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. On 31 May 1968, South Korea designated the species as natural monument 200.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
English naturalist Francis Willughby wrote about the black stork in the 17th century, having seen one in Frankfurt. He named it &quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;, from the Latin words for &quot;stork&quot; and &quot;black&quot; respectively. It was one of the many species originally described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name of &quot;Ardea nigra&quot;. It was moved to the new genus &quot;Ciconia&quot; by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson two years later. The word &quot;stork&quot; is derived from the Old English word &quot;storc&quot;, thought to be related to the Old High German &quot;storah&quot;, meaning &quot;stork&quot;, and the Old English &quot;stearc&quot;, meaning &quot;stiff&quot;.

The black stork is a member of the genus &quot;Ciconia&quot;, or typical storks, a group of seven extant species, characterised by straight bills and mainly black and white plumage. The black stork was long thought to be most closely related to the white stork (&quot;C. ciconia&quot;). However, genetic analysis via DNA–DNA hybridization and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 found that it was basal (an early offshoot) in the genus &quot;Ciconia&quot;. Fossil remains have been recovered from Miocene beds on Rusinga and Maboko Islands in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black storks.

==Description==

The black stork is a large bird, measuring between in length with a wingspan, and weighing around . Standing as tall as , it has long red legs, a long neck and a long, straight, pointed red beak. It bears some resemblance to Abdim&#x27;s stork (&quot;C. abdimii&quot;), which can be distinguished by its much smaller build, predominantly green bill, legs and feet, and white rump and lower back. The plumage is black with a purplish green sheen, except for the white lower breast, belly, armpits, axillaries and undertail coverts. The breast feathers are long and shaggy, forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The black stork has brown irises, and bare red skin around its eyes. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. Moulting takes place in spring, with the iridescent sheen brighter in new plumage. It walks slowly and steadily on the ground and like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched.

The juvenile resembles the adult in plumage, but the areas corresponding to the adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly be confused with the juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.

==Distribution and habitat==

During the summer, the black stork is found from Eastern Asia (Siberia and northern China) west to Central Europe, reaching Estonia in the north, Poland, Lower Saxony and Bavaria in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Greece in the south, with an outlying population in the central-southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula (Extremadura and surrounding provinces of Spain, plus Portugal). It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and Asia, although certain populations of black storks are sedentary or dispersive. An isolated population exists in Southern Africa, where the species is more numerous in the east, in eastern South Africa and Mozambique, and is also found in Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Botswana and less commonly Namibia.

Most of the black storks that summer in Europe migrate to Africa, with those from western Germany and points west heading south via the Iberian Peninsula and the rest via Turkey and the Levant. Those flying via Spain spend winter in the Falémé River basin of eastern Senegal, Guinea, southern Mauritania, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and western and central Mali, while those flying via the Sinai end up in northern Ethiopia, the Kotto River basin in the Central African Republic, the Mbokou river basin in Chad and northeastern Nigeria. Black storks summering in West Asia migrate to northern and northeastern India, ranging mainly from Punjab south to Karnataka, and Africa. They are occasional visitors to Sri Lanka. Those summering further east in eastern Russia and China winter mainly in southern China, and occasionally in Hong Kong, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and Laos. They were first recorded in western Myanmar in 1998.

The black stork prefers more wooded areas than the better-known white stork, and breeds in large marshy wetlands with interspersed coniferous or broadleaved woodlands, but also inhabits hills and mountains with sufficient networks of creeks. It usually inhabits ponds, rivers, edges of lakes, estuaries and other freshwater wetlands. The black stork does inhabit more agricultural areas in the Caspian lowlands, but even here it avoids close contact with people. Its wintering habitat in India comprises reservoirs or rivers with nearby scrub or forest, which provide trees that black storks can roost in at night. In southern Africa it is found in shallow water in rivers or lakes, or swamps, but is occasionally encountered on dry land.

After disappearing from Belgium before the onset of the 20th century, it has returned to breed in the Belgian Ardennes, Luxembourg and Burgundy, France, by 2000. It appears to be increasing in numbers in Spain and Portugal, where the population was estimated at 405 to 483 pairs in 2006. The black stork is a rare vagrant to the British Isles, turning up in the warmer months—particularly in spring—generally in the south and east. Sightings have become more common since the 1970s as its breeding range moves northwards. It has been recorded in Scotland six times between 1946 and 1983, including from Shetland, Orkney and the Highlands, as well as the Scottish Borders (Peebles). It is not abundant in the western parts of its distribution, but more densely inhabits eastern Transcaucasia. Further east, it has been recorded from locations across Iran, though little is known about its habits there; breeding has been recorded from near Aliabad in Fars province, Khabr National Park in Kerman province, Karun river in Khuzestan province, Qaranqu River in East Azarbaijan province, and Aliabad river in Razavi Khorasan province. The population has declined in Iran due to draining of wetlands. East of the Ural Mountains, the black stork is patchily found in forested and mountainous areas up to 60°‒63° N across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. South of Siberia, it breeds in Xinjiang, northwestern China, northern Mongolia south to the Altai Mountains, and northeastern China south to the vicinity of Beijing. In the Korean peninsula, the black stork is an uncommon summer visitor, no longer breeding in the south since 1966. Birds have been seen in the northeast but it is not known whether they breed there. Similarly it has been seen in the summer in Afghanistan, but its breeding status is uncertain.

===Migration===

Migration takes place from early August to October, with a major exodus in September. Some of the Iberian populations, and also those in southern Africa, are essentially non-migratory, though they may wander freely in the non-breeding areas. A broad-winged soaring bird, the black stork is assisted by thermals of hot air for long-distance flight, although is less dependent on them than is the white stork. Since thermals only form over land, the black stork, together with large raptors, must cross the Mediterranean at the narrowest points, and many black storks travel south through the Bosphorus and on through the Sinai, as well as through Gibraltar. The trip is around via the western route and via the eastern route, with satellite tracking yielding an average travel time of 37 and 80 days respectively. The western route goes over the Rock of Gibraltar or over the Bay of Gibraltar, generally on a southwesterly track that takes them to the central part of the strait, from where they reach Morocco. Many birds then fly around the Sahara next to the coast. About 10% of the western storks choose the passage between Sicily (Italy) and Cap Bon (Tunisia), crossing the 145 km wide Strait of Sicily.

Spain contains several important areas—Monfragüe National Park, Sierra de Gredos Regional Park, National Hunting Reserve in Cíjara, Natural Park of the Sierra Hornachuelos and Doñana National Park—where black storks stop over on the western migration route. Pesticide use has threatened birdlife in nearby Doñana. Further south, Lake Faguibine in Mali is another stopover point but it has been affected by drought in recent years.

== Behaviour ==
A wary species, the black stork avoids contact with people. It is generally found alone or in pairs, or in flocks of up to 100 birds when migrating or during winter.

The black stork has a wider range of calls than the white stork, its main call being a &quot;chee leee&quot;, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like squealing calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.

The &quot;up-down display&quot; is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. Here a stork positions its body horizontally and quickly bobs its head up from down-facing to around 30 degrees above horizontal and back again, while displaying the white segments of its plumage prominently, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, and—more vigorously—as a threat display. The species&#x27; solitary nature means that this threat display is rarely witnessed.

===Breeding===


The black stork breeds between April and May in the Northern Hemisphere, with eggs usually laid in late April. In southern Africa, breeding takes place in the months between September and March, possibly to take advantage of abundant water prey rendered easier to catch as the rivers dry up and recede—from April and May in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern South Africa, and as late as July further south.

Pairs in courtship have aerial displays that appear to be unique among the storks. Paired birds soared in parallel, usually over the nest territory early in the mornings or late afternoons with one bird splaying the white undertail coverts to the sides of the narrowed black tail and the pair calls to each other. These courtship flights are difficult to see due to the densely forested habitat in which they breed. The nest is large, constructed from sticks and twigs, and sometimes also large branches, at an elevation of . The black stork prefers to construct its nest in forest trees with large canopies where the nest can be built far from the main trunk—generally in places far from human disturbance. For the most part, deciduous trees are chosen for nesting sites, though conifers are used as well. A 2003 field study in Estonia found that the black stork preferred oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), European aspen (&quot;Populus tremula&quot;), and to a lesser extent Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;), and ignored Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;), in part due to the canopy structure of the trees. Trees with nests averaged around high and had a diameter at breast height of . Furthermore, 90% of the trees chosen were at least 80 years old, highlighting the importance of conserving old-growth forests. A 2004 field study of nesting sites in Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli National Park in north-eastern Greece found that it preferred the Calabrian pine (&quot;Pinus brutia&quot;), which had large side branches that allowed it to build the nest away from the trunk, as well as black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;) and to a lesser extent Turkey oak (&quot;Quercus cerris&quot;). It chose the largest trees in an area, generally on steeper ground and near streams. Trees chosen were on average over 90 years old. In the Iberian peninsula it nests in pine and cork oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;).

In steeply mountainous areas such as parts of Spain, South Africa and the Carpathian Mountains it nests on cliffs, on large boulders, in caves and under overhanging ledges. The black stork&#x27;s solitary nests are usually at least 1 km (0.6 mi) apart, even where the species is numerous. Although newly constructed nests may be significantly smaller, older nests can be in diameter. In southern Africa, the black stork may occupy the nests of other bird species such as hamerkop (&quot;Scopus umbretta&quot;) or Verreaux&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila verreauxi&quot;) and commonly reuses them in successive years. They are repaired with earth and grass, and lined with leaves, moss, grass, animal fur, paper, clay and rags. In a clutch, there are two to five, or rarely even six large oval grey-white eggs, which become soiled during incubation. They can be long and wide, averaging about in length and in width. The eggs are laid with an interval of two days. Hatching is asynchronous, and takes place at the end of May. Incubation takes 32 to 38 days, with both sexes sharing duties, which commence after the first or second egg is laid. The young start flying by the end of July. Fledging takes 60 to 71 days, after which the young joins the adults at their feeding grounds. However, for another two weeks, the young continue to return to the nest, to be fed and to roost at night.

At least one adult remains in the nest for two to three weeks after hatching to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents&#x27; method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.

Ringing recovery studies in Europe suggests that nearly 20% of chicks reach the breeding stage, around 3 years, and about 10% live beyond 10 years and about 5% beyond 20 years. Captive individuals have lived for as long as 36 years.

The black stork mainly eats fish, including small cyprinids, pikes, roaches, eels, budds, perches, burbots, sticklebacks and muddy loaches (&quot;Misgurnus&quot; and &quot;Cobitis&quot;). It may feed on amphibians, small reptiles, crabs, mammals and birds, and invertebrates such as snails, molluscs, earthworms, and insects like water beetles and their larvae.

Foraging for food takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food on dry land at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been observed shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (&quot;Ciconia episcopus&quot;), demoiselle crane (&quot;Grus virgo&quot;) and bar-headed goose (&quot;Anser indicus&quot;). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.

===Parasites and symbionts===
More than 12 species of parasitic helminth have been recorded from black storks with &quot;Cathaemasia hians&quot; and &quot;Dicheilonema ciconiae&quot; reported to be the most dominant. The juvenile black stork, although having a less diverse helminth population, is parasitized more frequently than the adult. A species of &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;—&quot;C. ciconiae&quot;—was isolated and described from the trachea of healthy black storks, and is thought to be part of the natural flora of the species. A herpes virus is known from black storks. Birdlice that have been recorded on the species include &quot;Neophilopterus tricolor, Colpocephalum nigrae,&quot; and &quot;Ardeicola maculatus.&quot; A diverse array of predatory mesostigmatid mites—particularly the genera &quot;Dendrolaelaps&quot; and &quot;Macrocheles&quot;—have been recovered from black stork nests. Their role is unknown, though they could prey on parasitic arthropods.

== Status and conservation ==
Since 1998, the black stork has been rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it has a large range—more than 20,000 km2 (7,700 mi2)—and because its population is thought not to have declined by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not a rapid enough decline to warrant a vulnerable rating. Even so, the state of the population overall is unclear, and although it is widespread, it is not abundant anywhere. Black stork numbers have declined for many years in western Europe, and the species has been extirpated as a breeding bird from the northwestern edge of its range, including the Netherlands and Scandinavia (for example, small numbers used to breed in Denmark and Sweden, but none verified after the 1950s). The population in India—a major wintering ground—is declining. Previously a regular winter visitor to the Mai Po Marshes, it is now seldom seen there, and appears to be in decline in China overall. Its habitat is changing rapidly in much of eastern Europe and Asia. Various conservation measures have been taken, including Wetlands International&#x27;s Conservation Action Plan for African black storks, which focuses on improving the wintering conditions of the birds which breed in Europe. It is protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

Hunters threaten the black stork in some countries of southern Europe and Asia, such as Pakistan, and breeding populations may have been eliminated there. The black stork vanished from the Ticino River valley in northern Italy, with hunting a likely contributor. In 2005, black storks were released into the Parco Lombardo del Ticino in an attempt to re-establish the species there.

Since October 2021, the black stork has been classified as Moderately Depleted by the IUCN Green Status of Species.

<text>Chaturanga (, , ) is an ancient Indian strategy board game. It is first known from India around the seventh century AD. 

While there is some uncertainty, the prevailing view among chess historians is that chaturanga is the common ancestor of the board games chess, xiangqi (Chinese), janggi (Korean), shogi (Japanese), sittuyin (Burmese), makruk (Thai), ouk chatrang (Cambodian) and modern Indian chess. It was adopted as &quot;chatrang&quot; (&quot;shatranj&quot;) in Sassanid Persia, which in turn was the form of chess brought to late-medieval Europe.

Not all the rules of chaturanga are known with certainty. Chess historians suppose that the game had similar rules to those of its successor, shatranj. In particular, there is uncertainty as to the moves of the gaja (elephant).

==Etymology==
Sanskrit &quot;&quot; is a bahuvrihi compound word, meaning &quot;having four limbs or parts&quot; and in epic poetry often meaning &quot;army&quot;. The name comes from a battle formation mentioned in the Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Chaturanga refers to four divisions of an army, namely elephantry, chariotry, cavalry and infantry. An ancient battle formation, &quot;akshauhini&quot;, is like the setup of chaturanga.

==History==
===Origin===
The origin of chaturanga has been a puzzle for centuries. The earliest clear reference comes from north India from the Gupta Empire, dating from the sixth century AD. Banabhatta&#x27;s &quot;Harsha Charitha&quot; (c. AD 625) contains the earliest reference to the name chaturanga: 
Under this monarch [...], only the bees quarrelled to collect the dew; the only feet cut off were those of measurements, and only from Ashtâpada one could learn how to draw up a chaturanga, there was no cutting-off of the four limbs of condemned criminals...

According to Stewart Culin, chaturanga was first described in the Hindu text &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot;. The &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot; is known to include modern additions and interpolations, however, even mentioning British rule of India.

An early reference to an ancient Indian board game is sometimes attributed to Subandhu in his &quot;Vasavadatta&quot;, dated between the 5th and 7th centuries AD: The time of the rains played its game with frogs for pieces [&quot;nayadyutair&quot;] yellow and green in colour, as if mottled by lac, leapt up on the black field squares.

The colours are not those of the two camps, but mean that the frogs have two colours, yellow and green.

Chaturanga may also have much older roots, dating back 5,000 years. Archeological remains from 2000 to 3000 BC have been found from the city of Lothal (of the Indus Valley Civilisation) of pieces on a board that resemble chess. Another argument that chaturanga is much older is the fact that the chariot is the most powerful piece on the board, although chariots appear to have been obsolete in warfare for at least five or six centuries, superseded by light and heavy cavalries. The counterargument is that they remained prominent in literature and continued to be used for travel and transport, in processions, for games, and in races.

===Spread outside India===
While there is some uncertainty, the prevailing view among chess historians is that chaturanga is the common ancestor of the board games chess, xiangqi (Chinese), janggi (Korean), shogi (Japanese), sittuyin (Burmese), makruk (Thai), ouk chatrang (Cambodian) and modern Indian chess.

In Arabic, most of the terminology of chess is derived directly from chaturanga: Modern chess itself is called shatranj in Arabic, and the bishop is called the elephant. The Tamerlane chess was also introduced in Iran later.

The game was first introduced to the West in Thomas Hyde&#x27;s &quot;De ludis orientalibus libri duo&quot;, published in 1694. Subsequently, translations of Sanskrit accounts of the game were published by Sir William Jones.

==The game==

===Set-up===
Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board, called &quot;ashtāpada&quot;, which is also the name of a game. The board sometimes had special markings, the meaning of which are unknown today. These marks were not related to chaturanga, but were drawn on the board only by tradition. These special markings coincide with squares unreachable by any of the four gajas that start on the board due to movement rules. Chess historian H. J. R. Murray conjectured that the ashtāpada was also used for some old race-type dice game, perhaps similar to chowka bhara, in which the marks had meaning.
===Rules===
The initial position is as shown. White moves first. The objective in chaturanga is to checkmate the opponent&#x27;s raja (king) or reducing the opposition to just the raja.


===Pieces and their moves===

* Raja (king): moves one step in any direction (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), the same as the king in chess. There is no castling in chaturanga.
** The general in Chinese xiangqi lacks diagonals, which might be the earliest move of the raja. The minority view that chaturanga developed from a form of xiangqi implies such an evolution, but it is also logical to assume such a move as the case for an Indian proto-chaturanga.
* Mantri (minister); also known as senapati (general): moves one step diagonally in any direction, like the fers in shatranj.
* Ratha (chariot) (also known as sakaṭa) moves the same as a rook in chess: horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares.
* Gaja (elephant) (also known as hasti). Three different moves are described in ancient literature:
*# Two squares in any diagonal direction, jumping over the first square, as the alfil in Iranian shatranj, Ethiopian senterej, Mongolian Tamerlane chess and medieval courier chess. This is a fairy chess piece that is a (2,2)-leaper. 
*#* The same move is used for the boat in Indian chaturaji, a four-player version of chaturanga.
*#* The elephant in Chinese xiangqi has the same move, but is not able to jump over an intervening piece or pawn. 
*#* The elephant in Korean janggi has the same move, but outward from an initial orthogonal step, also without the ability to jump over an intervening piece or pawn.
*# One step forward or one step in any diagonal direction.
*#* The same move is used for the &quot;khon&quot; (nobleman) in Thai makruk and the &quot;sin&quot; (elephant) in Burmese sittuyin, as well as for the silver general in Japanese shogi.
*#* The move was described c. 1030 by Biruni in his book &quot;India&quot;.
*# Two squares in any orthogonal (vertical or horizontal) direction, jumping over the first square; raising the questions of whether the one step forward or one step in any orthogonal direction move for the gold general in Japanese shogi is a Japanese invention and whether the camel’s (1,3) move is, according to tradition, Tamerlane’s invention. 
*#* A piece with such a move is called a dabbābah in some chess variants. The move was described by the Arabic chess master al-Adli c. 840 in his (partly lost) chess work. (The Arabic word &quot;dabbāba&quot; in former times meant a covered siege engine for attacking walled fortifications; today it means &quot;army tank&quot;.)
*#* This is reminiscent of the aforementioned chaturaji, where the elephant moves as a rook.
*#* The German historian Johannes Kohtz (1843–1918) suggests, rather, that this was the earliest move of the Ratha.
* Ashva (horse): moves the same as a knight in chess.
* Padati or Bhata (foot-soldier or infantry); also known as sainika (warrior): moves and captures the same as a pawn in chess, but without a double-step option on the first move.

===Additional rules===
Al-Adli mentions two further rules:
* Stalemate was a win for a stalemated player. This rule appeared again in some medieval chess variants in England c. 1600. According to some sources, there was no stalemate, as the king is forced to move and consequently be captured.
* The player that is first to bare the opponent&#x27;s king (i.e. capture all enemy pieces except the king) wins. In shatranj this is also a win, but only if the opponent cannot bare the player&#x27;s king on his next turn.

<text>Count Baltzar Bogislaus von Platen (29 May 1766 – 6 December 1829) was a Swedish naval officer and statesman. He was Governor-general of Norway from 1827 to 1829.

== Biography ==
A member of the noble Platen family, von Platen was born on the island of Rügen, Swedish Pomerania (now in Germany), to Philip Julius Bernhard von Platen, Field Marshal and Governor General of Pomerania, and Regina Juliana von Usedom.

At age 13 Baltzar entered the Royal Swedish Navy where he served with distinction until resigning in 1800, having attained the rank of captain.

Following the revolution in 1809 he became a member of the Privy Council and, in the following year, received a promotion to rear admiral. He was also made chairman of the Göta Canal directorate charged with constructing a canal across Sweden. The canal, following a design by Thomas Telford, would only be completed in 1832, after von Platen&#x27;s death, but during its construction, he did discover two skilled mechanical engineering brothers John Ericsson and Nils Ericson.

He was appointed Governor-general of Norway on 26 November 1827, a position which he held until his death in Christiania (modern name Oslo), the Norwegian capital, on 6 December 1829.

He was married to Hedvig Elisabeth Ekman. Baltzar von Platen&#x27;s grave is at the side of the Göta Canal in Motala, where it is something of a tourist attraction, especially for canal visitors.

==Honors==
He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1815.

One of the early vessels built at Hammarsten shipyard in Norrköping was named after Baltzar von Platen in 1834.

<text>Shipyard, also called Shipyard Colony, is a Mennonite settlement that is also an administrative village in the Orange Walk District of Belize.

Shipyard was founded in 1958 by Old Colony Mennonites from Chihuahua and Durango states in Mexico. It consists of more than 20 camps (German: &quot;dörfer&quot;), which have German names like &quot;Blumenort&quot; or &quot;Hochfeld&quot;, but outside the Mennonite community they are referred to only by numbers, e. g. &quot;Camp 5&quot; instead of &quot;Reinfeld&quot;.

Most of the population of Shipyard are Plautdietsch-speaking ethnic Mennonites, living in a very integrated community where most of them work as carpenters, farmers and mechanics. Most Mennonites of Shipyard are quite traditional in lifestyle, still using horse and buggy for transportation and tractors with steel wheels for fieldwork. Compared with other Mennonites in Belize, Shipyard is more conservative than Spanish Lookout and Blue Creek, but more modern concerning the use of technology than Upper Barton Creek, Springfield and daughter colonies.

==Population==
Around 1960 the total population of Shipyard was 728. In 1987 it had grown to 1,966. In the 2014 census it had a total population of 3,497 people. In 2017 it has grown to 3,805 people. It is thus the largest Mennonite settlement in Belize. The population have to reached 4,070 as of 2022 census.

<text>Baltzar [[Platen (Pomeranian family)|von Platen]] (24 February 1898 – 29 April 1984) was a Swedish engineer and inventor.

==Biography==
Baltzar von Platen born in Malmö, Sweden. He was the son of Philip Ludvig von Platen and Eva Hedvig Ingeborg Ehrenborg. He first studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy at Lund University.

Together with inventor and entrepreneur Carl Munters (1897–1989), he was the inventor of the gas absorption refrigerator in 1922 while they were both Swedish engineering students at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The Platen-Munters design could operate without a pump. The technique produced &quot;cold&quot; from a heat source such as propane, electricity, or kerosene. In 1923, production by AB Arctic began. In 1925, AB Arctic was purchased by Electrolux, which began selling them worldwide. In 1925, American manufacturer Servel purchased the rights to the Swedish patent for a continuous absorption refrigerator and started to focus on the gas refrigeration market. The company manufactured refrigerators and was the only U.S. manufacturer for many years.

Baltzar von Platen and Carl Munters both received the Polhem Prize (&quot;Polhemspriset&quot;) awarded by Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers in 1925. Baltzar von Platen was awarded the Franklin Institute John Price Wetherill Medal in 1932. He was awarded the Adelsköld Medal (&quot;Adelsköldska medaljen&quot;) in gold from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences during 1940. Von Platen also worked with ASEA, Sweden&#x27;s major electrical company, on the development of a process which used heat and pressure to produce diamonds. Von Platen left the project before it succeeded in producing the first synthetic diamonds in 1953.

Figuring that the United States would eventually become involved in World War II, Freeman signed up for the Marine Reserve in 1940 with the understanding he could finish law school before he fulfilled his required service. The attack on Pearl Harbor ended that arrangement, and on December 31, 1941, he received orders to report to Officer Candidate School at Marine Corps Base Quantico.

After graduating and following training to be an infantry officer, Freeman reported to Camp Elliot, just outside San Diego, California. He was soon assigned to the 9th Marine Regiment, Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines. His unit shipped out overseas for periods of training in New Zealand and Guadalcanal.

On November 1, 1943, Freeman saw his first combat when his unit came ashore at Torokina on Bougainville in what were the first battles of the Bougainville Campaign. A few days later, while he was leading a patrol, he encountered a group of five or six Japanese soldiers in a clearing. An exchange of gunfire followed, and Freeman was wounded in the jaw and left arm. He was evacuated to a US Army hospital on New Caledonia and then to a Naval hospital on Nouméa. He returned to the U.S. in 1944 but never recovered enough movement in his arm to pass a Marine Corps physical to return to combat.

==Political career==

Freeman earned his LL.B. from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1946. He then practiced law in Minneapolis. Freeman also served as secretary (1946-1948) and chairman (1948-1950) of the newly formed Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, was a political aide to his college friend Humphrey, who was mayor of Minneapolis at the time, and managed Humphrey&#x27;s successful 1948 campaign for the U.S. Senate. He ran unsuccessfully for attorney general of Minnesota in 1950 and for governor in 1952.

Freeman was elected governor in 1954, becoming the state&#x27;s first DFL governor, and reelected in 1956 and 1958. He took the unusual action of declaring martial law in the city of Albert Lea on December 11, 1959, to maintain law and order during a strike at the Wilson Packing Company. After 12 days, a federal court ruled that martial law was inappropriate. On November 13, 1955, Freeman was a guest on the variety show &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, which was later called &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

In July 1960, Freeman nominated U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy for president at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.

Following his defeat for reelection as governor in 1960, Freeman was appointed as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture by the newly elected President Kennedy, and he was retained in that post by President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served until January 21, 1969.

==Later life==
Later, Freeman headed two consulting businesses and practiced law in Washington, D.C. He was president and CEO of Business International Corporation from 1970 to 1985.

Freeman died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on February 20, 2003, in Minneapolis. He was buried in that city&#x27;s Lakewood Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Freeman is remembered for submitting proposed legislation to establish the Food Stamp Program for the poor, which is still in use today.

His son Mike Freeman ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1998 and served non-consecutive terms as County Attorney for Hennepin County, Minnesota (1991 to 1999, and 2007 to 2023).

<doc id="237818" wikidata="Q887520" url="?curid=237818" title="Harold Stassen">
<text>Harold Edward Stassen (April 13, 1907 – March 4, 2001) was an American Republican Party politician, military officer, and attorney who was the 25th governor of Minnesota from 1939 to 1943. He was a leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president of the United States in 1948. Though he was considered for a time to be the front-runner, he lost the nomination to New York governor Thomas E. Dewey. He thereafter regularly continued to run for the presidency and other offices, such that his name became most identified with his status as a perennial candidate.

Born in West St. Paul, Minnesota, Stassen was elected as the county attorney of Dakota County, Minnesota after graduating from the University of Minnesota. He won election as Governor of Minnesota in 1938. Stassen is the youngest person elected to that office. He gave the keynote address at the 1940 Republican National Convention. He resigned as governor to serve in the United States Navy during World War II, becoming an aide to Admiral William Halsey Jr. After the war, he became president of the University of Pennsylvania, holding that position from 1948 to 1953. Stassen sought the presidential nomination at the 1948 Republican National Convention, winning a significant share of the delegates on the first two ballots of the convention. During the Republican primaries preceding the convention, he engaged in the Dewey–Stassen debate, the first debate between presidential candidates for which an audio recording was made.

Stassen sought the presidential nomination again at the 1952 Republican National Convention, and helped Dwight D. Eisenhower win the nomination by shifting his support to Eisenhower. After serving in the Eisenhower administration, Stassen sought various offices. Between 1958 and 1990, he campaigned unsuccessfully for the positions of Governor of Pennsylvania, Mayor of Philadelphia, United States Senator, Governor of Minnesota, and United States Representative. He further sought the Republican nomination for president in 1964, 1968, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992.

==Early life (1907–1930)==

Stassen, the third of five children, was born in West St. Paul, Minnesota, to Elsie Emma (née Mueller) and William Andrew Stassen, a farmer and several times mayor of West St. Paul. His mother was German and his father was born in Minnesota, to German and Czech parents. At the age of 11 Stassen graduated from elementary school and four years later graduated from high school. At the University of Minnesota, Stassen was an intercollegiate debater and orator, and captain of the champion university rifle team in 1927. He received his B.A. degree in 1927, and his LL.B. degree from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1929.

==Career==
===Early political career (1930–1938)===

In 1930, after opening a law office with Elmer J. Ryan in South St. Paul, Stassen defeated Alfred Joyce, the incumbent county attorney of Dakota County, and took office on January 5, 1931, months after Joyce was suspended from practicing law. Three years after taking office Stassen was elected president of the Minnesota County Attorneys&#x27; association.

In 1935, Stassen participated in the creation of the Young Republicans committee in Minnesota and was one of three elected to be temporary members of the state committee to carry on pre-convention work and would be elected its chairman later that year. In 1936 Stassen led an effort by the Young Republicans that demanded greater representation for them at county conventions and for their inclusion in state leadership before his tenure as chairman ended later that year.

Stassen was a delegate to the 1936 Republican National Convention. On April 24, 1937, he gave the keynote address at the Minnesota Republican state convention. In October he announced his intention to run for governor in 1938, and formally started his campaign in November. Despite being a member of the party&#x27;s executive committee Stassen seconded a motion preventing a gubernatorial endorsement at the convention in December.

===Governorship (1939–1943)===
On January 2, 1939, Stassen was inaugurated by Chief Justice Henry M. Gallagher. His first action was to order an audit of expenditures in every state department. He later signed into law Minnesota&#x27;s first civil service law. In September 1939 he organized a farm problems conference, attended by the governors of South Dakota, Wisconsin, Kansas, North Dakota, and Illinois or their representatives. World War Two&#x27;s effect on agriculture was the main issue considered. When New York District Attorney and future Governor Thomas E. Dewey traveled to Minneapolis during the 1940 presidential campaign he was introduced by Stassen. By the end of 1939 Stassen&#x27;s approval rating was over 80% and he had the support of over 80% of both Democrats and Farmer-Laborers. Despite the fact that Stassen was then constitutionally ineligible for the presidency because of the requirement for the president to be at least 35 years of age, some Republicans supported his involvement in presidential politics and Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes commented that Stassen was a political upcomer and was more serious than Dewey. During his governorship, Stassen created the Interracial Commission, the first civil rights organization of Minnesota and appointed African-American World War I veteran Samuel Ransom as his military aide.

====World War II====
Stassen, who was reelected as governor of Minnesota in 1940 and 1942, supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy and encouraged the state Republican Party to repudiate American isolationism before the attack on Pearl Harbor. During the 1942 campaign, he announced that, if re-elected, he would resign to serve on active duty with the United States Naval Reserve, which Stassen had joined with the rank of lieutenant commander earlier that year.

Stassen was re-elected governor in November 1942 and, true to his campaign promise, resigned as governor on April 23, 1943, prior to reporting for active duty with the Navy. Although he would run in 13 more elections in his life, this was the last time he would hold an elected office.

After being promoted to the rank of commander, he joined the staff of Admiral William F. Halsey, Commander of the Third Fleet in the Pacific Theater. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for meritorious service in this position. After almost two and a half years of service, he was promoted to the rank of captain on September 27, 1945, and was released from active duty in November of the same year.

Stassen lost some of his political base while overseas, whereas Republican candidates such as Thomas E. Dewey had a chance to increase theirs. Stassen was a delegate at the San Francisco Conference that established the United Nations and was one of the US signatories of the United Nations Charter. He served as president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1948 to 1953. His attempt to increase the prominence of the university football team was unpopular and soon abandoned. From 1953 to 1955, he was the director of President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s short-lived Foreign Operations Administration.

===Presidential politics (1944–1964)===

Stassen was later best known for being a perennial candidate for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States, seeking it nine times between 1944 and 1992 (1944, 1948, 1952, 1964, 1968, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992). He never won the Republican nomination, much less the presidency; in fact, after 1952, he never even came close, but continued to campaign actively and seriously for president until just a year before his death.

Due to his victory in the gubernatorial race, status as America&#x27;s youngest governor and overwhelming approval rating Stassen was touted as a possible future Republican presidential nominee starting in 1940 despite the fact that he would not be constitutionally eligible to serve until 1942 due to the requirement that a President be at least 35 years of age.

Stassen&#x27;s strongest bid for the Republican presidential nomination was in 1948 when he won a series of upset victories in early primaries. His challenge to the front runner, New York Governor and 1944 G.O.P. presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, was serious enough that Dewey challenged Stassen to a debate on the night before the Oregon Republican primary. The May 17 Dewey–Stassen debate was the first recorded modern debate between presidential candidates to take place in the United States. The debate, which concerned the criminalization of the Communist Party of the United States, was broadcast over the radio throughout the nation.

At the convention in Philadelphia, Osro Cobb, the then Republican state chairman in Arkansas, made a seconding speech for Stassen, having been motivated by Stassen&#x27;s promise if nominated to campaign actively in the South. Cobb described the South as &quot;the last frontier to which we can turn for substantial gains for our party – gains that can be held in the years to come. There is a definite affinity between the southern farmer and the grassroots Midwestern Republicans. …Our party simply cannot indulge the luxury of a Solid South, handed on a silver platter to the opposition every four years...&quot;

In the first two rounds of balloting, Stassen finished third behind Dewey, the front runner, and Robert Taft. After the second round, Stassen and Taft bowed out and Dewey was selected unanimously as the nominee on the next ballot. In all Republican conventions since 1948, the nominee has been selected on the first ballot.

Stassen was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1949. Stassen attended &quot;the notorious State Department Policy Conference of October 1949&quot; which although initially not designated secret was given that moniker which Stassen objected to and insisted his contributions were recorded, which was granted. In later Senate testimony he claimed there was a prevailing bias in opposition to his own view on Asiatic policy and ultimately that they, including Philip Caryl Jessup, Owen Lattimore and Lawrence Kaelter Rosinger, were undermining the free-world by pursuing the communist line.

His home-state delegation played a key role in the 1952 Republican contest when, over his objection, his delegates were released to Dwight D. Eisenhower. This swing helped Eisenhower to defeat Robert A. Taft on the first ballot. Stassen served in the Eisenhower Administration, filling posts including director of the Mutual Security Administration (foreign aid) and Special Assistant to the President for Disarmament. During this period, he held cabinet rank and led a quixotic effort (perhaps covertly encouraged by Eisenhower, who had reservations about Richard Nixon&#x27;s maturity for the presidency) to &quot;dump Nixon&quot; at the 1956 Republican National Convention.

==Later life (1964–2001)==

Stassen also ran for:
* Dakota County Attorney (he won in 1930 and 1934);
* Governor of Minnesota on four occasions (he won on his first three attempts in 1938, 1940, and 1942, but was unsuccessful in 1982);
* United States Senate twice (1978 and 1994 in Minnesota);
* Governor of Pennsylvania twice (1958 and 1966)
* Mayor of Philadelphia once (1959);
* U.S. Representative once (he was the Republican nominee against Bruce Vento of Minnesota in 1986).

After leaving the Eisenhower Administration, Stassen campaigned unsuccessfully for governor of Pennsylvania (1958 and 1966) and for mayor of Philadelphia (1959). In 1978, Stassen moved back to Minnesota and ran a campaign for the U.S. Senate. In 1982, he campaigned for the Minnesota governorship and in 1986 for the fourth district congressional seat. He campaigned for the Republican Party presidential nomination in every election except 1956, 1960, and 1972. He was on the ballot in the 1988 New Hampshire Republican primary and received 130 votes, and also received 1 vote in the Democratic primary.

On the death of Happy Chandler in 1991, Stassen became the earliest serving governor of any U.S. state still living. When he died, the title was passed to Charles Poletti, a former governor of New York State. Stassen died of natural causes in 2001 in Bloomington, Minnesota, at the age of 93 and is buried at the Acacia Park Cemetery in Mendota Heights, Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Revenue headquarters near the State Capitol is named for him.

===Religious life===
Raised as a Baptist, Stassen was active with regional Baptist associations as well as many other religious organizations. During the 1960s, he gained a reputation as a liberal, particularly when, as president of the American Baptist Convention in 1963, he joined Martin Luther King Jr. in his March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Much of Stassen&#x27;s political thought came from his religious beliefs. He held important positions in his denomination and in local and national councils of churches. In the latter 1960s and early 1970s, Stassen also participated with the U.S. Inter-religious Committee on Peace, which sponsored a series of conferences on religion and peace. Baptists writing memorials remembered him as much as a church figure as a political candidate. His son Glen Stassen was a prominent Baptist theologian.

==Political positions==

Throughout his life, Stassen was a liberal Republican and challenged the more conservative elements of the Republican Party such as when he opposed Senator Robert A. Taft, favorite son and a leader of the conservative coalition, in Taft&#x27;s home state of Ohio during the 1948 Republican primary. He was seen as breaching political etiquette and was defeated. During the primaries, Taft attacked Stassen&#x27;s liberalism, believing that he was a disguised New Dealer.

===Economics and relations with labor===

During the 1938 Minnesota gubernatorial campaign Stassen ran against the imposition of a sales tax and later in life supported a form of universal basic income in which unemployed mothers of two or more children would be given $115 per month. At a speech for 900 people at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Stassen expressed support for low tariffs, believing that the Republican Party&#x27;s support of high tariffs were no longer beneficial to the American people.

Having established good relationships with both labor unions and business during his time as governor of Minnesota, Stassen had reservations with the Taft-Hartley Act, opposing the law that required union officers to sign affidavits that attested that they were not communists.

===Views on healthcare===

In his 1947 book &quot;Where I Stand!&quot;, Stassen favored a federal-state government health insurance program that paid only the heaviest hospital and medical bills. Every person under Social Security would have been provided with insurance while those not insured by Social Security could have enrolled in the program through payment of an annual fixed fee.

In his failed 1992 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Stassen proposed expanding the Medicare program for pregnant women and children under 10.

===Civil rights===

Throughout his life, Stassen was a staunch supporter of civil rights for African-Americans, having appointed World War I African-American veteran Samuel Ransom to the staff of the Minnesota National Guard during his time as governor of the state, believing that it was the right thing to do. In his earlier years at the University of Minnesota, Stassen participated in a debate squad, where he also was important in integrating it, by accepting Earl Wilkins, the younger brother of NAACP leader Roy Wilkins.

During his time as President of the University of Pennsylvania, Stassen had a hand in integrating African-Americans into the university&#x27;s football team, and also fought for blacks to be integrated into the faculty of the university, as well as for the university to search for black medical students, having found out that there had never been a black at the medical school until he became president.

Stassen later participated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, and as president of the American Baptist Convention supervised the raising of funds to support Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s activities.

===Foreign policy===

Despite having called for the banning of the Communist Party in the United States, Stassen differed from the majority of conservatives with his stances against the embargo on Cuba and military intervention in Vietnam, instead favoring both North and South Vietnam joining the United Nations, where their problems could be settled. In 1995, Stassen described the Vietnam War as a &quot;tragic mistake&quot; and was frustrated at being unable to convince Lyndon B. Johnson to open up negotiations that would have allowed North and South Vietnam to join the United Nations.

===United Nations===

Stassen was one of the founders of the United Nations and supported it throughout his life. When he died on March 4, 2001, aged 93, he was the last living signer of the United Nations Charter.

==Military awards==
* Legion of Merit
* Navy Commendation Ribbon
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with four battle stars
* World War II Victory Medal

===Legion of Merit citation===
Commander Harold E. Stassen, United States Navy, is awarded the Legion of Merit for &quot;exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Assistant Chief of Staff, Administration, and Aide and Flag Secretary on the staff of Commander, THIRD Fleet, from 15 June 1944 to 26 January 1945.&quot;

General Orders: Bureau of Naval Personnel Information Bulletin No. 337 (April 1945) &amp; No. 363 (May 1947)

Action Date: June 15, 1944 – January 26, 1945

==Electoral history==
In his political career, Stassen ran many campaigns for public office. He was elected governor of Minnesota three times, in 1938, 1940, and 1942.

Stassen ran for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 1940, 1944, 1948, 1952, 1964, 1968, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992. As then-Governor of Minnesota, his 1940 bid was just as a favorite-son candidate and after delivering the keynote address, he endorsed the eventual nominee, Wendell Willkie. His 1948 and 1952 campaigns saw him run competitively, whilst his later candidacies never approached viability and were perennial candidate operations.

<text>Valley of Peace (&quot;Valle de Paz&quot; in original Spanish) is a village in the Cayo District of Belize that was founded on March 12, 1982. In 2000 Valley of Peace had a population of 1,809 people. The population in 2007 grew to 2,108.

Valley of Peace was created as a refugee community for immigrants fleeing from the Salvadoran Civil War. Other Central American immigrants, joined the community during the same time. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) implemented a project to assist the immigrants to find a peaceful and safe place to live. At that time, the Prime Minister of Belize was Rt. Hon. George Cadle Price. The project was taken to vote to the Senate and after debating, the majority voted in favor. It was agreed that for every three refugees families, one Belizean family was to be included in the project.

The funding for the project was paid for by UNHCR. They provided food supplies to each family for four months, while they settled. Most of the refugees were peasant farmers, so each family was given one acre of land to live in and fifty acres of land to farm. Throughout that time, the Mennonite Central Committee played a vital role in the survival of the village. They were responsible for taking food supplies to the refugees and distributing them evenly. They also provided the village with water that was transported from the river in a water truck. UNHCR also provided zinc for the roofing and cement for the floor of each house built in the community. By 1985, the villagers started a cooperative with 15 members which grew to 19 by the end of that year. It was the first local shop which provided the village with basic products. In 1992, Valley of Peace was officially registered as one of Belize&#x27;s Villages.
When the project initiated, life in the community was simple. It only had one primary school, so students wishing to further their education had to travel to a high school in Belmopan on a tractor-pulled cart. Now, Valley of Peace has a strong education base. It has two pre-schools, two primary schools and a high school. Students are now able to do their research in the local library or in an internet café.

Most of the men in the community still engage in peasant farming for food and income. Now, the community is a predominant supplier of fruits and vegetables to the Belmopan Market. However, a large part of the younger generation is moving away from farming. Many young people are now going to high school and university to become skilled in various areas. People in the village engage in various activities that keep them busy. For recreation, the village has a complete park with a playground. It also has three major churches which have many practicing members who engage in spiritual-related functions. In 2003, Valley of Peace was considered by the UNHCR as the largest refugee community in Belize.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2010 census, Valley of Peace had a population of 2,111. Of these, 81.7% were Mestizo, 14.2% Ketchi Maya, 2.4% Mixed, 0.7% Mopan Maya, 0.4% Creole, 0.2% Mennonite, 0.1% Asian and 0.1% Caucasian.

<doc id="237822" wikidata="Q1936055" url="?curid=237822" title="Spanish Lookout">
<text>Spanish Lookout is a Mennonite settlement in the Cayo District of Belize in Central America. According to the 2010 census, Spanish Lookout had a population of 2,253 people in 482 households (2005 census has population is 2,300 and 2000 census had population is 1,786). As of the 2022 census, population have increased to 3,108.

The Mennonite community in Spanish Lookout is quite modern: they use cars and other modern conveniences and the overall impression of the settlement is rather like rural North America than Central America or the Caribbean. The citizens of this community speak Plautdietsch as their mother tongue. Most also speak English and Spanish. It is largely an agricultural community with some light industry, furniture making, prefabricated wood houses and the only oil field in production in Belize.

==History==
In 1958 Kleine Gemeinde Mennonites from Mexico moved to Belize, creating the Spanish Lookout settlement. They objected to a new social welfare law in Mexico and arable land was more readily available in Belize. Over time, a number of families left for Manitoba and Nova Scotia, Canada. Nevertheless, the settlement&#x27;s population of 1,108 in 1987 has more than doubled until 2010 through natural growth. In the 1980s, refugees arrived from Guatemala and El Salvador finding employment and schooling for their children within the settlement.
==Location and geographic setting==
Spanish Lookout is accessible via several roads, going north off the Western Highway. The main access to Spanish Lookout is via the Iguana Creek Bridge. The Central Farm entrance takes you across a river, via one of Belize’s two hand-cranked ferries equipped to transport vehicles. Several vehicles can fit on the ferry at once, while larger trucks may pass one or two at a time.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2010 census, Spanish Lookout had a population of 2,253. Of these, 86.8% were Mennonite, 8.7% Mestizo, 2.0% Mixed, 1.4% Caucasian, 0.8% Ketchi Maya and 0.1% Creole.

In terms of languages spoken (multiple answers allowed), 87.9% spoke English, 87.2% German, 27.3% Spanish, 2.4% Creole, 0.6% Ketchi Maya, 0.4% Garifuna, 0.1% Mandarin or Cantonese, 0.1% Mopan Maya, 0.1% Yucatec Maya and 5.1% other languages; 0.2% could not speak.

==Climate==
Spanish Lookout has a tropical climate, with little temperature difference between seasons, but a pronounced rainy season. The warmest month on average is May. The coolest month on average is January.
==Economy==
Spanish Lookout specializes in auto parts and is the country&#x27;s leader in tire hardware and steel imports. It is a major producer of dairy products, poultry, vegetables and cattle produce, supplying the majority of the country with these commodities. The producer of Belize’s most popular chicken brand, Quality Poultry Products, is located at Spanish Lookout. Western Dairies, Belize’s only commercial producer of milk, is also located in the town. Country Foods is Belize&#x27;s main supplier of eggs. As of 2006, Spanish Lookout has the only commercial oilfield within Belize.

<text>Norman Bertram Coleman Jr. (born August 17, 1949) is an American politician, attorney, and lobbyist. From 2003 to 2009, he served as a United States Senator for Minnesota. From 1994 to 2002, he was mayor of Saint Paul, Minnesota. First elected as a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), Coleman became a Republican in 1996. Elected to the Senate in 2002, he was narrowly defeated in his 2008 reelection bid. To date, he is the last Republican to have represented Minnesota in the U.S. Senate.

Born in New York City, Coleman was elected mayor of Saint Paul, Minnesota&#x27;s capital and second-largest city, in 1993 as a member of the Democratic Party. A liberal Democrat in his youth, Coleman shifted to conservatism as an adult. After conflicts with the Democratic Party over his conservative views, Coleman joined the Republican Party. He was reelected mayor a year later as a Republican. While serving as mayor, he was the Republican nominee in the 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election, but lost to former professional wrestler and third-party candidate Jesse Ventura. As mayor of Saint Paul, he helped return the National Hockey League to Minnesota through the Minnesota Wild after an almost decade-long absence.

Coleman challenged incumbent Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone in the 2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota. After Wellstone died in a plane crash a few weeks before the election, he was replaced on the ballot by former Vice President Walter Mondale. Coleman defeated Mondale by over two points. He sought reelection in 2008. In one of the closest elections in the history of the Senate, he lost to former comedian Al Franken by 312 votes out of over three million cast (a margin of just over 0.01%). Since his defeat, Coleman has been a lobbyist and chairs both the Republican Jewish Coalition and the conservative American Action Network.

==Early life and education==
Coleman was born in Brooklyn, the son of Norman Bertram Coleman Sr. and his wife, Beverly (Behrman). His family is Jewish, his paternal grandfather having changed the surname from Goldman to Coleman. He was a graduate of James Madison High School in Brooklyn and Hofstra University on Long Island.

In college, Coleman was an active member of the 1960s counterculture and a liberal Democrat. &quot;Carting a bullhorn around campus, he&#x27;d regularly lecture students about the immorality of the Nixon administration and the Vietnam War.&quot; He was elected president of the student senate during his junior year. Under Coleman, the senate refused to ratify the newspaper&#x27;s editor and her co-editor and cut some funding to the newspaper. But after refusing to swear in the editor on four different occasions, the senate finally backed down. Coleman celebrated his 20th birthday at the Woodstock Festival, and later admitted to smoking marijuana in his youth. He worked as a roadie for Jethro Tull and Ten Years After, among others.

Coleman attended Brooklyn Law School from 1972 until 1974 but received his Juris Doctor from the University of Iowa College of Law in 1976.

== Career ==
After graduating from law school, Coleman joined the office of the Minnesota Attorney General as a prosecutor, eventually rising to chief prosecutor and then solicitor general.

=== Mayor of Saint Paul (1994–2002) ===
Coleman left the attorney general&#x27;s office upon being elected mayor of St. Paul. One of his first acts as mayor was the elimination of underfunded retirement health benefits for city workers.

One of Coleman&#x27;s accomplishments as mayor was to bring professional ice hockey back to Minnesota. In 1993 the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas, Texas. On June 7, 1997, the NHL awarded St. Paul an expansion franchise, later named the Minnesota Wild, that would play in a new arena downtown at the site of Civic Center Arena. The arena, later named the Xcel Energy Center, was built through a public-private partnership, with $65 million from state taxpayers and $30 million from the city.

Coleman also successfully fought property tax increases, freezing property tax rates for the eight years he served as mayor. During his mayoralty, St. Paul&#x27;s job rate grew by 7.1% and 18,000 jobs were added.

While many praised Coleman for his &quot;pragmatic&quot; leadership style and successes in revitalizing St. Paul, critics labeled him an &quot;opportunist&quot;, and he was often at odds with the Democratic Party&#x27;s more liberal members. In 1996 he was sometimes booed at DFL party events or excluded from them altogether.

Coleman joined the Republican Party in 1996 and was reelected mayor of St. Paul in 1997, defeating Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nominee State Senator Sandy Pappas. He is, as of 2024, the last Republican mayor of St. Paul.

===1998 gubernatorial campaign===
While announcing his party switch, Coleman said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t intend&quot; to run for governor in 1998. But his role in bringing professional hockey back to Minnesota and his popularity in St. Paul did help fuel a run for governor that year. He easily won the Republican nomination, facing just token opposition in the primary. In the general election, he faced DFL nominee Hubert H. &quot;Skip&quot; Humphrey III and Reform Party nominee Jesse Ventura. Polls had Coleman and Humphrey tied for first, but Ventura won the election in an upset, with 37% of the vote to Coleman&#x27;s 34.3% and Humphrey&#x27;s 28.1%.
===U.S. Senate (2003–2009)===

Coleman made plans for a second run for governor in 2002, but Karl Rove and George W. Bush persuaded him to challenge incumbent Senator Paul Wellstone in that year&#x27;s election instead. Coleman had served as Wellstone&#x27;s campaign chair in 1996, shortly before his decision to switch to the Republican Party. Coleman easily won the Republican nomination.

Coleman and Wellstone were neck-and-neck in most polls for most of the campaign. On October 25, Wellstone died in a plane crash. The Democrats chose former Vice President Walter Mondale to replace Wellstone on the ballot. Mondale had held the same Senate seat from 1964 to 1977. Coleman defeated Mondale by just over 61,000 votes out of over 2 million cast. He succeeded Dean Barkley, whom Ventura had appointed to serve the remaining two months of Wellstone&#x27;s term.

In April 2003, Coleman told a Capitol Hill reporter that he was a &quot;99% improvement&quot; over Wellstone because he had a better working relationship with the White House. Many Wellstone supporters found this offensive and insulting, and at least one member of Congress urged Coleman to apologize. Coleman issued an apology, explaining that he was referring specifically to the reporter&#x27;s question about the differences between his and Wellstone&#x27;s relationship with the White House, and saying in part, &quot;I would never want to diminish the legacy or memory of Senator Paul Wellstone, and I will accept full responsibility for not having been more accurate in my comments.&quot; In 2004 Coleman campaigned for the chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), but was defeated for the post by Senator Elizabeth Dole in a 28–27 vote.

===2008 reelection campaign===
In 2008, Coleman&#x27;s opponents for reelection were Dean Barkley and the DFL nominee, former Air America host and comedian Al Franken. On the day after the election, Coleman led in the counted votes and claimed victory in the race. Minnesota law requires an automatic recount when the margin between the leading candidates is less than 0.5% of the vote, and the margin between Coleman and Franken was about 0.01%. Barkley came in third with 15%.

The initial results of the recount put Franken ahead by 225 votes out of almost 2.9 million votes cast. On December 24, 2008, Coleman&#x27;s lawyers said it was a &quot;virtual certainty&quot; that he would contest the results of the election.

Coleman&#x27;s term expired on January 3, 2009. On January 5, Franken was certified as the winner of the recount by 225 votes. Coleman filed a legal challenge of the results on January 6, and a three-judge panel was seated.

On February 3, the panel allowed Coleman to introduce evidence that as many as 4,800 absentee ballots were wrongly rejected and should be counted. The Franken campaign had tried to limit Coleman to bringing evidence on only the 650 absentee ballots cited in the initial court filing.

On April 1, the panel ordered that an additional 400 absentee ballots be examined. After examining the 400 ballots on April 6, the panel ordered that an additional 351 ballots be opened and counted. On April 7, the additional 351 ballots were opened and counted before the panel and a packed courtroom. Franken got an additional 198 votes, Coleman gained 111, and other candidates received 42, increasing Franken&#x27;s lead to 312 votes.

On April 13, the three-judge panel issued its final ruling, sweeping aside all of Coleman&#x27;s legal claims and declaring Franken the winner of the race by 312 votes. In its unanimous decision, the panel said, &quot;The overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that the November 4, 2008, election was conducted fairly, impartially and accurately&quot;, and that Franken should be issued a Certificate of Election. The panel ruled that Coleman had failed to prove that mistakes or irregularities in the treatment of absentee ballots had changed the election&#x27;s outcome.

Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on June 1. On June 30, the court unanimously ruled in Franken&#x27;s favor, declaring him the winner of the election, whereupon Coleman conceded.

====Deep Marine Technology and corruption allegations====
While running for reelection in 2008, Coleman was mentioned in a Texas lawsuit by Paul McKim, CEO of Deep Marine Technology (DMT), against Nasser Kazeminy. Kazeminy was a longtime Coleman supporter who owned a controlling share of DMT. The petition alleged that Kazeminy had used DMT to funnel $75,000 or more to Laurie Coleman through her employer, Hays Companies, in order to enrich Senator Coleman. McKim&#x27;s petition covered several issues, of which the Coleman matter was only one. Coleman&#x27;s 2009 Senate financial disclosure form disclosed that Laurie Coleman received a salary from Hays Companies, but Senate rules do not require the salary amount to be revealed. Neither Coleman nor his wife was named as a defendant in the suit. On October 31, minority shareholders in DMT filed a related suit in Delaware Chancery Court. The Delaware suit also alleged that Kazeminy had used DMT to funnel unearned funds to Laurie Coleman through Hays Companies. As in the Texas case, the Colemans were not named as defendants.

Coleman was not charged with any crime regarding allegations of corruption in receiving gifts of $100,000 from Kazeminy. Doug Grow, a &quot;MinnPost&quot; columnist, expressed skepticism about Coleman&#x27;s attorneys&#x27; claim that the lack of charges meant that Coleman and Kazeminy were not guilty of any wrongdoing. Coleman responded with a campaign ad in which he denied the allegations and blamed them on Franken.

In June 2011, the U.S. Justice Department decided not to file charges against Coleman or Kazeminy. Louis Freeh, an attorney for Kazeminy and a former FBI Director in the Clinton Administration, said he learned the Justice Department had ended the investigation in a February 24 meeting with Andrew Levchuk of the department&#x27;s Public Integrity Section in Washington.

Kazeminy hired Freeh to conduct an independent investigation of all charges. He concluded that there was no wrongdoing or impropriety by the Colemans or Kazeminy. Freeh said that both his investigation and a separate Deep Marine board investigation concluded McKim had made false claims in an attempt to force a larger severance package out of Deep Marine. &quot;The Intercept&quot;, questioning Freeh&#x27;s impartiality, reported that nine days after Freeh&#x27;s investigation cleared Kazeminy of wrongdoing, Kazeminy gave Freeh&#x27;s wife a one-half ownership stake in a Palm Beach property valued at $3 million. McKim&#x27;s allegations were repeated hundreds of times in local and national media reports during the waning days of the 2008 election in what Coleman called &quot;multi-million-dollar attacks against my family and Nasser Kazeminy&quot;.

Freeh says McKim later prepared an affidavit that would have recanted his allegations against the Colemans and Kazeminy in exchange for a financial settlement. He concluded that McKim had a clear motive to use false allegations as leverage to enrich himself. McKim still questioned the legitimacy of insurance payments and said he had done nothing wrong, but another of Kazeminy&#x27;s attorneys said his client had not ruled out future litigation against McKim.

A columnist at &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; wrote, &quot;it is possible that the allegations against Coleman may have handed victory to Al Franken.&quot;

== Post-political career ==

In January 2009, Coleman became an adviser to and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.

After Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty announced he would not seek reelection in 2010, it was widely anticipated that Coleman would run for governor in the 2010 gubernatorial election. Polling conducted in late 2009 showed him as the favorite among Republicans. But on January 17, 2010, Coleman announced that he would not run, saying, &quot;The timing on this race is both a bit too soon and a bit too late. It is too soon after my last race and too late to do a proper job of seeking the support of delegates who will decide in which direction our party should go. The commitments I have to my family and the work I am currently engaged in do not allow me to now go forward.&quot;

In 2010, Coleman became chairman and CEO of the American Action Network, which he co-founded. He was considered a front-runner for the position of chair of the Republican National Committee in 2010 in the event that incumbent Michael Steele did not seek reelection. Coleman said he would not run for the chairmanship if Steele ran for reelection, and did not after Steele announced his candidacy.

In 2013, Coleman confirmed he would not challenge Franken in the 2014 Senate election. He also declined to run against Governor Mark Dayton in the 2014 gubernatorial election.

=== Lobbying career ===
In April 2011, Coleman joined Hogan Lovells, an international legal practice, as senior government advisor in its Washington D.C. office. He stepped down as leader of the Government Relations and Public Affairs practice at Hogan Lovells in January 2020, but remains a senior counsel.

Coleman is on the National Advisory Council for the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a bipartisan committee that promotes international engagement and includes every living former U.S. secretary of state. He also works as a lobbyist on behalf of the government of Saudi Arabia. In 2024, he was among the Hogan Lovells lobbyists U.S. Steel hired to navigate legal scrutiny of proposed acquisition of the company by Nippon Steel.

==Political positions==
Coleman&#x27;s politics have changed dramatically during his political career.

=== College ===
In college Coleman was a liberal Democrat and actively involved in the antiwar movement of the early 1970s; he was once suspended for leading a sit-in protest. He ran for student senate and opined in the school newspaper that his fellow students should vote for him because &quot;These conservative kids don&#x27;t fuck or get high like we do (purity, you know) ... Already the cries of motherhood, apple pie, and Jim Buckley reverberate through the halls of the Student Center. Everyone watch out, the 1950s bobby-sox generation is about to take over.&quot;

=== Becoming a Republican ===
While running for mayor in 1993, Coleman wrote in a letter to the City Convention Delegates: &quot;I have never sought any other political office. I have no other ambition other than to be mayor.&quot; In the letter he wrote:
I am a lifelong Democrat. Some accuse me of being the fiscal conservative in this race—I plead guilty! I&#x27;m not afraid to be tight with your tax dollars. Yet, my fiscal conservatism does not mean I am any less progressive in my Democratic ideals. From Bobby Kennedy to George McGovern to Warren Spannaus to Hubert Humphrey to Walter Mondale—my commitment to the great values of our party has remained solid.

In 1996, Coleman chaired Paul Wellstone&#x27;s Senate reelection campaign. In his nomination speech at the 1996 state DFL convention, Coleman said, &quot;Paul Wellstone is a Democrat, and I am a Democrat.&quot; Tensions were so high between Coleman and the DFL party at the time that a number of convention delegates loudly booed Coleman&#x27;s speech.

In December 1996, Coleman announced he was leaving the DFL to join the Republican Party. He cited his frustrations with the Democratic Party and his belief that the Republican Party offered the best chance to continue his efforts to hold the line on taxes and grow jobs.

Coleman&#x27;s critics, mostly DFL party leaders, speculated that his switch was motivated by aspiration to statewide office. As an abortion opponent and a frequent adversary of public employee unions, Coleman was at odds with the DFL leadership. In a letter to supporters announcing the switch, he wrote, &quot;while the political party I belong to changes, nothing about how I govern or what I believe changes at all.&quot; He was reelected mayor of St. Paul in 1997 with nearly 60% of the vote.

=== As senator ===
Coleman was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership. In March 2007 &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked him the fourth most liberal Republican in the Senate. GovTrack, an independent tracking website, also called Coleman a &quot;moderate Republican&quot;.

In September 2008, Coleman joined the bipartisan Gang of 20, which was seeking a solution to the American energy crisis. The group pushed for a bill that would encourage state-by-state decisions on offshore drilling and authorize billions of dollars for conservation and alternative energy.

Coleman received a 14% progressive rating from Progressive Punch and a 73% conservative rating from the conservative SBE Council. Minnesota&#x27;s other senator at the time, Mark Dayton, received ratings of 90% progressive and 9% conservative from the same groups.

=== Specific issues ===
====Energy independence====
Coleman was a strong supporter of bipartisan efforts to create American independence from foreign sources of energy. This included development of alternative sources of energy such as wind, ethanol, and biofuels.

In 2005, Coleman led a bipartisan coalition of 34 senators in securing a renewable fuels package as part of the 2005 Energy Policy Act, which included new standards for renewable fuels and an extension of tax credits for biodiesel, small ethanol producers and wind and livestock waste.

Coleman supported additional oil exploration in the outer continental shelf, but maintained a campaign promise to oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).

On December 11, 2005, Coleman voted to invoke cloture on, thus advancing, a defense appropriations bill that included oil exploration in ANWR. Critics viewed this as a violation of his pledge to oppose such drilling. Coleman said he did so because although he planned to vote against the bill, he did not believe that a filibuster was warranted. His vote notwithstanding, the filibuster held, and Coleman voted to strip the ANWR provision from the bill in a subsequent vote.

Coleman received a score of 33% for 2007 from the League of Conservation Voters, in their view taking the pro-environment position in just five of 14 cases.

====Agriculture====
As a member of the Senate&#x27;s Agriculture Committee, Coleman played an important role in agriculture policy. In 2008 he helped author the Farm Bill. He was praised for his efforts to improve the bill&#x27;s provisions with regard to sugar, a mainstay of northwestern Minnesota&#x27;s economy, as well as the bill&#x27;s dairy program. Coleman also worked for the inclusion of a permanent agriculture disaster assistance program and hailed the bill&#x27;s investments in conservation, nutrition, and renewable energy. He broke with his fellow Republicans in several instances over agriculture policy, notably by voting for the bill to move forward, and ultimately played a critical role in breaking the stalemate that had delayed Senate consideration of the bill.

Coleman twice voted to override President Bush&#x27;s veto of the Farm Bill.

Coleman expressed reservations about supporting DR-CAFTA (Dominican Republic – Central America Free Trade Agreement) unless the interests of the domestic U.S. sugar industry (including Minnesota&#x27;s sugar beet industry) were accommodated. He voted in favor of DR-CAFTA after obtaining quotas imposed on foreign sugar until 2008. He stood behind Bush on August 2, 2005, as the trade agreement was signed into law. &quot;This is a three-year insurance policy that I have purchased for my sugar farmers,&quot; he said.

====Fiscal issues====
Coleman was generally regarded as a fiscal centrist who supported increasing the minimum wage and safeguarding pensions while at the same time supporting broad tax relief and the line-item veto.

Coleman played an important role in the passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. In addition to safeguarding the pensions of all Americans, the legislation is credited with saving the pensions of over 24,000 Northwest Airlines employees and retirees in Minnesota.

Coleman consistently voted to increase the minimum wage as senator.

Coleman had a consistent record of voting for broad tax reform. He supported reductions to the capital gains tax and the marriage penalty, and supported doubling the child tax credit. Coleman also supported elimination of the AMT and death tax. He supported efforts to make permanent the tax cuts enacted by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.

As a member of the Small Business Committee, Coleman opposed eliminating the Microloan program, supported funding for Small Business Development Centers and the HUBZone program, successfully extended tax relief for Section 179 expensing, and cosponsored an amendment to increase funding for the SBA by $130 million.

Coleman is a longtime supporter of the line-item veto, calling it a &quot;no-brainer, the right thing to do.&quot;

====Iraq, Iran, and Israel====
Coleman was a strong supporter of the Iraq War from the start. In 2008, he still supported the war, generally tending to agree with the Bush administration. He was in favor of the eventual removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, but did not support any kind of timetable for their removal until the situation stabilized. An August 2008 &quot;MinnPost&quot; article summarized his position as: &quot;He believes the prospects are good for a drawdown of U.S. troops, but it must be done based on conditions on the ground as reported by commanders in the field, not according to an &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; timetable set for &#x27;political&#x27; reasons in Washington.&quot;

Coleman was also outspoken about the threat Iran poses to Western democracies. He sponsored numerous Congressional Resolutions aimed at Iran, including measures condemning its violations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and other international obligations. Coleman led an effort to bring worldwide pressure on Iran to stop its attempts to enrich uranium, which many believed was the final step in an effort to gain offensive nuclear weapons capabilities.

Coleman co-sponsored several pieces of legislation to increase sanctions on Iran, including divestment of American pension funds in companies that do business with Iran and sanctions against countries that provide it with nuclear technology. In 2007, he said, &quot;For the sake of our national security, the U.S. must ensure that the sensitive nuclear technology that we share with partner countries does not fall into the hands of the Iranians.&quot;

Coleman is an outspoken defender of Israel. He cosponsored the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 and sent then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice a letter urging her to investigate Egypt&#x27;s smuggling of arms to Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip.

====Immigration reform====
Coleman was a strong supporter of Bush&#x27;s 2006 and 2007 attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate, one of the few Republicans to do so, as many called it &quot;amnesty for illegal aliens&quot;.

====Drug control====
Coleman admitted to using marijuana as a youth, and he advocated its legalization while in college. He has said that maturity led him to understand that his drug use was dangerous and has repeatedly stated his opposition to legalized drugs, including marijuana. He has said, &quot;I oppose the legalization of marijuana because, as noted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, marijuana can have serious adverse health effects on individuals. The health problems that may occur from this highly addictive drug include short-term memory loss, anxiety, respiratory illness and a risk of lung cancer that far exceeds that of tobacco products. It would also make our transportation, schools and workplaces, just as examples, more dangerous.&quot;

====Social issues====
 Coleman has campaigned as an anti-abortion candidate since at least 1993. He attributes this position to the death of two of his four children in infancy from a rare genetic disease. He supports limiting stem cell research to adult stem cells and stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, and in July 2006 voted against lifting restrictions on federal research dollars for new embryonic stem cell lines. Coleman is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports embryonic stem cell research. He voted in favor of legislative intervention to prolong the life of severely brain-damaged Floridian Terri Schiavo.

Coleman opposed recognition of same-sex marriages by either the federal or state governments. In his 2002 Senate campaign he pledged support for an amendment to the United States Constitution that would ban any state from legalizing same-sex marriage. In 2004 and 2006 he voted in favor of such an amendment.

As mayor Coleman refused to sign a city proclamation celebrating the annual gay pride festival, explaining his opposition: &quot;What we have had in St. Paul and Minneapolis for many years is signing a joint proclamation making it gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender month. I will say that I support human rights ... And of course that includes sexual orientation. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve felt very strongly that it wasn&#x27;t government&#x27;s responsibility to give proclamations for people&#x27;s sexuality. I don&#x27;t think government has a responsibility to issue awards for one&#x27;s sexuality.&quot; Coleman hired Susan Kimberly, a trans woman, as deputy mayor in 1998. Kimberly also worked as state legislative director in Coleman&#x27;s Minnesota Senate office.

====Social Security====
Coleman supported allowing workers to divert a portion of their Social Security contributions to the creation of individual accounts to be invested in the stock market, a variation of a general plan supporters call &quot;personal accounts,&quot; historically known as privatization. He agreed with Bush&#x27;s statements that the contribution changes would apply to those younger than 55. &quot;The Social Security system for those folks 55 and over will not change in any way, shape or form—no ifs, ands, or buts,&quot; he said.

====Relationship with the Bush administration====
In 2002, the Bush administration persuaded Coleman to run against Wellstone rather than for governor.

In December 2005, Coleman voted for a budget bill that cut funding from a number of programs but kept funding for sugar beet farmers in Minnesota after Rove asked him to support the administration&#x27;s position on the issue. Coleman told &quot;Congress Daily&quot; that he would not vote for a bill that cut sugar beet funding but &quot;Karl Rove called me and asked what I wanted. A few hours later it was out of the bill.&quot;

On March 14, 2006, Coleman called on Bush to replace or reorganize his staff, saying that they did not sufficiently have their &quot;ears to the ground&quot; on matters like Hurricane Katrina, Harriet Miers&#x27;s failed Supreme Court nomination, and the Dubai Ports World controversy, and accusing the administration of having a &quot;tin ear.&quot; He said they showed inadequate &quot;political sensitivity&quot; in their handling of the issues.

On January 22, 2007, Coleman and fellow Republican Senators John Warner and Susan Collins joined Democrats in opposing Bush&#x27;s planned troop increase in Iraq.

====United Nations reform====

Coleman worked to root out corruption at the United Nations, targeting the so-called &quot;oil-for-food&quot; program.

In May 2005, the Senate&#x27;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Coleman, held hearings on abuses of the UN Oil-for-Food program, including oil smuggling, illegal kickbacks and use of surcharges, and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s use of oil vouchers to buy influence abroad. These Oil-for-Food Program Hearings covered corporations (including Bayoil) and several well-known political figures of various nations (including Vladimir Zhironovsky), but are best remembered for the confrontational appearance of British politician George Galloway, then a Member of Parliament (MP) for the RESPECT The Unity Coalition (Respect). Coleman accused Galloway of abuses that Galloway provably denied.

The previous year, Coleman had called on UN Secretary-general Kofi Annan to resign for other alleged program abuses. On June 2, 2006, Coleman responded to criticism that he had insufficiently investigated the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) for sanctions busting, saying that there were legal and cost hurdles. Then Prime Minister of Australia John Howard supported the invasion of Iraq. The Australian ambassador to the U.S., Michael Thawley, met with Coleman in late 2004 to lobby against any investigation of AWB. 

Coleman was selected to be a delegate to the U.N. 61st General Assembly in New York, where he pressed for reform and action on Darfur and Iran.

====Government infrastructure====
On February 10, 2006, in a meeting of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of which Coleman was a member, during testimony of former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown, Coleman attacked Brown for poor leadership during Hurricane Katrina disaster relief efforts, saying, &quot;you didn&#x27;t provide the leadership, even with structural infirmities&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;re not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies&quot;, and &quot;the record reflects that you didn&#x27;t get it or you didn&#x27;t in writing or in some way make commands that would move people to do what has to be done until way after it should have been done.&quot; Brown responded combatively, &quot;well, senator, that&#x27;s very easy for you to say sitting behind that dais and not being there in the middle of that disaster, watching that human suffering and watching those people dying and trying to deal with those structural dysfunctionalities&quot;. and implored Coleman to stick to questions. He later likened Coleman&#x27;s charges to a &quot;drive-by shooting.&quot; Brown had recently said that he notified the Department of Homeland Security and the White House of the tremendous scale of Katrina flooding earlier than had been previously reported.

On March 14, 2006, Coleman introduced a bill that would ban foreign companies from operating ports in the United States.

In March 2007, Coleman introduced legislation (S. 754) to kill the Defense Travel System, a program intended to automate the purchasing of travel services by the U.S. Department of Defense, which accounts for more than half of the federal government&#x27;s total outlays of around $11 billion annually for travel, including transportation, lodging, and rental cars. Shortly after he filed the legislation, Coleman received a generous contribution from the CEO of Carlson Companies, which owns Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a business travel management firm whose CW Government Travel unit provides travel management services for some federal agencies. The Carlson Companies are based in Minnesota. Over the years, Coleman has received tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from people connected with Carlson Companies.

==Personal life==
Coleman married actress Laurie Casserly in 1981. The couple have two children, Jacob and Sarah. Two other children died during infancy (Adam, 1983; Grace, 1992) from a rare genetic disorder known as Zellweger syndrome. In 2016, Jacob Coleman announced his candidacy for an open Minnesota Senate seat held by Julianne Ortman, but did not win the Republican endorsement. Coleman&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Julia Coleman, won election to the state senate seat in 2021.

Coleman is a member of the Freemason fraternity, having been made a Mason at sight in 2003 by then Grand Master of Masons in Minnesota Neil Neddermeyer.

Coleman was on the America Abroad Media advisory board.

On September 11, 2009, Coleman announced he had been diagnosed with Bell&#x27;s palsy. Doctors told him that he should fully recover from it. On August 14, 2018, Coleman announced that cancer he had been battling in his neck and throat had spread to his lungs.

<text>Mullins River is the name of both a river and of a village on that river in the Stann Creek District of Belize.

The village of Mullins River is located at the mouth of the river of the same name on the coast of the Caribbean Sea, north of Dangriga. At the time of the 1904 census, Mullins River had a population of 243 people, but by 2000, the population had dwindled to 198.

==Religious history==
Mullins River was the locus of early missionary activity in 19th century Belize. Some Omoa residents from Spanish Honduras had settled there after the accession of the liberal Morazán to power in Honduras in 1830 In 1832, Fray Antonio began to work among them, building “a small Catholic chapel that was served intermittently by a Catholic priest.” This was the first Catholic chapel in Belize in modern times. In 1836, Fray Rubio from Bacalar replaced Fray Antonio.

During 1830, Baptist minister James Bourne began visiting Mullins River and Stann Creek. He reported the population of each of the communities as about 100. By 1832, the number had grown to 500. In November 1834, Methodists Thomas Jefferies and John Greenwood had arrived in Mullins River, and by 1836, had a chapel and school.

In the mid-1800s, Mullins River was a village of Creole and Spanish people. The Creoles resided in Belize Town and maintained small plantations at Mullins River, which they visited occasionally. The Spanish tended to move between Mullins River itself and Spanish Town, a nearby settlement of immigrants.

In 1840, Apolonia Mejia brought to Mullins River from the Shrine of Nuestro Señor de Esquipulas in southern Guatemala the image of the crucified black Christ. The image was exposed in church for festivities during her life and donated to the church after her death, becoming “an object of public veneration ever since. Pilgrimages have been started from various points of the colony to visit the sacred image.”

The report of Bishop Di Pietro’s visit in 1894 gave the number of Catholics as 243 and the average attendance of children at the school as 48. The school was going on satisfactorily because “the retail liquor license has been stopped, [so] the morality of the place has improved. Formerly Mullins River had a bad reputation but now the people spend their money on improving their plantations instead of wasting it in the liquor shop” The hurricane of 1941 destroyed the 1832 Mullins River Catholic church, which was rebuilt in 1942.

==The town==
By the late 1880s, the &quot;Belize Independent&quot; noted the addition to Mullins River of a few White settlers, with a few Caribs (Garifuna) working up the river at different banks. But in the town itself there were “few or no Carib residents.” The article further described Mullins River as a town with roadways and town operations, with the district magistrate holding court once monthly, and two policemen stationed there. The large Wesleyan population was building a “fine new church and schoolroom.”

Mullins River hosted British Honduras Fruit Company and Belize Fruit Company, the former having been Drake’s Sugar Estate. Further economic activity included private farms of bananas, coconuts, and cacao. Mullins River, navigable by dory for some 25 miles, afforded “a natural highway to the virgin lands at the back as well as for sending down the produce.” The town served also as a playground for many Belize City folk during the vacation months of March through May.”

<doc id="237837" wikidata="Q953124" url="?curid=237837" title="Jake and Dinos Chapman">
<text>Iakovos &quot;Jake&quot; Chapman (born 1966) and Konstantinos &quot;Dinos&quot; Chapman (born 1962) are British visual artists, previously known as the Chapman Brothers. Their art explores deliberately shocking subject matters; for instance, in 2008, they produced a series of works that appropriated original watercolours by Adolf Hitler. In the mid-1990s, their sculptures were included in the YBA showcase exhibitions &quot;Brilliant!&quot; and &quot;Sensation&quot;. In 2003, the two were nominated for the annual Turner Prize but lost out to Grayson Perry. In 2013, their painting &quot;One Day You Will No Longer Be Loved III&quot; was the subject of Derren Brown&#x27;s Channel 4 special &quot;The Great Art Robbery&quot;.

In 2022, with the announcement of Jake Chapman&#x27;s solo show &quot;Me, Myself and Eye&quot;, it was disclosed that the Chapman brothers had ended their professional association. Jake Chapman made reference to mutual &quot;seething disdain&quot; and told the &quot;Guardian&quot; they were both &quot;sick of the partnership&quot; and were &quot;no longer having fresh ideas together&quot;.

==Lives and careers==
Jake Chapman was born in Cheltenham and Dinos Chapman in London. Their father was an English art teacher and their mother an Orthodox Greek Cypriot (hence &quot;Jake&quot; an anglicised diminutive of the orthodox Iakovos, and &quot;Dinos&quot;, a typical diminutive of the orthodox Konstantinos). They were brought up in Cheltenham but moved to St Leonards-on-Sea where they attended a local comprehensive (Christ Church Primary) &amp; (William Parker School). Dinos studied at the Ravensbourne College of Art (1980–83), Jake at the North East London Polytechnic (1985–88) before both together enrolled at the Royal College of Art (1988–90), when they also worked as assistants to the artists Gilbert and George.

===Art collaboration===

They began their own collaboration in 1991. The brothers have often made pieces with plastic models or fibreglass mannequins of people. An early piece consisted of eighty-three scenes of torture and disfigurement derivative of those recorded by Francisco Goya in his series of etchings, &quot;The Disasters of War&quot; (a work they later returned to) rendered into small three-dimensional plastic models. One of these was later turned into a life-size work, &quot;Great Deeds Against the Dead&quot;, shown along with &quot;Zygotic Acceleration, Biogenetic, De-Sublimated Libidinal Model (Enlarged x 1000)&quot; at the &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition in 1997.

Their 1995 mannequin &quot;Two-faced Cunt&quot; was of a naked young girl with two heads joined together by a vagina, which sold for £91,250 in 2011. The Chapman brothers continued with &quot;Fuck Face&quot;, a series of mannequins of children, sometimes fused together, with genitalia in place of facial features. For example, one has a male toddler wearing a bright red smock with an erect penis in place of his nose and an open anus in place of his mouth. It sold for £115,250 in 2010.

Their sculpture &quot;Hell&quot; (2000) consisted of a large number of miniature figures of Nazis arranged in nine glass cases laid out in the shape of a swastika. In 2003, with a series of works named &quot;Insult to Injury&quot;, they altered a set of Goya&#x27;s etchings by adding funny faces. As a protest against this piece, performer Aaron Barschak threw a pot of red paint over Jake Chapman during a talk he was giving in May 2003. (Barshack was imprisoned for one month for the incident.) The Chapmans&#x27; oeuvre has also referenced work by William Blake, Auguste Rodin and Nicolas Poussin. Jake Chapman has published a number of catalogue essays and pieces of art criticism in his own right, as well as a book, &quot;Meatphysics&quot; (Creation Books, 2003). The brothers have also designed a label for Becks beer as part of a series of limited edition labels produced by contemporary artists. Using a title from the Tim Burton film, in 2004 they curated &quot;A Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; as part of the occasional All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival at Camber Sands. In October 2013 the Chapman brothers took part in &quot;Art Wars&quot; at the Saatchi Gallery curated by Ben Moore. The artists were issued with a stormtrooper helmet, which they transformed into a work of art. Proceeds went to the Missing Tom Fund set up by Moore to find his brother Tom who has been missing for over ten years. The work was also shown on the Regents Park platform as part of Art Below Regents Park.

===The Rape of Creativity===
From April–June 2003, the Chapmans held a solo show at Modern Art Oxford entitled &quot;The Rape of Creativity&quot; in which &quot;the &quot;enfants terribles&quot; of Britart, bought a mint collection of Francisco Goya&#x27;s most celebrated prints – and set about systematically defacing them&quot;. The Goya prints referred to his &quot;Disasters of War&quot; set of 80 etchings. The duo named their newly defaced works &quot;Insult to Injury&quot;. BBC described more of the exhibition&#x27;s art: &quot;Drawings of mutant Ronald McDonalds, a bronze sculpture of a painting showing a sad-faced Hitler in clown make-up and a major installation featuring a knackered old caravan and fake dog turds.&quot; While &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented that the Chapman brothers had &quot;managed to raise the hackles of art historians by violating something much more sacred to the art world than the human body – another work of art&quot;, they also noted that the effect of their work was powerful.

The Chapman brothers were nominated for the Turner Prize in 2003. As well as including &quot;Insult to Injury&quot;, their Turner Prize exhibit debuted two new works &quot;Sex&quot; and &quot;Death&quot;. &quot;Sex&quot; directly referenced their previous work &quot;Great Deeds against the Dead&quot;. The original work shows three dismembered corpses hanging from a tree, &quot;Sex&quot; shows the same scenario, but in a heightened state of decay. Additionally clown&#x27;s noses are now present on the skulls of the corpses; snakes, rats and insects (like those found in joke shops) cover the piece. &quot;Death&quot; is two sex dolls, placed on top of each other, head-to-toe in the 69 sex position: despite appearing to be made of plastic it is in fact cast in bronze and painted to look like plastic. That year the prize was eventually won by Grayson Perry.

On 24 May 2004, a fire in a storage warehouse destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection including &quot;Hell&quot;. The brothers subsequently made a very similar, though more extensive, work called &quot;Fucking Hell&quot;.

===Disputes with journalists===
In 2006, the journalist Lynn Barber claimed that she had received a death threat from the brothers, following conducting an interview with them.

In 2007, they were criticised by journalist Johann Hari for adopting an anti-Enlightenment philosophy, and for Jake Chapman saying that the boys who murdered Liverpool toddler James Bulger performed &quot;a good social service&quot;. This followed a public media brawl between Jake Chapman and journalist Carole Cadwalladr in &quot;The Observer&quot; and on the internet the previous year. Cadwalladr told readers that Chapman told her she made him &quot;feel sick&quot; and threw her out of their studio &quot;into the pouring rain&quot;, ordering her to &quot;get out, just get the fuck out!&quot;. Chapman made two profanity-laden, ranting, poorly-spelled public replies; the first was addressed to Cadwalladr, making reference to her &quot;hopelessly toothless&quot; wit and making offensive reference to things he claimed to associate with her which he stated made him &quot;quite queasy&quot;, including &quot;kippers&quot; and &quot;frumpy laura ashley blouses reeking of stale mothballs&quot; . In the second, to &quot;The Observer&quot;, addressing Cadwalladr&#x27;s employers as &quot;unobservant dullards&quot; and making reference to Cadwalladr as &quot;gwendalin silverspoongob&quot; , he claimed to be &quot;laughing at the sheer arrogance in documenting such a forgettable meeting&quot; and concluded &quot;you may grace your readers with the meek tones of plum-mouthed middle-Englanders, but don&#x27;t send them round to my studio I&#x27;ll make [...] mince meat out of them, ha ha ha.&quot;

===Art by Adolf Hitler===
In May 2008, White Cube gallery exhibited 13 apparently authenticated watercolours painted by Adolf Hitler, to which the brothers had added hippie motifs. Jake Chapman described most of the dictator&#x27;s works as &quot;awful landscapes&quot; which they had &quot;prettified&quot;. The central device and context of this exhibition were strikingly similar to those of the artist Ira Waldron in her project &quot;Die Damen mit den Hündchen&quot;, first exhibited at the Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary art in May 2007. Waldron also entered into an artistic duel with Hitler, seen as a mediocre bohemian artist, by overlaying her motifs and colour on to expanded copies of thirteen of his drawings.

Also included in the Chapmans&#x27; 2008 exhibition was &quot;Fucking Hell&quot; and a series of doctored eighteenth and nineteenth century-style aristocratic portraits in oils.

In 2011, in their &quot;Human Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Introspastic&quot; series, the Chapman Brothers produced further works based on the same Hitler drawings of Geli Raubal and his dogs which had been previously appropriated by Ira Waldron in her 2007 exhibition.

===Letter to Culture Secretary===
On 1 October 2010, the brothers were co-signatories to an open letter to the British government&#x27;s Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt (featuring previous Turner Prize nominees winners) which opposed any future cuts in public funding for the arts.

<text>Placencia is a small village located in the Stann Creek District of Belize.

==History==
Prior to the European colonization of the Americas, the Placencia Peninsula was inhabited by the Maya. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Maya in this area produced salt and traded it with other settlements along the coast.

In the 17th century, Placencia was settled by English Puritans, originally from Nova Scotia and Providence Island. This settlement died out during the Spanish American wars of independence in the 1820s.

The Placencia Peninsula was resettled in the late 1800s by several families. Placencia prospered and soon became a village, earning its livelihood from the sea.

The Spaniards that traveled the southern coast of Belize gave Placencia its name. At that time Placencia was called Placentia, with the point being called Punta Placentia, or Pleasant Point.

In the late 20th century it became a significant tourism destination, and is now referred to as Placencia Village, or simply Placencia.

On October 8, 2001, Hurricane Iris hit southern Belize with winds causing major damage to nearly 95% of buildings in Placencia. Many developers took advantage of plummeted real estate value and an increased development of the peninsula and Placencia proper is consistently on the rise, as well as property value.

==Location and geographic setting==
The eastern side of the Peninsula is a long expanse of white sand beach and heavy mangrove in some areas; the western side is bounded by a long narrow north–south trending bay of the Caribbean Sea. Significant settlements on the peninsula from North to South include Riversdale Village, Maya Beach Village, the Garifuna village of Seine Bight and finally, Placencia Village. Placencia, the southernmost village on the peninsula, is served by Placencia Airport.

==Demographics== 
The village is home to 1,512 permanent residents according to the 2010 census, while the Placencia Peninsula is home to 3,458 permanent residents, which includes citizens and ex-pats alike. At the time of the 2010 census, 41.9% of the population of Placencia were Creole, 24.5% Mestizo, 10.0% Mixed, 9.2% Caucasian, 3.2% Mopan Maya, 2.9% Garifuna, 2.7% Ketchi Maya, 2.5% East Indian, 1.0% Asian, 0.4% Yucatec Maya, 0.3% African and 1.3% others. 

==Attractions==
*&quot;Placencia&quot;, it used to be a fishing village but now offers some tourist amusement such as bars and entertainment like kayaking, snorkeling, diving, saltwater fly fishing, whale shark watching during the full moons between April and July of each year, light tackle saltwater fishing, as well as numerous restaurants and local art gallery.
*Diving at Gladden Spit from &quot;Placencia&quot;: Cubera snappers aggregate to spawn at Gladden Spit typically from 2 days before to 12 days after full moon from March to September with more than 10000 individuals. This event attracts many predators as well as whale sharks. 
*&quot;Placencia Village&quot;, hosts the Placencia Lobster Fest, the Placencia Peninsula Arts Festival, Easter Week (similar to US Florida Spring Break).
*&quot;Placencia Lagoon&quot;, with manatees, dolphins, rays (the Lagoon is a nursery for some species of rays), mangrove forests, birding by canoe or kayak, fishing (juvenile tarpon, snook, barracuda), wetlands and sea grass beds.
*&quot;Mayan ruins of Nim Li Punit and Lubantuum&quot; are in the Toledo District, a day trip from the Placencia Peninsula.

*&quot;Mayflower Archaeological Reserve&quot;, 3 post-classic Maya ruins: Mayflower, T&#x27;au Witz and Maintzunun and waterfalls.
*&quot;Bladen River Reserve&quot;
*Maya Beach Village is a tiny community on the Placencia Peninsula, midway between Placencia Village to the south and Riversdale Village to the north. The closest village is Seine Bight, a historic Garifuna settlement. Approximately long, the Maya Beach area is made up of homes, small resorts and a few retail establishments including two small grocery stores, a half-dozen bars &amp; restaurants, and an art gallery.

<doc id="237846" wikidata="Q513250" url="?curid=237846" title="Eric Rudolph">
<text>Eric Robert Rudolph (born September 19, 1966), also known as the Olympic Park Bomber, is an American domestic terrorist convicted of a series of bombings across the Southern United States between 1996 and 1998, which killed two people and injured over 100 others, including the Centennial Olympic Park bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. His stated motive was an opposition to &quot;the ideals of global socialism&quot; and to &quot;abortion on demand&quot;, both of which he claimed were condoned by the United States government. For five years, Rudolph was listed as one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives until he was caught in 2003.

In 2005, as part of a plea bargain, Rudolph pleaded guilty to numerous state and federal homicide charges and accepted four consecutive life sentences in exchange for avoiding a trial and a potential death sentence. He remains incarcerated at the ADX Florence supermax prison near Florence, Colorado.

==Early life==
Rudolph was born in Merritt Island, Florida, in 1966. After his father Robert died in 1981, he moved with his mother and siblings to Nantahala, Macon County, in western North Carolina.

Rudolph attended ninth grade at the Nantahala School but dropped out after that year and worked as a carpenter with his older brother Daniel. When Rudolph was 18, he spent time with his mother at a Christian Identity compound in Missouri known as the Church of Israel.

After Rudolph received his GED, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, undergoing basic training at Fort Benning in Georgia. He was discharged in January 1989, due to marijuana use, while serving with the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. In 1988, the year before his discharge, Rudolph had attended the Air Assault School at Fort Campbell. He attained the rank of Specialist/E-4.

Rudolph joined several white supremacist groups in the years before he perpetrated the bombings.

==Bombings==

At age 29, Rudolph perpetrated the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, which occurred on July 27, 1996, during the 1996 Summer Olympics. He made two anonymous 911 calls, warning about the bomb before it detonated. The blast killed one spectator and wounded 111 others. A 40-year-old Turkish news cameraman suffered a fatal heart attack while running to the scene.

Rudolph&#x27;s motive for the bombing, according to his April 13, 2005 statement, was political:
In the summer of 1996, the world converged upon Atlanta for the Olympic Games. Under the protection and auspices of the regime in Washington millions of people came to celebrate the ideals of global socialism. Multinational corporations spent billions of dollars, and Washington organized an army of security to protect these best of all games. Even though the conception and the purpose of the so-called Olympic movement is to promote the values of global socialism as perfectly expressed in the song &quot;Imagine&quot; by John Lennon, which was the theme of the 1996 Games—even though the purpose of the Olympics is to promote these ideals, the purpose of the attack on July 27 was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.

The plan was to force the cancellation of the games, or at least create a state of insecurity in order to empty the streets around the venues and thereby eat into the vast amounts of money that had been invested in them.

Rudolph&#x27;s statement cleared Richard Jewell, a Centennial Olympic Park security guard, of any involvement in the bombing. Despite having been initially hailed as a hero for being the first one to spot Rudolph&#x27;s explosive device and helping to clear the area, Jewell came under FBI scrutiny in the days following the attack, ultimately becoming the prime suspect and the subject of international media attention.

Rudolph confessed to three other bombings: 1) an abortion clinic in the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs on January 16, 1997, 2) the Otherside Lounge of Atlanta, a lesbian bar, on February 21, 1997, injuring five, and 3) an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Alabama on January 29, 1998, killing Birmingham police officer Robert Sanderson, who was off-duty but working as security in uniform, and critically injuring nurse Emily Lyons. Rudolph&#x27;s bombs contained nails, which acted as shrapnel.

==Fugitive==
Rudolph was first identified as a suspect in the Alabama bombing by the Department of Justice on February 14, 1998, following tips from two witnesses, Jeffrey Tickal and Jermaine Hughes. Tickal and Hughes observed Rudolph departing the scene and noted his appearance and truck license plate. He was named as a suspect in the other Atlanta and Alabama incidents on October 14, 1998.

On May 5, 1998, he became the 454th fugitive listed by the FBI on the Ten Most Wanted list. The FBI considered him to be armed and extremely dangerous, and offered a $1 million reward for information leading directly to his arrest. He spent more than five years in the Appalachian wilderness as a fugitive, during which time federal and amateur search teams scoured the area without success.

Rudolph&#x27;s family supported him and believed he was innocent of all charges. They were questioned and placed under surveillance. On March 7, 1998, Rudolph&#x27;s older brother, Daniel, videotaped himself cutting off his left hand with a radial arm saw in order to, in his words, &quot;send a message to the FBI and the media.&quot; The hand was successfully reattached later by surgeons.
According to Rudolph&#x27;s own writings, he survived during his years as a fugitive by camping in the Nantahala National Forest near Cherokee and Graham Counties, in North Carolina, by gathering acorns and salamanders, pilfering vegetables from gardens, stealing grain from a grain silo, and raiding dumpsters in Murphy, North Carolina.

==Arrest and guilty plea==

Rudolph was arrested in Murphy, North Carolina, on May 31, 2003, by rookie police officer Jeffrey Scott Postell of the Murphy Police Department while Rudolph was looking through a dumpster behind a Save-A-Lot store at about 4:00a.m. Postell, on routine patrol, had initially suspected a burglary in progress.

Rudolph was unarmed and did not resist arrest. When arrested, he was clean-shaven with a trimmed mustache, had dyed black hair and wore a camouflage jacket, work clothes, and new sneakers. Federal authorities charged him on October 14, 2003. Rudolph was initially defended by attorney Richard S. Jaffe. After Jaffe withdrew, he was represented by Judy Clarke.

In April 2005, the Department of Justice announced that Rudolph had agreed to a plea bargain under which he would plead guilty to all charges he was accused of in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. The deal was confirmed after the FBI found of dynamite he had hidden in the forests of North Carolina. His revealing the hiding places of the dynamite was a condition of his plea agreement. He made his pleas in person in Birmingham and Atlanta courts on April 13.

Rudolph released a statement explaining his actions; he rationalized the bombings as serving the cause of anti-abortion and anti-gay terrorism. In his statement, he claimed that he had &quot;deprived the government of its goal of sentencing me to death,&quot; and that &quot;the fact that I have entered an agreement with the government is purely a tactical choice on my part and in no way legitimates the moral authority of the government to judge this matter or impute my guilt.&quot;

The terms of the plea agreement were that Rudolph would be sentenced to four consecutive life terms. He was sentenced July 18, 2005, to two consecutive life terms without parole for the 1998 murder of a police officer. He was sentenced for his bombings in Atlanta on August 22, 2005, receiving two consecutive life terms. That same day, Rudolph was sent to the ADX Florence Supermax federal prison. Like other Supermax inmates, he spends 23 hours per day alone in his concrete cell.

Rudolph unsuccessfully tried to have part of his sentence vacated in 2021.

==Motivations==
After Rudolph&#x27;s arrest for the bombings, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the FBI considered Rudolph to have &quot;had a long association with the Christian Identity movement, which asserts that Northern European whites are the direct descendants of the lost tribes of Israel, God&#x27;s chosen people.&quot; Christian Identity is a white supremacist movement which holds the view that those who are not white Christians cannot be saved. In the same article, the &quot;Post&quot; reported that some FBI investigators believe that Rudolph may have written letters in which he claimed responsibility for the nightclub and abortion clinic bombings on behalf of the Army of God, a group that sanctions the use of force to combat abortions and is associated with Christian Identity.

In a statement released after he entered a guilty plea, Rudolph denied being a supporter of the Christian Identity movement, claiming that his involvement amounted to a brief association with the daughter of a Christian Identity adherent, later identified as Daniel Gayman. When asked about his religion he said &quot;I was born a Catholic, and with forgiveness I hope to die one.&quot; In other written statements, Rudolph has cited biblical passages and offered religious motives for his militant opposition to abortion.

Some books and media outlets, like the NPR radio program &quot;On Point,&quot; have described Rudolph as a &quot;Christian Identity extremist&quot;; &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; referred to him as a &quot;Christian terrorist.&quot; The Voice of America reported that Rudolph could be seen as part of an &quot;attempt to try to use a Christian faith to try to forge a kind of racial and social purity.&quot; Writing in 2004, authors Michael Shermer and Dennis McFarland saw Rudolph&#x27;s story as an example of &quot;religious extremism in America,&quot; warning that the phenomenon he represented was &quot;particularly potent when gathered together under the umbrella of militia groups&quot;.

The Anti-Defamation League noted in 2003 that &quot;extremist chatter on the Internet has praised Rudolph as &#x27;a hero&#x27; and some followers of hate groups are calling for further acts of violence to be modeled after the bombings he is accused of committing.&quot;

In a letter to his mother from prison, Rudolph has written, &quot;Many good people continue to send me money and books. Most of them have, of course, an agenda; mostly born-again Christians looking to save my soul. I suppose the assumption is made that because I&#x27;m in here I must be a &#x27;sinner&#x27; in need of salvation, and they would be glad to sell me a ticket to heaven. I do appreciate their charity, but I could really do without the condescension. They have been so nice I would hate to break it to them that I really prefer Nietzsche to the Bible.&quot; His mother would state she saw this as evidence of his intellectual side, not as a denial of his Catholic faith.

Rudolph has said, &quot;The truth is I am a Christian&quot;. Rudolph remained unremorseful for his actions and, in a statement before the court, called his acts against abortion providers a “moral duty.” “As I go to a prison cell for a lifetime, I know that ‘I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith,’” Rudolph said, quoting scripture.
In his work &quot;White Lies: Abortion, Eugenics, And Racism&quot; Rudolph expresses his admirations towards Catholicism.

==Writings from prison==

Essays written by Rudolph that condone violence and militant action have been published on the Internet by an Army of God anti-abortion activist. Although victims maintain that Rudolph&#x27;s messages are harassment and could incite violence, the prison can do little to restrict their publication, according to Alice Martin, who was the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama when Rudolph was prosecuted for the Alabama bombing. &quot;An inmate does not lose his freedom of speech,&quot; she said.

As reported in an April 8, 2013, Alabama blog article, Rudolph&#x27;s book &quot;Between the Lines of Drift: The Memoirs of a Militant&quot; was published, with help from his brother, by Lulu.com in February 2013. In April 2013, the U.S. Attorney General seized $200 to help pay off the $1 million that Rudolph owes in restitution to the state of Alabama. The book has since been republished and has been made available through the Army of God website.

==In popular culture==
In a fictionalized portrayal, Rudolph appears as the primary antagonist in season 2 of the drama anthology series &quot;Manhunt&quot;, portrayed by Jack Huston. He is portrayed by Eric Mendenhall in the 2019 film &quot;Richard Jewell&quot;.

<doc id="237849" wikidata="Q7695921" url="?curid=237849" title="Telecommunications in Timor-Leste">
<text>==Telephones==

Following Indonesia&#x27;s withdrawal from East Timor in 1999, the telecommunications infrastructure was destroyed in the ensuing violence, and Telkom Indonesia ceased to provide services. A new country code (670) was allocated to East Timor by the International Telecommunication Union, but international access often remained severely limited.

The calling code 670 was previously used by the Northern Marianas (the Northern Marianas, as part of the North American Numbering Plan, now uses the &quot;country code&quot; 1 and the &quot;area code&quot; 670).

Telephone calls are also often extremely expensive: for example, Telstra in Australia raised the cost of calls to East Timor to A$3.00 a minute from 97 cents in 2003. In the UK, BT&#x27;s standard rate is over £2 a minute.

Telstra expanded its cellular telephone signal into East Timor in 2000 and operated services until 2003, when Timor Telecom (TT), 50.1% part-owned by Portugal Telecom, began operating fixed-line and mobile telephone services. Until recently, the fixed-line network was mainly confined to the capital Dili, although this has been expanded nationwide, to each district capital.

According to a press release issued by Portugal Telecom in June 2008, the total number of fixed phones (landline) was 3,000 and mobile cellular was 103,000. At that time, there was no broadband or ADSL service.

In 2019, the World Bank reported that the total number of mobile cellular subscriptions is 1,425,256, or 110.2% of the population of Timor Leste, and the total number of fixed telephone subscriptions is 2,075, or 0.16% of the population.

In 2002, Timor Telecom signed a 15-year contract to invest US$29 million to rebuild and operate the phone system. The contract could be extended by 10 more years, totaling 25 years of monopoly. 2003 gross revenue totaled €10.5 million. In 2012 the government and TT agreed to end the contract, thus allowing the telecommunications market to be liberalised.

All voice and data are carried out by Intelsat, using a direct satellite link with one hop to their downlink in Portugal.

The telephone system suffered significant damage during the violence in the East Timorese independence. As a result, there is very little fixed-line service, and mobile-cellular service and coverage are limited primarily to urban areas.

Timor Telecom offers mobile GSM services covering approximately 92% of the population, 100% of the districts, and 57% of the sub-districts.

International service is available in major urban centers, but not much elsewhere.

On January 17, 2013, the Prime Minister of Timor Leste, Mr. Xanana Gusmão, launched Telkomcel as the second telecommunication operator in Timor Leste with three main services:

# Mobile Services
# Corporate Solution
# Wholesale &amp; International Services&#x27;

Telkomcel is 100% owned by PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia International (TELIN).

==Radio==

There are at least 21 radio stations in East Timor. The main station is Radio Timor Leste, broadcasting in Tetum, Portuguese and Indonesian. Other radio stations include Radio Kmanek, and Radio Falintil, and Radio Renascença, while there are also FM retransmissions of RDP Internacional from Portugal, Radio Australia, and the BBC World Service. Community radio stations broadcast around the country, in regional languages such as Tokodede and Fataluku.

==Television==

East Timor has one national public broadcaster, &quot;Televisão Timor Leste&quot; or &quot;Televizaun Timor Lorosae&quot;, which broadcasts local programming in Tetum and Portuguese, as well as retransmissions of RTP Internacional from Portugal.

In May 2007, RTTL&#x27;s television and radio services became available via satellite, using a transponder leased from Telkom Indonesia.

In February 2009, TVTL began carrying programmes from Rede Globo in Brazil.

==Internet==

The first Internet connection in East Timor was made by the United Nations APDIP Programme in 1999 to support UNTAET, the UN Transitional Administration. This consisted of a C Band link to Singapore Telecom. The initial bandwidth was 256 kbit/s.

The Internet country code for East Timor is .tl. This code was officially changed from .tp (for Portuguese Timor) when the country achieved its independence on 20 May 2002.

There are three mobile operators in Timor-Leste providing the bulk of Internet connectivity to the population using 3G, 4G LTE, and HSDPA:

# Telemor
# Timor Telecom
# Telkomcel

While ADSL and dedicated line infrastructure is offered by some of the operators, it is prohibitively expensive to install and is in most cases more expensive per GB than cellular options. Most individuals, organisations, and businesses thus rely on the cellular network for their Internet needs using smartphones, 4G modems and 4G routers.

A fourth operator, Ceslink has applied to the government for a license to become a telecom operator, but as of September 2019 offers no services to the public.

All operators rely on satellite communication for their uplink to the wider internet, which results in slow response times and drives up data prices. A project to physically connect Timor-Leste to Indonesia using a submarine fiber optic cable has been greenlit by the Government in 2018, but as of 2019, no progress appears to have been made.

Alternatively, in January 2022 it was announced Timor Leste Telecommunications provider SACOMTEL had signed an agreement with global subsea cable systems provider Inligo Networks to become the landing partner for a new cable system between the USA and Singapore called the Asia Connect Cable or ACC-1. The news was further confirmed by Inligo Networks some days later. The system is expected to connect the country in 2024.

According to the International Telecommunication Union, 13.4% of the population was connected to the internet with the vast majority of users using cellular internet. However, according to the World Bank, in 2015, 23% of the population is connected to the Internet. As of 2017, 27.493% of the population is connected to the Internet. According to Timor Telecom about 94% of the population is able to access cellular phone and internet services.

Timor Telecom has sought to block some voice over IP services on its network such as Skype, however in 2019 there is no evidence to suggest that any operators are blocking specific services or protocols.

The concept of net neutrality does not seem to apply to Timor-Leste&#x27;s and operators. Telemor and Telkomcel offer heavily discounted social media packages, with a focus on services owned by Facebook. Telkomcel also offers their customers limited free access to services under the Internet.org umbrella.

<text>David John Lodge (28 January 1935 – 1 January 2025) was an English author and critic. He was a literature professor at the University of Birmingham until 1987, and some of his novels satirise academic life, notably the &quot;Campus Trilogy&quot; – &quot;Changing Places: A Tale of Two Campuses&quot; (1975), &quot;Small World: An Academic Romance&quot; (1984) and &quot;Nice Work&quot; (1988). The second two were shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Another theme is Roman Catholicism, beginning from his first published novel &quot;The Picturegoers&quot; (1960). Lodge also wrote television screenplays and three stage plays. After retiring, he continued to publish literary criticism. His edition of &quot;Twentieth Century Literary Criticism&quot; (1972) includes essays on 20th-century writers such as T. S. Eliot. In 1992, he published &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot;, a collection of essays on literary techniques with illustrative examples from great authors, such as &quot;Point of View&quot; (Henry James), &quot;The Stream of Consciousness&quot; (Virginia Woolf) and &quot;Interior Monologue&quot; (James Joyce), beginning with &quot;Beginning&quot; and ending with &quot;Ending&quot;.

==Biography==
Lodge was born in Brockley, south-east London. His family home until 1959 was 81 Millmark Grove, a residential street of 1930s terraced houses between Brockley Cross and Barriedale. His father, a saxophonist, played in a dance band. Lodge&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;The Picturegoers&quot; (1960), draws on early experiences in &quot;Brickley&quot; (based on Brockley) and his childhood home, which he revisits again in later novels, &quot;Therapy&quot; (1995), &quot;Deaf Sentence&quot; (2008) and &quot;Quite A Good Time to be Born: A Memoir&quot; (2015). The Second World War forced Lodge and his mother to evacuate to Surrey and Cornwall. He attended the Catholic St Joseph&#x27;s Academy, Blackheath.

===University studies===
In 1952, Lodge entered University College London, where he gained a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in 1955. There he met his future wife, Mary Frances Jacob, as a fellow student, when they were 18. Meanwhile, he wrote a first, unpublished novel (1953): &quot;The Devil, the World and the Flesh&quot;. After graduating from university, Lodge spent two years in the Royal Armoured Corps on national service, which provided a basis for his novel &quot;Ginger You&#x27;re Barmy&quot;. He then returned to London University, earning a Master of Arts in 1959 for a thesis on &quot;The Catholic Novel from the Oxford Movement to the Present Day&quot;.

===Family and early career===
In 1959, Lodge and Jacob married at the age of 24. Lodge later said, &quot;It seems extraordinary now. I had no prospects, no job, little money, but it never bothered me. We didn&#x27;t really want children at the point they came along, but we got on with it.&quot; They had children in 1960 and 1963, a son and a daughter, and a second son, Christopher, born in 1966 with Down Syndrome.

From 1959 to 1960, Lodge taught English in London for the British Council. In 1960, he gained a job as a lecturer at the University of Birmingham, where he was preparing a PhD thesis on the Oxford Movement. At Birmingham, Lodge met the novelist Malcolm Bradbury, who was to become his &quot;closest writer friend&quot;; the example of Bradbury&#x27;s comic writing was, according to Lodge, a major influence on the development of his own work in this respect. In 1963, Lodge collaborated with Bradbury and another student, James Duckett, on a satirical revue for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre entitled &quot;Between These Four Walls&quot;, performed in the autumn of 1963. The cast included Julie Christie. During the performance of a certain skit that involved a radio being played on stage, Lodge and the audience heard news of the assassination of John F. Kennedy: In August 1964, Lodge and his family went to the United States, on a scholarship from the Harkness Commonwealth Fellowship. It required Lodge to travel at least three months out of twelve in the United States, with a car provided by the donor. The family first lived in Providence, Rhode Island, where David Lodge followed the American literature course at Brown University. During this period, free of teaching obligations, Lodge was able to complete a third novel, &quot;The British Museum Is Falling Down&quot;. Lodge&#x27;s original title for the novel was &quot;The British Museum Has Lost Its Charm&quot;, a line from a George and Ira Gershwin song, but he was refused permission to use it by the Gershwin Publishing Corporation. In March 1965 the family went on a trip across the country, eventually moving to San Francisco.

In 1966, Lodge published his first book of academic criticism, &quot;Language of Fiction&quot;, and in 1967 defended his doctoral thesis for a PhD in English awarded in 1967 by Birmingham University.

===Later career===
From 1967 to 1987, Lodge continued his academic career at the University of Birmingham, becoming Professor of English Literature in 1976, while writing several more novels and essays. In 1969, he became an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Lodge retired from his post at Birmingham in 1987 to become a full-time writer: He retained the title of Honorary Professor of Modern English Literature and continued to live in Birmingham. Some of his papers are housed in the University Library&#x27;s Special Collections. In 1997, Lodge was made a &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et Lettres&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture. In the 1998 New Years Honours list, he was appointed CBE for his services to literature.

===Death===
Lodge died in Birmingham on 1 January 2025, at the age of 89.

==Works==
===Overview===
Lodge&#x27;s first published novels evoke the atmosphere of post-war England (for example, &quot;The Picturegoers&quot; (1960)). The theme recurs in later novels, through the childhood memories of certain characters (&quot;Paradise News&quot;, 1992; &quot;Therapy&quot;, 1995). The war is covered in &quot;Out of the Shelter&quot; (1970), while &quot;Ginger You&#x27;re Barmy&quot; (1962) draws on Lodge&#x27;s experience of military service in the 1950s. The &quot;Guardian&quot; review of the 2011 reissue of &quot;Ginger You&#x27;re Barmy&quot;, called the novel &quot;an impressively humane and feelingly political indictment of a tawdry postwar compromise&quot; and &quot;a moving glimpse of a world on the cusp of change&quot;.

Lodge was brought up a Catholic and described himself as an &quot;agnostic Catholic&quot;. Many of his characters are Catholic and their Catholicism, particularly the relationship between Catholicism and sexuality, is a major theme. &quot;The British Museum Is Falling Down&quot; (1965) and &quot;How Far Can You Go?&quot; (1980; published in the US as &quot;Souls and Bodies&quot;), examine the difficulties faced by orthodox Catholics due to the prohibition of artificial contraception. Other novels where Catholicism plays an important part include &quot;Small World&quot; (in the character of Persse), &quot;Paradise News&quot; (1991) and &quot;Therapy&quot; (1995). In &quot;Therapy&quot;, the protagonist Laurence Passmore (&quot;Tubby&quot;) has a breakdown after his marriage fails. He reminisces about his adolescent courtship with his first girlfriend at a Catholic youth club and seeks her out while she is on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Lodge has said that if read chronologically, his novels depict an orthodox Roman Catholic becoming &quot;less and less so as time went on&quot;.

Several of Lodge&#x27;s novels satirise the academic world. The Campus Trilogy (&quot;Changing Places&quot;, &quot;Small World&quot; and &quot;Nice Work&quot;) are set at a fictional English Midland university of &quot;Rummidge&quot;, modelled on Birmingham. (The name &quot;Rummidge&quot; appears to be derived from Brummagem, the local nickname for Birmingham, by removing the first and last letters and altering the spelling.) The novels share characters, notably the Rummidge English literature lecturer Philip Swallow and his American counterpart, Professor Morris Zapp, who aspires to be &quot;the highest paid Professor of English in the world&quot;. Swallow and Zapp first cross paths in &quot;Changing Places&quot;, where they swap jobs for an exchange scheme (and later, swap wives). Lodge has called the plot of the novel &quot;a narrative transformation of the thematic material and the socio-cultural similarities and differences I had perceived between Birmingham and Berkeley,&quot; during his visiting professorship.

Other fictional universities appear in Lodge&#x27;s novels. Persse McGarrigle in &quot;Small World&quot; is a doctoral student at a fictional University College Limerick, the book having been written before the foundation of a real University of Limerick. Another campus novel, &quot;Thinks...&quot;, is set in a fictional University of Gloucester, before the foundation of the University of Gloucestershire.

Lodge&#x27;s novels cover the world of business in &quot;Nice Work&quot;, that of television in &quot;Therapy&quot;, and deafness and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in &quot;Deaf Sentence&quot;. The last draws on Lodge&#x27;s own hearing problems: &quot;I hate my deafness; it&#x27;s a comic infirmity as opposed to blindness which is a tragic infirmity&quot;. Lodge has said of his own work, &quot;Each of my novels corresponds to a particular phase or aspect of my own life [but] this does not mean they are autobiographical in any simple, straightforward sense.&quot;

Two of Lodge&#x27;s later novels follow the lives of authors: &quot;Author, Author&quot; (2004) about Henry James and &quot;A Man of Parts&quot; (2011) about H. G. Wells. &quot;Author, Author&quot; suffered from comparison with Colm Tóibín&#x27;s novel about Henry James, &quot;The Master&quot;, published six months earlier and then shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Most reviews of Lodge&#x27;s novel dwelt on its unfortunate timing. Lodge wrote about the experience in &quot;The Year of Henry James&quot; (2006).

In 2015, &quot;Quite a Good Time to Be Born&quot; was published: an autobiography covering Lodge&#x27;s life from 1935 to 1975.

===Influences and allusions===
Lodge&#x27;s major influences include English Catholic novelists (the subject of his MA dissertation), notably Graham Greene. Of his contemporaries, he has been compared most often to his friend Malcolm Bradbury, also an exponent of the campus novel. Lodge has acknowledged this debt:

&quot;&quot;The British Museum Is Falling Down&quot; was the first of my novels that could be described as in any way experimental. Comedy, it seemed, offered a way of reconciling a contradiction, of which I had long been aware, between my critical admiration for the great modernist writers, and my creative practice, formed by the neo-realist, anti-modernist writing of the 1950s. My association with Malcolm Bradbury, and the example of his own work in comedy, was therefore a crucial factor in this development in my writing.&quot; Lodge said that he &quot;was once rung up by a man to settle a bet by declaring whether I was the same person as Malcolm Bradbury&quot;.

As an academic, Lodge was an early UK proponent of the work of Mikhail Bakhtin. Lodge also alludes frequently in his novels to other literary works. &quot;The British Museum Is Falling Down&quot; is influenced by &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; by Virginia Woolf and &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce in that all of the action takes place in one day. The novel is mostly seen from the point of view of Adam Appleby, but the last chapter contains a long stream-of-consciousness section from the point of view of Adam&#x27;s wife Barbara, modelled on Molly Bloom&#x27;s famous soliloquy at the end of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. The novel contains a number of other passages that parody well-known writers, a fact not recognised by most reviewers when it was first published.

&quot;Small World&quot; makes constant reference to Arthurian legend, in the plot, character names and allusions made by the characters (all academics). Lodge says of the novel&#x27;s genesis, 

===Dissemination and reception===
Lodge&#x27;s work first came to wider notice in Britain in 1975, when he won the Hawthornden prize for &quot;Changing Places&quot;. He went on to win the Whitbread Book of the Year award in 1980 for &quot;How Far Can You Go?&quot; and the Sunday Express Book of the Year in 1988 for &quot;Nice Work&quot;. Two of his early novels were reissued during this period (&quot;Ginger You&#x27;re Barmy&quot;, 1962/1982, and &quot;The British Museum is Falling Down&quot;, 1965/1981). His novels appeared in paperback in the 1960s with Pan and Panther Books, with Penguin Books from 1980 and with Vintage Publishing (Random House Group) since 2011. Vintage has reissued most of his earlier work. Lodge has been shortlisted for the Booker Prize twice, for &quot;Small World&quot; and &quot;Nice Work&quot;, and in 1989, Lodge chaired the Booker Prize judges. His 1970 novel &quot;Out of the Shelter&quot; was long-listed for the Lost Man Booker Prize in 2010. Anthony Burgess called Lodge &quot;one of the best novelists of his generation&quot;.

====International publication====
Lodge&#x27;s work first received recognition in France in the early 1990s, after the publication by Rivages of two of his novels, &quot;Nice Work&quot; and &quot;Changing Places&quot;. These were followed in 1991 by &quot;Small World&quot; and &quot;The British Museum Is Falling Down&quot;. Since then almost all his works of fiction have been translated – his new works fairly quickly. His present publisher in France is Payot et Rivages.

His books are routinely translated into other languages, including Czech, Estonian, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and Turkish.

===Narrative techniques===
In &quot;The Art of Fiction (1992)&quot;, Lodge studied, through examination of extracts from novels, various stylistic devices (repetition, variation in levels of language, etc.) and narrative techniques (varying viewpoints, defamiliarisation, etc.). Lodge self-consciously uses many of these techniques in his own novels. For example, in &quot;Paradise News&quot; (1991) the narration is mostly third-person point of view, but there are also first-person narratives (diary and autobiography, letters, postcards, emails) and various other documents, such as theoretical writings on tourism. In &quot;Therapy&quot; (1995) the bulk of the novel is told through the protagonist&#x27;s diary, but there are other texts, presented as written by minor characters about the main character. It is eventually revealed that these were all written by the main character, as part of a therapy exercise.

==Television==
Two of Lodge&#x27;s novels have been adapted into television serials: &quot;Small World&quot; (1988), and &quot;Nice Work&quot; (1989). &quot;Nice Work&quot; was adapted by Lodge himself and filmed at the University of Birmingham. He also adapted his play &quot;The Writing Game&quot; for television (1995). In 1994 Lodge adapted Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; for a BBC series.

==Theatre==
Lodge wrote three plays: &quot;The Writing Game&quot;, &quot;Home Truths&quot; (which he later turned into a novella), and &quot;Secret Thoughts&quot; (based on his novel &quot;Thinks...&quot;).

In his autobiography &quot;Quite a Good Time To Be Born: a Memoir, 1935–75&quot; (2015), Lodge notes that The Old Rep was one of his favourite theatres, with a long distinguished history and the likes of Laurence Olivier, Edith Evans, Ralph Richardson, Albert Finney and Derek Jacobi performing there. He referred to the theatre as &quot;a gem&quot;, but noted that shabby as it was then, he could not have had a better venue for his first attempt at writing for the professional stage.

&quot;The Writing Game&quot; is about the staff, teachers and students at a residential course for writers. The action is interspersed with readings by the characters of their own works in progress. According to Lodge, the play &quot;originated in the experience of teaching such a course myself – not because its plot bears any resemblance to what happened on that course, but because it struck me that the bare situation possessed the classic dramatic unities of time, place and action. Indeed it would be true to say that I invented the plot of my play to fulfil the dramatic possibilities inherent in the situation.&quot; The play opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre on 13 May 1990 and ran for three weeks. An American production was staged at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts in March 1991. Lodge later adapted the play for television. It was broadcast on Channel 4 on Sunday 18 February 1996, attracting 1.2 million viewers.

&quot;Home Truths&quot; was performed at the Birmingham Rep in 1998. The story mainly focuses on Adrian Ludlow, a semi-retired writer interviewed by Fanny Tarrant, a journalist famous for sarcastic portrayals. Lodge later rewrote it as a novella of the same name.
Lodge adapted his novel &quot;Thinks ...&quot; as a two-character play, &quot;Secret Thoughts&quot;, which opened at the Octagon Theatre, Bolton on 12 May 2011. &quot;The Stage&quot; called it &quot;an intriguing, intensely witty, brainy play... one of the most compelling two-handers imaginable&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s review said that &quot;Lodge&#x27;s novel boils down neatly into an intellectually and erotically charged dialogue on the nature of the mind&quot;, yet felt that &quot;Lodge cannot quite eradicate the sense that some of the cerebral jousting has a more natural home in a novel than on stage.&quot; &quot;Secret Thoughts&quot; won Best New Play at the Manchester Theatre Awards, hailed as a &quot;bracing and ambitious production that wowed everyone who saw it&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==

<doc id="237864" wikidata="Q4168282" url="?curid=237864" title="Differintegral">
<text>In fractional calculus, an area of mathematical analysis, the differintegral is a combined differentiation/integration operator. Applied to a function ƒ, the &quot;q&quot;-differintegral of &quot;f&quot;, here denoted by
:formula_1
is the fractional derivative (if &quot;q&quot; &gt; 0) or fractional integral (if &quot;q&quot; &lt; 0). If &quot;q&quot; = 0, then the &quot;q&quot;-th differintegral of a function is the function itself. In the context of fractional integration and differentiation, there are several definitions of the differintegral.

==Standard definitions==

The four most common forms are:

*The Riemann–Liouville differintegralThis is the simplest and easiest to use, and consequently it is the most often used. It is a generalization of the Cauchy formula for repeated integration to arbitrary order. Here, formula_2. formula_3
*The Grunwald–Letnikov differintegralThe Grunwald–Letnikov differintegral is a direct generalization of the definition of a derivative. It is more difficult to use than the Riemann–Liouville differintegral, but can sometimes be used to solve problems that the Riemann–Liouville cannot. formula_4
*The Weyl differintegral This is formally similar to the Riemann–Liouville differintegral, but applies to periodic functions, with integral zero over a period.
*The Caputo differintegralIn opposite to the Riemann-Liouville differintegral, Caputo derivative of a constant formula_5 is equal to zero. Moreover, a form of the Laplace transform allows to simply evaluate the initial conditions by computing finite, integer-order derivatives at point formula_6. formula_7

==Definitions via transforms==

The definitions of fractional derivatives given by Liouville, Fourier, and Grunwald and Letnikov coincide. They can be represented via Laplace, Fourier transforms or via Newton series expansion.

Recall the continuous Fourier transform, here denoted formula_8:
formula_9

Using the continuous Fourier transform, in Fourier space, differentiation transforms into a multiplication:
formula_10

So,
formula_11
which generalizes to
formula_12

Under the bilateral Laplace transform, here denoted by formula_13 and defined as formula_14, differentiation transforms into a multiplication
formula_15

Generalizing to arbitrary order and solving for formula_16, one obtains
formula_17

Representation via Newton series is the Newton interpolation over consecutive integer orders:

formula_18

For fractional derivative definitions described in this section, the following identities hold:

:formula_19
:formula_20
:formula_21

==Basic formal properties==

*&quot;Linearity rules&quot; formula_22
formula_23
*&quot;Zero rule&quot; formula_24
*&quot;Product rule&quot; formula_25

In general, &quot;composition (or semigroup) rule&quot; is a desirable property, but is hard to achieve mathematically and hence is not always completely satisfied by each proposed operator; this forms part of the decision making process on which one to choose:

* formula_26 (ideally)
* formula_27 (in practice)

<text>In category theory, the product of two (or more) objects in a category is a notion designed to capture the essence behind constructions in other areas of mathematics such as the Cartesian product of sets, the direct product of groups or rings, and the product of topological spaces. Essentially, the product of a family of objects is the &quot;most general&quot; object which admits a morphism to each of the given objects.

==Definition==

===Product of two objects===

Fix a category formula_1 Let formula_2 and formula_3 be objects of formula_1 A product of formula_2 and formula_3 is an object formula_7 typically denoted formula_8 equipped with a pair of morphisms formula_9 formula_10 satisfying the following universal property:
* For every object formula_11 and every pair of morphisms formula_12 formula_13 there exists a unique morphism formula_14 such that the following diagram commutes:

Whether a product exists may depend on formula_15 or on formula_2 and formula_17 If it does exist, it is unique up to canonical isomorphism, because of the universal property, so one may speak of &quot;the&quot; product. This has the following meaning: if formula_18 is another product, there exists a unique isomorphism formula_19 such that formula_20 and formula_21.

The morphisms formula_22 and formula_23 are called the canonical projections or projection morphisms; the letter formula_24 alliterates with projection. Given formula_11 and formula_26 formula_27 the unique morphism formula_28 is called the product of morphisms formula_29 and formula_30 and is denoted formula_31

===Product of an arbitrary family===

Instead of two objects, we can start with an arbitrary family of objects indexed by a set formula_32

Given a family formula_33 of objects, a product of the family is an object formula_34 equipped with morphisms formula_35 satisfying the following universal property: 
*For every object formula_11 and every formula_37-indexed family of morphisms formula_38 there exists a unique morphism formula_39 such that the following diagrams commute for all formula_40

The product is denoted formula_41 If formula_42 then it is denoted formula_43 and the product of morphisms is denoted formula_44

===Equational definition===

Alternatively, the product may be defined through equations. So, for example, for the binary product:
* Existence of formula_28 is guaranteed by existence of the operation formula_46
* Commutativity of the diagrams above is guaranteed by the equality: for all formula_47 and all formula_48 formula_49
* Uniqueness of formula_28 is guaranteed by the equality: for all formula_51 formula_52

===As a limit===

The product is a special case of a limit. This may be seen by using a discrete category (a family of objects without any morphisms, other than their identity morphisms) as the diagram required for the definition of the limit. The discrete objects will serve as the index of the components and projections. If we regard this diagram as a functor, it is a functor from the index set formula_37 considered as a discrete category. The definition of the product then coincides with the definition of the limit, formula_54 being a cone and projections being the limit (limiting cone).

===Universal property===

Just as the limit is a special case of the universal construction, so is the product. Starting with the definition given for the universal property of limits, take formula_55 as the discrete category with two objects, so that formula_56 is simply the product category formula_57 The diagonal functor formula_58 assigns to each object formula_34 the ordered pair formula_60 and to each morphism formula_28 the pair formula_62 The product formula_63 in formula_15 is given by a universal morphism from the functor formula_65 to the object formula_66 in formula_57 This universal morphism consists of an object formula_34 of formula_15 and a morphism formula_70 which contains projections.

==Examples==
In the category of sets, the product (in the category theoretic sense) is the Cartesian product. Given a family of sets formula_71 the product is defined as
formula_72
with the canonical projections
formula_73

Given any set formula_11 with a family of functions formula_38 
the universal arrow formula_76 is defined by formula_77

Other examples:
* In the category of topological spaces, the product is the space whose underlying set is the Cartesian product and which carries the product topology. The product topology is the coarsest topology for which all the projections are continuous.
* In the category of modules over some ring formula_78 the product is the Cartesian product with addition defined componentwise and distributive multiplication.
* In the category of groups, the product is the direct product of groups given by the Cartesian product with multiplication defined componentwise.
* In the category of graphs, the product is the tensor product of graphs.
* In the category of relations, the product is given by the disjoint union. (This may come as a bit of a surprise given that the category of sets is a subcategory of the category of relations.)
* In the category of algebraic varieties, the product is given by the Segre embedding.
* In the category of semi-abelian monoids, the product is given by the history monoid.
* In the category of Banach spaces and short maps, the product carries the  norm. 
* A partially ordered set can be treated as a category, using the order relation as the morphisms. In this case the products and coproducts correspond to greatest lower bounds (meets) and least upper bounds (joins).

==Discussion==

An example in which the product does not exist: In the category of fields, the product formula_79 does not exist, since there is no field with homomorphisms to both formula_80 and formula_81

Another example: An empty product (that is, formula_37 is the empty set) is the same as a terminal object, and some categories, such as the category of infinite groups, do not have a terminal object: given any infinite group formula_83 there are infinitely many morphisms formula_84 so formula_83 cannot be terminal.

If formula_37 is a set such that all products for families indexed with formula_37 exist, then one can treat each product as a functor formula_88 How this functor maps objects is obvious. Mapping of morphisms is subtle, because the product of morphisms defined above does not fit. First, consider the binary product functor, which is a bifunctor. For formula_89 we should find a morphism formula_90 We choose formula_91 This operation on morphisms is called Cartesian product of morphisms. Second, consider the general product functor. For families formula_92 we should find a morphism formula_93 We choose the product of morphisms formula_94

A category where every finite set of objects has a product is sometimes called a Cartesian category
(although some authors use this phrase to mean &quot;a category with all finite limits&quot;).

The product is associative. Suppose formula_15 is a Cartesian category, product functors have been chosen as above, and formula_96 denotes a terminal object of formula_1 We then have natural isomorphisms
formula_98
formula_99
formula_100
These properties are formally similar to those of a commutative monoid; a Cartesian category with its finite products is an example of a symmetric monoidal category.

==Distributivity==

For any objects formula_101 of a category with finite products and coproducts, there is a canonical morphism formula_102 where the plus sign here denotes the coproduct. To see this, note that the universal property of the coproduct formula_103 guarantees the existence of unique arrows filling out the following diagram (the induced arrows are dashed):

The universal property of the product formula_104 then guarantees a unique morphism formula_105 induced by the dashed arrows in the above diagram. A distributive category is one in which this morphism is actually an isomorphism. Thus in a distributive category, there is the canonical isomorphism
formula_106

<doc id="237871" wikidata="Q1386729" url="?curid=237871" title="FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives">
<text>The FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives is a most wanted list maintained by the United States&#x27;s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The list arose from a conversation held in late 1949 between J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, and William Kinsey Hutchinson, International News Service (the predecessor of the United Press International) editor-in-chief, who were discussing ways to promote capture of the FBI&#x27;s &quot;toughest guys&quot;. This discussion turned into a published article, which received so much positive publicity that on March 14, 1950, the FBI officially announced the list to increase law enforcement&#x27;s ability to capture dangerous fugitives. The first person added to the list was Thomas J. Holden, a robber and member of the Holden–Keating Gang on the day of the list&#x27;s inception.

Individuals are generally only removed from the list if they are captured, die, or if the charges against them are dropped; they are then replaced by a new entry selected by the FBI. In eleven cases, the FBI removed individuals from the list after deciding that they were no longer a &quot;particularly dangerous menace to society&quot;. Machetero member Víctor Manuel Gerena, added to the list in 1984, was on the list for 32 years, which was longer than anyone else. Billie Austin Bryant spent the shortest amount of time on the list, being listed for two hours in 1969. The oldest person to be added to the list was Eugene Palmer on May 29, 2019, at 80 years old. On rare occasions, the FBI will add a &quot;Number Eleven&quot; if that individual is extremely dangerous but the Bureau does not feel any of the current ten should be removed. Despite occasional references in the media, the FBI does not rank their list; no suspect is considered &quot;#1 on the FBI&#x27;s Most Wanted List&quot; or &quot;The Most Wanted&quot;.

The list is commonly posted in public places such as post offices. Some people on the list have turned themselves in. On May 18, 1996, after surrendering at the U.S. embassy in Guatemala City, Leslie Isben Rogge became the first person on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list to be apprehended due to the FBI&#x27;s then-new home page on the internet. The FBI maintains other lists of individuals, including the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, along with crime alerts, missing persons, and other fugitive lists.

On June 17, 2013, the list reached a cumulative total of 500 fugitives having been listed. As of February 21, 2025, 534 fugitives had been listed, eleven of them women, and 496 of them were captured or located (93%), 163 (31%) of them due to public assistance.

==New additions==
The Criminal Investigative Division (CID) at FBI Headquarters calls upon all 56 Field Offices to submit candidates for the FBI&#x27;s &quot;Ten Most Wanted Fugitives&quot; list. The nominees received are reviewed by special agents in the CID and the Office of Public Affairs. The selection of the proposed candidates is forwarded to the assistant director of the CID for their approval and then to the FBI&#x27;s Director for final approval. This process takes some time, which is why James Joseph &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger Jr., who was arrested in Santa Monica, California on June 22, 2011, remained on the list until May 9, 2012, despite no longer being at large. Osama bin Laden similarly remained on the list for almost a year after his death at the hands of U.S. forces on May 2, 2011.

On occasion, fugitives have been added to the list at the request of local law enforcement. For example, Bureau director Clarence M. Kelley added Twymon Myers to the list in 1973 at the request of New York City Police Commissioner Donald Cawley.

==Former lists==
==List as of February 2025 ==
Rewards are offered for information leading to capture of fugitives on the list; the reward is a minimum of $250,000 (until May 2023: $100,000) for all fugitives.

<doc id="237876" wikidata="Q2672013" url="?curid=237876" title="Deformation (engineering)">
<text>In engineering, deformation (the change in size or shape of an object) may be &quot;elastic&quot; or &quot;plastic&quot;.
If the deformation is negligible, the object is said to be &quot;rigid&quot;.

==Main concepts==
Occurrence of deformation in engineering applications is based on the following background concepts:
* &quot;Displacements&quot; are any change in position of a point on the object, including whole-body translations and rotations (rigid transformations).
* &quot;Deformation&quot; are changes in the relative position between internals points on the object, excluding rigid transformations, causing the body to change shape or size. 
* &quot;Strain&quot; is the &quot;relative&quot; &quot;internal&quot; deformation, the dimensionless change in shape of an infinitesimal cube of material relative to a reference configuration. Mechanical strains are caused by mechanical stress, &quot;see stress-strain curve&quot;.

The relationship between stress and strain is generally linear and reversible up until the yield point and the deformation is elastic. Elasticity in materials occurs when applied stress does not surpass the energy required to break molecular bonds, allowing the material to deform reversibly and return to its original shape once the stress is removed. The linear relationship for a material is known as Young&#x27;s modulus. Above the yield point, some degree of permanent distortion remains after unloading and is termed plastic deformation. The determination of the stress and strain throughout a solid object is given by the field of strength of materials and for a structure by structural analysis.

In the above figure, it can be seen that the compressive loading (indicated by the arrow) has caused deformation in the cylinder so that the original shape (dashed lines) has changed (deformed) into one with bulging sides. The sides bulge because the material, although strong enough to not crack or otherwise fail, is not strong enough to support the load without change. As a result, the material is forced out laterally. Internal forces (in this case at right angles to the deformation) resist the applied load.

== Types of deformation ==

Depending on the type of material, size and geometry of the object, and the forces applied, various types of deformation may result. The image to the right shows the engineering stress vs. strain diagram for a typical ductile material such as steel. Different deformation modes may occur under different conditions, as can be depicted using a deformation mechanism map.

Permanent deformation is irreversible; the deformation stays even after removal of the applied forces, while the temporary deformation is recoverable as it disappears after the removal of applied forces.
Temporary deformation is also called elastic deformation, while the permanent deformation is called plastic deformation.

===Elastic deformation===
The study of temporary or elastic deformation in the case of engineering strain is applied to materials used in mechanical and structural engineering, such as concrete and steel, which are subjected to very small deformations. Engineering strain is modeled by infinitesimal strain theory, also called &quot;small strain theory&quot;, &quot;small deformation theory&quot;, &quot;small displacement theory&quot;, or &quot;small displacement-gradient theory&quot; where strains and rotations are both small.

For some materials, e.g. elastomers and polymers, subjected to large deformations, the engineering definition of strain is not applicable, e.g. typical engineering strains greater than 1%, thus other more complex definitions of strain are required, such as &quot;stretch&quot;, &quot;logarithmic strain&quot;, &quot;Green strain&quot;, and &quot;Almansi strain&quot;. Elastomers and shape memory metals such as Nitinol exhibit large elastic deformation ranges, as does rubber. However, elasticity is nonlinear in these materials.

Normal metals, ceramics and most crystals show linear elasticity and a smaller elastic range.

Linear elastic deformation is governed by Hooke&#x27;s law, which states:

:formula_1
where
* is the applied stress;
* is a material constant called Young&#x27;s modulus or elastic modulus;
* is the resulting strain.

This relationship only applies in the elastic range and indicates that the slope of the stress vs. strain curve can be used to find Young&#x27;s modulus (). Engineers often use this calculation in tensile tests. The area under this elastic region is known as resilience.

Note that not all elastic materials undergo linear elastic deformation; some, such as concrete, gray cast iron, and many polymers, respond in a nonlinear fashion. For these materials Hooke&#x27;s law is inapplicable.

===Plastic deformation===

This type of deformation is not undone simply by removing the applied force. An object in the plastic deformation range, however, will first have undergone elastic deformation, which is undone simply be removing the applied force, so the object will return part way to its original shape. Soft thermoplastics have a rather large plastic deformation range as do ductile metals such as copper, silver, and gold. Steel does, too, but not cast iron. Hard thermosetting plastics, rubber, crystals, and ceramics have minimal plastic deformation ranges. An example of a material with a large plastic deformation range is wet chewing gum, which can be stretched to dozens of times its original length.

Under tensile stress, plastic deformation is characterized by a strain hardening region and a necking region and finally, fracture (also called rupture). During strain hardening the material becomes stronger through the movement of atomic dislocations. The necking phase is indicated by a reduction in cross-sectional area of the specimen. Necking begins after the ultimate strength is reached. During necking, the material can no longer withstand the maximum stress and the strain in the specimen rapidly increases. Plastic deformation ends with the fracture of the material.

== Failure ==

===Compressive failure===
Usually, compressive stress applied to bars, columns, etc. leads to shortening.

Loading a structural element or specimen will increase the compressive stress until it reaches its compressive strength. According to the properties of the material, failure modes are yielding for materials with ductile behavior (most metals, some soils and plastics) or rupturing for brittle behavior (geomaterials, cast iron, glass, etc.).

In long, slender structural elements — such as columns or truss bars — an increase of compressive force &quot;F&quot; leads to structural failure due to buckling at lower stress than the compressive strength.

===Fracture===

A break occurs after the material has reached the end of the elastic, and then plastic, deformation ranges. At this point forces accumulate until they are sufficient to cause a fracture. All materials will eventually fracture, if sufficient forces are applied.

==Types of stress and strain==

Engineering stress and engineering strain are approximations to the internal state that may be determined from the external forces and deformations of an object, provided that there is no significant change in size. When there is a significant change in size, the true stress and true strain can be derived from the instantaneous size of the object.

=== Engineering stress and strain ===
Consider a bar of original cross sectional area being subjected to equal and opposite forces pulling at the ends so the bar is under tension. The material is experiencing a stress defined to be the ratio of the force to the cross sectional area of the bar, as well as an axial elongation:

Subscript 0 denotes the original dimensions of the sample. The SI derived unit for stress is newtons per square metre, or pascals (1 pascal = 1 Pa = 1 N/m2), and strain is unitless. The stress–strain curve for this material is plotted by elongating the sample and recording the stress variation with strain until the sample fractures. By convention, the strain is set to the horizontal axis and stress is set to vertical axis. Note that for engineering purposes we often assume the cross-section area of the material does not change during the whole deformation process. This is not true since the actual area will decrease while deforming due to elastic and plastic deformation. The curve based on the original cross-section and gauge length is called the &quot;engineering stress–strain curve&quot;, while the curve based on the instantaneous cross-section area and length is called the &quot;true stress–strain curve&quot;. Unless stated otherwise, engineering stress–strain is generally used.

=== True stress and strain ===
In the above definitions of engineering stress and strain, two behaviors of materials in tensile tests are ignored:

* the shrinking of section area
* compounding development of elongation

&quot;True stress&quot; and &quot;true strain&quot; are defined differently than engineering stress and strain to account for these behaviors. They are given as

Here the dimensions are instantaneous values. Assuming volume of the sample conserves and deformation happens uniformly,

:formula_2

The true stress and strain can be expressed by engineering stress and strain. For true stress,

:formula_3

For the strain,

:formula_4

Integrate both sides and apply the boundary condition,

:formula_5

So in a tension test, true stress is larger than engineering stress and true strain is less than engineering strain. Thus, a point defining true stress–strain curve is displaced upwards and to the left to define the equivalent engineering stress–strain curve. The difference between the true and engineering stresses and strains will increase with plastic deformation. At low strains (such as elastic deformation), the differences between the two is negligible. As for the tensile strength point, it is the maximal point in engineering stress–strain curve but is not a special point in true stress–strain curve. Because engineering stress is proportional to the force applied along the sample, the criterion for necking formation can be set as formula_6

:formula_7

This analysis suggests nature of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) point. The work strengthening effect is exactly balanced by the shrinking of section area at UTS point.

After the formation of necking, the sample undergoes heterogeneous deformation, so equations above are not valid. The stress and strain at the necking can be expressed as:

:formula_8

An empirical equation is commonly used to describe the relationship between true stress and true strain.

:formula_9

Here, is the strain-hardening exponent and is the strength coefficient. is a measure of a material&#x27;s work hardening behavior. Materials with a higher have a greater resistance to necking. Typically, metals at room temperature have ranging from 0.02 to 0.5.

====Discussion====
Since we disregard the change of area during deformation above, the true stress and strain curve should be re-derived. For deriving the stress strain curve, we can assume that the volume change is 0 even if we deformed the materials. We can assume that:

:formula_10

Then, the true stress can be expressed as below:

:formula_11

Additionally, the true strain can be expressed as below:

:formula_12

Then, we can express the value as

:formula_13

Thus, we can induce the plot in terms of formula_14 and formula_15 as right figure.

Additionally, based on the true stress-strain curve, we can estimate the region where necking starts to happen. Since necking starts to appear after ultimate tensile stress where the maximum force applied, we can express this situation as below:

:formula_16

so this form can be expressed as below:

:formula_17

It indicates that the necking starts to appear where reduction of area becomes much significant compared to the stress change. Then the stress will be localized to specific area where the necking appears.

Additionally, we can induce various relation based on true stress-strain curve.

1) True strain and stress curve can be expressed by the approximate linear relationship by taking a log on true stress and strain. The relation can be expressed as below:

:formula_18

Where formula_19 is stress coefficient and formula_20 is strain-hardening coefficient. Usually, the value of formula_20 has range around 0.02 to 0.5 at room temperature. If formula_20 is 1, we can express this material as perfect elastic material.

2) In reality, stress is also highly dependent on the rate of strain variation. Thus, we can induce the empirical equation based on the strain rate variation.

:formula_23

Where formula_24 is constant related to the material flow stress. formula_25 indicates the derivative of strain by the time, which is also known as strain rate. formula_26 is the strain-rate sensitivity. Moreover, value of formula_26 is related to the resistance toward the necking. Usually, the value of formula_26 is at the range of 0-0.1 at room temperature and as high as 0.8 when the temperature is increased.

By combining the 1) and 2), we can create the ultimate relation as below:

:formula_29

Where formula_30 is the global constant for relating strain, strain rate and stress.

3) Based on the true stress-strain curve and its derivative form, we can estimate the strain necessary to start necking. This can be calculated based on the intersection between true stress-strain curve as shown in right.

This figure also shows the dependency of the necking strain at different temperature. In case of FCC metals, both of the stress-strain curve at its derivative are highly dependent on temperature. Therefore, at higher temperature, necking starts to appear even under lower strain value.

All of these properties indicate the importance of calculating the true stress-strain curve for further analyzing the behavior of materials in sudden environment.

4) A graphical method, so-called &quot;Considere construction&quot;, can help determine the behavior of stress-strain curve whether necking or drawing happens on the sample. By setting formula_31as determinant, the true stress and strain can be expressed with engineering stress and strain as below:

:formula_32

Therefore, the value of engineering stress can be expressed by the secant line from made by true stress and formula_33 value where formula_34 to formula_35. By analyzing the shape of formula_36 diagram and secant line, we can determine whether the materials show drawing or necking.

On the figure (a), there is only concave upward Considere plot. It indicates that there is no yield drop so the material will be suffered from fracture before it yields. On the figure (b), there is specific point where the tangent matches with secant line at point where formula_37. After this value, the slope becomes smaller than the secant line where necking starts to appear. On the figure (c), there is point where yielding starts to appear but when formula_38, the drawing happens. After drawing, all the material will stretch and eventually show fracture. Between formula_39 and formula_40, the material itself does not stretch but rather, only the neck starts to stretch out.

==Misconceptions==
A popular misconception is that all materials that bend are &quot;weak&quot; and those that do not are &quot;strong&quot;. In reality, many materials that undergo large elastic and plastic deformations, such as steel, are able to absorb stresses that would cause brittle materials, such as glass, with minimal plastic deformation ranges, to break.

<doc id="237890" wikidata="Q552130" url="?curid=237890" title="Immanence">
<text>The doctrine or theory of immanence holds that the divine encompasses or is manifested in the material world. It is held by some philosophical and metaphysical theories of divine presence. Immanence is usually applied in monotheistic, pantheistic, pandeistic, or panentheistic faiths to suggest that the spiritual world permeates the . It is often contrasted with theories of transcendence, in which the divine is seen to be outside the material world.

Major faiths commonly devote significant philosophical efforts to explaining the relationship between immanence and transcendence but do so in different ways, such as:
* casting immanence as a characteristic of a transcendent God (common in Abrahamic religions), 
* subsuming immanent personal gods in a greater transcendent being (such as with Brahman in Hinduism), or
* approaching the question of transcendence as something which can only be answered through an appraisal of immanence.

== Western esotericism ==
Another meaning of immanence is the quality of being contained within, or remaining within the boundaries of a person, of the world, or of the mind. This meaning is more common within Christian and other monotheist theology, in which the one God is considered to transcend his creation. Pythagoreanism says that the &quot;nous&quot; is an intelligent principle of the world acting with a specific intention. This is the divine reason regarded in Neoplatonism as the first emanation of the divine. From the &quot;nous&quot; emerges the world soul, which gives rise to the manifest realm. Neoplatonic gnosticism goes on to say the Godhead is the Father, Mother, and Son (Zeus). In the mind of Zeus, the &quot;ideas&quot; are distinctly articulated and become the Logos by which he creates the world. These ideas become active in the Mind (&quot;nous&quot;) of Zeus. With him is the Power and from him is the &quot;nous&quot;. This theology further explains that Zeus is called Demiurge (&quot;Dêmiourgos&quot;, Creator), Maker (&quot;Poiêtês&quot;), and Craftsman (&quot;Technitês&quot;). The nous of the demiurge proceeds outward into manifestation, becoming living ideas. They give rise to a lineage of mortal human souls. The components of the soul are 1) the higher soul, seat of the intuitive mind (&quot;divine nous&quot;); 2) the rational soul (&quot;logistikon&quot;) (seat of discursive reason / &quot;dianoia&quot;); 3) the nonrational soul (&quot;alogia&quot;), responsible for the senses, appetites, and motion. Zeus thinks the articulated ideas (&quot;logos&quot;). The &quot;idea of ideas&quot; (&quot;eidos - eidôn&quot;), provides a model of the Paradigm of the Universe, which the Demiurge contemplates in his articulation of the &quot;ideas&quot; and his creation of the world according to the Logos.

== Buddhism ==

Tantric Buddhism and Dzogchen posit a non-dual basis for both experience and reality that could be considered an exposition of a philosophy of immanence that has a history on the subcontinent of India from early CE to the present. A paradoxical non-dual awareness or &quot;rigpa&quot; (Tibetan — &quot;vidya&quot; in Sanskrit) — is said to be the &#x27;self-perfected state&#x27; of all beings. Scholarly works differentiate these traditions from monism. The non-dual is said to be not immanent and not transcendent, not neither, nor both. One classical exposition is the Madhyamaka refutation of extremes that the philosopher-adept Nagarjuna propounded.

Exponents of this non-dual tradition emphasize the importance of a direct experience of non-duality through both meditative practice and philosophical investigation. In one version, one maintains awareness as thoughts arise and dissolve within the &#x27;field&#x27; of mind; one does not accept or reject them, rather one lets the mind wander as it will until a subtle sense of immanence dawns. &quot;Vipassana&quot;, or insight, is the integration of one&#x27;s &#x27;presence of awareness&#x27; with that which arises in the mind. Non-duality or &quot;rigpa&quot; is said to be the recognition that both the quiet, calm, abiding state as found in &quot;samatha&quot; and the movement or arising of phenomena as found in &quot;vipassana&quot; are not separate.

==Christianity==

=== Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Christianity ===

According to Christian theology, the transcendent God, who cannot be approached or seen in essence or being, becomes immanent primarily in the God-man Jesus the Christ, who is the incarnate Second Person of the Trinity. In Byzantine Rite theology the immanence of God is expressed as the hypostases or energies of God, who in his essence is incomprehensible and transcendent. In Catholic theology, Christ and the Holy Spirit immanently reveal themselves; God the Father only reveals himself immanently vicariously through the Son and Spirit, and the divine nature, the Godhead is wholly transcendent and unable to be comprehended.

This is expressed in St. Paul&#x27;s letter to the Philippians, where he writes:
The Holy Spirit is also expressed as an immanence of God.
The immanence of the triune God is celebrated in the Catholic Church, traditional Protestant Churches, and Eastern Churches during the liturgical feast of the Theophany of God, known in Western Christianity as the Epiphany.

Pope Pius X wrote at length about philosophical-theological controversies over immanence in his encyclical &quot;Pascendi dominici gregis&quot;.

=== Mormonism ===
According to Latter Day Saint theology, all of material creation is filled with immanence, known as the light of Christ. It is also responsible for the intuitive conscience born into man. The Light of Christ is the source of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment, and is the means by which God is in and through all things. LDS scriptures identify the divine Light with the mind of God, the source of all truth and conveyor of the characteristics of the divine nature through God&#x27;s goodness. The experienced brilliance of God reflects the “fullness” of this spirit within God&#x27;s being. Similarly, mankind can incorporate this spiritual light or divine mind and thus become one with God. This immanent spirit of light bridges the scientific and spiritual conceptualizations of the universe.

== Judaism ==

Traditional Jewish religious thought can be divided into &quot;Nigleh&quot; (&quot;Revealed&quot;) and &quot;Nistar&quot; (&quot;Hidden&quot;) dimensions. Hebrew Scripture is, in the Kabbalistic tradition, explained using the four level exegesis method of &quot;Pardes&quot;. In this system, the first three approaches, Simple, Hinted and Homiletical interpretations, characterise the revealed aspects. The fourth approach, the Secret meaning, characterises a hidden aspect. Among the classic texts of Jewish tradition, some Jewish Bible commentators, the &quot;Midrash&quot;, the &quot;Talmud&quot;, and mainstream Jewish philosophy use revealed approaches. Other Bible commentators, the Kabbalah, and Hasidic philosophy, use hidden approaches. Both dimensions are seen by adherents as united and complementary. In this way, ideas in Jewish thought are given a variety of ascending meanings. Explanations of a concept in &quot;Nigleh&quot; are given inherent, inner, mystical contexts from &quot;Nistar&quot;.

Descriptions of divine immanence can be seen in &quot;Nigleh&quot;, from the Bible to Rabbinic Judaism. In Genesis, God makes a personal covenant with the forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Daily Jewish prayers refer to this inherited closeness and personal relationship with the divine, for their descendants, as &quot;the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&quot;. To Moses, God reveals his Tetragrammaton name, that more fully captures divine descriptions of transcendence. Each of the Biblical names for God describe different divine manifestations. The most important prayer in Judaism, that forms part of the Scriptural narrative to Moses, says &quot;Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.&quot; This declaration combines different divine names, and themes of immanence and transcendence. Perhaps the most personal example of a Jewish prayer that combines both themes is the invocation repeatedly voiced during the time in the Jewish calendar devoted to &quot;Teshuva&quot; (Return, often inaccurately translated as Repentance), &quot;Avinu Malkeinu&quot; (&quot;Our Father, Our King&quot;). Much of the later Hebrew Biblical narrative recounts the reciprocal relationship and national drama of the unfolding of themes of immanence and transcendence. Kabbalistic, or Hasidic Jewish thought and philosophy describe and articulate these interconnected aspects of the divine-human relationship.

Jewish mysticism gives explanations of greater depth and spirituality to the interconnected aspects of God&#x27;s immanence and transcendence. The main expression of mysticism, the Kabbalah, began to be taught in 12th-Century Europe, and reached a new systemisation in 16th-Century Israel. The Kabbalah gives the full, subtle, traditional system of Jewish metaphysics. In the Medieval Kabbalah, new doctrines described the 10 &quot;Sephirot&quot; (divine emanations) through which the Infinite, unknowable divine essence reveals, emanates, and continuously creates existence. The Kabbalists identified the final, feminine &quot;Sefirah&quot; with the earlier, traditional Jewish concept of the &quot;Shekhinah&quot; (immanent divine presence). This gave great spirituality to earlier ideas in Jewish thought, such as the theological explanations of suffering (theodicy). In this example, the Kabbalists described the &quot;Shekhinah&quot; accompanying the children of Israel in their exile, being exiled alongside them, and yearning for Her redemption. Such a concept derives from the Kabbalistic theology that the physical World, and also the Upper spiritual Worlds, are continuously recreated from nothing by the &quot;Shefa&quot; (flow) of divine will, which emanates through the &quot;Sefirot&quot;. As a result, within all creations are divine sparks of vitality that sustain them. Medieval &quot;Kabbalah&quot; describes two forms of divine emanation, a &quot;light that fills all worlds&quot;, representing this immanent divine creative power, and a &quot;light that surrounds all worlds&quot;, representing transcendent expressions of Divinity.

The new doctrines of Isaac Luria in the 16th Century completed the Kabbalistic system of explanation. Lurianic Kabbalah describes the process of &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; (צמצום meaning &quot;Contraction&quot; or &quot;Constriction&quot;) in the Kabbalistic theory of creation, where God &quot;contracted&quot; his infinite essence in order to allow for a &quot;conceptual space&quot; in which a finite, independent world could exist. This has received different later interpretations in Jewish mysticism, from the literal to the metaphorical. In this process, creation unfolds within the divine reality. Luria offered a daring cosmic theology that explained the reasons for the &quot;Tzimtzum&quot;, the primordial catastrophe of &quot;Shevirat Hakelim&quot; (the &quot;Breaking of the Vessels&quot; of the &quot;Sefirot&quot; in the first existence), and the messianic &quot;Tikkun&quot; (&quot;Fixing&quot;) of this by every individual through their sanctification of physicality. The concept of &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; contains a built-in paradox, as it requires that God be simultaneously transcendent and immanent:

* On the one hand, if the Infinite did not &quot;restrict itself&quot;, then nothing could exist. There would be no limits, as the infinite essence of God, and also His primordial infinite light (Kabbalistic sources discuss God being able to reign alone, a revealed &#x27;light&#x27; of the &quot;Sefirah&quot; of Kingship, &quot;before&quot; creation) would comprise all reality. Any existence would be nullified into the divine infinity. Therefore, we could not have the variety of limited, finite things that comprise the creations in the universe that we inhabit. (The number of such creations could still be potentially limitless, if the physical universe, or Multiverse had no end). Because each limited thing results from a restriction of God&#x27;s completeness, God Himself must transcend (exist beyond) these various limited things. This idea can be interpreted in various ways. In its ultimate articulation, by the Hasidic leader Shneur Zalman of Liadi, in the intellectual Hasidic method of Chabad, the &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; is only metaphorical, an illusion from the perspective of man. Creation is panentheistic (taking place fully &quot;within God&quot;), and acosmic (Illusionary) from the divine perspective. God himself, and even his light, is unrestricted by &quot;Tzimtzum&quot;, from God&#x27;s perspective. The &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; is merely the hiding of this unchanged reality from creation. Shneur Zalman distinguishes between the &quot;Upper Level Unity&quot; of God&#x27;s existence from the divine perspective, with the &quot;Lower Level Unity&quot; of God&#x27;s existence as creation perceives him. Because God can be above logic, both perspectives of this paradox are true, from their alternative views. The dimension of the &quot;Tzimtzum&quot;, which implies divine transcendence, corresponds to the Upper Level Unity. In this perspective, because God is the true, ultimate infinity, then creation (even if its physical and spiritual realms should extend without limit) is completely nullified into literal non-existence by the divine. There is no change in the complete unity of God as all Reality, before or after creation. This is the ultimate level of divine transcendence.
* On the other hand, in Lurianic &quot;Kabbalah&quot;, the &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; has an immanent divine dimension. The &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; formed a &quot;space&quot; (in Lurianic terminology, the &quot;Halal&quot;, &quot;Vacuum&quot;) in which to allow creation to take place. The first act of creation was the emanation of a new light (&quot;Kav&quot;, &quot;Ray&quot;) into the vacated space, from the ultimate divine reality &quot;outside&quot;, or unaffected, by the space. The purpose of the &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; was that the vacated space allowed this new light to be suited to the needs and capacities of the new creations, without their being subsumed in the primordial divine infinity. Kabbalistic theology offers metaphysical explanations of how divine and spiritual processes unfold. In earlier, mainstream Jewish philosophy, logical descriptions of creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; (from nothing) describe the new existence of creation, compared to the preceding absence. &quot;Kabbalah&quot;, however, seeks to explain how the spiritual, metaphysical processes unfold. Therefore, in the Kabbalistic system, God is the ultimate reality, so that creation only exists because it is continuously sustained by the will of God. Creation is formed from the emanated &quot;light&quot; of the divine Will, as it unfolds through the later &quot;Sefirot&quot;. The light that originated with the &quot;Kav&quot; later underwent further contractions that diminished it, so that this immanent expression of Divinity could itself create the various levels of Spiritual, and ultimately, Physical existence. The terms of &quot;light&quot; and temporal descriptions of time are metaphorical, in a language accessible to grasp. In this immanent divine dimension, God continuously maintains the existence of, and is thus not absent from, the created universe. In Shneur Zalman&#x27;s explanation, this corresponds to the conscious perception by Creation of &quot;Lower Level Unity&quot; of God. In this perspective, Creation is real, and not an illusion, but is utterly nullified to the immanent divine life force that continuously sustains and recreates it. It may not perceive its complete dependence on Divinity, as in our present World, that feels its own existence as independent reality. However, this derives from the great concealments of Godliness in our present World. &quot;The Divine life-force which brings all creatures into existence must constantly be present within them ... were this life-force to forsake any created being for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation ...&quot;. (&quot;Tanya, Shaar Hayichud&quot;, Chapter 2–3. Shneur Zalman of Liadi).

== Continental philosophy ==
Giordano Bruno, Baruch Spinoza and possibly Hegel espoused philosophies of immanence versus philosophies of transcendence such as Thomism or Aristotelian tradition. Kant&#x27;s &quot;transcendental&quot; critique can be contrasted to Hegel&#x27;s &quot;immanent dialectics.&quot;

Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s idea of &quot;Natural Supernaturalism&quot; posited the immanence of the divine in nature, history and man. Clement Charles Julian Webb explained that &quot;Carlyle had done more than any other nineteenth-century writer to undermine belief in the transcendence of God and the origin of the material world in an act of creation in time, and to put in its place an &#x27;essentially immanentist&#x27; theology, drawn largely from the writings of the German Idealists.&quot; Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Natural Supernaturalism&quot; was highly influential on American Transcendentalism and British Idealism.

Giovanni Gentile&#x27;s actual idealism, sometimes called &quot;philosophy of immanence&quot; and the metaphysics of the &quot;I&quot;, &quot;affirms the organic synthesis of dialectical opposites that are immanent within actual or present awareness&quot;. His so-called method of immanence &quot;attempted to avoid: (1) the postulate of an independently existing world or a Kantian &quot;Ding-an-sich&quot; (thing-in-itself), and (2) the tendency of neo-Hegelian philosophy to lose the particular self in an Absolute that amounts to a kind of mystical reality without distinctions.&quot;

Political theorist Carl Schmitt used the term in his book &quot;Politische Theologie&quot; (1922), meaning a power within some thought, which makes it obvious for the people to accept it, without needing to claim being justified. The immanence of some political system or a part of it comes from the reigning contemporary definer of &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;, namely religion (or any similar system of beliefs, such as rationalistic or relativistic world-view). Many hold Schmitt to be interested in an immanent polity without anything transcendent involved in its vital operations beyond the very border that separates it from the &quot;enemy&quot; outside. As such he might have ironically secularized politics in a way that liberalism never could have. But this is a contentious issue. 

The French 20th-century philosopher Gilles Deleuze used the term immanence to refer to his &quot;empiricist philosophy&quot;, which was obliged to create action and results rather than establish transcendents. His final text was titled &quot;Pure Immanence: Essays on a Life&quot; and spoke of a plane of immanence.

Furthermore, the Russian Formalist film theorists perceived immanence as a specific method of discussing the limits of ability for a technological object. Specifically, this is the scope of potential uses of an object outside of the limits prescribed by culture or convention, and is instead simply the empirical spectrum of function for a technological artifact.

<doc id="237901" wikidata="Q2920215" url="?curid=237901" title="Finland's language strife">
<text>Finland&#x27;s language strife (; ) was a major conflict in mid-19th century Finland. Both the Swedish and Finnish languages were commonly used in Finland at the time, associated with descendants of Swedish colonisation and leading to class tensions among the speakers of the different languages. It became acute in the mid-19th century. 

== Background ==
Finland had once been under Swedish rule. Swedish (with some Latin) was the language of administration and education in the Swedish Realm. Swedish was therefore the most-used language of administration and higher education among the Finns. To gain higher education, one had to learn Swedish, and Finnish was considered by the upper classes to be a &quot;language of peasants&quot;. Immigration of Swedish peasants to Finland&#x27;s coastal regions also boosted the status of Swedish by sheer number of speakers. Although Mikael Agricola had started written Finnish with &quot;Abckiria&quot; in the 1500s, and a Finnish translation of the Civil Code of 1734 was published in 1759 (&quot;Ruotzin waldacunnan laki&quot;), it had no official status as a legal publication since the official language of administration was Swedish.

The rise to the ruling upper class usually required being Swedish-speaking, and therefore the language of some Finnish-speaking families changed completely to Swedish. In the Middle Ages, the majority in the Uusimaa region became Swedish-speaking. Only in the early decades of the 20th century did the Finnish language return to the majority language of Uusimaa.

As a result of the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia in 1809. Finland became the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire. Under Russian rule, the laws of the era when Finland was under Swedish rule remained largely unchanged, and Swedish continued to be used in administration.

The language strife became more acute in the second half of the 19th century. Johan Vilhelm Snellman, a Swede who wished to increase education in Finland, became a chief initiator of conflict in the 1850s due to his concern about the changing language use among the educated classes, many of whom were using Russian or Finnish. He wrote to Finnish author Zachris Topelius in 1860: &quot;My view is this: Whether Russian or Finnish will win, only God knows. I dare not hope for anything. But that Swedish will lose - that I do know.&quot; Elias Lönnrot compiled the first Finnish-Swedish dictionary (&quot;Finsk-Svenskt lexikon&quot;), completing it in 1880.

== Nationalism and the question of language ==
The rise of Fennomanic Finnish nationalism in the 19th century eventually led to the revived predominance of Finnish use in the country. A significant contribution to the Finnish national awakening from the mid-19th century onward came from the members of the mostly Swedish-speaking upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language. Snellman was himself an ethnic Swede and was later ennobled. These Finnish Swedes, known as the Fennomans, Fennicized their family names, learned Finnish, and made a point of using Finnish both in public and at home. However, another group of the Swedish-speaking population, the Svecomans, did not wish to abandon Swedish and opposed the Fennoman ideology and Fennoman-inspired reforms.

In 1863 Alexander II (AsK 26/1863) ruled that Finnish had an official language status comparable to that of Swedish; it could thereafter be used in an official capacity in legal and state office matters. Within a generation, the Finnish language use gained predominance in the government and the society of Finland.

During the Russification of Finland, Tsar Nicholas II attempted to change the official language to Russian (&quot;Language Manifesto of 1900&quot;), but Russification was halted by the general strike of 1905.

== After independence ==

After Finland gained independence in 1917, its relations with Sweden unexpectedly became strained in connection with the Finnish Civil War and the Åland crisis. These events aggravated the language dispute, and the controversy over Swedish and Finnish became a prominent feature of domestic politics during the 1920s and 1930s.

In the newly independent Finnish constitution of 1919, Finnish and Swedish were given equal status as national languages. The language strife thereafter centered on this and on the role of Swedish in universities, particularly regarding the number of professors who spoke and wrote in Swedish in their teaching. In the interwar period, the University of Helsinki was the scene of conflict between those who wanted to advance the use of Finnish and those who wished to maintain the use of Swedish. Geographer Väinö Tanner was one of the most vocal defenders of Swedish. A campaign initiated by the Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland collected 153,914 signatures in defense of Swedish in a petition that was presented to the parliament and government in October 1934. The conflict at the university generated an international reaction when academics from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland sent letters to the diplomatic representatives of Finland in their respective countries warning that diminishing the role of Swedish at the university would result in a weakening of Nordic unity.

The government issued a language decree on 1 January 1923 making Finnish and Swedish equal in status.

During the resettlement of more than 420,000 Karelian refugees after the Winter War against the Soviet Union (1939–1940), the Swedish-speaking minority feared that the new Finnish-speaking settlers would change the linguistic balance of their neighborhoods. Since the late 20th century, there has been discussion of whether the policy of mandatory Swedish classes in schools should continue.

<doc id="237903" wikidata="Q216174" url="?curid=237903" title="Rudy Boschwitz">
<text>Rudolph Ely “Rudy” Boschwitz (born November 7, 1930) is an American politician and businessman from the state of Minnesota. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the United States Senate from 1978 to 1991. From 1987 to 1989, Boschwitz served as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Boschwitz was born in Berlin to a Jewish family. When he was two years old, he and his family fled the country due to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. He grew up in New Rochelle, New York, and graduated with a Juris Doctor degree from New York University School of Law in 1953. Boschwitz moved to Minnesota, where he started a retail lumber store chain, Plywood Minnesota (later renamed Home Valu). He grew it into a successful business with 70 stores. Boschwitz became well-known for starring in Plywood Minnesota&#x27;s television commercials, wearing his signature plaid flannel shirts. Home Valu Interiors went out of business in May 2010.

Boschwitz first ran for elected office in Minnesota&#x27;s 1978 U.S. Senate election and defeated Democratic incumbent Wendell R. Anderson. He was reelected in 1984 by a landslide. From 1987 to 1989, he chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Boschwitz ran for reelection to a third term in the 1990 election against Democrat Paul Wellstone. He significantly outspent Wellstone and was expected to win, but lost in an upset. He was defeated again by Wellstone (who was re-elected) in a rematch in 1996. Boschwitz was later appointed to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights by President of the United States George W. Bush, and served on the commission from 2005 until 2006. Boschwitz is the oldest living person who served as an elected member of the U.S. Senate since the death of Daniel J. Evans.

==Early life and education==
Boschwitz was born November 7, 1930, in Berlin, Germany, the son of Lucy (née Dawidowicz) and Eli Boschwitz. In 1933, when he was two years old, his Jewish family fled Nazi Germany for the United States, settling in New Rochelle, New York, where he grew up. A graduate of The Pennington School, he attended Johns Hopkins University and graduated from the New York University Stern School of Business in 1950 and the New York University School of Law in 1953.

==Career==
Boschwitz was admitted to the New York State bar in 1954 and the Wisconsin bar in 1959. He served in the United States Army Signal Corps from 1954 to 1955, becoming a private first class. He was the founder and chairman of a plywood and home improvement retailer, Plywood Minnesota, which later became Home Valu Interiors. He returned to the company after his political career, and led it until it went out of business in May 2010.

Boschwitz was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in November 1978 and appointed on December 30, 1978, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Wendell R. Anderson, who was appointed to fill the seat after Walter Mondale was elected Vice President of the United States in 1976. Boschwitz was well known in Minnesota for operating a &quot;flavored milk&quot; booth at the Minnesota State Fair.

Boschwitz voted in favor of the Passage of Martin Luther King Jr. Day to establish Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President of the United States Ronald Reagan&#x27;s veto). He voted to confirm Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination, which failed when Robert Bork was not confirmed.

Boschwitz is known for one of the more interesting campaign buttons in Minnesota politics; the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party alleged that Boschwitz&#x27;s donors were &quot;fat cats&quot;, so Boschwitz&#x27;s campaign created a &quot;skinny cat&quot; campaign button to be worn by those who had donated less than $100 to his campaign.

After his 1990 defeat by Paul Wellstone, Boschwitz ran against Wellstone again in 1996 and lost again.

In 1991 he traveled to Ethiopia as the emissary of U.S. President George H. W. Bush. The negotiations Boschwitz led in Ethiopia resulted in Operation Solomon. Over 14,000 Jewish people were airlifted from Ethiopia to Israel. Operation Solomon took twice as many Beta Israel émigrés to Israel as Operation Moses and Operation Joshua combined.

Bosxhwitz was a top &quot;Bush Pioneer&quot; in 2000, raising $388,193, and a &quot;Bush Ranger&quot; in 2004, raising at least $200,000 for George W. Bush&#x27;s campaign fund in that election cycle.

In 2005, Bush named Boschwitz as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which met at the U.N. in Geneva.

== Later life ==
Boschwitz supported John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. He later served on the board of directors of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, was a board member of the AIPAC, and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Upon the death of Daniel J. Evans in September 2024, he became the oldest living person who was an elected member of the U.S. Senate.

== Personal life ==
Boschwitz married his wife, the former Ellen Antoinette Loewenstein, in 1956, and they had four sons, Gerry (died December 30, 2018), Kenneth, Daniel, and Thomas.

<text>William Alexander Smith (January 9, 1828 – May 16, 1888) was a U.S. Representative from the state of North Carolina.

Smith was born in Warren County, North Carolina and attended the common schools. He engaged in agricultural pursuits and was a member of the State constitutional convention in 1865 following the American Civil War. He was a member of the North Carolina State Senate in 1870. He was president of the North Carolina Railroad in 1868 and of the Yadkin River Railroad.

<text>Leopold von Ranke (21 December 1795 – 23 May 1886) was a German historian and a founder of modern source-based history. He was able to implement the seminar teaching method in his classroom and focused on archival research and the analysis of historical documents. Building on the methods of the Göttingen school of history, he was the first to establish a historical seminar. Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on primary sources (empiricism), an emphasis on narrative history and especially international politics (&quot;Außenpolitik&quot;). He was ennobled in 1865, with the addition of a &quot;von&quot; to his name.

Ranke also had a great influence on Western historiography and is considered a symbol of the quality of 19th century German historical studies. Ranke, influenced by Barthold Georg Niebuhr, was very talented in constructing narratives without exceeding the limits of historical evidence. His critics have noted the influence of Lutheranism in guiding his work, especially his belief that God&#x27;s actions were manifest in the lives of men and history, a viewpoint that shaped his ideas that the German Empire was a manifestation of God&#x27;s intent.

== Early life ==
Ranke was born in Wiehe, Thuringia, Saxony. Wiehe was then a part of the Electorate of Saxony. He came from a family of Lutheran pastors and lawyers. He was educated partly at home and partly in the high school at Schulpforta. His early years engendered a lifelong love of Ancient Greek, Latin and Lutheranism. In 1814, Ranke entered Leipzig University, where his subjects were Classics and Lutheran theology. At Leipzig, Ranke became an expert in philology and translation of the ancient authors into German. His teachers included Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann. As a student, Ranke&#x27;s favorite authors were Thucydides, Livy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Friedrich Schlegel. Ranke showed little interest in the work of modern history because of his dissatisfaction with what he regarded as history books that were merely a collection of facts lumped together by modern historians.

Between 1817 and 1825, Ranke worked as a schoolmaster teaching classics at the Friedrichs Gymnasium in Frankfurt an der Oder. During this time, he became interested in history in part because of his desire to be involved in the developing field of a more professionalized history and in part because of his desire to find the hand of God in the workings of history.

== Career ==
In 1824, Ranke launched his career with the book &quot;Geschichten der romanischen und germanischen Völker von 1494 bis 1514&quot; (&quot;Histories of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514&quot;) in which he used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age, including &quot;memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses&quot;. In that sense, he leaned on the traditions of philology but emphasized mundane documents instead of old and exotic literature.

After the minister of education was impressed with the work of a historian who did not have access to the nation&#x27;s great public libraries, Ranke was given a position in the University of Berlin, where he was a professor for nearly fifty years, starting in 1825. At the university, he used the seminar system and taught how to check the value of sources. Ranke became deeply involved in the dispute between the followers of the legal professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny, who emphasized the varieties of different periods of history, and the followers of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who saw history as the unfolding of a universal story. Ranke supported Savigny and criticized the Hegelian view of history as being a one-size-fits-all approach. Also during his time in Berlin, Ranke became the first historian to use the forty-seven volumes that comprised the diplomatic archives of Venice from the 16th and 17th centuries. Since many archives opened up during this time, he sent out his students to these places to recruit information. In his classrooms, he would discuss the sources that his students would find and would emphasize that history should be told &quot;the way it happened&quot;. Therefore, he is often seen as &quot;the pioneer of a critical historical science&quot;. Meanwhile, Ranke came to prefer dealing with primary sources as opposed to secondary sources.

It was in Vienna where the friendship of Friedrich von Gentz and the protection of Klemens von Metternich opened to him the Venetian Archives, a fresh source, the value of which he first discovered; it is still not exhausted. He found time to write a short book entitled &quot;Die Serbische Revolution&quot; (1829) from material supplied to him by Vuk Karadžić, a Serb who had himself been witness to the scenes he related during the First Serbian Uprising in 1804. This was afterwards expanded into &quot;Serbien und die Turkei im 19 Jahrhundert&quot; (1879).

At the behest of the Prussian government, Ranke founded and edited the &quot;Historische-Politische Zeitschrift&quot; journal from 1832 to 1836. Ranke, who was a conservative, used the journal to attack the ideas of liberalism. In his 1833 article &quot;The Great Powers&quot; and his 1836 article &quot;Dialogue on Politics&quot;, Ranke claimed that every state is given a special moral character from God and individuals should strive best to fulfill the &quot;idea&quot; of their state. Thus, in this way, Ranke urged his readers to stay loyal to the Prussian state and to reject the ideas of the French Revolution, which Ranke claimed were meant for France only.

From 1834 to 1836, Ranke published &quot;Die römischen Päpste, ihre Kirche und ihr Staat im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert&quot; (&quot;The Popes of Rome, Their Church and State in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries&quot;) (3 vols.). As a Protestant, Ranke was barred from viewing the Vatican Secret Archive in Rome, but based on private papers in Rome and Venice, he was able to explain the history of the papacy in the 16th century. In this book, Ranke coined the term &quot;Counter-Reformation&quot; and offered colorful portrayals of Pope Paul IV, Ignatius of Loyola and Pope Pius V. He promoted research into primary sources: &quot;&quot;I see the time approaching when we shall base modern history, no longer on the reports even of contemporary historians, except insofar as they had personal and immediate knowledge of facts; and still less on work yet more remote from the source; but rather on the narratives of eyewitnesses, and on genuine and original documents&quot;.

The papacy denounced Ranke&#x27;s book as anti-Catholic. In contrast, many Protestants denounced it as not anti-Catholic enough. Still, historians have generally praised him for placing the situation of the Catholic Church in the context of the 16th century and for his fair treatment of the complex interaction of the political and religious issues in that century. The British Catholic historian Lord Acton defended Ranke&#x27;s book as the most fair-minded, balanced and objective study ever written on the papacy of the 16th century.

In 1841, his fame in its ascendancy, Ranke was appointed Historiographer Royal to the Prussian court. In 1845, he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In Paris, Ranke met the Irish woman Clarissa Helena Graves (born 1808) from Dublin in July 1843. She had been educated in England and the Continent. They were engaged on 1 October and married in Bowness, England in a ceremony officiated by her brother Robert Perceval Graves, an Anglican priest. They had three sons (one of whom died in infancy), and one daughter.

From 1847 to 1848, Ranke published &quot;Neun Bücher preußischer Geschichte&quot; (translated as &quot;Memoirs of the House of Brandenburg and History of Prussia, during the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries&quot;) in which he examined the fortunes of the Hohenzollern family and state from the Middle Ages to the reign of Frederick the Great. Many Prussian nationalists were offended by Ranke&#x27;s portrayal of Prussia as a typical medium-sized German state rather than as a great power. 

From 1852 to 1861, Ranke published &quot;French History Mainly in the 16th and 17th Centuries&quot; (5 vols.), covering Francis I to Louis XIV and gaining him more praise for his impartiality despite being German.

In a series of lectures given before future King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1854, Ranke argued that &quot;every age is next to God&quot;, by which he meant that every period of history is unique and must be understood in its own context. He argued that God gazes over history in its totality and finds all periods equal. Ranke rejected the teleological approach to history, by which each period is considered inferior to the following period. Thus, the Middle Ages were not inferior to the Renaissance, simply different. In Ranke&#x27;s view, historians had to understand a period and its terms and seek to find only the general ideas that animated every period of history. For Ranke, history was not to be an account of man&#x27;s &quot;progress&quot; because &quot;[a]fter Plato, there can be no more Plato&quot;. Ultimately, &quot;[h]istory is no criminal court&quot;.

For Ranke, Christianity was morally most superior and could not be improved upon. When he wrote &quot;Zur orientalischen Frage. Gutachten&quot; at the behest of the Kaiser he framed the conflict with the Ottoman Empire as primarily religious; the civil rights of Christians against Muslims in the Ottoman Empire could only be secured by the intervention of the Christian European nations.

From 1854 to 1857, Ranke published &quot;History of the Reformation in Germany&quot; (&quot;Deutsche Geschichte im Zeitalter der Reformation&quot;), using the ninety-six volumes of correspondence from ambassadors to the Imperial Diet he found in Frankfurt to explain the Reformation in Germany as the result of both politics and religion.

From 1859 to 1867, Ranke published the six-volume &quot;History of England Principally in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries&quot; (&quot;Englische Geschichte vornehmlich im XVI and XVII Jahrhundert&quot;), followed by an expanded nine-volume edition from 1870 to 1884, which extended his huge reach even farther. At this point, he was eighty years old, and devoted the rest of his career to shorter treatises on German history that supplement his earlier writings.

== Later life ==

The honors poured in when Ranke was ennobled in 1865, appointed a Prussian Privy Councillor in 1882 and given an honorary citizenship of Berlin in 1885. In 1884, he was appointed the first honorary member of the American Historical Association. In 1885, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. After his retirement in 1871, Ranke continued to write on a variety of subjects relating to German history such as the French Revolutionary Wars, Albrecht von Wallenstein, Karl August von Hardenberg, and King Frederick William IV of Prussia. In 1880, Ranke began a huge six-volume work on world history which began with ancient Egypt and the Israelites. By the time of his death in Berlin in 1886 at the age of 90, Ranke had reached only the 12th century, but his assistants later used his notes to take the series up to 1453.
After his wife died in 1871, Ranke became half-blind, depending on assistants to read to him. A diary entry from January 1877 contains his mature thoughts about being a historian:

The proverb tells us that poets are born. Not only in the arts, but even in some scholarly fields, young men develop into full bloom, or at least display their originality. Musicians and mathematicians have the expectation of attaining eminence in early years. But a historian must be old, not only because of the immeasurable extent of his field of study, but because of the insight into the historical process which a long life confers, especially under changing conditions. It would hardly be bearable for him to have only a short span of experience. For his personal development requires that great events complete their course before his eyes, that others collapse, that new forms be attempted.

After Ranke&#x27;s death, Syracuse University purchased his collection. The Ranke Library of 25,000 books and other materials was ten times as large as the university&#x27;s own.

== Methodology and criticism ==
At the core of his method, Ranke did not believe that general theories could cut across time and space. Instead, he made statements about the time using quotations from primary sources, saying: &quot;My understanding of &#x27;leading ideas&#x27; is simply that they are the dominant tendencies in each century. However, these tendencies can only be described; they can not, in the last resort, be summed up in a concept&quot;. Ranke objected to philosophy of history, particularly as practiced by Hegel, claiming that Hegel ignored the role of human agency in history which was too essential to be &quot;characterized through only one idea or one word&quot; or &quot;circumscribed by a concept&quot;. This lack of emphasis on unifying theories or themes led Rudolf Haym to denigrate his ideas as &quot;the mindlessness of the empiricist&quot;. In the 19th century, Ranke&#x27;s work was very popular and his ideas about historical practice gradually became dominant in western historiography. However, he had critics among his contemporaries, including Karl Marx, a former Hegelian, who suggested that Ranke engaged in some of the practices he criticized in other historians.

Ranke began his first book with the statement in the introduction that he would show the unity of the experiences of the &quot;Teutonic&quot; nations of Scandinavia, England and Germany and the &quot;Latin&quot; nations of Italy, Spain and France through the great &quot;respirations&quot; of the &quot;Völkerwanderung&quot; (great migration), the Crusades and colonization that in Ranke&#x27;s view bound all of the nations together to produce modern European civilization. Despite his opening statement, Ranke largely treated all of the nations under examination separately until the outbreak of the wars for the control of Italy starting in 1494. However, the book is best remembered for Ranke&#x27;s comment: &quot;To history has been assigned the office of judging the past, of instructing the present for the benefit of future ages. To such high offices this work does not aspire: It wants only to show what actually happened ()&quot;. Ranke&#x27;s statement that history should embrace the principle of (meaning &quot;how things actually were&quot;) was subsequently taken by many historians as their guiding principle. There has been much debate over the precise meaning of this phrase. Some have argued that adhering to the principle of means that the historian should document facts, but not offer any interpretation of these facts. Following Georg Iggers, Peter Novick has argued that Ranke, who was more of a romantic and idealist than his American contemporaries understood, meant instead that the historian should discover the facts and find the essences behind them. Under this view, the word &quot;eigentlich&quot; should be translated as &quot;essentially&quot;, the aim then being to &quot;show what essentially happened&quot;. Ranke went on to write that the historian must seek the &quot;Holy hieroglyph&quot; that is God&#x27;s hand in history, keeping an &quot;eye for the universal&quot; whilst taking &quot;pleasure in the particular&quot;.

While Ranke&#x27;s methods remain influential in the practice of history, his broader ideas of historiography and empiricism are now regarded by some as outdated and no longer credible. They held sway among historians until the mid-20th century, when they were challenged by E. H. Carr and Fernand Braudel. Carr opposed Ranke&#x27;s ideas of empiricism as naive, boring and outmoded, saying that historians did not merely report facts; they choose which facts they use. Braudel&#x27;s approach was based on the &quot;histoire problème&quot;. Remarking on the legacy of Ranke&#x27;s dictum that historians should represent the past (&quot;as it actually was&quot;), Walter Benjamin scathingly wrote that it represented &quot;the strongest narcotic of the [19th] century&quot;.

<text>Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes living and fossil sturgeons and paddlefishes (Acipenseroidei), as well as the extinct families Chondrosteidae and Peipiaosteidae. They are the second earliest diverging group of living ray-finned fish after the bichirs. Despite being early diverging, they are highly derived, having only weakly ossified skeletons that are mostly made of cartilage, and in modern representatives highly modified skulls.

== Description ==
The axial skeleton of Acipenseriformes is only partially ossified, with the majority of the bones being replaced with cartilage. The notochord, usually only found in fish embryos, is unconstricted and retained throughout life. The premaxilla and maxilla bones of the skull present in other vertebrates have been lost. While larvae and early juvenile acipenseriforms have teeth, the adults are toothless, or nearly so. The infraorbital nerve is carried by a series of separate canals, rather than being within the circumorbital bones. The palatoquadrate bones of the skull possess a cartilaginous symphysis (joint), and also have a broad autopalatine plate, as well as a narrow palatoquadrate bridge, and a quadrate flange. The quadratojugal bone is three-pointed (triradiate), and the dentition on the gill-arch is confined to the upper part of the first arch and to only the first and second hypobranchials. Members of Acipenseriformes retain the ability to sense electric fields (electroreception) using structures called ampullae. This ability was present in the last common ancestor of all living jawed fish, but was lost in the ancestor of neopterygian fish. All acipenseriforms probably possessed barbels like modern sturgeon (which have four) and paddlefish (which have two).

== Evolutionary history ==
Acipenseriforms are assumed to have evolved from a &quot;palaeoniscoid&quot; ancestor. Their closest relatives within the &quot;palaeoniscoids&quot; are uncertain and contested. The ancestors of Acipenseriformes are thought to have split from those of other living fish around the Carboniferous period (360–300 million years ago). The last common ancestor of Acipenseriformes underwent a whole genome duplication event suggested to have occurred around 242–255 million years ago, with the genome subsequently undergoing rediploidization, both before the split between sturgeons and paddlefish, and separately in both lineages after the split. 

&quot;Eochondrosteus&quot; from the Early Triassic (252–247 million years ago) of China has been suggested by some authors to be the oldest acipenseriform. The oldest unambiguous members of the order are the Chondrosteidae, a group of large fish found in marine deposits from the Early Jurassic (201–175 million years ago) of Europe, which already have reduced ossification of the skeleton. The Peipiaosteidae are known from Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous freshwater deposits in Asia. The estimated time of the divergence between sturgeons and paddlefish varies. An estimate based on 30 protein-encoding nuclear markers suggest 204.1 million years ago, research on mitochondrial genomes suggest 155.2 million years ago, and Bayesian dating based on the combined matrix of molecular (mitogenomes) and morphological characters set the divergence to 162 (195–137) million years ago.

The oldest known paddlefish is &quot;Protopsephurus&quot; from the Early Cretaceous of China around 120 million years ago, while the earliest known sturgeons appear in the Late Cretaceous in North America and Asia, around 100–95 million years ago.

==Conservation==
Most living species of Acipenseriformes are classified as threatened (mostly endangered or critically endangered) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The Chinese paddlefish was last seen alive in 2003, and was considered to have gone extinct sometime between 2005 and 2010 by the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute in their 2019 report.

== Hybridization ==
A study published in 2020 reported a successful hybridization between a Russian sturgeon (&quot;Acipenser gueldenstaedtii&quot;) and an American paddlefish (&quot;Polyodon spathula&quot;), indicating that the two species can breed with one another despite their lineages having been separated for hundreds of millions of years. This has marked the first successful hybridization between members of Acipenseridae and Polyodontidae.

<text>De Wallen () is the largest and best known red-light district in Amsterdam. It consists of a network of alleys containing approximately 300 one-room cabins rented by prostitutes who offer their sexual services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights and blacklight. Window prostitution is the most visible and typical kind of red-light district sex work in Amsterdam.

De Wallen, together with prostitution areas &quot;Singelgebied&quot; and &quot;Ruysdaelkade&quot;, form the &quot;Rosse Buurt&quot; (red-light areas) of Amsterdam. Of these De Wallen is the oldest and largest area. It is one of the city&#x27;s major tourist attractions. Thursday through Sunday access to De Wallen is restricted at 1:00 am, with bars and restaurants closing at 2:00 am and brothels at 3:00 am.

The area also has a number of sex shops, sex theatres, peep shows, a sex museum, a cannabis museum, and a number of coffeeshops that sell cannabis.

==History==
The Rokin and Damrak run along the original course of the river Amstel. These two roads meet in Dam Square which marks the spot where a bridge was built across the river in 1270. It had doors which were used to dam the river at certain times to avoid flooding. The Damrak then became a harbor and it was around this area that the red-light district first appeared. The walled canals led to the names &quot;De Wallen&quot; and &quot;Walletjes&quot; (little walls).

Historically because of proximity to the harbor the area has attracted both prostitution and migrant populations and these are the features it is best known for today.

From late medieval times, the trade started to be restricted. Married men and priests were forbidden to enter the area. In 1578 during the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule a Protestant city board was formed with fornication deemed punishable. Sex workers were banned and forced underground. They would work for a madam who provided room and board, protection and advice. Often the madam and girls would venture out at night visiting pubs and inns to pick up clients. Parlours remained illegal but tolerated if kept hidden. Trade remained small-scale though spread across the city. Well-known areas were De Haarlemmerdijk, De Houttuinen, Zeedijk and around the harbor.

In the 18th century, wealthy men would meet prostitutes at gambling houses on De Gelderskade and Zeedijk. The women would then take the men back to the parlors where they came from. However, these were often unappealing to a gentleman of means. A solution to this problem was for the gambling houses to provide board for the women. This suited everyone including the authorities. The gambling houses invested in luxury furnishings and gradually they became brothels employing up to 30 women. Famous brothels included De Pijl in Pijlstraat, De Fonteyn in Nieuwmarkt and Madame Therese on the Prinsengracht. For those who could not afford entry to these houses, there were still women to be found around Oudekerksplein and unofficial policies of tolerance remained, although prostitution was technically illegal.

In 1811 the ban on prostitution was lifted. In this Napoleonic era, men from the French Imperial Naval Corps were the main clients for prostitutes in De Wallen. Regulation was introduced and there were compulsory health checks to protect soldiers from venereal diseases. They were given a red card which was a permit to work. If found to be infected the card was taken until they could prove they were disease free. Because there was no reliable treatment for syphilis at this time this led to dangerous treatments such as mercury baths to ease symptoms.

In the early 20th century religious organizations ran campaigns to try to end prostitution. In 1911 a law was passed banning brothels and pimping, but prostitution was not outlawed. Once again it was driven underground and tolerated as long it did not cause a disturbance. With the closure of many parlors in De Wallen some women moved to De Pijp. In 1935 it was estimated that there were around 150 disguised parlors. Fronts included massage, pedicure, manicure, and beauty treatments. Sex workers continued to work around the Oudekerksplein. Instead of being visible as they are today they would stand behind closed curtains and peer through a small crack looking for customers. If they stood in the doorway they would be arrested.

==Location==
The total area is approximately , limited by the Niezel in the north, the sea dike/Nieuwmarkt in the east, the Sint Jansstraat in the south and the Warmoesstraat in the west. Prostitution takes place within this area in the following streets: Barndesteeg, Bethlehemsteeg, Bloedstraat, Boomsteeg (now closed), Dollebegijnensteeg, Enge Kerksteeg, Goldbergersteeg, Gordijnensteeg, Molensteeg, Monnikenstraat, Oudekerksplein, Oudekennissteeg, Oudezijds Achterburgwal, Oudezijds Voorburgwal, Sint Annendwarsstraat, Sint Annenstraat, Stoofsteeg, and Trompettersteeg.

Between Sint Jansstraat and Sint Annenstraat and running parallel to them are Leidekkerssteeg, Gooijersteeg, Blaauwlakensteeg, and Zwartlakensteeg. At least three of these had red light windows which were closed in the 1970s. Today these alleys are blocked by locked gates although the remains of some bricked over windows can be seen in the architecture. In the 1990s Slapersteeg was also closed and a gate now blocks the alley.

In the 1990s parts of Sint Annenstraat and Sint Annendwarsstraat were demolished. The rooms in Goldbergersteeg were opened after this time.

==Sex work==

Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, with the exception of street prostitution, but work permits are not issued in the form of a green card for prostitution; therefore legally working in the trade is limited mostly to EU citizens or foreign permanent residents. A non-EU citizen can work legally in the Netherlands without a work permit in certain circumstances, for instance, if they are the spouse of a local citizen. From January 2013 the legal working age of a prostitute in the Netherlands was raised from 18 to 21.

There is no compulsory requirement for sex workers to undergo sexually transmitted disease (STD) or HIV testing in the Netherlands. Some brothels and clubs have their sex workers screened at a regular basis, but no formal guidelines exist. Brothel owners and room operators often require health certificates such as the SERVSAFE test before employing or leasing rooms.

To counter negative publicity, Mariska Majoor, founder of the Prostitution Information Center, organized two &quot;open days&quot; in February 2006 and March 2007, allowing visitors access to some window brothels and peep shows and informing them about the working conditions there. Majoor was also instrumental in having the world&#x27;s first monument to sex workers installed in the red light district. The bronze statue was unveiled on the &quot;Oudekerksplein&quot; in front of the Oude Kerk at the open day in March 2007 and shows a woman standing in a doorway.

===Red lights and blue lights===

In De Wallen, female sex workers illuminate their windows with red lights, while transgender women sex workers use blue lights. This is to help customers differentiate between the two. Bloedstraat, a street in De Wallen, has numerous transgender women working in it using blue lights.

Men cannot be found in the red light district at all. Instead, they offer their services in parks or gay clubs or through various sex-related websites. These are called &quot;paydates&quot; &amp; refer to websites such as &quot;bullchat.nl&quot; and &quot;chatboy.nl&quot;. Men are not referred to as prostitutes, as only women can use this term.

There is one day, however, in recent years where men have been showcased in windows to promote equality. They have notoriously done this on August 3, the day that coincides with Amsterdam&#x27;s pride celebration. Men are in the window for the day not to actually work in any way other than model, but to raise awareness for the Red Light District&#x27;s lack of male and gay representation, as the vast majority of its sex workers are cisgender, straight women.

The police close down several male brothels each year, so it is difficult to determine how many still operate in the country. However, there is only one legal brothel still in use, called &quot;Club 21&quot;.

==Cannabis &quot;coffeeshops&quot;==
Cannabis &quot;coffeeshops&quot; in the RLD and elsewhere in the Netherlands are licensed to sell cannabis and serve soft drinks. Some may serve small packaged food, or even whole meals infused with cannabis. The sale of tobacco on its own is not permitted, but many offer pre-rolled joints filled with a mix of cannabis and tobacco. Alcoholic beverages are not permitted inside of coffeeshops.

Before the onset of &quot;coffeeshop&quot; licensing, some began openly selling cannabis. The first coffee shops opened in the 1970s. These faced trouble from police and the local councils with frequent closures. In 1976, the government of the Netherlands began to take steps to decriminalize the use and possession of cannabis by changing the law so that possession of up to 30 grams (1 oz) of cannabis was no longer a criminal offense.

The &quot;gedoogbeleid&quot; or tolerance policy gave rise to &quot;coffeeshop&quot; licensing which meant that as long as &quot;coffeeshops&quot; did not sell hard drugs, they were allowed to operate. &quot;Coffeeshops&quot; were not allowed to operate in certain cities near the borders of Germany and Belgium because it was felt soft drug use might raise crime there.

The government of Netherlands has continually been under pressure from different western countries to rein in &quot;coffeeshops&quot;, leading to several &quot;coffeeshops&quot; being shut down for flouting rules, with no licenses issued to new operators. This approach has continued since 1995. In the 1990s, the &quot;coffeeshop&quot; owners organized themselves into a union, the Bond van cannabis Detaillisten or BCD, set up to represent the interests of the &quot;coffeeshops&quot; which were under constant pressure from local councils.

A recent policy meant that 26 &quot;coffeeshops&quot; in the De Wallen area had to close their doors between 1 September 2012 and 31 August 2015.

==Abuses, human rights and tourism nuisance==

Netherlands has been listed by a report of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime as a top destination for victims of human trafficking:

According to Job Cohen, the former mayor of Amsterdam, &quot;We&#x27;ve realized this is no longer about small-scale entrepreneurs, but those big crime organizations are involved here in trafficking women, drugs, killings, and other criminal activities&quot;.

Groups of sex workers have also worked to raise awareness of their rights. The Prostitute Information Centre, founded in the 1990s, is a prostitute-led organisation offering tours of the area and information concerning safety and the rights of the people involved. While sex workers in brothels currently have to register, it has been suggested making escorts and kamer workers register, which has been opposed by some sex worker groups out of concern it would favor pimps over the workers themselves. Jan Fisher of Red Thread commented: &quot;The ones who want to work know how devastating the stigma could be, and will be. They will try to work outside this system and they&#x27;ll be vulnerable when they&#x27;re detected by the police and tax office, and the ones who are trafficked may be forced by their pimps to register so they have a kind of legal status.&quot;

In 2007 a statue called &quot;Belle&quot; was unveiled on the Oudekerksplein with the inscription &quot;Respect sex workers all over the world&quot;.

About 75% of Amsterdam&#x27;s prostitutes are from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia, according to a former prostitute who produced a report about the sex trade.

European citizens of the 27 member EU states have the legal right under internal market to employment in the Netherlands in any work. Citizens of other countries must already have a valid residence permit (not visitor visa) to work legally in the sex trade as work permits are not issued for the jobs.

TAMPEP research into the origin of migrant sex workers records 60% of workers in the Netherlands are foreign-born, with the highest proportion of these (43%) from elsewhere in Europe. This represents a decrease from 70% migrants in sex work as recorded in 2006. The report cites high internal mobility within the EU as the reason for this decrease.

In 2004, Amsterdam authorities commissioned research into pimping and human trafficking in Amsterdam. The Willem Plompe institution took up that job. The researchers, under the leadership of professor Frank Bovenkerk, found that women under the control of a pimp can be easily put to work in the legal brothels with the brothel owners being aware that the women are controlled by pimps. The general setup of window prostitution was said to be helpful to pimps, as it facilitates the direct control of the women by their pimp.

A Christian organization of aid workers named the &#x27;Scharlaken Koord&#x27; (in English, &quot;Scarlet Cord&quot;) has set up a special &#x27;pal&#x27;-program for prostitutes in which the pals help the women build a new social network.

In September 2007, the city council of Amsterdam at the behest of mayor Job Cohen, concerned about trafficking and pimping in the area, forced the owner Charlie Geerts to close 51 prostitution windows, reducing the total number of windows in De Wallen by a third. Amsterdam authorities bought 18 properties from Geerts, with the aim of developing the area with fashion designers and other upscale businesses.

Mariska Majoor of the Prostitution Information Center and representatives of the sex worker rights group De Rode Draad have decried the decision, claiming it would not reduce crime but would only lead to higher rent and more competition for the remaining windows.

In January 2008, the city council announced plans to close the Rosso live sex theatre and the &quot;Banana bar&quot; strip club in the area. Local business owners have formed the group &quot;Platform 1012&quot; (named after the zipcode of the area) to oppose the efforts of the Amsterdam government. In the end, the actions of the city government resulted in the closure of the Yab Yum brothel.

At the end of 2008, mayor Job Cohen announced plans to close half of the city&#x27;s 400 prostitution windows because of suspected criminal gang activity; part of the city&#x27;s 70 cannabis cafes and sex clubs will also be closed. Mayor Job Cohen: &quot;It is not that we want to get rid of our red-light district. We want to reduce it. Things have become unbalanced and if we do not act we will never regain control&quot;.

In 2009, the Dutch justice ministry announced plans to close 320 prostitution &quot;windows&quot; from Amsterdam.

Karina Schaapman, a former Amsterdam prostitute who is now a city councilor said: &quot;There are people who are really proud of the red light district as a tourist attraction. It&#x27;s supposed to be such a wonderful, cheery place that shows just what a free city we are. But I think it&#x27;s a cesspit. There&#x27;s a lot of serious criminality. There&#x27;s a lot of exploitation of women, and a lot of social distress. That&#x27;s nothing to be proud of.&quot;

But in 2013 Metje Blaak, who worked in the sex trade for 25 years before turning to filmmaking, says closing legal brothels will push women out onto the streets. &quot;In the window is safe, open. You can see your clients. You can see everything,&quot; she says.

===2019===
In July 2019, more than ten years after Asscher&#x27;s efforts to bring change to the Red Light District, new mayor Femke Halsema announced a different approach.

She proposed several different options for residents, sex workers, business owners and everyone else involved. A report called &quot;The Future of Window Prostitution in Amsterdam&quot; outlined four changes to the district that would become under serious consideration. &quot;We must dare to think big – also about ending prostitution in the Red Light District&quot;, said Mayor Femke Halsema. &quot;Unacceptable situations have arisen, and the council is ready to consider far-reaching solutions.&quot;

The Red Light District, in general, has been controversial since its existence. The internal struggles have differed from the desire to increase inclusion &amp; LGBTQ+ influence into the district &amp; therefore promote safe sex work for all types of people &amp; all types of identities, to those who want to end sex work in general. Some argue that sex work is the reason for Amsterdam&#x27;s rising sex trafficking issues. According to a 2019 article representing this problem, no one is aware just how many women are in the industry, and it is described as a &quot;&#x27;dark number.&quot;&#x27; They also say that many of these girls are doing so against their will: &quot;Some researchers say 4,000, others say 8,000. Some say 10% are trafficked, others say 90%. Even with that lowest figure, 400 girls are selling sex against their will.&quot; It raises questions about whether or not it is a positive idea to try to bring different types of people into an industry that keeps a lot in the dark.

<text>Paddlefish (family Polyodontidae) are a family of ray-finned fish belonging to order Acipenseriformes, and one of two living groups of the order alongside sturgeons (Acipenseridae). They are distinguished from other fish by their elongated rostra, which are thought to enhance electroreception to detect prey. Paddlefish have been referred to as &quot;primitive fish&quot; because the Acipenseriformes are among the earliest diverging lineages of ray-finned fish, having diverged from all other living groups over 300 million years ago. Both living and fossil paddlefish are found almost exclusively in North America and China.

Eight species are known: Six of those species are extinct, and known only from fossils (five from North America, one from China), one of the extant species, the American paddlefish (&quot;Polyodon spathula&quot;), is native to the Mississippi River basin in the U.S. The other is the Chinese paddlefish (&quot;Psephurus gladius&quot;), which was declared extinct in 2022 following a 2019 recommendation; the species has not been sighted in the Yangtze River Basin in China since 2003. Chinese paddlefish are also commonly referred to as &quot;Chinese swordfish&quot;, or &quot;elephant fish&quot;. The earliest known paddlefish is &quot;Protopsephurus&quot;, from the early Cretaceous (Aptian) of China, dating to around 120 million years ago.

Paddlefish populations have declined dramatically throughout their historic range as a result of overfishing, pollution, and the encroachment of human development, including the construction of dams that have blocked their seasonal upward migration to ancestral spawning grounds. Other detrimental effects include alterations of rivers which have changed natural flows resulting in the loss of spawning habitat and nursery areas.

== Morphology ==

Paddlefish as a group are one of the few organisms that retain a notochord past the embryonic stage. Paddlefish have very few bones and their bodies mostly consist of cartilage with the notochord functioning as a soft spine. During the initial stages of development from embryo to fry, paddlefish have no rostrum (snout). It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum of the Chinese paddlefish was narrow and sword-like whereas the rostrum of the American paddlefish is broad and paddle-like. Some common morphological characteristics of paddlefish include a spindle-shaped, smooth-skinned scaleless body, heterocercal tail, and small poorly developed eyes. Unlike the filter-feeding American paddlefish, Chinese paddlefish were piscivores, and highly predatory. Their jaws were more forward pointing which suggested they foraged primarily on small fishes in the water column, and occasionally on shrimp, benthic fishes, and crabs. The jaws of the American paddlefish are distinctly adapted for filter feeding only. They are ram suspension filter feeders with a diet that consists primarily of zooplankton, and occasionally small insects, insect larvae, and small fish.

The largest Chinese paddlefish on record measured in length, and was estimated to weigh a few thousand pounds. They commonly reached and . Although the American paddlefish is one of the largest freshwater fishes in North America, their recorded lengths and weights fell short in comparison to the larger Chinese paddlefish. American paddlefish commonly reach or more in length and can weigh more than . The largest American paddlefish on record was caught in 1916 in Okoboji Lake, Iowa. The fish was taken with a spear, and measured long and in the girth. A report published by J.R. Harlan and E.B. Speaker (1969) in &quot;Iowa Fish and Fishing&quot; states that the fish weighed over . The world record paddlefish caught on rod and reel weighed and was long. The fish was caught by Clinton Boldridge in a 5 acre pond in Atchison County, Kansas on 5 May 2004. However, the record would be broken an additional two times in 2020: On 28 June 2020, an Oklahoma man caught a 146 pound paddlefish in Keystone Lake, west of Tulsa. Later on 23 July 2020, the record was broken again when another Oklahoma man caught a 151 pound, nearly 6 foot long paddlefish in the same lake.

Scientists once believed paddlefish used their rostrums to excavate bottom substrate, but have since determined with the aid of electron microscopy that paddlefish rostrums are covered in electroreceptors called ampullae. These ampullae are densely packed within star-shaped bone projections that branch out from the rostrum. The electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields which not only signal the presence of prey items in the water column, such as zooplankton which is the primary diet of the American paddlefish, but they can also detect the individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton&#x27;s appendages. Paddlefish have poorly developed eyes, and rely on their electroreceptors for foraging. However, the rostrum is not the paddlefish&#x27;s sole means of food detection. Some reports incorrectly suggest that a damaged rostrum would render paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health. Laboratory experiments, and field research indicate otherwise. In addition to electroreceptors on the rostrum, paddlefish also have sensory pores covering nearly half of the skin surface extending from the rostrum to the top of the head down to the tips of the operculum (gill flaps). Paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage adequately.

==Habitat and historic range==

Over the past half century, paddlefish populations have been on the decline. Attributable causes are overfishing, pollution, and the encroachment of human development, including the construction of dams which block their seasonal upward migration to ancestral spawning grounds. Other detrimental effects include alterations of rivers which have changed the natural flow, and resulted in the loss of spawning habitat and nursery areas. American paddlefish have been extirpated from much of their Northern peripheral range, including the Great Lakes and Canada, New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania. There is growing concern about their populations in other states.

The Chinese paddlefish was considered anadromous with upstream migration, however little is known about their migration habits and population structure. They were endemic to the Yangtze River Basin in China where they lived primarily in the broad surfaced main stem rivers and shoal zones along the East China Sea. Research suggests they preferred to navigate the middle and lower layers of the water column, and occasionally swam into large lakes. There have been no sightings of Chinese paddlefish since 2003, and were declared extinct in 2019. Past attempts of artificial propagation for restoration purposes failed because of difficulties encountered in keeping captive fish alive.

American paddlefish are native to the Mississippi River basin from New York to Montana and south to the Gulf of Mexico. They have been found in several Gulf Slope drainages in medium to large rivers with long, deep sluggish pools, as well as in backwater lakes and bayous. In Texas, paddlefish occurred historically in the Angelina River, Big Cypress Bayou, Neches River, tributaries of the Red River, Sabine River, San Jacinto River, Sulphur River, and Trinity River. Their historical range also included occurrences in Canada in Lake Huron and Lake Helen, and in 26~27 other states in the United States. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources listed the paddlefish as extirpated from Ontario, Canada under their Endangered Species Act. The IUCN Red List lists the Canadian populations of paddlefish as extirpated, noting there have been no Canadian records since the early 1900s and distribution in Canada was highly peripheral. As a species, the American paddlefish is classified as vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List, and its international trade has been restricted since June 1992 under Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES).

==Life cycle==

Paddlefish are long-lived, and sexually late maturing. Females do not begin spawning until they are six to twelve years old, some even as late as sixteen to eighteen years old. Males begin spawning around age four to seven, some as late as nine or ten years of age. Paddlefish spawn in late spring if the proper combination of events occur; these include water flow, temperature, photoperiod, and availability of gravel substrates suitable for spawning. If all the conditions are not met, paddlefish do not spawn. Research suggests females do not spawn every year, rather they spawn every second or third year while males spawn more frequently, typically every year or every other year.

Paddlefish migrate upstream to spawn, and prefer silt-free gravel bars that would otherwise be exposed to air, or covered by very shallow water were it not for the rises in the river from snow melt and annual spring rains that cause flooding. They are broadcast spawners, also referred to as mass spawners or synchronous spawners. Fertilization occurs externally: Gravid females release their eggs into the water over bare rocks or gravel at the same time males release their sperm. The eggs are adhesive and stick to the rocky substrate. The young are swept downstream after hatching and grow to adulthood in deep freshwater pools.

==Propagation and culture==

The advancements in biotechnology in paddlefish propagation and rearing of captive stock indicate significant improvements in reproduction success, adaptation and survival rates of paddlefish cultured for broodstock development and stock rehabilitation. Such improvements have led to successful practices in reservoir ranching and pond rearing, creating an increasing interest in the global market for paddlefish polyculture.

In a cooperative scientific effort in the early 1970s between the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and its former USSR counterpart, American paddlefish were imported into the former USSR for aquaculture, beginning with five-thousand hatched larvae from Missouri hatcheries in the United States. They were introduced into several rivers in Europe and Asia, and provided the first brood stock that were successfully reproduced in 1984–1986 in Russia. Paddlefish are now being raised in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and the Plovdiv and Vidin regions in Bulgaria. Reproduction was successful in 1988 and 1989, and resulted in the exportation of juvenile paddlefish to Romania and Hungary. In May 2006, specimens of different sizes and weights were caught by professional fisherman near Prahovo in the Serbian part of the Danube River.

In 1988, fertilized paddlefish eggs and larvae from Missouri hatcheries were first introduced into China. Since that time, China imports approximately 4.5 million fertilized eggs and larvae every year from hatcheries in Russia, and the United States. Some of the paddlefish are polycultured in carp ponds, and sold to restaurants while others are cultured for brood stock and caviar production. China has also exported paddlefish to Cuba, where they are farmed for caviar production.

<text>Aerial refueling (en-us), or aerial refuelling (en-gb), also referred to as air refueling, in-flight refueling (IFR), air-to-air refueling (AAR), and tanking, is the process of transferring aviation fuel from one aircraft (the tanker) to another (the receiver) while both aircraft are in flight. The two main refueling systems are &quot;probe-and-drogue&quot;, which is simpler to adapt to existing aircraft and the &quot;flying boom&quot;, which offers faster fuel transfer, but requires a dedicated boom operator station.

The procedure allows the receiving aircraft to remain airborne longer, extending its range or loiter time. A series of air refuelings can give range limited only by crew fatigue/physical needs and engineering factors such as engine oil consumption. Because the receiver aircraft is topped-off with extra fuel in the air, air refueling can allow a takeoff with a greater payload which could be weapons, cargo, or personnel: the maximum takeoff weight is maintained by carrying less fuel and topping up once airborne. Aerial refueling has also been considered as a means to reduce fuel consumption on long-distance flights greater than . Potential fuel savings in the range of 35–40% have been estimated for long-haul flights (including the fuel used during the tanker missions).

Usually, the aircraft providing the fuel is specially designed for the task, although refueling pods may be fitted to existing aircraft designs in the case of &quot;probe-and-drogue&quot; systems. The cost of the refueling equipment on both tanker and receiver aircraft and the specialized aircraft handling of the aircraft to be refueled (very close &quot;line astern&quot; formation flying) has resulted in the activity only being used in military operations; there are no regular civilian in-flight refueling activities. Originally trialed shortly before World War II on a limited scale to extend the range of British civilian transatlantic flying boats, and then employed after World War II on a large scale to extend the range of strategic bombers, aerial refueling since the Vietnam War has been extensively used in large-scale military operations.

==Development history==

===Early experiments===

Some of the earliest experiments in aerial refueling took place in the 1920s; two slow-flying aircraft flew in formation, with a hose run down from a hand-held fuel tank on one aircraft and placed into the usual fuel filler of the other. The first mid-air refueling, based on the development of Alexander P. de Seversky, between two planes occurred on 25 June 1923, between two Airco DH-4B biplanes of the United States Army Air Service. An endurance record was set by three DH-4Bs (a receiver and two tankers) on 27–28 August 1923, in which the receiver airplane remained aloft for more than 37 hours using nine mid-air refueling to transfer of aviation gasoline and of engine oil. The same crews demonstrated the utility of the technique on 25 October 1923, when a DH-4 flew from Sumas, Washington, on the Canada–United States border, to Tijuana, Mexico, landing in San Diego, using mid-air refuelings at Eugene, Oregon, and Sacramento, California.

Similar trial demonstrations of mid-air refueling technique took place at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in England and by the Armée de l&#x27;Air in France in the same year, but these early experiments were not yet regarded as a practical proposition, and were generally dismissed as stunts.

As the 1920s progressed, greater numbers of aviation enthusiasts vied to set new aerial long-distance records, using inflight air refueling. One such enthusiast, who would revolutionize aerial refueling was Sir Alan Cobham, member of the Royal Flying Corps in World War I, and a pioneer of long-distance aviation. During the 1920s, he made long-distance flights to places as far afield as Africa and Australia and he began experimenting with the possibilities of in-flight refueling to extend the range of flight.

Cobham was one of the founding directors of Airspeed Limited, an aircraft manufacturing company that went on to produce a specially-adapted Airspeed Courier that Cobham used for his early experiments with in-flight refueling. This craft was eventually modified by Airspeed to Cobham&#x27;s specification, for a non-stop flight from London to India, using in-flight refueling to extend the plane&#x27;s flight duration.

Meanwhile, in 1929, a group of US Army Air Corps fliers, led by then Major Carl Spaatz, set an endurance record of over 150 hours with a Fokker C-2A named the &quot;Question Mark&quot; over Los Angeles. Between 11 June and 4 July 1930, the brothers John, Kenneth, Albert, and Walter Hunter set a new record of 553 hours 40 minutes over Chicago using two Stinson SM-1 Detroiters as refueler and receiver. Aerial refueling remained a very dangerous process until 1935, when brothers Fred and Al Key demonstrated a spill-free refueling nozzle, designed by A. D. Hunter. They exceeded the Hunters&#x27; record by nearly 100 hours in a Curtiss Robin monoplane, staying aloft for more than 27 days.

The US was mainly concerned about transatlantic flights for faster postal service between Europe and America. In 1931 W. Irving Glover, the second assistant postmaster, wrote an extensive article for &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; concerning the challenges and the need for such a regular service. In his article he even mentioned the use of aerial refueling after takeoff as a possible solution.

At Le Bourget Airport near Paris, the Aéro-Club de France and the 34th Aviation Regiment of the French Air Force were able to demonstrate passing fuel between machines at the annual aviation fete at Vincennes in 1928. The UK&#x27;s Royal Aircraft Establishment was also running mid-air refueling trials, with the aim to use this technique to extend the range of the long-distance flying boats that serviced the British Empire. By 1931 they had demonstrated refueling between two Vickers Virginias, with fuel flow controlled by an automatic valve on the hose which would cut off if contact was lost.

Royal Air Force officer Richard Atcherley had observed the dangerous aerial-refueling techniques in use at barnstorming events in the US and determined to create a workable system. While posted to the Middle East he developed and patented his &#x27;crossover&#x27; system in 1934, in which the tanker trailed a large hooked line that would reel in a similar dropped line from the receiver, allowing the refueling to commence. In 1935, Cobham sold off the airline Cobham Air Routes Ltd to Olley Air Service and turned to the development of inflight refueling, founding the company Flight Refuelling Ltd. Atcherly&#x27;s system was bought up by Cobham&#x27;s company, and with some refinement and continuous improvement through the late &#x27;30s, it became the first practical refueling system.

====Grappled-line looped-hose====

Sir Alan Cobham&#x27;s &quot;grappled-line looped-hose&quot; air-to-air refueling system borrowed from techniques patented by David Nicolson and John Lord, and was publicly demonstrated for the first time in 1935. In the system the receiver aircraft, at one time an Airspeed Courier, trailed a steel cable which was then grappled by a line shot from the tanker, a Handley Page Type W10. The line was then drawn back into the tanker where the receiver&#x27;s cable was connected to the refueling hose. The receiver could then haul back in its cable bringing the hose to it. Once the hose was connected, the tanker climbed sufficiently above the receiver aircraft to allow the fuel to flow under gravity.

When Cobham was developing his system, he saw the need as purely for long-range transoceanic commercial aircraft flights, but modern aerial refueling is used exclusively by military aircraft.

In 1934, Cobham had founded Flight Refuelling Ltd (FRL) and by 1938 had used its &quot;looped-hose&quot; system to refuel aircraft as large as the Short Empire flying boat &quot;Cambria&quot; from an Armstrong Whitworth AW.23. Handley Page Harrows were used in the 1939 trials to perform aerial refueling of the Empire flying boats for regular transatlantic crossings. From 5 August to 1 October 1939, sixteen crossings of the Atlantic were made by Empire flying boats, with fifteen crossings using FRL&#x27;s aerial refueling system. After the sixteen crossings further trials were suspended due to the outbreak of World War II.

During the closing months of World War II, it had been intended that Tiger Force&#x27;s Lancaster and Lincoln bombers would be in-flight refueled by converted Halifax tanker aircraft, fitted with the FRL&#x27;s looped-hose units, in operations against the Japanese homelands, but the war ended before the aircraft could be deployed. After the war ended, the USAF bought a small number of FRL looped-hose units and fitted a number of B-29s as tankers to refuel specially equipped B-29s and later B-50s. The USAF made only one major change in the system used by the RAF. The USAF version had auto-coupling of the refueling nozzle, where the leader line with the refueling hose is pulled to the receiver aircraft and a refueling receptacle on the belly of the aircraft, allowing high-altitude air-to-air refueling and doing away with the aircraft having to fly to a lower altitude to be depressurized so a crew member could manually do the coupling.

This air-to-air refueling system was used by the B-50 Superfortress &quot;Lucky Lady II&quot; of the 43rd Bomb Wing to make its famous first non-stop around-the-world flight in 1949. From 26 February to 3 March 1949, &quot;Lucky Lady II&quot; flew non-stop around the world in 94 hours and 1 minute, a feat made possible by four aerial refuelings from four pairs of KB-29M tankers of the 43d ARS. Before the mission, crews of the 43rd had experienced only a single operational air refueling contact. The flight started and ended at Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas with the refuelings accomplished over the Azores, Saudi Arabia, the Pacific Ocean near Guam, and between Hawaii and the West Coast.

====Probe-and-drogue system====
Cobham&#x27;s company FRL soon realized that their looped-hose system left much to be desired and began work on an improved system that is now commonly called the &quot;probe-and-drogue&quot; air-to-air refueling system and today is one of the two systems chosen by air forces for air-to-air refueling, the other being the flying-boom system. In post-war trials the RAF used a modified Lancaster tanker employing the much improved probe-and-drogue system, with a modified Gloster Meteor F.3 jet fighter, serial &quot;EE397&quot;, fitted with a nose-mounted probe. On 7 August 1949, the Meteor flown by FRL test pilot Pat Hornidge took off from Tarrant Rushton and remained airborne for 12 hours and 3 minutes, receiving of fuel in ten refuelings from a Lancaster tanker. Hornidge flew an overall distance of , achieving a new jet endurance record. FRL still exists as part of Cobham plc.

Modern specialized tanker aircraft have equipment specially designed for the task of offloading fuel to the receiver aircraft, based on drogue and probe, even at the higher speeds modern jet aircraft typically need to remain airborne.

In January 1948, General Carl Spaatz, then the first Chief of Staff of the new United States Air Force, made aerial refueling a top priority of the service. In March 1948, the USAF purchased two sets of FRL&#x27;s looped-hose in-flight refueling equipment, which had been in practical use with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) since 1946, and manufacturing rights to the system. FRL also provided a year of technical assistance. The sets were immediately installed in two Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, with plans to equip 80 B-29s.

Flight testing began in May 1948 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and was so successful that in June orders went out to equip all new B-50s and subsequent bombers with receiving equipment. Two dedicated air refueling units were formed on 30 June 1948: the 43d Air Refueling Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, and the 509th Air Refueling Squadron at Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico. The first ARS aircraft used FRL&#x27;s looped-hose refueling system, but testing with a boom system followed quickly in the autumn of 1948.

The first use of aerial refueling in combat took place during the Korean War, involving F-84 fighter-bombers flying missions from Japanese airfields, due to Chinese-North Korean forces overrunning many of the bases for jet aircraft in South Korea, refueling from converted B-29s using the drogue-and-probe in-flight refueling system with the probe located in one of the F-84&#x27;s wing-tip fuel tanks.

==Systems==
===Flying boom===

The flying boom is a rigid, telescoping tube with movable flight control surfaces that a boom operator on the tanker aircraft extends and inserts into a receptacle on the receiving aircraft. All boom-equipped tankers (e.g. KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender, KC-46 Pegasus) have a single boom and can refuel one aircraft at a time with this mechanism.

====History====
In the late 1940s, General Curtis LeMay, commander of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), asked Boeing to develop a refueling system that could transfer fuel at a higher rate than had been possible with earlier systems using flexible hoses, resulting in the flying boom system. The B-29 was the first to employ the boom, and between 1950 and 1951, 116 original B-29s, designated KB-29Ps, were converted at the Boeing plant at Renton, Washington. Boeing went on to develop the world&#x27;s first production aerial tanker, the KC-97 Stratofreighter, a piston-engined Boeing Stratocruiser (USAF designation C-97 Stratofreighter) with a Boeing-developed flying boom and extra kerosene (jet fuel) tanks feeding the boom. The Stratocruiser airliner itself was developed from the B-29 bomber after World War II. In the KC-97, the mixed gasoline/kerosene fuel system was clearly not desirable and it was obvious that a jet-powered tanker aircraft would be the next development, having a single type of fuel for both its own engines and for passing to receiver aircraft. The 230 mph (370 km/h) cruise speed of the slower, piston-engined KC-97 was also a serious issue, as using it as an aerial tanker forced the newer jet-powered military aircraft to slow down to mate with the tanker&#x27;s boom, a highly serious issue with the newer supersonic aircraft coming into service at that time, which could force such receiving aircraft in some situations to slow down enough to approach their stall speed during the approach to the tanker. It was no surprise that, after the KC-97, Boeing began receiving contracts from the USAF to build jet tankers based on the Boeing 367-80 (Dash-80) airframe. The result was the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, of which 732 were built.

The flying boom is attached to the rear of the tanker aircraft. The attachment is gimballed, allowing the boom to move with the receiver aircraft. The boom contains a rigid pipe to transfer fuel. The fuel pipe ends in a nozzle with a flexible ball joint. The nozzle mates to the &quot;receptacle&quot; in the receiver aircraft during fuel transfer. A poppet valve in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver&#x27;s refueling receptacle. Once properly mated, toggles in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.

The &quot;flying&quot; boom is so named because flight control surfaces, small movable airfoils that are often in a V-tail configuration, are used to move the boom by creating aerodynamic forces. They are actuated hydraulically and controlled by the boom operator using a control stick. The boom operator also telescopes the boom to make the connection with the receiver&#x27;s receptacle.

To complete an aerial refueling, the tanker and receiver aircraft rendezvous, flying in formation. The receiver moves to a position behind the tanker, within safe limits of travel for the boom, aided by director lights or directions radioed by the boom operator. Once in position, the operator extends the boom to make contact with the receiver aircraft. Once in contact, fuel is pumped through the boom into the receiver aircraft.

While in contact, the receiver pilot must continue to fly within the &quot;air refueling envelope&quot;, the area in which contact with the boom is safe. Moving outside of this envelope can damage the boom or lead to mid-air collision, for example the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash. If the receiving aircraft approaches the outer limits of the envelope, the boom operator will command the receiver pilot to correct their position and disconnect the boom if necessary.

When the desired amount of fuel has been transferred, the two aircraft disconnect and the receiver aircraft departs the formation. When not in use, the boom is stored flush with the bottom of the tanker&#x27;s fuselage to minimize drag.

In the KC-97 and KC-135 the boom operator lies prone, while the operator is seated in the KC-10, all viewing operations through a window at the tail. The KC-46 seats two operators at the front of the aircraft viewing camera video on 3D screens.

The US Air Force fixed-wing aircraft use the flying boom system, along with Australia (KC-30A), the Netherlands (KDC-10), Israel (modified Boeing 707), Japan (KC-767), Turkey (KC-135Rs), and Iran (Boeing 707 and 747). The system allows higher fuel flow rates (up to / per minute for the KC-135, but does require a boom operator, and can only refuel one aircraft at a time.

===Probe-and-drogue===

The probe-and-drogue refueling method employs a flexible hose that trails from the tanker aircraft. The &quot;drogue&quot; (or &quot;para-drogue&quot;), sometimes called a &quot;basket&quot;, is a fitting resembling a shuttlecock, attached at its narrow end (like the &quot;cork&quot; nose of a shuttlecock) with a valve to a flexible hose. The drogue stabilizes the hose in flight and provides a funnel to aid insertion of the receiver aircraft probe into the hose. The hose connects to a hose drum unit (HDU). When not in use, the hose/drogue is reeled completely into the HDU.

The receiver has a &quot;probe&quot;, which is a rigid, protruding or pivoted retractable arm placed on the aircraft&#x27;s nose or fuselage to make the connection. Most modern versions of the probe are usually designed to be retractable, and are retracted when not in use, particularly on high-speed aircraft.

At the end of the probe is a valve that is closed until it mates with the drogue&#x27;s forward internal receptacle, after which it opens and allows fuel to pass from tanker to receiver. The valves in the probe and drogue that are most commonly used are to a NATO standard and were originally developed by the company Flight Refuelling Limited in the UK and deployed in the late 1940s and 1950s. This standardization enables drogue-equipped tanker aircraft from many nations to refuel probe-equipped aircraft from other nations.

The NATO-standard probe system incorporates shear rivets that attach the refueling valve to the end of the probe. This is so that if a large side or vertical load develops while in contact with the drogue, the rivets shear and the fuel valve breaks off, rather than the probe or receiver aircraft suffering structural damage. A so-called &quot;broken probe&quot; (actually a broken fuel valve, as described above) may happen if poor flying technique is used by the receiver pilot, or in turbulence. Sometimes the valve is retained in the tanker drogue and prevents further refueling from that drogue until removed during ground maintenance.

==== Buddy store ====
A &quot;buddy store&quot; or &quot;buddy pod&quot; is an external pod loaded on an aircraft hardpoint that contains a hose and drogue system (HDU). Buddy stores allow fighterbomber aircraft to be reconfigured for &quot;buddy tanking&quot; other aircraft. This allows an air combat force without dedicated/specialized tanker support (for instance, a carrier air wing) to extend the range of its strike aircraft. In other cases, using the buddy store method allows a carrier-based aircraft to take-off with a heavier than usual load less fuel than might be necessary for its tasking. The aircraft would then topped-up with fuel from an HDU-equipped &quot;buddy&quot; tanker, a method previously used by the Royal Navy in operating its Supermarine Scimitar, de Havilland Sea Vixen, and Blackburn Buccaneers; in the Buccaneer&#x27;s case using a bomb-bay-mounted tank and HDU.
The tanker aircraft flies straight and level and extends the hose/drogue, which is allowed to trail out behind and below the tanker under normal aerodynamic forces. The pilot of the receiver aircraft extends the probe (if required) and uses normal flight controls to &quot;fly&quot; the refueling probe directly into the basket. This requires a closure rate of about two knots (walking speed) to push the hose several feet into the HDU and solidly couple the probe and drogue. Too little closure will cause an incomplete connection and no fuel flow (or occasionally leaking fuel). Too much closure is dangerous because it can trigger a strong transverse oscillation in the hose, severing the probe tip.

The optimal approach is from behind and below (not level with) the drogue. Because the drogue is relatively light (typically soft canvas webbing) and subject to aerodynamic forces, it can be pushed around by the bow wave of approaching aircraft, exacerbating engagement even in smooth air. After initial contact, the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver a certain distance (typically, a few feet), and the hose is reeled slowly back onto its drum in the HDU. This opens the tanker&#x27;s main refueling valve allowing fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure (assuming the tanker crew has energized the pump). Tension on the hose is aerodynamically &#x27;balanced&#x27; by a motor in the HDU so that as the receiver aircraft moves fore and aft, the hose retracts and extends, thus preventing bends in the hose that would cause undue side loads on the probe. Fuel flow is typically indicated by illumination of a green light near the HDU. If the hose is pushed in too far or not far enough, a cutoff switch will inhibit fuel flow, which is typically accompanied by an amber light. Disengagement is commanded by the tanker pilot with a red light.

The US Navy, Marine Corps, and some Army aircraft refuel using the &quot;hose-and-drogue&quot; system, as do most aircraft flown by western European militaries. The Soviet Union also used a hose-and-drogue system, dubbed UPAZ, and thus later Russian aircraft may be equipped with probe and drogue. The Chinese PLAF has a fleet of Xian H-6 bombers modified for aerial refueling, and plans to add Russian Ilyushin Il-78 aerial refueling tankers.
Tankers can be equipped with multipoint hose-and-drogue systems, allowing them to refuel two (or more) aircraft simultaneously, reducing time spent refueling by as much as 75% for a four-aircraft strike package.

===Boom drogue adapter units===

USAF KC-135 and French Air Force KC-135FR refueling-boom equipped tankers can be field-converted to a probe-and-drogue system using a special adapter unit. In this configuration, the tanker retains its articulated boom, but has a hose/drogue at the end of it instead of the usual nozzle. The tanker boom operator holds the boom still while the receiver aircraft flies the probe into the basket. Unlike the soft canvas basket used in most drogue systems, the adapter units use a steel basket, grimly known as the &quot;iron maiden&quot; by naval aviators because of its unforgiving nature. Soft drogues can be contacted slightly off center, wherein the probe is guided into the hose receptacle by the canvas drogue. The metal drogue, when contacted even slightly off center, will pivot out of place, potentially &quot;slapping&quot; the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and causing damage.

The other major difference with this system is that when contacted, the hose does not &quot;retract&quot; into an HDU. Instead, the hose bends depending on how far it is pushed toward the boom. If it is pushed too far, it can loop around the probe or nose of the aircraft, damage the windscreen, or cause contact with the rigid boom. If not pushed far enough, the probe will disengage, halting fueling. Because of a much smaller position-keeping tolerance, staying properly connected to a KC-135 adapter unit is considerably more difficult than staying in a traditional hose/drogue configuration. When fueling is complete, the receiver carefully backs off until the probe refueling valve disconnects from the valve in the basket. Off center disengagements, like engagements, can cause the drogue to &quot;prang&quot; the probe and/or strike the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage.

===Multiple systems===

Some tankers have both a boom and one or more complete hose-and-drogue systems. The USAF KC-10 has both a flying boom and a separate hose-and-drogue system manufactured by Cobham. Both are on the aircraft centerline at the tail of the aircraft, so only one can be used at once. However, such a system allows all types of probe- and receptacle-equipped aircraft to be refueled in a single mission, without landing to install an adapter. Other tankers are equipped with hose-and-drogue attachments that do not interfere with the operation of the centerline boom: many KC-135s are equipped with dual under-wing attachments known as Multi-point Refueling System (MPRSs), while some KC-10s and A330 MRTTs have similar under-wing refueling pods (referred to as Wing Air Refueling Pods or WARPs on the KC-10).

===Wing-to-wing===
A small number of Soviet Tu-4s and Tu-16s (the tanker variant was Tu-16Z). used a wing-to-wing method. Similar to the probe-and-drogue method but more complicated, the tanker aircraft released a flexible hose from its wingtip. An aircraft flying alongside had to catch the hose with a special lock under its wingtip. After the hose was locked and the connection was established, the fuel was pumped.

===Simple grappling===
Some historic systems used for pioneering aerial refueling used the grappling method, where the tanker aircraft unreeled the fuel hose and the receiver aircraft would grapple the hose midair, reel it in and connect it so that fuel can be transferred either with the assistance of pumps or simply by gravity feed. This was the method used on the Question Mark endurance flight in 1929.

==Compatibility issues==
The probe-and-drogue system is not compatible with flying boom equipment, creating a problem for military planners where mixed forces are involved. Incompatibility can also complicate the procurement of new systems. The Royal Canadian Air Force currently wish to purchase the F-35A, which can only refuel via the flying boom, but only possess probe-and-drogue refuelers. The potential cost of converting F-35As to probe-and-drogue refueling (as is used on US Navy &amp; Marine Corps F-35Bs and F-35Cs) added to the early-2010s political controversy which surrounded F-35 procurement within the RCAF.

These concerns can be addressed by drogue adapters (see section &quot;Boom drogue adapter units&quot; above) that allow drogue aircraft to refuel from boom-equipped aircraft, and by refuelers that are equipped with both drogue and boom units and can thus refuel both types in the same flight, such as the KC-10, MPRS KC-135, or Airbus A330 MRTT.

===Strategic===

The development of the KC-97 and Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers was pushed by the Cold War requirement of the United States to be able to keep fleets of nuclear-armed B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers airborne around-the-clock either to threaten retaliation against a Soviet strike for mutual assured destruction, or to bomb the USSR first had it been ordered to do so. The bombers would fly orbits around their assigned positions from which they were to enter Soviet airspace if they received the order, and the tankers would refill the bombers&#x27; fuel tanks so that they could keep a force in the air 24 hours a day, and still have enough fuel to reach their targets in the Soviet Union. This also ensured that a first strike against the bombers&#x27; airfields could not obliterate the US&#x27;s ability to retaliate by bomber.

In 1958, Valiant tankers in the UK were developed with one HDU mounted in the bomb-bay. Valiant tankers of 214 Squadron were used to demonstrate radius of action by refueling a Valiant bomber non-stop from UK to Singapore in 1960 and a Vulcan bomber to Australia in 1961. Other UK exercises involving refueling aircraft from Valiant tankers included Javelin and Lightning fighters, also Vulcan and Victor bombers. For instance, in 1962 a squadron of Javelin air defense aircraft was refueled in stages from the UK to India and back (exercise &quot;Shiksha&quot;). After the retirement of the Valiant in 1965, the Handley Page Victor took over the UK refueling role and had three hoses (HDUs). These were a fuselage-mounted HDU and a refueling pod on each wing. The center hose could refuel any probe-equipped aircraft, the wing pods could refuel the more maneuverable fighter/ground attack types.

A byproduct of this development effort and the building of large numbers of tankers was that these tankers were also available to refuel cargo aircraft, fighter aircraft, and ground attack aircraft, in addition to bombers, for ferrying to distant theaters of operations. This was much used during the Vietnam War, when many aircraft could not have covered the transoceanic distances without aerial refueling, even with intermediate bases such as Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii and Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. In addition to allowing the transport of the aircraft themselves, the cargo aircraft could also carry matériel, supplies, and personnel to Vietnam without landing to refuel. KC-135s were also frequently used for refueling of air combat missions from air bases in Thailand.

The USAF SR-71 Blackbird strategic reconnaissance aircraft made frequent use of air-to-air refueling. Indeed, design considerations of the aircraft made its mission impossible without aerial refueling. Based at Beale AFB in central California, SR-71s had to be forward-deployed to Europe and Japan prior to flying actual reconnaissance missions. These trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flights during deployment were impossible without aerial refueling. The SR-71&#x27;s designers traded takeoff performance for better high-speed, high-altitude performance, necessitating takeoff with less-than-full fuel tanks from even the longest runways. Once airborne, the Blackbird would accelerate to supersonic speed using afterburners to facilitate structural heating and expansion. The magnitude of temperature changes experienced by the SR-71, from parked to its maximum speed, resulted in significant expansion of its structural parts in cruise flight. To allow for the expansion, the Blackbird&#x27;s parts had to fit loosely when cold, so loosely, in fact, that the Blackbird constantly leaked fuel before heating expanded the airframe enough to seal its fuel tanks. Following the supersonic dash the SR-71 would then rendezvous with a tanker to fill its now nearly empty tanks before proceeding on its mission. This was referred to as the &quot;LTTR&quot; (for &quot;Launch To Tanker Rendezvous&quot;) profile. LTTR had the added advantage of providing an operational test of the Blackbird&#x27;s refueling capability within minutes after takeoff, enabling a Return-To-Launch-Site abort capability if necessary. At its most efficient altitude and speed, the Blackbird was capable of flying for many hours without refueling. The SR-71 used a special fuel, JP-7, with a very high flash point to withstand the extreme skin temperatures generated during Mach 3+ cruise flight. While JP-7 could be used by other aircraft, its burn characteristics posed problems in certain situations (such as high-altitude, emergency engine starts) that made it less than optimal for aircraft other than the SR-71.

Normally, all the fuel aboard a tanker aircraft may be either offloaded, or burned by the tanker as necessary. To make this possible, the KC-135 fuel system incorporated gravity draining and pumps to allow moving fuel from tank to tank depending on mission needs. Mixing JP-7 with JP-4 or Jet A, however, rendered it unsuitable for use by the SR-71, so the Air Force commissioned a specially modified KC-135 variant, the KC-135Q, which included changes to the fuel system and operating procedures preventing inadvertent inflight mixing of fuel intended for offload with fuel intended for use by the tanker. SR-71 aircraft were refueled exclusively by KC-135Q tankers.

===Tactical===
Tankers are considered &quot;force multipliers&quot;, because they convey considerable tactical advantages. Primarily, aerial refueling adds to the combat radius of attack, fighter and bombers aircraft, and allows patrol aircraft to remain airborne longer, thereby reducing the number of aircraft necessary to accomplish a given mission. Aerial refueling can also mitigate basing issues that might otherwise place limitations on combat payload. Combat aircraft operating from airfields with shorter runways must limit their takeoff weight, which could mean a choice between range (fuel) and combat payload (munitions). Aerial refueling, however, eliminates many of these basing difficulties because a combat aircraft can take off with a full combat payload and refuel immediately.

==Operational history==
===Cold War===
Even as the first practical methods for aerial refueling were being developed, military planners had already envisioned what missions could be greatly enhanced by using such techniques. In the emerging Cold War climate of the late 1940s, the ability for bombers to perform increasingly long distance missions would enable targets to be struck even from air bases on a different continent. Thus, it became commonplace for nuclear-armed strategic bombers to be equipped with aerial refueling apparatus and for it to be used to facilitate long distance patrols.

During the late 1950s, aerial refueling had become so prevalent amongst the bombers operated by the US Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command that many, such as the Convair B-58 Hustler, would operate largely or entirely out of bases in the continental United States while maintaining strategic reach. This practice was promoted to address security concerns as well as diplomatic objections from some overseas states that did not want nuclear weapons kept on their soil. In one early demonstration of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress&#x27;s global reach, performed between 16 and 18 January 1957, three B-52Bs made a non-stop flight around the world during &quot;Operation Power Flite&quot;, during which 24,325 miles (21,145 nmi, 39,165 km) was covered in 45 hours 19 minutes (536.8 smph) with multiple in-flight refuelings being performed from KC-97s.

While development of the Avro Vulcan strategic bomber was underway, British officials recognised that its operational flexibility could be improved by the provision of in-flight refueling equipment. Accordingly, from the 16th aircraft to be completed onwards, the Vulcan was furnished with in-flight refueling receiving equipment. While continuous airborne patrols were flown by the RAF for a time, these were deemed to be untenable, and the refueling mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet largely fell into disuse during the 1960s. When the RAF chose to optimise its bomber fleet away from high-altitude flight and towards low-level penetration missions, bombers such as the Handley Page Victor were fitted with aerial refueling probes and additional fuel tanks to counter the decreased range from the shift in flight profile.

During the mid-1950s, to deliver France&#x27;s independent nuclear deterrent, work commenced on what would become the Dassault Mirage IV supersonic bomber. The dimensions of this bomber was greatly determined by the viability of aerial refueling, with work on an enlarged variant of the Mirage IV ultimately being aborted in favour of a greater reliance upon aerial tanker aircraft instead. In order to refuel the Mirage IVA fleet, France purchased 14 (12 plus 2 spares) US Boeing C-135F tankers. Mirage IVAs also often operated in pairs, with one aircraft carrying a weapon and the other carrying fuel tanks and a buddy refueling pack, allowing it to refuel its partner en route to the target. While able to strike at numerous targets inside of the Soviet Union, the inability for the Mirage IV to return from some missions had been a point of controversy during the aircraft&#x27;s design phase.

On 6 July 1951, the first combat air refueling of fighter-type aircraft took place over Korea. Three RF-80As launched from Taegu with the modified tip-tanks and rendezvoused with a tanker offshore of Wonsan, North Korea. Through in-flight refueling, the RF-80s effectively doubled their range, which enabled them to photograph valuable targets in North Korea.

=== Vietnam War ===

During the Vietnam War, it was common for USAF fighter-bombers flying from Thailand to North Vietnam to refuel from KC-135s en route to their target. Besides extending their range, this enabled the F-105s and F-4 Phantoms to carry more bombs and rockets. Tankers were also available for refueling on the way back if necessary. In addition to ferrying aircraft across the Pacific Ocean, aerial refueling made it possible for battle-damaged fighters, with heavily leaking fuel tanks, to hook up to the tankers and let the tanker feed its engine(s) until the point where they could glide to the base and land. This saved numerous aircraft. 

The US Navy frequently used carrier-based aerial tankers like the KA-3 Skywarrior to refuel Navy and Marine aircraft such as the F-4, A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, and A-7 Corsair II. This was particularly useful when a pilot returning from an airstrike was having difficulty landing and was running low on jet fuel. This gave them fuel for more attempts at landing for a successful &quot;trap&quot; on an aircraft carrier. The KA-3 could also refuel fighters on extended Combat Air Patrol. USMC jets based in South Vietnam and Thailand also used USMC KC-130 Hercules transports for air-to-air refueling on missions.

During late August 1970, a pair of HH-53C helicopters performed the first Trans-Pacific flight by a helicopter, flying from Eglin AFB in Florida to Danang in South Vietnam. In addition to making multiple en route stops to refuel on the ground, aerial refueling was also used in this display of the type&#x27;s long-range capabilities. The flight proved to be roughly four times faster than the traditional dispatching of rotorcraft to the theatre by ship.

=== Middle East ===

During the 1980s Iran–Iraq War, the Iranian Air Force maintained at least one KC 707-3J9C aerial tanker, which the Islamic Republic had inherited from the Shah&#x27;s government. This was used most effectively on 4 April 1981, refueling eight IRIAF F-4 Phantoms on long-range sorties into Iraq to bomb the H-3 Al Walid airfield near the Jordanian border, destroying 27–50 Iraqi fighter jets and bombers. However, the Iranian Air Force was forced to cancel its 180-day air offensive and attempts to control Iranian airspace due to unsustainable rates of attrition.

The Israeli Air Force has a fleet of Boeing 707s equipped with a boom refueling system similar to the KC-135, this system has the Israeli name &quot;Ram&quot;, used to refuel and extend the range of fighter bombers such as the F-15I and F-16I for deterrent and strike missions, they are nearing 60 years old and Israel does not disclose the number of tankers in their fleet. In 1985, Israeli F-15s used heavily modified Boeing 707 aircraft to provide aerial refueling over the Mediterranean Sea in order to extend their range for Operation Wooden Leg, an air raid on the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) near Tunis, Tunisia, that necessitated a 2,000 km flight. As of 2021 Israel has ordered four of a planned eight Boeing KC-46 Pegasus boom refueling tankers and has requested that the first two aircraft be fast-tracked for delivery in 2022 when they were to be delivered in 2023. The Jerusalem Post reports that Israeli commanders have made this request to enhance the strategic deterrence against Iran, the same article reports that the US, whose air force is also taking its first deliveries of the aircraft type, has refused to move forward the deliveries while supporting Israel&#x27;s deterrence; the Jpost editor writing &quot;The US State Department approved the possible sale of up to eight KC-46 tanker aircraft and related equipment to Israel for an estimated cost of $2.4 billion last March(i.e. 5/2020), marking the first time that Washington has allowed Jerusalem to buy new tankers.&quot;

=== Falklands War ===

During the Falklands War, aerial refueling played a vital role in all of the successful Argentine attacks against the Royal Navy. The Argentine Air Force had only two KC-130H Hercules available and they were used to refuel both Air Force and Navy A-4 Skyhawks and Navy Super Etendards in their Exocet strikes. The Hercules on several occasions approached the islands (where the Sea Harriers were in patrol) to search and guide the A-4s in their returning flights. On one of those flights (callsign &quot;Jaguar&quot;) one of the KC-130s went to rescue a damaged A-4 and delivered of fuel while carrying it to its airfield at San Julian. However, the Mirage IIIs and Daggers lack of air refueling capability prevented them from achieving better results. The Mirages were unable to reach the islands with a strike payload, and the Daggers could do so only for a five-minute strike flight.

On the British side, air refueling was carried out by the Handley Page Victor K.2 and, after the Argentine surrender, by modified C-130 Hercules tankers. These aircraft aided deployments from the UK to the Ascension Island staging post in the Atlantic and further deployments south of bomber, transport and maritime patrol aircraft. The most famous refueling missions were the 8,000 nmi (15,000 km) &quot;Operation Black Buck&quot; sorties which used 14 Victor tankers to allow an Avro Vulcan bomber (with a flying reserve bomber) to attack the Argentine-captured airfield at Port Stanley on the Falkland Islands. With all the aircraft flying from Ascension, the tankers themselves needed refueling. The raids were the longest-range bombing raids in history until surpassed by the Boeing B-52s flying from the States to bomb Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War and later B-2 flights.

=== Gulf War ===

During the time of Operation Desert Shield, the military buildup to the Persian Gulf War, US Air Force Boeing KC-135s &amp; McDonnell Douglas KC-10As, and USMC KC-130 Hercules aircraft were deployed to forward air bases in England, Diego Garcia, and Saudi Arabia. Aircraft stationed in Saudi Arabia normally maintained an orbit in the Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone, informally known as &quot;Frisbee&quot;, and refueled coalition aircraft whenever necessary. Two side by side tracks over central Saudi Arabia called &quot;Prune&quot; and &quot;Raisin&quot; featured 2–4 basket equipped KC-135 tankers each and were used by Navy aircraft from the Red Sea Battle Force. Large Navy strike groups from the Red Sea would send A-6 tankers to the Prune and Raisin tracks ahead of the strike aircraft arriving to top off and take up station to the right of the Air Force tankers thereby providing an additional tanking point. RAF Handley Page Victor and Vickers VC10 tankers were also used to refuel British and coalition aircraft and were popular with the US Navy for their docile basket behavior and having three point refueling stations. An additional track was maintained close to the northwest border for the E-3 AWACS aircraft and any Navy aircraft needing emergency fuel. These 24-hour air-refueling zones enabled the intense air campaign during Desert Storm. An additional 24/7 tanker presence was maintained over the Red Sea itself to refuel Navy F-14 Tomcats maintaining Combat Air Patrol tracks. During the conflict&#x27;s final week, KC-10s moved inside Iraq to support barrier CAP missions set up to block Iraqi fighters from escaping to Iran.
On 16–17 January 1991, the first combat sortie of Operation Desert Storm, and the longest combat sortie in history at that time, was launched from Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. Seven B-52Gs flew a thirty-five-hour mission to the region and back to launch 35 Boeing Air Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs) with the surprise use of conventional warheads. This attack, which successfully destroyed 85–95 percent of intended targets, would have been impossible without the support of refueling tankers.

An extremely useful tanker in Desert Storm was the USAF&#x27;s KC-10A Extender. Besides being larger than the other tankers deployed, the KC-10A is equipped with the USAF &quot;boom&quot; refueling and also the &quot;hose-and-drogue&quot; system, enabling it to refuel not only USAF aircraft, and also USMC and US Navy jets that use the &quot;probe-and-drogue&quot; system, and also allied aircraft, such as those from the UK and Saudi Arabia. KC-135s may be equipped with a drogue depending on the mission profile. With a full jet fuel load, the KC-10A is capable of flying from a base on the American east coast, flying nonstop to Europe, transferring a considerable amount of fuel to other aircraft, and returning to its home base without landing anywhere else.

On 24 January 1991, the Iraqi Air Force launched the Attack on Ras Tanura, an attempt to bomb the Ras Tanura oil facility in Saudi Arabia. On their way to the target, the Iraqi attack aircraft were refueled by tanker at an altitude of 100 meters. The attack ultimately failed, with two aircraft turning back and the remaining two shot down.

=== Centennial Contact ===
On 27 June 2023 the United States Air Force, including the Air National Guard, commemorated the 100-year anniversary of the first aerial refueling by holding &quot;Operation Centennial Contact.&quot; Aircraft from various bases conducted aerial refueling exercises across the United States, as well as conducting flyovers in 50 states. 152 aircraft were slated to participate in the operation, with 82 tanker aircraft providing refueling support to 70 other participating aircraft.

The aircraft participating included 49 Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker; 29 Boeing KC-46 Pegasus; four McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extenders, and aircraft receiving fuel included 
21 Lockheed C-130 Hercules; 13 Boeing C-17 Globemaster III; ten McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle; eight Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor; six Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II; five General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons; four Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II; two Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses; and one Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.
==Helicopters==
Helicopter in-flight refueling (HIFR) is a variation of aerial refueling when a naval helicopter approaches a warship (not necessarily suited for landing operations) and receives fuel through the cabin while hovering. Alternatively, some helicopters like the HH-60 Pave Hawk are equipped with a probe extending out the front can be refueled from a drogue-equipped tanker aircraft in a similar manner to fixed-wing aircraft by matching a high forward speed for a helicopter to a slow speed for the fixed-wing tanker.

==Longest crewed flight record==
A mission modified Cessna 172 Skyhawk with a crew of two set the world record for the longest continuous crewed flight without landing of 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes, and five seconds in 1958. A Ford truck was outfitted with a fuel pump, tank, and other paraphernalia required to support the aircraft in flight. The publicity flight for a Las Vegas area hotel ended when the aircraft&#x27;s performance had degraded to the point where the Cessna had difficulty climbing away from the refueling vehicle.

==Developments==

* Commercial tankers are occasionally used by military forces. The Omega Aerial Refueling Services company and Metrea Strategic Mobility are contracted by the US Navy. In June 2023, Metrea completed the first commercial refueling of the US Air Force.
* Autonomous (hands off) refueling using probe/drogue systems was investigated by NASA, potentially for use by unmanned aerial vehicles in the KQ-X program.

<doc id="237957" wikidata="Q181424" url="?curid=237957" title="Explosively pumped flux compression generator">
<text>An explosively pumped flux compression generator (EPFCG) is a device used to generate a high-power electromagnetic pulse by compressing magnetic flux using high explosives.

EPFCGs are physically destroyed during operation, making them single-use. They require a starting current pulse to operate, usually supplied by capacitors.

Explosively pumped flux compression generators are used to create ultrahigh magnetic fields in physics and materials science research and extremely intense pulses of electric current for pulsed power applications. They are being investigated as power sources for electronic warfare devices known as transient electromagnetic devices that generate an electromagnetic pulse without the costs, side effects, or enormous range of a nuclear electromagnetic pulse device.

The first work on these generators was conducted by the VNIIEF center for nuclear research in Sarov in the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1950s followed by Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States.

== History ==
At the start of the 1950s, the need for very short and powerful electrical pulses became evident to Soviet scientists conducting nuclear fusion research. The Marx generator, which stores energy in capacitors, was the only device capable at the time of producing such high power pulses. The prohibitive cost of the capacitors required to obtain the desired power motivated the search for a more economical device. The first magneto-explosive generators, which followed from the ideas of Andrei Sakharov, were designed to fill this role.

== Mechanics ==
Magneto-explosive generators use a technique called &quot;magnetic flux compression&quot;, described in detail below. The technique is made possible when the time scales over which the device operates are sufficiently brief that resistive current loss is negligible, and the magnetic flux through any surface surrounded by a conductor (copper wire, for example) remains constant, even though the size and shape of the surface may change.

This flux conservation can be demonstrated from Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The most intuitive explanation of this conservation of enclosed flux follows from Lenz&#x27;s law, which says that any change in the flux through an electric circuit will cause a current in the circuit which will oppose the change. For this reason, reducing the area of the surface enclosed by a closed loop conductor with a magnetic field passing through it, which would reduce the magnetic flux, results in the induction of current in the electrical conductor, which tends to keep the enclosed flux at its original value. In magneto-explosive generators, the reduction in area is accomplished by detonating explosives packed around a conductive tube or disk, so the resulting implosion compresses the tube or disk. Since flux is equal to the magnitude of the magnetic field multiplied by the area of the surface, as the surface area shrinks the magnetic field strength inside the conductor increases. The compression process partially transforms the chemical energy of the explosives into the energy of an intense magnetic field surrounded by a correspondingly large electric current.

The purpose of the flux generator can be either the generation of an extremely strong magnetic field pulse, or an extremely strong electric current pulse; in the latter case the closed conductor is attached to an external electric circuit. This technique has been used to create the most intense manmade magnetic fields on Earth; fields up to about 1000 teslas (about 1000 times the strength of a typical neodymium permanent magnet) can be created for a few microseconds. 
=== Elementary description of flux compression ===

An external magnetic field (blue lines) threads a closed ring made of a perfect conductor (with zero resistance). The total magnetic flux formula_1 through the ring is equal to the magnetic field formula_2 multiplied by the area formula_3 of the surface spanning the ring. The nine field lines represent the magnetic flux threading the ring.
Suppose the ring is deformed, reducing its cross-sectional area. The magnetic flux threading the ring, represented by five field lines, is reduced by the same ratio as the area of the ring. The variation of the magnetic flux induces a current &quot;(red arrows)&quot; in the ring by Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, which in turn creates a new magnetic field circling the wire &quot;(green arrows)&quot; by Ampere&#x27;s circuital law. The new magnetic field opposes the field outside the ring but adds to the field inside, so that the total flux in the interior of the ring is maintained: four green field lines added to the five blue lines give the original nine field lines.
By adding together the external magnetic field and the induced field, it can be shown that the net result is that the magnetic field lines originally threading the hole stay inside the hole, thus flux is conserved, and a current has been created in the conductive ring. The magnetic field lines are &quot;pinched&quot; closer together, so the (average) magnetic field intensity inside the ring increases by the ratio of the original area to the final area. 

== The various types of generators ==
The simple basic principle of flux compression can be applied in a variety of different ways. Soviet scientists at the VNIIEF in Sarov, pioneers in this domain, conceived of three different types of generators:

* In the first type of generator (MK-1, 1951) developed by Robert Lyudaev, the magnetic flux produced by a wound conductor is confined to the interior of a hollow metallic tube surrounded by explosives, and submitted to a violent compression when the explosives are fired; a device of the same type was developed in the United States a dozen years later by C. M. (Max) Fowler&#x27;s team at Los Alamos.
* In the second type of generator (MK-2, 1952), the magnetic flux, confined between the windings of the external conductor and a central conductive tube filled with explosive, is compressed by the conical &#x27;piston&#x27; created by the deformation of the central tube as the detonation wave travels across the device.
* A third type of generator (DEMG), developed by Vladimir Chernyshev, is cylindrical, and contains a stack of concave metallic disks, facing each other in pairs, to create hollow modules (with the number varying according to the desired power), and separated by explosives; each module functions as an independent generator.

Such generators can, if necessary, be utilised independently, or even assembled in a chain of successive stages: the energy produced by each generator is transferred to the next, which amplifies the pulse, and so on. For example, it is foreseen that the DEMG generator will be supplied by a MK-2 type generator.

Also, these can be either destructed just after an experiment, or used again and again while complying acceptable time to use.

=== Hollow tube generators ===
In the spring of 1952, R. Z. Lyudaev, E. A. Feoktistova, G. A. Tsyrkov, and A. A. Chvileva undertook the first experiment with this type of generator, with the goal of obtaining a very high magnetic field.
The MK-1 generator functions as follows:
* A longitudinal magnetic field is produced inside a hollow metallic conductor, by discharging a bank of capacitors into the solenoid that surrounds the cylinder. To ensure a rapid penetration of the field in the cylinder, there is a slit in the cylinder, which closes rapidly as the cylinder deforms;
* The explosive charge placed around the tube is detonated in a manner that ensures that the compression of the cylinder commences when the current through the solenoid is at its maximum;
* The convergent cylindrical shock wave unleashed by the explosion produces a rapid contraction (greater than 1 km/s) of the central cylinder, compressing the magnetic field, and creating an inductive current, as per the explanation above (the speed of contraction permits, to first approximation, the neglect of Joule losses and the consideration of the cylinder as a perfect conductor).

The first experiments were able to attain magnetic fields of millions of gauss (hundreds of teslas), given an initial field of 30 kG (3 T) which is in the free space &quot;air&quot; the same as H = B/μ0 = (3 Vs/m2) / (4π × 10−7 Vs/Am) = (approximately 2.4 MA/m).

=== Helical generators ===
Helical generators were principally conceived to deliver an intense current to a load situated at a safe distance. They are frequently used as the first stage of a multi-stage generator, with the exit current used to generate a very intense magnetic field in a second generator.
The MK-2 generators function as follows:
* A longitudinal magnetic field is produced in between a metallic conductor and a surrounding solenoid, by discharging a battery of capacitors into the solenoid;
* After the charge is ignited, a detonation wave propagates in the explosive charge placed in the interior of the central metallic tube (from left to right on the figure);
* Under the effect of the pressure of the detonation wave, the tube deforms and becomes a cone which contacts the helically wrapped coil, diminishing the number of turns not short-circuited, compressing the magnetic field and creating an inductive current;
* At the point of maximal flux compression, the load switch is opened, which then delivers the maximal current to the load.

The MK-2 generator is particularly interesting for the production of intense currents, up to 108 A (100 MA), as well as a very high energy magnetic field, as up to 20% of the explosive energy can be converted to magnetic energy, and the field strength can attain 2 × 106 gauss (200 T).

The practical realization of high performance MK-2 systems required the pursuit of fundamental studies by a large team of researchers; this was effectively achieved by 1956, following the production of the first MK-2 generator in 1952, and the achievement of currents over 100 megaamperes from 1953.

=== Disc generators ===
A DEMG generator functions as follows:
* Conductive metallic discs, assembled in facing pairs to create hollow modules having the form of a lined torus, with explosive packed between pairs of modules, are stacked inside a cylinder; the number of modules can vary according to the desired power (the figure shows a device of 15 modules), as well as the radius of the discs (of the order of 20 to 40 cm).
* Current runs through the device, supplied by a MK-2 generator, and an intense magnetic field is created inside each module.
* When initiated, the explosion begins on the axis and propagates radially outwards, deforming the disc shaped protuberances with triangular section and pushing them away from the axis. The outward movement of this section of conductor plays the role of a piston.
* As the explosion proceeds, the magnetic field is compressed in the inside of each module by the conductive piston and the simultaneous drawing together of the inner faces, also creating an inductive current.
* As the induced current attains its maximum, the fuse opening switch fuses and the load switch simultaneously closes, allowing the current to be delivered to the load (the mechanism for the operation of the load switch is not explained in available documentation).

Systems using up to 25 modules have been developed at VNIIEF. Output of 100 MJ at 256 MA have been produced by a generator a metre in diameter composed of three modules.

<text>Big Bill Broonzy (born Lee Conley Bradley; June 26, 1893 or 1903August 14, 1958) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. His career began in the 1920s, when he played country music to mostly African-American audiences. In the 1930s and 1940s, he navigated a change in style to a more urban blues sound popular with working-class black audiences. In the 1950s, a return to his traditional folk-blues roots made him one of the leading figures of the emerging American folk music revival and an international star. His long and varied career marks him as one of the key figures in the development of blues music in the 20th century.

Broonzy copyrighted more than 300 songs, including adaptations of traditional folk songs and original blues songs. As a blues composer, he was unique in writing songs that reflected his rural-to-urban experiences.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Born Lee Conley Bradley, he was one of the 17 children of Frank Broonzy (Bradley) and Mittie Belcher. The date and place of his birth are disputed. Broonzy claimed to have been born in Scott, Mississippi, but a body of emerging research compiled by the blues historian Robert Reisman suggests that he was born in Jefferson County, Arkansas. Broonzy claimed he was born in 1893, and many sources report that year, but family records discovered after his death suggested that the year was 1903. 

Soon after his birth the family moved to an area called Lake Dick, Arkansas, near Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Bill spent his youth. He began playing music at an early age. At the age of 10 he made himself a fiddle from a cigar box and learned how to play spirituals and folk songs from his uncle, Jerry Belcher. He and a friend, Louis Carter, who played a homemade guitar, began performing at social and church functions. These early performances included playing at &quot;two-way&quot;: picnics where whites and blacks danced at the same event, but with different stages for blacks and whites.

On the understanding that he was born in 1898 rather than earlier or later, sources suggest that in 1915, 17-year-old Broonzy was married and working as a sharecropper. He had given up playing the fiddle and had become a preacher. There is a story that he was offered $50 and a new violin if he would play for four days at a local venue. Before he could respond to the offer, his wife took the money and spent it, so he had to play.

It has been previously stated that in 1916 his crop and stock were wiped out by drought and he went to work locally until he was drafted into the Army in 1917, that he served for two years in Europe during the First World War and that after his discharge from the Army in 1919, he left Pine Bluff and moved to the Little Rock area. However, biographer Bob Riesman, after examining Broonzy&#x27;s family records, census records and local draft cards, concluded that Broonzy was only 14 in 1917 when the U.S. entered WW I and that Broonzy never actually served in the Army during World War I. In 1920, Broonzy moved north to Chicago in search of opportunity.

===1920s===
After arriving in Chicago, Broonzy switched from fiddle to guitar. He learned to play the guitar from the veteran minstrel and medicine show performer Papa Charlie Jackson, who began recording for Paramount Records in 1924. Through the 1920s Broonzy worked at a string of odd jobs, including Pullman porter, cook, foundry worker and custodian, to supplement his income, but his main interest was music. He played regularly at rent parties and social gatherings, steadily improving his guitar playing. During this time he wrote one of his signature tunes, a solo guitar piece called &quot;Saturday Night Rub&quot;.

Thanks to his association with Jackson, Broonzy was able to get an audition with Paramount executive J. Mayo Williams. His initial test recordings, made with his friend John Thomas on vocals, were rejected, but Broonzy persisted, and his second try, a few months later, was more successful. His first record, &quot;House Rent Stomp&quot;, backed with &quot;Big Bill Blues&quot;, credited to Big Bill and Thomps (Paramount 12656), was released in 1927. Although the recording was not well received, Paramount retained its new talent and in the next few years released more records by Big Bill and Thomas. The records sold poorly. Reviewers considered his style immature and derivative.

===1930s===
In 1930, Paramount for the first time used Broonzy&#x27;s full name on a recording, &quot;Station Blues&quot; – albeit misspelled as &quot;Big Bill Broomsley&quot;. Record sales continued to be poor, and Broonzy was working at a grocery store. He was picked up by Lester Melrose, who produced musical acts for various labels, including Champion Records and Gennett Records. Harum Scarums, a trio composed of Broonzy, Georgia Tom, and Mozelle Alderson, recorded the two-part &quot;Alabama Scratch&quot; in Grafton, Wisconsin, for Paramount Records (Paramount 13054) in January 1931, and it was reported that it sounded &quot;as if it was a real party&quot;. Broonzy recorded several sides released in the spring of 1931 under the name Big Bill Johnson. In March 1932, he traveled to New York City and began recording for the American Record Corporation on their line of less expensive labels (Melotone Records, Perfect Records and others). These recordings sold better, and Broonzy was becoming better known. Back in Chicago he was working regularly in South Side clubs, and he toured with Memphis Minnie.

In 1934 Broonzy moved to RCA Victor&#x27;s subsidiary Bluebird Records and began recording with the pianist known as &quot;Black Bob.&quot; With Black Bob his music was evolving to a stronger R&amp;B sound, and his singing sounded more assured and personal. In 1937, he began playing with the pianist Joshua Altheimer, recording and performing with a small instrumental group, including &quot;traps&quot; (drums), double bass and one or more melody instruments (horns or harmonica or both). In March 1938 he began recording for Vocalion Records.

Broonzy&#x27;s reputation grew. In 1938 he was asked to fill in for the recently deceased Robert Johnson at the &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall, produced by John H. Hammond. He also appeared in the 1939 concert at the same venue. His success led him in the same year to a small role in &quot;Swingin&#x27; the Dream&quot;, Gilbert Seldes&#x27;s jazz adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, set in New Orleans in 1890 and featuring, among others, Louis Armstrong as Bottom and Maxine Sullivan as Titania, with the Benny Goodman sextet.

Broonzy&#x27;s recorded output through the 1930s only partially reflects his importance to Chicago blues. His half-brother, Washboard Sam, and his friends Jazz Gillum and Tampa Red, also recorded for Bluebird. Broonzy was credited as the composer of many of their most popular recordings of that time. He reportedly played guitar on most of Washboard Sam&#x27;s tracks. Because of his exclusive arrangements with his record label, Broonzy was careful to allow his name to appear on these artists&#x27; records only as a composer.

===1940s===
Broonzy expanded his work during the 1940s as he honed his songwriting skills, which showed a knack for appealing to his more sophisticated city audience as well as people that shared his country roots. His work in this period shows he performed across a wider musical spectrum than almost any other bluesman before or since, including in his repertoire ragtime, hokum, country blues, urban blues, jazz-tinged songs, folk songs and spirituals. After World War II, Broonzy recorded songs that were the bridge that allowed many younger musicians to cross over to the future of the blues: the electric blues of postwar Chicago. His 1945 recordings of &quot;Where the Blues Began&quot;, with Big Maceo on piano and Buster Bennett on sax, and &quot;Martha Blues&quot;, with Memphis Slim on piano, clearly showed the way forward. One of his best-known songs, &quot;Key to the Highway&quot;, appeared at this time. When the second American Federation of Musicians strike ended in 1948, Broonzy was signed by Mercury Records.

In 1949, Broonzy became part of a touring folk music revue, &quot;I Come for to Sing&quot;, formed by Win Stracke, which also included Studs Terkel and Lawrence Lane. Terkel called him the key figure in the group. The revue had some success thanks to the emerging folk revival. When the revue played at Iowa State University in Ames, Broonzy met a local couple, Leonard and Lillian Feinberg, who found him a custodial job at Iowa State when a doctor ordered Broonzy to discontinue touring later that year. He remained in Ames until 1951, when he resumed touring.

===1950s===
Broonzy left Chicago in 1950 to work as a janitor at Iowa State, having performed there and established relationships with a likely view to develop his own influence and craft. After his return to performing, the exposure from &quot;I Come for to Sing&quot; made it possible for him to tour Europe in 1951. Here Broonzy was greeted with standing ovations and critical praise wherever he played. The tour marked a turning point in his fortunes, and when he returned to the United States he was a featured act with many prominent folk artists, such as Pete Seeger, and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. From 1953 on, Broonzy&#x27;s financial position became more secure, and he was able to live well on his earnings from music. He returned to his solo folk-blues roots and travelled and recorded extensively. His numerous performances during the 1950s in British folk and jazz clubs were a significant influence on British audiences&#x27; understanding of the blues and bolstered the nascent British folk revival and early blues scene. Many British musicians on the folk scene, such as Bert Jansch, cited him as an important influence. John Lennon and Paul McCartney, of the Beatles, also cited Broonzy as an important early influence.

In 1953, Vera (King) Morkovin and Studs Terkel took Broonzy to Circle Pines Center, a cooperative year-round camp in Delton, Michigan, where he was employed as the summer camp cook. He worked there in the summer from 1953 to 1956. On July 4, 1954, Pete Seeger travelled to Circle Pines and gave a concert with Broonzy on the farmhouse lawn, which was recorded by Seeger for the new fine-arts radio station in Chicago, WFMT-FM.

In 1955, with the assistance of the Belgian writer Yannick Bruynoghe, Broonzy published his autobiography, &quot;Big Bill Blues&quot;. He toured worldwide, traveling to Africa, South America, the Pacific] region, and across Europe into early 1956. In 1957 Broonzy was one of the founding faculty members of the Old Town School of Folk Music. On the school&#x27;s opening night, December 1, he taught a class, &quot;The Glory of Love&quot;.

===Illness and death===
In the late 1940s, Big Bill Broonzy&#x27;s doctor warned him that 20 years of constant traveling and living the lifestyle of an &quot;itinerant musician&quot; would have dangerous effects on his aging body and health. In June 1956, Broonzy began to feel &quot;frazzled&quot;, explaining to Pim Van Isveldt that &quot;his nerves might be bad&quot;. From 1956 to 1957, as he was performing his last tour in Europe, Broonzy&#x27;s condition worsened, and he was subsequently diagnosed with cancer in July 1957. Broonzy made his last recordings in Chicago from July 12 to 14, 1957.

In September 1957, Broonzy wrote to Van Isveldt that he recently underwent surgery that removed one of his lungs. Broonzy tried to convince her that he would return to London, but he never toured Europe again. A second surgery that took place in the fall of 1957 ended up severing his vocal cords, and although another operation was planned in the early winter of 1958, in hopes of repairing his damaged vocal cords, Broonzy never performed again.

By 1958, Broonzy was suffering from throat cancer. A benefit concert was organized to assist Broonzy with his medical debt, and the concert ended up raising approximately $2,000. After the two-and-a-half hour performance, Broonzy reportedly stood on stage to thunderous applause, thanking his friends and colleagues for &quot;making the evening so memorable&quot;.

On August 14 or 15, 1958 (sources vary on the precise date), Broonzy died in an ambulance from cancer as he was being rushed to Billings Hospital from his home at 4716 South Parkway. His funeral was held on August 19, and he was buried in Lincoln Cemetery, in Blue Island, Illinois.

==Style and influence==
Broonzy&#x27;s influences included the folk music, spirituals, work songs, ragtime music, hokum, and country blues he heard growing up and the styles of his contemporaries, including Jimmie Rodgers, Blind Blake, Son House, and Blind Lemon Jefferson. Broonzy combined all these influences into his own style of the blues, which foreshadowed the postwar Chicago blues, later refined and popularized by artists such as Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon.

Although he had been a pioneer of the Chicago blues style and had employed electric instruments as early as 1942, white audiences in the 1950s wanted to hear him playing his earlier songs accompanied only by his own acoustic guitar, which they considered to be more authentic.

He portrayed the discrimination against black Americans in his song &quot;Black, Brown and White&quot;. The song has been used globally in education about racism, but in the late 1990s its inclusion in antiracism education at a school in Greater Manchester, England, led pupils to taunt the school&#x27;s only black pupil with the song&#x27;s chorus, &quot;If you&#x27;re white, that&#x27;s all right, if you&#x27;re brown, stick around, but if you&#x27;re black, oh brother get back, get back, get back&quot;. The national media reported that the problem became so bad that the nine-year-old boy was withdrawn from the school by his mother. The song had already been adopted by the National Front, a far-right British political party that peaked in popularity in the 1970s and opposed nonwhite immigration to Britain.

A considerable part of Broonzy&#x27;s early ARC/CBS recordings has been reissued in anthologies by CBS-Sony, and other earlier recordings have been collected on blues reissue labels, as have his European and Chicago recordings of the 1950s. The Smithsonian&#x27;s Folkways Records has also released several albums featuring Broonzy.

In 1980, he was inducted into the first class of the Blues Hall of Fame, along with 20 other of the world&#x27;s greatest blues legends. In 2007, he was inducted into the first class of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame, along with 11 other musical greats, including Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Gene Autry, and Lawrence Welk.

As an acoustic guitar player, Broonzy inspired Muddy Waters, Memphis Slim, Ray Davies, John Renbourn, Rory Gallagher, and Steve Howe. In the September 2007 issue of &quot;Q Magazine&quot;, Ronnie Wood, of the Rolling Stones, cited Broonzy&#x27;s track &quot;Guitar Shuffle&quot; as his favorite guitar music. Wood remarked: &quot;It was one of the first tracks I learnt to play, but even to this day I can&#x27;t play it exactly right.&quot; Eric Clapton has cited Broonzy as a major inspiration, commenting that Broonzy &quot;became like a role model for me, in terms of how to play the acoustic guitar&quot;. Clapton featured Broonzy&#x27;s song &quot;Hey Hey&quot; on his album &quot;Unplugged&quot;. The Derek and the Dominos album &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; includes their recording of &quot;Key to the Highway&quot;. Tom Jones has cited Broonzy as a major influence on him and in a 2012 interview described his first experience of Broonzy&#x27;s music as having been &quot;Fuck, what is that? Who is that?&quot; Another musician heavily influenced by Broonzy was Jerry Garcia, who upon hearing a recording of Broonzy&#x27;s blues playing decided to exchange an accordion he received on his 15th birthday for an electric guitar.

In the benediction at the 2009 inauguration ceremony of President Barack Obama, the civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Joseph Lowery paraphrased Broonzy&#x27;s song &quot;Black, Brown and White Blues&quot;.

In collaboration with the WFMT network, the Chicago History Museum, and the Library of Congress, an hour-long interview of Broonzy, recorded on September 13, 1955, by Studs Terkel was made available online. The interview includes reflections on his life and on the blues tradition, a performance of one of his most famous songs, &quot;Alberta&quot;, and performances of &quot;Goin&#x27; Down the Road Feelin&#x27; Bad&quot; and other classics.

==Discography==
Between 1927 and 1942, Broonzy recorded 224 songs, which makes him the second most prolific blues recording artist during that period. These were released before blues records were tracked by recording industry trade magazines. By the time &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine instituted its &quot;race music&quot; charts in October 1942, Broonzy&#x27;s recordings were less popular, and none appeared in the charts.

===Selected singles===
Many of Broonzy&#x27;s singles were issued by more than one record company, sometimes under different names. Additional versions of some songs were also released. These are marked with a superscript plus sign.
Broonzy also appeared as a sideman on recordings by Lil Green, Sonny Boy Williamson I, Washboard Sam, Jazz Gillum and other Bluebird Records artists.

<text>The Center for Creative Imaging (CCI) was a short-lived education and training center located in the renovated Knox Mill complex in Camden, Maine from about 1991 to 1994. It was an Eastman Kodak Company facility designed to teach digital imaging and related subject matter to artists, design professionals, photographers, and production staff.

The 27,000 square foot (2,500 m2) facility sat on the Megunticook River, and contained what was then state-of-the-art equipment, including over 100 high-end Apple Macintosh IIfx computers, hard drives of up to 500 Mb of storage per machine, large displays, and an array of scanners, digital cameras, and output devices.

Classes ran from one to five days in length, generally three, and covered digital imaging areas like publishing, photography, and illustration. Several invitational and special events brought artists and experts like Paul Davis, Milton Glaser, Gary Panter, Graham Nash, Edward Tufte, and dozens of others to lecture and teach. Many of the leading photographers of the day using cutting-edge digital techniques taught there; other well-known artists came to take classes.

The Time &quot;Man of the Year&quot; cover for 1991 of Ted Turner was assembled by photographer Greg Heisler at the CCI with the assistance of staff. The creation of the cover took long enough to nearly delay the printing of the issue.

Kodak chose to sell the CCI in 1993 to a local businessman who, without the vast resources of a multinational company behind him, was unable to transform it into a profitable teaching facility, despite expanding its focus to include conventional photography in competition with the long-running Maine Photographic Workshops down the road in Rockport, Maine.

The CCI&#x27;s building was purchased by MBNA, the credit card company. All of the fixtures, including polished granite and hardwoods, were removed, and the brickwork and exterior of the building were painted the drab gray and green corporate colors. MBNA left Camden before its merger with Bank of America in 2005.

The CCI is still remembered around Camden quite well, as many people from the area had jobs there as teaching assistants and other staff, and many locals took classes and changed their careers. Many dozens of expensive Steelcase chairs, even after more than a decade, could still be found throughout local businesses who bought them at the closing sale.

<text>Deinotherium is an extinct genus of large, elephant-like proboscideans that lived from about the middle-Miocene until the early Pleistocene. Although its appearance is reminiscent of modern elephants, &quot;Deinotherium&quot; possessed a notably more flexible neck, with limbs adapted to a more cursorial lifestyle, as well as tusks which grew down and curved back from the mandible, as opposed to the forward-growing maxillary tusks of extant elephants. &quot;Deinotherium&quot; was a widespread genus, ranging from East Africa, north to Southern Europe, and east to the Indian subcontinent. They were primarily browsing animals, with a diet largely consisting of leaves. The genus most likely went extinct due to environmental changes, such as forested areas gradually being replaced by open grasslands, during the latter half of the Neogene. &quot;Deinotherium&quot; thrived the longest in Africa, where they survived until the end of the Early Pleistocene, around 1 million years ago.

==History and naming==

&quot;Deinotherium&quot; has a long history, possibly dating back as early as the 17th century when a French surgeon named Matsorier found the bones of large animals in an area known as the &quot;field of giants&quot; near Lyon. Matsorier is said to have exhibited these bones across France and Germany as the supposed bones of a French monarch, until he was exposed and the bones were handed over to the French National Museum of Natural History. In 1775 researchers recognized the bones as belonging to an animal &quot;similar to a mammoth&quot; and during the late 18th/early 19th century George Cuvier hypothesized that they actually belonged to a large tapir with upwards curving tusks which he named &quot;Tapir gigantesque&quot;. Another early hypothesis suggested that &quot;Deinotherium&quot; was a sirenian that used its tusks to anchor itself to the sea floor while sleeping.

The genus &quot;Deinotherium&quot; was coined in 1829 by Johann Jakob von Kaup to describe a fossil skull and mandible discovered in Germany. The type specimen, &quot;D. giganteum&quot; was at the time thought to be an evolutionary link between sloths and mastodonts. Further remains were discovered and named, including many that would later come to be considered part of the genus &quot;Prodeinotherium&quot;. These additional remains also helped solidify &quot;Deinotherium&#x27;s&quot; position within Proboscidea and finds in India described as &quot;D. indicum&quot; extended the range of the genus outside of Europe. Fossils of an exceptionally large specimen found in Manzati, Romania between the late 19th and early 20th century were described as &quot;D. gigantissimum&quot;. In Bulgaria &quot;Deinotherium&quot; remains have been found from 1897 onward, with one particular fossil of an almost complete animal found in 1965. These remains were officially described in December of 2006 as &quot;D. thraceiensis&quot;, making it the most recently named species, although later studies synonymize it with the other European species.

The name &quot;Deinotherium&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek , &#x27; meaning &quot;terrible&quot; and , &#x27; meaning &quot;beast&quot;). Some authors have on occasion referred to &quot;Deinotherium&quot; as &quot;Dinotherium&quot;, following latinization of the first element of the name. Although pronunciation remains unchanged, &quot;Deinotherium&quot; remains the valid spelling as it was coined first.

==Description==

&quot;Deinotherium&quot; was a large-bodied proboscidean, with some species considerably exceeding modern elephants in size. Two adult males of &quot;D. giganteum&quot; were around tall at the shoulder and weighed . This is similar to adult males of &quot;D. proavum&quot;, one of which weighed and was tall at the shoulder. The average male and female &quot;D. proavum&quot; has been estimated to have had a shoulder height of and a weight of . However, both these species are smaller than a 45-year-old male of &quot;D. &quot;thraceiensis&quot;&quot;, at tall at the shoulder and . The most recent species, &quot;D. bozasi&quot;, was around tall at the shoulder and weighed . The general anatomy of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; is similar to that of modern elephants with pillar-like limbs, although proportionally longer and more slender than those of other proboscideans. The bones of the toes are longer and less robust than in elephants and the neck likewise differs notably in that it is relatively longer, though still quite short compared to other modern browsers like giraffes.

The permanent tooth formula of &quot;D. giganteum&quot; was formula_1 (deciduous formula_2), with vertical cheek tooth replacement. Two sets of bilophodont and trilophodont teeth were present. The molars and rear premolars were vertical shearing teeth, and suggest that deinotheres became an independent evolutionary branch very early on; the other premolars were used for crushing. The cranium was short, low, and flattened on the top, in contrast to more advanced proboscideans, which have a higher and more domed forehead, with very large, elevated occipital condyles. The largest skulls of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; reached a length of . The nasal opening was retracted and large, indicating a large trunk. The rostrum was long and the rostral fossa broad. The mandibular symphyses (the lower jaw-bone) were very long and curved downward, which, with the backward-curved tusks, is a distinguishing feature of the group.

These tusks are without doubt the most immediately visible feature of &quot;Deinotherium&quot;. Unlike in modern proboscideans, which possess tusks that grow from the upper incisors, the tusks of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; grow from the lower incisors, with upper incisors and upper and lower canines missing entirely. The curvature is initially formed by the mandible itself, with the teeth themselves erupting at only the halfway point of the curve. The degree to which the tusks follow the direction predetermined by the mandible varies between specimens, with some tusks following the curve and pointing backwards, forming an almost semicircular shape, while in other specimens the tusks continue down almost vertically. The tusks have a roughly oval cross-section and could reach a length of .

Although the presence of an elephant-like proboscis or trunk in &quot;Deinotherium&quot; is evident thanks to the size and shape of the external nares, the exact shape and size of this trunk is a matter that has long been debated. Historic depictions commonly portray it as very elephantine with a long trunk and tusks breaking through the skin below an elephantine lower lip. In the early 2000s Markov and colleagues published papers on the facial soft tissue of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; contesting these ideas, instead suggesting an alternative soft tissue reconstruction. In the first of these publications the authors argue that, due to the origin of these animal&#x27;s tusks, the lower lip should be situated beneath them as they evolved their classic downturned appearance. They further suggest that, while a trunk would be present, it would likely not resemble that of modern elephants and instead be more robust and muscular, which they reason is evidenced by the lack of a proper insertion surface. Although later research concurs that the trunk or proboscis of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; was likely notably different from those of modern proboscideans, the idea of a short tapir-like trunk is questioned. In particular, it is pointed out that the tall stature and still relatively short neck of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; would render it very difficult for the animal to drink without assuming a more complex posture. Thus it is suggested that the trunk must have been at least long enough for the animal to effectively drink.

==Species==

Throughout the long history of deinotheriid research, 31 species have been described and assigned to the family, many on the basis of poorly sampled material, especially teeth of varying size. The amount of species recognized by authors differs depending on researchers, but the three species most commonly considered valid are listed below.
;D. bozasi
:Known from East Africa, &quot;Deinotherium bozasi&quot; was the last known species of &quot;Deinotherium&quot;, surviving in the Kanjera Formation, Kenya, until the early Pleistocene roughly 1 million years ago. It is characterized by a narrower rostral trough, a smaller but higher nasal aperture, a higher and narrower cranium, and a shorter mandibular symphysis than the other two species. In a 2013 publication Martin Pickford notes that &quot;D. bozasi&quot; has mandibles anatomically similar to those of &quot;D. proavum&quot;, however most specimens are smaller than those of the European species. To explain this, two hypotheses are suggested, one that they share a common ancestor and the other that &quot;D. bozasi&quot; may be an example of Allen&#x27;s rule, which states that animals at lower latitudes are typically smaller than relatives at higher latitudes. However Markov and colleagues suggest that the similar mandibular anatomy may be a case of parallel evolution between late European species and &quot;D. bozasi&quot; in response to aridification and an increased need for effective mastication.
;D. giganteum
:The type species &quot;D. giganteum&quot; was found in Europe from the Middle Miocene to Early Pliocene. However, the exact extinction of &quot;D. giganteum&quot; in Europe is unknown. The last known occurrences in Central and Western Europe appear to be in MN13 (Messinian to Zanclean), while material from Russia might extend the range of the species to MN15 (Ruscinian). Fossils of &quot;D. giganteum&quot; have also been found on the island of Crete in the upper Miocene Faneroméni Formation, during a time when the island was still connected to the mainland.
;D. indicum
:The Asian species, &quot;D. indicum&quot; is distinguished by a more robust dentition as well as p4-m3 intravalley tubercles and found across the Indian subcontinent (India and Pakistan) during the Middle and Late Miocene. It disappeared from the fossil record about 7 million years ago (Late Miocene). Although it is generally regarded as valid, some researchers argue that it is synonymous with &quot;D. proavum&quot; and that the later name would take precedence. Pickford, for instance, argues that fossils from Iran create a geographic link between European populations and the Indian specimens, concluding that they may be one single wide ranging species.

One hypothesis opposing this three-species model suggests that, rather than being a single consistent species lasting throughout the Miocene, &quot;D. giganteum&quot; actually represents multiple chronospecies, with the type species only applying to the intermediate form.

Other species that have been described include:
;D. levius (Jourdan, 1861)
:&quot;D. levius&quot; is a European species of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; recovered from sediments dating to the late Astaracian to Aragonian. While it is considered a synonym of &quot;D. giganteum&quot; by some researchers, others propose that it is a stratigraphically distinct chronospecies and the earliest of European &quot;Deinotherium&quot;. In accordance to this hypothesis, &quot;D. levius&quot; would eventually give rise to &quot;D. giganteum&quot; by the Vallesian stage of the Miocene, after which the two species continued to coexist until the formers extinction.
;D. proavum (Eichwald, 1831)
:&quot;D. proavum&quot; is a large bodied species of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; that may be a junior synonym of &quot;Deinotherium giganteum&quot;. Other research meanwhile proposes that it, alongside &quot;D. giganteum&quot; and &quot;D. levius&quot;, is part of a single anagenetic lineage of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; species. For this hypothesis it has been suggested that it evolved from &quot;D. giganteum&quot; during the late Vallesion to Turolian, with early members of the species still being similar in size to its ancestor before surpassing it later during its range. However, the assignment of specimens to &quot;D. proavum&quot; is largely based on stratigraphy and size, making the differentiation between species difficult, especially with some research suggesting that the two species continued to coexist.
;&quot;D. gigantissimus&quot;
:&quot;D. gigantissimus&quot; from Romania is typically considered to be a larger specimen belonging either to &quot;D. giganteum&quot; or &quot;D. proavum&quot; (depending on how many species are recognized by the respective author). The situation is similar in &quot;D. thraceiensis&quot; from Bulgaria, another notably large deinothere, described in 2006 but usually lumped into other European species by subsequent publications. The state of Asian species is especially complex, with a multitude of specimens being described from poor remains. These include &quot;D. sindiense&quot; (Lydekker, 1880), &quot;D. orlovii&quot; (Sahni and Tripathi, 1957), &quot;D. naricum&quot; (Pilgrim, 1908), and &quot;D. anguistidens&quot; (Koch 1845), all of which are generally considered dubious by publications of the 21st century. Only one other species from Africa was described, &quot;D. hopwoodi&quot; (Osborn, 1936), based on teeth from the Omo Basin in Ethiopia. However his research was published posthumously and was predated by &quot;D. bozasi&quot;, described two years prior.

Another matter that complicates the amount of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; species recognized by science is the state of the genus &quot;Prodeinotherium&quot;. One prevailing theory is that &quot;Prodeinotherium&quot; is a distinct genus ancestral to the larger &quot;Deinotherium&quot; species. Other researchers, however, argue that the anatomical differences, the difference in size in particular, are not enough to properly distinguish the two, which would subsequently render species of &quot;Prodeinotherium&quot; as &quot;Deinotherium&quot; instead. This would create the combinations &quot;D. bavaricum&quot;, &quot;D. cuvieri&quot; (both European), &quot;D. hobleyi&quot; (Africa), &quot;P. pentapotamiae&quot;, and possibly &quot;D. sinense&quot; (Asia).

&quot;Deinotherium&quot; was a widespread genus, found across vast areas of East Africa, Europe, the Arabian Peninsula and South to East Asia. In Europe fossils are especially common in the southeast, with up to half of known specimens in the region originating in Bulgaria. Especially significant specimens include those found in Ezerovo, Plovdiv Province (type specimen of &quot;D. thraceiensis&quot;) and near Varna. Romania likewise yielded significant remains, with one notably large specimen being found by Grigoriu Ștefănescu near Mânzați (type specimen of &quot;D. gigantissimum&quot;). The fossils of the two now-invalid species are displayed at the National Museum of Natural History, Bulgaria and the Grigore Antipa National Museum of Natural History, Romania respectively. Multiple specimens have also been found in Greece and even on the island of Crete, indicating that the large animal had traveled there over a potential landbridge. Towards the east &quot;Deinotherium&quot; is known from finds in Russia (Rostov-on-Don), Georgia, and Turkey. The range of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; furthermore extends over the Middle East, with the holotype of &quot;D. indicum&quot; being found on the island of Perim (Yemen) in the Red Sea. Fossils are also known from Iran and multiple localities on the Indian Subcontinent such as the Siwalik Hills. The easternmost occurrence of the genus appears to be in the province of Gansu, Northwest China. The western range of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; spans most of West and Central Europe including Hungary, the Czech Republic (Františkovy Lázně), Austria (Gratkorn Locality), Switzerland (Jura Mountains), France (&quot;Field of Giants&quot;), Portugal, Spain and Germany. Some of the earliest and most significant finds in Germany have been made in the Dinotheriensande (Eppelsheim Formation) of the Mainz Basin, named for their great abundance of deinothere remains. The holotype specimen of &quot;Deintherium&quot;, described by Kaup in the early 1800s, stems from this part of Europe. Outside of Eurasia, &quot;Deinotherium bozasi&quot; is found in East Africa, with specimens known from the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, the Omo Basin and Middle Awash of Ethiopia, and multiple localities in Kenya. &quot;D. bozasi&quot; remains have also been found in the Kenyan Chemoigut Beds around Lake Baringo, as well as the Kubi Algi Formation and Koobi Fora Formation in East Rudolf. An additional tooth is known from Sahabi, Libya and it&#x27;s possible that both &quot;Deinotherium&quot; and &quot;Prodeinotherium&quot; coexisted in the Kenyan Ngorora Formation.

==Evolution==

The origin of deinotheriids can be found in the Oligocene of Africa with the relatively small bodied &quot;Chilgatherium&quot;. Initially restricted to Africa, the continued northward movement of the African Plate eventually caused the Proboscidean Datum Event, during which proboscideans diversified and spread into Eurasia, among them the ancestral &quot;Prodeinotherium&quot;, thought to be the direct predecessor of the larger &quot;Deinotherium&quot;. Generally, &quot;Deinotherium&quot; displays relatively little change in morphology throughout its evolution, but a steady increase in body size from 2 meters shoulder height in &quot;Prodeinotherium&quot; to up to 4 meters in later &quot;Deinotherium&quot; species and a mass far exceeding even large African elephants. The reasons for this rapid increase in body size is interpreted to have had multiple factors influencing it. On the one hand, increased size is an effective predator deterrent, especially during the Miocene when carnivorans had reached a great diversity including hyaenodonts, amphicyonids and large cats. Secondly, continued aridification during the Miocene increasingly split up woodlands, with greater distances of open landscape stretching between the food sources of browsers such as &quot;Deinotherium&quot;. This also accounts for the morphological adaptations seen in the limbs of &quot;Deinotherium&quot;, better suited for long distance travel. Furthermore, the appearance of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; coincided with falling temperatures during the middle Miocene. According to Bergmann&#x27;s rule, these circumstances favor increased body mass for maintaining heat in cold temperatures. Despite the many key adaptations deinotheres developed for effective foraging, the continued aridification that progressed throughout the Miocene eventually led to the extinction of the group, which failed to survive without readily available food sources matching their diet. Populations in Western Europe were the first to disappear, followed later by those in Eastern Europe. While European lineages of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; had gone extinct with the onset of the Pliocene, the genus managed to survive notably longer in its southern range in Africa. The last known &quot;Deinotherium&quot; remains, assigned to &quot;D. bozasi&quot;, were found in sediments dating to the Pleistocene, approximately 1 million years ago.
==Paleoecology==

Several key adaptations suggest that &quot;Deinotherium&quot; was a folivorous, browsing proboscidean that preferred open woodland habitats and fed on the leaves of the tree canopy. In Asia &quot;D. indicum&quot; has been associated with wet and warm, low-energy woodland and in Portugal deinotheriid remains were found in regions corresponding with moist, tropical to subtropical woodland conditions likened to modern Senegal. A browsing lifestyle is supported by the inclination of the occiput that gives &quot;Deinotherium&quot; a slightly more raised head posture, and their teeth, which strongly resemble those of modern tapirs, animals that predominantly feed on fruits, flowers, bark and leaves. Their limbs show some notable differences to &quot;Prodeinotherium&quot;, allowing for a more agile mode of locomotion and allowing for easier travel across open landscapes in the search of food, which coincides with the widespread breakup of forests and expansion of grasslands during the time &quot;Deinotherium&quot; lived in Europe. Fossil finds from the Austrian Gratkorn locality and the Mainz Basin in Germany indicate that &quot;Deinotherium&quot; was not a permanent resident in some areas it inhabited. In Austria it has been suggested that they traversed areas on a regular basis, while in Germany there is evidence for the animals range shifting with changing climatic conditions, present during subtropical climate conditions and absent in subboreal conditions.

One of the most enigmatic features of &quot;Deinotherium&quot; are their downturned tusks and their function. Research conducted on &quot;Deinotherium&quot; suggests that these tusks were likely not used for digging, nor are they sexually dimorphic, leaving use in feeding as their most likely function. These tusks exhibit patterns of wear, in particular on their medial and caudal sides. In a 2001 paper Markov and colleagues argue that &quot;Deinotherium&quot; could have used its tusks to remove branches that would have gotten in the way of feeding, while using the proboscis to transport leaf material into its mouth. From there &quot;Deinotherium&quot; would have used a powerful tongue (inferred based on a notable trough at the front of the symphysis) to further manipulate its food. Different tusk anatomy in young individuals would suggest altered feeding strategies in juveniles.
