<doc id="227007" wikidata="Q768100" url="?curid=227007" title="Lettrism">
<text>Lettrism is a French avant-garde movement, established in Paris in the mid-1940s by Romanian immigrant Isidore Isou. In a body of work totaling hundreds of volumes, Isou and the Lettrists have applied their theories to all areas of art and culture, most notably in poetry, film, painting and political theory. The movement has its theoretical roots in Dada and Surrealism. Isou viewed his fellow countryman Tristan Tzara as the greatest creator and rightful leader of the Dada movement, and dismissed most of the others as plagiarists and falsifiers. Among the Surrealists, André Breton was a significant influence, but Isou was dissatisfied by what he saw as the stagnation and theoretical bankruptcy of the movement as it stood in the 1940s.

In French, the movement is called Lettrisme, from the French word for &quot;letter&quot;, arising from the fact that many of their early works centred on letters and other visual or spoken symbols. The &quot;Lettristes&quot; themselves prefer the spelling &#x27;Letterism&#x27; for the Anglicised term, and this is the form that is used on those rare occasions when they produce or supervise English translations of their writings: however, &#x27;Lettrism&#x27; is at least as common in English usage. The term, having been the original name that was first given to the group, has lingered as a blanket term to cover all of their activities, even as many of these have moved away from any connection to letters. But other names have also been introduced, either for the group as a whole or for its activities in specific domains, such as &#x27;the Isouian movement&#x27;, &#x27;youth uprising&#x27;, &#x27;hypergraphics&#x27;, &#x27;creatics&#x27;, &#x27;infinitesimal art&#x27; and &#x27;excoördism&#x27;.

== History ==
1925. Isidore Goldstein was born at Botoșani, Romania, on 31 January, to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. During the early 1950s, Goldstein would be signing himself &#x27;Jean-Isidore Isou&#x27;; otherwise, it was always &#x27;Isidore Isou&#x27;. &#x27;Isou&#x27; was normally taken to be a pseudonym, but Isou/Goldstein himself resisted this interpretation.

My name is Isou. My mother called me Isou, only it&#x27;s written differently in Romanian. And Goldstein: I&#x27;m not ashamed of my name. At Gallimard, I was known as Isidore Isou Goldstein. Isou, it&#x27;s my name! Only in Romanian it&#x27;s written Izu, but in French it&#x27;s Isou.

=== 1940s ===
*1942–1944. Isou develops the principles of Lettrism, and begins writing the books that he would subsequently publish after his relocation to Paris.
*1945. Aged twenty, Isou arrived in Paris on 23 August after six weeks of clandestine travel. In November, he founded the Letterist movement with Gabriel Pomerand.
*1946. Isou and Pomerand disrupt a performance of Tzara&#x27;s &quot;La Fuite&quot; at the Vieux-Colombier. Publication of &quot;La Dictature Lettriste: cahiers d&#x27;un nouveau régime artistique&quot; (&quot;The Letterist Dictatorship: notebooks of a new artistic regime&quot;). Although announced as the first in a series, only one such notebook would appear. A subtitle proudly boasts of Letterism that it is &#x27;the only contemporary movement of the artistic avant-garde&#x27;.
*1947. Isou&#x27;s first two books are published by Gallimard: &quot;Introduction à une nouvelle poésie et à une nouvelle musique&quot; (&quot;Introduction to a New Poetry and a New Music&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;Agrégation d&#x27;un nom et d&#x27;un messie&quot; (&quot;Aggregation of a Name and a Messiah&quot;). The former sets out Isou&#x27;s theory of the &#x27;amplic&#x27; and &#x27;chiselling&#x27; phases, and, within this framework, presents his views on both the past history and the future direction of poetry and music. The latter is more biographical, discussing the genesis of Isou&#x27;s ideas, as well as exploring Judaism. Isou and Pomerand are joined by François Dufrêne.
*1949. Isou publishes &quot;Isou, ou la mécanique des femmes&quot; (&quot;Isou, or the mechanics of women&quot;), the first of several works of erotology, wherein he claims to have bedded 375 women in the preceding four years, and offers to explain how (p. 9). The book is banned and Isou is briefly imprisoned. Also published, the first of several works on political theory, Isou&#x27;s &quot;Traité d&#x27;économie nucléaire: Le soulèvement de la jeunesse&quot; (&quot;Treatise of Nuclear Economics: Youth Uprising&quot;).

=== 1950s ===
*1950. Maurice Lemaître, Jean-Louis Brau, Gil J. Wolman and Serge Berna join the group. Isou publishes first metagraphic novel, &quot;Les journaux des dieux&quot; (&quot;The Gods&#x27; Diaries&quot;), followed soon afterwards by Pomerand&#x27;s &quot;Saint Ghetto des Prêts&quot; (&quot;Saint Ghetto of the Loans&quot;) and Lemaître&#x27;s &quot;Canailles&quot; (&quot;Scoundrels&quot;). Also, the first manifestos of Letterist painting. Some of the younger Letterists invade Nôtre Dame cathedral at Easter mass, aired live on national TV, to announce to the congregation that God is dead. In a Letterist FAQ published in the first issue of Lemaître&#x27;s journal, &quot;Ur&quot;, CP-Matricon explains: &#x27;The letterists do not create scandals: they break the conspiracy of silence set up by pusillanimous show-offs (journalists) and smash the faces of those who don&#x27;t please them.&#x27; (p. 8).
*1951. Isou completes his first film, &quot;Traité de bave et d&#x27;éternité&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Slime and Eternity&quot;), which will soon be followed by Lemaître&#x27;s &quot;Le film est déjà commencé?&quot; (&quot;Has the film already started?&quot;), Wolman&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Anticoncept&quot; (&quot;The Anticoncept&quot;), Dufrêne&#x27;s &quot;Tambours du jugement premier&quot; (&quot;Drums of the First Judgment&quot;) and Guy Debord&#x27;s &quot;Hurlements en faveur de Sade&quot; (&quot;Howls for de Sade&quot;). Debord joins the group in April when they travel down to Cannes (where he was then living) to show &quot;Traité de bave et d&#x27;éternité&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival. Under the auspices of Jean Cocteau, a prize for &#x27;best avant-garde&#x27; is specially created and awarded to Isou&#x27;s film.
*1952. Publication of the first (and only) issue of &quot;Ion&quot;, devoted to Letterist film. This is significant for including Debord&#x27;s first appearance in print, alongside work from Wolman and Berna who, following an intervention at a Charlie Chaplin press conference at the Hotel Ritz in October, would join him in splitting from Isou&#x27;s group to form the Letterist International.

*1953. Isou moves into photography with &quot;Amos, ou Introduction à la métagraphologie&quot; (&quot;Amos, or Introduction to Metagraphology&quot;), theatre with &quot;Fondements pour la transformation intégrale du théâtre&quot; (&quot;The Foundations of the Integrated Transformation of the Theatre&quot;), painting with &quot;Les nombres&quot; (&quot;The Numbers&quot;), and dance with &quot;Manifeste pour une danse ciselante&quot; (&quot;Manifesto for Chiselling Dance&quot;).
*1955. Dufrêne develops his first &quot;Crirhythmes&quot;.
*1956. Isou introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in &quot;Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire&quot; (&quot;Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics&quot;).
*1958. Columbia Records release the first audio recordings of Letterist poetry, &quot;Maurice Lemaître presente le lettrisme&quot;.

=== 1960s ===
*1960. Isou introduces the concept of supertemporal art in &quot;L&#x27;Art supertemporel&quot;. Asger Jorn publishes a critique of Letterism, &quot;Originality and Magnitude (on the system of Isou)&quot; in issue 4 of &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot;. Isou replies at length in &quot;L&#x27;Internationale Situationniste, un degré plus bas que le jarrivisme et l&#x27;englobant&quot;. This is only the first of many works that Isou will write against Debord (his former protégé) and the Situationist International, which Isou regards as a neo-Nazi organisation. However, as Andrew Hussey reports, his attitude does eventually mellow: &#x27;Now Isou forgave them and he saw (it was crucial, Isou said, that I should understand this!) that they were all on the same side after all.&#x27;
*In the sixties, several new members join group, including Jacques Spacagna (1961), Aude Jessemin (1962), Roberto Altmann (1962), Roland Sabatier (1963), Alain Satié (1964), Micheline Hachette (1964), Francois Poyet (1966), Jean-Paul Curtay (1967), Anton Perich (1967), Gérard-Philippe Broutin (1968).
*1964. Definitive split with Dufrêne and the Ultraletterists, as well as with Wolman who, despite his participation from 1952 to 1957 with the Letterist International (who were forbidden by internal statute from any involvement in Isouian activities), had retained links with Isou&#x27;s group. Dufrêne and Wolman with Brau form the Second Letterist International (&quot;Deuxième internationale lettriste&quot;).
*1967. Lemaître stands for election to the local Parisian legislature, representing the &#x27;Union of Youth and Externity&#x27;. He loses.
*1968. First work on architecture, Isou&#x27;s &quot;Manifeste pour le bouleversement de l&#x27;architecture&quot; (&quot;Manifesto for the Overhaul of Architecture&quot;).

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
General continuation of existing currents, together with new research into psychiatry, mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
*1972 Mike Rose (painter), a German painter, set designer, and writer made acquaintance with the Lettrists and became part of them. He participated in their exhibitions until the 1980s.
Other members to join the lettrism during the seventies : Woody Roehmer, Anne-Catherine Caron, and during the eighties : Frédérique Devaux, Michel Amarger ...

=== 1990s ===
Development of excoordism. Uncomfortable with the direction the group is going in, Lemaître—Isou&#x27;s right-hand man for nearly half a century—begins to distance himself from it. He still continues to pursue traditional Letterist techniques, but now in relative isolation from the main group.

=== 2000s ===
* 2007 Isou dies and The End of the Age of Divinity is published by an anonymous Situationist International member, which claims Isou was the real Mashiach (Messiah).

== Key concepts ==

=== The Amplic (&quot;amplique&quot;) and the Chiselling (&quot;ciselante&quot;) phases ===
Isou first invented these phases through an examination of the history of poetry, but the conceptual apparatus he developed could very easily be applied to most other branches of art and culture. In poetry, he felt that the first amplic phase had been initiated by Homer. In effect, Homer set out a blueprint for what a poem ought to be like. Subsequent poets then developed this blueprint, investigating by means of their work all of the different things that could be done within the Homeric parameters. Eventually, however, everything that &quot;could be&quot; done within that approach &quot;had been&quot; done. In poetry, Isou felt that this point was reached with Victor Hugo (and in painting with Eugène Delacroix, in music with Richard Wagner.). When amplic poetry had been completed, there was simply nothing to be gained by continuing to produce works constructed according to the old model. There would no longer be any genuine creativity or innovation involved, and hence no aesthetic value. This then inaugurated a chiselling phase in the art. Whereas the form had formerly been used as a tool to express things outside its own domain—events, feelings, etc.--it would then turn in on itself and become, perhaps only implicitly, its own subject matter. From Charles Baudelaire to Tristan Tzara (as, in painting, from Manet to Kandinsky; or, in music, from Debussy to Luigi Russolo), subsequent poets would deconstruct the grand edifice of poetry that had been developed over the centuries according to the Homeric model. Finally, when this process of deconstruction had been completed, it would then be time for a new amplic phase to commence. Isou saw himself as the man to show the way. He would take the rubble that remained after the old forms had been shattered, and lay out a new blueprint for reutilising these most basic elements in a radically new way, utterly unlike the poetry of the preceding amplic phase. Isou identified the most basic elements of poetic creation as &quot;letters&quot;—i.e. uninterpreted visual symbols and acoustic sounds—and he set out the parameters for new ways of recombining these ingredients in the name of new aesthetic goals.

=== The &quot;Lettrie&quot; ===
Isou&#x27;s idea for the poem of the future was that it should be purely formal, devoid of all semantic content. The Letterist poem, or &quot;lettrie&quot;, in many ways resembles what certain Italian Futurists (such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti), Russian Futurists (such as Velemir Chlebnikov, Iliazd, or Alexej Kručenych—cf. Zaum), and Dada poets (such as Raoul Hausmann or Kurt Schwitters) had already been doing, and what subsequent sound poets and concrete poets (such as Bob Cobbing, Eduard Ovčáček or Henri Chopin) would later be doing. However, the Letterists were always keen to insist on their own radical originality and to distinguish their work from other ostensibly similar currents.

=== Metagraphics/Hypergraphics ===
On the visual side, the Letterists first gave the name &#x27;metagraphics&#x27; (&quot;metagraphie&quot;) and then &#x27;hypergraphics&#x27; (&quot;hypergraphie&quot;) to their new synthesis of writing and visual art. Some precedents may be seen in Cubist, Dada and Futurist (both Italian and Russian) painting and typographical works, such as Marinetti&#x27;s Zang Tumb Tuum, or in poems such as Apollinaire&#x27;s &quot;Calligrammes&quot; but none of them were a full system like hypergraphy.

=== Letterist film ===
Notwithstanding the considerably more recent origins of film-making, compared to poetry, painting or music, Isou felt in 1950 that its own first amplic phase had already been completed. He therefore set about inaugurating a chiselling phase for the cinema. As he explained in the voiceover to his first film, &quot;Treatise of Slime and Eternity&quot;:

I believe firstly that the cinema is too rich. It is obese. It has reached its limits, its maximum. With the first movement of widening which it will outline, the cinema will burst! Under the blow of a congestion, this &quot;greased pig&quot; will tear into a thousand pieces. I announce the &quot;destruction of the cinema&quot;, the first apocalyptic sign of disjunction, of rupture, of this corpulent and bloated organization which calls itself film.

The two central innovations of Letterist film were: (i) the carving of the image (&quot;la ciselure d&#x27;image&quot;), where the film-maker would deliberately scratch or paint onto the actual film stock itself. Similar techniques are also employed in Letterist still photography. (ii) Discrepant cinema (&quot;le cinéma discrépant&quot;), where the soundtrack and the image-track would be separated, each one telling a different story or pursuing its own more abstract path. The most radical of the Letterist films, Wolman&#x27;s &quot;The Anticoncept&quot; and Debord&#x27;s &quot;Howls for Sade&quot;, went even further, and abandoned images altogether. From a visual point of view, the former consisted simply of a fluctuating ball of light, projected onto a large balloon, while the latter alternated a blank white screen (when there was speech in the soundtrack) and a totally black screen (accompanying ever-increasing periods of total silence). In addition, the Letterists utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of &#x27;détournement&#x27;) in Situationist film. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the &#x27;film-debate&#x27;, directly involve the audience itself in the total experience.

=== Supertemporal art (&quot;L&#x27;art supertemporel&quot;) ===
The supertemporal frame was a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.

=== Infinitesimal art (&quot;Art infinitesimal&quot;) ===
Recalling the infinitesimals of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the Letterists developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Also called &quot;Art esthapériste&quot; (&#x27;infinite-aesthetics&#x27;). Cf. Conceptual Art. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

=== Youth uprising (&quot;Le soulèvement de la jeunesse&quot;) ===
Isou identified the amplic phase of political theory and economics as that of Adam Smith and free trade; its chiselling phase was that of Karl Marx and socialism. Isou termed these &#x27;atomic economics&#x27; and &#x27;molecular economics&#x27; respectively: he launched &#x27;nuclear economics&#x27; as a corrective to both of them. Both currents, he felt, had simply failed to take into account a large part of the population, namely those young people and other &#x27;externs&#x27; who neither produced nor exchanged goods or capital in any significant way. He felt that the creative urge was an integral part of human nature, but that, unless it was properly guided, it could be diverted into crime and anti-social behaviour. The Letterists sought to restructure every aspect of society in such a way as to enable these externs to channel their creativity in more positive ways.

== Major developments of Lettrism ==
* The Letterist International was formed in 1952 by Lettrists Guy Debord, Gil J. Wolman, Jean-Louis Brau and Serge Berna. In 1957, it fused with the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus and the London Psychogeographical Association to create the Situationist International. During its five years, the Letterist International continued to practice the Lettrist technique of metagraphics, although they were quite against hypergraphics, instead developing metagraphics into détournement.
* Ultra-Lettrism arose in 1958, its manifesto appearing in the second issue of &quot;Grammes&quot; in that year, signed by the Lettrists François Dufrêne, Robert Estivals, and Jacques Villeglé. Its members practiced hypergraphics and, with Dufrêne&#x27;s crirhythmes and a greater interest in tape-recording, they sought to push Letterist sound-poetry further than Isou&#x27;s group had done.
* The Second Letterist International was an ephemeral group formed in 1964 by Wolman, Dufrêne and Brau.
* The New Lettrist International, unknown form the original lettrists themselves, was formed in the late 1990s. Although it has no direct connection with the original Letterist group, it has drawn influences both from them and from the Letterist International, as well as from Hurufism (Arabic for &#x27;Letterism&#x27;).

== Key members ==
* Isidore Isou (29 January 1925 – 28 July 2007).
* Gabriel Pomerand (1926–1972), member from 1945.
* François Dufrêne (1930–1982), member from 1947 to 1964. Split to form Ultra-letterism and the Second Letterist International.
* Jan Kubíček (1927–2013), significantly contributing member during the early 1960s.
* Maurice Lemaître (1926–2018), member since 1950, and still actively pursuing his own approach to Letterism.
* Gil J. Wolman (1929–1995), member from 1950 to 1952. Split to form Letterist International 1952-1957], but then returned to occasional participation with Isouian group from 1961 to 1964, before splitting again to form the Second Letterist International.
* Jean-Louis Brau (1930–1985), member from 1950 to 1952. Split to form Letterist International 1952-1957], but then returned to occasional participation with Isouian group from 1961 to 1964, before splitting again to form the Second Letterist International.*
* Guy Debord (1931–1994), member from 1951 to 1952. Split to form Letterist International.
* Anton Perich (1945-), member from 1967 to 1970.

== Influences ==
* Fluxus artist Ben Vautier has openly avowed his indebtedness to Isou: &quot;Isou, I don&#x27;t deny it, was very important for me around 1958 when I first theorized about art. It was thanks to Isou that I realized that what was important in art was not the beautiful, but the new, the creation. In 1962, while reading &quot;L&#x27;agrégation d&#x27;un nom et d&#x27;un messie&quot;, I was fascinated by his ego, his megalomania, his pretences. I said to myself then: there is no art without ego, and this is where my work on the ego is rooted.&quot;
* The German painter, set designer, and writer, Mike Rose, developed techniques close to Letterism during the 1970s and 1980s, and had some contact with the Parisian group.
* The film &quot;Irma Vep&quot; (1996) contains a sequence that evokes the Lettrist aesthetic.
* Michael Jacobson&#x27;s novella &quot;The Giant&#x27;s Fence&quot; (2006) is a hypergraphic work, apparently inspired by the Letterists.

* Pomerand, Gabriel. &quot;Saint Ghetto of the Loans&quot; (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2006).

Maurice Lemaître has privately published translations of a few of his own works, though these are not at all easy to find:

<text>Carenza Rachel Lewis (born 30 November 1963) is a British academic archaeologist and television presenter.

==Early life==
Lewis received her formal education at the private All Hallows Convent School in Norfolk. She studied archaeology and anthropology at Girton College, Cambridge.

==Field and academic career==
In 1985, she joined the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England as a field archaeologist for the Wessex area. During part of her time with the Commission she was seconded to the History Department of the University of Birmingham to research the relationship between settlement and landscape in the East Midlands. She followed this with a similar project in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

Lewis was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1998. In 1999, she was elected a visiting fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where she was a Senior Research Associate and Affiliated Lecturer. In 2004, she took on a new post at Cambridge to promote undergraduate archaeology, and created &quot;Access Cambridge Archaeology&quot;. In 2015, Lewis was appointed to the Professorial Chair of &#x27;Public Understanding of Research&#x27; at the University of Lincoln.

==Television career==
In the early 1990s she joined the team presenting the &quot;Time Team&quot; series, a new television programme designed to make archaeology accessible for the general public, which was first broadcast on Channel 4 Television in 1994. She appeared on the show from 1993 to 2005, appearing in each of the first twelve seasons. The ratings success of the series led to further television presenting commissions for Lewis, including the series &quot;House Detectives&quot; (1997–2002).

In 2000, Lewis presented an episode of the BBC&#x27;s theoretical history programme entitled &quot;What If&quot;, in which she examined the failed revolt of Queen Boudicca and the Iceni against the Roman Empire in AD 60. She also devised and presented a series called &quot;Sacred Sites&quot; for HTV.

In 2010, she appeared in the television series &quot;Michael Wood&#x27;s Story of England&quot;.

In 2022, she rejoined the Time Team crew for its YouTube revival.

==Personal life==
Lewis has three children. In 2000, she appeared in national print media detailing her experiences as one of a number of victims of medical misdiagnosis at the hands of Dr James Elwood in the late 1990s.

<text>An open standard is a standard that is openly accessible and usable by anyone. It is also a common prerequisite that open standards use an open license that provides for extensibility. Typically, anybody can participate in their development due to their inherently open nature. There is no single definition, and interpretations vary with usage. Examples of open standards include the GSM, 4G, and 5G standards that allow most modern mobile phones to work world-wide.

== Definitions ==
The terms &quot;open&quot; and &quot;standard&quot; have a wide range of meanings associated with their usage. There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize different aspects of openness, including the openness of the resulting specification, the openness of the drafting process, and the ownership of rights in the standard. The term &quot;standard&quot; is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis.

The definitions of the term &quot;open standard&quot; used by academics, the European Union, and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark, France, and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use, as do the New Zealand, South African and the Venezuelan governments. On the standard organisation side, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ensures that its specifications can be implemented on a royalty-free basis.

Many definitions of the term &quot;standard&quot; permit patent holders to impose &quot;reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing&quot; royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard. For example, the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and ITU-T permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent licensing fees. Among these organizations, only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as &quot;open standards&quot;, while the others refer only to producing &quot;standards&quot;. The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of &quot;open standard&quot; that allow &quot;reasonable and non-discriminatory&quot; patent licensing fee requirements.

There are those in the open-source software community who hold that an &quot;open standard&quot; is only open if it can be freely adopted, implemented and extended. While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body, it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded. The typical example of &quot;open source&quot; that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel, the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor. There are three others that are most widely accepted as &quot;open&quot; which include the GSM phones (adopted as a government standard), Open Group which promotes UNIX, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP. Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors.

Open standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as open formats.

Many specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary, and only available (if they can be obtained at all) under restrictive contract terms from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification. As such these specifications are not considered to be fully &quot;open&quot;. Joel West has argued that &quot;open&quot; standards are not black and white but have many different levels of &quot;openness&quot;. A more open standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it. This occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the software. Less open standards exist when a particular firm has much power (not ownership) over the standard, which can occur when a firm&#x27;s platform &quot;wins&quot; in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular.

== Specific definitions of an open standard ==

=== Made by standardization bodies ===

==== Joint IEEE, ISOC, W3C, IETF and IAB Definition ====
On August 12, 2012, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Internet Society (ISOC), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB), jointly affirmed a set of principles which have contributed to the exponential growth of the Internet and related technologies. The &quot;OpenStand Principles&quot; define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation. Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open, participatory process, support interoperability, foster global competition, are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers. This drives innovation which, in turn, contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets.

There are five, key OpenStand Principles, as outlined below:

1. Cooperation
Respectful cooperation between standards organizations, whereby each respects the autonomy, integrity, processes, and intellectual property rules of the others.

2. Adherence to Principles – Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development, namely

*Due process: Decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants. No one party dominates or guides standards development. Standards processes are transparent and opportunities exist to appeal decisions. Processes for periodic standards review and updating are well defined.
*Broad consensus: Processes allow for all views to be considered and addressed, such that agreement can be found across a range of interests.
*Transparency: Standards organizations provide advance public notice of proposed standards development activities, the scope of work to be undertaken, and conditions for participation. Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in reaching those decisions are provided. Public comment periods are provided before final standards approval and adoption.
*Balance: Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person, company or interest group.
*Openness: Standards processes are open to all interested and informed parties.

3. Collective Empowerment
Commitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that:

* are chosen and defined based on technical merit, as judged by the contributed expertise of each participant;
* provide global interoperability, scalability, stability, and resiliency;
* enable global competition;
* serve as building blocks for further innovation; and
* contribute to the creation of global communities, benefiting humanity.

4. Availability
Standards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment. Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms. Given market diversity, fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND).

5. Voluntary Adoption
Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market.

==== ITU-T definition ====
The ITU-T is a standards development organization (SDO) that is one of the three sectors of the International Telecommunication Union (a specialized agency of the United Nations). The ITU-T has a Telecommunication Standardization Bureau director&#x27;s &quot;Ad Hoc&quot; group on IPR that produced the following definition in March 2005, which the ITU-T as a whole has endorsed for its purposes since November 2005:
: The ITU-T has a long history of open standards development. However, recently some different external sources have attempted to define the term &quot;Open Standard&quot; in a variety of different ways. In order to avoid confusion, the ITU-T uses for its purpose the term &quot;Open Standards&quot; per the following definition:
: &quot;Open Standards&quot; are standards made available to the general public and are developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process. &quot;Open Standards&quot; facilitate interoperability and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption.
: Other elements of &quot;Open Standards&quot; include, but are not limited to:
:*Collaborative process – voluntary and market driven development (or approval) following a transparent consensus driven process that is reasonably open to all interested parties.
:* Reasonably balanced – ensures that the process is not dominated by any one interest group.
:* Due process – includes consideration of and response to comments by interested parties.
:* Intellectual property rights (IPRs) – IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation). Negotiations are left to the parties concerned and are performed outside the SDO.
:* Quality and level of detail – sufficient to permit the development of a variety of competing implementations of interoperable products or services. Standardized interfaces are not hidden, or controlled other than by the SDO promulgating the standard.
:* Publicly available – easily available for implementation and use, at a reasonable price. Publication of the text of a standard by others is permitted only with the prior approval of the SDO.
:* On-going support – maintained and supported over a long period of time.

The ITU-T, ITU-R, ISO, and IEC have harmonized on a common patent policy under the banner of the WSC. However, the ITU-T definition should not necessarily be considered also applicable in ITU-R, ISO and IEC contexts, since the Common Patent Policy 
does not make any reference to &quot;open standards&quot; but rather only to &quot;standards.&quot;

==== IETF definition ====
In section 7 of its RFC 2026, the IETF classifies specifications that have been developed in a manner similar to that of the IETF itself as being &quot;open standards,&quot; and lists the standards produced by ANSI, ISO, IEEE, and ITU-T as examples. As the IETF standardization processes and IPR policies have the characteristics listed above by ITU-T, the IETF standards fulfill the ITU-T definition of &quot;open standards.&quot;

However, the IETF has not adopted a specific definition of &quot;open standard&quot;; both RFC 2026 and the IETF&#x27;s mission statement (RFC 3935) talks about &quot;open process,&quot; but RFC 2026 does not define &quot;open standard&quot; except for the purpose of defining what documents IETF standards can link to.

RFC 2026 belongs to a set of RFCs collectively known as BCP 9 (Best Common Practice, an IETF policy).
RFC 2026 was later updated by BCP 78 and 79 (among others). As of 2011 BCP 78 is RFC 5378 (Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust), and BCP 79 consists of RFC 3979 (Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology) and a clarification in RFC 4879. The changes are intended to be compatible with the &quot;Simplified BSD License&quot; as stated in the IETF Trust Legal Provisions and Copyright FAQ based on RFC 5377.

In August 2012, the IETF combined with the W3C and IEEE to launch OpenStand and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards. This captures &quot;the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce&quot;. The declaration is then published in the form of RFC 6852 in January 2013.

=== By legislative or governmental bodies ===

==== European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services ====
The European Union defined the term for use within its European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services, Version 1.0 although it does not claim to be a universal definition for all European Union use and documentation.
To reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services, guidance needs to focus on open standards.
The word &quot;open&quot; is here meant in the sense of fulfilling the following requirements:

* The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization, and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties (consensus or majority decision etc.).
* The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge. It must be permissible to all to copy, distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee.
* The intellectual property – i.e. patents possibly present – of (parts of) the standard is made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis.
* There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard
==== Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium definition ====
The Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC) defines open standard as the following:
Specifications for hardware and/or software that are publicly available implying that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the features and performance of their products. It also implies that the existing open system can be removed and replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption.
==== Danish government definition ====
The Danish government has attempted to make a definition of open standards, 
which also is used in pan-European software development projects. It states:
* An open standard is accessible to everyone free of charge (i.e. there is no discrimination between users, and no payment or other considerations are required as a condition of use of the standard)
* An open standard of necessity remains accessible and free of charge (i.e. owners renounce their options, if indeed such exist, to limit access to the standard at a later date, for example, by committing themselves to openness during the remainder of a possible patent&#x27;s life)
*An open standard is accessible free of charge and documented in all its details (i.e. all aspects of the standard are transparent and documented, and both access to and use of the documentation is free)
==== French law definition ====
The French Parliament approved a definition of &quot;open standard&quot; in its &quot;Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy.&quot; The definition is (Article 4):
* By open standard is understood any communication, interconnection or interchange protocol, and any interoperable data format whose specifications are public and without any restriction in their access or implementation.
==== Indian Government Definition ====

A clear royalty-free stance and far reaching requirements case is the one for India&#x27;s Government

==== Italian Law definition ====

Italy has a general rule for the entire public sector dealing with Open Standards, although concentrating on data formats, in Art. 68 of the Code of the Digital Administration (&quot;Codice dell&#x27;Amministrazione Digitale&quot;)

[applications must] allow representation of data under different formats, at least one being an open data format.

[it is defined] an open data format, a data format which is made public, is thoroughly documented and neutral with regard to the technological tools needed to peruse the same data.
==== New Zealand official interoperability framework definition ====
The E-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF) defines open standard as royalty-free according to the following text:
While a universally agreed definition of &quot;open standards&quot; is unlikely to be
resolved in the near future, the e-GIF accepts that a definition of &quot;open standards&quot;
needs to recognise a continuum that ranges from closed to open, and encompasses
varying degrees of &quot;openness.&quot; To guide readers in this respect, the e-GIF
endorses &quot;open standards&quot; that exhibit the following properties:

* Be accessible to everyone free of charge: no discrimination between users, and no payment or other considerations should be required as a condition to use the standard.
* Remain accessible to everyone free of charge: owners should renounce their options, if any, to limit access to the standard at a later date.
* Be documented in all its details: all aspects of the standard should be transparent and documented, and both access to and use of the documentation should be free.

The e-GIF performs the same function in e-government as the Road Code does on
the highways. Driving would be excessively costly, inefficient, and ineffective if
road rules had to be agreed each time one vehicle encountered another.
==== Portuguese law definition ====
The Portuguese Open Standards Law, adopted in 2011, demands the use of Open Standards, and is applicable to sovereign entities, central public administration services (including decentralized services and public institutes), regional public administration services and the public sector. In it, Open Standards are defined thus:
a) Its adoption is fruit off an open decision process accessible to all interested parties;

b) The specifications document must have been freely published, allowing its copy, distribution and use without restrictions;

c) The specifications document cannot cover undocumented actions of processes;

d) The applicable intellectual property rights, including patents, have been made available in a full, irrevocable and irreversible way to the Portuguese State;

e) There are no restrictions to its implementation.
==== Spanish law definition ====
A Law passed by the Spanish Parliament requires that all electronic services provided by the Spanish public administration must be based on open standards. It defines an open standard as royalty-free, according to the following definition (ANEXO Definiciones k):
An open standard fulfills the following conditions:
* it is public, and its use is available on a free [gratis] basis, or at a cost that does not imply a difficulty for the user.
* its use is not subject to the payment of any intellectual [copyright] or industrial [patents and trademarks] property right.
==== South African Government definition ====
The South African Government approved a definition in the &quot;Minimum Interoperability Operating Standards Handbook&quot; (MIOS).

For the purposes of the MIOS, a standard shall be considered open if it meets all of these criteria. There are standards which we are obliged to adopt for pragmatic reasons which do not necessarily fully conform to being open in all respects. In such cases, where an open standard does not yet exist, the degree of openness will be taken into account when selecting an appropriate standard:

#it should be maintained by a non-commercial organization
#participation in the ongoing development work is based on decision-making processes that are open to all interested parties.
#open access: all may access committee documents, drafts and completed standards free of cost or for a negligible fee.
#It must be possible for everyone to copy, distribute and use the standard free of cost.
#The intellectual rights required to implement the standard (e.g.essential patent claims) are irrevocably available, without any royalties attached.
#There are no reservations regarding reuse of the standard.
#There are multiple implementations of the standard.

====UK government definition====
The UK government&#x27;s definition of open standards applies to software interoperability, data and document formats. The criteria for open standards are published in the &quot;Open Standards Principles&quot; policy paper and are as follows.

#Collaboration – the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties.
#Transparency – the decision-making process is transparent, and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process.
#Due process – the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation, or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality.
#Fair access – the standard is well documented, publicly available and free to use.
#Mature – completely developed, unless they are in the context of creating innovative solutions.
#Independent of platform, application and vendor – supported by the market with several implementations.
#Rights – rights essential to implementation of the standard, and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard, are licensed on a royalty-free basis that is compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions. These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions.
The Cabinet Office in the UK recommends that government departments specify requirements using open standards when undertaking procurement exercises in order to promote interoperability and re-use, and avoid technological lock-in.

==== Venezuelan law definition ====
The Venezuelan Government approved a &quot;free software and open standards law.&quot; 
The decree includes the requirement that the Venezuelan public sector must use free software based on open standards, and includes a definition of open standard:
Article 2: for the purposes of this Decree, it shall be understood as

k) Open standards: technical specifications, published and controlled by an organization in charge of their development, that have been accepted by the industry, available to everybody for their implementation in free software or other [type of software], promoting competitivity, interoperability and flexibility.
=== By recognized persons ===
==== Bruce Perens&#x27; definition ====
One of the most popular definitions of the term &quot;open standard&quot;, as measured by Google ranking, is the one developed by Bruce Perens.
His definition lists a set of principles that he believes must be met by an open standard:

#Availability: Open Standards are available for all to read and implement.
#Maximize End-User Choice: Open Standards create a fair, competitive market for implementations of the standard. They do not lock the customer into a particular vendor or group.
#No Royalty: Open Standards are free for all to &quot;implement&quot;, with no royalty or fee. &quot;Certification&quot; of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee.
#No Discrimination: Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor&#x27;s implementation. Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated, but may also provide enhanced certification services.
#Extension or Subset: Implementations of Open Standards may be extended, or offered in subset form. However, certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations, and may place requirements upon extensions (see &quot;Predatory Practices&quot;).
#Predatory Practices: Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by &quot;embrace-and-extend&quot; tactics. The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions, and a license for all others to create, distribute, and sell software that is compatible with the extensions. An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions.

Bruce Perens goes on to explain further the points in the standard in practice. With regard to availability, he states that &quot;any software project should be able to afford a copy without undue hardship. The cost should not far exceed the cost of a college textbook&quot;.

==== Ken Krechmer&#x27;s definition ====
Ken Krechmer identifies ten &quot;rights&quot;:

#Open Meeting
#Consensus
#Due Process
#Open IPR
#One World
#Open Change
#Open Documents
#Open Interface
#Open Use
#On-going Support

=== By companies ===
==== Microsoft&#x27;s definition ====

Vijay Kapoor, national technology officer, Microsoft, defines what open standards are as follows:
Let&#x27;s look at what an open standard means: &#x27;open&#x27; refers to it being royalty-free, while &#x27;standard&#x27; means a technology approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis. An open standard is publicly available, and developed, approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process.
Overall, Microsoft&#x27;s relationship to open standards was, at best, mixed. While Microsoft participated in the most significant standard-setting organizations that establish open standards, it was often seen as oppositional to their adoption.

=== By non-profit organizations ===
==== Open Source Initiative&#x27;s definition ====
The Open Source Initiative defines the requirements and criteria for open standards as follows:

The Requirement

An &quot;open standard&quot; must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software.

The Criteria

To comply with the Open Standards Requirement, an &quot;open standard&quot; must satisfy the following criteria. If an &quot;open standard&quot; does not meet these criteria, it will be discriminating against open source developers.

# No Intentional Secrets: The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation. As flaws are inevitable, the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR.
# Availability: The standard MUST be freely and publicly available (e.g., from a stable web site) under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost.
# Patents: All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST:
#* be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use, or
#* be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software
# No Agreements: There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement, NDA, grant, click-through, or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard.
# No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies: Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement.

==== World Wide Web Consortium&#x27;s definition ====
As a provider of Web technology ICT Standards, notably XML, http, HTML, CSS and WAI, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) follows a process that promotes the development of quality standards.

Looking at the result, the spec alone, up for adoption, is not enough. The participative/inclusive process leading to a particular design, and the supporting resources available with it should be accounted when we talk about Open Standards:
*transparency (due process is public, and all technical discussions, meeting minutes, are archived and referencable in decision making)
*relevance (new standardization is started upon due analysis of the market needs, including requirements phase, e.g. accessibility, multi-linguism)
*openness (anybody can participate, and everybody does: industry, individual, public, government bodies, academia, on a worldwide scale)
*impartiality and consensus (guaranteed fairness by the process and the neutral hosting of the W3C organization, with equal weight for each participant)
*availability (free access to the standard text, both during development, at final stage, and for translations, and assurance that core Web and Internet technologies can be implemented Royalty-Free)
*maintenance (ongoing process for testing, errata, revision, permanent access, validation, etc.)
In August 2012, the W3C combined with the IETF and IEEE to launch OpenStand and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards. This captures &quot;the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce&quot;.

==== Digital Standards Organization definition ====

The Digital Standards Organization (DIGISTAN) states that &quot;an open standard must be aimed at creating unrestricted competition between vendors and unrestricted choice for users.&quot; Its brief definition of &quot;open standard&quot; (or &quot;free and open standard&quot;) is &quot;a published specification that is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle.&quot; Its more complete definition as follows:
* &quot;The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organization, and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties.
* The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available freely. It must be permissible to all to copy, distribute, and use it freely.
* The patents possibly present on (parts of) the standard are made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis.
* There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard.

A key defining property is that an open standard is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle. Immunity from vendor capture makes it possible to improve upon, trust, and extend an open standard over time.&quot;
This definition is based on the EU&#x27;s EIF v1 definition of &quot;open standard,&quot; but with changes to address what it terms as &quot;vendor capture.&quot; They believe that &quot;Many groups and individuals have provided definitions for &#x27;open standard&#x27; that reflect their economic interests in the standards process. We see that the fundamental conflict is between vendors who seek to capture markets and raise costs, and the market at large, which seeks freedom and lower costs... Vendors work hard to turn open standards into franchise standards. They work to change the statutory language so they can cloak franchise standards in the sheep&#x27;s clothing of &#x27;open standard.&#x27; A robust definition of &quot;free and open standard&quot; must thus take into account the direct economic conflict between vendors and the market at large.&quot;

==== Free Software Foundation Europe&#x27;s definition ====

The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) uses a definition which is based on the European Interoperability Framework v.1, and was extended after consultation with industry and community stakeholders. FSFE&#x27;s standard has been adopted by groups such as the SELF EU Project, the 2008 Geneva Declaration on Standards and the Future of the Internet, and international Document Freedom Day teams.

According to this definition an Open Standard is a format or protocol that is:

# Subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties;
# Without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves;
# Free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model;
# Managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties;
# Available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors, or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties.

==== FFII&#x27;s definition ====

The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure&#x27;s definition is said to coincide with the definition issued in the European Interoperability Framework released in 2004.
A specification that is public, the standard is inclusive and it has been developed and is maintained in an open standardization process, everybody can implement it without any restriction, neither payment, to license the IPR (granted to everybody for free and without any condition). This is the minimum license terms asked by standardization bodies as W3C. Of course, all the other bodies accept open standards. But specification itself could cost a fair amount of money (i.e. 100–400 Eur per copy as in ISO because copyright and publication of the document itself).

==Patents==
In 2002 and 2003 the controversy about using reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) licensing for the use of patented technology in web standards increased. Bruce Perens, important associations as FSF or FFII and others have argued that the use of patents restricts who can implement a standard to those able or willing to pay for the use of the patented technology. The requirement to pay some small amount per user, is often an insurmountable problem for free/open source software implementations which can be redistributed by anyone. Royalty-free (RF) licensing is generally the only possible license for free/open source software implementations. Version 3 of the GNU General Public License includes a section that enjoins anyone who distributes a program released under the GPL from enforcing patents on subsequent users of the software or derivative works.

One result of this controversy was that many governments (including the Danish, French and Spanish governments singly and the EU collectively) specifically affirmed that &quot;open standards&quot; required royalty-free licenses. Some standards organizations, such as the W3C, modified their processes to essentially only permit royalty-free licensing.

Patents for software, formulas and algorithms are currently enforceable in the US but not in the EU. The European Patent Convention expressly prohibits algorithms, business methods and software from being covered by patents. The US has only allowed them since 1989 and there has been growing controversy in recent years as to either the benefit or feasibility.

A standards body and its associated processes cannot &quot;force&quot; a patent holder to give up its right to charge license fees, especially if the company concerned is not a member of the standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process. In fact, this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an &quot;open&quot; approach, fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members. Few bodies will carry out (or require their members to carry out) a full patent search. Ultimately, the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard, try to rework around it, or work to invalidate the patent. Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group, and this is generally considered enforceable.

Examples of patent claims brought against standards previously thought to be open include JPEG and the Rambus case over DDR SDRAM. The H.264 video codec is an example of a standards organization producing a standard that has known, non-royalty-free required patents.

Often the scope of the standard itself determines how likely it is that a firm will be able to use a standard as patent-like protection. Richard Langlois argues that standards with a wide scope may offer a firm some level of protection from competitors but it is likely that Schumpeterian creative destruction will ultimately leave the firm open to being &quot;invented around&quot; regardless of the standard a firm may benefit from.

==Quotes==
* EU Commissioner Erkki Liikanen: &quot;Open standards are important to help create interoperable and affordable solutions for everybody. They also promote competition by setting up a technical playing field that is level to all market players. This means lower costs for enterprises and, ultimately, the consumer.&quot; (World Standards Day, 14 October 2003) 
* Jorma Ollila, Chairman of Nokia&#x27;s Board of Directors: &quot;... Open standards and platforms create a foundation for success. They enable interoperability of technologies and encourage innovativeness and healthy competition, which in turn increases consumer choice and opens entirely new markets,&quot;
* W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee: &quot;The decision to make the Web an open system was necessary for it to be universal. You can&#x27;t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.&quot;
*In the opening address of The Southern African Telecommunications Networks and Applications Conference (SATNAC) 2005, then Minister of Science and Technology, Mosibudi Mangena stressed need for open standards in ICT:

<text>Computer Go is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to creating a computer program that plays the traditional board game Go. The field is sharply divided into two eras. Before 2015, the programs of the era were weak. The best efforts of the 1980s and 1990s produced only AIs that could be defeated by beginners, and AIs of the early 2000s were intermediate level at best. Professionals could defeat these programs even given handicaps of 10+ stones in favor of the AI. Many of the algorithms such as alpha-beta minimax that performed well as AIs for checkers and chess fell apart on Go&#x27;s 19x19 board, as there were too many branching possibilities to consider. Creation of a human professional quality program with the techniques and hardware of the time was out of reach. Some AI researchers speculated that the problem was unsolvable without creation of human-like AI.

The application of Monte Carlo tree search to Go algorithms provided a notable improvement in the late 2000s decade, with programs finally able to achieve a low-dan level: that of an advanced amateur. High-dan amateurs and professionals could still exploit these programs&#x27; weaknesses and win consistently, but computer performance had advanced past the intermediate (single-digit &quot;kyu&quot;) level. The tantalizing unmet goal of defeating the best human players without a handicap, long thought unreachable, brought a burst of renewed interest. The key insight proved to be an application of machine learning and deep learning. DeepMind, a Google acquisition dedicated to AI research, produced AlphaGo in 2015 and announced it to the world in 2016. AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, a 9 dan professional, in a no-handicap match in 2016, then defeated Ke Jie in 2017, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years. Just as checkers had fallen to machines in 1995 and chess in 1997, computer programs finally conquered humanity&#x27;s greatest Go champions in 2016–2017. DeepMind did not release AlphaGo for public use, but various programs have been built since based on the journal articles DeepMind released describing AlphaGo and its variants.

== Overview and history ==
Professional Go players see the game as requiring intuition, creative and strategic thinking. It has long been considered a difficult challenge in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and is considerably more difficult to solve than chess. Many in the field considered Go to require more elements that mimic human thought than chess. Mathematician I. J. Good wrote in 1965:

Prior to 2015, the best Go programs only managed to reach amateur dan level. On the small 9×9 board, the computer fared better, and some programs managed to win a fraction of their 9×9 games against professional players. Prior to AlphaGo, some researchers had claimed that computers would never defeat top humans at Go.

=== Early decades ===

The first Go program was written by Albert Lindsey Zobrist in 1968 as part of his thesis on pattern recognition. It introduced an influence function to estimate territory and Zobrist hashing to detect ko.

In April 1981, Jonathan K Millen published an article in &quot;Byte&quot; discussing Wally, a Go program with a 15x15 board that fit within the KIM-1 microcomputer&#x27;s 1K RAM. Bruce F. Webster published an article in the magazine in November 1984 discussing a Go program he had written for the Apple Macintosh, including the MacFORTH source. Programs for Go were weak; a 1983 article estimated that they were at best equivalent to 20 &quot;kyu&quot;, the rating of a naive novice player, and often restricted themselves to smaller boards. AIs who played on the Internet Go Server (IGS) on 19x19 size boards had around 20–15 &quot;kyu&quot; strength in 2003, after substantial improvements in hardware.

In 1998, very strong players were able to beat computer programs while giving handicaps of 25–30 stones, an enormous handicap that few human players would ever take. There was a case in the 1994 World Computer Go Championship where the winning program, Go Intellect, lost all three games against the youth players while receiving a 15-stone handicap. In general, players who understood and exploited a program&#x27;s weaknesses could win even through large handicaps.

=== 2007–2014: Monte Carlo tree search ===
In 2006 (with an article published in 2007), Rémi Coulom produced a new algorithm he called Monte Carlo tree search. In it, a game tree is created as usual of potential futures that branch with every move. However, computers &quot;score&quot; a terminal leaf of the tree by repeated random playouts (similar to Monte Carlo strategies for other problems). The advantage is that such random playouts can be done very quickly. The intuitive objection - that random playouts do not correspond to the actual worth of a position - turned out not to be as fatal to the procedure as expected; the &quot;tree search&quot; side of the algorithm corrected well enough for finding reasonable future game trees to explore. Programs based on this method such as MoGo and Fuego saw better performance than classic AIs from earlier. The best programs could do especially well on the small 9x9 board, which had fewer possibilities to explore. In 2009, the first such programs appeared which could reach and hold low dan-level ranks on the KGS Go Server on the 19x19 board.

In 2010, at the 2010 European Go Congress in Finland, MogoTW played 19x19 Go against Catalin Taranu (5p). MogoTW received a seven-stone handicap and won.

In 2011, Zen reached 5 dan on the server KGS, playing games of 15 seconds per move. The account which reached that rank uses a cluster version of Zen running on a 26-core machine.

In 2012, Zen beat Takemiya Masaki (9p) by 11 points at five stones handicap, followed by a 20-point win at four stones handicap.

In 2013, Crazy Stone beat Yoshio Ishida (9p) in a 19×19 game at four stones handicap.

The 2014 Codecentric Go Challenge, a best-of-five match in an even 19x19 game, was played between Crazy Stone and Franz-Jozef Dickhut (6d). No stronger player had ever before agreed to play a serious competition against a go program on even terms. Franz-Jozef Dickhut won, though Crazy Stone won the first match by 1.5 points.

=== 2015 onwards: The deep learning era ===
AlphaGo, developed by Google DeepMind, was a significant advance in computer strength compared to previous Go programs. It used techniques that combined deep learning and Monte Carlo tree search. In October 2015, it defeated Fan Hui, the European Go champion, five times out of five in tournament conditions. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in the first three of five matches. This was the first time that a 9-dan master had played a professional game against a computer without handicap. Lee won the fourth match, describing his win as &quot;invaluable&quot;. AlphaGo won the final match two days later. With this victory, AlphaGo became the first program to beat a 9 dan human professional in a game without handicaps on a full-sized board.

In May 2017, AlphaGo beat Ke Jie, who at the time was ranked top in the world, in a three-game match during the Future of Go Summit.

In October 2017, DeepMind revealed a new version of AlphaGo, trained only through self play, that had surpassed all previous versions, beating the Ke Jie version in 89 out of 100 games.

After the basic principles of AlphaGo were published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, other teams have been able to produce high-level programs. Work on Go AI since has largely consisted of emulating the techniques used to build AlphaGo, which proved so much stronger than everything else. By 2017, both Zen and Tencent&#x27;s project Fine Art were capable of defeating very high-level professionals some of the time. The open source Leela Zero engine was created as well.

== Challenges for strategy and performance for classic AIs ==

For a long time, it was a widely held opinion that computer Go posed a problem fundamentally different from computer chess. Many considered a strong Go-playing program something that could be achieved only in the far future, as a result of fundamental advances in general artificial intelligence technology. Those who thought the problem feasible believed that domain knowledge would be required to be effective against human experts. Therefore, a large part of the computer Go development effort was during these times focused on ways of representing human-like expert knowledge and combining this with local search to answer questions of a tactical nature. The result of this were programs that handled many specific situations well but which had very pronounced weaknesses in their overall handling of the game. Also, these classical programs gained almost nothing from increases in available computing power. Progress in the field was generally slow.

;Size of board 
The large board (19×19, 361 intersections) is often noted as one of the primary reasons why a strong program is hard to create. The large board size prevents an alpha-beta searcher from achieving deep look-ahead without significant search extensions or pruning heuristics.

In 2002, a computer program called MIGOS (MIni GO Solver) completely solved the game of Go for the 5×5 board. Black wins, taking the whole board.

;Number of move options
Continuing the comparison to chess, Go moves are not as limited by the rules of the game. For the first move in chess, the player has twenty choices. Go players begin with a choice of 55 distinct legal moves, accounting for symmetry. This number rises quickly as symmetry is broken, and soon almost all of the 361 points of the board must be evaluated.

;Evaluation function
One of the most basic tasks in a game is to assess a board position: which side is favored, and by how much? In chess, many future positions in a tree are direct wins for one side, and boards have a reasonable heuristic for evaluation in simple material counting, as well as certain positional factors such as pawn structure. A future where one side has lost their queen for no benefit clearly favors the other side. These types of positional evaluation rules cannot efficiently be applied to Go. The value of a Go position depends on a complex analysis to determine whether or not the group is alive, which stones can be connected to one another, and heuristics around the extent to which a strong position has influence, or the extent to which a weak position can be attacked. A stone placed might not have immediate influence, but after many moves could become highly important in retrospect as other areas of the board take shape.

Poor evaluation of board states will cause the AI to work toward positions it incorrectly believes favor it, but actually do not.

;Life and death
One of the main concerns for a Go player is which groups of stones can be kept alive and which can be captured. This general class of problems is known as life and death. Knowledge-based AI systems sometimes attempted to understand the life and death status of groups on the board. The most direct approach is to perform a tree search on the moves which potentially affect the stones in question, and then to record the status of the stones at the end of the main line of play. However, within time and memory constraints, it is not generally possible to determine with complete accuracy which moves could affect the &#x27;life&#x27; of a group of stones. This implies that some heuristic must be applied to select which moves to consider. The net effect is that for any given program, there is a trade-off between playing speed and life and death reading abilities.

== State representation ==
An issue that all Go programs must tackle is how to represent the current state of the game. The most direct way of representing a board is as a one- or two-dimensional array, where elements in the array represent points on the board, and can take on a value corresponding to a white stone, a black stone, or an empty intersection. Additional data is needed to store how many stones have been captured, whose turn it is, and which intersections are illegal due to the Ko rule. In general, machine learning programs stop there at this simplest form and let the organic AIs come to their own understanding of the meaning of the board, likely simply using Monte Carlo playouts to &quot;score&quot; a board as good or bad for a player. &quot;Classic&quot; AI programs that attempted to directly model a human&#x27;s strategy might go further, however, such as layering on data such as stones believed to be dead, stones that are unconditionally alive, stones in a &quot;seki&quot; state of mutual life, and so forth in their representation of the state of the game.

== System design ==
Historically, symbolic artificial intelligence techniques have been used to approach the problem of Go AI. Neural networks began to be tried as an alternative approach in the 2000s decade, as they required immense computing power that was expensive-to-impossible to reach in earlier decades. These approaches attempt to mitigate the problems of the game of Go having a high branching factor and numerous other difficulties.

The only choice a program needs to make is where to place its next stone. However, this decision is made difficult by the wide range of impacts a single stone can have across the entire board, and the complex interactions various stones&#x27; groups can have with each other. Various architectures have arisen for handling this problem. Popular techniques and design philosophies include:
* some form of tree search,
* pattern matching and knowledge-based systems, 
* the application of Monte Carlo methods,
* the use of machine learning.

=== Minimax tree search ===
One traditional AI technique for creating game playing software is to use a minimax tree search. This involves playing out all hypothetical moves on the board up to a certain point, then using an evaluation function to estimate the value of that position for the current player. The move which leads to the best hypothetical board is selected, and the process is repeated each turn. While tree searches have been very effective in computer chess, they have seen less success in Computer Go programs. This is partly because it has traditionally been difficult to create an effective evaluation function for a Go board, and partly because the large number of possible moves each side can make each leads to a high branching factor. This makes this technique very computationally expensive. Because of this, many programs which use search trees extensively can only play on the smaller 9×9 board, rather than full 19×19 ones.

There are several techniques, which can greatly improve the performance of search trees in terms of both speed and memory. Pruning techniques such as alpha–beta pruning, Principal Variation Search, and MTD(f) can reduce the effective branching factor without loss of strength. In tactical areas such as life and death, Go is particularly amenable to caching techniques such as transposition tables. These can reduce the amount of repeated effort, especially when combined with an iterative deepening approach. In order to quickly store a full-sized Go board in a transposition table, a hashing technique for mathematically summarizing is generally necessary. Zobrist hashing is very popular in Go programs because it has low collision rates, and can be iteratively updated at each move with just two XORs, rather than being calculated from scratch. Even using these performance-enhancing techniques, full tree searches on a full-sized board are still prohibitively slow. Searches can be sped up by using large amounts of domain specific pruning techniques, such as not considering moves where your opponent is already strong, and selective extensions like always considering moves next to groups of stones which are about to be captured. However, both of these options introduce a significant risk of not considering a vital move which would have changed the course of the game.

Results of computer competitions show that pattern matching techniques for choosing a handful of appropriate moves combined with fast localized tactical searches (explained above) were once sufficient to produce a competitive program. For example, GNU Go was competitive until 2008.

=== Knowledge-based systems ===
Human novices often learn from the game records of old games played by master players. AI work in the 1990s often involved attempting to &quot;teach&quot; the AI human-style heuristics of Go knowledge. In 1996, Tim Klinger and David Mechner acknowledged the beginner-level strength of the best AIs and argued that &quot;it is our belief that with better tools for representing and maintaining Go knowledge, it will be possible to develop stronger Go programs.&quot; They proposed two ways: recognizing common configurations of stones and their positions and concentrating on local battles. In 2001, one paper concluded that &quot;Go programs are still lacking in both quality and quantity of knowledge,&quot; and that fixing this would improve Go AI performance.

In theory, the use of expert knowledge would improve Go software. Hundreds of guidelines and rules of thumb for strong play have been formulated by both high-level amateurs and professionals. The programmer&#x27;s task is to take these heuristics, formalize them into computer code, and utilize pattern matching and pattern recognition algorithms to recognize when these rules apply. It is also important to be able to &quot;score&quot; these heuristics so that when they offer conflicting advice, the system has ways to determine which heuristic is more important and applicable to the situation. Most of the relatively successful results come from programmers&#x27; individual skills at Go and their personal conjectures about Go, but not from formal mathematical assertions; they are trying to make the computer mimic the way they play Go. Competitive programs around 2001 could contain 50–100 modules that dealt with different aspects and strategies of the game, such as joseki.

Some examples of programs which have relied heavily on expert knowledge are Handtalk (later known as Goemate), The Many Faces of Go, Go Intellect, and Go++, each of which has at some point been considered the world&#x27;s best Go program. However, these methods ultimately had diminishing returns, and never really advanced past an intermediate level at best on a full-sized board. One particular problem was overall game strategy. Even if an expert system recognizes a pattern and knows how to play a local skirmish, it may miss a looming deeper strategic problem in the future. The result is a program whose strength is less than the sum of its parts; while moves may be good on an individual tactical basis, the program can be tricked and maneuvered into ceding too much in exchange, and find itself in an overall losing position. As the 2001 survey put it, &quot;just one bad move can ruin a good game. Program performance over a full game can be much lower than master level.&quot;

=== Monte-Carlo methods ===

One major alternative to using hand-coded knowledge and searches is the use of Monte Carlo methods. This is done by generating a list of potential moves, and for each move playing out thousands of games at random on the resulting board. The move which leads to the best set of random games for the current player is chosen as the best move. No potentially fallible knowledge-based system is required. However, because the moves used for evaluation are generated at random it is possible that a move which would be excellent except for one specific opponent response would be mistakenly evaluated as a good move. The result of this are programs which are strong in an overall strategic sense, but are imperfect tactically. This problem can be mitigated by adding some domain knowledge in the move generation and a greater level of search depth on top of the random evolution. Some programs which use Monte-Carlo techniques are Fuego, The Many Faces of Go v12, Leela, MoGo, Crazy Stone, MyGoFriend, and Zen.

In 2006, a new search technique, &quot;upper confidence bounds applied to trees&quot; (UCT), was developed and applied to many 9x9 Monte-Carlo Go programs with excellent results. UCT uses the results of the &quot;play outs&quot; collected so far to guide the search along the more successful lines of play, while still allowing alternative lines to be explored. The UCT technique along with many other optimizations for playing on the larger 19x19 board has led MoGo to become one of the strongest research programs. Successful early applications of UCT methods to 19x19 Go include MoGo, Crazy Stone, and Mango. MoGo won the 2007 Computer Olympiad and won one (out of three) blitz game against Guo Juan, 5th Dan Pro, in the much less complex 9x9 Go. The Many Faces of Go won the 2008 Computer Olympiad after adding UCT search to its traditional knowledge-based engine.

Monte-Carlo based Go engines have a reputation of being much more willing to play &quot;tenuki&quot;, moves elsewhere on the board, rather than continue a local fight than human players. This was often perceived as a weakness early in these program&#x27;s existence. That said, this tendency has persisted in AlphaGo&#x27;s playstyle with dominant results, so this may be more of a &quot;quirk&quot; than a &quot;weakness.&quot;

=== Machine learning ===
The skill level of knowledge-based systems is closely linked to the knowledge of their programmers and associated domain experts. This limitation has made it difficult to program truly strong AIs. A different path is to use machine learning techniques. In these, the only thing that the programmers need to program are the rules and simple scoring algorithms of how to analyze the worth of a position. The software will then automatically generates its own sense of patterns, heuristics, and strategies, in theory.

This is generally done by allowing a neural network or genetic algorithm to either review a large database of professional games, or play many games against itself or other people or programs. These algorithms are then able to utilize this data as a means of improving their performance. Machine learning techniques can also be used in a less ambitious context to tune specific parameters of programs that rely mainly on other techniques. For example, Crazy Stone learns move generation patterns from several hundred sample games, using a generalization of the Elo rating system.

The most famous example of this approach is AlphaGo, which proved far more effective than previous AIs. In its first version, it had one layer that analyzed millions of existing positions to determine likely moves to prioritize as worthy of further analysis, and another layer that tried to optimize its own winning chances using the suggested likely moves from the first layer. AlphaGo used Monte Carlo tree search to score the resulting positions. A later version of AlphaGo, AlphaGoZero, eschewed learning from existing Go games, and instead learnt only from playing itself repeatedly. Other earlier programs using neural nets include NeuroGo and WinHonte.

== Computer Go and other fields==
Computer Go research results are being applied to other similar fields such as cognitive science, pattern recognition and machine learning. Combinatorial Game Theory, a branch of applied mathematics, is a topic relevant to computer Go. 

John H. Conway suggested applying surreal numbers to analysis of the endgame in Go. This idea has been further developed by Elwyn R. Berlekamp and David Wolfe in their book &quot;Mathematical Go&quot;. Go endgames have been proven to be PSPACE-hard if the absolute best move must be calculated on an arbitrary mostly filled board. Certain complicated situations such as Triple Ko, Quadruple Ko, Molasses Ko, and Moonshine Life make this problem difficult. (In practice, strong Monte Carlo algorithms can still handle normal Go endgame situations well enough, and the most complicated classes of life-and-death endgame problems are unlikely to come up in a high-level game.)

Various difficult combinatorial problems (any NP-hard problem) can be converted to Go-like problems on a sufficiently large board; however, the same is true for other abstract board games, including chess and minesweeper, when suitably generalized to a board of arbitrary size. NP-complete problems do not tend in their general case to be easier for unaided humans than for suitably programmed computers: unaided humans are much worse than computers at solving, for example, instances of the subset sum problem.

== Competitions among computer Go programs ==
Several annual competitions take place between Go computer programs, including Go events at the Computer Olympiad. Regular, less formal, competitions between programs used to occur on the KGS Go Server (monthly) and the Computer Go Server (continuous).

Many programs are available that allow computer Go engines to play against each other; they almost always communicate via the Go Text Protocol (GTP).

=== History ===
The first computer Go competition was sponsored by Acornsoft, and the first regular ones by USENIX. They ran from 1984 to 1988. These competitions introduced Nemesis, the first competitive Go program from Bruce Wilcox, and G2.5 by David Fotland, which would later evolve into Cosmos and The Many Faces of Go.

One of the early drivers of computer Go research was the Ing Prize, a relatively large money award sponsored by Taiwanese banker Ing Chang-ki, offered annually between 1985 and 2000 at the World Computer Go Congress (or Ing Cup). The winner of this tournament was allowed to challenge young players at a handicap in a short match. If the computer won the match, the prize was awarded and a new prize announced: a larger prize for beating the players at a lesser handicap. The series of Ing prizes was set to expire either 1) in the year 2000 or 2) when a program could beat a 1-dan professional at no handicap for 40,000,000 NT dollars. The last winner was Handtalk in 1997, claiming 250,000 NT dollars for winning an 11-stone handicap match against three 11–13 year old amateur 2–6 dans. At the time the prize expired in 2000, the unclaimed prize was 400,000 NT dollars for winning a nine-stone handicap match.

Many other large regional Go tournaments (&quot;congresses&quot;) had an attached computer Go event. The European Go Congress has sponsored a computer tournament since 1987, and the USENIX event evolved into the US/North American Computer Go Championship, held annually from 1988 to 2000 at the US Go Congress.

Japan started sponsoring computer Go competitions in 1995. The FOST Cup was held annually from 1995 to 1999 in Tokyo. That tournament was supplanted by the Gifu Challenge, which was held annually from 2003 to 2006 in Ogaki, Gifu. The Computer Go UEC Cup has been held annually since 2007.

=== Scoring formalization in computer-computer games ===
When two computers play a game of Go against each other, the ideal is to treat the game in a manner identical to two humans playing while avoiding any intervention from actual humans. However, this can be difficult during end game scoring. The main problem is that Go playing software, which usually communicates using the standardized Go Text Protocol (GTP), will not always agree with respect to the alive or dead status of stones.

While there is no general way for two different programs to &quot;talk it out&quot; and resolve the conflict, this problem is avoided for the most part by using Chinese, Tromp-Taylor, or American Go Association (AGA) rules in which continued play (without penalty) is required until there is no more disagreement on the status of any stones on the board. In practice, such as on the KGS Go Server, the server can mediate a dispute by sending a special GTP command to the two client programs indicating they should continue placing stones until there is no question about the status of any particular group (all dead stones have been captured). The CGOS Go Server usually sees programs resign before a game has even reached the scoring phase, but nevertheless supports a modified version of Tromp-Taylor rules requiring a full play out.

These rule sets mean that a program which was in a winning position at the end of the game under Japanese rules (when both players have passed) could theoretically lose because of poor play in the resolution phase, but this is very unlikely and considered a normal part of the game under all of the area rule sets.

The main drawback to the above system is that some rule sets (such as the traditional Japanese rules) penalize the players for making these extra moves, precluding the use of additional playout for two computers. Nevertheless, most modern Go Programs support Japanese rules against humans.

Historically, another method for resolving this problem was to have an expert human judge the final board. However, this introduces subjectivity into the results and the risk that the expert would miss something the program saw.

<text>Leaf warblers are small insectivorous passerine birds belonging to the genus Phylloscopus.

Leaf warblers were formerly included in the Old World warbler family but are now considered to belong to the family Phylloscopidae, introduced in 2006. The family originally included the genus &quot;Seicercus&quot;, but all species have been moved to &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; in the most recent classification. Leaf warblers are active, constantly moving, often flicking their wings as they glean the foliage for insects along the branches of trees and bushes. They forage at various levels within forests, from the top canopy to the understorey. Most of the species are markedly territorial both in their summer and winter quarters. Most are greenish or brownish above and off-white or yellowish below. Compared to some other &quot;warblers&quot;, their songs are very simple. Species breeding in temperate regions are usually strongly migratory.

==Description==
The species are of various sizes, often green-plumaged above and yellow below, or more subdued with greyish-green to greyish-brown colours, varying little or not at all with the seasons. The tails are not very long and contain 12 feathers (unlike the similar &quot;Abroscopus&quot; species, which have 10 tail feathers). Many species are more easily identified by their distinctive songs than their dull plumage. These are very small passerines with adult body masses that can vary from and in some cases, such as the Chinese leaf warbler, are among the lightest passerines anywhere. Several of the larger species are similar in size including the large-billed leaf warbler, Radde&#x27;s warbler and the pale-legged leaf warbler. Total length can vary from .

==Distribution and habitat==
Its members occur in Eurasia, ranging into Wallacea and Africa with one species, the Arctic warbler, breeding as far east as Alaska. Many of the species breed at temperate and high latitudes in Eurasia and migrate substantial distances to winter in southeastern Asia, India, or Africa. One example is Tickell&#x27;s leaf warbler, which breeds in scrub at high elevation in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan Plateau and then moves down-slope and south to winter in the Himalayan foothills of India and Burma. Most live in forest and scrub and many are canopy or sub-canopy dwellers.

==Behavior and ecology==
The family Phylloscopidae comprises many small tree-loving warbler species that feed by gleaning insects from leaves or catching food on the wing.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826 to accommodate a single species, the willow warbler, which is therefore considered as the type species. The name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot; meaning &quot;leaf&quot; and &quot;skopos&quot; meaning &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is the only genus placed in the family Phylloscopidae that was introduced in 2006 by the Swedish ornithologist Per Alström and coworkers.

The genus contains 81 species: Of these, eleven species were formerly placed in the genus &quot;Seicercus&quot;, but a 2018 molecular phylogeny study indicated that the genus &quot;Seicercus&quot; is a synonym of &quot;Phylloscopus&quot;, leaving the family Phylloscopidae with a single genus, &quot;Phylloscopus&quot;.

<text>Wilhelm Emil &quot;Willy&quot; Messerschmitt (; 26 June 1898 – 15 September 1978) was a German aircraft designer and manufacturer. In 1934, in collaboration with Walter Rethel, he designed the Messerschmitt Bf 109, which became the most important fighter aircraft in the Luftwaffe as Germany rearmed prior to World War II. It remains the second most-produced warplane in history, with some 34,000 built, behind the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2. Another Messerschmitt aircraft, first called &quot;Bf 109R&quot;, purpose-built for record setting, but later redesignated Messerschmitt Me 209, broke the absolute world airspeed record and held the world speed record for propeller-driven aircraft until 1969. Messerschmitt&#x27;s firm also produced the first jet-powered fighter to enter service – the Messerschmitt Me 262.

==Early life==
He was born in Frankfurt am Main, the son of Baptist Ferdinand Messerschmitt (1858–1916) and his second wife, Anna Maria Schaller (1867–1942).

==First sailplane designs and World War I==
As a young man, Messerschmitt befriended German sailplane pioneer Friedrich Harth. Harth joined the German army in 1914 and while he was away at war, Messerschmitt continued work on one of Harth&#x27;s designs, the S5 glider. In 1917, Messerschmitt himself signed up for military service. Following the war, the two were reunited and continued to work together while Messerschmitt commenced study at the Munich Technical College and Harth built aircraft at the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW – Bavarian Aircraft Works). The S8 glider they designed and built together in 1921 broke a world duration record (albeit unofficially) and they went into partnership for a while running a flying school. The same year, the first plane entirely designed by Messerschmitt flew – the S9 glider.

==Beginning of his career==
In 1923 Messerschmitt graduated from the Munich Institute of Technology. The same year Harth and Messerschmitt had a falling out and went their separate ways, with Messerschmitt founding his own aircraft company at Augsburg. At first, Messerschmitt built sailplanes, but within two years had progressed via motor gliders to small powered aircraft - sports and touring types. These culminated in the Messerschmitt M 17 and Messerschmitt M 18 designs, which Messerschmitt sold to BFW in 1927, when the Bavarian state government encouraged a merger between the two companies. These were followed by the Messerschmitt M20 light transport in 1928, which proved a disaster for BFW and Messerschmitt himself. Two Deutsche Luft Hansa M20s were involved in serious crashes very soon after purchase, and this led the airline to cancel their order for the type. This caused a serious cashflow problem for the company and led to its bankruptcy in 1931. The M20 crashes also created a powerful enemy for Messerschmitt in the person of Erhard Milch, the head of Luftwaffe, who had lost a close friend in one of the crashes.

==Nazi Germany and World War II==
The ties that Messerschmitt had formed with leading Nazis Rudolf Hess and Hermann Göring (through Theo Croneiss) saved him from sharing the fate of Milch&#x27;s other great enemy, Hugo Junkers. To stay in business in the face of Milch ensuring that he would get no government contracts, Messerschmitt had signed agreements with Romania for sales of the M35 and a transport plane, the Messerschmitt M 36. When Milch learned of this, he publicly denounced Messerschmitt as a traitor, and the Gestapo was sent to question him and other BFW officials. Probably due to Croneiss&#x27; intervention, no further action was taken.

The establishment of the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (&quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot; – RLM) by the Nazi government in 1933, headed by Milch, led to a resurgence in the German aircraft industry and the resurrection of BFW. Collaborating with Robert Lusser, Messerschmitt designed the flagship product of the relaunched company. This was a low-wing four seater monoplane called the Messerschmitt M37, but better known by its later RLM designation of Bf 108. The following year, Messerschmitt incorporated many advanced design features of the Bf 108 into the Bf 109 fighter.

In 1936, the Messerschmitt Bf 109 won the RLM&#x27;s single-seat fighter contest, and became one of the main Luftwaffe aircraft types. Messerschmitt and his factory thus took an important role in the RLM&#x27;s armament plans. This role expanded even further when the Messerschmitt Bf 110 also won the multi-purpose fighter contest.

On 11 July 1938, Messerschmitt was appointed chairman and managing director of BFW and the company was renamed after him to Messerschmitt AG. This same year, the company began work on what would eventually become the Me 262, and on the Messerschmitt Me 210, planned as successor for the Bf 110. The Me 210 turned out to be plagued by massive development problems that were solved only by evolving the type into the Messerschmitt Me 410. The resulting problems and delays again put the reputation of both Messerschmitt and his namesake company in jeopardy.

==Trial and postwar career==
Following World War II, Messerschmitt was tried by a denazification court for using slave labor, and in 1948 was convicted of collaborating with the Nazi regime. After two years in prison, he was released and resumed his position as head of his company. Since Germany was forbidden to manufacture aircraft until 1955, he turned his company to manufacturing prefabricated buildings, sewing machines, and small cars – most notably the Messerschmitt Kabinenroller. Exporting his talents to Francoist Spain, he designed the Hispano HA-200 jet trainer for Hispano Aviación in Spain in 1952 before eventually being allowed to return to aircraft manufacturing in Germany to licence-produce the Fiat G91 and then Lockheed F-104 Starfighter for the West German Luftwaffe. He designed the later Helwan HA-300, a light supersonic interceptor, for the Egyptian air forces. This was his last aircraft design.

Messerschmitt saw his company through mergers first with Bölkow in 1968 and then Hamburger Flugzeugbau in 1969, at which point it became MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm, that became part of EADS now named Airbus) with Messerschmitt as chairman until 1970 when he retired. He died eight years later, on 15 September 1978 in a Munich hospital in undisclosed circumstances.

==Criticism==
Messerschmitt&#x27;s designs were characterized by a clear focus on performance, especially by striving for lightweight construction, but also by minimizing parasitic drag from aerodynamic surfaces. His critics accused him of taking this approach too far in some designs. His falling out with Harth had been over designs Harth felt to be dangerously unstable, and the Me 210 displayed instability, too, which could be cured only by enlarging the airframe and the aerodynamic surfaces, increasing drag and weight. Messerschmitt&#x27;s design philosophy also is evident in his arguments with Alexander Lippisch, who was designing the tailless Me 163 rocket fighter for production at the Messerschmitt works. While Lippisch maintained that the tailless design had an advantage, in principle, with regard to total drag, Messerschmitt pointed out that the design compromises, which are necessary to make a tailless aircraft safely controllable, defeated this purpose by increasing drag to the original level and above.

==Awards==
Messerschmitt was appointed Honorary Professor by the Munich Technical College in 1930, and the Vice-President of the &quot;Deutsche Akademie für Luftfahrtforschung&quot; (German Academy of Aeronautical Research). The German government also awarded him the title of &quot;Wehrwirtschaftsführer&quot; (defense industry leader). In 1938, Adolf Hitler bestowed upon Messerschmitt the German National Prize for Art and Science.

In 1979, Messerschmitt was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

<doc id="227039" wikidata="Q435718" url="?curid=227039" title="Pedro Nunes">
<text>Pedro Nunes (; Latin: &quot;Petrus Nonius&quot;; 1502 – 11 August 1578) was a Portuguese mathematician, cosmographer, and professor, probably from a New Christian (of Jewish origin) family.

Considered one of the greatest mathematicians of his time, Nunes is best known for being the first to approach navigation and cartography with mathematical tools. Among other accomplishments, he was the first to propose the idea of a loxodrome (a rhumb line), and was the inventor of several measuring devices, including the nonius (from which the Vernier scale was derived), named after his Latin surname.

== Life ==
Little is known about Nunes&#x27; early education, life or family background, only that he was born in Alcácer do Sal in Portugal, his origins are possibly Jewish and that his grandchildren spent a few years behind bars after they were accused by the Portuguese Inquisition of professing and secretly practicing Judaism. He studied at the University of Salamanca, maybe from 1517 until 1522. He returned to Lisbon c. 1529 and started teaching at the University. 

He continued his medical studies but held various teaching posts within the University of Lisbon, including Moral, Philosophy, Logic and Metaphysics. He obtained his doctorate in medicine in 1532. When, in 1537, the Portuguese University located in Lisbon returned to Coimbra, he moved to the re-founded University of Coimbra to teach mathematics, a post he held until 1562. This was a new post in the University of Coimbra and it may have been established to provide instruction in the technical requirements for navigation: clearly a topic of great importance in Portugal at this period, when the control of sea trade was the primary source of Portuguese wealth. Mathematics became an independent post in 1544.

In addition to teaching he was appointed Royal Cosmographer in 1529 and Chief Royal Cosmographer in 1547: a post which he held until his death.

In 1531, King John III of Portugal charged Nunes with the education of his younger brothers Luís and Henry. Years later Nunes was also charged with the education of the king&#x27;s grandson, and future king, Sebastian.

It is possible that, while at the University of Coimbra, future astronomer Christopher Clavius attended Pedro Nunes&#x27; classes, and was influenced by his works. Clavius, proponent of the Gregorian Calendar, the greatest figure of the Colégio Romano, the great center of Roman Catholic knowledge of that period, classified Nunes as “supreme mathematical genius&quot;. Nunes died in Coimbra.

== Work ==
Pedro Nunes lived in a transition period, during which science was changing from valuing theoretical knowledge (which defined the main role of a scientist/mathematician as commenting on previous authors), to providing experimental data, both as a source of information and as a method of confirming theories. Nunes was, above all, one of the last great commentators, as is shown by his first published work “Tratado da Esfera”, enriched with comments and additions that denote a profound knowledge of the difficult cosmography of the period. He also acknowledged the value of experimentation.

In his &quot;Tratado da sphera&quot; he argued for a common and universal diffusion of knowledge. Accordingly, he not only published works in Latin, at that time science&#x27;s lingua franca, aiming for an audience of European scholars, but also in Portuguese, and Spanish (&quot;Livro de Algebra&quot;).

===Navigation===

Much of Nunes&#x27; work related to navigation. He was the first to understand why a ship maintaining a steady course would not travel along a great circle, the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a spiral course, called a loxodrome. These lines —also called rhumb lines— maintain a fixed angle with the meridians. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes connection —also called navigator connection.

In his &quot;Treaty defending the sea chart&quot;, Nunes argued that a nautical chart should have its parallels and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused: a situation that lasted until Mercator developed the projection bearing his name. The Mercator Projection is the system which is still used.

===Geometry===
Nunes also solved the problem of finding the day with the shortest twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration. This problem &quot;per se&quot; is not greatly important, yet it shows the geometric genius of Nunes as it was a problem which was independently tackled by Johann and Jakob Bernoulli more than a century later with less success. They could find a solution to the problem of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they got lost in the details of differential calculus which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.

===Cosmology===
He was probably the last major mathematician to make relevant improvements to the ptolemaic system (a geocentric model describing the relative motion of the Earth and Sun). With time, in a slow and complex process, the geocentric model was replaced by the heliocentric system proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus. Nunes knew Copernicus&#x27; work but referred only briefly to it in his published works, with the purpose of correcting some mathematical errors.

Most of Nunes&#x27; achievements were possible because of his profound understanding of spherical trigonometry and his ability to transpose Ptolemy&#x27;s adaptations of Euclidean geometry to it.

===Inventions===

Nunes worked on several practical nautical problems concerning course correction as well as attempting to develop more accurate devices to determine a ship&#x27;s position.

He created the nonius to improve instrument (such as the quadrant (instrument)) accuracy. This consisted of a number of concentric circles traced on the instrument and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle. Thus the outermost quadrant would comprise 90° in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on. When an angle was measured, the circle and the division on which the alidade fell was noted. A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure.

The nonius was used by Tycho Brahe, who considered it too complex. The method inspired improved systems by Christopher Clavius and Jacob Curtius. These were eventually improved further by Pierre Vernier in 1631, which reduced the nonius to the Vernier scale that includes two scales, one of them fixed and the other movable. Vernier himself used to say that his invention was a perfected nonius and for a long time it was known as the “nonius”, even in France. In some languages, the Vernier scale is still named after Nunes, for example &quot;&quot; in Swedish.

Pedro Nunes also worked on some mechanics problems, from a mathematical point of view.

==Influence==
Nunes was very influential internationally, e.g. on the work of John Dee and Edward Wright.

==Honours==
*One of the best known Lisbon public Secondary/High Schools is named after Pedro Nunes, &quot;Escola Secundária de Pedro Nunes&quot; (teaching 7th to 12th grade). It was founded, in 1906, as &quot;Lyceu Central da 3ª Zona Escolar de Lisboa&quot; (&quot;Central Liceum of the 3rd School Area of Lisbon&quot;). Over the years had known several designations: Lyceu Central de Pedro Nunes (1911–1930), Liceu Normal de Lisboa (1930–1937), Liceu Pedro Nunes (1937–1956), Liceu Normal de Pedro Nunes (1956–1978) and Escola Secundária de Pedro Nunes (1978–), but is still known as Liceu Pedro Nunes. Multiple Portuguese personalities have studied in Pedro Nunes. The current headquarters commemorated its centenary in 2011, after being refurbished and modernized between 2008 and 2010.
*He was featured on 100 escudos coins.
*The Instituto Pedro Nunes in Coimbra, a business incubator and a center of innovation and technology transfer founded by the University of Coimbra, is named after Pedro Nunes.

<doc id="227042" wikidata="Q2830456" url="?curid=227042" title="Alamo Bowl">
<text>The Alamo Bowl is an NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision college football bowl game played annually since 1993 in the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. Since 2010 it matches the second choice team from the Pac-12 Conference and the second choice team from the Big 12 Conference. For the 2024 and 2025 seasons, the Pac-12 or Pac-12 &quot;legacy schools&quot; (former Pac-12 schools who are departing in 2024) will continue to fulfill their prior conference tie-in role. Traditionally, the Alamo Bowl has been played in December, although it was played in January following the 2009, 2014, and 2015 seasons. This year&#x27;s game was played on December 28, 2024. 

Since 2007, the game has been sponsored by Valero Energy Corporation and officially known as the &quot;Valero Alamo Bowl&quot;. Previous sponsors include MasterCard (2002–2005), Sylvania (1999–2001), and Builders Square (1993–1998).

==History==
The game was previously known as the Builders Square Alamo Bowl (1993–1998), the Sylvania Alamo Bowl (1999–2001), and the MasterCard Alamo Bowl (2002–2005). The logo of the event has evolved to reflect the changes in sponsorship. On May 24, 2007, the Alamo Bowl announced a partnership with San Antonio-based Valero Energy Corporation, and thus the bowl&#x27;s full name was changed. The partnership with Valero is in place until 2025.

The game originally gave an automatic invite to a team from the now-defunct Southwest Conference (SWC). However, in 1993, only two of the eight SWC teams finished with the necessary 6 wins against Division I-A teams to become bowl-eligible, and those two teams were already committed to other bowls, so the Iowa Hawkeyes were invited instead. The SWC was able to provide teams for the next two seasons (Baylor Bears in 1994 and Texas A&amp;M Aggies in 1995) before the conference disbanded.

During the 1996 Alamo Bowl, the Iowa Hawkeyes wore plain black helmets (removing their tigerhawk logo and gold stripe) in honor of linebacker Mark Mitchell&#x27;s mother, who died in a car accident while traveling to San Antonio for the game.

The 2002 Alamo Bowl played between the Colorado Buffaloes and Wisconsin Badgers was the first Alamo Bowl to go into overtime, with the unranked Badgers defeating the No. 14 ranked Buffaloes after kicking a field goal to win 31–28, completing a perfect non-conference schedule at 6-0 (the Badgers finished with a 2-6 record in the Big Ten). The 2008 Alamo Bowl between the Missouri Tigers and Northwestern Wildcats also went into overtime, with the Tigers defeating the Wildcats 30–23.

The 2005 Alamo Bowl ended with one of the most controversial plays in bowl game history. During the multi-lateral play, almost the entire Nebraska Cornhuskers team and coaching staff as well as half of the Michigan Wolverines sideline came onto the field, and the Cornhuskers gave their coach a Gatorade shower before the play was blown dead. It drew parallels to 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Play&quot;, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Music City Miracle&quot;, and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Bluegrass Miracle&quot;. Nebraska would win the game 32−28 after Michigan was not able to reach the endzone.

The 2007 Alamo Bowl between the Penn State Nittany Lions and the Texas A&amp;M Aggies was attended by 66,166, an Alamodome facility-record crowd for a sporting event, breaking the previous record set by the Iowa Hawkeyes and Texas Longhorns in the 2006 Alamo Bowl. The Nittany Lions won the game 24–17.

The Alamo Bowl has sold out seven of its 16 games (1995, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2011).

On August 28, 2009, the Alamo Bowl organizers announced they had reached an agreement with the then Pac-10 Conference to replace the Big Ten Conference in the Alamo Bowl. Under the terms of the agreement, the now Pac-12 Conference&#x27;s (Pac-12) second-choice team earns a bid to the Alamo Bowl. The agreement took effect beginning with the 2010 college football season. The Pac-12&#x27;s second-choice team was previously contracted to play in the Holiday Bowl against the third choice from the Big 12. The Big 12&#x27;s third choice also moved to the Alamo Bowl, and the Holiday Bowl now gets third choice of team from the Pac-12 and the fourth choice from the Big Ten.

In the 2011 Alamo Bowl, the Baylor Bears and Washington Huskies combined to score 123 points, breaking the record for the most points scored in a bowl game in college football history. Baylor won the game, 67–56. The 2011 game was also the first Alamo Bowl to feature a season&#x27;s Heisman Trophy winner, Baylor&#x27;s Robert Griffin III.

<doc id="227049" wikidata="Q260295" url="?curid=227049" title="Single-phase electric power">
<text>In electrical engineering, single-phase electric power (abbreviated 1φ) is the distribution of alternating current electric power using a system in which all the voltages of the supply vary in unison. Single-phase distribution is used when loads are mostly lighting and heating, with few large electric motors. A single-phase supply connected to an alternating current electric motor does not produce a rotating magnetic field; single-phase motors need additional circuits for starting (capacitor start motor), and such motors are uncommon above 10 kW in rating.

Because the voltage of a single phase system reaches a peak value twice in each cycle, the instantaneous power is not constant.

Standard frequencies of single-phase power systems are either 50 or 60 Hz. Special single-phase traction power networks may operate at 16.67 Hz or other frequencies to power electric railways.

==History==
Single phase power transmission took many years to develop. The earliest developments were based on the early alternator inventions of 19th century Parisian scientist Hippolyte Pixii, which were later expanded upon by Lord Kelvin and others in the 1880s. The first full AC power system, based on single phase alternating current, was created by William Stanley with financial support from Westinghouse in 1886. In 1897, experiments began for single phase power transmission.

==Applications== 
In North America, individual residences and small commercial buildings with services up to about 100 kVA (417 amperes at 240 volts) will usually have three-wire single-phase distribution, especially in rural areas where motor loads are small and uncommon. In rural areas where no three-phase supply is available, farmers or households who wish to use three-phase motors may install a phase converter. Larger consumers such as large buildings, shopping centers, factories, office blocks, and multiple-unit apartment blocks have three-phase service. In densely populated areas of cities, network power distribution is used with many customers and many supply transformers connected to provide hundreds or thousands of kilo-volt-amperes, a load concentrated over a few hundred square meters.

High-power systems, hundreds of kilovolt-amperes or larger, are nearly always three-phase. The largest supply normally available as single-phase varies according to the standards of the electrical utility. In the United Kingdom a single-phase household supply may be rated 100 A or even 125 A, meaning that there is little need for three-phase in a domestic or small commercial environment. Much of the rest of Europe has traditionally had much smaller limits on the size of single phase supplies resulting in even houses being supplied with three-phase (in urban areas with three-phase supply networks).

If heating equipment designed for a 240-volt system is connected to two phases of a 208-volt supply, it will produce only 75% of its rated heating effect. Single-phase motors may have taps to allow their use on either 208-volt or 240-volt supply.

A single-phase load may be powered directly from a three-phase distribution transformer in two ways: by connection between one phase and neutral or by connection between two phases. These two give different voltages from a given supply. For example, on a 120/208 three-phase system, which is common in North America, the phase-to-neutral voltage is 120 volts and the phase-to-phase voltage is 208 volts. This allows single-phase lighting to be connected phase-to-neutral.

Single-phase power may be used for electric railways; the largest single-phase generator in the world, at Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant, supplied a railway system on a dedicated traction power network.

==Grounding==
Typically a third conductor, called &quot;ground&quot; (or &quot;safety ground&quot;) (U.S.) or &quot;protective earth&quot; (UK, Europe, IEC), is used as a protection against electric shock, and ordinarily carries significant current only when there is a circuit fault. Several different earthing systems are in use. In some extreme rural areas single-wire earth return distribution is used.

==Splitting out==

Single-phase is sometimes divided in half at the distribution transformer on the secondary winding to create split-phase electric power for household appliances and lighting.

<text>The typical warblers are small birds belonging to the genus Sylvia in the &quot;Old World warbler&quot; (or sylviid warbler) family Sylviidae.

There are seven species in the genus. Typical warblers occur in the temperate to tropical regions of Europe, western and central Asia, and Africa, with the highest species diversity centred on the Mediterranean.

They are strongly built, with stouter legs and a slightly thicker bill than many other warblers. The plumage is in varying shades of grey and brown, usually darker above and paler below, with bluish or pinkish tones in several species; several also have orange-brown or rufous fringed wing feathers. The tail is square-ended in most, slightly rounded in a few, and in several species has white sides. Many of the species show some sexual dimorphism, with distinctive male and female plumages, with the males in many having black or bright grey on the heads, replaced by brown, brownish-grey or similar dusky colours in females; about a third of the species also have a conspicuous red eye ring in males. Species breeding in cool temperate regions are strongly migratory, while most of those in warmer regions are partially migratory or resident. They are active warblers usually associated with open woodland, scrub, hedges or shrubs. Their diet is largely insectivorous, though several species also eat fruit extensively, mainly small berries such as elder and ivy, particularly from late summer to late winter; one species (blackcap) also frequently takes a wide variety of human-provided foods on birdtables in winter.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Sylvia&quot; was introduced in 1769 by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. Scopoli did not specify a type species but this was designated as the Eurasian blackcap (&quot;Sylvia atricapilla&quot;) by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1828. The genus name is from Modern Latin &quot;silvia&quot;, a woodland sprite, related to &quot;silva&quot; meaning &quot;a wood&quot;.

The typical warblers are now known to form a major lineage in a clade containing also the parrotbills and some taxa formerly considered to be Old World babblers. The other &quot;Old World warblers&quot; have been moved to their own families, entirely redelimiting the Sylviidae.

A molecular phylogenetic study using mitochondrial DNA sequence data published in 2011 found that the species in the genus &quot;Sylvia&quot; formed two distinct clades. Based on these results, the ornithologists Edward Dickinson and Leslie Christidis in the fourth edition of &quot;Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World&quot;, chose to split the genus and moved most of the species into a resurrected genus &quot;Curruca&quot; retaining only the Eurasian blackcap and the garden warbler in &quot;Sylvia&quot;. In an additional change they moved the African hill babbler from &quot;Horizorhinus&quot; and Dohrn&#x27;s warbler from &quot;Pseudoalcippe&quot; into &quot;Sylvia&quot;. The split was at first not made by the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union on the grounds that &quot;a split into two genera would unnecessarily destabilize nomenclature and results in only a minor increase in phylogenetic information content&quot;, but then later accepted in 2021.

===Extant species===
The genus as currently circumscribed includes the following species:
* Eurasian blackcap &quot;Sylvia atricapilla&quot;
* Garden warbler &quot;Sylvia borin&quot;
* Dohrn&#x27;s warbler &quot;Sylvia dohrni&quot;
* Abyssinian catbird &quot;Sylvia galinieri&quot;
* Bush blackcap &quot;Sylvia nigricapillus&quot;
* African hill babbler &quot;Sylvia abyssinica&quot;

<text>A superorganism, or supraorganism, is a group of synergetically-interacting organisms of the same species. A community of synergetically-interacting organisms of different species is called a &quot;holobiont&quot;.

==Concept==
The term superorganism is used most often to describe a social unit of eusocial animals in which division of labour is highly specialised and individuals cannot survive by themselves for extended periods. Ants are the best-known example of such a superorganism. A superorganism can be defined as &quot;a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective&quot;, phenomena being any activity &quot;the hive wants&quot; such as ants collecting food and avoiding predators, or bees choosing a new nest site. In challenging environments, micro organisms collaborate and evolve together to process unlikely sources of nutrients such as methane. This process called syntrophy (&quot;eating together&quot;) might be linked to the evolution of eukaryote cells and involved in the emergence or maintenance of life forms in challenging environments on Earth and possibly other planets. Superorganisms tend to exhibit homeostasis, power law scaling, persistent disequilibrium and emergent behaviours.

The term was coined in 1789 by James Hutton, the &quot;father of geology&quot;, to refer to Earth in the context of geophysiology. The Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock, and Lynn Margulis as well as the work of Hutton, Vladimir Vernadsky and Guy Murchie, have suggested that the biosphere itself can be considered a superorganism, but that has been disputed. This view relates to systems theory and the dynamics of a complex system.

The concept of a superorganism raises the question of what is to be considered an individual. Toby Tyrrell&#x27;s critique of the Gaia hypothesis argues that Earth&#x27;s climate system does not resemble an animal&#x27;s physiological system. Planetary biospheres are not tightly regulated in the same way that animal bodies are: &quot;planets, unlike animals, are not products of evolution. Therefore we are entitled to be highly skeptical (or even outright dismissive) about whether to expect something akin to a &#x27;superorganism&#x27;&quot;. He concludes that &quot;the superorganism analogy is unwarranted&quot;.

Some scientists have suggested that individual human beings can be thought of as &quot;superorganisms&quot;; as a typical human digestive system contains 1013 to 1014 microorganisms whose collective genome, the microbiome studied by the Human Microbiome Project, contains at least 100 times as many genes as the human genome itself. Salvucci wrote that superorganism is another level of integration that is observed in nature. These levels include the genomic, the organismal and the ecological levels. The genomic structure of organisms reveals the fundamental role of integration and gene shuffling along evolution.

== In social theory ==
The 19th-century thinker Herbert Spencer coined the term &quot;super-organic&quot; to focus on social organization (the first chapter of his &quot;Principles of Sociology&quot; is entitled &quot;Super-organic Evolution&quot;), though this was apparently a distinction between the organic and the social, &quot;not&quot; an identity: Spencer explored the holistic nature of society as a social organism while distinguishing the ways in which society did not behave like an organism. For Spencer, the super-organic was an emergent property of interacting organisms, that is, human beings. And, as has been argued by D. C. Phillips, there is a &quot;difference between emergence and reductionism&quot;.

The economist Carl Menger expanded upon the evolutionary nature of much social growth but never abandoned methodological individualism. Many social institutions arose, Menger argued, not as &quot;the result of socially teleological causes, but the unintended result of innumerable efforts of economic subjects pursuing &#x27;individual&#x27; interests&quot;.

Both Spencer and Menger argued that because individuals choose and act, any social whole should be considered less than an organism, but Menger emphasized that more strongly. Spencer used the idea to engage in extended analysis of social structure and conceded that it was primarily an analogy. For Spencer, the idea of the super-organic best designated a distinct level of social reality above that of biology and psychology, not a one-to-one identity with an organism. Nevertheless, Spencer maintained that &quot;every organism of appreciable size is a society&quot;, which has suggested to some that the issue may be terminological.

The term &quot;superorganic&quot; was adopted by the anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber in 1917. Social aspects of the superorganism concept are analysed by Alan Marshall in his 2002 book &quot;The Unity of Nature&quot;. Finally, recent work in social psychology has offered the superorganism metaphor as a unifying framework to understand diverse aspects of human sociality, such as religion, conformity, and social identity processes.

==In cybernetics==
Superorganisms are important in cybernetics, particularly biocybernetics, since they are capable of the so-called &quot;distributed intelligence&quot;, a system composed of individual agents that have limited intelligence and information. They can pool resources and so can complete goals that are beyond reach of the individuals on their own. Existence of such behavior in organisms has many implications for military and management applications and is being actively researched.

Superorganisms are also considered dependent upon cybernetic governance and processes. This is based on the idea that a biological system – in order to be effective – needs a sub-system of cybernetic communications and control. This is demonstrated in the way a mole rat colony uses functional synergy and cybernetic processes together.

Joël de Rosnay also introduced a concept called &quot;cybionte&quot; to describe cybernetic superorganism. The notion associates superorganism with chaos theory, multimedia technology, and other new developments.

<text>A slide projector is an optical device for projecting enlarged images of photographic slides onto a screen. Many projectors have mechanical arrangements to show a series of slides loaded into a special tray sequentially.

35 mm slide projectors, direct descendants of the larger-format magic lantern, first came into widespread use during the 1950s for slide shows as home entertainment, and for use by educational and other institutes. Reversal film created a small positive projectable image rather than the negatives used since the early days of photography; photography now produced 35mm directly viewable small colour slides, rather than large monochrome negatives. The slide images were too small for unaided viewing, and required enlargement by a projector or enlarging viewer.

Photographic film slides and projectors have been replaced by image files on digital storage media shown on a projection screen by using a video projector, or displayed on a large-screen video monitor.

== History ==

A continuous-slide lantern was patented in 1881. It included a dissolving views apparatus.

==Design==

A projector has three main optical elements:
* high luminous flux electric incandescent light bulb or other light source, usually fan-cooled
* reflector and condenser lens system to direct the light through the slide
* focusing projection lens

Most slide projectors have a mechanism to hold slides in place during projection; many feature automated or mechanized slide advance and return to facilitate slideshows with multiple images.

===Light source and collimation===

An incandescent lamp bulb is used to generate light, usually specially designed to have a small, bright filament to produce a sharp and bright image. For example, the Leitz Pradovit RC uses a special 24V 150W quartz lamp, with provision to center it, required for best performance. This projector had provision to reduce lamp power by 20% to double its life (50 hours at full brightness).

Light from the bulb is modified from a point source by reflection and passing through condenser lens(es) to generate a collimated beam, which is then directed through the slide. A flat piece of heat-absorbing glass is usually placed in the light path before the slide, to avoid damaging the latter. This glass transmits visible wavelengths but absorbs infrared. Some slide projectors used bulbs that had an integral multifaceted reflector, which were more expensive than bare bulbs, but were more convenient to use, as the reflector did not have to be adjusted after bulb changes.

===Projection===

After the collimated beam passes through the transparent slide, it is enlarged by a projection lens onto a flat projection screen so the audience can view the reflected image. For some slide projectors, the projection lens is removable and may be swapped with alternative lens(es) to change the brightness or focal length(s), which may affect potential size of the image or the distance from the screen required for a certain projected image size, respectively.

Standard focal lengths for projector lenses are approximately twice that of a normal lens for that film format, which allows the projector to be located behind the audience for an average screen size. For example, with 135 film, a standard projector lens focal length would be around 100 mm. Starting in the 1970s, some slide projectors were offered with autofocus to compensate for differences in slide mount thickness or warping.

Alternatively, the image may be projected onto a translucent &quot;rear projection&quot; screen, often used for continuous automatic display for close viewing. For example, the Singer &quot;Caramate&quot; and Bell &amp; Howell &quot;RingMaster&quot; projected slides onto a flat screen approximately the size and shape of a small CRT TV; the RingMaster also could be used for front projection for larger audiences. This form of projection also avoids the potential of the audience interrupting the projected light beam by casting their shadows on the projection or by bumping into the projector.

===Mechanical===

Some slide projectors required users to manually place each slide that was being shown. Starting in the 1950s, manufacturers introduced slide projectors with mechanisms which handle slides preloaded into cartridges, moving individual slides into and out of the light path in sequence. One of the primary differentiators between slide projectors was the form factor of the cartridges used to hold and, in many cases, store slides. Some automated slide projectors offered slide trays with straight, rectangular shapes, which were popular in Europe; these use an arm, moving laterally, to extract a slide from the cartridge for projection. Some straight-tray machines could also accept vertical rotary cartridges, which resemble a Ferris wheel. In the United States, Eastman Kodak introduced Carousel slide projectors in 1961, which used a horizontal rotary cartridge like the namesake merry-go-round, and the format soon became ubiquitous there. Advantages of Carousel-type slide projectors include a simpler, gravity-fed mechanism, and the ability to automatically repeat the sequence of images without having to reload; however, the circular trays tended to be bulkier and more expensive.

Sophisticated transition effects between images, such as dissolves, can be performed with multiple projectors; Rollei introduced the P3800 at photokina 1976, which had two lenses and could perform without an additional unit. By 1990, Rollei marketed the Rolleivision 35 Twin Digital, an upgraded P3800 which added a personal computer interface to control its operation. However, competing technologies which used images directly displayed from computers, such as projection panels and video projectors, largely displaced film slide projectors by the mid-1990s.

==Types==

Slide projectors proper:
* Straight-tray slide projectors have a straight magazine holding several slides.
* Carousel slide projectors have a circular magazine holding several slides.
* Stack-loader slide projectors
* Bell &amp; Howell Slide Cube Projector had a cube-shaped magazine holding several slides.
* Dual slide projectors
* Single slide projectors project a single slide at a time, changed by the operator.
* Dissolve projectors
* Stereo slide projectors project two slides simultaneously with different polarizations, making slides appear as three-dimensional to viewers wearing polarizing glasses
* Medium-format slide projectors, for medium-format slides larger than 35mm.
* Specialised large-format slide projectors for large transparencies of 18 × 18 cm (7.1 × 7.1&quot;) or larger.

Related devices:
* Overhead projectors, for page-sized transparencies
* Slide viewer, for direct viewing of a magnified image of a slide

<doc id="227057" wikidata="Q261637" url="?curid=227057" title="Hachiman">
<text>In Japanese religion, Yahata (八幡神, ancient Shinto pronunciation) formerly in Shinto and later commonly known as Hachiman (八幡神, Japanese Buddhist pronunciation) is the syncretic divinity of archery and war, incorporating elements from both Shinto and Buddhism.

The first mention of this kami is found in the Shoku Nihongi as it contains the information that offerings were sent 794 CE to Hachiman shrines on the occasion of conflict with the kingdom Silla in Korea. 

In Shinto religion, he is mortally Emperor Ōjin (応神天皇, &quot;Ōjin Tennō&quot;) by birth who reigned in the 3rd–4th century and the son of Empress Jingū (神功皇后, &quot;Jingū-kōgō&quot;), later became deified and identified by legend as &quot;Yahata-no-kami&quot; meaning &quot;Kami of Eight Banners&quot;, referring to the eight heavenly banners that signaled the birth of the divine and deified emperor, and is also called Hondawake (誉田別命). His messenger is the dove, symbolizes both the bow and arrow found in samurai banners associated to him where he is called &quot;&quot;&quot;.

Since ancient times Hachiman has been worshiped by farmers as the god of agriculture and by fishermen, who hoped that he would fill their nets with many fish.

During the age of the samurai, descendants of both samurai clans, Seiwa Genji (清和源氏 &quot;Seiwa Gen-ji&quot;, a line of the Minamoto clan descended from Emperor Seiwa) and Kanmu Taira (桓武平氏 &quot;Kanmu Taira&#x27;u-ji/ Hei-shi/ Hei-ji&quot;, a line of the Taira clan descended from Emperor Kanmu) honored Hachiman, from which the tradition is derived nationwide in which samurai clans (武家 &quot;buke&quot;&quot; in Japanese) honor Hachiman as the deity sacred to them. His other roles include determining a samurai&#x27;s fate—i.e., whether they are a success or failure in battle; controlling and protecting the martial arts; and proclaiming the victory of an army.

Although often called the god of war, he is more strictly defined as the tutelary god of warriors. He is also the divine protector of Japan, the Japanese people and the Imperial House.

== Summary of Hachiman ==

In the present form of Shinto, Hachiman is the divine spirit of Emperor Ōjin. Emperor Kinmei (欽明天皇, &quot;Kinmei-tennō&quot;) in his Regnal Year 32 (571 AD) decreed that the deified Emperor Ōjin was revealed for the first time in the land of Usa (宇佐の地)—the present-day city of Usa, in Oita Prefecture—where he became the patron deity of this city, along with a lesser Shinto female deity called &quot;Himegami&quot; (比売神) and the Emperor&#x27;s mother, Empress Jingū. This trio, known as Hachiman Mikami (八幡三神) is enshrined there. 

Amongst the &quot;Hachiman Mikami&quot;, there are many shrines that enshrines other figures apart from the trio, like Emperor Chūai (仲哀天皇, &quot;Chūai-tennō&quot;) instead of Empress Jingū, the legendary hero and Shinto deity &quot;Takenouchi no Sukune&quot; or &quot;Takeshiuchi no Sukune&quot; (武内宿禰) and the female deity &quot;Tamayori-hime&quot; (玉依毘売命 or 玉依姫尊), where there is a dedicated prayer for safe childbirth in the Shinto shrine of Umi Hachimangū (宇美八幡宮) in Umi, Fukuoka prefecture.

The three &quot;Munakata&quot; goddesses (宗像三女神 &quot;Munakata Sanjoshin&quot;) born from the divination ritual &quot;Ukehi&quot; or &quot;Ukei&quot; (宇気比, 誓約, 祈, 誓, 誓占, lit. &quot;pledge divination&quot;) between the goddess Amaterasu and the god Susanoo - that is &quot;Tagitsu-hime&quot; (多岐津姫命), &quot;Ichikishima-hime&quot; (市杵嶋姫命) and &quot;Tagairi-hime&quot; (多紀理姫命) - is said where they descended from the heavens as the &quot;Three Pillars of &quot;Usanoshima&quot; (宇佐嶋) of the ancient province of Tsukushi (筑紫)&quot;, located in a temple complex on Mt. Omotosan (御許山) in Usa. 

The &quot;Munakata&quot; goddesses are thereby the matriarchs of an ancient tribe and clan &quot;Munakata-shi&quot; (宗像氏, 宗形氏) which fishermen worshipped collectively as a whole. It is thought that the worship of &quot;Munakata&quot; goddesses by the &quot;Munakata&quot; clan was due to Empress Jingū&#x27;s success in the &quot;Conquest of the Three Kingdoms (of Korea)&quot; (三韓征伐 &quot;Sankan Seipatsu&quot;). Therefore, they are old Shinto folk deities (地主神 &quot;jinushigami&quot;) before the presence of Hachiman. 

&quot;Himegami&quot; (比売神) is thought to be the consort or aunt of Hachiman, whereas &quot;Tamayori-hime&quot; (玉依毘売命 or 玉依姫尊) possibly and perhaps as the mother viewed by opinion aforementioned. Since the description of Hachiman as the Emperor Ōjin appeared in the &quot;Digest Record of &quot;Todai-ji Temple&quot; (東大寺要録 &quot;Tōdai-ji Yoroku&quot;)&quot; and &quot;Records of the Age of the Gods from the &quot;Sumiyoshi Grand Shrine&quot; (住吉大社神代記 &quot;Sumiyoshi-Taisha Jindaiki&quot;), the practice of merging Emperor Ōjin into Hachiman is estimated to have begun in the Nara Period or the Heian Period. 

There are also different theories and opinions concerning the goddesses Amaterasu and &quot;Kukuri-hime&quot; (菊理媛神 or 菊理媛命, a Shinto goddess venerated as &quot;Shirayama-hime&quot; (白山比咩), in which both called the goddess &quot;Himegami&quot; &quot;Himiko&quot; (卑弥呼, or &quot;Pimiko&quot;, also known as &quot;Shin-gi Wa-ō&quot; (親魏倭王, &quot;Ruler of Wa, Friend of Wei&quot;), a shamaness-queen of Yamatai-koku in Wakoku (倭国) around c. 170–248 AD.

=== Empress Jingū ===

Emperor Ojin was already destined to ascend the throne from the moment in the womb of his mother and Empress, is called &quot;Emperor in the Womb&quot;, is based and interpreted sometimes in her belief as being the &quot;mother deity&quot; to the child-to-be who would be deified. The Three &quot;Munakata&quot; Goddesses, the Three &quot;Sumiyoshi&quot; Gods (住吉三神 &quot;Sumiyoshi Sanjin&quot;) and the goddess Amaterasu who were revered by the tribal clan &quot;Munakata-shi&quot; due to their aid in the &quot;Conquest of the Three Kingdoms (of Korea)&quot; is also worshiped in various places. It is said by tradition in commemoration after the conquest, Empress Jingu set up eight big military flags on Tsushima (対馬) which then became the origin of the name &quot;&quot;Hirohatano Yahata Ōkami&quot; (広幡乃八幡大神)&quot;,&quot; also the origin of the name &quot;Yahata&quot; (八幡)&quot;&quot;&quot; to the Empress&#x27; son, the then-emperor Ojin.

== Imperial Ancestor and Deity to the Imperial Family ==
Since Hachiman was considered to be a divine spirit of the Emperor Ojin, he was placed as both the ancestor and &quot;Kōso-shin&quot; (皇祖神, &quot;Imperial Ancestor Deity&quot;) of the Imperial Family of Japan. He was considered to be the guardian deity of the Imperial Household after the Grand Goddess &quot;Amaterasu&quot; written down in the &quot;Chronicle of the &quot;Jōkyū&quot; Era&quot; (&quot;承久記 Jōkyūki&quot;) to the &quot;Compilation of the Grand Goddess &quot;Amaterasu&quot; of Ise and &quot;Hachiman Daibosatsu&quot; on the Imperial Throne of Japan&quot;. 

The founding of &quot;Konda Hachiman-gū&quot; (誉田八幡宮) Shrine at Habikino in Osaka Prefecture have been a long time linked with the connection to Emperor Ojin, therefore the Imperial Family also both revered the Usa Shrine (宇佐神宮 &quot;Usa Jingū&quot;, also known as 宇佐八幡宮 &quot;Usa Hachiman-gū&quot;) at Usa in Oita Prefecture, and the Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine (石清水八幡宮 &quot;Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū&quot;) at Yawata in Kyoto Prefecture, as the second ancestral shrine after the dominant Ise Grand Shrine (伊勢神宮 &quot;Ise Jingū&quot;).

==Syncretism of Hachiman in between Shinto and Buddhism==
After the arrival of Buddhism in Japan, Hachiman became a syncretistic deity, fusing elements of the native &quot;kami&quot; worship with Buddhism (&quot;shinbutsu-shūgō&quot;). In the 8th century AD, he joined the Buddhist pantheon as where his &quot;jinja&quot; (神社 - Shinto shrines) &quot;and jingu&quot; (神宮 - Shinto shrine of the Imperial family) were incorporated to shrines in Buddhist temples (寺 &quot;tera&quot;).

This transition happened when the Great Buddha of Tōdai-ji (東大寺, &quot;Eastern Great Temple&quot;) was being built and recorded in the era of the &quot;First Year of &quot;Tenpyō-shōhō&quot; (天平勝宝 &quot;Heavenly Peace and Victorious Treasure&quot;)&quot; under the reign of Empress Kōken in 749 AD, an oracle was declared by Hachiman to a senior Shinto priest (禰宜 &quot;negi&quot;) and nun from Usa Shrine to proceed to the capital (in Nara) that Hachiman would cooperate in the construction of a &quot;Great Buddha&quot; dedicated to him. From this recognition Hachiman was syncretised into Buddhism from early on. 

Then in the &quot;First Year of the Era of Ten&#x27;ō (天応)&quot; under the reign of Emperor Kōnin in 781 AD, the Shinto imperial court granted the Shinto deity &quot;Usa Hachiman&quot; (Hachiman of Usa) with Buddhist deity &quot;Hachiman Daibosatsu&quot; as the guardian god for the spiritual protection of the state. As a result, the spread of worship to Hachiman is transferred and received to Buddhist temples or shrines throughout the country where the &quot;theory of Shinto and Buddhist syncretism (本地垂迹 &quot;Honji Suijaku&quot;)&quot; is established, therefore considered Amitabha to be the Buddha manifestation of Hachiman. However, the Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren (日蓮) of the Kamakura Period says he denies the theory and assumes the true form of &quot;Hachiman Daibosatsu&quot; is Shakyamuni Buddha (i.e. Gautama Buddha)&quot;.&quot;

Thereafter in the Heian Period, veneration of Shinto shrines of Hachiman have been received and gathered throughout the nation by the samurai clans Seiwa of the Genji clan (清和源氏) and Kanmu of the Taira clan (桓武平氏). When the theory of syncretism has spread during this period, Hachiman is depicted to represent a Buddhist monk and is then called &quot;Sogyō Hachiman&quot; (僧形八幡神, &quot;Buddhist Priest-Form Hachiman&quot;).

==Worship of Hachiman by the Samurai==
Because Emperor Ōjin was an ancestor of the Minamoto warrior clan, Hachiman became its . Minamoto no Yoshiie, upon coming of age at Iwashimizu Shrine in Kyoto, took the name &quot;Hachiman Taro Yoshiie&quot;, and, through his military prowess and virtue as a leader, came to be regarded and respected as the ideal samurai through the ages. After Minamoto no Yoritomo became &quot;shōgun&quot; and established the Kamakura shogunate, Hachiman&#x27;s popularity grew and he became by extension the protector of the warrior class that the shōgun had brought to power. For this reason, the &quot;shintai&quot; of a Hachiman shrine is usually a stirrup or a bow.

Following the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate, the worship of Hachiman spread throughout Japan among not only samurai, but also the peasantry. There are now about 2,500 Shinto shrines dedicated to Hachiman, who has more shrines dedicated to him than any other deity except Inari. Usa Shrine in Usa, Ōita Prefecture is head shrine of all these shrines; other important Hachiman shrines are Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū, Hakozaki-gū and Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū.

Hachiman&#x27;s mon (emblem) is a &quot;mitsudomoe&quot;, a round whirlpool or vortex with three heads swirling right or left. Many samurai clans used this &quot;mon&quot; as their own, including some that traced their ancestry back to the mortal enemy of the Minamoto, the Emperor Kanmu of the Taira clan (, &quot;Kanmu Heishi&quot;).

<doc id="227062" wikidata="Q840529" url="?curid=227062" title="Sailor Mars">
<text>, better known as , is a fictional character in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga series written and illustrated by Naoko Takeuchi. In the series, Rei is her sailor form&#x27;s alternative human identity as part of the Sailor Guardians, female supernatural fighters who protect the Solar System from evil.

Rei is the second Sailor Guardian to be discovered by Usagi, following after Ami Mizuno. She possesses powers associated with fire, the Ofuda charm, and psychic clairvoyance. Aside from the main body of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series, Rei is featured in two different manga short stories. The first, &quot;Casablanca Memories&quot;, is entirely about her and her past; the second, &quot;Rei and Minako&#x27;s Girls School Battle&quot;, is shared with Minako Aino. A number of image songs mentioning her character have been released as well, including the contents of three different CD singles.

Takeuchi based Rei on her own personal experience as a miko. Originally designed with her own unique outfit, when Takeuchi decided to give all of the Guardians identical outfits, Rei&#x27;s high heels were the only aspect that was carried over. A cold and aloof character in the manga, her personality was drastically changed in the anime adaptation at the behest of Kunihiko Ikuhara, where she became stubborn.

==Profile==
Rei first appears as a miko at the , and is shown to have an affinity with two crows who live there. It is revealed in the manga that as a child, the crows &quot;told&quot; her that their names are Phobos and Deimos (the same as Mars&#x27; two moons). In the manga, she is portrayed as imperial, ancient, conservative, old-fashioned, traditional, serious, disciplined, and practical, having contempt for men and disliking modern romantic relationships.

In the anime adaptation, Rei is a disciplined and practical person. She is also greatly interested in pop culture, and she excels at music—composing songs for a school festival. Rei and Usagi Tsukino have a very tempestuous relationship, and argue frequently. Though these arguments are usually petty, early in the series Rei attempts to usurp Usagi as the leader of Sailor Guardians. Even though Rei does become more loyal to Usagi, with slightly calmer emotions in the later seasons, she still remains somewhat more of a typical teenager than her manga counterpart. In the anime, Rei also tends to engage in long periods of antagonizing Usagi (who returns the same reaction), as a running gag in their arguments.

Rei goes to a different school from the other girls, namely T*A Private Girls School, a Catholic institution run by nuns. She herself is a practitioner of Shinto, living and working at Hikawa Shrine with her grandfather, its head priest. Her mother died when Rei was very young; her father is a famous politician who cares more about his job than about her (though in the live-action version he still tries to be involved in her life), and who only visits Rei on her birthday. She carries a certain amount of dislike towards him, especially in the live-action series, in which the character of her grandfather does not appear.
Because of the lack of respectable males in her life, Rei harbors a generally low opinion of men. She considers them untrustworthy and seems genuinely uninterested in romance. The one exception is in a manga side-story centering on her, &quot;Casablanca Memories&quot;, which tells of Rei&#x27;s friendship with her father&#x27;s young secretary, Kaidou. He had been kind to her for her entire life and, in the story, she fancies herself in love with him. She is shocked when he suddenly announces his engagement to another girl and his decision to become a politician, despite having once said that he did not like what had happened to Rei&#x27;s family as a result of her father&#x27;s work. Proof of her feelings are further cemented when she moves to kiss Kaidou, asking why, if he wanted to marry into the profession, why not choose to marry her due to her father&#x27;s political influence. In the manga, this is the only potential romance in her life; in the live-action series, nothing of the sort is ever shown, as Rei unquestionably detests boys. In the anime only, she &quot;dates&quot; Mamoru Chiba in the first season (though he thinks they are just friends), and occasionally seems open to a relationship with Yūichirō Kumada, her grandfather&#x27;s pupil. In one episode, on the brink of death, she states that she wished she had kissed Yūichirō before leaving. In the original anime, she states in episode 152 that she dreams of one day getting married.

Later on, members of the Dead Moon Circus harass Rei with a reflection of her young self, which mocks her for her friendships and her dream of being a priestess. The reflection tells her that the only way for her to be happy is to try her luck with numerous men until she ends up married to someone rich. Rei is able to defeat this illusion, and in the process gains her Sailor Crystal along with the memory that, long ago, she had in fact made a vow of chastity to Princess Serenity. After this realization, she is never again shown having any doubts about her lack of interest in romance. This is never mentioned in the other series.

Rei&#x27;s lifelong dream is to become the head priestess at Hikawa Shrine, and much of her life is influenced by spirituality, particularly in the manga. Meditation is given as her strong point, and she enjoys fortune-telling as a hobby. The elegance of her character is further underscored by the contrast between her favorite subject, ancient writing, and her least favorite, modern society. She also belongs to the Archery club at school, which later provides the context for her most powerful weapon, the Mars Arrow. Rei is also skilled in martial arts and a talented skier in the anime. As for more general tastes, Rei likes the colors red and black, fugu, Thai food, white casablancas, ruby gemstones, little lizards, and pandas, and dislikes men in general. The manga states that she once enjoyed &quot;Devilman&quot;, which the English manga changes to &quot;Buffy&quot;.

In Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon, Rei has problems trusting people, even her fellow Sailor Guardians, and has a tendency to rely too much on herself. She says that she hates karaoke (which the other girls love, especially Usagi), but is later forced by Minako into posing as an idol. As &quot;Mars Reiko,&quot; she appears on three occasions: performing for hospitalized people, working alongside Minako, and staging a contest with Minako in order to stop her from quitting the idol business. She has a complex relationship with Minako; though they often disagree and compete with each other, they also share great respect. Minako even sometimes lets her guard down around Rei, and eventually confides to her about what she feels is her destiny as a Sailor Guardian. Rei is told that she is to be the secondary leader of the Guardians, and alternately admires and resents Minako&#x27;s teachings about what that means. She later becomes aware of Mio hurting Usagi just to keep Mamoru at Beryl&#x27;s side and confronts her while in the Dark Kingdom. Rei tells her off it is her own selfishness that is encouraging Serenity to keep using the crystal and give her a choice: allow Mamoru and Usagi to see each other even for a day or she will tell her friends about Mio (which will not end well for her). Mio wisely chooses to let them see each other in order to keep Rei quiet about her. Mars uses her own dagger with Venus&#x27; to attempt to stop Serenity from destroying the Earth.

In the &quot;Special Act&quot; movie, Rei senses Mio&#x27;s return and investigates it with Luna. She is later incapacitated by Mio&#x27;s growing dark powers.

== Aspects and forms ==
As a character with different incarnations, special powers, transformations and a long lifetime virtually spanned between the Silver Millennium era and the 30th century, Rei gains multiple and aliases as the series progresses.

===Sailor Mars===
Rei&#x27;s Sailor Guardian identity is Sailor Mars. She wears a sailor suit colored in red and violet, along with red high heels, and in the manga and live-action series has a small red jewel at the waist, though this vanishes upon upgrades. (Concept art shows this was supposed to appear as a necklace when not transformed but never does) She is given specific titles throughout the various series, including Guardian of War and Guardian of Flame and Passion. Her personality is no different from when she is a civilian, although certain powers are unavailable to her in that form.

In Japanese, the name for the planet Mars is , the first kanji meaning &#x27;fire&#x27; and the second indicating a celestial object. Although the Roman planet-name is used, Sailor Mars&#x27; abilities are fire-based due to this aspect of Japanese mythology. Most are offensive attacks, although as a priestess, she also possesses a certain amount of psychic ability, and is able to do fire-readings, sense danger, and subdue evil spirits. In the manga, she is listed as the secondary leader of the Sailor Guardians, after Sailor Venus. This fact is especially significant in the live-action series.

As she grows stronger, Sailor Mars gains additional powers, and at key points her uniform changes to reflect this. The first change takes place in Act 41 of the manga, when she obtains the Mars Crystal and her outfit becomes similar to that of Super Sailor Moon. She is not given a new title. A similar event is divided between episodes 143 and 152 of the anime, and she is given the name Super Sailor Mars. A third form appears in Act 49 of the manga, unnamed but similar to Eternal Sailor Moon (without wings). In the official visual book for Sailor Moon Eternal, this form was named &quot;Eternal Sailor Mars&quot;.

===Princess Mars===
In Silver Millennium, Sailor Mars was also the Princess of her home planet. She was among those given the duty of protecting Princess Serenity of the Moon Kingdom. As Princess Mars, she lived in Phobos-Deimos Castle and wore a red gown—she appears in this form in the original manga, as well as in supplementary art. Naoko Takeuchi once drew her in the arms of Jadeite. In the manga, he expresses at least a physical attraction to her, and in &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; and in the stage musicals it is clearly stated that Sailor Mars and Jadeite were in love at the time of the Moon Kingdom.

It is revealed later in the manga that Phobos and Deimos are actually maidens from Planet Coronis sent to protect Princess Mars. They take the form of crows during the present time and were near Rei when she first came to the shrine as a child, supposedly &quot;telling&quot; her their names. Phobos and Deimos reveal their true forms when delivering the Mars Crystal to her and refer to her using her princess title.
==Special powers and items==

Rei is one of few &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; characters who is able to use special powers in her civilian form. These are mainly the result of her role as a shrine maiden, which gives her heightened spirituality as well as certain resources. In addition to some psychic talent, including occasional unprompted s, Rei is able to do fire readings and to dispel evil spirits. She does the latter by performing &quot;Kuji-Goshin-Ho&quot;, a ritual which consists of chanting nine words of power (&quot;Rin, Pyou, Tou, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen!&quot;) while making relevant hand signs. She then shouts , and throws one or multiple &quot;ofuda&quot; scrolls. She commonly uses this attack while in her Sailor Mars form as well as when she is in her civilian form.

Rei must transform into a Sailor Guardian, however, before she can access her celestial powers. She makes this change by raising a special device (pen, bracelet, wand, or crystal) into the air and shouting a special phrase, originally &quot;Mars Power, Make-up!&quot; As she becomes more powerful and obtains new transformation devices, this phrase changes to evoke Mars Star, Planet, or Crystal Power. In both anime, Sailor Mars&#x27; transformation sequence evolves slightly over time, whether to update the background images or to accommodate changes to her uniform or new transformation items, but they all involve rings of fire that circle her body as she spins, forming her outfit in a flash of light.

Sailor Mars has the power to create and control fire. Her named powers are somewhat inconsistent across the various series—in the first arc of the manga, she says &quot;Evil spirits, begone!&quot; the same phrase she uses as a civilian while using an ofuda, for her fire attacks. In the anime, she shoots a fireball from her index fingers and shouts the words &quot;Fire Soul&quot; and in the live-action series she shouts &quot;Youma Taisan&quot; (&quot;Monster, begone&quot;). This basic power is improved to &quot;Fire Soul Bird&quot; in the second arc of the anime only; the manga and &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; anime also have her develop an animal-based attack, &quot;Mars Snake Fire,&quot; but it does not appear until the third story arc and third season respectively. Her first attack to be the same across all versions is &quot;Burning Mandala,&quot; which incorporates Buddhist symbolism in the fiery rings Sailor Mars summons. She is not immune to her own powers, as she is able to use them for a suicide move in the anime.

Sailor Mars&#x27; final and greatest power comes in the fourth story arc, when she takes on her second Sailor Guardian form (Super Sailor Mars in the anime). At this point in the series, she acquires a special weapon, the Mars Arrow, and with it &quot;Mars Flame Sniper,&quot; which is her primary attack for the duration of the series. In the manga, the Mars Crystal and Mars Arrow are among her most significant mystical possessions. The former is her Sailor Crystal and the source of all of her power. The latter is associated with her skill as an archer, and although she does not receive a physical bow, she recalls some advice given to her by Michiru Kaioh—&quot;[If] you think you&#x27;re being taken advantage of by the enemies, stretch a line taut in your soul. Then, with your whole body and spirit, shoot the arrow of your finishing blow!&quot; In the live-action series, she is given a tambourine-like weapon, called the Sailor Star Tambo, by Artemis. During the final battle, her Tambo transforms into a dagger, which she uses alongside Venus&#x27;s similar dagger. In the &quot;Special Act&quot;, Venus wields both weapons.

==Development==
Rei is not named in the original proposal for a hypothetical &quot;&quot; anime, but an identical character in miko clothing is present, named Miyabi Yoruno. Creator Naoko Takeuchi revealed that this character eventually became Rei, and wrote that her role as a shrine maiden was inspired by Takeuchi&#x27;s own experience working as a miko for Shiba Daijingu Shrine while in college. She also stated that she was frequently hit on by the shrine&#x27;s patrons, a source of annoyance that carries over into the character.

Hikawa Shrine, where Rei lives and works, is based on the Hikawa Shrines, one of which is in Azabu Jūban, where the story is set. The kanji for &quot;ice&quot; in the original name (氷川神社) is replaced with the kanji for &quot;fire&quot;—a reflection of Rei&#x27;s fire-related powers.

Sailor Mars&#x27; original costume design, like the others&#x27;, was fully unique. It featured an alternate bow, double shoulder-guards, plate-armor, elaborate jewelry, and a gold-rimmed mask. Her trademark high-heeled shoes were already present, as well. Later, Takeuchi was surprised by these sketches and stated that she did not remember drawing them. In an intermediate design, the pendant that sat at her waist in the early manga was also intended to be worn as a necklace in her civilian form. Hitoshi Doi states that Kunihiko Ikuhara was responsible for much of Rei&#x27;s changed personality in the anime.

The kanji of Rei&#x27;s surname translate as and . Her given name is in katakana ; possible meanings include , , , and . Because katakana is the alphabet usually used for foreign loanwords, it may also be intended as a Western name, such as Raye (which is indeed used in American continent localizations) or Rae. In the Chinese versions of the series (anime and manga), Rei&#x27;s name is written with the character &quot;麗&quot;, which carries the same phonetic as &quot;Rei&quot;, but means &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;elegance&quot;, and, ultimately, is the one included in the 5th &quot;Original Picture Collection Volume Artbook (Vol. V)&quot; (meaning that Rei&#x27;s name written all in Kanji &quot;is&quot; &quot;火野麗&quot; (lit. &quot;Fire-Field Beauty/Elegance&quot; / &quot;Beauty/Elegance of Fire&quot;)). Regardless, the entire name is structured as a pun, as the syllable &quot;no&quot; indicates a possessive, so that her name can also be understood as &quot;Ray of Fire.&quot; Her prototypical name, , means &quot;Elegance of Night&quot; (みやび = 雅).

It has been noted that her outfit as Sailor Mars echoes the colors of her &quot;miko&quot; robes, and she is the only character that is mostly tied into tradition.

===Actresses===
In the Japanese anime television series, Rei is voiced by Michie Tomizawa, who later said that working on &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; had been &quot;exactly like magic&quot; for her. Rina Satō voices the character in &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; and all media since.

In the DIC/Cloverway English adaptations produced in association with Optimum Productions, her name was spelled as Raye Hino and was voiced by Katie Griffin, in her first voice acting role, for most of the franchise; however, Emilie-Claire Barlow filled in for the last 17 episodes of the second season while Griffin was involved in a film production. Raye was also Barlow&#x27;s first voice acting role, and she said that during recording, it was difficult to take care of her voice, as Raye &quot;had a lot of yelling.&quot; She also listened to Griffin&#x27;s recording sessions to help with the voice matching. Barlow would later become the permanent replacement voice for Sailor Venus after Griffin returned to voice Sailor Mars. Sandy Howell also provides English vocals for songs sung by Raye in the English dub.

In the Viz Media English adaptation produced in association with Studiopolis, her voice is supplied by Cristina Vee, a long-time &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; fan.

In the musical productions, Rei has been portrayed by nineteen actresses: Hiroko Nakayama, Misako Kotani, Asuka Umemiya, Hiromi Sakai, Eri Kanda, Megumi Yoshida, Aiko Kawasaki, Risa Honma, Kanon Nanaki, Karen Kobayashi., Kazumi Takayama, Ranze Terada, Kotomi Hirai, Kyoko Ninomiya, Yui Hasegawa, Seira Hayakawa, Rei Kobayashi, Hina Okamoto, and Miku Ichinose.

In &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;, Rei was played by Keiko Kitagawa. In addition, Haruhi Mizukuro and Akira Tanaka portray the younger Rei in flashbacks and childhood photos.

==Reception==

The character has been well received by manga readers. Official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; popularity polls listed Rei Hino and Sailor Mars as separate entities. In 1992, readers ranked them at thirteenth and fourteenth respectively, out of thirty eight choices. One year later, now with fifty choices, Mars remained at fourteenth most popular while Rei dropped to fifteenth. In 1994, with fifty one choices, Rei was the twentieth most popular character, whereas Sailor Mars was the twenty-second, with a gap between the two characters of over three thousand votes. In early 1996, with fifty one choices, Sailor Mars was the thirty-first most popular character and Rei was the thirty-second. In Animage&#x27;s 1993 poll, she came sixth. In 1994, she came tenth.

A five-book series was published, one book on each of the Sailor Guardians and Sailor Moon. Rei&#x27;s was released in 1996. This book was later translated into English by Mixx. The episode where Sailor Mars gained her powers was novelised by Mixx. Other merchandise has been released based on her character, including T-shirts, fashion dolls, trading card stickers, gashapon and UFO dolls.

Rei Ayanami of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; is named after Rei Hino. She has also been referenced in non-Japanese media: DC Comics character Martian Manhunter briefly assumes the form of a female Japanese journalist named Rei Hino and is told by Batman that the name is a &quot;giveaway.&quot;

<doc id="227070" wikidata="Q1048982" url="?curid=227070" title="Luna (Sailor Moon)">
<text>is a fictional character in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; media franchise. She is a black cat who has the ability to talk, and serves as a mentoring figure for the titular character and her companions, the Sailor Guardians. Luna makes her debut in the first act or episode of each version of the series, in which she meets Usagi Tsukino and tells her she is Sailor Moon, and gives her a brooch that allows her to transform. Luna features prominently in the first story arc, and although she becomes a supporting character for the rest of the series, she keeps providing the Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask with advice, her family relationships are explored alongside her partner Artemis and their daughter from the future Diana, and she even manages to transform into a human being at key points of the series (including the ability to transform into a Sailor Guardian in the 2003 live-action series).

==Profile==
Luna first appears in the series as a mysterious black cat with a crescent moon mark on the forehead that meets Usagi and tells her she is Sailor Moon, a Guardian destined to fight evil. Luna gives Usagi the mission to find her fellow Sailor Guardians and Princess Serenity, whom, unbeknown to both of them, is Usagi herself. The two of them meet Ami Mizuno, Rei Hino, and Makoto Kino, whom Luna assist to awake respectively as Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, and Sailor Jupiter, before encountering Sailor Venus and Artemis, a male white cat that also has the ability to speak and who has been secretly providing Luna with details on her mission.

Halfway through the first arc, Luna&#x27;s backstory is revealed: in the Silver Millennium, she was a servant to Princess Serenity, sworn never to leave her side, as well as an advisor to her mother, Queen Serenity. When the Moon Kingdom fell at the hands of the Dark Kingdom, she and Artemis were put into a long sleep and sent down to Earth to look after the Sailor Guardians, who would eventually be reborn there. Part of Luna&#x27;s memory was suppressed, in order to make her task easier; she only knew that she was supposed to find and awaken the Sailor Guardians of the inner Solar System. Further details on Luna and Artemis&#x27; origin are revealed in the final arc of the manga, in which it is stated they were born in Planet Mau, home planet of the evil Sailor Tin Nyanko.

Over the course of the series, Luna develops a close bond with Usagi, though early on it is on uneasy terms, as Luna often upsets Usagi by giving her advice she does not want, often leading to comic results. The whole Tsukino family adopts her as a pet, even when they are unaware of her true identity. In an anime-only storyline, Shingo Tsukino is shown to be reluctant to accept Luna at first, and his animosity is enhanced by an attack from the Dark Kingdom; however, at the end of the episode, he seems to be friendly towards her. Luna also becomes good friends with Ami. Luna and Artemis have an implied romantic relationship, which is confirmed when they meet Diana, who is their daughter from the future. During the &quot;Sailor Stars&quot; anime, Luna also develops a crush on Kou Yaten, the male civilian form of one of the Sailor Starlights.

In the live-action series, Luna is portrayed as a stuffed toy rather than a real cat. Usually she is represented by a puppet, though CGI effects are used for complicated scenes.

== Aspects and forms ==
Even when Luna does not have as many incarnations and special powers as the Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask, she nonetheless manages to get some transformations, as well as a long lifetime virtually spanned between the Silver Millennium era and the 30th century.

===Human form===

The character is first shown to get the ability to transform into a human being in the manga special &quot;The Lover of Princess Kaguya&quot;, which was released a month after the end of the third arc of the series. In this side story, Luna falls in love with a human named Kakeru. It is stated that Kakeru&#x27;s wish is to meet Princess Kaguya someday. During the climax of the story, Sailor Moon uses the Silver Crystal to transform Luna into a human woman. At first, Kakeru thinks this woman is Kaguya, but then he notices Luna&#x27;s crescent moon mark in her forehead and realizes it is her. This side story was adapted into &quot;Sailor Moon S: The Movie&quot;, which marks Luna&#x27;s only transformation into a human in the first anime adaptation.

Luna&#x27;s human form appears in the main story timeline in the climax of the &quot;Dream&quot; arc, after Queen Nehelenia&#x27;s defeat, alongside Artemis and Diana, who also appear in their human forms. The three of them appear once more as humans in the final arc, when Tin Nyanko attacks them.

In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, the second anime adaptation, Luna&#x27;s human form appears earlier during the climatic battle against Queen Metalia, in which Artemis spots her praying on the Moon in this form.

===Sailor Luna===
In Act 27 of the live-action series, Luna gains the ability to turn into a young human girl, given the name , and is able to transform into , the &quot;Guardian of Love and Small Things.&quot; Her uniform is colored in yellow and purple, along with purple boots with white fur atop of them as well as in the sleeves, a jingle bell instead of a brooch, and a cat ear motif in her dark blue hair. Luna&#x27;s personality as a human girl is essentially identical to her normal self, except that she has a mild obsession with sweet foods and behaves more like a real cat, in that she runs from dogs and is easily distracted by toys. She also has heightened hearing and is able to move extremely quickly. Luna involuntarily transforms back into a plushie under certain circumstances such as sneezing, taking a direct attack from an enemy, or falling unconscious.

In the &quot;Special Act&quot; epilogue, Luna is the only one of the Guardians who is still able to transform without outside assistance. She is also shown living mainly as a human with Usagi&#x27;s family, with whom she gets along quite well, though she still takes on her cat form when necessary. She is also shown to have taken on some of the personality traits of Usagi and her mother, such as acting in the same melodramatic manner when waking up in the morning.

==Special powers and items==
Luna&#x27;s most distinctive power is her ability to talk like and communicate with human beings. This trait is only shared by Artemis and their daughter Diana. In all versions of the series, Luna provides the Sailor Guardians with many of their special items, particularly early on. The items always spring into existence, seemingly out of thin air, and it is unclear whether she is creating them herself or simply transporting them from some other location. Luna is also shown to be capable of handling machines, as shown when she accesses a secret laboratory below Game Center Crown, or an arcade machine in the first anime adaptation. The first time Luna manages to transform into a human is thanks to the power of the Silver Crystal; however, in subsequent appearances, she transforms by herself. Human Luna gains additional powers such as the ability to fly, to teleport herself and others, and is even capable of surviving in the vacuum of space. Luna loses all of these powers if the crescent moon mark on her forehead is hit by an attack, as shown when she, Artemis, and Diana are struck by Tin Nyanko, which renders them as normal cats. It is also stated by Princess Kakyuu in the final arc that Luna&#x27;s Star Seed is almost as powerful as a Sailor Crystal.

In the live-action series, Luna uses a special cell phone named Lunatia L to transform into Sailor Luna, by dialing 6-7-2 and shouting &quot;Luna Prism Power, Make up!&quot;. In this form, she uses a special attack called &quot;Luna Sucre Candy&quot; which bombards an enemy in exploding sweets. Her main weapon is the &quot;Moonlight Stick&quot;, which looks identical to Sailor Moon&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Stick&quot; from the same series and which she can transform into various other objects, such as a paper fan or a butterfly net.

==Development==

The concept of a talking cat guiding a schoolgirl to becoming a Sailor Guardian first occurs in &quot;&quot;, Takeuchi&#x27;s manga series that served as the basis for its successor &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; in which Artemis appears before Minako to reveal to her she has been chosen as &quot;Sailor V&quot; to protect Earth. When &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot; was proposed for an anime adaptation, the story was revisioned so that it would eventually become &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, and the talking cat role would result in Luna.

Luna has blue eyes in the manga, the live-action series, and in the &quot;Sailor Moon Eternal&quot; film, but red eyes in both anime TV series. In the &quot;Materials Collection&quot;, Takeuchi describes Luna&#x27;s whiskers as long, and the character shares her page with Artemis, whom the author labels as opposite to Luna, though being her &quot;other half&quot;. Luna and Artemis also share their page with an unused character called &quot;Diana the Moon Fairy&quot;, whom Luna does not like very much. This character never appears in the series, but her name was given to Luna and Artemis&#x27; daughter. Though Luna&#x27;s age is never discussed in any version of the series, Takeuchi states in the &quot;Materials Collection&quot; that Luna&#x27;s human form appears to be a year younger than Usagi and goes on to describe her as frail, as if she had recently lost a lot of weight. The author says her hair is the same color as her cat form&#x27;s fur—blackish-gray—with two &quot;odangos&quot; in either side of her head.

The character of Sailor Luna was designed by Takeuchi herself. One of the only times she appears in an outfit other than those Takeuchi designed—her Guardian uniform or her purple shirt and yellow skirt—is in the Special Act, where she serves as the flower girl at Usagi and Mamoru&#x27;s wedding.

Luna&#x27;s name comes from the Latin word for Earth&#x27;s Moon. Luna is also the divine embodiment of the Moon in the ancient Roman religion.

===Actresses===
In the original anime, as well as the live-action series, Luna is voiced by Keiko Han, the same woman who voiced Queen Beryl. Her English voice actress for the entire series was Jill Frappier, who portrayed the character with an English accent, described as &quot;fairly old, not to mention cranky and British&quot;. In the live-action series, Sailor Luna is played by Rina Koike, who thought that she was going to play Chibiusa until she went in for a costume fitting. However, Chibiusa never appears in &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;. Ryō Hirohashi has voiced Luna in all media following &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, while Michelle Ruff has portrayed the character in the English dub of this version. In the stage musicals, Luna has been portrayed by Tomoko Ishimura (1993-1994), Misato Matsumoto (2018-2019), Hiroko Wakasa (2018), Yune Sakurai (2021; cat form), and Marisa (2021; Human Form).

==Reception and influence==
In the first official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; character popularity poll, Luna was the eighth most popular character out of thirty eight choices. One year later, now with fifty choices, Luna was the twenty-second most popular character. Her role in the series has been compared to Rupert Giles&#x27; in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Writer Mary Grigsby considers Luna, along with the other cat characters, to blend pre-modern ideas about feminine mystery with modern ideas such as the lucky cat. In his review of season 1 episode &quot;Loved and Chased! Luna&#x27;s Worst Day Ever&quot;, Michael Mammano from &quot;Den of Geek&quot; thought that a Luna-centric episode &quot;would have come earlier in the show&quot; and that very little of Luna&#x27;s background is known, considering her pivotal role in the series. In a review of &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, Meghan Sullivan from IGN pointed that there are &quot;weird issues&quot; regarding Luna&#x27;s role, particularly how the character &quot;remembered being from the moon, but couldn&#x27;t remember what the moon princess looks like?&quot; However, on a review of a later act, the author praised the &quot;growing friendship between Luna and Usagi&quot;, and how the latter defended the former when the brainwashed Mamoru attacked her. In her review of the season finale, Sullivan stated that voice actress Ryo Hirohashi &quot;did an amazing job expressing helplessness and despair as Luna watched Metalia steamroll over everyone and everything back on Earth.&quot; In her reviews of &quot;Crystal&quot;, Gabriella Ekens from Anime News Network stated that series was &quot;poorly animated&quot; and that &quot;Luna sometimes looks more like a horse than a cat.&quot; In her review of the act in which Artemis and Sailor Venus made their debut, Ekens considered that &quot;Artemis consistently looks more like a cat than Luna, sometimes even while they&#x27;re in the same shot.&quot;

===Appearances in other media===
Luna is featured in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; crossover video games &quot;Nakayoshi to Issho&quot; and &quot;Welcome Nakayoshi Park&quot;. In a collaboration between &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and Capcom as part of the 25th anniversary celebration of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; franchise, the Felyne cat companion assumes the form of Luna and wields Usagi&#x27;s Cutie Moon Rod weapon in the &quot;Monster Hunter XX&quot; expansion of &quot;Monster Hunter Generations&quot;.

In the second episode of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race: UK Versus the World&quot;, American contestant Mo Heart&#x27;s look for the &quot;Kitty Girl&quot; runway theme was as Luna, which according to Andy Swift from &quot;TVLine&quot;, was among the most incredible of the week.

<doc id="227075" wikidata="Q5972133" url="?curid=227075" title="IMX (TV series)">
<text>IMX (Interactive Music Exchange) was an American music television program that aired daily from 2002 to 2004 on MMUSA (renamed Fuse TV in May 2003). Described as a &quot;fully converged music industry simulation game&quot; and &quot;part TV show, part Internet game,&quot; the program asked viewers to register at the network&#x27;s website and buy &quot;stock&quot; in popular artists, songs, and albums. In dealing the &quot;shares&quot;, traders used the fake cash to enter network-sponsored contests. A rebranded successor, &quot;Daily Download&quot;, was terminated in July 2006.

==Format==
&quot;IMX&quot; was in development for nearly a year prior to its January 2003 debut. In a 2002 press release, network president Marc Juris discussed the inspiration behind the program: 
:&quot;MuchMusic USA&#x27;s mission is to provide its viewers with a real voice. What better way for a viewer&#x27;s voice to be heard than by investing in an artist he or she loves? Our success and growth over the last year has occurred because we recognize that viewers want ownership and control of what they listen to and watch. We have developed technology that empowers our audience to create their own videos, select our video rotation, and even to host the shows we broadcast. Both the &quot;IMX&quot; program and game is the next step in this endeavor, by encompassing the technological advances of the web, the popularity of online games, and the potential of live television.&quot;

&quot;IMX&quot; featured three VJ hosts, each representing different music genres, as well as a guest from the music industry. It debuted on January 20, 2003 at 6pm EST and would air live Monday through Friday with various encores throughout the week. The IMX studio, located in Penn Plaza, was street level and therefore fans that couldn&#x27;t get tickets were able to view from outside and would be visible through the window during filming.

In attempt to &quot;extol the fun of the stock market,&quot; players would sign up online and be given a set amount of &quot;IMX dollars&quot; in order to buy stocks in artists, albums, videos, and TV offerings, which could be traded and sold short or for profit online. With such profits, players could win prizes like video game consoles, vacations, surfboards, or lithographs, all brought to them by Virgin Records. Stock values would be influenced largely by &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, concert sales, and other measures of commercial success.

Fixed to the bottom of the screen would be a market style ticker, updating viewers on how each artist, album, or song fared during the day&#x27;s trading. Users could voice their opinions on the online bulletin boards, and their messages would frequently be shown live on air. Through the website, they would also be provided with music video previews, music downloads, and a wide range of market research tools for the individual portfolios of game participants, including airplay stats and sales charts. The one-hour program would help recap the day&#x27;s trading, the value of each featured artist and song, and speculate on the future of the market.

&quot;IMX&quot; utilized the interactive investment technology of Hollywood Stock Exchange to allow web users to invest in real time. Marc Juris elaborated on the technological potential of the innovative format:
:&quot;&quot;IMX&quot; is like fantasy football, but with rock stars. The applications it can embrace are infinitely broad - from broadband and the digital set-top box to wireless devices and e-commerce. It&#x27;s a new kind of entertainment experience that will captivate our tech-centric young viewers, and also cable operators who are eager to drive the demand for digital set-top boxes and high-speed services.&quot;

==Hosts and guests==
The show was hosted by Juliya Chernetsky of &quot;Uranium&quot;; Marianela Pereyra, who previously hosted Latin television&#x27;s &quot;MHz HOT&quot;; and Steven Smith, formerly a VH1 personality. Dennis Da Menace (a.k.a. Dennis L.A. White) also frequently took up hosting duties in one&#x27;s absence, usually Juliya&#x27;s. Each host reflected different musical tastes with Juliya representing heavy metal, Marianela representing R&amp;B, Steven representing indie/alternative rock, and Dennis representing hip hop. This allowed for frequent debate and friendly argument amongst the differing hosts. It was also during &quot;IMX&quot; that Juliya was confronted by her fellow hosts about false rumors that she might jump ship to MTV2 to host its revived &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

Joining the diverse trio each day would be a variety of music industry insiders, ranging from current popular musicians to record company executives to music journalists. The program would also feature live in-studio performances following an interview with the given band. One particularly memorable episode saw Amy Lee and Ben Moody of Evanescence perform an acoustic rendition of &quot;Going Under&quot;. Partly through the song, a string broke on Moody&#x27;s guitar and caused the song to end prematurely.

==&quot;Daily Download&quot;==

In June 2004, &quot;IMX&quot; was rebranded Daily Download with an altered format. This series took place in the same studio and maintained the same schedule with Marianela, Steven, and Dylan Lane as hosts; however, the stock exchange aspect of &quot;IMX&quot; was removed in favor of a simpler interactive format. &quot;Daily Download&quot; served as a &quot;live countdown show for the next generation,&quot; featuring the 10 most-downloaded songs in the country. It also offered free downloads of each song provided by f.y.e. as well as game cheats and movie trailers. The videos aired would include &quot;Fuse Clues&quot; that related to online puzzles of music and pop culture at the network&#x27;s website, fuse.tv. Using a mobile phone or the Web, fans could solve the puzzles and be eligible to win prizes. Viewers also had the opportunity to talk to guest musicians appearing on the program.

&quot;Daily Download&quot; ran for about two years before ending in late July 2006. Marianela appeared on &quot;Get Malled Tour&quot; before ultimately leaving Fuse TV that year, and Dylan became the new host of GSN&#x27;s &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; on August 1. Steven, however, would remain with Fuse TV and host other programs including &quot;Steven&#x27;s Untitled Rock Show&quot;.

<text>William Thornton (May 20, 1759 – March 28, 1828) was an American physician, inventor, painter and architect who designed the United States Capitol. He also served as the first Architect of the Capitol and first Superintendent of the United States Patent Office.

==Early life==
From an early age, William Thornton displayed interest and discernible talent in &quot;the arts of design,&quot; to employ an 18th-century term that is particularly useful in assessing his career. Thornton was born on Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands, West Indies, in a Quaker community. where he was heir to sugar plantations. He was sent to England at age five to be educated. Thornton was brought up strictly by his father&#x27;s relations, Quakers and merchants, in and near the ancient castle town of Lancaster, in northern Lancashire, England. There was never any question of his pursuing the fine arts professionally—he was to be trained for a useful life, according to the Quaker ways. Thus, despite the fact that he had a sizeable income, young Thornton was apprenticed for a term of four years (1777–1781), to a practical physician and apothecary in Ulverston, Lancashire (now Cumbria).
The earliest of Thornton&#x27;s known writings, a journal he began during his apprenticeship, records almost as many entries for drawing and sketching as notes on medical treatments and nostrums. His subjects were most often flora and fauna, but he also did portraits, landscapes, historical scenes, and studies of machinery, such as the Franklin stove, and managed to construct a camera obscura. This pattern continued when he enrolled as a medical student in the University of Edinburgh in 1781. He interned at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. The architecture of Edinburgh, especially that of the New Town that was being built, surely exerted considerable influence. More direct evidence of his interest in architecture is found in the landscapes and sketches of castles he drew while travelling about Scotland, notably in the Highlands, during these years.

In 1783, Thornton went to London to continue his medical studies; characteristically, he also found time to attend lectures at the Royal Academy. The following year he was off to the Continent, carrying a letter of introduction to Benjamin Franklin, (1706–1790), written by his mentor and distant cousin John Coakley Lettsome, (1744–1815). 
In the summer of 1784, he explored the Highlands with French geologist Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond.
He received his medical degree in 1784 at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.

Thornton then spent time in Paris, before returning to Tortola in 1786. There, he saw his mother for the first time since boyhood, where he came face to face with the source of his income—half interest in a sugar plantation and ownership of some 70 slaves, the possession of whom had begun to trouble him.

Eager to achieve fame (and undoubtedly some expiation) in the cause of anti-slavery, he emigrated to the United States of America in the fall of 1786, moving to Philadelphia. His unsuccessful efforts to lead a contingent of free black Americans to join the small British settlement of London blacks at the mouth of the Sierra Leone River in West Africa were looked on favorably by Philadelphia&#x27;s Quaker establishment. Some leaders of the new republic—notably James Madison, with whom he lodged at Mrs. Mary House&#x27;s prominent boarding establishment in 1787 and 1788—were cognizant of Thornton&#x27;s abolitionist activities. However, after moving to the City of Washington, he took advantage of slavery. According to a diary his wife kept in 1800, he frequently shopped for slaves and bought and hired them. In 1788, he became an American citizen. Thornton married Anna Maria Brodeau, daughter of a schoolteacher, in 1790.

==Architect==

===United States Capitol===

In 1789, after briefly practicing medicine and pursuing an interest in steamboats, Thornton submitted a design to the architectural competition for the Library Company of Philadelphia&#x27;s new hall. His design won but was somewhat departed from during actual construction. Library Hall was described as the first building in the &quot;modern [classical] style&quot; to be erected in the new nation&#x27;s leading city.

During his visit to Tortola between October 1790 and October 1792, Thornton learned of the design competitions for the U.S. Capitol and the &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot; to be erected in the new Federal City on the banks of the Potomac. Because a design for the Capitol had not been chosen, he was allowed to compete upon his return to Philadelphia. Between July and November 1792, the Washington administration examined closely the designs submitted by the French émigré architect Etienne Sulpice Hallet, (1755-1825), and Judge George Turner. Hallet and Turner had been summoned to the Federal City in August 1792 to present their ideas to the &quot;Commissioners of the District of Columbia&quot; and local landholders. Both were then encouraged to submit revisions of their designs to accommodate new conditions and requirements. At the beginning of November, Turner&#x27;s new designs were rejected.

The painter John Trumbull handed in William Thornton&#x27;s still &quot;unfinished&quot; revised plan of the Capitol building on January 29, 1793, but the President&#x27;s formal approbation was not recorded until April 2, 1793. Thornton was inspired by the east front of the Louvre, former royal palace later turned art museum, as well as the Pantheon, famed former Roman temple in Roma and later converted to a Christian church, for the center portion of the design. After more drawings were prepared, enthusiastic praise of Thornton&#x27;s design was echoed by Secretary of State Jefferson: &quot;simple, noble, beautiful, excellently distributed.&quot; For his winning design, Thornton received a prize of $500 and a city lot.

The execution of the design was entrusted to the supervision of Étienne Sulpice Hallet and James Hoban, (1758-1831), (who had also submitted designs for the &quot;President&#x27;s House - later the White House). Hallet proceeded to make numerous revisions, including removing the rotunda under which Washington was to be enshrined upon his death. So, on September 12, 1794 the President appointed Thornton as one of the three &quot;Commissioners of the Federal District&quot; in charge of laying out the new federal city and overseeing construction of the first government buildings, including the Capitol of which he became supervisor and remained in charge until 1802. Despite important changes and additions, (especially the substitution of a lower copper-clad wooden dome during the 1820s to 1856, for Thornton&#x27;s original design), especially by second Architect of the Capitol, Latrobe and third Architect Bulfinch, much of the design of the façade of the central portion of the Capitol is his.

===Other works===


As a consequence of winning the Capitol competition, Thornton was frequently asked to give ideas for public and residential buildings in the Federal City. He responded with designs on several occasions during his tenure as a commissioner, less so after 1802 when he took on the superintendency of the Patent Office.

It was during this time he was asked to design a mansion for Colonel John Tayloe. The Tayloe House, also known as The Octagon House, in Washington, D.C., was erected between 1799 and 1800. It served as a temporary &quot;Executive Mansion&quot; after the 1814 burning of the White House by the British and the house&#x27;s study was where President Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812. In 1899, the building was acquired by the American Institute of Architects, whose national headquarters now nestles behind it.

Around 1800, he designed Woodlawn for Major Lawrence Lewis (nephew of George Washington) and his wife, Eleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis (granddaughter of Martha Washington), on of Mount Vernon land. Sometime around 1808, he designed Tudor Place for Thomas Peter and his wife, Martha Parke Custis Peter (another granddaughter of Martha Washington).

===National Register===
Many buildings designed by Thornton have been added to the National Register of Historic Places including:
* Library Company of Philadelphia, 5th &amp; Chestnut Sts., Philadelphia, PA; 1789 (demolished 1887; recreated as Library Hall, American Philosophical Society, 1954)
* United States Capitol, Washington, D.C.; 1793 - exempt
* Prospect Hill, NE of Long Green on Kanes Road, Baltimore, MD; 1796-1798 - added to registry in 1973
* Prospect House, 3508 Prospect Street NW, Washington, D.C. - added in 1972
* Octagon House, 1741 New York Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C.; 1799 - added in 1966
* Woodlawn, W of jct. of U.S. 1 and Rte. 235, Fairfax, VA, 1800-05 - added in 1970
* Tudor Place, 1644 31st Street, NW, Washington, D.C.; 1816 - added in 1966

==Founding of the Washington Jockey Club==

In 1802, the Club sought a new site for its track, which at the time lay at the rear of what is now the site of Decatur House at H Street and Jackson Place, crossing Seventeenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue to Twentieth Street (today the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) was being overtaken by the growth of the Federal City. With the leadership of John Tayloe III and Charles Carnan Ridgely and support of Gen. John Peter Van Ness, William Thornton, G.W. P. Custis, John D. Threlkeld of Georgetown and George Calvert of Riversdale, Bladensburg, Maryland, the contests were moved to a new site near Meridian Hill, north of Columbia Road at Fourteenth Street, between present-day Eleventh and Sixteenth Streets. Thornton designed this new track, one mile in circumference, and named it the Washington City Race Course. It sat on land leased from the Holmead family, and lasted until the mid-1840s.

==Superintendent of the Patent Office==
Upon the abolition of the board of Commissioners of the Federal City in 1802, President Jefferson appointed Thornton the first Superintendent of the Patent Office. When Washington was burned by the British in 1814, Thornton convinced them not to burn the Patent Office because of its importance to mankind. He held the position from June 1, 1802, until his death in 1828 in Washington, DC. During his tenure, he introduced innovations including the patent reissue practice, which survives to this day.

Some of Thornton&#x27;s reputation as an inventor is due to abuse of his position in the Patent Office.
His improvements to John Fitch&#x27;s 1788 steamboat are patented but didn&#x27;t work. 

When John Hall applied for a patent on a new breech-loading rifle in 1811, Thornton claimed he had also invented it. As proof, he showed Hall a Ferguson rifle, a British gun dating from 1776, refusing to issue the patent unless it was in his name as well as Hall&#x27;s name.
==Societies==

In 1787, Thornton was elected to the American Philosophical Society. During the 1820s, Thornton was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.

==Later life==

In the 1820s, Thornton wrote of having been summoned to Mount Vernon in December 1799, in the hopes that he would be able to treat George Washington, but of having arrived after Washington&#x27;s death; as a result, he devised a plan to resurrect Washington&#x27;s frozen corpse by (f)irst to thaw him in cold water, then to lay him in blankets, &amp; by degrees &amp; by friction to give him warmth, and to put into activity the minute blood vessels, at the same time to open a passage to the Lungs by the Trachaea, and to inflate them with air, to produce an artificial respiration, and to transfuse blood into him from a lamb. Thornton&#x27;s plan was rejected, however, despite &quot;there (being) no doubt in (Thornton&#x27;s) mind that (Washington&#x27;s) restoration was possible.&quot;

Thornton died in 1828 and was buried in Congressional Cemetery in eastern Washington, DC.

<text>A waverider is a hypersonic aircraft design that improves its supersonic lift-to-drag ratio by using the shock waves being generated by its own flight as a lifting surface, a phenomenon known as compression lift. 

The waverider remains a well-studied design for high-speed aircraft in the Mach 5 and higher hypersonic regime, although no such design has yet entered production. The Boeing X-51 scramjet demonstration aircraft was tested from 2010 to 2013. In its final test flight, it reached a speed of .

==History==

===Early work===
The waverider design concept was first developed by Terence Nonweiler of the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, and first described in print in 1951 as a re-entry vehicle. It consisted of a delta-wing platform with a low wing loading to provide considerable surface area to dump the heat of re-entry. At the time, Nonweiler was forced to use a greatly simplified 2D model of airflow around the aircraft, which he realized would not be accurate due to flow across the wing. However, he also noticed that the spanwise flow would be stopped by the shockwave being generated by the aircraft, and that if the wing was positioned to deliberately approach the shock, the spanwise flow would be trapped under wing, increasing pressure, and thus increasing lift.

In the 1950s, the British started a space program based around the Blue Streak missile, which was, at some point, to include a crewed vehicle. Armstrong-Whitworth were contracted to develop the re-entry vehicle, and unlike the U.S. space program, they decided to stick with a winged vehicle instead of a ballistic capsule. Between 1957 and 1959, they contracted Nonweiler to develop his concepts further. This work produced a pyramid-shaped design with a flat underside and short wings. Heat was conducted through the wings to the upper cool surfaces, where it was dumped into the turbulent air on the top of the wing. In 1960, work on the Blue Streak was canceled as the missile was seen as being obsolete before it could have entered service. Work then moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), where it continued as a research program into high-speed (Mach 4 to 7) civilian airliners.

This work was discovered by engineers at North American Aviation during the early design studies of what would lead to the XB-70 bomber. They re-designed the original &quot;classic&quot; delta wing to incorporate drooping wing tips in order to trap the shock waves mechanically, rather than using a shock cone generated from the front of the aircraft. This mechanism also had two other beneficial effects; it reduced the amount of horizontal lifting surface at the rear of the aircraft, which helped offset a nose-down trim that occurs at high speeds, and it added more vertical surface which helped improve the directional stability, which decreased at high speed.

===Caret wing===
Nonweiler&#x27;s original design used the shock wave generated by the aircraft as a way to control spanwise flow, and thereby increase the amount of air trapped under the wing in the same way as a wing fence. While working on these concepts, he noticed that it was possible to shape the wing in such a way that the shock wave generated off its leading edge would form a horizontal sheet under the craft. In this case, the airflow would not only be trapped horizontally, spanwise, but vertically as well. The only area the air above the shock wave could escape would be out the back of the sheet where the fuselage ended. Since the air was trapped between this sheet and the fuselage, a large volume of air would be trapped, much more than the more basic approach he first developed. Furthermore, since the shock surface was held at a distance from the craft, shock heating was limited to the leading edges of the wings, lowering the thermal loads on the fuselage.

In 1962 Nonweiler moved to Glasgow University to become Professor of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. That year his &quot;Delta Wings of Shapes Amenable to Exact Shock-Wave Theory&quot; was published by the &quot;Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society&quot;, and earned him that society&#x27;s Gold Medal. A craft generated using this model looks like a delta wing that has been broken down the center and the two sides folded downward. From the rear it looks like an upside-down V, or alternately, the &quot;caret&quot;, ^, and such designs are known as &quot;caret wings&quot;. Two to three years later the concept briefly came into the public eye, due to the airliner work at the RAE that led to the prospect of reaching Australia in 90 minutes. Newspaper articles led to an appearance on Scottish Television.

Hawker Siddeley examined the caret wing waverider in the later 1960s as a part of a three-stage lunar rocket design. The first stage was built on an expanded Blue Steel, the second a waverider, and the third a nuclear-powered crewed stage. This work was generalized in 1971 to produce a two-staged reusable spacecraft. The long first stage was designed as a classical waverider, with air-breathing propulsion for return to the launch site. The upper stage was designed as a lifting body, and would have carried an 8000-pound (3.6 t) payload to low Earth orbit.

===Cone flow waveriders===
Nonweiler&#x27;s work was based on studies of planar 2D shocks due to the difficulty understanding and predicting real-world shock patterns around 3D bodies. As the study of hypersonic flows improved, researchers were able to study waverider designs that used different shockwave shapes, the simplest being the conical shock generated by a cone. In these cases, a waverider is designed to keep the rounded shockwave attached to its wings, not a flat sheet, which increases the volume of air trapped under the surface, and thereby increases lift.

Unlike the caret wing, the cone flow designs smoothly curve their wings, from near horizontal in the center, to highly drooped where they meet the shock. Like the caret wing, they have to be designed to operate at a specific speed to properly attach the shock wave to the wing&#x27;s leading edge, but unlike them the entire body shape can be varied dramatically at the different design speeds, and sometimes have wingtips that curve upward to attach to the shockwave.

Further development of the conical sections, adding canopies and fuselage areas, led to the &quot;osculating cones waverider&quot;, which develops several conical shock waves at different points on the body, blending them to produce a single shaped shock. The expansion to a wider range of compression surface flows allowed the design of waveriders with control of volume, upper surface shape, engine integration and centre of pressure position. Performance improvements and off-design analysis continued until 1970.

During this period at least one waverider was tested at the Woomera Rocket Range, mounted on the nose of an air-launched Blue Steel missile, and a number of airframes were tested in the wind tunnel at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center. However, during the 1970s most work in hypersonics disappeared, and the waverider along with it.

===Viscous optimized waveriders===
One of the many differences between supersonic and hypersonic flight concerns the interaction of the boundary layer and the shock waves generated from the nose of the aircraft. Normally the boundary layer is quite thin compared to the streamline of airflow over the wing, and can be considered separately from other aerodynamic effects. However, as the speed increases and the shock wave increasingly approaches the sides of the craft, there comes a point where the two start to interact and the flowfield becomes very complex. Long before that point, the boundary layer starts to interact with the air trapped between the shock wave and the fuselage, the air that is being used for lift on a waverider.

Calculating the effects of these interactions was beyond the abilities of aerodynamics until the introduction of useful computational fluid dynamics starting in the 1980s. In 1981, Maurice Rasmussen at the University of Oklahoma started a waverider renaissance by publishing a paper on a new 3D underside shape using these techniques. These shapes have superior lifting performance and less drag. Since then, whole families of cone-derived waveriders have been designed using more and more complex conic shocks, based on more complex software. This work eventually led to a conference in 1989, the &quot;First International Hypersonic Waverider Conference&quot;, held at the University of Maryland.

These newest shapes, the &quot;viscous optimized waveriders&quot;, look similar to conical designs as long as the angle of the shock wave on the nose is beyond some critical angle, about 14 degrees for a Mach 6 design for instance. The angle of the shock can be controlled by widening out the nose into a curved plate of specific radius, and reducing the radius produces a smaller shock cone angle. Vehicle design starts by selecting a given angle and then developing the body shape that traps that angle, then repeating this process for different angles. For any given speed, a single shape will generate the best results.

==Design==
During re-entry, hypersonic vehicles generate lift only from the underside of the fuselage. The underside, which is inclined to the flow at a high angle of attack, creates lift in reaction to the vehicle wedging the airflow downwards. The amount of lift is not particularly high, compared to a traditional wing, but more than enough to maneuver given the amount of distance the vehicle covers.

Most re-entry vehicles have been based on the blunt-nose reentry design pioneered by Theodore von Kármán. He demonstrated that a shock wave is forced to &quot;detach&quot; from a curved surface, forced out into a larger configuration that requires considerable energy to form. Energy expended in forming this shock wave is no longer available as heat, so this shaping can dramatically reduce the heat load on the spacecraft. Such a design has been the basis for almost every re-entry vehicle since, found on the blunt noses of the early ICBM warheads, the bottoms of the various NASA capsules, and the large nose of the Space Shuttle.

The problem with the blunt-nose system is that the resulting design creates very little lift, meaning the vehicle has problems maneuvering during re-entry. If the spacecraft is meant to be able to return to its point of launch &quot;on command&quot;, then some sort of maneuvering will be required to counteract the fact that the Earth is turning under the spacecraft as it flies. After a single low Earth orbit, the launching point will be over to the east of the spacecraft by the time it has completed one full orbit. A considerable amount of research was dedicated to combining the blunt-nose system with wings, leading to the development of the lifting body designs in the U.S.

It was while working on one such design that Nonweiler developed the waverider. He noticed that the detachment of the shock wave over the blunt leading edges of the wings of the Armstrong-Whitworth design would allow the air on the bottom of the craft to flow spanwise and escape to the upper part of the wing through the gap between the leading edge and the detached shock wave. This loss of airflow reduced (by up to a quarter) the lift being generated by the waverider, which led to studies on how to avoid this problem and keep the flow trapped under the wing.

Nonweiler&#x27;s resulting design is a delta-wing with some amount of negative dihedral — the wings are bent down from the fuselage towards the tips. When viewed from the front, the wing resembles a caret symbol () in cross section, and these designs are often referred to as carets. The more modern 3D version typically looks like a rounded letter &#x27;M&#x27;. Theoretically, a star-shaped waverider with a frontal cross-section of a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;×&quot; could reduce drag by another 20%. The disadvantage of this design is that it has more area in contact with the shock wave and therefore has more pronounced heat dissipation problems.

Waveriders generally have sharp noses and sharp leading edges on their wings. The underside shock-surface remains attached to this. Air flowing in through the shock surface is trapped between the shock and the fuselage, and can only escape at the rear of the fuselage. With sharp edges, all the lift is retained.

Even though sharp edges get much hotter than rounded ones at the same air density, the improved lift means that waveriders can glide on re-entry at much higher altitudes where the air density is lower. A list ranking various space vehicles in order of heating applied to the airframe would have capsules at the top (re-entering quickly with very high heating loads), waveriders at the bottom (extremely long gliding profiles at high altitude), and the Space Shuttle somewhere in the middle.

Simple waveriders have substantial design problems. First, the obvious designs only work at a particular Mach number, and the amount of lift captured will change dramatically as the vehicle changes speed. Another problem is that the waverider depends on radiative cooling, possible as long as the vehicle spends most of its time at very high altitudes. However these altitudes also demand a very large wing to generate the needed lift in the thin air, and that same wing can become rather unwieldy at lower altitudes and speeds.

Because of these problems, waveriders have not found favor with practical aerodynamic designers, despite the fact that they might make long-distance hypersonic vehicles efficient enough to carry air freight.

Some researchers controversially claim that there are designs that overcome these problems. One candidate for a multi-speed waverider is a &quot;caret wing&quot;, operated at different angles of attack. A caret wing is a delta wing with longitudinal conical or triangular slots or strakes. It strongly resembles a paper airplane or rogallo wing. The correct angle of attack would become increasingly precise at higher Mach numbers, but this is a control problem that is theoretically solvable. The wing is said to perform even better if it can be constructed of tight mesh, because that reduces its drag, while maintaining lift. Such wings are said to have the unusual attribute of operating at a wide range of Mach numbers in different fluids with a wide range of Reynolds numbers.

The temperature problem can be solved with some combination of a transpiring surface, exotic materials, and possibly heat-pipes. In a transpiring surface, small amounts of a coolant such as water are pumped through small holes in the aircraft&#x27;s skin (see transpiration and perspiration). This design works for Mach 25 spacecraft re-entry shields, and therefore should work for any aircraft that can carry the weight of the coolant. Exotic materials such as carbon-carbon composite do not conduct heat but endure it, but they tend to be brittle. Heatpipes are not widely used at present. Like a conventional heat exchanger, they conduct heat better than most solid materials, but like a thermosiphon are passively pumped. The Boeing X-51A deals with external heating through the use of a tungsten nosecone and space shuttle-style heat shield tiles on its belly. Internal (engine) heating is absorbed by using the JP-7 fuel as a coolant prior to combustion. Other high temperature materials, referred to as SHARP materials (typically zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride) have been used on steering vanes for ICBM reentry vehicles since the 1970s, and are proposed for use on hypersonic vehicles. They are said to permit Mach 11 flight at altitudes and Mach 7 flight at sea level. These materials are more structurally rugged than the Reinforced Carbon Composite (RCC) used on the space shuttle nose and leading edges, have higher radiative and temperature tolerance properties, and do not suffer from oxidation issues that RCC needs to be protected against with coatings.

===Surface material===
A surface material for waverider and hypersonic (Mach 5 – 10) vehicles developed by scientists at the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics (CAAA) in Beijing was tested during 2023. 

An alternative developed by RTX Corporation uses a perspiring membrane developed under work supported by the United States Air Force under Contract No. United States Air Force FA8650-20-C-7001&quot;

<text>Estradiol (E2), also called oestrogen, oestradiol, is an estrogen steroid hormone and the major female sex hormone. It is involved in the regulation of female reproductive cycles such as estrous and menstrual cycles. Estradiol is responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics such as the breasts, widening of the hips and a female pattern of fat distribution. It is also important in the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues such as the mammary glands, uterus and vagina during puberty, adulthood and pregnancy. It also has important effects in many other tissues including bone, fat, skin, liver, and the brain.

Though estradiol levels in males are much lower than in females, estradiol has important roles in males as well. Apart from humans and other mammals, estradiol is also found in most vertebrates and crustaceans, insects, fish, and other animal species.

Estradiol is produced within the follicles of the ovaries and in other tissues including the testicles, the adrenal glands, fat, liver, the breasts, and the brain. Estradiol is produced in the body from cholesterol through a series of reactions and intermediates. The major pathway involves the formation of androstenedione, which is then converted by aromatase into estrone and is subsequently converted into estradiol. Alternatively, androstenedione can be converted into testosterone, which can then be converted into estradiol. Upon menopause in females, production of estrogens by the ovaries stops and estradiol levels decrease to very low levels.

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, estradiol is used as a medication, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy, and feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women and other genderqueer individuals; for information on estradiol as a medication, see the estradiol (medication) article.

== Biological function ==

=== Sexual development ===
The development of secondary sex characteristics in women is driven by estrogens, to be specific, estradiol. These changes are initiated at the time of puberty, most are enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining estradiol support after menopause. Thus, estradiol produces breast development, and is responsible for changes in the body shape, affecting bones, joints, and fat deposition. In females, estradiol induces breast development, widening of the hips, a feminine fat distribution (with fat deposited particularly in the breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks), and maturation of the vagina and vulva, whereas it mediates the pubertal growth spurt (indirectly via increased growth hormone secretion) and epiphyseal closure (thereby limiting final height) in both sexes.

=== Reproduction ===

==== Female reproductive system ====
In the female, estradiol acts as a growth hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting the lining of the vagina, the cervical glands, the endometrium, and the lining of the fallopian tubes. It enhances growth of the myometrium. Estradiol appears necessary to maintain oocytes in the ovary. During the menstrual cycle, estradiol produced by the growing follicles triggers, via a positive feedback system, the hypothalamic-pituitary events that lead to the luteinizing hormone surge, inducing ovulation. In the luteal phase, estradiol, in conjunction with progesterone, prepares the endometrium for implantation. During pregnancy, estradiol increases due to placental production. The effect of estradiol, together with estrone and estriol, in pregnancy is less clear. They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors. In baboons, blocking of estrogen production leads to pregnancy loss, suggesting estradiol has a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Research is investigating the role of estrogens in the process of initiation of labor. Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.

==== Male reproductive system ====
The effect of estradiol (and estrogens in general) upon male reproduction is complex. Estradiol is produced by action of aromatase mainly in the Leydig cells of the mammalian testis, but also by some germ cells and the Sertoli cells of immature mammals. It functions (&quot;in vitro&quot;) to prevent apoptosis of male sperm cells.
While some studies in the early 1990s claimed a connection between globally declining sperm counts and estrogen exposure in the environment, later studies found no such connection, nor evidence of a general decline in sperm counts.
Suppression of estradiol production in a subpopulation of subfertile men may improve the semen analysis.

Males with certain sex chromosome genetic conditions, such as Klinefelter&#x27;s syndrome, will have a higher level of estradiol.

=== Skeletal system ===
Estradiol has a profound effect on bone. Individuals without it (or other estrogens) will become tall and eunuchoid, as epiphyseal closure is delayed or may not take place. Bone density is also affected, resulting in early osteopenia and osteoporosis. Low levels of estradiol may also predict fractures, with post-menopausal women having the highest incidence of bone fracture. Women past menopause experience an accelerated loss of bone mass due to a relative estrogen deficiency.

=== Skin health ===
The estrogen receptor, as well as the progesterone receptor, have been detected in the skin, including in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. At menopause and thereafter, decreased levels of female sex hormones result in atrophy, thinning, and increased wrinkling of the skin and a reduction in skin elasticity, firmness, and strength. These skin changes constitute an acceleration in skin aging and are the result of decreased collagen content, irregularities in the morphology of epidermal skin cells, decreased ground substance between skin fibers, and reduced capillaries and blood flow. The skin also becomes more dry during menopause, which is due to reduced skin hydration and surface lipids (sebum production). Along with chronological aging and photoaging, estrogen deficiency in menopause is one of the three main factors that predominantly influences skin aging.

Hormone replacement therapy consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of postmenopausal women. These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen has been found to have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and postmenopausal women. Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone. These findings suggest that progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging.

=== Nervous system ===
Estrogens can be produced in the brain from steroid precursors. As antioxidants, they have been found to have neuroprotective function.

The positive and negative feedback loops of the menstrual cycle involve ovarian estradiol as the link to the hypothalamic-pituitary system to regulate gonadotropins.

Estrogen is considered to play a significant role in women&#x27;s mental health, with links suggested between the hormone level, mood and well-being. Sudden drops or fluctuations in, or long periods of sustained low levels of estrogen may be correlated with significant mood-lowering. Clinical recovery from depression postpartum, perimenopause, and postmenopause was shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored.

The volumes of sexually dimorphic brain structures in transgender women were found to change and approximate typical female brain structures when exposed to estrogen concomitantly with androgen deprivation over a period of months, suggesting that estrogen and/or androgens have a significant part to play in sex differentiation of the brain, both prenatally and later in life.

There is also evidence the programming of adult male sexual behavior in many vertebrates is largely dependent on estradiol produced during prenatal life and early infancy. It is not yet known whether this process plays a significant role in human sexual behavior, although evidence from other mammals tends to indicate a connection.

Estrogen has been found to increase the secretion of oxytocin and to increase the expression of its receptor, the oxytocin receptor, in the brain. In women, a single dose of estradiol has been found to be sufficient to increase circulating oxytocin concentrations.

=== Gynecological cancers ===
Estradiol has been tied to the development and progression of cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Estradiol affects target tissues mainly by interacting with two nuclear receptors called estrogen receptor α (ERα) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ). One of the functions of these estrogen receptors is the modulation of gene expression. Once estradiol binds to the ERs, the receptor complexes then bind to specific DNA sequences, possibly causing damage to the DNA and an increase in cell division and DNA replication. Eukaryotic cells respond to damaged DNA by stimulating or impairing G1, S, or G2 phases of the cell cycle to initiate DNA repair. As a result, cellular transformation and cancer cell proliferation occurs.

=== Cardiovascular system ===
Estrogen affects certain blood vessels. Improvement in arterial blood flow has been demonstrated in coronary arteries. 17-beta-estradiol (E2) is considered the most potent estrogen found in humans. E2 influences vascular function, apoptosis, and damage during cardiac ischemia and reperfusion. E2 can protect the heart and individual cardiac myocytes from injuries related to ischemia. After a heart attack or long periods of hypertension, E2 inhibits the adverse effects of pathologic remodeling of the heart.

During pregnancy, high levels of estrogens, namely estradiol, increase coagulation and the risk of venous thromboembolism.

=== Other functions ===
Estradiol has complex effects on the liver. It affects the production of multiple proteins, including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for blood clotting. In high amounts, estradiol can lead to cholestasis, for instance cholestasis of pregnancy.

Certain gynecological conditions are dependent on estrogen, such as endometriosis, leiomyomata uteri, and uterine bleeding.

== Biological activity ==
Estradiol acts primarily as an agonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear steroid hormone receptor. There are two subtypes of the ER, ERα and ERβ, and estradiol potently binds to and activates both of these receptors. The result of ER activation is a modulation of gene transcription and expression in ER-expressing cells, which is the predominant mechanism by which estradiol mediates its biological effects in the body. Estradiol also acts as an agonist of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30), a recently discovered non-nuclear receptor for estradiol, via which it can mediate a variety of rapid, non-genomic effects. Unlike the case of the ER, GPER appears to be selective for estradiol, and shows very low affinities for other endogenous estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Additional mERs besides GPER include ER-X, ERx, and Gq-mER.

ERα/ERβ are in inactive state trapped in multimolecular chaperone complexes organized around the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), containing p23 protein, and immunophilin, and located in majority in cytoplasm and partially in nucleus. In the E2 classical pathway or estrogen classical pathway, estradiol enters the cytoplasm, where it interacts with ERs. Once bound E2, ERs dissociate from the molecular chaperone complexes and become competent to dimerize, migrate to nucleus, and to bind to specific DNA sequences (estrogen response element, ERE), allowing for gene transcription which can take place over hours and days.

Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. As such, estradiol is the main estrogen in the body, although the roles of estrone and estriol as estrogens are said not to be negligible.

== Biochemistry ==
=== Biosynthesis ===
Estradiol, like other steroid hormones, is derived from cholesterol. After side chain cleavage and using the Δ5 or the Δ4- pathway, androstenedione is the key intermediary. A portion of the androstenedione is converted to testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to estradiol by aromatase. In an alternative pathway, androstenedione is aromatized to estrone, which is subsequently converted to estradiol via 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD).

During the reproductive years, most estradiol in women is produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries by the aromatization of androstenedione (produced in the theca folliculi cells) to estrone, followed by conversion of estrone to estradiol by 17β-HSD. Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.

Estradiol is not produced in the gonads only; in particular, fat cells produce active precursors to estradiol, and will continue to do so even after menopause. Estradiol is also produced in the brain and in arterial walls.

In men, approximately 15 to 25% of circulating estradiol is produced in the testicles. The rest is synthesized via peripheral aromatization of testosterone into estradiol and of androstenedione into estrone (which is then transformed into estradiol via peripheral 17β-HSD). This peripheral aromatization occurs predominantly in adipose tissue, but also occurs in other tissues such as bone, liver, and the brain. Approximately 40 to 50 μg of estradiol is produced per day in men.

=== Distribution ===
In plasma, estradiol is largely bound to SHBG and albumin. Only about 2.21% (± 0.04%) of estradiol is free and biologically active. The percentage remains constant throughout the menstrual cycle.

=== Metabolism ===

Inactivation of estradiol includes conversion to less-active estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Estriol is the major urinary metabolite. Estradiol is conjugated in the liver to form estrogen conjugates like estradiol sulfate, estradiol glucuronide and, as such, excreted via the kidneys. Some of the water-soluble conjugates are excreted via the bile duct, and partly reabsorbed after hydrolysis from the intestinal tract. This enterohepatic circulation contributes to maintaining estradiol levels.

Estradiol is also metabolized via hydroxylation into catechol estrogens. In the liver, it is non-specifically metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 via 2-hydroxylation into 2-hydroxyestradiol, and by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8 via 17β-hydroxy dehydrogenation into estrone, with various other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and metabolic transformations also being involved.

Estradiol is additionally conjugated with an ester into lipoidal estradiol forms like estradiol palmitate and estradiol stearate to a certain extent; these esters are stored in adipose tissue and may act as a very long-lasting reservoir of estradiol.

=== Excretion ===
Estradiol is excreted in the form of glucuronide and sulfate estrogen conjugates in urine. Following an intravenous injection of labeled estradiol in women, almost 90% is excreted in urine and feces within 4 to 5 days. Enterohepatic recirculation causes a delay in excretion of estradiol.

=== Levels ===
Levels of estradiol in premenopausal women are highly variable throughout the menstrual cycle and reference ranges widely vary from source to source. Estradiol levels are minimal and according to most laboratories range from 20 to 80 pg/mL during the early to mid follicular phase (or the first week of the menstrual cycle, also known as menses). Levels of estradiol gradually increase during this time and through the mid to late follicular phase (or the second week of the menstrual cycle) until the pre-ovulatory phase. At the time of pre-ovulation (a period of about 24 to 48 hours), estradiol levels briefly surge and reach their highest concentrations of any other time during the menstrual cycle. Circulating levels are typically between 130 and 200 pg/mL at this time, but in some women may be as high as 300 to 400 pg/mL, and the upper limit of the reference range of some laboratories are even greater (for instance, 750 pg/mL). Following ovulation (or mid-cycle) and during the latter half of the menstrual cycle or the luteal phase, estradiol levels plateau and fluctuate between around 100 and 150 pg/mL during the early and mid luteal phase, and at the time of the late luteal phase, or a few days before menstruation, reach a low of around 40 pg/mL. The mean integrated levels of estradiol during a full menstrual cycle have variously been reported by different sources as 80, 120, and 150 pg/mL. Although contradictory reports exist, one study found mean integrated estradiol levels of 150 pg/mL in younger women whereas mean integrated levels ranged from 50 to 120 pg/mL in older women.

During the reproductive years of human females, levels of estradiol are somewhat higher than that of estrone, except during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, estradiol may be considered the predominant estrogen during human female reproductive years in terms of absolute serum levels and estrogenic activity. During pregnancy, estriol becomes the predominant circulating estrogen, and this is the only time at which estetrol occurs in the body, while during menopause, estrone predominates (both based on serum levels). The estradiol produced by male humans, from testosterone, is present at serum levels roughly comparable to those of postmenopausal women (14–55 versus &lt;35 pg/mL, respectively). It has also been reported that if concentrations of estradiol in a 70-year-old man are compared to those of a 70-year-old woman, levels are approximately 2- to 4-fold higher in the man.

==== Measurement ====
In women, serum estradiol is measured in a clinical laboratory and reflects primarily the activity of the ovaries. The Estradiol blood test measures the amount of estradiol in the blood. It is used to check the function of the ovaries, placenta, adrenal glands. This can detect baseline estrogen in women with amenorrhea or menstrual dysfunction, and to detect the state of hypoestrogenicity and menopause. Furthermore, estrogen monitoring during fertility therapy assesses follicular growth and is useful in monitoring the treatment. Estrogen-producing tumors will demonstrate persistent high levels of estradiol and other estrogens. In precocious puberty, estradiol levels are inappropriately increased.

==== Ranges ====
Individual laboratory results should always be interpreted using the ranges provided by the laboratory that performed the test.


In the normal menstrual cycle, estradiol levels measure typically &lt;50 pg/mL at menstruation, rise with follicular development (peak: 200 pg/mL), drop briefly at ovulation, and rise again during the luteal phase for a second peak. At the end of the luteal phase, estradiol levels drop to their menstrual levels unless there is a pregnancy.

During pregnancy, estrogen levels, including estradiol, rise steadily toward term. The source of these estrogens is the placenta, which aromatizes prohormones produced in the fetal adrenal gland.

== Medical use ==
Estradiol is used as a medication, primarily in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms as well as feminizing hormone therapy for trans individuals.

== Chemistry ==

Estradiol is an estrane steroid. It is also known as 17β-estradiol (to distinguish it from 17α-estradiol) or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol. It has two hydroxyl groups, one at the C3 position and the other at the 17β position, as well as three double bonds in the A ring. Due to its two hydroxyl groups, estradiol is often abbreviated as E2. The structurally related estrogens, estrone (E1), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4) have one, three, and four hydroxyl groups, respectively.

== Neuropsychopharmacology ==
Product insert information, accompanying commercial perscription estradiol, indicates it causes depression.
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, estradiol was shown to have gender-specific effects on fairness sensitivity. Overall, when the division of a given amount of money was framed as either fair or unfair in a modified version of the ultimatum game, estradiol increased the acceptance rate of fair-framed proposals among men and decreased it among women. However, among the placebo-group &quot;the mere belief of receiving estradiol treatment significantly increased the acceptance of unfair-framed offers in both sexes&quot;, indicating that so-called &quot;environmental&quot; factors played a role in organising the responses towards these presentations of the ultimatum game.

== History ==
The discovery of estrogen is usually credited to the American scientists Edgar Allen and Edward A. Doisy. In 1923, they observed that injection of fluid from porcine ovarian follicles produced pubertal- and estrus-type changes (including vaginal, uterine, and mammary gland changes and sexual receptivity) in sexually immature, ovariectomized mice and rats. These findings demonstrated the existence of a hormone which is produced by the ovaries and is involved in sexual maturation and reproduction. At the time of its discovery, Allen and Doisy did not name the hormone, and simply referred to it as an &quot;ovarian hormone&quot; or &quot;follicular hormone&quot;; others referred to it variously as &quot;feminin&quot;, &quot;folliculin&quot;, &quot;menformon&quot;, &quot;thelykinin&quot;, and &quot;emmenin&quot;. In 1926, Parkes and Bellerby coined the term &quot;estrin&quot; to describe the hormone on the basis of it inducing estrus in animals. Estrone was isolated and purified independently by Allen and Doisy and German scientist Adolf Butenandt in 1929, and estriol was isolated and purified by Marrian in 1930; they were the first estrogens to be identified.

Estradiol, the most potent of the three major estrogens, was the last of the three to be identified. It was discovered by Schwenk and Hildebrant in 1933, who synthesized it via reduction of estrone. Estradiol was subsequently isolated and purified from sow ovaries by Doisy in 1935, with its chemical structure determined simultaneously, and was referred to variously as &quot;dihydrotheelin&quot;, &quot;dihydrofolliculin&quot;, &quot;dihydrofollicular hormone&quot;, and &quot;dihydroxyestrin&quot;. In 1935, the name &quot;estradiol&quot; and the term &quot;estrogen&quot; were formally established by the Sex Hormone Committee of the Health Organization of the League of Nations; this followed the names estrone (which was initially called theelin, progynon, folliculin, and ketohydroxyestrin) and estriol (initially called theelol and trihydroxyestrin) having been established in 1932 at the first meeting of the International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones in London. Following its discovery, a partial synthesis of estradiol from cholesterol was developed by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1940, and a total synthesis was developed by Anner and Miescher in 1948.

== Society and culture ==

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;estradiol&quot; derives from &#x27;, Gk. &#x27; (, literally meaning &quot;verve or inspiration&quot;), which refers to the estrane steroid ring system, and &quot;&quot;, a chemical term and suffix indicating that the compound is a type of alcohol bearing two hydroxyl groups.

<doc id="227091" wikidata="Q170156" url="?curid=227091" title="Confederation">
<text>A confederation (also known as a confederacy or league) is a political union of sovereign states united for purposes of common action. Usually created by a treaty, confederations of states tend to be established for dealing with critical issues, such as defence, foreign relations, internal trade or currency, with the central government being required to provide support for all its members. Confederalism represents a main form of intergovernmentalism, defined as any form of interaction around states that takes place on the basis of sovereign independence or government.

The nature of the relationship among the member states constituting a confederation varies considerably. Likewise, the relationship between the member states and the general government and their distribution of powers varies. Some looser confederations are similar to international organisations. Other confederations with stricter rules may resemble federal systems.
These elements of such confederations, the international organization and federalist perspective, has been combined as supranational unions.

Since the member states of a confederation retain their sovereignty, they have an implicit right of secession. The political philosopher Emmerich de Vattel said: &quot;Several sovereign and independent states may unite themselves together by a perpetual confederacy without each, in particular, ceasing to be a perfect state... The deliberations in common will offer no violence to the sovereignty of each member&quot;.

Under a confederation, compared to a federal state, the central authority is relatively weak. Decisions made by the general government in a unicameral legislature, a council of the member states, require subsequent implementation by the member states to take effect; they are not laws acting directly upon the individual but have more the character of interstate agreements. Also, decision-making in the general government usually proceeds by consensus (unanimity), not by the majority. Historically, those features limit the union&#x27;s effectiveness. Hence, political pressure tends to build over time for the transition to a federal system of government, as in the American, Swiss and German cases of regional integration.

==Confederated states==
In terms of internal structure, every confederal state is composed of two or more constituent states, referred to as &quot;confederated states&quot;. Regarding their political systems, confederated states can have republican or monarchical forms of government. Those that have a republican form (confederated republics) are usually called &quot;states&quot; (like states of the American Confederacy, 1861–1865) or &quot;republics&quot; (like republics of Serbia and Montenegro within the former State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, 2003–2006). Those that have a monarchical form of government (confederated monarchies) are defined by various hierarchical ranks (like kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan within the Hashemite Arab Union in 1958).

==Examples==
===Belgium===
Many scholars have claimed that the Kingdom of Belgium, a country with a complicated federal structure has adopted some characteristics of a confederation under the pressure of separatist movements, especially in Flanders. For example, C. E. Lagasse declared that Belgium was &quot;near the political system of a Confederation&quot; regarding the constitutional reform agreements between Belgian &quot;Regions&quot; and between &quot;Communities&quot;, and the director of the &quot;Centre de recherche et d&#x27;information socio-politiques&quot; (CRISP) Vincent de Coorebyter called Belgium &quot;undoubtedly a federation...[with] some aspects of a confederation&quot; in &quot;Le Soir&quot;. Also in &quot;Le Soir&quot;, Michel Quévit of the Catholic University of Louvain wrote that the &quot;Belgian political system is already in dynamics of a Confederation&quot;.

Nevertheless, the Belgian regions and the linguistic communities do not have the autonomy to leave the Belgian state. As such, federal aspects still dominate. Also, for fiscal policy and public finances, the federal state dominates the other levels of government.

The increasingly-confederal aspects of the Belgian Federal State appear to be a political reflection of the profound cultural, sociological and economic differences between the &quot;Flemish&quot; (Belgians who speak Dutch or Dutch dialects) and the &quot;Walloons&quot; (Belgians who speak French or French dialects). For example, in the last several decades, over 95% of Belgians have voted for political parties that represent voters from only one community, the separatist N-VA being the party with the most voter support among the Flemish population. Parties that strongly advocate Belgian unity and appeal to voters of both communities usually play only a marginal role in nationwide general elections. The system in Belgium is known as consociationalism.

That makes Belgium fundamentally different from federal countries like Switzerland, Canada, Germany and Australia. National parties receive over 90% of voter support in those countries. The only geographical areas comparable with Belgium within Europe are Catalonia, the Basque Country (both part of Spain), Northern Ireland and Scotland (both part of the United Kingdom) and parts of Italy, where a massive voter turnout for regional (and often separatist) political parties has become the rule in the last decades, and nationwide parties advocating national unity draw around half or sometimes less of the votes.

===Benelux===
The Benelux is a politico-economic union of the states of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg bound through treaties and based on consensus between the representatives of the member states.

They partially share a common foreign policy, especially in regards to their navies through the BeNeSam. The Dutch defence minister (2010–2012) Hans Hillen even said on Belgian radio that it is not impossible that the three armed forces of the member-states could be integrated into &quot;Benelux Armed Forces&quot; one day.

Because of this the Benelux is sometimes labeled as a &quot;kind of confederation&quot; by, for example, Belgian Minister of State Mark Eyskens.

===Canada===

Canada is an unusually decentralized federal state, not a confederate association of sovereign states, the usual meaning of &quot;confederation&quot; in modern terms. In Canada, the word &quot;confederation&quot; has an additional unrelated meaning. &quot;Confederation&quot; refers to the process of (or the event of) establishing or joining the Canadian federal state. 

In modern terminology, Canada is a federation, not a confederation. However, to contemporaries of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, &quot;confederation&quot; did not have the same connotation of a weakly-centralized federation. Canadian Confederation generally refers to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, which formed the Dominion of Canada from three of the colonies of British North America, and to the subsequent incorporation of other colonies and territories. Beginning on 1 July 1867, it was initially a self-governing dominion of the British Empire with a federal structure, whose government was led by Sir John A. Macdonald. The initial colonies involved were the Province of Canada (becoming Quebec from Canada East, formerly the colony of Lower Canada; and Ontario from Canada West, formerly the colony of Upper Canada), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Later participants were Manitoba, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Alberta and Saskatchewan (the latter two created in 1905 as federated provinces from parts of the directly federally administered Northwest Territories, first transferred to the Dominion in 1869 and now possessing devolved governments as itself, Yukon and Nunavut), and finally Newfoundland (now Newfoundland and Labrador) in 1949. A Canadian judicial constitutional interpretation, &quot;Reference Re Secession of Quebec&quot;, and a subsequent federal law, set forth negotiating conditions for a Canadian province (though not a territory) to leave the Canadian federal state (addressed also by a related Quebec law). Importantly, negotiation would first need triggering by referendum and executing by constitutional amendment using a current amending mechanism of Canada&#x27;s constitution—meaning that, while not legal under the current constitution, it is democratically feasible without resorting to extralegal means or international involvement.

===European Union===
Its unique nature and the political sensitivities surrounding it cause there to be no common or legal classification for the European Union (EU). However, it bears some resemblance to both a confederation (or a &quot;new&quot; type of confederation) and a federation. The term supranational union has also been applied. The EU operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws, which enable a single economic market, a common customs territory, (mainly) open internal borders, and a common currency among most member-states. However, unlike a federation, the EU does not have exclusive powers over foreign affairs, defence, taxation, along with the immigration and transit of non-EU nationals. Furthermore, most EU laws, which have been developed by consensus between relevant national government ministers and then scrutinised and approved or rejected by the European Parliament, must be transposed into national law by national parliaments. Most collective decisions by member states are taken by weighted majorities and blocking minorities typical of upper houses in federations. On the other hand, the absolute unanimity typical of intergovernmentalism is required only in respect to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, as well as in situations when ratification of a treaty or of a treaty amendment is required. Such a form may thus be described as a semi-intergovernmental confederation.

However, some academic observers more usually discuss the EU in the terms of it being a federation. As the international law professor Joseph H. H. Weiler (of the Hague Academy and New York University) wrote, &quot;Europe has charted its own brand of constitutional federalism&quot;. Jean-Michel Josselin and Alain Marciano see the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg City as being a primary force behind the building of a federal legal order for the EU, with Josselin stating that a &quot;complete shift from a confederation to a federation would have required to straight-forwardly replace the principality of the member states vis-à-vis the Union by that of the European citizens. As a consequence, both confederate and federate features coexist in the judicial landscape&quot;. Rutgers political science professor R. Daniel Kelemen said: &quot;Those uncomfortable using the &#x27;F&#x27; word in the EU context should feel free to refer to it as a quasi-federal or federal-like system. Nevertheless, the EU has the necessary attributes of a federal system. It is striking that while many scholars of the EU continue to resist analyzing it as a federation, most contemporary students of federalism view the EU as a federal system&quot;. Thomas Risse and Tanja A. Börzel claim that the &quot;EU only lacks two significant features of a federation. First, the Member States remain the &quot;masters&quot; of the treaties, i.e., they have the exclusive power to amend or change the constitutive treaties of the EU. Second, the EU lacks a real &quot;tax and spend&quot; capacity, in other words, there is no fiscal federalism&quot;.

Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, the chairman of the body of experts commissioned to elaborate a constitutional charter for the European Union, was confronted with strong opposition from the United Kingdom towards including the words &quot;federal&quot; or &quot;federation&quot; in the unratified European Constitution and the word was replaced with either &quot;Community&quot; or &quot;Union&quot;.

A majority of the Political Groups in the European Parliament, including the EPP, the S&amp;D Group and Renew Europe, support a federal model for the European Union. The ECR Group argues for a reformed European Union along confederal lines. The Brothers of Italy party, led by Giorgia Meloni, campaigns for a confederal Europe. On her election as President of the ECR Party in September 2020 Meloni said, &quot;Let us continue to fight together for a confederate Europe of free and sovereign states&quot;.

===Indigenous confederations in North America===

In the context of the history of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, a confederacy may refer to a semi-permanent political and military alliance consisting of multiple nations (or &quot;tribes&quot;, &quot;bands&quot;, or &quot;villages&quot;), which maintained their separate leadership. One of the most well-known is the Haudenosaunee (or Iroquois), but there were many others during different eras and locations across North America, such as the Wabanaki Confederacy, Western Confederacy, Tsenacommacah, Seven Nations of Canada, Pontiac&#x27;s Confederacy, Pennacook Confederacy, Illinois Confederation, Tecumseh&#x27;s Confederacy, Muscogee Confederacy, Great Sioux Nation, Blackfoot Confederacy, Warm Springs Confederacy, Manahoac Confederacy, Iron Confederacy and Council of Three Fires.

The Haudenosaunee Confederacy, historically known as the Iroquois League or the League of Five (later Six) Nations, is the country of Native Americans (in what is now the United States) and First Nations (in what is now Canada) that consists of six nations: the Mohawk, the Oneida, the Onondaga, the Cayuga, the Seneca and the Tuscarora. The Six Nations have a representative government known as the Grand Council which is the oldest governmental institution still maintaining its original form in North America. Each clan from the five nations sends chiefs to act as representatives and make decisions for the whole confederation. It has been operating since its foundation in 1142 despite limited international recognition today.

=== Indigenous confederations in South America ===
Several of the Pre-Columbian cultures of Colombia, such as the Muisca and Tairona were composed of loose confederations. The Muisca form of government consisted of two different rulers that governed a region in the central Andean highlands in present-day Colombia. The &quot;Hoa&quot; ruled the northern section of the confederation, while the &quot;Zipa&quot; ruled the southern portion.

The Andean civilizations consisted of loose confederations, such as the Aymara kingdoms and the Diaguita, with the former being composed of distinct diarchies.

===Serbia and Montenegro===
In 2003, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was transformed into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, a confederation of the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia. The state was constituted as a loose political union, but formally functioned as a sovereign subject of international law, and member of the United Nations. As a confederation, the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro had very few shared functions, such as defense, foreign affairs and a weak common president, ministerial council and parliament.

The two constituent republics functioned separately throughout the period of its short existence, and they continued to operate under separate economic policies and to use separate currencies (the euro was and still is the only legal tender in Montenegro, and the dinar was and still is the legal tender in Serbia). On 21 May 2006, the Montenegrin independence referendum was held. The final official results indicated on 31 May that 55.5% of voters voted in favor of independence. The confederation effectively came to an end after Montenegro&#x27;s formal declaration of independence on 3 June 2006 and Serbia&#x27;s formal declaration of independence on 5 June.

===Switzerland===

Switzerland, officially known as the &quot;Swiss Confederation&quot;, is an example of a modern country that traditionally refers to itself as a confederation because the official (and traditional) name of Switzerland in German (the majority language of the Swiss) is &#x27; (literally &quot;Swiss Comradeship by Oath&quot;), an expression which was translated into the Latin &#x27; (Helvetic Confederation). It had been a confederacy since its inception in 1291 as the Old Swiss Confederacy, which was originally created as an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps, until it became a federation in 1848 but it retains the name of Confederacy for reasons of historical tradition. The confederacy facilitated management of common interests (such as freedom from external domination especially from the Habsburg Empire, the development of republican institutions in a Europe dominated by monarchies and free trade), and it ensured peace between the different cultural entities of the area.

After the Sonderbund War of 1847, when some of the Catholic cantons of Switzerland attempted to set up a separate union (&quot;&quot; in German) against the Protestant majority, a vote was held and the majority of the cantons approved the new Federal Constitution which changed the political system to one of a federation.

=== Union State of Russia and Belarus===
In 1999, Russia and Belarus signed a treaty to form a confederation, which came into force on 26 January 2000. Although it was given the name &quot;Union State&quot;, and has some characteristics of a federation, it remains a confederation of two sovereign states. Its existence has been seen as an indication of Russia&#x27;s political and economic support for the Belarusian government. The confederation was created with the objective of co-ordinating common action on economic integration and foreign affairs. However, many of the treaty&#x27;s provisions have not yet been implemented. Consequently, &quot;The Times&quot;, in 2020, described it as &quot;a mostly unimplemented confederation&quot;.
=== Confederation of Sahel States ===
On July 6, 2024, at the end of the first summit of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), the final communiqué announced the creation of a confederation of the three countries of the AES, namely Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. it was in February 2024 that the military powers of the three countries announced the creation of the AES after their withdrawal from ECOWAS.

== Historical confederations ==

Historical confederations (especially those predating the 20th century) may not fit the current definition of a confederation, may be proclaimed as a federation but be confederal (or the reverse), and may not show any qualities that 21st-century political scientists might classify as those of a confederation.

===List===
Some have more the characteristics of a personal union, but appear here because of their self-styling as a &quot;confederation&quot;:

<doc id="227097" wikidata="Q1965644" url="?curid=227097" title="String Quartet No. 8 (Shostakovich)">
<text>Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s String Quartet No. 8 in [[C minor]], Op. 110, was written in three days (12–14 July 1960).

==Composition and performances==
The piece was written shortly after Shostakovich reluctantly joined the Communist Party. According to the score, it is dedicated &quot;to the victims of fascism and the war&quot;; his son Maxim interprets this as a reference to the victims of all totalitarianism, while his daughter Galina says that he dedicated it to himself, and that the published dedication was imposed by Soviet authorities. Shostakovich&#x27;s friend, Lev Lebedinsky, said that Shostakovich thought of the work as his epitaph and that he planned to commit suicide around this time. Peter J. Rabinowitz has also pointed to covert references to Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosen&quot; in the Eighth Quartet.

The work was written in Dresden, where Shostakovich was to write music for the film &quot;Five Days, Five Nights&quot;, a joint project by Soviet and East German filmmakers about the bombing of Dresden in World War II.

The quartet was premiered in 1960 in Leningrad by the Beethoven Quartet. In the liner notes of the Borodin Quartet&#x27;s 1962 recording, music critic Erik Smith writes, &quot;The Borodin Quartet played this work to the composer at his Moscow home, hoping for his criticisms. But Shostakovich, overwhelmed by this beautiful realisation of his most personal feelings, buried his head in his hands and wept. When they had finished playing, the four musicians quietly packed up their instruments and stole out of the room.&quot;

==Music==
The quartet is in five interconnected movements and lasts about 20 minutes:

The first movement opens with the DSCH motif, Shostakovich&#x27;s musical signature. This theme can also be heard in his Cello Concerto No. 1, Symphony No. 10, Violin Concerto No. 1, Symphony No. 15, and Piano Sonata No. 2. The motif is used in every movement of this quartet, and is the basis of the faster theme of the third movement.

The work is filled with quotations of other pieces by Shostakovich: the first movement quotes his Symphony No. 1 and Symphony No. 5; the second movement uses a Jewish theme first used by Shostakovich in his Piano Trio No. 2; the third movement quotes the Cello Concerto No. 1; and the fourth movement quotes the 19th century revolutionary song &quot;Tormented by Grievous Bondage&quot; ( , by Grigori Machtet) and the aria &quot;Seryozha, my love&quot; from Shostakovich&#x27;s opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot;. The fifth contains a play upon another motif from &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot;.

Rudolf Barshai transcribed the quartet for string orchestra, in which version it is known as Chamber Symphony in C minor, Op. 110a. Boris Giltburg arranged the quartet for piano solo. Other arrangements include Lucas Drew&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia&quot; for string orchestra and Abram Stasevich&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; for string orchestra and timpani.

==In literature==
This quartet is heavily referenced in William T. Vollmann&#x27;s novel &quot;Europe Central&quot;, and a central part of that novel discusses its writing and the composer&#x27;s life under the Soviet system.

==In film==
The fourth movement of the quartet is used extensively in &quot;The Lobster&quot;, a 2015 film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.

<text>Retro style is imitative or consciously derivative of lifestyles, trends, or art forms from the past, including in music, modes, fashions, or attitudes. It has been argued that there is a nostalgia cycle in popular culture.

==Definition==
The term &quot;retro&quot; has been in use since 1972 to describe on the one hand, new artifacts that self-consciously refer to particular modes, motifs, techniques, and materials of the past. But on the other hand, many people use the term to categorize styles that have been created in the past. Retro style refers to new things that display characteristics of the past. Unlike the historicism of the Romantic generations, it is mostly the recent past that retro seeks to recapitulate, focusing on the products, fashions, and artistic styles produced since the Industrial Revolution, the successive styles of Modernity. The English word &quot;retro&quot; derives from the Latin prefix &quot;retro&quot;, meaning backwards, or in past times.

In France, the word &quot;rétro&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;rétrospectif&quot;, gained cultural currency with reevaluations of Charles de Gaulle and France&#x27;s role in World War II. The French &quot;mode rétro&quot; of the 1970s reappraised in film and novels the conduct of French civilians during the Nazi occupation. The term &quot;rétro&quot; was soon applied to nostalgic French fashions that recalled the same period.

Shortly thereafter &quot;retro&quot; was introduced into English by the fashion and culture press, where it suggests a rather cynical revival of older but relatively recent fashions. In &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;, French theorist Jean Baudrillard describes &quot;retro&quot; as a demythologization of the past, distancing the present from the big ideas that drove the modern age.

Most commonly &quot;retro&quot; is used to describe objects and attitudes from the recent past that never seem modern. It suggests a fundamental shift in the way we relate to the past. Different from more traditional forms of revivalism, &quot;retro&quot; suggests a half ironic, half longing consideration of the recent past; it has been called an &quot;unsentimental nostalgia&quot;, recalling modern forms that are no longer current. The concept of nostalgia is linked to retro, but the bittersweet desire for things, persons, and situations of the past has an ironic stance in retro style. Retro shows nostalgia with a dose of cynicism and detachment. The desire to capture something from the past and evoke nostalgia is fuelled by dissatisfaction with the present.

== Types ==


Since the 1980s the implications of the word &quot;retro&quot; have been expanding in the application to different mediums. Several fields have adopted the term from the design field.

=== Objects ===
Until the 1960s, interiors were often decorated with antiques. During the 1960s in London, shops started selling pieces of second-hand furniture. These shops differed from the previous antique shops because they sold daily life objects from the recent past. These objects used to be seen as junk: Victorian enamel signs, stuffed bears, old furniture painted with union jacks, bowler hats etc. A new way of producing and consuming the past emerged and a broader range of objects from the recent past was used for new designs.

Before the word &quot;retro&quot; came into use in the 1970s, the practice of adopting old styles for new designs was already common. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, designers borrowed from the past, for example, classicistic style. The difference is that since the 1960s, people started to refer to the recent past.

In the 1980s, design history emerged as a discipline and several histories of design were published. The access to these overviews and the ability to experiment with computer design programs has caused an increase of retro designed objects in the last decades.

=== Interior design ===

Interior design magazines often show retro style as an interior decoration of mixed styles and objects from the past, second hand and new. For example, 1970s patterned wallpapers, combined with second-hand furniture also from the 1970s, the 1960s, or 1950s. The value of old artifacts has increased, because the objects used to be considered old-fashioned and every day. In this case &#x27;retro&#x27; indicates a value, which is also partly why today&#x27;s retailers produce new objects in an old style.

=== Graphic design, typography, and packaging ===
Long before the use of the word &quot;retro&quot;, graphic design made reference to earlier graphic characteristics. William Morris can be seen as an example: for book design and other purposes he adopted Medieval production and stylistic models in 1891. Furthermore, in the beginning of the twentieth century, Gothic, Baroque and Rococo motifs were used for new products.

In typography, classicism has always been an influence and throughout the 20th century, and in early woodcut printing as well. The introduction of the technique of photocomposition in the 1960s allowed typographers greater flexibility in the selection and arrangement of type styles and sizes. For example, psychedelic typefaces were developed, gaining inspiration from Art Nouveau and other cultures. Historicist styles are also used in the promotion and packaging of food and household products, referring to childhood memories and domestic nostalgic ideals.

In logo designing, retro logos have been highlighted. Brands have incorporated retro logo designs to highlight their brand&#x27;s voice and message: clean, classic, and reminiscent of the recent past.

===Fashion design===
In the 2000s and 2010s, there was a revival of pastel and neon colors, stereotypically associated with 1980s and early 1990s fashion (with the 1980s pastel revival being a rebirth of a 1950s trend). Also at this time, late 1980s-style high-waisted mom jeans made a comeback with female hipsters. In the 2010s and 2020s, 1990s fashion has made a comeback: many of the fabrics and patterns ubiquitous in that decade (such as crushed velvet and floral) are popular now, and Dr. Martens, a shoe brand popular in the 1990s, also made a strong comeback in the early 2010s, as 2011–12 was the British company&#x27;s best-selling season of all time.

===Retro art===

The style now called retro art is a genre of pop art which was developed from the 1940s to 1960s, in response to a need for bold, eye-catching graphics that were easy to reproduce on simple presses available at the time in major centres. Retro advertising art has experienced a resurgence in popularity since its style is distinctive from modern computer-generated styling. Contemporary artist Anne Taintor uses retro advertising art as the centerpiece for her ongoing commentary on the modern woman. Specific styling features include analog machine design and vintage television programs.

A famous example of a retro pop-art character is the more generalized form of the Ward Cleaver-styled J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs-esque icon which has been widely played off, copied, and parodied.

=== Media and culture ===
==== Film, music, fashion, and television ====
Foreshadowed by the Mothers of Invention album Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets in 1968, and the revival and parody group Sha Na Na in 1969, the 1970s and 1980s brought about a 1950s–early 1960s revival with films and television shows such as &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; set in this time period.

==== Retro gaming ====

Retro gaming is a pastime which is becoming increasingly popular where individuals play video games on vintage computers or a classic game consoles. What constitutes a vintage or retro machine is sometimes open to debate, but typically, most retro gamers are interested in Commodore 64, Amiga 500, Atari 2600, Famicom/NES, Mega Drive/Sega Genesis, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, Super Famicom/Super NES, and classic Game Boy games and consoles. Emulation often plays a part in retro gaming if the original hardware is unavailable.

=== Aircraft ===

A handful of airlines have chosen to paint a historical livery on a single selected aircraft in their modern fleet, typically as a marketing device or to commemorate an anniversary.

===By country and era===
In Japan, Showa retro is retro related to the Showa era.

<doc id="227100" wikidata="Q207442" url="?curid=227100" title="Silver nitrate">
<text>Silver nitrate is an inorganic compound with chemical formula . It is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds, such as those used in photography. It is far less sensitive to light than the halides. It was once called &quot;lunar caustic&quot; because silver was called &quot;luna&quot; by ancient alchemists who associated silver with the moon. In solid silver nitrate, the silver ions are three-coordinated in a trigonal planar arrangement.

==Synthesis and structure==
Albertus Magnus, in the 13th century, documented the ability of nitric acid to separate gold and silver by dissolving the silver. Indeed silver nitrate can be prepared by dissolving silver in nitric acid followed by evaporation of the solution. The stoichiometry of the reaction depends upon the concentration of nitric acid used.
:3 Ag + 4 HNO3 (cold and diluted) → 3 AgNO3 + 2 H2O + NO
:Ag + 2 HNO3 (hot and concentrated) → AgNO3 + H2O + NO2

The structure of silver nitrate has been examined by X-ray crystallography several times. In the common orthorhombic form stable at ordinary temperature and pressure, the silver atoms form pairs with Ag---Ag contacts of 3.227 Å. Each Ag+ center is bonded to six oxygen centers of both uni- and bidentate nitrate ligands. The Ag-O distances range from 2.384 to 2.702 Å.

==Reactions==
A typical reaction with silver nitrate is to suspend a rod of copper in a solution of silver nitrate and leave it for a few hours. The silver nitrate reacts with copper to form hairlike crystals of silver metal and a blue solution of copper nitrate:
: 2 AgNO3 + Cu → Cu(NO3)2 + 2 Ag

Silver nitrate decomposes when heated:
: 2 AgNO3(l) → 2 Ag(s) + O2(g) + 2 NO2(g)

Qualitatively, decomposition is negligible below the melting point, but becomes appreciable around 250 °C and fully decomposes at 440 °C.

Most metal nitrates thermally decompose to the respective oxides, but silver oxide decomposes at a lower temperature than silver nitrate, so the decomposition of silver nitrate yields elemental silver instead.

==Uses==

===Precursor to other silver compounds===
Silver nitrate is the least expensive salt of silver; it offers several other advantages as well. It is non-hygroscopic, in contrast to silver fluoroborate and silver perchlorate. In addition, it is relatively stable to light, and it dissolves in numerous solvents, including water. The nitrate can be easily replaced by other ligands, rendering AgNO3 versatile. Treatment with solutions of halide ions gives a precipitate of AgX (X = Cl, Br, I). When making photographic film, silver nitrate is treated with halide salts of sodium or potassium to form insoluble silver halide in situ in photographic gelatin, which is then applied to strips of tri-acetate or polyester. Similarly, silver nitrate is used to prepare some silver-based explosives, such as the fulminate, azide, or acetylide, through a precipitation reaction.

Treatment of silver nitrate with base gives dark grey silver oxide:
:2 AgNO3 + 2 NaOH → Ag2O + 2 NaNO3 + H2O

===Halide abstraction===
The silver cation, , reacts quickly with halide sources to produce the insoluble silver halide, which is a cream precipitate if is used, a white precipitate if is used and a yellow precipitate if is used. This reaction is commonly used in inorganic chemistry to abstract halides:

:(aq) + (aq) → AgX(s)

where = , , or .

Other silver salts with non-coordinating anions, namely silver tetrafluoroborate and silver hexafluorophosphate are used for more demanding applications.

Similarly, this reaction is used in analytical chemistry to confirm the presence of chloride, bromide, or iodide ions. Samples are typically acidified with dilute nitric acid to remove interfering ions, e.g. carbonate ions and sulfide ions. This step avoids confusion of silver sulfide or silver carbonate precipitates with that of silver halides. The color of precipitate varies with the halide: white (silver chloride), pale yellow/cream (silver bromide), yellow (silver iodide). AgBr and especially AgI photo-decompose to the metal, as evidenced by a grayish color on exposed samples.

The same reaction was used on steamships in order to determine whether or not boiler feedwater had been contaminated with seawater. It is still used to determine if moisture on formerly dry cargo is a result of condensation from humid air, or from seawater leaking through the hull.

===Organic synthesis===
Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene. Silver nitrate is highly soluble in water but is poorly soluble in most organic solvents, except acetonitrile (111.8 g/100 g, 25 °C).

===Biology===
In histology, silver nitrate is used for silver staining, for demonstrating reticular fibers, proteins and nucleic acids. For this reason it is also used to demonstrate proteins in PAGE gels. It can be used as a stain in scanning electron microscopy.

Cut flower stems can be placed in a silver nitrate solution, which prevents the production of ethylene. This delays ageing of the flower.

=== Indelible ink ===
Silver nitrate produces long-lasting stain when applied to skin and is one of indelible ink’s ingredients. An electoral stain makes use of this to mark a finger of people who have voted in an election, allowing easy identification to prevent double-voting.
In addition to staining skin, silver nitrate has a history of use in stained glass. In the 14th century, artists began using a &quot;silver stain&quot; (also known as a yellow stain) made from silver nitrate to create a yellow effect on clear glass. The stain would produce a stable color that could range from pale lemon to deep orange or gold. Silver stain was often used with glass paint, and was applied to the opposite side of the glass as the paint. It was also used to create a mosaic effect by reducing the number of pieces of glass in a window. Despite the age of the technique, this process of creating stained glass remains almost entirely unchanged.

==Medicine==
Silver salts have antiseptic properties. In 1881 Credé introduced a method known as Credé&#x27;s prophylaxis, which used of dilute (2%) solutions of silver nitrate in newborn babies&#x27; eyes at birth to prevent contraction of gonorrhea from the mother, which could cause blindness via ophthalmia neonatorum. (Modern antibiotics are now used instead). 

Fused silver nitrate, shaped into sticks, was traditionally called &quot;lunar caustic&quot;. It is used as a cauterizing agent, for example to remove granulation tissue around a stoma. General Sir James Abbott noted in his journals that in India in 1827 it was infused by a British surgeon into wounds in his arm resulting from the bite of a mad dog to cauterize the wounds and prevent the onset of rabies.

Silver nitrate is used to cauterize superficial blood vessels in the nose to help prevent nosebleeds.

Dentists sometimes use silver nitrate-infused swabs to heal oral ulcers. Silver nitrate is used by some podiatrists to kill cells located in the nail bed.

The Canadian physician C. A. Douglas Ringrose researched the use of silver nitrate for sterilization procedures, believing that silver nitrate could be used to block and corrode the fallopian tubes. The technique was ineffective.

===Disinfection===
Much research has been done in evaluating the ability of the silver ion at inactivating &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, a microorganism commonly used as an indicator for fecal contamination and as a surrogate for pathogens in drinking water treatment. Concentrations of silver nitrate evaluated in inactivation experiments range from 10–200 micrograms per liter as Ag+.
Silver&#x27;s antimicrobial activity saw many applications prior to the discovery of modern antibiotics, when it fell into near disuse. Its association with argyria made consumers wary and led them to turn away from it when given an alternative.

===Against warts===

Repeated daily application of silver nitrate can induce adequate destruction of cutaneous warts, but occasionally pigmented scars may develop. In a placebo-controlled study of 70 patients, silver nitrate given over nine days resulted in clearance of all warts in 43% and improvement in warts in 26% one month after treatment compared to 11% and 14%, respectively, in the placebo group.

==Safety==
As an oxidant, silver nitrate should be properly stored away from organic compounds. It reacts explosively with ethanol. Despite its common usage in extremely low concentrations to prevent gonorrhea and control nosebleeds, silver nitrate is still very toxic and corrosive. Brief exposure will not produce any immediate side effects other than the purple, brown or black stains on the skin, but upon constant exposure to high concentrations, side effects will be noticeable, which include burns. Long-term exposure may cause eye damage. Silver nitrate is known to be a skin and eye irritant. Silver nitrate has not been thoroughly investigated for potential carcinogenic effect.

Silver nitrate is currently unregulated in water sources by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. However, if more than 1 gram of silver is accumulated in the body, a condition called argyria may develop. Argyria is a permanent cosmetic condition in which the skin and internal organs turn a blue-gray color. The United States Environmental Protection Agency used to have a maximum contaminant limit for silver in water until 1990, when it was determined that argyria did not impact the function of any affected organs despite the discolouration. Argyria is more often associated with the consumption of colloidal silver solutions rather than with silver nitrate, since it is only used at extremely low concentrations to disinfect the water. However, it is still important to be wary before ingesting any sort of silver-ion solution.

<text>Strategic planning is an organization&#x27;s process of defining its strategy or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources to attain strategic goals.

Furthermore, it may also extend to control mechanisms for guiding the implementation of the strategy. Strategic planning became prominent in corporations during the 1960s and remains an important aspect of strategic management. It is executed by strategic planners or strategists, who involve many parties and research sources in their analysis of the organization and its relationship to the environment in which it competes.

&quot;Strategy&quot; has many definitions, but it generally involves setting strategic goals, determining actions to achieve the goals, setting a timeline, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources) in a given span of time. Often, Strategic planning is long term and organizational action steps are established from two to five years in the future. The senior leadership of an organization is generally tasked with determining strategy. Strategy can be planned (intended) or can be observed as a pattern of activity (emergent) as the organization adapts to its environment or competes in the market.

Strategy includes processes of formulation and implementation; strategic planning helps coordinate both. However, strategic planning is analytical in nature (i.e., it involves &quot;finding the dots&quot;); strategy formation itself involves synthesis (i.e., &quot;connecting the dots&quot;) via strategic thinking. As such, strategic planning occurs around the strategy formation activity.

Strategic planning can be used in Project Management that focuses on the development of standard methodology that is repeatable and will result to high chances of achieving project objectives. This requires a lot of thinking process and interaction among stakeholders. Strategic planning in Project Management provides an organization the framework and consistency of action. In addition, it ensures communication of overall goals and understanding roles of teams or individual to achieve them. The commitment of top management must be evident throughout the process to reduce resistance to change, ensure acceptance, and avoid common pitfalls. Strategic Planning does not guarantee success but will help improve likelihood of success of an organization.

In educational institutions, strategic planning is also a need. We are already in a transitional period in which old practices are no longer permanent but require revision to meet the needs of academia, which is frustrating in the educational sector. To meet the changing needs of this new society, educational institutions must reorganize. Finding ways to maintain achievements while improving effectiveness can be difficult for educational institutions. Keeping up with society&#x27;s rapid changes. Some strategic planners are hesitant to address societal outcomes, so they often ignore them and assume they will happen on their own. Instead of defining the vision for how we want our children to live, they direct their attention to courses, content, and resources with the mistaken belief that societally useful outcomes will follow. When this occurs, the true strategic plan is never developed or implemented.

==Process==
===Overview===
Strategic planning is a process and thus has inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes. This process, like all processes, has constraints. It may be formal or informal and is typically iterative, with feedback loops throughout the process. Some elements of the process may be continuous and others may be executed as discrete projects with a definitive start and end during a period. Strategic planning provides inputs for strategic thinking, which guides the actual strategy formation. Typical strategic planning efforts include the evaluation of the organization&#x27;s mission and strategic issues to strengthen current practices and determine the need for new programming. The end result is the organization&#x27;s strategy, including a diagnosis of the environment and competitive situation, a guiding policy on what the organization intends to accomplish, and key initiatives or action plans for achieving the guiding policy.

Michael Porter wrote in 1980 that formulation of competitive strategy includes consideration of four key elements:
#Company strengths and weaknesses;
#Personal values of the key implementers (i.e., management and the board); 
#Industry opportunities and threats;
#Broader societal expectations.
The first two elements relate to factors internal to the company (i.e., the internal environment), while the latter two relate to factors external to the company (i.e., the external environment). These elements are considered throughout the strategic planning process.

===Inputs===
Data is gathered from various sources, such as interviews with key executives, review of publicly available documents on the competition or market, primary research (e.g., visiting or observing competitor places of business or comparing prices), industry studies, reports of the organization&#x27;s performance, etc. This may be part of a competitive intelligence program. Inputs are gathered to help establish a baseline, support an understanding of the competitive environment and its opportunities and risks. Other inputs include an understanding of the values of key stakeholders, such as the board, shareholders, and senior management. These values may be captured in an organization&#x27;s vision and mission statements.

===Activities===

Strategic planning activities include meetings and other communication among the organization&#x27;s leaders and personnel to develop a common understanding regarding the competitive environment and what the organization&#x27;s response to that environment should be. A variety of strategic planning tools may be completed as part of strategic planning activities.

The organization&#x27;s leaders may have a series of questions they want to be answered in formulating the strategy and gathering inputs.

===Outputs===
The output of strategic planning includes documentation and communication describing the organization&#x27;s strategy and how it should be implemented, sometimes referred to as the strategic plan. The strategy may include a diagnosis of the competitive situation, a guiding policy for achieving the organization&#x27;s goals, and specific action plans to be implemented. A strategic plan may cover multiple years and be updated periodically.

The organization may use a variety of methods of measuring and monitoring progress towards the strategic objectives and measures established, such as a balanced scorecard or strategy map. Organizations may also plan their financial statements (i.e., balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows) for several years when developing their strategic plan, as part of the goal-setting activity. The term &quot;operational budget&quot; is often used to describe the expected financial performance of an organization for the upcoming year. Capital budgets very often form the backbone of a strategic plan, especially as it increasingly relates to Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

===Outcomes===
While the planning process produces outputs, strategy implementation or execution of the strategic plan produces outcomes. These outcomes will invariably differ from the strategic goals. How close they are to the strategic goals and vision will determine the success or failure of the strategic plan. Unintended outcomes might also be an issue. They need to be attended to and understood for strategy development and execution to be a true learning process.

==Tools and approaches==

A variety of analytical tools and techniques are used in strategic planning. These were developed by companies and management consulting firms to help provide a framework for strategic planning. Such tools include:
* PEST analysis, which covers the remote external environment elements such as political, economic, social and technological (PESTLE adds legal/regulatory and ecological/environmental); 
* Scenario planning, which was originally used in the military and recently used by large corporations to analyze future scenarios.
* Porter five forces analysis, which addresses industry attractiveness and rivalry through the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers and the threat of substitute products and new market entrants;
* SWOT analysis, which addresses internal strengths and weaknesses relative to the external opportunities and threats; 
* Growth-share matrix, which involves portfolio decisions about which businesses to retain or divest; and
* Balanced scorecards and strategy maps, which creates a systematic framework for measuring and controlling strategy.
*Responsive evaluation, which uses a constructivist evaluation approach to identify the outcomes of objectives, which then supports future strategic planning exercises.
*VRIO Framework, which determines the competitive advantage of a product or a service through evaluating four elements such as value, rarity, imitability and organization.

==Strategic planning vs. financial planning==
Simply extending financial statement projections into the future without consideration of the competitive environment is a form of financial planning or budgeting, not strategic planning. In business, the term &quot;financial plan&quot; is often used to describe the expected financial performance of an organization for future periods. The term &quot;budget&quot; is used for a financial plan for the upcoming year. A &quot;forecast&quot; is typically a combination of actual performance year-to-date plus expected performance for the remainder of the year, so is generally compared against plan or budget and prior performance. The financial plans accompanying a strategic plan may include three–five years of projected performance.

McKinsey &amp; Company developed a capability maturity model in the 1970s to describe the sophistication of planning processes, with strategic management ranked the highest. The four stages include:
#Financial planning, which is primarily about annual budgets and a functional focus, with limited regard for the environment;
#Forecast-based planning, which includes multi-year financial plans and more robust capital allocation across business units;
#Externally oriented planning, where a thorough situation analysis and competitive assessment is performed; 
#Strategic management, where widespread strategic thinking occurs and a well-defined strategic framework is used.
Categories 3 and 4 are strategic planning, while the first two categories are non-strategic or essentially financial planning. Each stage builds on the previous stages; that is, a stage 4 organization completes activities in all four categories.

Later McKinsey research undertaken and published in 2006 found that, although many companies had a formal strategic-planning process, the process was not being used for their &quot;most important decisions&quot;.

For Michael C. Sekora, Project Socrates founder in the Reagan White House, during the cold war the economically challenged Soviet Union was able to keep on western military capabilities by using technology-based planning while the U.S. was slowed by finance-based planning, until the Reagan administration launched the Socrates Project, which should be revived to keep up with China as an emerging superpower.

==Criticism==

===Strategic planning vs. strategic thinking===
Strategic planning has been criticized for attempting to systematize strategic thinking and strategy formation, which Henry Mintzberg argues are inherently creative activities involving synthesis or &quot;connecting the dots&quot; which cannot be systematized. Mintzberg argues that strategic planning can help coordinate planning efforts and measure progress on strategic goals, but that it occurs &quot;around&quot; the strategy formation process rather than within it. It functions remote from the &quot;front lines&quot; or contact with the competitive environment (i.e., in business, facing the customer where the effect of competition is most clearly evident) may not be effective at supporting strategy efforts.

===Evidence on strategic planning&#x27;s impact===
While much criticism surrounds strategic planning, evidence suggests that it does work. In a 2019 meta-analysis including data from almost 9,000 public and private organizations, strategic planning is found to have a positive impact on organizational performance. Strategic planning is particularly potent in enhancing an organization&#x27;s capacity to achieve its goals (i.e., effectiveness). However, the study argues that just having a plan is not enough. For strategic planning to work, it needs to include some formality (i.e., including an analysis of the internal and external environment and the stipulation of strategies, goals and plans based on these analyses), comprehensiveness (i.e., producing many strategic options before selecting the course to follow) and careful stakeholder management (i.e., thinking carefully about whom to involve during the different steps of the strategic planning process, how, when and why).

=== Strategic plans as tools to communicate and control ===
Henry Mintzberg in the article &quot;The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning&quot; (1994), argued that the lesson that should be accepted is that managers will never be able to take charge of strategic planning through a formalized process. Therefore, he underscored the role of plans as tools to communicate and control. It ensures that there is coordination wherein everyone in the organization is moving in the same direction. The plans are the prime media communicating the management&#x27;s strategic intentions, thereby promoting a common direction instead of individual discretion. It is also the tool to secure the support of the organization&#x27;s external sphere, such as financiers, suppliers or government agencies, who are helping achieve the organization&#x27;s plans and goals.

== The strategic plan genre of communication ==
Cornut, et al (2012) studied the particular features of the strategic plan genre of communication by examining a corpus of strategic plans from public and non-profit organizations. They defined strategic plans as the &quot;key material manifestation&quot; of organizations&#x27; strategies and argued that, even though strategic plans are specific to an organization, there is a generic quality that draws on shared institutional understanding on the substance, form and communicative purposes of the strategic plan. Hence, they posit that strategic plan is a genre of organizational communication (Bhatia, 2004; Yates and Orlikowski, 1992 as cited in Cornut et al., 2012). In this sense, genre is defined as the &quot;conventionalized discursive actions in which participating individuals or institutions have shared perceptions of communicative purposes as well as those of constraints operating their construction, interpretation and conditions of use&quot;  (Bhatia, 2004: 87; see also Frow, 2005; Swales, 1990 as cited in Cornut et al., 2012).

The authors compared the corpus of strategic plans with nine other corpora. This included annual reports from the public sector and nongovernment organizations, research articles, project plans, executive speeches, State of the Union addresses, horoscopes, religious sermons, business magazine articles and annual reports for-profit corporations included in the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s 500 largest companies (S&amp;P 500).

The authors used textual analysis, including content analysis and corpus linguistics. Content analysis was used to identify themes and concepts, such as values and cognition; while corpus linguistics was used to identify naturally occurring texts and patterns (Biber, et al, 1998 as cited in Cornut et al., 2012).

=== Taking a stance ===
The strategic plans showed significantly less self-reference than all other corpora, with the exemption of project plans and S&amp;P 500 annual reports. The results indicated that strategic plans have more moderate verbs of deontic value. This was interpreted as an indication that &quot;commands and commitments are not overtly hedged, but neither are they particularly strong&quot;.

Guidance on the sections of a strategic plan abound but there are few studies about the nature of language used for these documents. Cornut, et al&#x27;s (2012) study showed that writers of strategic plans have a shared understanding of what is the appropriate language. Thus, the authors argued, a true strategist is one who is able to instantiate the genre strategic plan through appropriate application of language.

=== Strategic planning as communicative process ===
Spee, et. al. (2011) explored the strategic planning as communicative process based on Ricoeur&#x27;s concepts of decontextualization and recontextualization, they conceptualize strategic planning activities as being constituted through the iterative and recursive relationship of talk and text, this elaborate the construction of a strategic plan as a communicative process. 
This study looks at the way that texts within the planning process, such as PowerPoint presentations, planning documents and targets that are part of a strategic plan, are constructed in preparation, through a series of communicative interface. Throughout the process, strategy documents were essential in detaining the developing strategy as they were constantly revised up until an ultimate plan was accepted.

The book edited by Mandeville-Gamble (2015) sees the roles of managers as important in terms of communicating the strategic vision of the organization. Many of the authors in the book by Mandeville-Gamble agree that a strategic plan is merely an unrealized vision unless it is widely shared and sparks the willingness to change within individuals in the organization. Similarly, Goodman in 2017 emphasized that the advent of the internet and social media has become one of the most important vehicle to which corporate strategic plan can be distributed to an organizations internal and external stakeholders. This distribution of knowledge allows for staff of organization to access and share the institutional thinking this able to reformulate it in their own words.

===Strategic planning through control mechanisms===

Strategic planning through control mechanisms (mostly by the way of a communication program) is set in the hopes of coming to desired outcomes that reflect company or organizational goals. As further supplement to this idea, controls can also be realized in both measurable and intangible controls, specifically output controls, behavioural controls, and clan controls. By way of simple definition, output controls work toward to tangible and quantifiable results; behavioural controls are geared toward behaviours of people in an organization; and clan controls are dependent and are executed while keeping in mind norms, traditions, and organizational culture. All these three are implemented in order to keep systems and strategies running and focused toward desired results (n.d.).

===Strategic planning, learning organizations, and communication===

Strategic planning is both the impetus for and result of critical thinking, optimization, and motivation for the growth and development of organizations. The core disciplines, which are inherent in systems thinking, personal and organizational mastery, mental models, building a shared vision, and team learning. In a time of machine learning and data analytics, these core disciplines remain to be relevant in so far as having human resource and human interest become the driving force behind organizations.

Moreover, it cannot be denied that communication plays a role in the realization of learning organizations and strategic planning. In a study by Barker and Camarata (1998), the authors noted that there are theories that could explain the invaluable role of communication, and these are from Rational Choice Theory to Social Exchange Theory where costs, rewards, and outcomes are valued in maintaining communication and thus relationships to serve the ends of an organization and its members. Thus, while many organizations and companies try their best to become learning organizations and exercise strategic planning, without communication, relationships fail and the core disciplines are never truly met (Barker &amp; Camarata, 1998).

<text>Team building is a collective term for various types of activities used to enhance social relations and define roles within teams, often involving collaborative tasks. It is distinct from team training, which is designed by a combination of business managers, learning and development/OD (Internal or external) and an HR Business Partner (if the role exists) to improve the efficiency, rather than interpersonal relations.

Many team-building exercises aim to expose and address interpersonal problems within the group.

Over time, these activities are intended to improve performance in a team-based environment. Team building is one of the foundations of organizational development that can be applied to groups such as sports teams, school classes, military units or flight crews. The formal definition of team-building includes:
* aligning around goals
* building effective working relationships
* reducing team members&#x27; role ambiguity
* finding solutions to team problems

Team building is one of the most widely used group-development activities in organizations. A common strategy is to have a &quot;team-building retreat&quot; or &quot;corporate love-in,&quot; where team members try to address underlying concerns and build trust by engaging in activities that are not part of what they ordinarily do as a team.

Of all organizational activities, one study found team-development to have the strongest effect (versus financial measures) for improving organizational performance. A 2008 meta-analysis found that team-development activities, including team building and team training, improve both a team&#x27;s objective performance and that team&#x27;s subjective supervisory ratings. Team building can also be achieved by targeted personal self-disclosure activities.

== Four approaches ==
Team building describe four approaches to team building:

=== Setting goals ===
This emphasizes the importance of clear objectives and team goals. Team members become involved in action planning to identify ways to define success and failure and achieve goals. This is intended to strengthen motivation and foster a sense of ownership. By identifying specific outcomes and tests of incremental success, teams can measure their progress. Many organizations negotiate a team charter with the team and (union leaders)

=== Role clarification ===
This emphasizes improving team members&#x27; understanding of their own and others&#x27; respective roles and duties. This is intended to reduce ambiguity and foster understanding of the importance of structure by activities aimed at defining and adjusting roles. It emphasizes the members&#x27; interdependence and the value of having each member focus on their own role in the team&#x27;s success.

=== Problem solving ===
This emphasizes identifying major problems

=== Interpersonal-relations ===
This emphasizes increasing teamwork skills such as giving and receiving support, communication and sharing. Teams with fewer interpersonal conflicts generally function more effectively than others. A facilitator guides the conversations to develop mutual trust and open communication between team members.

== Effectiveness ==
The effectiveness of team building differs substantially from one organization to another. The most effective efforts occur when team members are interdependent, knowledgeable and experienced and when organizational leadership actively establishes and supports the team.

When teams are assembled, team dynamics are huge in terms of creating an effective team. Dr. Frank La Fasto identifies five dynamics that are fundamental to team effectiveness. The five dynamics of effectiveness within teams are given below.

1)      Team Membership

·        Team Membership is the members that make up the team.

2)      Team Relationship

·        Team Relationship is the relationship team members have with each other and how they interact and coexist.

3)      Team Problem Solving

·        Team Problem Solving is the members within a team coming to a conclusive yet innovative solution to the problem at hand.

4)      Team Leadership

·        Team Leadership is the leader of the team and the qualities and traits they must possess to lead a team effectively.

5)      Organizational Environment

·        Organizational Environment is the environment from which a team works in and can directly correlate to team effectiveness.

Effective team building incorporates an awareness of team objectives. Teams must work to develop goals, roles and procedures. As a result, team building is usually associated with increasing task accomplishment, goal meeting, and achievement of results within teams.

Some research indicates that team building is not as effective as it seems, and despite causing people to feel closer initially, that is often short-lived. This research indicates that starting with individual motivation is a better starting point than team building (focus on relationships and trust) when seeking to improve the level of quality collaboration.

== Effect on performance ==
Team building has been scientifically shown to positively affect team effectiveness. Goal setting and role clarification were shown to have impact on cognitive, affective, process and performance outcomes. They had the most powerful impact on affective and process outcomes, which implies that team building can help benefit teams experiencing issues with negative affect, such as lack of cohesion or trust. It could also improve teams suffering from process issues, such as lack of clarification in roles.

Goal setting and role clarification have the greatest impact because they enhance motivation, reduce conflict and help to set individual purposes, goals and motivation.

Teams with 10 or more members appear to benefit the most from team building. This is attributed to larger teams having – generally speaking – a greater reservoir of cognitive resources and capabilities than smaller teams.

== Challenges to team building ==
The term &#x27;team building&#x27; is often used as a dodge when organizations are looking for a &#x27;quick fix&#x27; to poor communication systems or unclear leadership directives, leading to unproductive teams with no clear of how to be successful. Team work is the best work.

Teams are then assembled to address specific problems, while the underlying causes are not ignored.

Dyer highlighted three challenges for team builders:

* Lack of teamwork skills: One of the challenges facing leaders is to find team-oriented employees. Most organizations rely on educational institutions to have inculcated these skills into students. Dyer believed however, that students are encouraged to work individually and succeed without having to collaborate. This works against the kinds of behavior needed for teamwork. Another study found that team training improved cognitive, affective, process and performance outcomes. Employee resistance and lack of teamwork skills may result where employees are required to work with other employees with whom they are unfamiliar. In this case, the new teams are breaking up established social relationships.
* Virtual workplaces and across organizational boundaries: according to Dyer, organizations individuals who are not in the same physical space increasingly work together. Members are typically unable to build concrete relationships with other team members. Another study found that face-to-face communication is very important in building an effective team environment. Face-to-face contact was key to developing trust. Formal team building sessions with a facilitator led the members to &quot;agree to the relationship&quot; and define how the teams were work. Informal contact was also mentioned.
* Globalization and virtualization: Teams increasingly include members who have dissimilar languages, cultures, values and problem-solving approaches problems. One-to-one meetings has been successful in some organizations.

The International Journal of Management and Entrepreneurship highlights the point of groupthink being another challenge within team building. A group thinking or making decisions in a way that discourages creativity or individual control creates potential for increased conflict over decision making.

Another challenge to team building include three types of conflict that can occur which are task conflict, process conflict and relationship conflict.

* Task Conflict: Conflict over the work or goals of the project, including different approaches, perspectives and interpretations
* Process Conflict: Conflict over how the logistics of the work are completed and assigning responsibilities
* Relationship Conflict: Conflict over interpersonal relationships, including personality clashes, differing personal views and perspectives.

== Application of team building ==

=== Schools ===

Instructors can motivate students to develop teamwork skills and provide a guideline on how professors can help students build effective study/project teams. This approach emphasizes examples of job situations that require teamwork skills.

=== Organizations ===
Team building in organizations is a common approach to improving performance.

Fun is an important component to team building, but the intent is to become productive, focused, and aligned. Purely recreational activities can be helpful, but must be timed and consider the capabilities of team members (e.g., sports are not for everyone). Other activities geared toward creating a learning environment, exceeding results and engaging employees must be present.

Employee engagement and Team-building exercises allow teams to create solutions that are meaningful to them, with direct impact on the individuals, the team and the organization. Experiential learning and ramification methods are effective ways to engage millennials in the workplace. Employee engagement is effective because:
* employees enjoy problem-solving activities;
* problem-solving creates ownership;
* it can increase capacity; 
* competitive activities encourage a results-based outlook.

Outdoor activities can be an effective way to engage the team, but there are many different types of team building activities possible.

In 2011, senior Human Resource leaders at Mars Inc. conducted a study on their global workforce to better understand team collaboration and team effectiveness, as they like many companies, had spent large sums of money on team building activities without much return on these investments of money and time. Their study, published in the Harvard Business Review, determined that employees are motivated by a sense of accountability for their work and strong relationships and trust are forged outcomes of dedicated people striving together. Putting success-minded people together is what unlocks productive teamwork more so than offsite, company directed teambuilding activities.

=== Sports ===
Team building was introduced in sports in the 1990s. A 2010 study that analyzed the effects of team building found that team building activities increase group cohesion.

According to Yukelson, &quot;In sports, teams are made up of a collection of interdependent individuals, coordinated and orchestrated into various task efficient roles for the purpose of achieving goals and objectives that are deemed important for that particular team&quot;.

Team building in sports develops behaviors and skills that “result in improvements in team effectiveness.” A basic tenet of team building is when team members foster a sense of unity, or togetherness. This creates a catalyzing function bolstering the individual members&#x27; efforts through increased motivation. This directs them towards their common goals, and improves team performance outcomes.

A study examined whether a team building intervention program that stressed the importance of goal setting increased cohesion: 86 high school basketball players were studied. The hypothesis employed season-long goal setting. Participants were asked to individually assign targets for the team and negotiate with other team members to finalize a goal score for the team.

In the control branch, the coach occasionally encouraged participants to cheer for and support other team members. The research concluded that at the beginning of the study, all the teams had the same level of cohesion, but the team with the season long goal setting intervention program performed better.

The level of team cohesion did not increase as a result of ceiling effect with the intervention program, but the level decreased significantly for the control group. This was attributed to the lack of emphasis on team goals.

Core components for building a successful sports team:
* The coach communicates the goals and objectives to the team, defining roles and group norms.
* Team members should know what is expected from them. Mission statements can encourage the team to support each in achieving the goals.
* Team members should be trained that the team comes first and that each member is accountable for individual action and the actions of the team as a whole.
* &quot;Team culture refers to the psychosocial leadership within the team, team motives, team identity, team sport and collective efficacy&quot;. The coach builds a positive culture. This can be done during recruiting for team-oriented athletes. 
* Instill a sense of pride in group membership. Team identity can be created by motivating team members commit to team goals and have pride in performance.
* Open and honest communication process can bring the team together. This includes both verbal and non-verbal communication. Trust, honesty, mutual sharing and understanding should be emphasized. The team members should be encouraged and given the chance to speak during debriefing sessions.
* Teammates help each other before, after and during games.

Benefits of team building in sports include; 
*Improved team cohesion.
*Improved communications skills on and off field.
*Increased motivation and enjoyment.
*Builds player to player and player to manager trust.
*Mitigates conflict.
*Encourages communication.

<text>, also known as , was the son of Oda Nobuhide and younger brother of Oda Nobunaga, who lived during the Sengoku period of Japan.

Nobuyuki conspired against his brother Nobunaga with the Hayashi clan (Owari), which Nobunaga viewed as treason. Nobuyuki&#x27;s Suemori Castle was reduced by Ikeda Nobuteru. Nobuyuki was pardoned, however in 1558 it was discovered that he had been planning yet another revolt and Nobuyuki was executed.

<text>The Pleasure Garden is a 1953 short film written and directed by James Broughton, starring Hattie Jacques, Lindsay Anderson, and John Le Mesurier.

== Plot ==
Filmed among the ruins of the Crystal Palace Terraces, &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; is a poetic ode to desire, featuring a bureaucrat determined to stamp out any form of free expression.

== Cast ==
* Hattie Jacques as Mrs Albion
* Diana Maddox as Bess
* Kermit Sheets as Sam
* Jean Anderson as Aunt Minerva
* John Le Mesurier as Colonel Pall K. Gargoyle
* Maxine Audley as Lady Ennui
* Derek Hart as Lord Ennui
* Jill Bennett as Miss Kellerman
* Lindsay Anderson as Michael-Angelico
* John Heawood as Mr Nurmi
* Hilary Mackendrick as Miss Wheeling
* Gladys Spencer as Mrs Jennybelle
* Gontron Goulden as Doctor Hemingway
* Victoria Grayson as Miss Greaves
* Mary Lee Settle as Mme Paganini
* Daphne Hunter as Girl in Grass

== Reception ==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;This light extravaganza by the Californian poet James Broughton, whose 16-mm films (&quot;Mothers&#x27; Day&quot;, &quot;Loony Tom&quot;, etc.) have been seen over here, was financed by private subscription and shot entirely on location in the Crystal Palace Gardens, a perfect setting. It is a highly personal mixture of lyricism, mime, whimsy and caprice; some may find it too tenuous, but those who like it will like it very much indeed. It has a freedom all too rare in the cinema, and it is all freshly, unassumingly imagined: a real, a genuine lark. Professional and non-professional actors blend homogeneously under the director&#x27;s eccentric guidance, Stanley Bate&#x27;s music is full of entirely appropriate gaiety and invention, and Walter Lassally&#x27;s photography is resourceful and attractively framed.&quot;

== Accolades ==
The film won the Prix de Fantasie Poetique at Cannes in 1954.

== Home media ==
&quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; was released on DVD in the UK by the BFI on 15 February 2010. The release also includes &quot;The Phoenix Tower&quot; (UK, 1957, 39 min.), a short documentary charting the construction of the BBC&#x27;s Crystal Palace Television Tower, plus a fully illustrated booklet with film notes, an original review and a history of the Crystal Palace.

<text>An intellectual is a person who engages in critical thinking, research, and reflection about the nature of reality, especially the nature of society and proposed solutions for its normative problems. Coming from the world of culture, either as a creator or as a mediator, the intellectual participates in politics, either to defend a concrete proposition or to denounce an injustice, usually by either rejecting, producing or extending an ideology, and by defending a system of values.

== Etymological background ==

=== &quot;Man of letters&quot; ===

The term &quot;man of letters&quot; derives from the French term &quot;belletrist&quot; or &quot;homme de lettres&quot; but is not synonymous with &quot;an academic&quot;. A &quot;man of letters&quot; was a literate man, able to read and write, and thus highly valued in the upper strata of society in a time when literacy was rare. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the term &quot;Belletrist(s)&quot; came to be applied to the &quot;literati&quot;: the French participants in—sometimes referred to as &quot;citizens&quot; of—the Republic of Letters, which evolved into the salon, a social institution, usually run by a hostess, meant for the edification, education, and cultural refinement of the participants.

In the late 19th century, when literacy was relatively common in European countries such as the United Kingdom, the &quot;Man of Letters&quot; (&quot;littérateur&quot;) denotation broadened to mean &quot;specialized&quot;, a man who earned his living writing intellectually (not creatively) about literature: the essayist, the journalist, the critic, et al. Examples include Samuel Johnson, Walter Scott and Thomas Carlyle. In the 20th century, such an approach was gradually superseded by the academic method, and the term &quot;Man of Letters&quot; became disused, replaced by the generic term &quot;intellectual&quot;, describing the intellectual person. The archaic term is the basis of the names of several academic institutions which call themselves Colleges of Letters and Science.

=== &quot;Intellectual&quot; ===
The earliest record of the English noun &quot;intellectual&quot; is found in the 19th century, where in 1813, Byron reports that &#x27;I wish I may be well enough to listen to these intellectuals&#x27;. Over the course of the 19th century, other variants of the already established adjective &#x27;intellectual&#x27; as a noun appeared in English and in French, where in the 1890s the noun () formed from the adjective appeared with higher frequency in the literature.
Collini writes about this time that &quot;[a]mong this cluster of linguistic experiments there occurred ... the occasional usage of &#x27;intellectuals&#x27; as a plural noun to refer, usually with a figurative or ironic intent, to a collection of people who might be identified in terms of their intellectual inclinations or pretensions.&quot;

In early 19th-century Britain, Samuel Taylor Coleridge coined the term &quot;clerisy&quot;, the intellectual class responsible for upholding and maintaining the national culture, the secular equivalent of the Anglican clergy. Likewise, in Tsarist Russia, there arose the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; (1860s–1870s), who were the status class of white-collar workers. 
For Germany, the theologian Alister McGrath said that &quot;the emergence of a socially alienated, theologically literate, antiestablishment lay intelligentsia is one of the more significant phenomena of the social history of Germany in the 1830s&quot;. An intellectual class in Europe was socially important, especially to self-styled intellectuals, whose participation in society&#x27;s arts, politics, journalism, and education—of either nationalist, internationalist, or ethnic sentiment—constitute &quot;vocation of the intellectual&quot;. Moreover, some intellectuals were anti-academic, despite universities (the academy) being synonymous with intellectualism.

In France, the Dreyfus affair (1894–1906), an identity crisis of antisemitic nationalism for the French Third Republic (1870–1940), marked the full emergence of the &quot;intellectual in public life&quot;, especially Émile Zola, Octave Mirbeau and Anatole France directly addressing the matter of French antisemitism to the public; thenceforward, &quot;intellectual&quot; became common, yet initially derogatory, usage; its French noun usage is attributed to Georges Clemenceau in 1898. Nevertheless, by 1930 the term &quot;intellectual&quot; passed from its earlier pejorative associations and restricted usages to a widely accepted term and it was because of the Dreyfus Affair that the term also acquired generally accepted use in English.

In the 20th century, the term intellectual acquired positive connotations of social prestige, derived from possessing intellect and intelligence, especially when the intellectual&#x27;s activities exerted positive consequences in the public sphere and so increased the intellectual understanding of the public, by means of moral responsibility, altruism, and solidarity, without resorting to the manipulations of demagoguery, paternalism and incivility (condescension). The sociologist Frank Furedi said that &quot;Intellectuals are not defined according to the jobs they do, but [by] the manner in which they act, the way they see themselves, and the [social and political] values that they uphold.

According to Thomas Sowell, as a descriptive term of person, personality, and profession, the word &quot;intellectual&quot; identifies three traits:
# Educated; erudition for developing theories;
# Productive; creates cultural capital in the fields of philosophy, literary criticism, and sociology, law, medicine, and science, etc.; and
# Artistic; creates art in literature, music, painting, sculpture, etc.

== Historical uses ==
In Latin language, at least starting from the Carolingian Empire, intellectuals could be called &quot;litterati&quot;, a term which is sometimes applied today.

The word intellectual is found in Indian scripture Mahabharata in the Bachelorette meeting (Swayamvara Sava) of Draupadi. Immediately after Arjuna and Raja-Maharaja (kings-emperors) came to the meeting, &quot;Nipuna Buddhijibina (perfect intellectuals)&quot; appeared at the meeting.

In Imperial China in the period from 206 BC until AD 1912, the intellectuals were the &quot;Scholar-officials&quot; (&quot;Scholar-gentlemen&quot;), who were civil servants appointed by the Emperor of China to perform the tasks of daily governance. Such civil servants earned academic degrees by means of imperial examination, and were often also skilled calligraphers or Confucian philosophers. Historian Wing-Tsit Chan concludes that:

In Joseon Korea (1392–1910), the intellectuals were the &quot;literati&quot;, who knew how to read and write, and had been designated, as the chungin (the &quot;middle people&quot;), in accordance with the Confucian system. Socially, they constituted the petite bourgeoisie, composed of scholar-bureaucrats (scholars, professionals, and technicians) who administered the dynastic rule of the Joseon dynasty.

== Public intellectual ==

The term public intellectual describes the intellectual participating in the public-affairs discourse of society, in addition to an academic career. Regardless of their academic fields or professional expertise, public intellectuals address and respond to the normative problems of society, and, as such, are expected to be impartial critics who can &quot;rise above the partial preoccupation of one&#x27;s own profession—and engage with the global issues of truth, judgment, and taste of the time&quot;. In &quot;Representations of the Intellectual&quot; (1994), Edward Saïd said that the &quot;true intellectual is, therefore, always an outsider, living in self-imposed exile, and on the margins of society&quot;. Public intellectuals usually arise from the educated élite of a society, although the North American usage of the term &quot;intellectual&quot; includes the university academics. The difference between &quot;intellectual&quot; and &quot;academic&quot; is participation in the realm of public affairs.

Jürgen Habermas&#x27; &quot;Structural Transformation of Public Sphere&quot; (1963) made significant contribution to the notion of public intellectual by historically and conceptually delineating the idea of private and public. Controversial, in the same year, was Ralf Dahrendorf&#x27;s definition: &quot;As the court-jesters of modern society, all intellectuals have the duty to doubt everything that is obvious, to make relative all authority, to ask all those questions that no one else dares to ask&quot;.

An intellectual usually is associated with an ideology or with a philosophy. The Czech intellectual Václav Havel said that politics and intellectuals can be linked, but that moral responsibility for the intellectual&#x27;s ideas, even when advocated by a politician, remains with the intellectual. Therefore, it is best to avoid utopian intellectuals who offer &#x27;universal insights&#x27; to resolve the problems of political economy with public policies that might harm and that have harmed civil society; that intellectuals be mindful of the social and cultural ties created with their words, insights and ideas; and should be heard as social critics of politics and power.

=== Public engagement ===
The determining factor for a &quot;thinker&quot; (historian, philosopher, scientist, writer, artist) to be considered a public intellectual is the degree to which the individual is implicated and engaged with the vital reality of the contemporary world, i.e. participation in the public affairs of society. Consequently, being designated as a public intellectual is determined by the degree of influence of the designator&#x27;s motivations, opinions, and options of action (social, political, ideological), and by affinity with the given thinker.

After the failure of the large-scale May 68 movement in France, intellectuals within the country were often maligned for having specific areas of expertise while discussing general subjects like democracy. Intellectuals increasingly claimed to be within marginalized groups rather than their spokespeople, and centered their activism on the social problems relevant to their areas of expertise (such as gender relations in the case of psychologists). A similar shift occurred in China after the Tiananmen Square Massacre from the &quot;universal intellectual&quot; (who plans better futures from within academia) to &quot;minjian&quot; (&quot;grassroots&quot;) intellectuals, the latter group represented by such figures as Wang Xiaobo, social scientist Yu Jianrong, and &quot;Yanhuang Chunqiu&quot; editor Ding Dong ().

=== Public policy ===
In the matters of public policy, the public intellectual connects scholarly research to the practical matters of solving societal problems. The British sociologist Michael Burawoy, an exponent of public sociology, said that professional sociology has failed by giving insufficient attention to resolving social problems, and that a dialogue between the academic and the layman would bridge the gap. An example is how Chilean intellectuals worked to reestablish democracy within the right-wing, neoliberal governments of the military dictatorship of 1973–1990, the Pinochet régime allowed professional opportunities for some liberal and left-wing social scientists to work as politicians and as consultants in effort to realize the theoretical economics of the Chicago Boys, but their access to power was contingent upon political pragmatism, abandoning the political neutrality of the academic intellectual.

In &quot;The Sociological Imagination&quot; (1959), C. Wright Mills said that academics had become ill-equipped for participating in public discourse, and that journalists usually are &quot;more politically alert and knowledgeable than sociologists, economists, and especially ... political scientists&quot;. That, because the universities of the U.S. are bureaucratic, private businesses, they &quot;do not teach critical reasoning to the student&quot;, who then does not know &quot;how to gauge what is going on in the general struggle for power in modern society&quot;. Likewise, Richard Rorty criticized the quality of participation of intellectuals in public discourse as an example of the &quot;civic irresponsibility of intellect, especially academic intellect&quot;.
 The American legal scholar Richard Posner said that the participation of academic public intellectuals in the public life of society is characterized by logically untidy and politically biased statements of the kind that would be unacceptable to academia. He concluded that there are few ideologically and politically independent public intellectuals, and disapproved public intellectuals who limit themselves to practical matters of public policy, and not with values or public philosophy, or public ethics, or public theology, nor with matters of moral and spiritual outrage.

== Intellectual status class==
Socially, intellectuals constitute the intelligentsia, a status class organised either by ideology (e.g., conservatism, fascism, socialism, liberalism, reactionary, revolutionary, democratic, communism), or by nationality (American intellectuals, French intellectuals, Ibero–American intellectuals, &quot;et al.&quot;). The term &quot;intelligentsiya&quot; originated from Tsarist Russia (–1870s), where it denotes the social stratum of those possessing intellectual formation (schooling, education), and who were Russian society&#x27;s counterpart to the German &quot;Bildungsbürgertum&quot; and to the French &quot;bourgeoisie éclairée&quot;, the enlightened middle classes of those realms.

In Marxist philosophy, the social class function of the intellectuals (the intelligentsia) is to be the source of progressive ideas for the transformation of society: providing advice and counsel to the political leaders, interpreting the country&#x27;s politics to the mass of the population (urban workers and peasants). In the pamphlet &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot; (1902), Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924) said that vanguard-party revolution required the participation of the intellectuals to explain the complexities of socialist ideology to the uneducated proletariat and the urban industrial workers in order to integrate them to the revolution because &quot;the history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own efforts, is able to develop only trade-union consciousness&quot; and will settle for the limited, socio-economic gains so achieved. In Russia as in Continental Europe, socialist theory was the product of the &quot;educated representatives of the propertied classes&quot;, of &quot;revolutionary socialist intellectuals&quot;, such as were Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

The Hungarian Marxist philosopher György Lukács (1885–1971) identified the intelligentsia as the privileged social class who provide revolutionary leadership. By means of intelligible and accessible interpretation, the intellectuals explain to the workers and peasants the &quot;Who?&quot;, the &quot;How?&quot; and the &quot;Why?&quot; of the social, economic and political &quot;status quo&quot;—the ideological totality of society—and its practical, revolutionary application to the transformation of their society.

The Italian communist theoretician Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937) developed Karl Marx&#x27;s conception of the intelligentsia to include political leadership in the public sphere. That because &quot;all knowledge is existentially-based&quot;, the intellectuals, who create and preserve knowledge, are &quot;spokesmen for different social groups, and articulate particular social interests&quot;. That intellectuals occur in each social class and throughout the right-wing, the centre and the left-wing of the political spectrum and that as a social class the &quot;intellectuals view themselves as autonomous from the ruling class&quot; of their society.

Addressing their role as a social class, Jean-Paul Sartre said that intellectuals are the moral conscience of their age; that their moral and ethical responsibilities are to observe the socio-political moment, and to freely speak to their society, in accordance with their consciences.

The British historian Norman Stone said that the intellectual social class misunderstand the reality of society and so are doomed to the errors of logical fallacy, ideological stupidity, and poor planning hampered by ideology. In her memoirs, the Conservative politician Margaret Thatcher wrote that the anti-monarchical French Revolution (1789–1799) was &quot;a utopian attempt to overthrow a traditional order [...] in the name of abstract ideas, formulated by vain intellectuals&quot;.

=== Latin America ===
The American academic Peter H. Smith describes the intellectuals of Latin America as people from an identifiable social class, who have been conditioned by that common experience and thus are inclined to share a set of common assumptions (values and ethics); that ninety-four per cent of intellectuals come either from the middle class or from the upper class and that only six per cent come from the working class.
Philosopher Steven Fuller said that because cultural capital confers power and social status as a status group they must be autonomous in order to be credible as intellectuals:

=== United States ===
The 19th-century U.S. Congregational theologian Edwards Amasa Park said: &quot;We do wrong to our own minds, when we carry out scientific difficulties down to the arena of popular dissension&quot;. In his view, it was necessary for the sake of social, economic and political stability &quot;to separate the serious, technical role of professionals from their responsibility [for] supplying usable philosophies for the general public&quot;. This expresses a dichotomy, derived from Plato, between public knowledge and private knowledge, &quot;civic culture&quot; and &quot;professional culture&quot;, the intellectual sphere of life and the life of ordinary people in society.

In the United States, members of the intellectual status class have been demographically characterized as people who hold liberal-to-leftist political perspectives about guns-or-butter fiscal policy.

In &quot;The Intellectuals and Socialism&quot; (1949), Friedrich Hayek wrote that &quot;journalists, teachers, ministers, lecturers, publicists, radio commentators, writers of fiction, cartoonists, and artists&quot; form an intellectual social class whose function is to communicate the complex and specialized knowledge of the scientist to the general public. He argued that intellectuals were attracted to socialism or social democracy because the socialists offered &quot;broad visions; the spacious comprehension of the social order, as a whole, which a planned system promises&quot; and that such broad-vision philosophies &quot;succeeded in inspiring the imagination of the intellectuals&quot; to change and improve their societies. According to Hayek, intellectuals disproportionately support socialism for idealistic and utopian reasons that cannot be realized in practice.

== Criticism ==
The French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre noted that &quot;the Intellectual is someone who meddles in what does not concern them&quot; ().

Noam Chomsky expressed the view that &quot;intellectuals are specialists in defamation, they are basically political commissars, they are the ideological administrators, the most threatened by dissidence.&quot; In his 1967 article &quot;The Responsibility of Intellectuals&quot;, Chomsky analyzes the intellectual culture in the U.S., and argues that it is largely subservient to power. He is particularly critical of social scientists and technocrats, who provide a pseudo-scientific justification for the crimes of the state.

In &quot;An Interview with Milton Friedman&quot; (1974), the American economist Milton Friedman said that businessmen and intellectuals are enemies of capitalism: most intellectuals believed in socialism while businessmen expected economic privileges. In his essay &quot;Why Do Intellectuals Oppose Capitalism?&quot; (1998), the American libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick of the Cato Institute argued that intellectuals become embittered leftists because their superior intellectual work, much rewarded at school and at university, are undervalued and underpaid in the capitalist market economy. Thus, intellectuals turn against capitalism despite enjoying more socioeconomic status than the average person.

The conservative economist Thomas Sowell wrote in his book &quot;Intellectuals and Society&quot; (2010) that intellectuals, who are producers of knowledge, not material goods, tend to speak outside their own areas of expertise, and yet expect social and professional benefits from the halo effect derived from possessing professional expertise. In relation to other professions, public intellectuals are socially detached from the negative and unintended consequences of public policy derived from their ideas. Sowell gives the example of Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), who advised the British government against national rearmament in the years before the Second World War.

<text>Leadership development is the process which helps expand the capacity of individuals to perform in leadership roles within organizations. Leadership roles are those that facilitate execution of an organization&#x27;s strategy through building alignment, winning mindshare and growing the capabilities of others. Leadership roles may be formal, with the corresponding authority to make decisions and take responsibility, or they may be informal roles with little official authority (e.g., a member of a team who influences team engagement, purpose and direction; a lateral peer who must listen and negotiate through influence).

== Developing individual leaders ==

Traditionally, leadership development has focused on developing the leadership abilities and attitudes of individuals.

Different personal trait and characteristics can help or hinder a person&#x27;s leadership effectiveness and require formalized programs for developing leadership competencies.

Classroom-style training and associated reading for leadership development may ail from the possible divergence between knowing what to do and doing what one knows; management expert Henry Mintzberg is one person to highlight this dilemma. A 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences estimated that as little as 15% of learning from traditional classroom-style training results in sustained behavioral change within workplaces.

Baldwin and Ford link success of leadership development efforts to three variables:

# Individual learner characteristics
# Quality and nature of the leadership development program
# Support for behavioral change from the leader&#x27;s supervisor.

Military officer-training academies, such as the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, go to great lengths to accept only candidates who show the highest potential to lead well. Personal characteristics that are associated with successful leadership development include leader motivation to learn, a high achievement drive and personality traits such as openness to experience, an internal focus of control, and self-monitoring. In order to develop individual leaders, supervisors or superiors must conduct an individual assessment.

Development is also more likely to occur when the design of the development program:

* Integrates a range of developmental experiences over a set period of time (e.g., 6–12 months). These experiences may include 360 degree feedback, experiential classroom style programs, business school style coursework, executive coaching, reflective journaling, mentoring and more.
* Involves goal-setting, following an assessment of key developmental needs and then an evaluation of the achievement of goals after a given time period.

Among key concepts in leadership development one may find:

* Experiential learning: Positioning the individual in the focus of the learning process, going through the four stages of experiential learning as formulated by David A. Kolb: 
*# Concrete experience. 
*# Observation and reflection. 
*# Forming abstract concepts. 
*# Testing in new situations.
* Self efficacy: The right training and coaching should bring about &#x27;self efficacy&#x27; in the trainee, as Albert Bandura formulated: a person&#x27;s belief about his capabilities to produce effects.
* Visioning: Developing the ability to formulate a clear image of the aspired future of an organization unit.
* Attitude: Attitude plays a major role in being a leader.

== Developing leadership at a collective level ==
Leadership can also be developed by strengthening the connection between, and alignment of, the efforts of individual leaders and the systems through which they influence organizational operations. This has led to a differentiation between leader development and leadership development.

Leadership development can build on the development of individuals (including followers) to become leaders. It also needs to focus on the interpersonal linkages in the team.

Following the credo of people as an organization&#x27;s most valuable resource, some organizations address the development of these resources (including leadership).

In contrast, the concept of &quot;employeeship&quot; recognizes that what it takes to be a good leader is not too dissimilar to what it takes to be a good employee. Therefore, bringing the notional leader together with the team to explore these similarities (rather than focusing on the differences) brings positive results. This approach has been particularly successful in Sweden where the power distance between manager and team is small.

== Succession planning ==

The development of &quot;high potentials&quot; to take over leadership when the time comes the current leadership to leave their positions is known as succession planning. This type of leadership development usually requires the extensive transfer of an individual between departments. In many multinationals, it usually requires international transfer and experience to build a future leader.

Succession planning requires a sharp focus on the organization&#x27;s future and vision, in order to align leadership development with the future that the organization aspires to create. Thus successive leadership development is based not only on knowledge and history but also on a dream. For such a plan to be successful, a screening of future leadership should be based not only on &quot;what we know and have&quot; but also on &quot;what we aspire to become&quot;.

Persons involved in succession planning should include current leadership members who can articulate the future vision. Three critical dimensions should be considered:

# Skills and knowledge; 
# Role perception and degree of acceptance of leading role; and, 
# Self-efficacy.

<doc id="227109" wikidata="Q631956" url="?curid=227109" title="Lamer">
<text>Lamer is a jargon or slang name originally applied in cracker and phreaker culture to someone who did not really understand what they were doing. Today it is also loosely applied by IRC, BBS, demosceners, and online gaming users to anyone perceived to be contemptible. In general, the term has come to describe someone who is willfully ignorant of how things work. It is derived from the word &quot;lame&quot;. 

A lamer is sometimes understood to be the antithesis of a hacker. While a hacker strives to understand the mechanisms behind what they use, even when such extended knowledge would have no practical value, a lamer only cares to learn the bare minimum necessary to operate the device in the way originally intended.

At least one example of the term &quot;lamer&quot; to mean &quot;a dull, stupid, inept, or contemptible person&quot; appeared as early as 1961. It was popularized among Amiga crackers of the mid-1980s by &quot;Lamer Exterminator&quot;, a notable Amiga virus, which gradually corrupted non-write-protected floppy disks with bad sectors. The bad sectors, when examined, were overwritten with repetitions of the string &quot;LAMER!&quot;.

In phreak culture, a lamer is one who scams codes from others and lacks understanding of the fundamental concepts. In warez culture, where the ability to distribute cracked commercial software within days of (or before) release to the commercial market is much esteemed, the lamer might try to upload garbage, shareware, or outdated releases.

<doc id="227111" wikidata="Q61078" url="?curid=227111" title="Walter Benjamin">
<text>Walter Bendix Schönflies Benjamin ( ; ; 15 July 1892 – 26 September 1940) was a German-Jewish philosopher, cultural critic, media theorist, and essayist. &quot;The medium is the message,&quot; is a famous formula with broad applications that was derived from Benjamin&#x27;s work by one of his readers. An eclectic thinker who combined elements of German idealism, Jewish mysticism, Western Marxism, and post-Kantianism. He made contributions to the philosophy of history, metaphysics, historical materialism, criticism, aesthetics and had an oblique but overwhelmingly influential impact on the resurrection of the Kabbalah by virtue of his life-long epistolary relationship with Gershom Scholem. 

Of the hidden principle organizing Walter Benjamin&#x27;s thought Scholem wrote unequivocally that &quot;Benjamin was a philosopher&quot;, while his younger colleagues Arendt and Adorno contend that he was &quot;not a philosopher&quot;. Scholem remarked &quot;The peculiar aura of authority emanating from his work tended to incite contradiction&quot;. Benjamin himself considered his research to be theological, though he eschewed all recourse to traditionally metaphysical sources of transcendentally revealed authority.

He was associated with the Frankfurt School and also maintained formative relationships with thinkers and cultural figures such as the cabaret playwright Bertolt Brecht (friend), Martin Buber (an early impresario in his career), Nazi constitutionalist Carl Schmitt (a rival), and many others. He was related to German political theorist and philosopher Hannah Arendt through her first marriage to Benjamin&#x27;s cousin Günther Anders, though the friendship between Arendt and Benjamin outlasted her marriage to Anders. Both Arendt and Anders were students of Martin Heidegger, whom Benjamin considered a nemesis.

Among Benjamin&#x27;s best known works are the essays &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; (1935), and &quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot; (1940). His major work as a critic included essays on Baudelaire, Goethe, Kafka, Kraus, Leskov, Proust, Walser, Trauerspiel and translation theory. He translated the &quot;Tableaux Parisiens&quot; section of Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; and parts of Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot;.

In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin died during his flight into exile on the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape the advance of the Third Reich. Having remained in Europe until it was too late, as Cynthia Ozick puts it, Benjamin took his own life to avoid being murdered as a Jew. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.

== Life ==
=== Early life and education ===
Walter Benjamin and his younger siblings, Georg (1895–1942) and Dora (1901–1946), were born to a wealthy business family of assimilated Ashkenazi Jews in Berlin, then the capital of the German Empire. Walter&#x27;s father, Emil Benjamin, was a banker in Paris who had relocated from France to Germany, where he worked as an antiques trader; he later married Pauline Schönflies. He owned a number of investments in Berlin, including ice skating rinks. 

Walter&#x27;s uncle, William Stern, was a prominent German child psychologist who developed the concept of the intelligence quotient (IQ). He also had a cousin, Günther Anders, a German philosopher and anti-nuclear activist who studied under Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Through his mother, Walter&#x27;s great-uncle was the classical archaeologist Gustav Hirschfeld.

In 1902, ten-year-old Walter was enrolled at the Kaiser Friedrich School in Charlottenburg; he completed his secondary school studies ten years later. In his youth, Walter was of fragile health and so in 1905 the family sent him to Hermann-Lietz-Schule Haubinda, a boarding school in the Thuringian countryside, for two years; in 1907, having returned to Berlin, he resumed his schooling at the Kaiser Friedrich School.

In 1912, at the age of 20, he enrolled at the University of Freiburg, but at the summer semester&#x27;s end, he returned to Berlin and matriculated at the University of Berlin to continue studying philosophy. There, Benjamin had his first exposure to Zionism, which had not been part of his liberal upbringing. This gave him occasion to formulate his own ideas about the meaning of Judaism. Benjamin distanced himself from political and nationalist Zionism, instead developing in his own thinking what he called a kind of &quot;cultural Zionism&quot;an attitude that recognized and promoted Judaism and Jewish values. In Benjamin&#x27;s formulation, his Jewishness meant a commitment to the furtherance of European culture. He wrote: &quot;My life experience led me to this insight: the Jews represent an elite in the ranks of the spiritually active ... For Judaism is to me in no sense an end in itself, but the most distinguished bearer and representative of the spiritual.&quot; This was a position Benjamin largely held lifelong.

It was as a speaker and debater in the milieu of the Gustav Wyneken&#x27;s German Youth Movement that Benjamin was first encountered by Gershom Scholem and later Martin Buber although he had parted ways with the youth group before they had become properly acquainted. Elected president of the &quot;Freie Studentenschaft&quot; (Free Students Association), Benjamin wrote essays arguing for educational and general cultural change while working alongside Wyneken at the legendary and controversial youth magazine &quot;Der Anfang&quot; (The beginning), that was banned in all schools in Bavaria. Wyneken&#x27;s thesis that a new youth must pave the way for revolutionary cultural change became the main theme of all of Benjamin&#x27;s publications at that time. When not reelected as student association president, he returned to Freiburg to study, with particular attention to the lectures of Heinrich Rickert; at that time he traveled to France and Italy.

Benjamin&#x27;s attempt to volunteer for service at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 was rejected by the army. Benjamin later feigned illnesses to avoid conscription, allowing him to continue his studies and his translations of works by French poet Charles Baudelaire. His conspicuous refuge in Switzerland on dubious medical grounds was a likely factor in his ongoing challenges in obtaining academic employment after the war.

The next year, 1915, Benjamin moved to Munich, and continued his schooling at the University of Munich, where he met Rainer Maria Rilke and Scholem; the latter became a friend. Intensive discussions with Scholem about Judaism and Jewish mysticism gave the impetus for the 1916 text (surviving as a manuscript) &quot;Über Sprache überhaupt und über die Sprache des Menschen&quot; (&quot;On Language as Such and on the Language of Man&quot;), which, as Benjamin said to Scholem , &quot;has an immanent relationship to Judaism and to the first chapter of the Genesis&quot;. In that period, Benjamin wrote about the 18th-century Romantic German poet Friedrich Hölderlin.

In 1917 Benjamin transferred to the University of Bern; there he met Ernst Bloch, and Dora Sophie Pollak (née Kellner), whom he married. They had a son, Stefan Rafael, in 1918. In 1919 Benjamin earned his PhD &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with the dissertation &quot;Der Begriff der Kunstkritik in der deutschen Romantik&quot; (&quot;The Concept of Art Criticism in German Romanticism&quot;).

For his postdoctoral thesis in 1920, Benjamin hit upon an idea very similar to the thesis proposed by Martin Heidegger in the latter&#x27;s own postdoctoral project (&quot;Duns Scotus: Theory of Categories and Meaning&quot;). Wolfram Eilenberger writes that Benjamin&#x27;s plan was &quot;to legitimize [his theory of language] with reference to a largely forgotten tradition [found in the archaic writings of Duns Scotus], and to strike the sparks of systematization from the apparent disjunct among modern, logical, and analytical linguistic philosophy and medieval speculations on language that fell under the heading of theology&quot;. After Scholem sympathetically informed his friend that his interest in the concept had been pre-empted by Heidegger&#x27;s earlier publication, Benjamin seemed to have derived a lifelong antagonism toward the rival philosopher whose major insights, over the course of both of their careers, sometimes overlapped and sometimes conflicted with Benjamin&#x27;s.

Later, unable to support himself and family, Benjamin returned to Berlin and resided with his parents. In 1921 he published the essay &quot;Zur Kritik der Gewalt&quot; (&quot;Toward the Critique of Violence&quot;). At this time Benjamin first became socially acquainted with Leo Strauss, and he remained an admirer of Strauss and his work throughout his life.

=== Friendships ===
Starting in adolescence, in a trend of episodic behavior that was to remain true throughout his life, Benjamin was a maven within an important community during a critically important historical period: the left-intelligentsia of interwar Berlin and Paris. Acquaintance with Walter Benjamin was a connecting thread for a variety of major figures in metaphysics, philosophy, theology, the visual arts, theater, literature, radio, politics and various other domains. Benjamin happened to be present on the outskirts of many of the most important events within the intellectual ferment of the interwar-period in Weimar Germany and interpreted those events in his writing.

He was in the crowd at the conference where Kurt Gödel first described the incompleteness theorem. He once took a class on the Ancient Mayans from Rilke. He attended the same seminar as Heidegger at Freiburg in the summer of 1913 when both men were still university students: concepts first encountered there influenced their thought for the remainder of their careers. He was an early draft script reader, comrade, favorable critic and promoter as well as a frequent house-guest of the Berlin cabaret theater scene writer and director Bertolt Brecht. Martin Buber took an interest in Benjamin, but Benjamin declined to contribute to Buber&#x27;s journal because it was too exoteric. Nevertheless, Buber financed Benjamin&#x27;s trip to Moscow and promoted his career in other ways. Nominally, Buber had commissioned Benjamin to write an article Moscow for his &quot;Die Kreatur,&quot; though Benjamin blew his deadline for the delivery of this piece by several years. 

Benjamin was a close colleague of Ernst Bloch while Bloch was writing the &quot;Spirit of Utopia&quot; and maintained a relationship with him until the late 20&#x27;s that Bloch later described as &quot;almost too close.&quot; An untitled scrap omitted from Benjamin&#x27;s book review of Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of Utopia&quot; which remained unpublished during Benjamin&#x27;s lifetime (later anthologized under the title &quot;Theologico-Political Fragment&quot;) is now perhaps better remembered than the larger work it cites as an authority for its mystical reflections. It was Bloch&#x27;s commission that inspired Benjamin&#x27;s work on the theory of categories, according to Scholem. This was to be a consequential theme throughout his career.

One of Benjamin&#x27;s high-school best friends (also a German Jew) killed himself using gas at the outbreak of the first World War; another was one of the Jewish Liaisons who took Nazi diplomats on a tour of Palestine. This happened while the Third Reich was preparing the European Zionists to believe that Europe&#x27;s Jews would be forcibly emigrated from the Reich, to deflect attention from the looming possibility of the strategy that was ultimately adopted: mass extermination in the death camps. Scholem, Benjamin&#x27;s oldest friend, and the sole executor of his literary estate, would resurrect the canonical books of the Kabbalah from private libraries and ancient document dumps called Genizah. These were created when the books flooded into Mandatory Palestine during the period leading up to, coinciding with, and immediately following the Holocaust.

=== Career ===
In 1923, when the Institute for Social Research was founded, later to become home to the Frankfurt School, Benjamin published &quot;Charles Baudelaire, Tableaux Parisiens&quot;. At this time he became acquainted with Theodor Adorno and befriended Georg Lukács, whose &quot;The Theory of the Novel&quot; (1920) influenced him. Meanwhile, inflation in the Weimar Republic after the war made it difficult for Emil Benjamin to continue supporting his son&#x27;s family. At the end of 1923 Scholem emigrated to Palestine, then under a British mandate; despite repeated invitations, he failed to persuade Benjamin (and family) to leave the continent for the Middle East.

In 1924 Hugo von Hofmannsthal, in the &quot;Neue Deutsche Beiträge&quot; magazine, published Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften&quot; (&quot;Goethe&#x27;s Elective Affinities&quot;), about Goethe&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Die Wahlverwandtschaften&quot; (1809). According to literary critic Burkhardt Lindner, the essay forms the &quot;third major philosophical-aesthetic treatise of the early work&quot; alongside the PhD dissertation and the habilitation thesis. It has often been linked to the breakup of his marriage. The dedication to Julia Cohn, whom he had courted in vain at the time, suggests this.

Likewise, according to Hannah Arendt, it was his essay on Goethe that ruined Benjamin&#x27;s only chance of a university career. Benjamin&#x27;s Goethe monograph is partly a meditation on the form &#x27;free-love&#x27; that the Benjamins were experimenting with in their marriage at this time, amongst other things. But this was only tangential to the issue that led to the controversy to which Arendt refers. His mistake (per Arendt) was killing a sacred cow from amongst the academic establishment. As so often in Benjamin&#x27;s writings, his study of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Elective Affinities&quot; was marked by polemics and the theme of his assault in this work concerned Friedrich Gundolf&#x27;s Goethe book. Gundolf was the most prominent and able academic member of the (Stefan) George-Kreis--a cult of post-symbolist, romantic nationalist poets with a mystically conservative, medievalist bent. Elsewhere, in the anonymity of his private epistolary writings, Benjamin explicitly points out how (regardless of the ultimate horror, withdrawal and rejection with which members of the circle greeted the Nazi regime) this group&#x27;s commitment to particular archaic styles anticipated the aesthetics of fascism.

Later that year Benjamin and Bloch resided on the Italian island of Capri; Benjamin wrote &quot;Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels&quot; (&quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot;) as a habilitation thesis meant to qualify him as a tenured university professor in Germany.

At Bloch&#x27;s suggestion, he read Lukács&#x27;s &quot;History and Class Consciousness&quot; (1923). He also met the Latvian Bolshevik and actress Asja Lācis, then residing in Moscow; he became her lover and she was a lasting intellectual influence on him.

A year later, in 1925, Benjamin withdrew &quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot; as his possible qualification for the habilitation teaching credential at the University of Frankfurt at Frankfurt am Main, fearing its possible rejection. The work was a study in which he sought to &quot;save&quot; the category of allegory. It proved too unorthodox and abstruse for its examiners, who included prominent members of the humanities faculty, such as Hans Cornelius. Max Horkheimer also sat on the panel of examiners who rejected Benjamin&#x27;s thesis. Horkheimer later serves as both patron and promoter of Benjamin&#x27;s work at the Institute for Social Research and is best remembered as the co-author of Benjamin&#x27;s closest disciple Theodor Adorno&#x27;s magnum opus, the &quot;Dialectic of the Enlightenment&quot; (a book which cribs heavily from Benjamin&#x27;s unpublished, esoteric writings in many of its most important passages). In the case of Benjamin&#x27;s habilitation, however, Horkheimer presents a united front with Cornelius and Professor Schultz in asking Benjamin to withdraw his application for the habilitation to avoid disgrace on the occasion of the examination. That is to say: His committee informed him that he will not be accepted as an academic instructor in the German university system. 

A diagram of the internecine dynamics of Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;habilitation&quot; committee&#x27;s rejection of his work bear recollection here, as they determine something of the character of his later career and ultimate legacy. Hans Cornelius had been Adorno&#x27;s mentor in the institutional context of the university, whereas once Adorno started actually teaching as a professor at the University of Frankfurt, he devoted his seminars to Benjamin&#x27;s rejected work. Adorno&#x27;s 1931 and 1932 seminars, delivered at Frankfurt University, devoted themselves to a close reading of the &quot;Origins of German Tragic Drama&quot;. Adorno was still teaching this class on the &quot;Origins of German Tragic Drama&quot; during the winter semester that Adolph Hitler came to power, although at that time it was not listed in the course catalog--whereas Adorno&#x27;s academic mentor Cornelius, who had rejected this thesis, is today remembered primarily because of his rejection of Benjamin&#x27;s habilitation. Horkheimer becomes a footnote to the career of Benjamin&#x27;s apprentice. Schultz--the other member of Benjamin&#x27;s committee who seems to have directed him to the subject of Baroque drama in the first place, only to reject the thesis that derived from this recommendation--is virtually altogether forgotten. The episode in the history of the German academy is immortalized in the &quot;bon mot&quot;, &quot;One cannot habilitate intellect.&quot;

This failure resulted in his father&#x27;s refusal to continue to support him financially, so that Benjamin was forced to make ends meet as a professional critic and occasional translator. Working with Franz Hessel he translated the first volumes of Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la Recherche du Temps Perdu&quot; (&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;). The next year, 1926, he began writing for the German newspapers &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Die Literarische Welt&quot; (The Literary World); that paid enough for him to reside in Paris for some months. In December 1926, the year his father died, Benjamin went to Moscow to meet Lācis and found her ill in a sanatorium.

During his stay in Moscow, he was asked by the editorial board of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia to write an article on Goethe for the first edition of the encyclopedia. Benjamin&#x27;s article was ultimately rejected, with reviewer Anatoly Lunacharsky (then the People&#x27;s Commissar of Education) characterizing it as &quot;non-encyclopedic&quot;, and only a small part of the text prepared by Benjamin was included in the encyclopedia. During Benjamin&#x27;s lifetime, the article was not published in its entirety. A Russian translation of the article was published in the Russian edition of &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; in 1996.

In 1927, he began &quot;Das Passagen-Werk&quot; (&quot;The Arcades Project&quot;), his uncompleted &quot;magnum opus&quot;, a study of 19th-century Parisian life. The same year, he saw Scholem in Berlin, for the last time, and considered emigrating from Germany to Palestine. In 1928, he and Dora separated (they divorced two years later, in 1930); in the same year he published &quot;Einbahnstraße&quot; (&quot;One-Way Street&quot;), and a revision of his habilitation thesis &quot;Ursprung des Deutschen Trauerspiels&quot; (&quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot;). In 1929 Berlin, Lācis, then an assistant to Bertolt Brecht, socially presented the intellectuals to each other. In that time, Benjamin also briefly embarked upon an academic career, as an instructor at the University of Heidelberg.

=== Exile and death ===

In 1932, during the turmoil preceding Adolf Hitler&#x27;s assumption of the office of Chancellor of Germany, Benjamin left Germany temporarily for the Spanish island of Ibiza where he stayed for some months; he then moved to Nice, where he considered killing himself. Perceiving the sociopolitical and cultural significance of the Reichstag fire (27 February 1933) as the &quot;de facto&quot; Nazi assumption of full power in Germany, then manifest with the subsequent persecution of the Jews, he left Berlin and Germany for good in September. He moved to Paris, but before doing so he sought shelter in Svendborg, at Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s house, and at Sanremo, where his ex-wife Dora lived.

As he ran out of money, Benjamin collaborated with Max Horkheimer, and received funds from the Institute for Social Research, later going permanently into exile. In Paris, he met other refugee German artists and intellectuals; he befriended Hannah Arendt, novelist Hermann Hesse, and composer Kurt Weill. In 1936, a first version of &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; (originally written in German in 1935) was published in French (&quot;L&#x27;œuvre d&#x27;art à l&#x27;époque de sa reproduction méchanisée&quot;) by Max Horkheimer in the &quot;Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung&quot; journal of the Institute for Social Research. It was a critique of the authenticity of mass-produced art; he wrote that a mechanically produced copy of an artwork can be taken somewhere the original could never have gone, arguing that the presence of the original is &quot;prerequisite to the concept of authenticity&quot;. In 1937 Benjamin worked on &quot;Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire&quot; (&quot;The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire&quot;), met Georges Bataille (to whom he later entrusted the &quot;Arcades Project&quot; manuscript), and joined the College of Sociology (which he would criticize for its &quot;pre-fascist aestheticism.&quot;) In 1938 he paid a last visit to Brecht, who was exiled to Denmark. Meanwhile, the Nazi régime stripped German Jews of their German citizenship; now a stateless man, Benjamin was arrested by the French government and incarcerated for three months in a prison camp near Nevers, in central Burgundy.

Returning to Paris in January 1940, he drafted &quot;Über den Begriff der Geschichte&quot; (&quot;On the Concept of History&quot;, later published as &quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot;). While the Wehrmacht was pushing back the French Army, on 13 June Benjamin and his sister fled Paris to the town of Lourdes, just a day before the Germans entered the capital with orders to arrest him at his flat. In August, he obtained a travel visa to the U.S. that Horkheimer had negotiated for him. In eluding the Gestapo, Benjamin planned to travel to the U.S. from neutral Portugal, which he expected to reach via Francoist Spain, then ostensibly a neutral country.

The historical record indicates that he safely crossed the French–Spanish border and arrived at the coastal town of Portbou, in Catalonia on 25 September 1940. The Franco government had cancelled all transit visas and ordered the Spanish police to return such persons to France, including the Jewish refugee group Benjamin had joined. They were told by the Spanish police that they would be deported back to France the next day, which would have thwarted Benjamin&#x27;s plans to travel to the United States. Expecting repatriation to Nazi hands, Benjamin killed himself with an overdose of morphine tablets that night, while staying at the &quot;Hotel de Francia&quot;; the official Portbou register records 26 September 1940 as the date of death. Benjamin&#x27;s colleague Arthur Koestler, also fleeing Europe, attempted suicide by taking some of the morphine tablets, but survived. Benjamin&#x27;s brother Georg was killed at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in 1942.

The others in his party were allowed passage the next day (maybe because Benjamin&#x27;s suicide shocked Spanish officials), and safely reached Lisbon on 30 September. Arendt, who crossed the French-Spanish border at Portbou a few months later, passed the manuscript of &quot;Theses&quot; to Adorno. Another completed manuscript, which Benjamin had carried in his suitcase, disappeared after his death and has not been recovered.

== Thought ==

In addition to his lifelong dialogue in letters with Gershom Scholem, Walter Benjamin maintained an intense correspondence with Theodor Adorno and Bertolt Brecht, and was occasionally funded by the Frankfurt School under the direction of Adorno and Horkheimer, even from their New York City residence. At other times he received funding from Hebrew University or from funds made available by Martin Buber and his publishing associates including Salman Schocken.

The dynamism or conflict between these competing influences—Brecht&#x27;s Marxism, Adorno&#x27;s critical theory, Scholem&#x27;s Jewish mysticism—were central to his work, although their philosophic differences remained unresolved. Moreover, the critic Paul de Man argued that the intellectual range of Benjamin&#x27;s writings flows dynamically among those three intellectual traditions, deriving a critique via juxtaposition; the exemplary synthesis is &quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot;. At least one scholar, historian of religion Jason Josephson-Storm, has argued that Benjamin&#x27;s diverse interests may be understood in part by understanding the influence of Western Esotericism on Benjamin. Some of Benjamin&#x27;s key ideas were adapted from occultists and New Age figures including Eric Gutkind and Ludwig Klages, and his interest in esotericism is known to have extended far beyond the Jewish Kabbalah. In addition to Brecht&#x27;s Marxism, Adorno&#x27;s critical theory, and Scholem&#x27;s Jewish mysticism, Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings have underscored the importance of Karl Korsch&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Capital&quot; to understanding Benjamin&#x27;s engagement with Marxism in later works like the &quot;Arcades&quot;. Karl Korsch&#x27;s &quot;Karl Marx&quot;, which was &quot;one of Benjamin&#x27;s main sources [on]... Marxism,&quot; introduced him &quot;to an advanced understanding of Marxism.&quot;

=== &quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot; ===

&quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot; is often cited as Benjamin&#x27;s last complete work, having been completed, according to Adorno, in the spring of 1940. The Institute for Social Research, which had relocated to New York, published &quot;Theses&quot; in Benjamin&#x27;s memory in 1942. Margaret Cohen writes in the &quot;Cambridge Companion to Walter Benjamin&quot;:

In the essay, Benjamin&#x27;s famed ninth thesis struggles to reconcile the Idea of Progress in the present with the apparent chaos of the past:

The final paragraph about the Jewish quest for the Messiah provides a final point to Benjamin&#x27;s work, with its themes of culture, destruction, Jewish heritage and the fight between humanity and nihilism. He brings up the interdiction, in some varieties of Judaism, of attempts to determine the year when the Messiah would come into the world, and points out that this did not make Jews indifferent to the future &quot;for every second of time was the strait gate through which the Messiah might enter&quot;.

=== &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; ===
Perhaps Walter Benjamin&#x27;s best-known essay, &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,&quot; identifies the perceptual shift that takes place when technological advancements emphasize speed and reproducibility. Benjamin argues that the aura is found in a work of art that contains presence. The aura is precisely what cannot be reproduced in a work of art: its original presence in time and space. He suggests a work of art&#x27;s aura is in a state of decay because it is becoming more and more difficult to apprehend the time and space in which a piece of art is created.

This essay also introduces the concept of the optical unconscious, a concept that identifies the subject&#x27;s ability to identify desire in visual objects. This also leads to the ability to perceive information by habit instead of rapt attention.

=== &quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot; ===
&quot;Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels&quot; (&quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot;, 1928), is a critical study of German baroque drama, as well as the political and cultural climate of Germany during the Counter-Reformation (1545–1648). Benjamin presented the work to the University of Frankfurt in 1925 as the postdoctoral dissertation meant to earn him the habilitation (qualification) to become a university instructor in Germany.

Professor Schultz of the University of Frankfurt found &quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot; inappropriate for his &quot;Germanistik&quot; department (Department of German Language and Literature), and passed it to the Department of Aesthetics, the readers of which likewise dismissed Benjamin&#x27;s work. The university officials recommended that Benjamin withdraw &quot;Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels&quot; as a habilitation thesis to avoid formal rejection and public embarrassment. He heeded the advice, and three years later, in 1928, he published &quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot; as a book.

=== &quot;One Way Street&quot; ===
&quot;Einbahnstraße&quot; (&quot;One Way Street&quot;, 1928) is a series of meditations written primarily during the same phase as &quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot;, after Benjamin had met Asja Lācis on the beach at Capri in 1924. He finished the cycle in 1926, and put it out the same year that his failed thesis was published.

&quot;One Way Street&quot; is a collage work. Greil Marcus compares certain formal qualities of the book to the graphic novel &quot;Hundred Headless Women&quot; by Max Ernst, or to Walter Ruttman&#x27;s &quot;The Weekend&quot; (an early sound collage film)&quot;.&quot; The book avoids &quot;all semblance of linear-narrative...[offering] a jumble of sixty apparently autonomous short prose pieces: aphorisms, jokes, dream protocols, cityscapes, landscapes, and mindscapes; portions of writing manuals, trenchant contemporary political analysis; prescient appreciations of the child&#x27;s psychology, behavior, and moods; decodings of bourgeois fashion, living arrangements and courtship patterns; and time and again, remarkable penetrations into the heart of every day things, what Benjamin would later call a mode of empathy with &#x27;the soul of the commodity&#x27;&quot; according to Michael Jennings in his introduction to the work. He continues: &quot;Many of the pieces...first appeared in the feuilleton section,&quot; of newspapers and magazines which was &quot;not a separate section but rather an area at the bottom of every page...and the spatial restrictions of the feuilleton played a decisive role in shaping the prose form on which the book is based.&quot;

Written contemporaneously with Martin Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Being &amp; Time&quot;, Benjamin&#x27;s work from this period explores much of the same territory: formally in his &quot;Epistemo-Critical Prologue&quot; to &quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot;, and as sketches, allusions and asides in &quot;One Way Street.&quot;

=== &quot;The Arcades Project&quot; ===

The &quot;Passagenwerk&quot; (&quot;Arcades Project&quot;, 1927–40) was Benjamin&#x27;s final, incomplete book about Parisian city life in the 19th century, especially about the &quot;Passages couverts de Paris&quot;—the covered passages that extended the culture of &quot;flânerie&quot; (idling and people-watching) when inclement weather made &quot;flânerie&quot; infeasible in the boulevards and streets proper. In this work Benjamin uses his fragmentary style to write about the rise of modern European urban culture. Several of the major published works that appeared in his lifetime—&quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot;, &quot;Paris, The Capital of the 19th Century&quot;, and his late essays and monograph on Baudelaire—are fragments of the book that he developed as standalone pieces for publication.

The &quot;Arcades Project&quot;, in its current form, brings together a massive collection of notes Benjamin filed together from 1927 to 1940.

The &quot;Arcades Project&quot; was published for the first time in 1982, and is over a thousand pages long.

=== Writing style ===
Scholem said of Benjamin&#x27;s prose: &quot;Among the peculiarities of Benjamin&#x27;s philosophical prose—the critical and metaphysical prose, in which the Marxist element constitutes something like an inversion of the metaphysical-theological—is its enormous suitability for canonization; I might almost say for quotation as a kind of Holy Writ.&quot; Scholem&#x27;s commentary on this phenomenon continues at length. Briefly: Benjamin&#x27;s texts have an occult quality in the sense that passages appearing quite lucid today may seem impenetrable later, and elements that read as indecipherable or incoherent now may read as transparently obvious upon later revisitation.

Susan Sontag said that in Benjamin&#x27;s writing, sentences did not originate ordinarily, do not progress into one another, and delineate no obvious line of reasoning, as if each sentence &quot;had to say everything, before the inward gaze of total concentration dissolved the subject before his eyes&quot;, a &quot;freeze-frame baroque&quot; style of writing and cogitation. &quot;His major essays seem to end just in time, before they self-destruct&quot;. The occasional difficulties of Benjamin&#x27;s style are essential to his philosophical project. Fascinated by notions of reference and constellation, his goal in later works was to use intertexts to reveal aspects of the past that cannot, and should not, be understood within greater, monolithic constructs of historical understanding.

Benjamin&#x27;s writings identify him as a modernist for whom the philosophic merges with the literary: logical philosophic reasoning cannot account for all experience, especially not for self-representation via art. He presented his stylistic concerns in &quot;The Task of the Translator&quot;, wherein he posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational modification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth.

His work &quot;The Task of the Translator&quot; was later commented by the French translation scholar Antoine Berman (&quot;L&#x27;âge de la traduction&quot;).

== Legacy and reception ==
Since the publication of &quot;Schriften&quot; (&quot;Writings&quot;, 1955), 15 years after his death, Benjamin&#x27;s work—especially the essay &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; (French edition, 1936)—has become of seminal importance to academics in the humanities disciplines. In 1968, the first Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft was established by the German thinker, poet and artist Natias Neutert, as a free association of philosophers, writers, artists, media theoreticians and editors. They did not take Benjamin&#x27;s body of thought as a scholastic &quot;closed architecture [...], but as one in which all doors, windows and roof hatches are widely open&quot;, as the founder Neutert put it—more poetically than politically—in his manifesto. The members felt liberated to take Benjamin&#x27;s ideas as a welcome touchstone for social change.

Like the first Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft, a new one, established in 2000, researches and discusses the imperative that Benjamin formulated in his &quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot;: &quot;In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest the tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it.&quot; The successor society was registered in Karlsruhe (Germany); Chairman of the Board of Directors was Bernd Witte, an internationally recognized Benjamin scholar and Professor of Modern German Literature in Düsseldorf (Germany). Its members come from 19 countries, both within and beyond Europe and it provides an international forum for discourse. The Society supported research endeavors devoted to the creative and visionary potential of Benjamin&#x27;s works and their view of 20th century modernism. Special emphasis had been placed upon strengthening academic ties to Latin America and Eastern and Central Europe.
The society conducts conferences and exhibitions, as well as interdisciplinary and intermedial events, at regular intervals and different European venues:
* Barcelona Conference – September 2000
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Berlin – November 2001
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Karlsruhe – January 2003
* Rome Conference – November 2003
* Zurich Conference – October 2004
* Paris Conference – June 2005
* Düsseldorf Conference – June 2005
* Düsseldorf Conference – November 2005
* Antwerpen Conference – May 2006
* Vienna Conference – March 2007

In 2017 Walter Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Arcades Project&quot; was reinterpreted in an exhibition curated by Jens Hoffman, held at the Jewish Museum in New York City. The exhibition, entitled &quot;The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin&quot;, featured 36 contemporary artworks representing the 36 convolutes of Benjamin&#x27;s Project.

In 2022, , a modern Russian philosopher, specialist in media studies and translator of Benjamin&#x27;s works into Russian, created the Russian-language Telegram channel &quot;Radio Benjamin&quot;.

Benjamin is portrayed by Moritz Bleibtreu in the 2023 Netflix series Transatlantic.

== Commemoration ==

A commemorative plaque is located by the residence where Benjamin lived in Berlin during the years 1930–1933: (Prinzregentenstraße 66, Berlin-Wilmersdorf). A commemorative plaque is located in Paris (10 rue Dombasle, 15th) where Benjamin lived in 1938–1940.

Close by Kurfürstendamm, in the district of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, a town square created by Hans Kollhoff in 2001 was named &quot;Walter-Benjamin-Platz&quot;. There is a memorial sculpture by the artist Dani Karavan at Portbou, where Walter Benjamin ended his life. It was commissioned to mark 50 years since his death.

<text>Mentorship is the patronage, influence, guidance, or direction given by a mentor. A mentor is someone who teaches or gives help and advice to a less experienced and often younger person. In an organizational setting, a mentor influences the personal and professional growth of a mentee. Most traditional mentorships involve having senior employees mentor more junior employees, but mentors do not necessarily have to be more senior than the people they mentor. What matters is that mentors have experience that others can learn from.

According to the Business Dictionary, a mentor is a senior or more experienced person who is assigned to function as an advisor, counsellor, or guide to a junior or trainee. The mentor is responsible for offering help and feedback to the person under their supervision. A mentor&#x27;s role, according to this definition, is to use their experience to help a junior employee by supporting them in their work and career, providing comments on their work, and, most crucially, offering direction to mentees as they work through problems and circumstances at work.

Interaction with an expert may also be necessary to gain proficiency with cultural tools. Mentorship experience and relationship structure affect the &quot;amount of psychosocial support, career guidance, role modeling and communication that occurs in the mentoring relationships in which the protégés and mentors engaged&quot;.

The person receiving mentorship may be referred to as a &quot;protégé&quot; (male), a &quot;protégée&quot; (female), an apprentice, a learner or, in the 2000s, a mentee. Mentoring is a process that always involves communication and is relationship-based, but its precise definition is elusive, with more than 50 definitions currently in use, such as:

Mentoring in Europe has existed as early as Ancient Greek. The word&#x27;s origin comes from Mentor, son of Alcimus in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Since the 1970s it has spread in the United States mainly in training contexts, associated with important historical links to the movement advancing workplace equity for women and minorities and has been described as &quot;an innovation in American management&quot;.
==History==

The word was inspired by the character Mentor in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Although the Mentor in the story is portrayed as a somewhat ineffective old man, the goddess Athena assumes his appearance to guide young Telemachus in his time of difficulty.

Historically significant systems of mentorship include the guru–disciple tradition practiced in Hinduism and Buddhism, Elders, the discipleship system practiced by Rabbinical Judaism and the Christian church and apprenticeship under the medieval guild system.

In the United States, advocates for workplace equity in the second half of the twentieth century popularized the term &quot;mentor&quot; and the concept of career mentorship as part of a larger social capital lexicon that also includes terms such as glass ceiling, bamboo ceiling, networking, role model and gatekeeper, which serves to identify and address the problems barring non-dominant groups from professional success. Mainstream business literature has adopted the terms and concepts and promoted them as pathways to success for all career climbers. These terms were not in the general American vocabulary until the mid-1990s.

== Professional bodies and qualifications ==
The European Mentoring and Coaching Council (EMCC) is the leading global body in terms of creating and maintaining a range of industry-standard frameworks, rules and processes for mentorship and related supervision and coaching fields.

== Techniques ==
As the focus of mentorship is to develop the whole person, the techniques used are broad and require wisdom to be appropriately used. A 1995 study of mentoring techniques most commonly used in business found that the five most commonly used techniques among mentors were:

# Accompanying&quot;:&quot; the mentor participates in the learning process alongside the learner and supports them.
# Sowing&quot;:&quot; the mentor gives initially unclear or unacceptable advice to the learner that has value in a given situation.
# Catalyzing&quot;:&quot; the mentor chooses to plunge the learner right into change to provoke a different way of thinking, a change in identity or a re-ordering of values.
# Showing&quot;:&quot; the mentor teaches the learner by demonstrating a skill or activity.
# Harvesting&quot;:&quot; the mentor assesses and defines the utility and value of the learner&#x27;s skills.

Different techniques may be used by mentors according to the situation and the mindset of the mentee. The techniques used in modern organizations can be found in ancient education systems, from the Socratic technique of harvesting to the accompaniment used in the apprenticeship of itinerant cathedral builders during the Middle Ages. Leadership authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner advise mentors to look for &quot;teachable moments&quot; in order to &quot;expand or realize the potentialities of the people in the organizations they lead&quot; and underline that personal credibility is as essential to quality mentoring as skill.

There are different types of mentors, such as:
* Multiple mentors: A new trend is for a learner to have multiple mentors. Having more than one mentor can expand the learner&#x27;s knowledge, as different mentors may have different strengths.
* Profession or trade mentor: This is someone who is currently in the trade or profession the learner is entering. They know the trends, important changes, and new practices that newcomers should know to stay at the top of their careers. A mentor like this would be someone a learner can discuss ideas with and also provides the learner with the opportunity to network with other individuals in the trade or profession.
* Industry mentor: This is someone who does not only focus on the profession and can give insight into the industry as a whole, such as research, development, or key changes.
* Organization mentor: Politics in organizations are constantly changing. It is important to be knowledgeable about the values, strategies, and products that are within the organisation, and when they change. An organization mentor can give clarity when needed, for example, on missions and strategies.
* Work process mentor: This mentor can cut through unnecessary work, explain the &quot;ins and outs&quot; of projects and day-to-day tasks, and eliminate unnecessary things in the learner&#x27;s workday. This mentor can help finish tasks quickly and efficiently.
* Technology mentor: Technology has been rapidly improving and becoming more a part of day-to-day transactions within companies. A technology mentor can help with technical breakdowns, advise on systems that may work better than what the learner is currently using, and coach them in using new technology.

==Types of mentoring==
=== Formal mentoring ===
Formal mentoring relationships are set up by an administrative unit or office in a company or organization, which solicits and recruits qualified individuals who are willing to mentor, provides training to the mentors, and helps to match the mentors with a person in need of mentoring. While formal mentoring systems contain numerous structural and guidance elements, they usually allow the mentor and mentee to have an active role in choosing who they want to work with. Formal mentoring programs that simply assign mentors to mentees without allowing input from these individuals have not performed well. Even though a mentor and a mentee may seem perfectly matched &quot;on paper&quot;, in practice, they may have different working or learning styles. As such, giving the mentor and the mentee the opportunity to help select who they want to work with is a widely used approach. For example, youth mentoring programs assign at-risk children or youth who lack role models and sponsors to mentors who act as role models and sponsors.

In business, formal mentoring is one of many talent management strategies that are used to groom key employees, newly hired graduates, high-potential employees, and future leaders. Matching mentors and mentees is often done by a mentoring coordinator with the help of a computerized database registry, which usually suggests matches based on the type of experience and qualifications being sought.

There are formal mentoring programs that are values-oriented, while social mentoring and other types focus specifically on career development. Some mentorship programs provide both social and vocational support. In well-designed formal mentoring programs, there are program goals, schedules, training (for both mentors and protégés), and evaluation.

=== Informal mentoring ===
Informal mentoring occurs without the use of structured recruitment, mentor training and matching services. It can develop naturally between partners, such as business networking situations where a more experienced individual meets a new employee and the two build a rapport. Apart from these types, mentoring takes a dyadic structure in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM).

=== Models ===
There are many kinds of mentoring relationships from school or community-based relationships to e-mentoring relationships. These mentoring relationships vary and can be influenced by the type of mentoring relationship. There are several models that have been used to describe and examine the sub-relationships that can emerge: for example, Cindy Buell describes how mentoring relationships can develop:

* Cloning model: The mentor teaches the learner as if they were a clone of the mentor.
* Nurturing model: The mentor assumes a parental role to create an open, supportive environment where the learner can learn and try things themselves. 
* Friendship model: The mentor acts more as a peer &quot;rather than being involved in a hierarchical relationship&quot;.
* Apprenticeship model: The mentor and learner predominantly have a professional relationship.

=== Other types ===

* Peer mentoring: Relationships that involve individuals in similar positions. One person may be more knowledgeable in a certain aspect or another, and they can help each other progress in their work. In most cases, peer relationships provide a lot of support, empathy, and advice because the situations are quite similar.
* Situational mentoring: Short-term relationships in which a person mentors for a specific purpose. This could be a company bringing an expert in regarding social media, or internet safety. This expert can mentor employees to make them more knowledgeable about a specific topic or skill.
* Supervisory mentoring: This relationship involves a mentor with a higher position than the learner. The mentor can answer many questions and advise the best course of action.
* Mentoring circles: Participants from all levels of the organization propose and own a topic before meeting in groups to discuss the topic, which motivates them to grow and become more knowledgeable. Flash mentoring is ideal for situations like job shadowing and reverse mentoring.

==Benefits==
A meta-analysis of 112 individual research studies found mentoring has significant behavioral, attitudinal, health-related, relational, motivational, and career benefits. For a learner, these benefits depend on the different functions being performed by the mentor. Originally, the concept of mentoring functions developed from qualitative research in an organizational context with functions that belong under two major factors: psychosocial support (e.g. role modeling, friendship, emotional support, encouragement) and career-related support (e.g. providing advice, discussing goals). An early quantitative approach found role modeling to be a distinct third factor. In mentoring for college success, a fourth function concerning knowledge transfer was additionally identified, which was also discovered in the context of mentoring creativity.

There are also many benefits for an employer to develop a mentorship program for new and current employees:

* Career development: Setting up a career development mentoring program for employees enables an organization to help junior employees to learn the skills and behaviours from senior employees that the junior employees need to advance to higher-responsibility positions. This type of mentoring program can help to align organizational goals with employees&#x27; personal career goals of progressing within the organization. It gives employees the ability to advance professionally and learn more about their work. This collaboration also gives employees a feeling of engagement with the organization, which can lead to better retention rates and increased employee satisfaction.
* High potential mentoring: The most talented employees in organizations tend to be difficult to retain as they usually seek greater challenges and responsibilities and are likely to leave for a different organization if they do not feel that they are being given the opportunity to develop. Creating a mentoring program for high-potential employees that gives them one-on-one guidance from senior leaders can help engage employees, give them the opportunity to develop, and increase the likelihood of staying in the organization.
* Diversity mentoring: One of the top ways to innovate is by bringing in new ideas from senior employees and leaders from underrepresented groups (e.g., women, ethnic minorities, etc.). In many Western countries, women and ethnic minorities are significantly underrepresented in executive positions and boards of directors. However, in some traditionally gender-segregated occupations, such as education and nursing, women may be the dominant gender in the workforce. Mentors from underrepresented groups can empower employees from similar groups to increase their confidence to accept higher-responsibility tasks and prepare for leadership roles. Developing employees from diverse groups can give the organization access to new ideas, problem-solving approaches, and perspectives. These relationships tend to lead to success within the organization and increased job satisfaction. Majority mentors are given the opportunity to learn about and empathize with the culture and experiences of the minority learning, but the mentoring relationship can be impeded if they are unwilling to adapt their cultural views. Members of the majority culture are perceived as more competent while members of the minority culture receive less credit for the same amount of work; therefore, a majority mentor, by virtue of their status, can assist a minority learner in receiving the recognition and job advancement they deserve. Minority mentors often feel pressure to work harder than other mentors to prove their worth within an organization. However, when paired with majority learners, their perceived worth automatically increases due solely to the majority status of their peers. Minority mentors tend to impart emotional benefits to their learners. In a 1958 study, Margaret Cussler showed that for each female executive she interviewed who did not own her own company, &quot;something—or someone—gave her a push up the ladder while others halted on a lower rung.&quot; Cussler concluded that the relationship between the &quot;sponsor and protégé&quot; (the vocabulary of &quot;mentorship&quot; was not yet in common use) was the &quot;magic formula&quot; for success. By the late 1970s, numerous publications had established the centrality of mentorship to business success for everyone and particularly for women trying to enter the male-dominated business world. These publications noted the many benefits provided by mentorship, which included insider information, education, guidance, moral support, inspiration, sponsorship, protection, promotion, the ability to &quot;bypass the hierarchy&quot;, the projection of the superior&#x27;s &quot;reflected power,&quot; access to otherwise invisible opportunities, and tutelage in corporate politics. The literature also showed the value of these benefits: for example, a &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; survey of 1,250 top executives published in 1979 showed that most employees that had been mentored or sponsored and that those who received such assistance reported higher incomes, better education, quicker paths to achievement, and more job satisfaction than those who did not. The literature particularly emphasized the necessity of mentoring for businesswomen&#x27;s success: although women comprised less than one percent of the executives in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; survey, all of these women reported being mentored. In subsequent decades, as mentoring became a widely valued phenomenon in the United States, women and minorities in particular continued to develop mentoring relationships consciously as they sought professional advancement.
* Reverse mentoring: While mentoring typically involves a more experienced, typically older employee or leader providing guidance to a younger employee, the opposite approach can also be used. With the rise of digital innovations, Internet applications, and social media in the 2000s, new, younger employees may be more familiar with these technologies than senior employees in organizations. The younger generations can help the older generations expand and grow with current trends.
* Knowledge transfer mentoring: Employees must have a certain set of skills in order to accomplish the tasks at hand. Mentoring can teach employees to be organized. It can also give them access to an expert that can provide feedback and answer questions.

Hetty van Emmerik did a similar study that looked at the effects of mentorship in the context of difficult working situations. Several major findings were made as a result of this research:

1. Mentoring has been linked to improved job performance (i.e. intrinsic job satisfaction and career satisfaction).

2. Mentoring diminishes the negative association between unfavourable working circumstances and positive job outcomes, making the relationship stronger for those without a mentor than for those who have one.

3. Mentoring has been found to be negatively connected with all three characteristics of burnout (emotional weariness, depersonalization, and decreased personal accomplishment) employee outcomes.

==Contemporary research and practice in the US==
Partly in response to a study by Daniel Levinson, research in the 1970s led some women and African Americans to question whether the classic &quot;white male&quot; model was available or customary for people who are newcomers in traditionally white male organizations. In 1978 Edgar Schein described multiple roles for successful mentors. He identified seven types of mentoring roles in his book &quot;Career Dynamics: Matching individual and organizational needs&quot; (1978). He said that some of these roles require the teacher to be, for example, an &quot;opener of doors, protector, sponsor and leader&quot;.

Capability frameworks encourage managers to mentor staff. Although a manager can mentor their own staff, they are more likely to mentor staff in other parts of their organisation, staff in special programs (such as graduate and leadership programs), staff in other organisations or members of professional associations.

Mentoring covers a range of roles. Articulating these roles is useful not only for understanding what role an employee plays, but also for writing job applications.

Two of Schein&#x27;s students, Davis and Garrison, studied successful leaders who differed in ethnicity and gender. Their research presented evidence for the roles of: cheerleader, coach, confidant, counsellor, developer of talent, &quot;griot&quot; (oral historian for the organization or profession), guardian, guru, inspiration, master, &quot;opener of doors&quot;, patron, role model, pioneer, &quot;seminal source&quot;, &quot;successful leader&quot;, and teacher. They described multiple mentoring practices which have since been given the name of &quot;mosaic mentoring&quot; to distinguish this kind of mentoring from the single mentor approach.

Mosaic mentoring is based on the concept that almost everyone can perform one or another function well for someone else — and also can learn along one of these lines from someone else. The model is seen as useful for people who are &quot;non-traditional&quot; in a traditional setting, such as non-white people and women in a traditionally white male organization. The idea has been well received in medical education literature.

==Corporate programs==
Corporate mentoring programs may be formal or informal and serve a variety of specific objectives, including the acclimation of new employees, skills development, employee retention, and diversity enhancement.

The relationship between mentoring, commitment, and turnover was investigated in one study at Texas A&amp;M University. &quot;Mentoring may really contribute to better degrees of emotional and lasting commitment to an organisation,&quot; according to the study&#x27;s findings. (Huffman and Payne, 2005).

===Formal programs===
Formal mentoring programs offer employees the opportunity to participate in an organized mentoring program. Participants join as a mentor, learner, or both by completing a mentoring profile. Mentoring profiles are completed as written forms on paper or computer or filled out via an online form as part of an online mentoring system. Learners are matched with a mentor by a program administrator or a mentoring committee, or they may self-select a mentor depending on the program format.

Informal mentoring takes place in organizations that develop a culture of mentoring but do not have formal mentoring in place. These companies may provide some tools and resources and encourage managers to accept mentoring requests from more junior members of the organization.

A study of 1,162 employees found that &quot;satisfaction with a mentoring relationship had a stronger impact on attitudes than the presence of a mentor, whether the relationship was formal or informal, or the design of a formal mentoring program&quot;. Even when a mentoring relationship is established, the actual relationship is more important than the presence of a relationship.

Fortune 500 companies are also implementing formal mentoring programs globally. Cardinal Health has had an enterprise-wide formal mentoring initiative in place since 2011. The initiative encompasses nine formal mentoring programs, some enterprise-wide and some limited to specific business segments and functions. Goals vary by program, with some focused on employees facing specific challenges or career milestones and others enabling more open-ended learning and development.

===New-hire programs===
New-hire mentoring programs are set up to help new employees adjust more quickly to the organization. In new-hire mentoring programs, newcomers to the organization (learners) are paired with more experienced people (mentors) in order to obtain information, good examples, and advice as they advance. Beverly Kaye and Sharon Jordan-Evans claim that new employees who are paired with a mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.

These mentoring relationships promote career growth and benefit both the mentor and the learner: for example, the mentor can show leadership by teaching; the organization receives an employee that is shaped by the organization&#x27;s culture and operation because they have been under the mentorship of an experienced member; and the learner can network, integrate easier into the organization, and acquire experience and advice. Donnalyn Pompper and Jonathan Adams say that &quot;joining a mentor&#x27;s network and developing one&#x27;s own is central to advancement&quot;, which likely explains why those mentored tend to do well in their organizations.

In the organizational setting, mentoring usually &quot;requires unequal knowledge&quot;, but the process of mentorship can differ. Bullis describes the mentoring process in the form of phase models. Initially, the &quot;mentee proves himself or herself worthy of the mentor&#x27;s time and energy&quot;. Then cultivation occurs which includes the actual &quot;coaching...a strong interpersonal bond between mentor and mentee develops&quot;. Next, under the phase of separation, &quot;the mentee experiences more autonomy&quot;. Ultimately, there is more equality in the relationship, termed by Bullis as Redefinition.

===High-potential programs===
High-potential mentoring programs are used to groom up-and-coming employees deemed to have the potential to move up into leadership or executive roles. The employee (learner) is paired with a senior-level leader (or leaders) for a series of career-coaching interactions. These programs tend to be smaller than general mentoring programs and learners that meet a list of criteria can be selected to participate. Another method of high-potential mentoring is to place the employee in a series of jobs in disparate areas of an organization (e.g. human resources, sales, operations management, etc.) for short periods of time, so they can learn in a hands-on, practical fashion, about the organization&#x27;s structure, culture, and methods.

==Matching approaches==
;Matching by committee
Learners are matched with mentors by a designated mentoring committee that usually consists of senior members of the training, learning and development group and/or the human resources departments The matching committee reviews the mentors&#x27; profiles and the coaching goals sought out by the learners and makes matches based on areas for development, mentor strengths, overall experience, skill set, location, and objectives.

;Matching through self-match technology
Mentoring technology, typically based on computer software, can be used to facilitate matches allowing learners to search for and select a mentor based on their own development, coaching needs, and interests. This learner-driven methodology increases the speed of matches being made and reduces the amount of administrative time required to manage the program. The quality of matches increases with self-match programs because mentorships tend to be more successful when the learner is involved in selecting their mentor. There are a variety of online mentoring technology programs available that can be used to facilitate this mentee-driven matching process.

;Speed networking
In speed networking, Mentors and learners are introduced to each other in short sessions, allowing each person to meet potential matches in a very short timeframe. Speed networking occurs as a one-time event in order for people &quot;to meet potential mentors to see if there is a fit for a longer term engagement&quot;.

;Mentoring direct reports
Mentoring direct reports may be considered a form of Transformational Leadership, specifically that of Individualized Consideration.

==In education==
Mentoring in education involves a relationship between two people where the mentor plays a supportive and advisory role for the student, the learner. This relationship promotes &quot;the development and growth of the latter&#x27;s skills and knowledge through the former&#x27;s experience&quot;.

Mentorship is crucial to high-quality education because it promotes individual development and growth while also ensuring the &quot;passing on&quot; of skills and professional standards to the next generation.

In many secondary and post-secondary schools, mentorship programs are offered to support students in program completion, confidence building, and transitioning to further education or the workforce. There are also peer mentoring programs designed specifically to bring under-represented populations into science and engineering.

=== Resilience ===
A specific focus of youth mentoring that addresses the issues that cause students to underachieve in education while simultaneously preparing them to deal with difficult circumstances that can affect their lives in the future and alter their success is the fostering of resilience. Resilience has been found to be a useful method when working with students from low socioeconomic backgrounds who often encounter crises or challenges and suffer specific traumas. Education, students&#x27; performance, and achievement in school are directly affected by these challenges, so certain negative psychological and environmental situations that students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds disproportionately encounter provide a framework for explaining the achievement gap. Resilience does not provide a solution to the struggles and trauma that these students experience, but instead focuses on giving them the tools to adapt to these situations and respond to them in ways that avoid negative outcomes and enables them to grow stronger and learn from the experience.

==== Protective factors and risk factors ====
Protective factors &quot;modify or transform responses to adverse events so that [students] avoid negative outcomes&quot; and encourage the development of resilience. Their development enables students to apply them to challenges and engage in them positively that does not negatively affect their education, personal lives, or successes. Examples of these protective factors identified by Reis, Colbert and Hebert in their three-year study of economically disadvantaged and ethnically diverse students include &quot;supportive adults, friendships with other achieving students, the opportunity to take honors and advanced classes, participation in multiple extracurricular activities both after school and during the summer, the development of a strong belief in the self, and ways to cope with the negative aspects of their school, urban and family environment.&quot; On the other hand, risk factors impede the student&#x27;s ability to positively engage in their challenges and in many cases prevent these students from achieving at the same level as students who do not encounter the same situations, and can include family tragedy, having an older sibling who became involved in drugs and/or alcohol, family instability, personal pain and academic failure. &quot;Just as risk factors and childhood stressors may co-occur within a particular population or within a particular developmental period, protective factors are also likely to occur together to some degree.&quot;

==== Counseling and guidance ====
Underachieving students who come from risk factor-filled environments often have little support, so the role of educators can be beneficial for students if it extends beyond the basic structures within the classroom. In these environments, students are often exposed to coercive interactions, so positive, personal and harmonious interchanges between the student and a supportive figure can help develop adaptive qualities. Teachers who see students as talented and care about them as individuals by establishing a genuine relationship create their additional roles as a mentor and advocate—an extra familial support system that can serve as an additional protective factor. A supportive adult can help reduce the negative impact of certain events and risk factors while strengthening the positive factors that help them cope effectively. Some of the components that facilitate the development of resilience when combined with a strong adult-student relationship include afterschool programs, more challenging classes, peer support programs, summer programs, and gifted programs. By getting to know students better—especially their home life and individual circumstances—teachers and counselors can provide specific support to each student by looking beyond their disadvantaged backgrounds, recognizing their abilities, nurturing their strengths, and maintaining high expectations.

=== Instructional coaches ===

Instructional coaches are former teachers or principals that have shown effectiveness in their work of teaching or leading and go through additional training to learn more about the technical skills needed to be an effective coach. In her book &quot;The Art of Coaching&quot;, Elena Aguilar recommends that a coach &quot;must have been an effective teacher for at least five years&quot;. Although skills that were effective in the classroom are required, the coach must also be confident in working with adults and bring strong listening, communication, and data analysis skills to the coaching position. Ultimately, an instructional coach is a former teacher who was successful in the classroom and is respected in the field, with the respect carrying over into this new position.

==== Activities ====
Coaches work one-on-one with teachers or in a small group setting with teachers to build student achievement in the classroom based on data collected and discussed by teachers or coaches. According to Melinda Mangin and KaiLonnie Dunsmore, instructional coaching models may include &quot;cognitive coaching, clinical supervision, peer coaching and mentoring, formal literacy coaching, informal coaching, or a mixed model.&quot; &quot;Other researchers have described categories of coaching such as data-oriented, student-oriented, managerial, and coaches who work with individual teachers or with groups of teachers&quot;. Ultimately, coaching roles are designed to increase teacher capacity and push teacher improvement through learning opportunities. Instructional coaching is embedded within a teacher&#x27;s work; in other words, the coach works with the teacher throughout the school year and meets during the school day with the teacher regarding current lessons, planning, and the observations and data collected. Discussions between the instructional coach and teacher are built upon mutual respect and a trusting relationship through confidentiality. Overall, instructional coaching is meant to serve as professional development for the teacher.

A coach&#x27;s main responsibility is to change a teacher&#x27;s practice and build their knowledge on &quot;new instructional materials, programs, and initiatives&quot;. This professional development can come from discussion, model lessons, and instructional strategies. Teacher observations are one of the most powerful ways that coaches can put data for change in front of teachers. Coaches making observations and collecting data to debrief with teachers helps facilitate teacher improvement.

==== Effectiveness ====
According to a three-year research study done by the Pennsylvania Institute for Instructional Coaching, there was an increase in student success when instructional coaching was used in the classroom. This could not be viewed as solely &quot;instructional coaching&quot; in isolation of other factors. The coaching &quot;model emphasizes the simultaneous use of four strategies: one-on-one teacher engagement; evidence-based literacy practices applied across the curriculum; data analytics; and reflection on practice&quot;. Teachers have shared that:

* Ninety-one percent of teachers coached regularly stated that coaches helped them understand and use new teaching strategies.
* Seventy-nine percent of teachers coached regularly said that their coach played a significant role in improving their classroom instruction and practice.
Teachers who were regularly coached one-on-one reported that:
* They made significant changes in their instructional practice.
* Their students were more engaged in the classroom and enthusiastic about learning.
* Attendance increased dramatically in their classes.
In addition to this, &quot;the most effective professional development model is thought to involve follow-up activities, usually in the form of long-term support, coaching in teachers&#x27; classrooms, or ongoing interaction with colleagues&quot;. In most cases, instructional coaching can provide this support and meet this definition of effective professional development.

===== Administrative support =====
Aguilar states that there should also be support from administration around the instructional coaching to align the work of the coach and teacher with the school&#x27;s mission or vision. Jim Knight focuses on the partnership with the principal being at the core of successful coaching and explains that the principal and the instructional coach need to be aligned in their goals for the coaching. If they have different desired outcomes for teaching, then the teacher will receive mixed messages and be caught between improvement and a standstill. Aguilar suggests that coaches continually ask about the school&#x27;s goals as well as action steps to bring into daily coaching to meet them.

===== Data-driven strategies =====
Knight&#x27;s belief of data usage is critical for teacher improvement during coaching sessions. He shares how giving opinions and telling a teacher how to improve stops the learning for the teacher; instead, it creates a barrier between the coach and teacher and makes the teacher expect to be instructed throughout the process.

===== Relationship building =====
The relationship and trust between the coach and coachee are a critical component of coaching. A coach that has specific content knowledge and respect in a teacher&#x27;s field of teaching can help build trust. Another way to build this trust is through confidentiality. In addition to relationship building, it is important to let the coachee feel comfortable talking to their coach about anything. Starting a coaching conversation about how a coachee is doing is also important to relationship building. Some famous mentors are Mr.bob weasly

===== Content and pedagogical knowledge =====
According to Nelson and Sassi, &quot;knowledge of pedagogical process and content knowledge must be fused&quot; in both understanding teaching and observing teaching. For example, an instructional coach working with a math teacher should know &quot;current mathematics education reform efforts are built on the notion that the ideas in a subject, and the ways in which students and teachers work with the ideas, matter&quot;. A deep pedagogical knowledge and deep content specific knowledge are required for the teacher to have confidence in the coach and for the coach to be able to step in and assume the role of the teacher.

Knowledge that coaches need to be effective includes content and pedagogical knowledge. Aguilar uses the ladder of inference to allow coaches to evaluate their own thoughts, and ultimately use this ladder to help principals and teachers evaluate their own beliefs before jumping to assumptions. Approaches to teaching, classroom management, and content knowledge can change.

==Blended mentoring==
Blended mentoring is the implementation of information technology (IT) into the traditional mentoring program, and is intended to give the opportunity to career counseling and development services to adopt mentoring in their standard practices. Compared to a strict form of e-mentoring where communication between the mentor and learner is done electronically, and the traditional model of face-to-face mentoring, blended mentoring has been found to increase student satisfaction (which is inherently tied to effectiveness) by combining online group mentoring sessions with individual, face-to-face meetings with a mentor. By incorporating IT with the traditional mentoring method, students can benefit from the technologies of e-mentoring while receiving direct and personal advice from the traditional method.

==Business mentoring==
Business mentoring differs from apprenticeship: a business mentor provides guidance to a business owner or an entrepreneur on the entrepreneur&#x27;s business, whereas an apprentice learns a trade by working on the job with the &quot;employer&quot;.

A 2012 literature review by EPS-PEAKS investigated business mentoring, mainly focused on the Middle-East and North Africa region. The review found strong evidence to suggest that business mentoring can have real benefits for entrepreneurs, but highlights some key factors that need to be considered when designing mentoring programmes, such as the need to balance formal and informal approaches and to appropriately match mentors and learners.

== Cup Framework of Mentoring ==
The Cup Framework is a form of learning about a mentor&#x27;s and mentee&#x27;s relationship. There are two factors to consider in relation to the mentee in this framework: content and context. The inputs that a mentee is absorbing are referred to as content. This is information about their profession, life, and other things that they constantly absorb, process, and comprehend during the day. The capacity of the mentee to understand and absorb information is referred to as context.

The Cup Framework can be used to create an organisational culture that values and encourages employee growth, as well as allowing mentors to feel fulfilled in their roles without having to invest too much time and attention away from their own work.

<text>The Modern Library is an American book publishing imprint and formerly the parent company of Random House. Founded in 1917 by Albert Boni and Horace Liveright as an imprint of their publishing company Boni &amp; Liveright, Modern Library became an independent publishing company in 1925 when Boni &amp; Liveright sold it to Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. Random House began in 1927 as a subsidiary of the Modern Library and eventually overtook its parent company, with Modern Library becoming an imprint of Random House.

== Recent history ==

The Modern Library originally published only hardbound books. In 1950, it began publishing the Modern Library College Editions, a forerunner of its current series of paperback classics. From 1955 to 1960, the company published a high quality, numbered paperback series, but discontinued it in 1960, when the series was merged into the newly acquired Vintage paperbacks group. The Modern Library homepage states:

In 1992, on the occasion of the Modern Library&#x27;s seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House embarked on an ambitious project to refurbish the series. We revived the torchbearer emblem that Cerf and Klopfer commissioned in 1925 from Lucian Bernhard. The Promethean bearer of enlightenment (known informally around the old Modern Library offices as the &quot;dame running away from Bennett Cerf&quot;) was redesigned several times over the years, most notably by Rockwell Kent.

In 1998, novelist David Ebershoff became the Modern Library&#x27;s new Publishing Director. Ebershoff managed the imprint until 2005, when he resigned to concentrate on his own writing and to become editor-at-large at Random House.

== Modern Library lists ==

At its onset the Modern Library identified itself as &quot;The Modern Library of the World&#x27;s Best Books&quot;. In keeping with that brand identity, in 1998 the editors created a list they called the &quot;Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels&quot;, numbering 100 titles selected from books published by Modern Library and its Random House affiliates. They also conducted an internet poll of public opinion, then produced a &quot;readers&quot;&#x27; list. (The lists were actually restricted to works in English, but titles of the lists do not represent this, and little attention was paid to that fact in publicity for the lists.)

The &quot;top ten&quot; of the editors&#x27; list is shown here—and the two &quot;100 Best Novels&quot; lists are linked below.

According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about the list, executives at Random House said they hoped that as the century drew to a close their list would encourage public debate about the greatest works of fiction of the last hundred years, thus both increasing awareness of the Modern Library and stimulating sales of novels the group publishes.

Both lists have incurred criticism. Their ranking system concerned many professional scholars and critics. The board members themselves, who did not create the rankings and were unaware of it until the list was published, expressed disappointment and puzzlement. There were also hypotheses that the Modern Library merely made a selection based on its stocklist. A. S. Byatt, the well-known English novelist who was on the board, called the list &quot;typically American&quot;.

The list was compiled via approval voting, by sending each board member a list of 440 pre-selected books from the Modern Library catalogue and asking each member to place a check beside novels they wished to choose. Then the works with the most votes were ranked the highest, and ties were decided arbitrarily by Random House publishers. This explains surprising results like the No. 5 placement of &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1932), which most of the judges agreed belonged &quot;somewhere&quot; on the list, but much lower than the very top.

David Ebershoff, the Modern Library division&#x27;s publishing director, stated in a follow-up &quot;the people who were drawn to go to the Modern Library Web site and compelled to vote have a certain enthusiasm about books and their favourite books that many people don&#x27;t, so that the voting population is skewed.&quot; In addition, people were allowed to vote repeatedly, once per day, making the poll a measure of how much effort people would put into promoting their favorite books. Others have been more direct in their descriptions of the results; librarian Robert Teeter remarks that the ballot boxes were &quot;stuffed by cultists&quot;.

<doc id="227120" wikidata="Q2911171" url="?curid=227120" title="Package-deal fallacy">
<text>The package-deal fallacy (also known as false conjunction) is the logical fallacy of assuming that things often grouped together by tradition or culture must always be grouped that way. False conjunction refers to misuse of the &quot;and&quot; operator. 

It is particularly common in political arguments, such as the following imagined example from the United States: &quot;My opponent is a conservative who voted against higher taxes and welfare, therefore he will also oppose gun control and abortion.&quot; While those four positions are often grouped together as &quot;conservative&quot; in United States politics, a person may believe in one &quot;conservative&quot; idea while not believing in another.

== Additional examples ==
* &quot;John likes surprises, so he&#x27;ll enjoy finding a snake in his sleeping bag.&quot;
: Assumes a surprise is inherently a good thing does not consider the actual context of an event.
* &quot;Droughts are common during summers in Country X, so water is hard to find there in August.&quot;
: It hasn&#x27;t rained in Country X for a while, but there may well be plenty of water reserves available. Also, seasons are different between the two hemispheres; if Country X is in the southern hemisphere, August will be in winter. Lastly, just because droughts are common in summer in country X does not mean they must occur &quot;every summer.&quot; That August may have been one of the summers a drought did not occur.
* &quot;A child molester was caught in a nearby neighborhood. He was friends with many of his neighbors. Everyone in that whole neighborhood is sick.&quot;
: Assumes that the neighbors knew that their friend was a sex offender and implies their endorsement of such activity. Assumes guilt by association under incidental circumstances.

==When it is not a fallacy==

The package-deal argument does not need to be a fallacy when used to argue that things grouped by culture and tradition are &quot;likely&quot; to be grouped in a given way.

===Examples===
* &quot;John enjoys science fiction films, so chances are he&#x27;ll enjoy Star Wars.&quot;
: While it is not guaranteed that John will like Star Wars, we can tell from information about him that he probably will.
* &quot;There has been a serious drought in Country X for a while, and it is not very developed, so many of its inhabitants are probably starving.&quot;
: Most developing countries do face famine when drought occurs, so it is likely that this is the case in Country X, even if it is not guaranteed.

== Alternative interpretation ==
Philosopher Ayn Rand used the term to describe a different fallacy in which essentially different concepts or ideas are “packaged” together and treated as though they are essentially similar.

=== Definition ===
Rand wrote: &quot;&#x27;Package-dealing&#x27; is the fallacy of failing to discriminate crucial differences. It consists of treating together, as parts of a single conceptual whole or &#x27;package,&#x27; elements which differ essentially in nature, truth-status, importance, or value.&quot;

It is important to stress that the package deal fallacy concerns solely those errors of reasoning which mistreat the &quot;essential&quot; characteristics of concepts.

=== Examples ===

==== Selfishness and Self-Interest ====
Rand pointed out that, in popular usage, the term “selfishness” constitutes a package deal because it’s used as a moral evaluation, even though no such evaluation is contained or implied in the word’s meaning:The meaning ascribed in popular usage to the word “selfishness” is not merely wrong: it represents a devastating intellectual “package-deal,” which is responsible, more than any other single factor, for the arrested moral development of mankind.

In popular usage, the word “selfishness” is a synonym of evil; the image it conjures is of a murderous brute who tramples over piles of corpses to achieve his own ends, who cares for no living being and pursues nothing but the gratification of the mindless whims of any immediate moment.

Yet the exact meaning and dictionary definition of the word “selfishness” is: concern with one’s own interests.

This concept does not include a moral evaluation; it does not tell us whether concern with one’s own interests is good or evil; nor does it tell us what constitutes man’s actual interests. It is the task of ethics to answer such questions. . . .

There is a fundamental moral difference between a man who sees his self-interest in production and a man who sees it in robbery. The evil of a robber does not lie in the fact that he pursues his own interests, but in what he regards as to his own interest; not in the fact that he pursues his values, but in what he chose to value; not in the fact that he wants to live, but in the fact that he wants to live on a subhuman level.Some modern dictionaries define selfishness and/or self-interest in line with popular usage. Merriam-Webster lists this definition of the former: “the quality or state of being selfish; a concern for one’s own welfare or advantage at the expense of or in disregard of others.” Rand pointed out that this definition is self-contradictory because true concern for one’s own welfare (a state of genuine wellbeing) requires mutually beneficial relationships with others and so precludes unfair treatment or disregard of them:When one speaks of man’s right to exist for his own sake, for his own rational self-interest, most people assume automatically that this means his right to sacrifice others. Such an assumption is a confession of their own belief that to injure, enslave, rob or murder others is in man’s self-interest—which he must selflessly renounce. The idea that man’s self-interest can be served only by a non-sacrificial relationship with others has never occurred to those humanitarian apostles of unselfishness, who proclaim their desire to achieve the brotherhood of men. And it will not occur to them, or to anyone, so long as the concept “rational” is omitted from the context of “values,” “desires,” “self-interest” and ethics.

==== Altruism ====
Rand also identified altruism as a package deal when it is regarded as synonymous with or integral to morality:There are two moral questions which altruism lumps together into one “package-deal”: (1) What are values? (2) Who should be the beneficiary of values? Altruism substitutes the second for the first; it evades the task of defining a code of moral values, thus leaving man, in fact, without moral guidance.

Altruism declares that any action taken for the benefit of others is good, and any action taken for one’s own benefit is evil. Thus the beneficiary of an action is the only criterion of moral value—and so long as that beneficiary is anybody other than oneself, anything goes.Identifying behaviors and double standards common in virtually all modern societies, Rand offered the following examples of ways in which the beneficiary of an action is often used as a standard of moral judgment:Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others, but not your own? If enjoyment is a value, why is it moral when experienced by others, but immoral when experienced by you? If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others? Why is it immoral for you to desire, but moral for others to do so? Why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it, but moral to give it away? And if it is not moral for you to keep a value, why is it moral for others to accept it? If you are selfless and virtuous when you give it, are they not selfish and vicious when they take it? Does virtue consist of serving vice?

==== Power ====
Many people conflate political power and economic power, which are wholly different concepts.

Political power is the ability to legally employ or threaten physical force against others, typically via legislation, regulation, or taxation. Possible penalties for noncompliance, such as fines, arrest, and imprisonment, are ultimately backed by a threat of physical force.

Economic power, by contrast, is characterized primarily by the &quot;absence&quot; of physical force; buyers and sellers exchange goods and services voluntarily or not at all. Lumping together economic and political power under the broader concept “power” while ignoring the crucial differences between them constitutes a package deal.

<doc id="227123" wikidata="Q746186" url="?curid=227123" title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">
<text>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA; ) is a regulatory agency of the United States Department of Labor that originally had federal visitorial powers to inspect and examine workplaces. The United States Congress established the agency under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), which President Richard M. Nixon signed into law on December 29, 1970. OSHA&#x27;s mission is to &quot;assure safe and healthy working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education, and assistance.&quot; The agency is also charged with enforcing a variety of whistleblower statutes and regulations. OSHA&#x27;s workplace safety inspections have been shown to reduce injury rates and injury costs without adverse effects on employment, sales, credit ratings, or firm survival.

==History==
The Bureau of Labor Standards of the Department of Labor has worked on some work safety issues since its creation in 1934. Economic boom and associated labor turnover during World War II worsened work safety in nearly all areas of the United States economy, but after 1945 accidents again declined as long-term forces reasserted themselves. Additionally, new and powerful labor unions played an increasingly important role in worker safety post-World War II. In the 1960s, increasing economic expansion again led to rising injury rates, and the resulting political pressures led Congress to establish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on April 28, 1971, the date that the Occupational Health and Safety Act became effective. The new agency incorporated much of what had been the original Bureau of Labor Standards. George Guenther was appointed by Labor Secretary James D. Hodgson as the agency&#x27;s first director.

OSHA has run a number of training, compliance assistance, and health and safety recognition programs throughout its history. The OSHA Training Institute, which trains government and private sector health and safety personnel, began in 1972. In 1978, the agency began a grant-making program, now called the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program, to train workers and employers in reducing workplace hazards. OSHA started the Voluntary Protection Programs in 1982, which allow employers to apply as &quot;model workplaces&quot; to achieve special designation if they meet certain requirements.

==OSH Act coverage==
The OSH Act covers most private-sector employers and their workers, in addition to some public-sector employers and workers in the 50 states and certain territories and jurisdictions under federal authority. Those jurisdictions include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Wake Island, Johnston Island, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

===Private sector employers===

The OSH Act covers most private sector employers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other U.S. jurisdictions—either directly through federal OSHA or through an OSHA-approved state plan.

State plans are OSHA-approved job safety and health programs operated by individual states instead of federal OSHA. Federal OSHA approves and monitors all state plans and provides as much as fifty percent of the funding for each program. State-run safety and health programs are required to be at least as effective as the federal OSHA program.

The following 22 states or territories have OSHA-approved state programs: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.

Federal OSHA provides coverage to certain workplaces specifically excluded from a state&#x27;s plan, such as work in maritime industries or on military bases.

===State and local governments===

Workers at state and local government agencies are not covered by federal OSHA but have OSH Act protections if they work in those states that have an OSHA-approved state program. OSH Act rules also permit states and territories to develop plans that cover only public sector (state and local government) workers. In these cases, private sector workers and employers remain under federal OSHA jurisdiction. Five additional states and one U.S. territory have OSHA-approved state plans that cover public sector workers only: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey, New York, and the Virgin Islands.

===Federal government agencies===

OSHA&#x27;s protection applies to all federal agencies. Section 19 of the OSH Act makes federal agency heads responsible for providing safe and healthful working conditions for their workers. OSHA conducts inspections of federal facilities in response to workers&#x27; reports of hazards and under programs that target high-hazard federal workplaces.

Federal agencies must have a safety and health program that meets the same standards as private employers. OSHA issues “virtual fines” to federal agencies – following an inspection where violations are found, OSHA issues a press release stating the size of the fine would be if the federal agency were a private sector employer. Under a 1998 amendment, the OSH Act covers the U.S. Postal Service the same as any private sector employer.

===Not covered under the OSH Act===

The OSH Act does not cover the self-employed, immediate family members of farm employers, or workplace hazards regulated by another federal agency (for example, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Energy, or Coast Guard).

==Rights and responsibilities under OSH Act law==

Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe workplace.

By law, employers must provide their workers with a workplace that does not have serious hazards, and they must follow all OSH Act safety and health standards. Employers are obligated to identify and rectify safety and health problems. The OSH Act further requires that employers must first attempt to eliminate or reduce hazards by making feasible changes in working conditions, rather than relying solely on personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves, or earplugs. Examples of effective ways to eliminate or reduce risks include switching to safer chemicals, enclosing processes to trap harmful fumes, or using ventilation systems to clean the air.

Employers must also:
* Inform workers about chemical hazards through training, labels, alarms, color-coded systems, chemical information sheets, and other relevant methods..
* Provide safety training to workers in a language and vocabulary they can understand.
* Keep accurate records of work-related injuries and illnesses.
* Perform tests in the workplace, such as air sampling, required by some OSH Act standards.
* Provide the required personal protective equipment at no cost to workers, as employers must pay for most types of required personal protective equipment.
* Provide hearing exams or other medical tests when required by OSH Act standards.
* Post OSHA citations and annually post injury and illness summary data where workers can see them.
* Notify OSHA within eight hours of a workplace fatality and within 24 hours of all work-related inpatient hospitalizations.
* Prominently display the official OSHA Job Safety and Health – It&#x27;s the Law poster that describes rights and responsibilities under the OSH Act.
* Not retaliate or discriminate against workers for using their rights under the law, including their right to report a work-related injury or illness.
Workers have the right to:
* Working conditions that do not pose a risk of serious harm.
* File a confidential complaint with OSHA to have their workplace inspected.
* Receive information and training about hazards, methods to prevent harm, and the OSH Act standards that apply to their workplace. The training must be conducted in a language and vocabulary that workers can understand.
* Receive copies of records of work-related injuries and illnesses that occur in their workplace.
* Receive copies of the results from tests and monitoring conducted to identify and measure hazards in their workplace.
* Receive copies of their workplace medical records.
* Participate in an OSHA inspection and speak in private with the inspector.
* File a complaint with OSHA if they have faced retaliation or discrimination from their employer as a result of requesting an inspection or exercising any of their other rights under the OSH Act.
* File a complaint if punished or retaliated against for acting as a &#x27;whistleblower&#x27; under the 21 additional federal laws for which OSHA has jurisdiction.

Temporary workers must be treated like permanent employees. Staffing agencies and host employers share joint accountability for temporary workers. Both entities are therefore obligated to comply with workplace health and safety requirements and ensure worker safety and health. OSHA could hold both the host and temporary employers responsible for any violations.

==Health and safety standards==
The Occupational Safety and Health Act grants OSHA the authority to issue workplace health and safety regulations. These regulations include limits on hazardous chemical exposure, employee access to hazard information, requirements for the use of personal protective equipment, and requirements to prevent falls and hazards from operating dangerous equipment.

The OSH Act&#x27;s current Construction, General Industry, Maritime, and Agriculture standards are designed to protect workers from a wide range of serious hazards. Examples of OSHA standards include requirements for employers to provide fall protection such as a safety harness/line or guardrails; prevent trenching cave-ins; prevent exposure to some infectious diseases; ensure the safety of workers who enter confined spaces; prevent exposure to harmful chemicals; put guards on dangerous machines; provide respirators or other safety equipment, and provide training for certain dangerous jobs in a language and vocabulary workers can understand.

OSHA sets enforceable permissible exposure limits (PELs) to protect workers against the health effects of exposure to hazardous substances, including limits on the airborne concentrations of hazardous chemicals in the air. Most of OSHA&#x27;s PELs were issued shortly after the adoption of the OSH Act in 1970. Attempts to issue more stringent PELs have been blocked by litigation from the industry; thus, the vast majority of PELs have not been updated since 1971. The agency has issued non-binding, alternate occupational exposure limits that may better protect workers.

Employers must also comply with the General Duty Clause of the OSH Act. This clause requires employers to keep their workplaces free of serious recognized hazards and is generally cited when no specific OSHA standard applies to the hazard.

In its first year of operation, OSHA was permitted to adopt regulations based on guidelines set by certain standards organizations, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, without going through all of the requirements of a typical rule-making.
OSHA is granted the authority to promulgate standards that prescribe the methods employers are legally required to follow to protect their workers from hazards. Before OSHA can issue a standard, it must go through a very extensive and lengthy process that includes substantial public engagement, notice, and comment. The agency must show that a significant risk to workers exists and that there are feasible measures employers can take to protect their workers.

In 2000, OSHA issued an ergonomics standard. In March 2001, Congress voted to repeal the standard through the Congressional Review Act. The repeal, one of the first major pieces of legislation signed by President George W. Bush, is the first instance that Congress has successfully used the Congressional Review Act to block regulation.

Since 2001, OSHA has issued the following standards:
* 2002: Exit Routes, Emergency Action Plans, and Fire Prevention Plans
* 2004: Commercial Diving Operations
* 2004: Fire Protection in Shipyards
* 2006: Occupational Exposure to Hexavalent Chromium
* 2006: Assigned Protection Factors for Respiratory Protection Equipment
* 2007: Electrical Installation Standard
* 2007: Personal Protective Equipment Payment (Clarification)
* 2008: Vertical Tandem Lifts
* 2010: Cranes and Derricks in Construction
* 2010: General Working Conditions in Shipyards
* 2012: GHS Update to the Hazard Communication Standard
* 2014: New Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Employers
* 2014: Revision to Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution; Electrical Protective Equipment
* 2016: Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica
* 2016: Update General Industry Walking-Working Surfaces and Fall Protection Standards 

==Enforcement==

OSHA is responsible for enforcing its standards on regulated entities. Compliance Safety and Health Officers carry out inspections and assess fines for regulatory violations. Inspections are planned for worksites in particularly hazardous industries. Inspections can also be triggered by a workplace fatality, multiple hospitalizations, worker complaints, or referrals.

OSHA is a small agency, given the size of its mission: with its state partners, OSHA has approximately 2,400 inspectors covering more than 8 million workplaces where 130 million workers are employed. In Fiscal Year 2012 (ending Sept. 30), OSHA and its state partners conducted more than 83,000 inspections of workplaces across the United States — just a fraction of the nation&#x27;s worksites. According to a report by AFL–CIO, it would take OSHA 129 years to inspect all workplaces under its jurisdiction.

Enforcement plays an important part in OSHA&#x27;s efforts to reduce workplace injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. Inspections are initiated without advance notice, conducted using on-site or telephone and facsimile investigations, performed by trained compliance officers and scheduled based on the following priorities [highest to lowest]: imminent danger; catastrophes – fatalities or hospitalizations; worker complaints and referrals; targeted inspections – particular hazards, high injury rates; and follow-up inspections.

Current workers or their representatives may file a complaint and ask OSHA to inspect their workplace if they believe that there is a serious hazard or that their employer is not following OSHA standards. Workers and their representatives have the right to ask for an inspection without OSHA telling their employer who filed the complaint. It is a violation of the OSH Act for an employer to fire, demote, transfer or in any way discriminate against a worker for filing a complaint or using other OSHA rights.

When an inspector finds violations of OSHA standards or serious hazards, OSHA may issue citations and fines. A citation includes methods an employer may use to fix a problem and the date by which the corrective actions must be completed.

OSHA&#x27;s fines are very low compared with other government agencies. They were raised for the first time since 1990 on August 2, 2016, to comply with the 2015 Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act passed by Congress to advance the effectiveness of civil monetary penalties and to maintain their deterrent effect. The new law directs agencies to adjust their penalties for inflation each year. The maximum OSHA fine for a serious violation is $13,653 (which can be assessed daily after a failure to &quot;abate&quot; the violation) and the maximum fine for a repeat or willful violation is $136,532. In determining the amount of the proposed penalty, OSHA must take into account the gravity of the alleged violation and the employer&#x27;s size of business, good faith, and history of previous violations. Employers have the right to contest any part of the citation, including whether a violation actually exists. Workers only have the right to challenge the deadline by which a problem must be resolved. Appeals of citations are heard by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC).

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused about 1,300 workers and their families to contract the virus, with four deaths, at the Smithfield Foods packing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The governor, Kristi Noem, resisted initiating and enforcing measures to protect workers and the community. The plant was fined $13,494 – the maximum allowed at the time – by OSHA for what was considered a single violation.

OSHA carries out its enforcement activities through its 10 regional offices and 85 area offices. OSHA&#x27;s regional offices are located in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle.

==Record keeping requirements==
Tracking and investigating workplace injuries and illnesses play an important role in preventing future injuries and illnesses. Under OSHA&#x27;s Recordkeeping regulation, certain covered employers in high-hazard industries are required to prepare and maintain records of serious occupational injuries and illnesses. This information is important for employers, workers, and OSHA in evaluating the safety of a workplace, understanding industry hazards, and implementing worker protections to reduce and eliminate hazards.

Employers with more than ten employees and whose establishments are not classified as a partially exempt industry must record serious work-related injuries and illnesses using OSHA Forms 300, 300A and 301. Recordkeeping forms, requirements, and exemption information are on OSHA&#x27;s website.

==Whistleblower Protection Program ==
OSHA&#x27;s Whistleblower Protection Program (WPP) enforces the whistleblower provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and 24 other statutes protecting workers who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, maritime and securities laws. Unlike OSHA&#x27;s Safety Enforcement complaints (or referrals) being completely anonymous, OSHA&#x27;s whistleblower investigations can not be anonymous as a Respondent is required to address all allegations of adverse actions taken against Complainant&#x27;s employment. Additionally, these whistleblower investigations follow the McDonnell-Douglas burden shifting framework. WPP&#x27;s Investigators conduct complex investigations pertaining to complaints of retaliation by an employer (Respondent) against an employee (Complainant) who reported a violation(s) covered under one of the 25 statutes. 

WPP Investigators act as neutral fact-finders; they do not work for either the Complainant or Respondent. A WPP Investigator&#x27;s job is to impartially gather and analyze all relevant evidence to determine whether unlawful whistleblower retaliation has occurred. Over the years, OSHA&#x27;s WPP has been responsible for enforcing these laws that protect the rights of workers to speak up without fear of retaliation, regardless of the relationship of these laws to occupational safety and health matters.

==Compliance assistance==

OSHA has developed several training, compliance assistance, and health and safety recognition programs throughout its history.

The OSHA Training Institute, which trains government and private sector health and safety personnel, began in 1972. In 1978, the agency began a grant-making program, now called the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program, to train workers and employers in identifying and reducing workplace hazards.

The Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) recognizes employers and workers in private industry and federal agencies who have implemented effective safety and health management programs and maintain injury and illness rates below the national average for their respective industries. In VPP, management, labor, and OSHA work cooperatively and proactively to prevent fatalities, injuries, and illnesses through a system focused on: hazard prevention and control, worksite analysis, training, and management commitment and worker involvement.

OSHA&#x27;s On-site Consultation Program offers free and confidential advice to small and medium-sized businesses in all states across the country, with priority given to high-hazard worksites. Each year, responding to requests from small employers looking to create or improve their safety and health management programs, OSHA&#x27;s On-site Consultation Program conducts over 29,000 visits to small business worksites covering over 1.5 million workers across the nation. On-site consultation services are separate from enforcement and do not result in penalties or citations. Consultants from state agencies or universities work with employers to identify workplace hazards, provide advice on compliance with OSHA standards, and assist in establishing safety and health management programs.

Under the consultation program, certain exemplary employers may request participation in OSHA&#x27;s Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP). Eligibility for participation includes, but is not limited to, receiving a full-service, comprehensive consultation visit, correcting all identified hazards, and developing an effective safety and health management program. Worksites that receive SHARP recognition are exempt from programmed inspections during the period that the SHARP certification is valid.

OSHA also provides compliance assistance through its national and area offices. Through hundreds of publications in a variety of languages, website safety, and health topics pages, and through compliance assistance staff, OSHA provides information to employers and workers on specific hazards and OSHA rights and responsibilities.

== Efficacy ==
A 2012 study in &quot;Science&quot; found that OSHA&#x27;s random workplace safety inspections caused a &quot;9.4% decline in injury rates&quot; and a &quot;26% reduction in injury cost&quot; for the inspected firms. The study found &quot;no evidence that these improvements came at the expense of employment, sales, credit ratings, or firm survival.&quot; A 2020 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; found that the decision by the Obama administration to issue press releases that named and shamed facilities that violated OSHA safety and health regulations led other facilities to increase their compliance and to experience fewer workplace injuries. The study estimated that each press release had the same effect on compliance as 210 inspections.

Much of the debate about OSHA regulations and enforcement policies revolve around the cost of regulations and enforcement, versus the actual benefit in reduced worker injury, illness, and death. A 1995 study of several OSHA standards by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) found that OSHA relies &quot;generally on methods that provide a credible basis for the determinations essential to rulemaking.&quot; Though it found that OSHA&#x27;s findings and estimates are &quot;subject to vigorous review and challenge&quot;, it stated that this is natural because &quot;interested parties and experts involved in rulemakings have differing visions.&quot;

OSHA has come under considerable criticism for the ineffectiveness of its penalties, particularly its criminal penalties. The maximum penalty is a misdemeanor with a maximum of 6 months in jail. In response to the criticism, OSHA, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, has pursued several high-profile criminal prosecutions for violations under the Act and has announced a joint enforcement initiative between OSHA and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which has the ability to issue much higher fines than OSHA. Meanwhile, Congressional Democrats, labor unions, and community safety and health advocates are attempting to revise the OSH Act to make it a felony with much higher penalties to commit a willful violation that results in the death of a worker. Some local prosecutors are charging company executives with manslaughter and other felonies when criminal negligence leads to the death of a worker.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation in 2003 showed that over the 20-year period from 1982 to 2002, 2,197 workers died in 1,242 incidents in which OSHA investigators concluded that employers had willfully violated workplace safety laws. In 93% of these fatality cases arising from wilful violation, OSHA made no referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The &quot;Times&quot; investigation found that OSHA had failed to pursue prosecution &quot;even when employers had been cited before for the very same safety violation&quot; and even in cases where multiple workers died. In interviews, current and former OSHA officials said that the low rates of criminal enforcement were the result of &quot;a bureaucracy that works at every level to thwart criminal referrals. ... that fails to reward, and sometimes penalizes, those who push too hard for prosecution&quot; and that &quot; aggressive enforcement [was] suffocated by endless layers of review.

OSHA has also been criticized for taking too long to develop new regulations. For instance, speaking about OSHA under the George W. Bush presidency on the specific issue of combustible dust explosions, Chemical Safety Board appointee Carolyn Merritt said: &quot;The basic disappointment has been this attitude of no new regulation. They don&#x27;t want the industry to be pestered. In some instances, the industry has to be pestered in order to comply.&quot;

<text>James Albert Michener ( or ; February 3, 1907 – October 16, 1997) was an American writer. He wrote more than 40 books, most of which were long, fictional family sagas covering the lives of many generations, set in particular geographic locales and incorporating detailed history. Many of his works were bestsellers and were chosen by the Book of the Month Club. He was also known for the meticulous research that went into his books.

Michener&#x27;s books include his first book, &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1948; &quot;Hawaii&quot;; &quot;The Drifters&quot;; &quot;Centennial&quot;; &quot;The Source&quot;; &quot;The Fires of Spring&quot;; &quot;Chesapeake&quot;; &quot;Caribbean&quot;; &quot;Caravans&quot;; &quot;Alaska&quot;; &quot;Texas&quot;; &quot;Space&quot;; &quot;Poland&quot;; and &quot;The Bridges at Toko-ri&quot;. His non-fiction works include &quot;Iberia&quot;, about his travels in Spain and Portugal; his memoir, &quot;The World Is My Home&quot;; and &quot;Sports in America&quot;. &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; combines fictional short stories with Michener&#x27;s factual descriptions of the Pacific areas where they take place.

&quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; was adapted as the popular Broadway musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;, by Rodgers and Hammerstein. The musical in turn was adapted as a feature film in 1958 and 2001, adding to his financial success. A number of his other stories and novels were adapted for films and TV series.

He also wrote &quot;Presidential Lottery: The Reckless Gamble in Our Electoral System&quot;, in which he condemned the United States&#x27; Electoral College system. It was published in 1969, and republished in 2014 and 2016.

==Early life and education==
Michener was born in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, on February 3, 1907. He later wrote that he did not know who his biological parents were, or exactly when or where he was born. He was raised a Quaker by an adoptive mother, Mabel Michener, in Doylestown.

Michener graduated from Doylestown High School in 1925. He attended Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, where he played college basketball and was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. After graduating summa cum laude in 1929, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and History, he traveled and studied in Scotland at the University of St Andrews in the medieval town of St. Andrews, Fife, on the coast of the North Sea for two years.

Michener talks about hoboing, the practice of riding freight trains for free, during the Great Depression, as mentioned in the 1998 Great Depression documentary on the History Channel.

Michener took a job as a high school English teacher at The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. From 1933 to 1936, he taught English at George School in Newtown, Pennsylvania. He attended Colorado State Teachers College, later renamed the University of Northern Colorado, in Greeley, Colorado, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in education.

==Career==
After graduation, Michener taught at the university and at College High School. The Michener Library at the University of Northern Colorado was named after him in October 1972.

In 1939, Michener accepted a position as a guest lecturer at Harvard University, where he worked for a year. He left to join Macmillan Publishers as their social studies education editor.

As a Quaker, he could have qualified as a conscientious objector and not been drafted into the military, but Michener enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. He traveled throughout the South Pacific Ocean on various assignments which he gained because his base commanders mistakenly thought his father was Admiral Marc Mitscher. His experiences during these travels inspired the stories published in his breakout work &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;.

===Writing career===
Michener began his writing career during World War II, when as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy he was assigned to the South Pacific as a naval historian. He later turned his notes and impressions into &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; (1947), his first book, published when he was age 40. It won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1948, and Rodgers and Hammerstein adapted it as the hit Broadway musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in New York City in 1949. The musical was also adapted as eponymous feature films in 1958 and 2001.

Michener tried television writing but was unsuccessful. American television producer Bob Mann wanted Michener to co-create a weekly anthology series from &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; and serve as narrator. Rodgers and Hammerstein, however, had bought all dramatic rights to the novel and did not relinquish their ownership. Michener did lend his name to a different television series, &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, in 1959, starring Gardner McKay as Captain Adam Troy in the sailing ship &quot;Tiki III&quot;.

Michener was a popular writer during his lifetime; his novels sold an estimated 75 million copies worldwide. His novel &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1959), well-timed on its publication when Hawaii became the 50th state, was based on extensive research. He used this approach for nearly all of his subsequent novels, which were based on detailed historical, cultural, and even geological research. &quot;Centennial&quot; (1974), which documented several generations of families in the Rocky Mountains of the American West, was adapted as a popular 12-part television miniseries of the same name and aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC television network) from October 1978 through February 1979.

In the mid-1970s, Michener was a contributor to the &quot;Readers&#x27; Guide to Periodical Literature&quot;.

In 1996, State House Press published &quot;James A. Michener: A Bibliography&quot;, compiled by David A. Groseclose. Its more than 2,500 entries from 1923 to 1995 include magazine articles, forewords, and other works.

Michener&#x27;s prodigious output made for lengthy novels, several of which run more than 1,000 pages. The author states in &quot;My Lost Mexico&quot; (1992) that at times he would spend 12 to 15 hours per day at his typewriter for weeks on end, and that he used so much paper, his filing system had trouble keeping up.

==Personal life==
Michener was married three times. In 1935, he married Patti Koon. In 1948, they divorced, and the same year Michener married his second wife, Vange Nord. Michener met his third wife, Mari Yoriko Sabusawa, at a luncheon in Chicago. An American, she and her Japanese parents were interned in western camps that the U.S. government set up during the early years of World War II to hold ethnic Japanese from West Coast / Pacific communities. Michener divorced Nord in 1955 and married Sabusawa the same year. Sabusawa died in 1994.

Michener&#x27;s novel &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1954) is quasi-autobiographical. Set during the early 1950s, it tells the story of Major Lloyd Gruver, a United States Air Force ace jet pilot in the Korean War (1950–1953), now stationed in Japan, who falls in love with Hana-ogi, a Japanese woman. The novel follows their cross-cultural romance and illuminates the racism of the post-World War II time period. In 1957 it was adapted into the highly successful movie &quot;Sayonara&quot; which starred Marlon Brando, James Garner, Miiko Taka, Miyoshi Umeki and Red Buttons; Umeki and Buttons both won the 1958 Academy Award (&quot;Oscar&quot;) for best supporting actor / actress for their performances.

===Political career===

In the 1960 presidential election, Michener was chairman of the Bucks County, Pennsylvania committee to elect Democrat John F. Kennedy as the 35th President. In 1962, he unsuccessfully ran as a Democratic Party candidate for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania, a decision he later considered a misstep. &quot;My mistake was to run in 1962 as a Democratic candidate for Congress. [My wife] kept saying, &#x27;Don&#x27;t do it, don&#x27;t do it.&#x27; I lost and went back to writing books.&quot; In his memoir &quot;The World Is My Home&quot;, Michener would describe running for office as &quot;one of the best things I&#x27;ve done because campaigning in public knocks sense into a man.&quot;

In 1968, Michener served as campaign manager for the U.S. Senator Joseph S. Clark of Pennsylvania, who was running for reelection to a third term. Clark ultimately lost the race to Richard Schweiker, a moderate Republican. Michener later served as Secretary for the 1967–1968 Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention. Also that year, Michener was a member of the Electoral College, serving as a Pennsylvania Democrat. He wrote about that experience in a political science text &quot;Presidential Lottery: The Reckless Gamble in Our Electoral System&quot;, which was published the following year. In it, he suggested alternate systems, including using a direct popular vote by majority for the office of President of the United States and other more creative solutions.

===Philanthropy===
Michener became a major philanthropist, donating more than $100 million to educational, cultural, and writing institutions, including his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Swarthmore College, the Iowa Writers Workshop, and the James A. Michener Art Museum, and more than $37 million to University of Texas at Austin. By 1992, his gifts made him UT Austin&#x27;s largest single donor to that time. Over the years, Mari Michener played a major role in helping direct his donations.

In 1989, Michener donated the royalty earnings from the Canadian edition of his novel &quot;Journey&quot; (1989), published in Canada by McClelland &amp; Stewart, to create the Journey Prize, an annual Canadian literary prize worth $10,000 (CDN) that is awarded for the year&#x27;s best short story published by an emerging Canadian writer.

In the Micheners&#x27; final years, he and his wife lived in Austin, Texas, and they endowed the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas at Austin. The Center provides three-year Michener Fellowships in fiction, poetry, playwriting and screenwriting to a small number of students.

==Death==
In October 1997, suffering from terminal kidney disease, Michener opted to end his daily dialysis treatment that had kept him alive for four years. He said he had accomplished what he wanted and did not want further physical complications. On October 16, 1997, he died of kidney failure, at age 90. Michener was cremated, and his ashes were placed next to those of his wife at Austin Memorial Park Cemetery in Austin, Texas. Michener is honored by a memorial headstone at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

===Bequests===
Michener left most of his estate and book copyrights to Swarthmore College, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree. He had donated his papers to the University of Northern Colorado, where he earned his master&#x27;s degree.

Many of the fondest memories of my travels stem back to my years of military service in the New Hebrides – (now Vanuatu) – during the Pacific War years of the early 1940s...While those beautiful islands have changed much with progress in the ensuing years, I know from subsequent visits that the friendliness of the peoples, their infectious smiles and their open-heartedness will remain forever one of life&#x27;s treasures.

The suite was officially christened by Steven J. Green, Ambassador of United States to Singapore.

===James A. Michener Art Museum===
Opened in 1988, in Michener&#x27;s hometown of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, the James A. Michener Art Museum houses collections of local and well-known artists. Michener pledged $5.5 million to the museum in 1996. Constructed from the remains of the old Bucks County Prison (replaced in 1985 with a larger, modern prison), the museum is a non-profit organization with both permanent and rotating collections. Two prominent permanent fixtures are the James A. Michener display room and the Nakashima Reading Room, constructed in honor of his third wife&#x27;s Japanese heritage. The museum is known for its permanent collection of Pennsylvania Impressionist paintings.

===James A. Michener Society===
The James A. Michener Society was formed in the fall of 1998. It comprises people who share a common interest and admirers of Michener&#x27;s life and work. The society sponsors a variety of activities and publishes an electronic internet newsletter. Annual meetings of members are held at locations closely associated with Michener&#x27;s life.
The society&#x27;s purpose is to:

<doc id="227127" wikidata="Q288181" url="?curid=227127" title="Alice chess">
<text>Alice chess is a chess variant invented in 1953 by V. R. Parton which employs two chessboards rather than one, and a slight (but significant) alteration to the standard rules of chess. The game is named after the main character &quot;Alice&quot; in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s work &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, where transport through the mirror into an alternative world is portrayed on the chessboards by the after-move transfer of chess pieces between boards A and B.

This simple transfer rule is well known for causing disorientation and confusion in players new to the game, often leading to surprises and amusing mistakes as pieces &quot;disappear&quot; and &quot;reappear&quot; between boards, and pieces interposed to block attacks on one board are simply bypassed on the other. This &quot;nothing is as it seems&quot; experience probably accounts for Alice chess remaining Parton&#x27;s most popular and successful variant among the numerous others he invented.
==Move rules==
At the beginning of the game, pieces start in their normal positions on board A, while board B starts empty. At each turn, a player can choose whether to move on board A or B. Pieces move the same as they do in standard chess, but, at the completion of its move, a piece goes &quot;through the looking-glass&quot;, transferring to the corresponding square on the opposite board. This simple change has dramatic impact on gameplay.
For example, after the opening moves 1. Nf3 e6, the white knight and black pawn transfer after moving on board A to their corresponding squares on board B. If the game continued 2. Ne5 Bc5, the knight returns to board A and the bishop finishes on board B (see diagram).

A move in Alice chess has two basic stipulations: the move must be legal on the board on which it is played, and the square transferred to on the opposite board must be vacant. Consequently, a piece can capture only on the board upon which it currently stands; it then transfers to the opposite board, as for a non-capturing move.
To demonstrate, if the above game continued 3. Nxf7, the knight transfers to board B. Then with Black to move, both 3...Kxf7 and 3...Bxf2+ are not possible. Black cannot play 3...Qd4 either, since the queen may not hop over the pawn on d7. But the move 3... Bg1 &quot;is&quot; possible (see diagram), even a white pawn is on f2 on board A. (The bishop move on board B is legal, and the square transferred to, g1 on board A, is vacant.)

While making a move on the first board, the player is allowed to remain in check on the second board, if the transferred piece then interposes to block the check.

A player must not be in check on the first board after making the move but before the transfer; thus the king cannot transfer out of check.

A player must also not be in check on either board after the transfer; thus they must not put themself in discovered check on the first board by making the transfer, and the king cannot transfer into check on the second board.

Castling is largely regarded as permitted in Alice chess; both king and rook would then transfer to the second board.

The &quot;en passant&quot; capture is normally excluded, but it can be included. In most such games, the target square is considered to be the square passed over on the first board, though opinions differ.

==Early mates==

===Fool&#x27;s mate===
Several exist; one is as follows: 1. e4 d5 2. Be2 dxe4 3. Bb5 (see diagram).

At first glance, it might seem that Black can simply interpose a piece between White&#x27;s bishop and his king to block the check (for example, 3...Bd7 or 3...Nc6 or 3...c6). But any piece so interposed immediately &quot;disappears&quot; when it transfers to board B. And Black cannot escape check by fleeing to the opposite board via 3...Kd7, because the move is not a legal move on board A. Therefore, it is checkmate.

Another form of fool&#x27;s mate: 1. e4 d6 2. Bc4 Qxd2? 3. Bb5#

And another: 1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 Nf6? 3. Qxe5#
===Scholar&#x27;s mate===
1. e4 h5 2. Be2 Rh4 3. Bxh5 Rxe4+ 4. Kf1 d5 5. Qe2? (threatening 6.Qb5#) 5... Bh3# (see diagram).

1. d4 e6 2. Qd6 Be7? 3. Qe5+ Kf8 4. Bh6# (Seitz–Nadvorney, 1973).
==Example game==
Paul Yearout vs. George Jelliss, 1996 AISE Grand Prix 

1. d3 Nf6 2. Nc3 c5 3. Qd2 Nc6 (To give a direct check to the king the checking piece must come from the other board, so it is necessary first to transfer forces to the other board.) 4. d4/A Rb8 (This way of developing rooks is common in Alice chess.) 5. e3 g5 (This prevents the Bc1 coming to g5 or f4.) 6. f4 Rbg8/A (Guarding Pg5 on the other board.) 7. Nd5/A h6 8. Nf3 gxf4/A (Inconsistent play on my part. Ne4/A now looks better to me.) 9. Bxf4 Rg4 10. Be5/A Rh5 11. 0-0-0 [diagram] (Perhaps judging that the activated black force now being on the second board the king might be safer there. The black queen is now effectively &#x27;pinned&#x27;: 11...Q–c7/b6 12.Qd8.) 11... Ne4/A 12. Bc7 Ra4/A 13. Ba6 Bg7 (The idea is 14...Rc4+ 15.c3/Nc3 Bxc3+/A.) 14. Bb5/A Rc4+ 15. Kb1/A Rf5/A 16. Ba5/A (Desperate measures now needed to save the &#x27;pinned&#x27; queen.) 16... Rxd5 17. Qxd5/A Qxa5 (Threatening 18...Qa1#.) 18. a3 Qd2/A 19. Qxd7+ Kf8 (I put these two moves in as an &#x27;if...then&#x27; clause, but it seems Paul may not have noticed the discovered check, so perhaps I should have kept quiet!) 20. Qxg7/A Qc3 (Stops Qh8#.) 21. Rd8/A (Black resigns. If 21...Bd7/Be6/Nf6 [then] 22.Qg8/Re8/Qh8#.)

==Variations==
Rule modifications have sprouted a number of variations of Alice chess.

===Looking glass Alice chess===

The black army starts out on the opposite board (board B).

===Ms. Alice chess===

&quot;Null&quot; or &quot;zero&quot; moves are permitted. (A move consisting of piece transfer only – from the current square a piece sits on, to the corresponding square, if vacant, on the opposite board.) A king cannot escape check with a zero move, and castling is denied if either king or rook have made a zero move. By John Ishkan (1973).

===O&#x27;Donohue chess===

Alice chess rules, except that a move is permitted even though the square normally transferred to on the opposite board is occupied. (In that case, the transfer portion of the move is omitted.) By Michael O&#x27;Donohue (2003).

===Duo chess===
Black starts out on board B; transfers are optional; non-pawn pieces may make &quot;zero&quot; moves (and may capture in so doing); a king is checked when an opposing piece sits on the king&#x27;s zero square; mate must cover the king&#x27;s ability to flee via a zero move. By Jed Stone (1981).

Parton also introduced a smaller, 8×4 version of Alice chess (see diagram). He also observed that Alice chess can be played using &quot;three&quot; boards instead of two. (Players then having a choice between two boards when transferring pieces.)

Alice chess rules can be adopted by practically any other chess variant too, by simply doubling the number of gameboards in the variant and applying the piece transfer policy (for example, Raumschach using two 5×5×5 boards).

<text>Alexander Carlyle MA DD FRSE (26 January 172228 August 1805) was a Scottish church leader, and autobiographer. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1770/71.

==Life==

He was born on 26 January 1722 in the manse at Cummertrees the son of Rev Willam Carlyle, the local minister. The family moved to Prestonpans in 1724. He was educated in Prestonpans then studied first at Edinburgh University then Glasgow before finalising his studies at Leyden University in the Netherlands which was famed for its teaching of Theology. He graduated MA from Edinburgh in 1743.

He was a witness to the aftermath of the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745 where he was part of the government militia, the Edinburgh Volunteers. He had spent the night in his father&#x27;s nearby manse, but missed the battle itself as it was over by the time he got dressed. He went to the assistance of the wounded on the battlefield, and found the officers of the Highland army &quot;gentleman-like and very civil.

He was licensed to preach as a Church of Scotland minister by the Presbytery of Prestonpans in July 1746. He was originally presented to the congregation of Cockburnspath but declined this role. In February 1748, under patronage of the Duke of Buccleuch, he was presented to the congregation of Inveresk and was formally ordained there in August 1748.
From 1748, until his death he was minister at Inveresk in Midlothian (south west of Prestonpans).

In 1756 he incurred the anger of the Presbytery of Dalkeith and the General Assembly for his involvement in the editing of John Home&#x27;s &quot;Douglas&quot; and in its theatre production in Edinburgh. He was present at its premiere on 15 December 1756.

During his long career he rose to high eminence in the Church of Scotland as leader of the moderate or &quot;broad&quot; Church section. This was recognised in an honorary Doctor of Divinity granted by King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen in 1760. In 1770 he succeeded Rev James MacKnight as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, being succeeded by Rev Robert Walker in 1771. In July 1785 he was made Dean of the Chapel Royal. In 1789 he was elected Principal Clerk of the General Assembly in opposition to Andrew Dalzell. He was associated with Principal Robertson as an ecclesiastical leader.

His strikingly ruddy complexion earned him the nickname of Jupiter Carlyle. His autobiography, which was edited by Hill Burton, and published 1860, though written in his closing years and not extending beyond the year 1770, is interesting as a picture of Scottish life, social and ecclesiastical, in the 18th century. 
Carlyle&#x27;s autobiography recalled the Porteous Riots of 1736, and his friendship with Adam Smith, David Hume, Charles Townshend and John Home, the dramatist, for witnessing the performance of whose tragedy &quot;Douglas&quot; he was censured in 1757. 
He was also a member of The Select Society and of The Poker Club.

He was a founder member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in November 1783.

He died on 25 August 1805 and was buried in Inveresk churchyard on 28 August.

==Family==

In October 1760 Alexander married Mary Roddam (1743-1804) daughter of Robert Roddam of Heathpool in Northumberland.

Their three daughters and one son each died young. On death Carlyle bequeathed his belongings to his nephew, Carlyle Bell.

<text>The Schottky diode (named after the German physicist Walter H. Schottky), also known as Schottky barrier diode or hot-carrier diode, is a semiconductor diode formed by the junction of a semiconductor with a metal. It has a low forward voltage drop and a very fast switching action. The cat&#x27;s-whisker detectors used in the early days of wireless and metal rectifiers used in early power applications can be considered primitive Schottky diodes.

When sufficient forward voltage is applied, a current flows in the forward direction. A silicon p–n diode has a typical forward voltage of 600–700 mV, while the Schottky&#x27;s forward voltage is 150–450 mV. This lower forward voltage requirement allows higher switching speeds and better system efficiency.

== Construction ==

A metal–semiconductor junction is formed between a metal and a semiconductor, creating a Schottky barrier (instead of a semiconductor–semiconductor junction as in conventional diodes). Typical metals used are molybdenum, platinum, chromium or tungsten, and certain silicides (e.g., palladium silicide and platinum silicide), whereas the semiconductor would typically be n-type silicon. The metal side acts as the anode, and n-type semiconductor acts as the cathode of the diode; meaning conventional current can flow from the metal side to the semiconductor side, but not in the opposite direction. This Schottky barrier results in both very fast switching and low forward voltage drop.

The choice of the combination of the metal and semiconductor determines the forward voltage of the diode. Both n- and p-type semiconductors can develop Schottky barriers. However, the p-type typically has a much lower forward voltage. As the reverse leakage current increases dramatically with lowering the forward voltage, it cannot be too low, so the usually employed range is about 0.15–0.45 V, and p-type semiconductors are employed only rarely. Titanium silicide and other refractory silicides, which are able to withstand the temperatures needed for source/drain annealing in CMOS processes, usually have too low a forward voltage to be useful, so processes using these silicides therefore usually do not offer Schottky diodes.

With increased doping of the semiconductor, the width of the depletion region drops. Below a certain width, the charge carriers can tunnel through the depletion region. At very high doping levels, the junction does not behave as a rectifier any more and becomes an ohmic contact. This can be used for the simultaneous formation of ohmic contacts and diodes, as a diode will form between the silicide and lightly doped n-type region, and an ohmic contact will form between the silicide and the heavily doped n- or p-type region. Lightly doped p-type regions pose a problem, as the resulting contact has too high a resistance for a good ohmic contact, but too low a forward voltage and too high a reverse leakage to make a good diode.

As the edges of the Schottky contact are fairly sharp, a high electric field occurs around them, which limits how large the reverse breakdown voltage threshold can be. Various strategies are used, from guard rings to overlaps of metallisation to reduce the field. The guard rings consume valuable die area and are used primarily for larger higher-voltage diodes, while overlapping metallization is employed primarily with smaller low-voltage diodes.

Schottky diodes are often used as antisaturation clamps in Schottky transistors. Schottky diodes made from palladium silicide (PdSi) are excellent due to their lower forward voltage (which has to be lower than the forward voltage of the base-collector junction). The Schottky temperature coefficient is lower than the coefficient of the B–C junction, which limits the use of PdSi at higher temperatures.

For power Schottky diodes, the parasitic resistances of the buried n+ layer and the epitaxial n-type layer become important. The resistance of the epitaxial layer is more important than it is for a transistor, as the current must cross its entire thickness. However, it serves as a distributed ballasting resistor over the entire area of the junction and, under usual conditions, prevents localized thermal runaway.

In comparison with the power p–n diodes, the Schottky diodes are less rugged. The junction is in direct contact with the thermally sensitive metallization; a Schottky diode can therefore dissipate less power than an equivalent-size p–n counterpart with a deep-buried junction before failing (especially during reverse breakdown). The relative advantage of the lower forward voltage of Schottky diodes is diminished at higher forward currents, where the voltage drop is dominated by the series resistance.

== Reverse recovery time ==
The most important difference between the p–n diode and the Schottky diode is the reverse recovery time (trr) when the diode switches from the conducting to the non-conducting state. In a p–n diode, the reverse recovery time can be in the order of several microseconds to less than 100 ns for fast diodes, and it is mainly limited by the diffusion capacitance caused by minority carriers accumulated in the diffusion region during the conducting state. Schottky diodes are significantly faster since they are unipolar devices and their speed is only limited by the junction capacitance. The switching time is ~100 ps for the small-signal diodes, and up to tens of nanoseconds for special high-capacity power diodes. With p–n-junction switching, there is also a reverse recovery current, which in high-power semiconductors brings increased EMI noise. With Schottky diodes, switching is essentially &quot;instantaneous&quot; with only a slight capacitive loading, which is much less of a concern.

This &quot;instantaneous&quot; switching is not always the case. In higher voltage Schottky devices, in particular, the guard ring structure needed to control breakdown field geometry creates a parasitic p–n diode with the usual recovery time attributes. As long as this guard ring diode is not forward biased, it adds only capacitance. If the Schottky junction is driven hard enough however, the forward voltage eventually will bias both diodes forward and actual will be greatly impacted.

It is often said that the Schottky diode is a &quot;majority carrier&quot; semiconductor device. This means that if the semiconductor body is a doped n-type, only the n-type carriers (mobile electrons) play a significant role in the normal operation of the device. The majority carriers are quickly injected into the conduction band of the metal contact on the other side of the diode to become free moving electrons. Therefore, no slow random recombination of n and p-type carriers is involved, so that this diode can cease conduction faster than an ordinary p–n rectifier diode. This property, in turn, allows a smaller device area, which also makes for a faster transition. This is another reason why Schottky diodes are useful in switch-mode power converters: the high speed of the diode means that the circuit can operate at frequencies in the range 200 kHz to 2 MHz, allowing the use of small inductors and capacitors with greater efficiency than would be possible with other diode types. Small-area Schottky diodes are the heart of RF detectors and mixers, which often operate at frequencies up to 50 GHz.

== Limitations ==
The most evident limitations of Schottky diodes are their relatively low reverse voltage ratings, and their relatively high reverse leakage current. For silicon-metal Schottky diodes, the reverse voltage is typically 50 V or less. Some higher-voltage designs are available (200 V is considered a high reverse voltage).
Reverse leakage current, since it increases with temperature, leads to a thermal instability issue. This often limits the useful reverse voltage to well below the actual rating.

While higher reverse voltages are achievable, they would present a higher forward voltage, comparable to other types of standard diodes. Such Schottky diodes would have no advantage unless great switching speed is required.

== Silicon carbide Schottky diode ==
Schottky diodes constructed from silicon carbide have a much lower reverse leakage current than silicon Schottky diodes, as well as higher forward voltage (about 1.4–1.8 V at 25 °C) and reverse voltage. they were available from manufacturers in variants up to 1700 V of reverse voltage.

Silicon carbide has a high thermal conductivity, and temperature has little influence on its switching and thermal characteristics. With special packaging, silicon carbide Schottky diodes can operate at junction temperatures of over 500 K (about 200 °C), which allows passive radiative cooling in aerospace applications.

== Applications ==

=== Voltage clamping ===
While standard silicon diodes have a forward voltage drop of about 0.7 V and germanium diodes 0.3 V, Schottky diodes&#x27; voltage drop at forward biases of around 1 mA is in the range of 0.15 V to 0.46 V (see the 1N5817 and 1N5711), which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. This is due to the higher current density in the Schottky diode.

=== Reverse current and discharge protection ===
The Schottky diode&#x27;s low forward voltage drop is good for energy-efficient applications, because little energy is wasted to heat. This makes them useful as &quot;blocking diodes&quot; in stand-alone (&quot;off-grid&quot;) photovoltaic (PV) systems which prevent batteries from discharging through the solar panels at night. They are also used in grid-connected systems with multiple strings connected in parallel, in order to prevent reverse current flowing from adjacent strings through shaded strings if the bypass diodes have failed.

=== Switched-mode power supplies ===
Schottky diodes are also used as rectifiers in switched-mode power supplies. The low forward voltage and fast recovery time leads to increased efficiency.

They can also be used in power supply &quot;OR&quot;ing circuits in products that have both an internal battery and a mains adapter input, or similar. However, the high reverse leakage current presents a problem in this case, as any high-impedance voltage sensing circuit (e.g., monitoring the battery voltage or detecting whether a mains adapter is present) will see the voltage from the other power source through the diode leakage.

=== Sample-and-hold circuits ===
Schottky diodes can be used in diode-bridge based sample and hold circuits. When compared to regular p–n junction based diode bridges, Schottky diodes can offer advantages. A forward-biased Schottky diode does not have any minority carrier charge storage. This allows them to switch more quickly than regular diodes, resulting in lower transition time from the sample to the hold step. 
The absence of minority carrier charge storage also results in a lower hold step or sampling error, resulting in a more accurate sample at the output.

=== Charge control ===
Due to its efficient electric field control, Schottky diodes can be used to accurately load or unload single electrons in semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum wells or quantum dots.

== Designation ==
Commonly encountered Schottky diodes include the 1N58xx series rectifiers, such as the 1N581x (1 A) and 1N582x (3 A) through-hole parts, and the SS1x (1 A) and SS3x (3 A) surface-mount parts. Schottky rectifiers are available in numerous surface-mount package styles.

Small-signal Schottky diodes such as the 1N5711, 1N6263, 1SS106, 1SS108, and the BAT41–43, 45–49 series are widely used in high-frequency applications as detectors, mixers and nonlinear elements, and have superseded germanium diodes. They are also suitable for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection of sensitive devices such as III-V-semiconductor devices, laser diodes and, to a lesser extent, exposed lines of CMOS circuitry.

Schottky metal–semiconductor junctions are featured in the successors to the 7400 TTL family of logic devices, the 74S, 74LS and 74ALS series, where they are employed as Baker clamps in parallel with the collector-base junctions of the bipolar transistors to prevent their saturation, thereby greatly reducing their turn-off delays.

== Alternatives ==
When less power dissipation is desired, a MOSFET and a control circuit can be used instead, in an operation mode known as active rectification.

A super diode, consisting of a pn-diode or Schottky diode and an operational amplifier, provides an almost perfect diode characteristic due to the effect of negative feedback, although its use is restricted to frequencies the operational amplifier used can handle.

==Electrowetting==
Electrowetting can be observed when a Schottky diode is formed using a droplet of liquid metal, e.g. mercury, in contact with a semiconductor, e.g. silicon. Depending on the doping type and density in the semiconductor, the droplet spreading depends on the magnitude and sign of the voltage applied to the mercury droplet. This effect has been termed ‘Schottky electrowetting’.

<doc id="227131" wikidata="Q75782" url="?curid=227131" title="Nicolaus Otto">
<text>Nicolaus August Otto (10 June 1832 – 26 January 1891) was a German engineer who successfully developed the compressed charge internal combustion engine which ran on petroleum gas and led to the modern internal combustion engine. The Association of German Engineers (VDI) created DIN standard 1940 which says &quot;Otto Engine: internal combustion engine in which the ignition of the compressed fuel-air mixture is initiated by a timed spark&quot;, which has been applied to all engines of this type since.

==Biography==

Nicolaus August Otto was born on 10 June 1832 in Holzhausen an der Haide, Germany. He was the youngest of six children. His father died in 1832. He began school in 1838. After six years of good performance he moved to the high school in Langenschwalbach until 1848. He did not complete his studies but was cited for good performance.

His main interest in school had been in science and technology but he graduated after three years as a business apprentice in a small merchandise company. After completing his apprenticeship he moved to Frankfurt where he worked for Philipp Jakob Lindheimer as a salesman of colonial goods and agricultural products (he was a grocery salesman). Otto worked for various companies, first for IC Alpeter and then in 1860 for Carl Mertens. He traveled throughout Western Germany and sold colonial goods—coffee, tea, rice, and sugar.

==Lenoir engine== 
In late autumn of 1860 Otto and his brother learned of a novel gas (illuminating gas) engine that Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir had built in Paris. The brothers built a copy of the Lenoir engine and applied for a patent in January 1861 for a liquid fueled engine based on the Lenoir (Gas) engine with the Prussian Ministry of Commerce, but it was rejected.

==First four stroke engine, 1861==
Otto was aware of the concept of compressed fuel charge and tried to make an engine using this principle in 1861. It ran for just a few minutes before breaking. Otto&#x27;s brother gave up on the concept, resulting in Otto looking for help elsewhere.

From 1862 to 1863 Otto experimented with the help of Cologne Mechanic Michael J. Zons in an effort to improve the engine. Running low on funds, in 1862 Otto worked for Carl Mertens in order to continue work on his engine.

==Partnership with Eugen Langen==
Early in 1864, Otto sought investors to fund his research. He found Eugen Langen, whose father was a sugar industrialist. Together they entered into a partnership on 31 March 1864 and named it NA Otto &amp; Cie in Cologne. This was the world&#x27;s first company focused entirely on the design and production of internal combustion engines.

The 1864 Otto &amp; Langen engine was a free piston atmospheric engine (the explosion of gas was used to create a vacuum and the power came from atmospheric pressure returning the piston). It consumed less than half the gas of the Lenoir and Hugon atmospheric engines and so was a commercial success. The Lenoir engine was a double acting engine. In essence these engines are a steam engine altered to run on illuminating gas. The engines of Italian inventors Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci in their British Patent no 1625 of 1857, were built and are in a museum. Unlike Otto&#x27;s engine these are two stroke atmospheric engines which are not in any way comparable.

For all its commercial success, with the company producing 634 engines a year by 1875, the Otto and Langen engine had hit a technical dead end as an atmospheric engine: it produced only , yet required headroom to operate.

Otto turned his attention to the four stroke cycle at which he had failed in 1862. Largely due to the efforts of Franz Rings and Herman Schumm, who were brought into the company by Gottlieb Daimler Otto succeeded in making the Four Stroke, Compressed Charge engine. It is this engine (the Otto Silent Engine), and not the Otto &amp; Langen engine, to which the &quot;Otto cycle&quot; refers. This was the first commercially successful engine to use in-cylinder compression. The Rings-Schumm engine appeared in autumn 1876 and was immediately successful.

In summary, the Otto engine which is the predecessor of the modern engine as specified by the VDI is Otto&#x27;s fourth design. He built the following engines:
*1861: a copy of Lenoir&#x27;s atmospheric engine
*1862: a four cycle compressed charge engine (prior to Rochas&#x27;s patent) which failed as it broke almost immediately
*1864: the first successful atmospheric engine
*1876: the four stroke compressed charge engine which is acknowledged as the &quot;Otto&quot; cycle engine. The term &quot;Otto cycle&quot; is applied to all compressed charge, four cycle engines.

Otto married Anna Gossi and the couple had seven recorded children. His son Gustav Otto grew up to become an aircraft builder.

==The Otto cycle==

The Otto engine was designed as a stationary engine and in the action of the engine, the stroke is an upward or downward movement of a piston in a cylinder. Used later in an adapted form as an automobile engine, four strokes are involved:

*(1) downward &quot;intake&quot; stroke—coal-gas and air enter the piston combustion chamber, 
*(2) upward &quot;compression&quot; stroke—the piston compresses the mixture, 
*(3) downward &quot;power&quot; stroke—ignites the fuel mixture by flame and later electric spark, 
*(4) upward &quot;exhaust&quot; stroke—releases exhaust gas from the piston chamber.

Otto only sold his engine as a stationary motor.

==Earlier patents==
Otto had obtained many patents from several different nations and for several different features. When his former manager Gottlieb Daimler wanted to build small engines for transportation Otto showed no interest. Daimler left and took Maybach with him. Daimler had no desire to pay royalties to Otto (Deutz AG) and so hired a lawyer to find a solution. What the lawyer found was a patent for the concept of a four cycle engine that had been issued to Beau De Rochas, a French engineer, in 1862. This resulted in Otto losing one of his patents and allowed Daimler to sell his engines in Germany without paying royalties. Neither Otto nor Daimler were aware of the Rochas patent. Rochas never built an engine. It is likely he could not have done so.

Several of the inventions that are sometimes mentioned as having preceded the Otto engine, such as Marcus, Barsanti, etc. are for two cycle (two stroke) atmospheric engines which do not compress the fuel charge. Otto&#x27;s atmospheric engine is not the VDI (and other associations) Otto engine type. The only significant engines were those from Lenoir. His engines were the first to go into serial production. Lenoir eventually sold approximately 700 engines.

==Production==
Over 50,000 engines were produced in the 17 years following introduction.

==Honors==
Otto received numerous honors for his engines. 
*The 1864 atmospheric engine won the gold medal in the 1867 World Exhibition in Paris.
*In 1882 Otto received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Würzburg.
*His home has been turned into a museum which is promoted by the local government.
*In 1936 Professor Nagël, head of the Association of German Engineers, decreed that DIN Standard 1940 specify that &quot;Ottomotor&quot; applies to all engines that draw in a fuel mix, compress it and ignite it by special device, thus replacing the terms such terms as &quot;explosion motor&quot;, &quot;detonation engine&quot;, &quot;benzine engine&quot;, and &quot;ignition engine.&quot;

<text>Jan Havickszoon Steen ( – buried 3 February 1679) was a Dutch Golden Age painter, one of the leading genre painters of the 17th century. His works are known for their psychological insight, sense of humour and abundance of colour.

==Life==



Steen was born in Leiden, a town in Southern Holland, where his well-to-do, Catholic family were brewers who ran the tavern &quot;The Red Halbert&quot; for two generations. Steen&#x27;s father even leased him a brewery of his own in Delft from the years 1654 until 1657. He was the eldest of eight or more children. Like his even more famous contemporary Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen attended the Latin school and became a student in Leiden. Though no official records of Steen&#x27;s artistic training are preserved, contemporary sources tell us he received his painterly education from three men, Nicolaes Knupfer (1603–1660), a German painter of historical and figurative scenes in Utrecht, Adriaen van Ostade, and Jan van Goyen, who would later become his father-in-law. Influences of Knupfer can be found in Steen&#x27;s use of composition and colour. Another source of inspiration was Isaac van Ostade, a painter of rural scenes, who lived in Haarlem.

In 1648 Jan Steen and Gabriël Metsu founded the painters&#x27; Guild of Saint Luke at Leiden. Soon after he became an assistant to the renowned landscape painter Jan van Goyen (1596–1656), and moved into his house on the Bierkade in The Hague. On 3 October 1649, he married van Goyen&#x27;s daughter Margriet, with whom he would have eight children. Steen worked with his father-in-law until 1654, when he moved to Delft, where he ran the brewery &quot;De Slang&quot; (&quot;The Snake&quot;) for three years without much success. After the explosion in Delft in 1654 the art market was depressed, but Steen painted &quot;A Burgomaster of Delft and his daughter&quot;. It does not seem to be clear if this painting should be called a portrait or a genre work.

Steen lived in Warmond, just north of Leiden, from 1656 until 1660 and in Haarlem from 1660 until 1670 and in both periods he was especially productive. In 1670, after the death of his wife in 1669 and his father in 1670, Steen moved back to Leiden, where he stayed the rest of his life. When the art market collapsed in 1672, called the Year of Disaster, Steen opened a tavern. In April 1673 he married Maria van Egmont, who gave him another child. In 1674 he became president of the Saint Luke&#x27;s Guild. Frans van Mieris (1635–1681) became one of his drinking companions. He died in Leiden in 1679 and was interred in a family grave in the Pieterskerk.

==Influences==

===Connection with the &quot;Rederijkers&quot;===

In 1945, Sturla Gudlaugsson, a specialist in Dutch seventeenth-century painting and iconography and Director of the Netherlands Institute for Art History and the Mauritshuis in The Hague, wrote &quot;The Comedians in the work of Jan Steen and his Contemporaries&quot;, which revealed that a major influence on Jan Steen&#x27;s work was the guild of the Rhetoricians or &quot;Rederijkers&quot; and their theatrical endeavors.

It is often suggested that Jan Steen&#x27;s paintings are a realistic portrayal of Dutch 17th-century life. However, not everything he did was a purely realistic representation of his day-to-day environment. Many of his scenes contain idyllic and bucolic fantasies and a declamatory emphasis redolent of theater.

Jan Steen&#x27;s connection to theater is easily verifiable through his connection to the &quot;Rederijkers&quot;. There are two kinds of evidence for this connection. First, Jan Steen Steen&#x27;s uncle belonged to the Rhetoricians in Leiden, where Steen was born and lived a substantial part of his life. Second, Jan Steen portrayed many scenes from the lives of the &quot;Rederijkers&quot;, an example being the painting &quot;Rhetoricians at a Window&quot; of 1658–1665. The piece is currently held in the Philadelphia Museum of Art which was established in February 1876. The humanity, humour and optimism of the figures suggest that Jan Steen knew these men well, and wanted to portray them positively.

===Theater===
With his lavish and moralising style, it is logical that Steen would employ the stratagems from theater for his purposes. There is conclusive evidence that the characters in Steen&#x27;s paintings are predominantly theatrical characters and not ones from reality.

Steen&#x27;s numerous paintings of a theme most commonly entitled &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Visit&quot;, such as the composition of 1665–1670 in the Rijksmuseum, illustrate his theatrical approach. The story is simple: a doctor attending a young maiden discovers that she is not ill but is in fact pregnant with child. The doctor is a comical character who wears a biretta, a doublet and a small pleated ruff. In fact, he is dressed in the fashion of 1570, not 1670. In contrast, the girl wears what would be the height of fashion at the time of the painting, a Japanese-styled loose kimono robe. 
This anachronism can be explained only one way: this is not a real doctor but an actor wearing a traditional theater costume. According to Gudlaugsson, &quot;never would so unusual and so completely uncontemporary a costume occur as that of the doctors in [Steen&#x27;s] work&quot;.

==Works==

Daily life was Jan Steen&#x27;s main pictorial theme. Many of the genre scenes he portrayed, as in &quot;The Feast of Saint Nicholas&quot;, are lively to the point of chaos and lustfulness, even so much that &quot;a Jan Steen household&quot;, meaning a messy scene, became a Dutch proverb (&quot;een huishouden van Jan Steen&quot;). Subtle hints in his paintings seem to suggest that Steen meant to warn the viewer rather than invite him to copy this behaviour. Many of Steen&#x27;s paintings bear references to old Dutch proverbs or literature. He often used members of his family as models, and painted quite a few self-portraits in which he showed no tendency to vanity. Jan Steen’s works followed the theme &quot;every painter paints himself&quot;, depicting lively scenes reminiscent of his own home. This insertion of personal narratives in his work inspired the creation of a Dutch proverb still in use today, called &quot;A Jan Steen household&quot; which references a home that reflects the chaotic, lively nature of the households Steen’s work displayed.

Steen did not shy from other themes: he painted historical, mythological and religious scenes, portraits, still lifes and natural scenes. His portraits of children are famous. He is also well known for his mastery of light and attention to detail, most notably in Persian rugs and other textiles.

Steen was prolific, producing about 800 paintings, of which roughly 350 survive. His work was valued much by contemporaries and as a result he was reasonably well paid for his work. He did not have many students—only Richard Brakenburgh is recorded—but his work proved a source of inspiration for many painters.

In the two paintings, &quot;The way you hear it&quot; and &quot;As old men sing, so children squeal,&quot; six of the people are identical in person and pose, and their spatial relationship is similar.

<text>Robert Barry Dickey (November 10, 1811 – July 14, 1903) was a participant in the conferences leading to the Canadian Confederation of 1867 and is therefore considered to be one of the Fathers of Confederation.

Born in Amherst, the son of Robert McGowan Dickey and Eleanor Chapman, he was educated at Windsor Academy and later studied law with Alexander Stewart. He was called to the Nova Scotia bar in 1834, and to the New Brunswick bar in 1835. He was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1863. He served as both judge and registrar of probate in Cumberland County for 20 years. In 1844, he married Mary Blair, one of Alexander Stewart&#x27;s daughters. Dickey was a director of the Nova Scotia Electric Telegraph Company and consular agent for the United States at Amherst.

From 1858 to 1867, Dickey was appointed to the Legislative Council of Nova Scotia. In 1867, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of Amherst, Nova Scotia. A Conservative, he served until his death in 1903.

His son Arthur Rupert Dickey served as a member of the House of Commons.

His daughter Mary married the English landscape architect Henry Ernest Milner.
