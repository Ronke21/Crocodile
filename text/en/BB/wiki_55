<doc id="234136" wikidata="Q887210" url="?curid=234136" title="List of governors of Delaware">
<text>The governor of Delaware (known as the president of Delaware from 1776 to 1792) is the head of government of Delaware and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Delaware Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment, and only with the recommendation of the Board of Pardons.

There have been 71 people who have served as governor, over 74 distinct terms. Three (Joseph Haslet, Charles Polk Jr. and Elbert N. Carvel) served non-consecutive terms. Additionally, Henry Molleston was elected, but died before he could take office. Only four governors have been elected to two consecutive terms, with the longest-serving being Ruth Ann Minner, who was elected twice after succeeding to the office, serving a total of just over eight years. The shortest term is that of Bethany Hall-Long, who served 15 days following her predecessor&#x27;s resignation; Dale E. Wolf served 18 days and David P. Buckson served 19 days under similar circumstances. The current governor is Democrat Matt Meyer, who took office on January 21, 2025.

==Governors==
Before 1776, Delaware was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain, administered by colonial governors in Pennsylvania as the &quot;Lower Counties on Delaware&quot;.

In 1776, soon after Delaware and the other Thirteen Colonies declared independence from Britain, the state adopted its first state constitution. It created the office of President of Delaware, a chief executive to be chosen by the legislature to serve a term of three years, who would be ineligible to be president again until three years had passed after leaving office.

The office of President was renamed Governor by the constitution of 1792, which set the commencement date of the term to the third Tuesday in the January following an election, and limited governors to serving only three out of any six years. The term was lengthened to four years by the 1831 constitution, but governors were limited to a single term. The current constitution of 1897 allows governors to serve two terms.

The 1776 constitution stated that if the presidency were vacant, the speaker of the legislative council would be a vice-president. The 1792 constitution has the speaker of the senate exercising the office when it is vacant, and the 1897 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, upon whom the office devolves in case of vacancy. The offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected at the same time but not on the same ticket.

<text>Economies of scope are &quot;efficiencies formed by variety, not volume&quot; (the latter concept is &quot;economies of scale&quot;). In the field of economics, &quot;economies&quot; is synonymous with cost savings and &quot;scope&quot; is synonymous with broadening production/services through diversified products. Economies of scope is an economic theory stating that average total cost (ATC) of production decrease as a result of increasing the number of different goods produced. For example, a gas station primarily sells gasoline, but can sell soda, milk, baked goods, etc. and thus achieve economies of scope since with the same facility, each new product attracts new dollars a customer would have spent elsewhere. The business historian Alfred Chandler argued that economies of scope contributed to the rise of American business corporations during the 20th century. 

==Economics==
The term and the development of the concept are attributed to economists John C. Panzar and Robert D. Willig (1977, 1981). Their 1981 article notes that they had coined the term several years previously, and felt that its logic was &quot;intuitively appealing&quot;.

Whereas economies of scale for a firm involve reductions in the average cost (cost per unit) arising from increasing the scale of production for a single product type, economies of scope involve lowering average cost by producing more types of products. Hofstrand notes that the two types of economy &quot;are not mutually exclusive&quot;.

Economies of scope make product diversification efficient, as part of the Ansoff Matrix, if they are based on the common and recurrent use of proprietary know-how or on an indivisible physical asset. For example, as the number of products promoted is increased, more people can be reached per unit of money spent. At some point, however, additional advertising expenditure on new products may become less effective (an example of the opposite effect, diseconomies of scope). Related examples include distribution of different types of products, product bundling, product lining, and family branding.

Economies of scope exist whenever the total cost of producing two different products or services (X and Y) is lower when a single firm instead of two separate firms produces by themselves.

:formula_1

The degree of economies of scope (DSC) formula is as follows:

:formula_2

If formula_3, there are economies of scope. It is recommended that two firms cooperate, or systems merge, to produce together.

If formula_4, there are no economies of scale nor economies of scope.

If formula_5, there are diseconomies of scope. It is not recommended for the two firms to work together. Diseconomies of scope means that it is more efficient for two firms to work separately since the merged cost per unit is higher than the sum of stand-alone costs.

For a company, if it wants to achieve diversity, the economy of scope is related to resource, and it is similar to resource requirements between enterprises. Relevance supports the economy by improving the applicability of resources in the merged companies and supporting the economical use of resources (such as employees, factories, technical and marketing knowledge) in these companies.

Unlike economies of scale, &quot;which can be reasonably be expected to plateau into an efficient state that will then deliver high-margin revenues for a period&quot;, economies of scope may never reach that plateau, or point at all. As Venkatesh Rao of Ribbonfarm explains it, &quot;You may never get to a point where you can claim you have right-sized and right-shaped the business, but you have to keep trying. In fact, managing the ongoing scope-learning process is the essential activity in business strategy. If you ever think you’ve right-sized/right-shaped for the steady state, that’s when you are most vulnerable to attacks.&quot;

Research and development (R&amp;D) is a typical example of economies of scope. In R&amp;D economies, unit cost decreases because of the spreading R&amp;D expenses. For example, R&amp;D labs require a minimum number of scientists and researchers whose labour is indivisible. Therefore, when the output of the lab increases, R&amp;D costs per unit may decrease. The substantial indivisible invest in R&amp;D may also implies that average fixed costs will fall rapidly due to the output and sales increase. The ideas from one project can help another project (positive spillovers).

Strategic fit, also known as complementarity that yields economies of scope, is the degree to which, or what kind of activities of different sections of an entrepreneur corporates with each other that complement themselves to achieve competitive advantage. Throughout the strategic fit, diversified firms can merge with interrelated businesses and share the resources. These kind of corporations can limit the duplication of research and developments, provide a more planned and developed selling pipelines for businesses.

=== Joint costs ===
The essential reason for economies of scope is some substantial joint cost across the production of multiple products. The cost of a cable network underlies economies of scope across the provision of broadband service and cable TV. The cost of operating a plane is a joint cost between carrying passengers and carrying freight, and underlies economies of scope across passenger and freight services.

=== Natural monopolies ===
While in the single-output case, economies of scale are a sufficient condition for the verification of a natural monopoly, in the multi-output case, they are not sufficient. Economies of scope are, however, a necessary condition. As a matter of simplification, it is generally accepted that markets may have monopoly features if both economies of scale and economies of scope apply, as well as sunk costs or other barriers to entry.

===Empirical Evidence===
In a 2022 article in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;, researchers used data from the Indian manufacturing sector to estimate the economies of scope arising from factor-biased productivities that are jointly used across product lines. They found that economies of scope are important determinants of product market entry, and that they change entry probabilities by several percentage points.

==Examples==
Economies of scope arise when businesses share centralized functions (such as finance or marketing) or when they form interrelationships at other points in the business process (e.g., cross-selling one product alongside another, using the outputs of one business as the inputs of another).

Economies of scope served as the impetus behind the formation of large international conglomerates in the 1970s and 1980s, such as BTR and Hanson in the UK and ITT in the United States. These companies sought to apply their financial skills across a more diverse range of industries through economies of scope. In the 1990s, several conglomerates that &quot;relied on cross-selling, thus reaping economies of scope by using the same people and systems to market many different products&quot;—i.e., &quot;selling the financial products of the one by using the sales teams of the other&quot;—which was the logic behind the 1998 merger of Travelers Group and Citicorp.

The application of information technology to manufacturing has allowed processes to become more flexible and generated more opportunities for economies of scope than were possible with older forms of technology, when equipment tended towards greater specialization in how it could be used. Goldhar and Jelinek argue that the use of computers in manufacturing generates economies of scale via the following capabilities: 

*extreme flexibility in product design and product mix
*rapid responses to changes in market demand, product design and mix, output rates, and equipment scheduling
*greater control, accuracy, and repeatability of processes
*reduced costs from less waste and lower training and changeover costs
*more predictability (e.g., maintenance costs)
*faster throughput thanks to better machine use, less in-process inventory, or fewer stoppages for missing or broken parts:
* distributed processing capability made possible and economical by the encoding of process information in easily replicable software
*reduction in risk: a company that sells many product lines, sells in many countries, or both will benefit from reduced risk (e.g., if a product line falls out of fashion or if one country has an economic slowdown, the company will likely be able to continue trading).

Goldhar and Jellinek note that higher machine speeds are now both possible and economically feasible due to the sensory and control capabilities of &quot;smart&quot; machines and the information management capabilities of computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software.

3D printing is another area which can generate economies of scope, as it is an example of the same equipment producing &quot;multiple products more cheaply in combination than separately&quot;.

If a sales team sells several products, it can often do so more efficiently than if it is selling only one product because the cost of travel would be distributed over a greater revenue base, thus improving cost efficiency. There can also be synergies between products such that offering a range of products gives the consumer a more desirable product offering than would a single product. Economies of scope can also operate through distribution efficiencies—i.e. it can be more efficient to ship to any given location a range of products than a single type of product.

Further economies of scope occur when there are cost savings arising from byproducts in the production process, such as when the benefits of heating from energy production has a positive effect on agricultural yields.

<text>In computer science, a concern is a particular set of information that has an effect on the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as the details of database interaction or as specific as performing a primitive calculation, depending on the level of conversation between developers and the program being discussed. IBM uses the term &quot;concern space&quot; to describe the sectioning of conceptual information.

==Overview==
Usually the code can be separated into logical sections, each addressing separate concerns, and so it hides the need for a given section to know particular information addressed by a different section. This leads to a modular program. Edsger W. Dijkstra coined the term &quot;separation of concerns&quot; to describe the mentality behind this modularization, which allows the programmer to reduce the complexity of the system being designed. Two different concerns that intermingle in the same section of code are called &quot;highly coupled&quot;. Sometimes the chosen module divisions do not allow for one concern to be completely separated from another, resulting in cross-cutting concerns. The various programming paradigms address the issue of cross-cutting concerns to different degrees. Data logging is a common cross-cutting concern, being used in many other parts of the program other than the particular module(s) that actually log the data. Since changes to the logging code can affect other sections, it could introduce bugs in the operation of the program.

Paradigms that specifically address the issue of concern separation:

* Object-oriented programming, describing concerns as objects
* Functional programming, describing concerns as functions
* Aspect-oriented software development, treating concerns and their interaction as constructs of their own standing

<text>Seagrasses are the only flowering plants which grow in marine environments. There are about 60 species of fully marine seagrasses which belong to four families (Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae and Cymodoceaceae), all in the order Alismatales (in the clade of monocotyledons). Seagrasses evolved from terrestrial plants which recolonised the ocean 70 to 100 million years ago.

The name &quot;seagrass&quot; stems from the many species with long and narrow leaves, which grow by rhizome extension and often spread across large &quot;meadows&quot; resembling grassland; many species superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family Poaceae.

Like all autotrophic plants, seagrasses photosynthesize, in the submerged photic zone, and most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms. Most species undergo submarine pollination and complete their life cycle underwater. While it was previously believed this pollination was carried out without pollinators and purely by sea current drift, this has been shown to be false for at least one species, &quot;Thalassia testudinum&quot;, which carries out a mixed biotic-abiotic strategy. Crustaceans (such as crabs, &quot;Majidae zoae&quot;, &quot;Thalassinidea zoea&quot;) and syllid polychaete worm larvae have both been found with pollen grains, the plant producing nutritious mucigenous clumps of pollen to attract and stick to them instead of nectar as terrestrial flowers do.

Seagrasses form dense underwater seagrass meadows which are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. They function as important carbon sinks and provide habitats and food for a diversity of marine life comparable to that of coral reefs.

==Overview==
Seagrasses are a paraphyletic group of marine angiosperms which evolved in parallel three to four times from land plants back to the sea. The following characteristics can be used to define a seagrass species:

* It lives in an estuarine or in the marine environment, and nowhere else.
* The pollination takes place underwater with specialized pollen.
* The seeds which are dispersed by both biotic and abiotic agents are produced underwater. 
* The seagrass species have specialized leaves with a reduced cuticle, an epidermis which lacks stomata and is the main photosynthetic tissue.
* The rhizome or underground stem is important in anchoring.
* The roots can live in an anoxic environment and depend on oxygen transport from the leaves and rhizomes but are also important in the nutrient transfer processes.

Seagrasses profoundly influence the physical, chemical, and biological environments of coastal waters. Though seagrasses provide invaluable ecosystem services by acting as breeding and nursery ground for a variety of organisms and promote commercial fisheries, many aspects of their physiology are not well investigated. There are 26 species of seagrasses in North American coastal waters. Several studies have indicated that seagrass habitat is declining worldwide. Ten seagrass species are at elevated risk of extinction (14% of all seagrass species) with three species qualifying as endangered. Seagrass loss and degradation of seagrass biodiversity will have serious repercussions for marine biodiversity and the human population that depends upon the resources and ecosystem services that seagrasses provide.

Seagrasses form important coastal ecosystems. The worldwide endangering of these sea meadows, which provide food and habitat for many marine species, prompts the need for protection and understanding of these valuable resources.

==Evolution==
Around 140 million years ago, seagrasses evolved from early monocots which succeeded in conquering the marine environment. Monocots are grass and grass-like flowering plants (angiosperms), the seeds of which typically contain only one embryonic leaf or cotyledon.

Terrestrial plants evolved perhaps as early as 450 million years ago from a group of green algae. Seagrasses then evolved from terrestrial plants which migrated back into the ocean. Between about 70 million and 100 million years ago, three independent seagrass lineages (Hydrocharitaceae, Cymodoceaceae complex, and Zosteraceae) evolved from a single lineage of the monocotyledonous flowering plants.

Other plants that colonised the sea, such as salt marsh plants, mangroves, and marine algae, have more diverse evolutionary lineages. In spite of their low species diversity, seagrasses have succeeded in colonising the continental shelves of all continents except Antarctica.

Recent sequencing of the genomes of &quot;Zostera marina&quot; and &quot;Zostera muelleri&quot; has given a better understanding of angiosperm adaptation to the sea. During the evolutionary step back to the ocean, different genes have been lost (e.g., stomatal genes) or have been reduced (e.g., genes involved in the synthesis of terpenoids) and others have been regained, such as in genes involved in sulfation.

Genome information has shown further that adaptation to the marine habitat was accomplished by radical changes in cell wall composition. However the cell walls of seagrasses are not well understood. In addition to the ancestral traits of land plants one would expect habitat-driven adaptation process to the new environment characterized by multiple abiotic (high amounts of salt) and biotic (different seagrass grazers and bacterial colonization) stressors. The cell walls of seagrasses seem intricate combinations of features known from both angiosperm land plants and marine macroalgae with new structural elements.

==Taxonomy==
Today, seagrasses are a polyphyletic group of marine angiosperms with around 60 species in five families (Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae, Posidoniaceae, Cymodoceaceae, and Ruppiaceae), which belong to the order Alismatales according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV System. The genus &quot;Ruppia&quot;, which occurs in brackish water, is not regarded as a &quot;real&quot; seagrass by all authors and has been shifted to the Cymodoceaceae by some authors. The APG IV system and The Plant List Webpage do not share this family assignment.

==Sexual recruitment==

Seagrass populations are currently threatened by a variety of anthropogenic stressors. The ability of seagrasses to cope with environmental perturbations depends, to some extent, on genetic variability, which is obtained through sexual recruitment. By forming new individuals, seagrasses increase their genetic diversity and thus their ability to colonise new areas and to adapt to environmental changes.

Seagrasses have contrasting colonisation strategies. Some seagrasses form seed banks of small seeds with hard pericarps that can remain in the dormancy stage for several months. These seagrasses are generally short-lived and can recover quickly from disturbances by not germinating far away from parent meadows (e.g., &quot;Halophila&quot; sp., &quot;Halodule&quot; sp., &quot;Cymodocea&quot; sp., &quot;Zostera&quot; sp. and &quot;Heterozostera&quot; sp.). In contrast, other seagrasses form dispersal propagules. This strategy is typical of long-lived seagrasses that can form buoyant fruits with inner large non-dormant seeds, such as the genera &quot;Posidonia&quot; sp., &quot;Enhalus&quot; sp. and &quot;Thalassia&quot; sp. Accordingly, the seeds of long-lived seagrasses have a large dispersal capacity compared to the seeds of the short-lived type, which permits the evolution of species beyond unfavourable light conditions by the seedling development of parent meadows.

The seagrass &quot;Posidonia oceanica&quot; (L.) Delile is one of the oldest and largest species on Earth. An individual can form meadows measuring nearly 15 km wide and can be hundreds to thousands of years old. &quot;P. oceanica&quot; meadows play important roles in the maintenance of the geomorphology of Mediterranean coasts, which, among others, makes this seagrass a priority habitat of conservation. Currently, the flowering and recruitment of &quot;P. oceanica&quot; seems to be more frequent than that expected in the past. Further, this seagrass has singular adaptations to increase its survival during recruitment. The large amounts of nutrient reserves contained in the seeds of this seagrass support shoot and root growth, even up to the first year of seedling development. In the first months of germination, when leaf development is scarce, &quot;P. oceanica&quot; seeds perform photosynthetic activity, which increases their photosynthetic rates and thus maximises seedling establishment success. Seedlings also show high morphological plasticity during their root system development by forming adhesive root hairs to help anchor themselves to rocky sediments. However, many factors about &quot;P. oceanica&quot; sexual recruitment remain unknown, such as when photosynthesis in seeds is active or how seeds can remain anchored to and persist on substrate until their root systems have completely developed.

==Intertidal and subtidal==
Seagrasses occurring in the intertidal and subtidal zones are exposed to highly variable environmental conditions due to tidal changes. Subtidal seagrasses are more frequently exposed to lower light conditions, driven by plethora of natural and human-caused influences that reduce light penetration by increasing the density of suspended opaque materials. Subtidal light conditions can be estimated, with high accuracy, using artificial intelligence, enabling more rapid mitigation than was available using &quot;in situ&quot; techniques. Seagrasses in the intertidal zone are regularly exposed to air and consequently experience extreme high and low temperatures, high photoinhibitory irradiance, and desiccation stress relative to subtidal seagrass. Such extreme temperatures can lead to significant seagrass dieback when seagrasses are exposed to air during low tide. Desiccation stress during low tide has been considered the primary factor limiting seagrass distribution at the upper intertidal zone. Seagrasses residing the intertidal zone are usually smaller than those in the subtidal zone to minimize the effects of emergence stress. Intertidal seagrasses also show light-dependent responses, such as decreased photosynthetic efficiency and increased photoprotection during periods of high irradiance and air exposure.

In contrast, seagrasses in the subtidal zone adapt to reduced light conditions caused by light attenuation and scattering due to the overlaying water column and suspended particles. Seagrasses in the deep subtidal zone generally have longer leaves and wider leaf blades than those in the shallow subtidal or intertidal zone, which allows more photosynthesis, in turn resulting in greater growth. Seagrasses also respond to reduced light conditions by increasing chlorophyll content and decreasing the chlorophyll a/b ratio to enhance light absorption efficiency by using the abundant wavelengths efficiently. As seagrasses in the intertidal and subtidal zones are under highly different light conditions, they exhibit distinctly different photoacclimatory responses to maximize photosynthetic activity and photoprotection from excess irradiance.

Seagrasses assimilate large amounts of inorganic carbon to achieve high level production. Marine macrophytes, including seagrass, use both and (bicarbonate) for photosynthetic carbon reduction. Despite air exposure during low tide, seagrasses in the intertidal zone can continue to photosynthesize utilizing CO2 in the air. Thus, the composition of inorganic carbon sources for seagrass photosynthesis probably varies between intertidal and subtidal plants. Because stable carbon isotope ratios of plant tissues change based on the inorganic carbon sources for photosynthesis, seagrasses in the intertidal and subtidal zones may have different stable carbon isotope ratio ranges.

==Seagrass meadows==


Seagrass beds/meadows can be either monospecific (made up of a single species) or in mixed beds. In temperate areas, usually one or a few species dominate (like the eelgrass &quot;Zostera marina&quot; in the North Atlantic), whereas tropical beds usually are more diverse, with up to thirteen species recorded in the Philippines.

Seagrass beds are diverse and productive ecosystems, and can harbor hundreds of associated species from all phyla, for example juvenile and adult fish, epiphytic and free-living macroalgae and microalgae, mollusks, bristle worms, and nematodes. Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass leaves (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific reviews and improved working methods have shown that seagrass herbivory is an important link in the food chain, feeding hundreds of species, including green turtles, dugongs, manatees, fish, geese, swans, sea urchins and crabs. Some fish species that visit/feed on seagrasses raise their young in adjacent mangroves or coral reefs.

Seagrasses trap sediment and slow down water movement, causing suspended sediment to settle out. Trapping sediment benefits coral by reducing sediment loads, improving photosynthesis for both coral and seagrass.

Although often overlooked, seagrasses provide a number of ecosystem services. Seagrasses are considered ecosystem engineers. This means that the plants alter the ecosystem around them. This adjusting occurs in both physical and chemical forms. Many seagrass species produce an extensive underground network of roots and rhizome which stabilizes sediment and reduces coastal erosion. This system also assists in oxygenating the sediment, providing a hospitable environment for sediment-dwelling organisms. Seagrasses also enhance water quality by stabilizing heavy metals, pollutants, and excess nutrients. The long blades of seagrasses slow the movement of water which reduces wave energy and offers further protection against coastal erosion and storm surge. Furthermore, because seagrasses are underwater plants, they produce significant amounts of oxygen which oxygenate the water column. These meadows account for more than 10% of the ocean&#x27;s total carbon storage. Per hectare, it holds twice as much carbon dioxide as rain forests and can sequester about 27.4 million tons of CO2 annually.

Seagrass meadows provide food for many marine herbivores. Sea turtles, manatees, parrotfish, surgeonfish, sea urchins and pinfish feed on seagrasses. Many other smaller animals feed on the epiphytes and invertebrates that live on and among seagrass blades. Seagrass meadows also provide physical habitat in areas that would otherwise be bare of any vegetation. Due to this three dimensional structure in the water column, many species occupy seagrass habitats for shelter and foraging. It is estimated that 17 species of coral reef fish spend their entire juvenile life stage solely on seagrass flats. These habitats also act as a nursery grounds for commercially and recreationally valued fishery species, including the gag grouper (&quot;Mycteroperca microlepis&quot;), red drum, common snook, and many others. Some fish species utilize seagrass meadows and various stages of the life cycle. In a recent publication, Dr. Ross Boucek and colleagues discovered that two highly sought after flats fish, the common snook and spotted sea trout provide essential foraging habitat during reproduction. Sexual reproduction is extremely energetically expensive to be completed with stored energy; therefore, they require seagrass meadows in close proximity to complete reproduction. Furthermore, many commercially important invertebrates also reside in seagrass habitats including bay scallops (&quot;Argopecten irradians&quot;), horseshoe crabs, and shrimp. Charismatic fauna can also be seen visiting the seagrass habitats. These species include West Indian manatee, green sea turtles, and various species of sharks. The high diversity of marine organisms that can be found on seagrass habitats promotes them as a tourist attraction and a significant source of income for many coastal economies along the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caribbean.

In 2022, scientists reported the discovery of the world’s largest known seagrass ecosystem, near the Bahamas. The discovery was made with the help of tiger sharks who between 2016 and 2022 were tagged with cameras so that scientists could see the ocean floor from a different perspective. 


==Seagrass microbiome==


===Seagrass holobiont===
The concept of the holobiont, which emphasizes the importance and interactions of a microbial host with associated microorganisms and viruses and describes their functioning as a single biological unit, has been investigated and discussed for many model systems, although there is substantial criticism of a concept that defines diverse host-microbe symbioses as a single biological unit. The holobiont and hologenome concepts have evolved since the original definition, and there is no doubt that symbiotic microorganisms are pivotal for the biology and ecology of the host by providing vitamins, energy and inorganic or organic nutrients, participating in defense mechanisms, or by driving the evolution of the host.

Although most work on host-microbe interactions has been focused on animal systems such as corals, sponges, or humans, there is a substantial body of literature on plant holobionts. Plant-associated microbial communities impact both key components of the fitness of plants, growth and survival, and are shaped by nutrient availability and plant defense mechanisms. Several habitats have been described to harbor plant-associated microbes, including the rhizoplane (surface of root tissue), the rhizosphere (periphery of the roots), the endosphere (inside plant tissue), and the phyllosphere (total above-ground surface area). The microbial community in the &quot;P. oceanica&quot; rhizosphere shows similar complexity as terrestrial habitats that contain thousands of taxa per gram of soil. In contrast, the chemistry in the rhizosphere of &quot;P. oceanica&quot; was dominated by the presence of sugars like sucrose and phenolics.

==Cell walls==

Seagrass cell walls contain the same polysaccharides found in angiosperm land plants, such as cellulose However, the cell walls of some seagrasses are characterised by sulfated polysaccharides, which is a common attribute of macroalgae from the groups of red, brown and also green algae. It was proposed in 2005 that the ability to synthesise sulfated polysaccharides was regained by marine angiosperms. Another unique feature of cell walls of seagrasses is the occurrence of unusual pectic polysaccharides called apiogalacturonans.

In addition to polysaccharides, glycoproteins of the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family, are important components of cell walls of land plants. The highly glycosylated arabinogalactan proteins are of interest because of their involvement in both wall architecture and cellular regulatory processes. Arabinogalactan proteins are ubiquitous in seed land plants and have also been found in ferns, lycophytes and mosses. They are structurally characterised by large polysaccharide moieties composed of arabinogalactans (normally over 90% of the molecule) which are covalently linked via hydroxyproline to relatively small protein/peptide backbones (normally less than 10% of the molecule). Distinct glycan modifications have been identified in different species and tissues and it has been suggested these influence physical properties and function. In 2020, AGPs were isolated and structurally characterised for the first time from a seagrass. Although the common backbone structure of land plant arabinogalactan proteins is conserved, the glycan structures exhibit unique features suggesting a role of seagrass arabinogalactan proteins in osmoregulation.

Further components of secondary walls of plants are cross-linked phenolic polymers called lignin, which are responsible for mechanical strengthening of the wall. In seagrasses, this polymer has also been detected, but often in lower amounts compared to angiosperm land plants. Thus, the cell walls of seagrasses seem to contain combinations of features known from both angiosperm land plants and marine macroalgae together with new structural elements. Dried seagrass leaves might be useful for papermaking or as insulating materials, so knowledge of cell wall composition has some technological relevance.

== Threats and conservation ==
Despite only covering 0.1 - 0.2% of the ocean’s surface, seagrasses form critically important ecosystems. Much like many other regions of the ocean, seagrasses have been faced with an accelerating global decline. Since the late 19th century, over 20% of the global seagrass area has been lost, with seagrass bed loss occurring at a rate of 1.5% each year. Of the 72 global seagrass species, approximately one quarter (15 species) could be considered at a Threatened or Near Threatened status on the IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species. Threats include a combination of natural factors, such as storms and disease, and anthropogenic in origin, including habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.

By far the most common threat to seagrass is human activity. Up to 67 species (93%) of seagrasses are affected by human activity along coastal regions. Activities such as coastal land development, motorboating, and fishing practices like trawling either physically destroy seagrass beds or increase turbidity in the water, causing seagrass die-off. Since seagrasses have some of the highest light requirements of angiosperm plant species, they are highly affected by environmental conditions that change water clarity and block light.

Seagrasses are also negatively affected by changing global climatic conditions. Increased weather events, sea level rise, and higher temperatures as a result of global warming all have the potential to induce widespread seagrass loss. An additional threat to seagrass beds is the introduction of non-native species. For seagrass beds worldwide, at least 28 non-native species have become established. Of these invasive species, the majority (64%) have been documented to infer negative effects on the ecosystem.

Another major cause of seagrass disappearance is coastal eutrophication. Rapidly developing human population density along coastlines has led to high nutrient loads in coastal waters from sewage and other impacts of development. Increased nutrient loads create an accelerating cascade of direct and indirect effects that lead to seagrass decline. While some exposure to high concentrations of nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, can result in increased seagrass productivity, high nutrient levels can also stimulate the rapid overgrowth of macroalgae and epiphytes in shallow water, and phytoplankton in deeper water. In response to high nutrient levels, macroalgae form dense canopies on the surface of the water, limiting the light able to reach the benthic seagrasses. Algal blooms caused by eutrophication also lead to hypoxic conditions, which seagrasses are also highly susceptible to. Since coastal sediment is generally anoxic, seagrass must supply oxygen to their below-ground roots either through photosynthesis or by the diffusion of oxygen in the water column. When the water surrounding seagrass becomes hypoxic, so too do seagrass tissues. Hypoxic conditions negatively affect seagrass growth and survival with seagrasses exposed to hypoxic conditions shown to have reduced rates of photosynthesis, increased respiration, and smaller growth. Hypoxic conditions can eventually lead to seagrass die-off which creates a positive feedback cycle, where the decomposition of organic matter further decreases the amount of oxygen present in the water column.

Possible seagrass population trajectories have been studied in the Mediterranean sea. These studies suggest that the presence of seagrass depends on physical factors such as temperature, salinity, depth and turbidity, along with natural phenomena like climate change and anthropogenic pressure. While there are exceptions, regression was a general trend in many areas of the Mediterranean Sea. There is an estimated 27.7% reduction along the southern coast of Latium, 18%-38% reduction in the Northern Mediterranean basin, 19%-30% reduction on Ligurian coasts since the 1960s and 23% reduction in France in the past 50 years. In Spain the main reason for regression was due to human activity such as illegal trawling and aquaculture farming. It was found that areas with medium to high human impact suffered more severe reduction. Overall, it was suggested that 29% of known areal seagrass populations have disappeared since 1879. The reduction in these areas suggests that should warming in the Mediterranean basin continue, it may lead to a functional extinction of &quot;Posidonia oceanica&quot; in the Mediterranean by 2050. Scientists suggested that the trends they identified appear to be part of a large-scale trend worldwide.

Conservation efforts are imperative to the survival of seagrass species. While there are many challenges to overcome with respect to seagrass conservation there are some major ones that can be addressed. Societal awareness of what seagrasses are and their importance to human well-being is incredibly important. As the majority of people become more urbanized they are increasingly more disconnected from the natural world. This allows for misconceptions and a lack of understanding of seagrass ecology and its importance. Additionally, it is a challenge to obtain and maintain information on the status and condition of seagrass populations. With many populations across the globe, it is difficult to map the current populations. Another challenge faced in seagrass conservation is the ability to identify threatening activities on a local scale. Also, in an ever growing human population, there is a need to balance the needs of the people while also balancing the needs of the planet. Lastly, it is challenging to generate scientific research to support conservation of seagrass. Limited efforts and resources are dedicated to the study of seagrasses. This is seen in areas such as India and China where there is little to no plan in place to conserve seagrass populations. However, the conservation and restoration of seagrass may contribute to 16 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.

In a study of seagrass conservation in China, several suggestions were made by scientists on how to better conserve seagrass. They suggested that seagrass beds should be included in the Chinese conservation agenda as done in other countries. They called for the Chinese government to forbid land reclamation in areas near or in seagrass beds, to reduce the number and size of culture ponds, to control raft aquaculture and improve sediment quality, to establish seagrass reserves, to increase awareness of seagrass beds to fishermen and policy makers and to carry out seagrass restoration. Similar suggestions were made in India where scientists suggested that public engagement was important. Also, scientists, the public, and government officials should work in tandem to integrate traditional ecological knowledge and socio-cultural practices to evolve conservation policies.

World Seagrass Day is an annual event held on March 1 to raise awareness about seagrass and its important functions in the marine ecosystem.

<doc id="234146" wikidata="Q740337" url="?curid=234146" title="Sartorius muscle">
<text>The sartorius muscle () is the longest muscle in the human body. It is a long, thin, superficial muscle that runs down the length of the thigh in the anterior compartment.

==Structure==
The sartorius muscle originates from the anterior superior iliac spine, and part of the notch between the anterior superior iliac spine and anterior inferior iliac spine. It runs obliquely across the upper and anterior part of the thigh in an inferomedial direction.
It passes behind the medial condyle of the femur to end in a tendon. This tendon curves anteriorly to join the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles in the pes anserinus, where it inserts into the superomedial surface of the tibia.

Its upper portion forms the lateral border of the femoral triangle, and the point where it crosses adductor longus marks the apex of the triangle. Deep to sartorius and its fascia is the adductor canal, through which the saphenous nerve, femoral artery and vein, and nerve to vastus medialis pass.

===Innervation===
Like the other muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh, the sartorius is innervated by the femoral nerve.

===Variation===
It may originate from the outer end of the inguinal ligament, the notch of the ilium, the ilio-pectineal line or the pubis.

The muscle may be split into two parts, and one part may be inserted into the fascia lata, the femur, the ligament of the patella or the tendon of the semitendinosus.

The tendon of insertion may end in the fascia lata, the capsule of the knee-joint, or the fascia of the leg.

The muscle may be absent in some people.

==Function==
The sartorius muscle can move the hip joint and the knee joint, but all of its actions are weak, making it a synergist muscle. At the hip, it can flex, weakly abduct, and laterally rotate the femur. At the knee, it can flex the leg; when the knee is flexed, sartorius medially rotates the leg. Sitting cross-legged demonstrates all four actions of the sartorius.

==Clinical significance==
One of the many conditions that can disrupt the use of the sartorius is pes anserine bursitis, an inflammatory condition of the medial portion of the knee. This condition usually occurs in athletes from overuse and is characterized by pain, swelling and tenderness. The pes anserinus involves the tendons of the gracilis, semitendinosus, and sartorius muscles; these tendons attach onto the anteromedial proximal tibia. When inflammation of the bursae underlying the tendons occurs, they separate from the head of the tibia.

== History ==
The name sartorius comes from the Latin word &quot;sartor&quot;, meaning tailor, and it is sometimes called the tailor&#x27;s muscle. This name is likely in reference to the cross-legged position in which tailors once sat. Similarly in French, an older name for this muscle is &quot;couturier&quot; (seamstress or dressmaker), with similar reference to &quot;sitting as a tailor&quot; (in French: &quot;s&#x27;asseoir en tailleur&quot;). There are other hypotheses as to the origin of the name. One is that it refers to the location of the inferior portion of the muscle being the &quot;inseam&quot; or area of the inner thigh that tailors commonly measure when fitting trousers. Another is that the muscle closely resembles a tailor&#x27;s ribbon. Additionally, antique sewing machines required continuous crossbody pedaling. This combination of lateral rotation and flexion of the hip and flexion of the knee gave tailors particularly developed sartorius muscles.

<doc id="234149" wikidata="Q541037" url="?curid=234149" title="Ashikaga Yoshihide">
<text>was the 14th &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Ashikaga shogunate who held nominal power for a few months in 1568 during the Muromachi period of Japan. When he became &quot;shōgun&quot;, he changed his name to Yoshinaga, but he is more conventionally recognized today by the name Yoshihide. In 1568, Yoshihide became &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot; three years after the death of his cousin, the thirteenth &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiteru.
==Biography==
Shortly after having been proclaimed &quot;shōgun&quot;, Yoshihide died from a contagious disease. In the same month, Oda Nobunaga marched his armies into Kyoto. He seized control of the capital. Nobunaga installed Ashikaga Yoshiaki as the fifteenth &quot;shōgun&quot;.

== Family ==
* Father: Ashikaga Yoshitsuna
* Mother: daughter of Ouchi Yoshiyuki
* Wife: Yuki no Tsubone

==Era of Yoshihide&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
The year in which Yoshihide was shogun is encompassed within a single era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
*&quot;Eiroku&quot; (1558–1570)

<doc id="234160" wikidata="Q447066" url="?curid=234160" title="Ashikaga Yoshiteru">
<text>, also known as Yoshifushi or Yoshifuji, was the 13th &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Ashikaga shogunate who reigned from 1546 to 1565 during the late Muromachi period of Japan. He was the eldest son of the 12th &quot;shōgun&quot;, Ashikaga Yoshiharu, and his mother was a daughter of Konoe Hisamichi (later called , &quot;Keijuin&quot;). When he became shogun in 1546 at age 11, Yoshiteru&#x27;s name was Yoshifushi (sometimes transliterated as Yoshifuji); but some years later in 1554, he changed his name to the one by which he is conventionally known today. His childhood name was Kikubemaru (). His younger brother Ashikaga Yoshiaki became the fifteenth &quot;shōgun&quot;.

==Installed as &quot;shōgun&quot;==

After his father, Yoshiharu, was forced to retire in 1546 over a political struggle with Hosokawa Harumoto, Yoshiteru became &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot;, albeit a puppet &quot;shōgun&quot; like his father. Yoshiteru was only 11 at the time and his investiture ceremony was held at Sakamoto, Ōmi Province, outside Kyoto.

Yoshiteru had barely been confirmed as &quot;shōgun&quot; when his father Yoshiharu made a truce with Harumoto to return to Kyoto. Yet, Harumoto&#x27;s retainer Miyoshi Nagayoshi parted with Harumoto to take the side of Hosokawa Ujitsuna and the two Hosokawa started a war that drove out Yoshiteru, his father Yoshiharu, and Harumoto as well, from Kyoto. In 1550, Yoshiharu died in Ōmi, unable to return to Kyoto.

In 1552, Yoshiteru made a peace with Nagayoshi to return to Kyoto. However, the next year, Yoshiteru and Harumoto started a war against Nagayoshi to remove his influence. With the help of Rokkaku Yoshikata, the war initially went well for Yoshiteru but he was driven out of Kyoto again in 1558 with a counterattack from Nagayoshi. Nagayoshi did not press on after the victory to kill Yoshiteru for fear of being accused of killing a shogun, and instead signed a truce to have Yoshiteru back in Kyoto under his influence. Nagayoshi continued as the real power in Kyoto, with Yoshiteru nothing more than a rubber stamp.

Finally, in 1565, Matsunaga Hisahide invaded Kyoto, which led to a tragic turn of events as Yoshiteru decided to take his own life.

==Governance==
Surrounded by &quot;daimyō&quot; who intended only to use the authority of shogun for their own good, Yoshiteru still managed to reaffirm the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s authority by active diplomacy that extended to every part of Japan. By trying to negotiate a peace between such well-known &quot;daimyō&quot; as Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin, Shimazu Takahisa, Ōtomo Yoshishige, Mōri Motonari, and Amago Haruhisa, the shogun&#x27;s authority was again recognized by various &quot;daimyō&quot;. Lacking resources, Yoshiteru nevertheless saw opportunities to assign his kanji &quot;&quot; on various samurai such as Mōri Terumoto to become something close to a godfather. Yoshiteru was well respected for his actions and many researchers credit him as being the last effective &quot;shōgun&quot; to hold the post. Oda Nobunaga and Uesugi Kenshin were among the many &quot;daimyō&quot; and samurai who travelled to Kyoto to pay their respects to the &quot;shōgun&quot;.

==End of reign==
In 1564, Nagayoshi died of illness and Yoshiteru saw an opportunity to fully reclaim the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s authority. However, Matsunaga Danjo Hisahide and the three member council of Miyoshi, the Miyoshi Triumvirs, who wanted to rule just as Nagayoshi had, were willing to go to any lengths to remove Yoshiteru from the power and to have Ashikaga Yoshihide as the puppet &quot;shōgun&quot;.

In 1565, Matsunaga Danjo Hisahide&#x27;s son Matsunaga Hisamichi and Miyoshi Yoshitsugu laid siege against a collection of buildings (that would later become Nijō Castle) where Yoshiteru lived. With no help arriving in time from the &quot;daimyōs&quot; that could have supported him, Yoshiteru and the few troops under him were overrun by Miyoshi.

Jesuit missionary Father Luís Fróis, in his account of the overthrow of Ashikaga Yoshiteru, wrote about the strong sexual love relationship between Yoshiteru and his squire, Odachidono. According to Father Fróis, the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s squire, Odachidono, &quot;fought so valiantly and with such intrepid spirit that all the rebels started to shout out that he should not be killed, but that he should be taken alive. Nonetheless, seeing his master die, and believing it a great dishonour to survive him, the youth threw away his sword, and pulling out his dagger, he cut open his throat and then his belly. Finally he killed himself by lying down flat with the dagger in his belly.&quot;

Three years passed before his cousin Ashikaga Yoshihide became the fourteenth &quot;shōgun&quot;.

==Legacy==
Because of his inner strength and the katana skills that he was known to have practiced regularly, Yoshiteru was called the &quot;Kengo &quot;shōgun&quot;&quot; (剣豪将軍) and was closer to being a samurai and a warlord than any &quot;shōgun&quot; since Ashikaga Takauji. One of his sword-fighting instructors was Tsukahara Bokuden, the founder of Kashima Shintō-ryū. His governance was highly credited but to have been killed in spite of his efforts completely destroyed what little recognition and authority Yoshiteru built up.

The waka Yoshiteru was said to have left on his death shows the extent of his aspirations compared with the limits of achievements.

==Eras of Yoshiteru&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
There were more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot; in which Yoshiteru was identified as Shogun .
* &quot;Tenbun&quot; (1532–1555)
* &quot;Kōji&quot; (1555–1558)
* &quot;Eiroku&quot; (1558–1570)

== Tenka-Goken ==
The &quot;Mikazuki Munechika&quot; is another one of Japan’s &quot;Tenka-Goken&quot; and is considered the most beautiful of the five blades. This tachi style samurai sword was created Sanjô Munechika and was named for its crescent moon shape (&quot;mikazuki&quot;). Like all of the Tenka-Goken, the Mikazuki Munechika is one of Japan’s National Treasures and is currently on display at the Tokyo National Museum.

Over its long history, the Mikazuki Munechika has been owned by several important Japanese families. During the mid-16th century, the Mikazuki Munechika belonged to the Ashikaga family and the sword was used by shogun Ashikaga Yoshiteru to defend himself until he died during an attack on the palace by the Miyoshi family. The sword, along with other Ashikaga treasures, was taken by Miyoshi Masayasu. The Mikazuki Munechika was passed down a few more times before it was owned by the Tokugawa family.

<text>In marketing, product bundling is offering several products or services for sale as one combined product or service package. It is a common feature in many imperfectly competitive product and service markets. Industries engaged in the practice include telecommunications services, financial services, health care, information, and consumer electronics. A software bundle might include a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation program into a single office suite. The cable television industry often bundles many TV and movie channels into a single tier or package. The fast food industry combines separate food items into a &quot;combo meal&quot; or &quot;value meal&quot;.

A bundle of products may be called a package deal; in recorded music or video games, a compilation or box set; or in publishing, an [[anthology]].

Product bundling is most suitable for high volume and high margin (i.e., low marginal cost) products. Research by Yannis Bakos and Erik Brynjolfsson found that bundling was particularly effective for digital information goods with close to zero marginal cost, and could enable a bundler with an inferior collection of products to drive even superior quality goods out of the market place.

Most firms are multi-product or multi-service companies faced with the decision whether to sell products or services separately at individual prices or whether combinations of products should be marketed in the form of &quot;bundles&quot; for which a &quot;bundle price&quot; is asked. Price bundling plays an increasingly important role in many industries (e.g. banking, insurance, software, automotive) and some companies even build their business strategies on bundling. In bundle pricing, companies sell a package or set of goods or services for a lower price than they would charge if the customer bought all of them separately. Pursuing a bundle pricing strategy allows a business to increase its profit by using a discount to induce customers to buy more than they otherwise would have.

==Rationale==
Bundling is most successful when:
*There are economies of scale in production. 
*There are economies of scope in distribution. This can be seen in consumer electronics bundles where a big box electronics store offers all of the components for a home theatre setup (DVD player, flatscreen TV, surround sound speakers, receiver, subwoofer) for a lower price than if each component were to be purchased separately. The big box electronics store can exploit its economies of scope, as they distribute and sell a huge range of home theatre products.
*The Marginal costs of bundling are low.
*Production set-up costs are high.
*Customer acquisition costs are high.
*Consumers appreciate the resulting simplification of the purchase decision and benefit from the joint performance of the combined product or service. This is particularly the case when a non-specialist consumer has information asymmetry when trying to buy all of the components of a home theatre (speakers, connection cables, speaker wire). He/she would need to learn about all of the product specifications and the requirements for accessories used with the main items. For example, with Home Theatre in a Box, a consumer can feel confident that all of the included speakers are of the correct impedance and power rating and that all of the included cables are the correct models.

While many well-known examples of bundling are all products or services from the same store or provider, such as the sports package for a car or a grocery store&#x27;s gift basket, in some cases, cross-industry bundles are assembled and sold. For example, some travel agencies have vacation tour bundles that may include air tickets, rail tickets, a rental car, hotels, restaurants, museum and sightseeing attraction tickets and live music event tickets. These bundles include products and services from the transportation, accommodation, tourism, food service and entertainment industries.

Consumers have heterogeneous demands and such demands for different parts of the bundle product are inversely correlated. For example, assume consumer A values a word processor software at $100 and a spreadsheet processor at $60, while consumer B values a word processor at $60 and spreadsheet at $100. Seller can generate a maximum revenue of only $240 by setting a $60 price for each product—both consumers will buy both products. Revenue cannot be increased without bundling because as the seller increases the price above $60 for one of the goods, one of the consumers will refuse to buy it. With bundling, a seller can generate revenue of $320 by bundling the products together and selling the bundle at $160. Thus, bundling can be considered a form of price discrimination.

Venkatesh and Mahajan reviewed the research on bundle design and pricing in 2009. A 1997 study by Mercer Management Consulting, in Massachusetts stated that good bundles have five elements: (1) the package is worth more than the &quot;sum of its parts&quot; for the consumer; (2) the bundle brings order and simplicity to a set of confusing or tedious choices; (3) the bundle solves a problem for the consumer; (4) the bundle is focused and lean in an effort to avoid carrying or including options, goods or services the consumer has no use for; and (5) the bundle generates interest or even controversy. Number 1 can be read as simply that a bundle should cost less than buying each item separately; however, even if the bundle were to cost the same in dollars, a bundle may still be an appealing value proposition for a consumer, as they do not have to hand-pick each accessory and add-on item (this is the 2nd and 3rd point).

Bundling is often thought of mainly as a value pricing strategy, in that product bundles often cost less than if each item were purchased separately. However, bundling can also have other strategic advantages. For example, when a grocery store is making up a gift basket, they can use the design of the basket item list as a way to promote new products or brands that a customer may not know or as a way to liquidate merchandise that is not selling well. Also, even though many bundles are less expensive than all of the items if purchased separately, in some cases the bundle costs more than if each item was purchased separately; this tactic is particularly effective in high-end retailing where conspicuous consumption and prestige pricing elements come into play. A well-off home theatre enthusiast with a very high budget may find a $10,000 home theatre package attractive, even if it costs a bit more than buying each item separately, because this is an impressive total cost.

==Varieties==
*Pure bundling occurs when a consumer can only purchase the entire bundle or nothing
**Joint bundling is a subcategory of pure bundling in which the two products are offered together for one bundled price
**Leader bundling is a subcategory of pure bundling in which a leader product is offered for discount if purchased with a non-leader product, accessory or other item. 
***Mixed-leader bundling is a variant of leader bundling with the added possibility of buying the leader product on its own.
*Mixed bundling occurs when consumers are offered a choice between purchasing the entire bundle or one of the separate parts of the bundle.

Bundling in political economy is a type of product bundling in which the &quot;product&quot; is a candidate in an election who markets his or her bundle of attributes and political positions to the voters. For example, a political candidate may market herself as a centrist candidate by ensuring she/he has centrist social, economic, and law enforcement positions.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Advantages:
* Help the company sell some unpopular products and speed up inventory clearance. Product bundling combines the best-selling products and unpopular products with less inventory by setting reasonable prices to increase the attractiveness, so that consumers can buy combination products to help the company reduce inventory.
* Help the company generate more sales and maximize profits. Product bundling can maximize consumer surplus so that consumers feel that they have obtained additional items, so customers are more likely to spend a total of one time to purchase multiple products. This can help the company increase total sales revenue by increasing the average order value, average transaction value, and the amount of each transaction, because multiple products are more expensive than a single product.
* Enable the company to promote more differentiated products with lower marketing costs. The company can spend the same energy and cost to promote two or more products at the same time.
* Help consumers reduce decision-making pressure. Merchants use matching algorithms to set up bundled products that meet the needs of consumers, thereby guiding customers to choose options that meet their needs and reducing their decision fatigue. Bundles have the effect of reducing search costs.

Disadvantages to the consumer:
* Decreases competition. 
* Reduces consumer choice; consumers may be forced to buy bundles which don&#x27;t contain all the things they wanted, and contain things they don&#x27;t want, and may even be pushed into buying inferior products. For example, two companies both sell a bundle containing a computer and an operating system, but one has poor-quality hardware and one has poor-quality software. The consumer wants to buy each company&#x27;s good product, but can&#x27;t unless they pay for two computers and two operating systems and throw one of each away. A new company which sells only hardware or only operating systems also has to persuade the consumer to throw away a purchased product; this is a barrier to market entry.
* Can drive up consumer costs.
* A method of price discrimination.

Disadvantages to the seller:
* Product bundling may lead to the cannibalization of branded products. These products can be purchased outside of the bundled sales package. For example, if a company sells bundled products and individual products at the same time, then the bundled products will get more sales, which will reduce the profit of the individual products.
* When consumers cannot buy certain products individually, they may not buy them because they feel that the bundled sales package forces them to buy more products.

==Software==

In the computer industry, bundled software is distributed with another product such as a piece of computer hardware or other electronic device, or is a group of software packages which are sold together. Software which is pre-installed on a new computer is an example of bundled software. For example, as of 2017, most desktop, laptop and mobile computers are bought pre-loaded with various software and software applications (&quot;apps&quot;). A pack-in game is a form of bundled software.

Early microcomputer companies varied in their decision to bundle software. &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1984 observed that &quot;Kaypro apparently has tremendous buying and bargaining power&quot;, noting that the Kaypro 10 came with both WordStar and Perfect Writer, plus &quot;two spelling checkers, two spreadsheets, two communications programs and three versions of BASIC&quot;. Stating that year that a computer that weighs 30 pounds &quot;really isn&#x27;t very portable&quot;, &quot;Creative Computing&quot; concluded that &quot;the main reason that the Osborne was a success was not that it was transportable, but that it came with a pile of bundled software&quot;. Compaq, by contrast, did not bundle software, stating that &quot;You remove the freedom from the dealers to really merchandise when you bundle in software ... Why should you be constrained to use the software that comes with a piece of hardware? I think it can tend to inhibit sales over the long run.&quot; MacWrite&#x27;s inclusion with early Macintosh computers discouraged developers from creating other word processing software for the computer. Many companies sold multimedia upgrade kits—a CD-ROM drive, sound card, speakers, and what &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described as &quot;a boatload of bundled software&quot;—during the mid-1990s.

==Home theatre in a box==
In the 1990s and in the 2000s (decade) and 2010s, many consumer electronics companies designed home theatre equipment bundles, known as Home Theatre in a Box (HTIB). For a customer who already owned a TV, and in some cases a DVD player or other source for playing back movies, a HTIB package provides all of the electronics hardware, speakers and cables needed to set up a home cinema. There are three grades of HTIB bundles: economy bundles, aimed at the lowest price point; mid-tier bundles, the most common type; and higher-cost HTIB bundles made by BOSE and other higher-end manufacturers. At the economy grade HTIB package, the customer is provided with a basic home theatre set-up, with modest sound quality and relatively few options for adjusting the sound. The mid-tier and upper-tier packages offer better performance and more set-up options. All three HTIB tiers, though, have a similar value proposition for the buyer: the HTIB package ensures that all of the speakers are of the correct impedance and power handling capabilities, the cables are of the correct type, and the crossover points and other technical details have been set up by the manufacturer.

The most serious home theatre enthusiasts do not typically buy HTIB bundles, as they are a more sophisticated target market. As such, the most serious home cinema-philes typically purchase each component (power amplifiers, speakers, subwoofer cabinet, speaker cables) separately, so that they can choose which items meet their specific movie-watching goals. For example, a serious home theatre enthusiast may wish to have a large cabinet subwoofer enclosure with heavy bracing, a type and size of subwoofer cabinet that would not be found in any HTIB bundle due to its large size and high cost. As well, a serious home theatre enthusiast may wish to have a powered subwoofer with a user-adjustable crossover, a &quot;subsonic&quot; filter and other higher-cost advanced features.

==Market power and competitiveness==
In oligopolistic and monopolistic industries, product bundling can be seen as an unfair use of market power because it limits the choices available to the consumer. In these cases it is typically called product tying.
Some forms of product bundling have been subject to litigation regarding abuses of market share.

===&quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot;===
&quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot; was a set of civil actions filed against Microsoft Corporation pursuant to the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 Sections 1 and 2 on May 18, 1998, by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and 20 states. Joel I. Klein was the lead prosecutor. The plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft abused monopoly power on Intel-based personal computers in its handling of operating system sales and web browser sales. The issue central to the case was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship Internet Explorer (IE) web browser software with its Microsoft Windows operating system. Bundling them together is alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft&#x27;s victory in the browser wars as every Windows user had a copy of Internet Explorer.

==TV programing bundles by cable and satellite providers==

Cable and satellite television (Pay TV) have bundled TV channels since the inception of both. In the early years of the cable industry this was necessary due to the technological constraints associated with allowing and blocking channels transmitted via analog methods. The progress towards complete cable, internet, and telephone packages gave subscribers many more options as well as offering hundreds of channels. The &quot;package&quot; price depends on the level of service a customer prefers within each bundle. The services range from low speed internet and minimum channels to high speed internet and the addition of many premium channels. In the US prices for pay TV have doubled in the last twenty years, averaging 6% per year, while wages have remained the same for nearly 20 years causing dissatisfaction and many cancellations. Costs have risen 53% since 2007 and Comcast and AT&amp;T&#x27;s Direct TV went up in January 2018. With the Digital television transition opportunities for competition to pay TV ushered in online video companies and forcing pay TV companies to examine à la carte cable company packages.

A 2018 consumer report shows many subscribers are dissatisfied with cable TV, mainly over prices, which has led to many complaints. Google Fiber was an exception to widespread consumer dissatisfaction. Verizon and the two satellite-TV companies —AT&amp;T&#x27;s DirecTV and Dish Network rated better than Cox Communications, Comcast, Spectrum, Optimum, CenturyLink, SuddenLink Communications, Atlantic Broadband, Frontier Communications, and Mediacom was rated at the bottom. Internet providers EPB (Fiber Optics) and Google Fiber received top ratings for value. Of the smaller companies only Armstrong received top ratings and RCN, Hawaiian Telcom (bought by Cincinnati Bell in 2018), and Grande Communications received slightly higher ratings.

The high price of current complete bundling, upwards of $180–200, along with poor customer service, surprise bills, and technical difficulties, resulted in Angie&#x27;s List reporting that these things were the number two most complained about category.

Alternative streaming-based providers of cable TV channel bundles in the United States, also known as vMVPDs, such as FuboTV, Hulu + Live TV, Philo, Sling TV, and YouTube TV, launched in the 2010s, providing additional options for consumers who want access to linear cable channels but are dissatisfied with local providers. Additionally, reduced-price bundles of streaming service packages, such as The Disney Bundle, are also offered by some providers.

<text>A fascial compartment is a section within the body that contains muscles and nerves and is surrounded by deep fascia. In the human body, the limbs can each be divided into two segments – the upper limb can be divided into the arm and the forearm and the sectional compartments of both of these – the fascial compartments of the arm and the fascial compartments of the forearm contain an anterior and a posterior compartment. Likewise, the lower limbs can be divided into two segments – the leg and the thigh – and these contain the fascial compartments of the leg and the fascial compartments of the thigh.

==Structure==
If these segments are cut transversely, it is apparent that they are divided into multiple sections. These are called fascial compartments, and are formed by tough connective tissue septa.

These compartments usually have a nerve and blood supply separate from their neighbours. The muscles in each compartment will often all be supplied by the same nerve.

Sometimes the segment is also covered by bone profoundly (as e.g. the brachial fascia). It is distinguished from pharmacokinetic compartment, which is a defined volume of body fluids.

==Clinical significance==

Compartment syndrome is an acute medical problem following injury or surgery in which increased pressure (usually caused by inflammation) occurs within a compartment.

<doc id="234169" wikidata="Q3084961" url="?curid=234169" title="Product lining">
<text>In marketing jargon, product lining refers to the offering of several related products for individual sale. Unlike product bundling, where several products are combined into one group, which is then offered for sale as a units, product lining involves offering the products for sale separately. A line can comprise related products of various sizes, types, colors, qualities, or prices. &quot;Line depth&quot; refers to the number of subcategories under a category. &quot;Line consistency&quot; refers to how closely related the products that make up the line are. &quot;Line vulnerability&quot; refers to the percentage of sales or profits that are derived from only a few products in the line.

In comparison to product bundling, which is a strategy of offering more than one product for promotion as one combined item to create differentiation and greater value, product lining consists of selling different related products individually. The products in the product line can come in various sizes, colours, qualities or prices. For instance, the variety of coffees that are offered at a café is one of its product lines and it could consist of flat white, cappuccinos, short black, lattes, mochas, etc. Alternatively, product line of juices and pastries can also be found at a café. The benefits from having a successful product line is the brand identification from customers which result in customer loyalty and multiple purchases. It increases the likelihood of customers purchasing new products from the company that have just been added into the product line due to the previous satisfying purchases.

== Product mix ==
In marketing, the number of product lines offered is referred as the width of product mix. Product mix, also known as product assortment, is the total number of variety of products that a firm sells to their customers. It measures the total number of product lines. Some companies will focus solely and sell only one type of product that they specialise in. Also, some would offer numerous types of products for diversified markets, depending on the size and objectives of the entities. Each approaches&#x27; results vary based on many factors including location, market, trends, etc. Therefore, businesses should carefully consider their product mix. The width of product mix is one of the four dimensions of product mix along with the length, depth and consistency of product mix.

=== Width ===
As mentioned above, the width of product mix is referred to as the total number of product lines that the company offers. A diversified product mix can target the maximum number of customers, however, such numbers of product lines requires much attention and focus as each product line targets different groups of consumers and involves individual strategy and management. Although specialisation of products (narrow product mix) might be easier for businesses to operate and manage, it reduces the ability to reach out to diverse markets as they fail to offer sufficient options for consumers to cater to their &quot;needs and wants.&quot;

=== Length ===
The length of product mix refers to the total number of products sold by a company. A product line consists of many similar products defined by its functions and customer market while short product line consists of fewer related products. Customer satisfaction could be achieved through longer product lines. However, overly dense product lines may result in competition within the same line and lead to loss of revenue and customers. If product lines are too short, consumer options are limited, forcing them to switch to competitors with a longer range of products.

=== Depth ===
The depth of product mix pertains to the total number of variations of product in a product line. For example, a brand would be considered to have a depth of four if it sells two sizes and two flavours of soda.

=== Consistency ===
The consistency of product mix refers to how closely associated the products in the same product line are to each other, in terms of their use, production and distribution. A business’ production mix could be very consistent in distribution, yet extremely different in other areas such as use. For instance, a company may be selling health related items such as multi-vitamins tablet and magazines. Although both products fit into the same product line, they are completely dissimilar in use while one is editable and the other is not.

== Product line extension and product line stretching ==
When companies add a new item to a product line, it is referred to as the product line extension. The purpose of it is to attract new customers who may not be familiar or satisfied with the current standard product line. For example, when a lifestyle pharmacy decided to add in a high protein muesli bar into its current product line of muesli bar. Companies with an effective product line can employ product line extension in order to reach new demographic customers in different geographic areas.

When a business adds a line extension to the product line and if it is of a higher quality than the current products, it is considered as trading up or an upward stretch. Alternatively, if the new added item is of lower quality compared to other existing products, it is known as trading down or a downward stretch. These stretches are known as product line stretching. Supermarkets often apply product line stretching to their product lines by offering different grading of their own brand products to ensure all markets are covered for maximum interest from customers. In addition, when companies add new varieties of existing products it is known as product line filling.

== Product line pricing ==
Product line pricing is a product pricing strategy, used when a company has more than one product in a product line. It is a process that traders adopt to separate products in the same category into various price groups, to create different quality levels in the customers’ minds.

For instance, vehicle manufacturers produce their vehicles in different models including economy models, environmental models, luxury models and more. Each of them has an individual cost or price to display the difference in levels. With that being said, for any pricing techniques to be effective, demand elasticity, the whole product mix, product positioning strategy and the product life cycle have to be put into consideration to determine the best price for each product.

=== Price lining ===
Price lining is a method of pricing different products for a limited number of prices. This strategy allows ease of administering and companies are able to predict their markets of customers and profits much easier. Dollar Store is an excellent example of price lining as most products sold there are $1.

=== Captive pricing ===
Captive pricing is a strategy drawing consumers’ interests and encouraging purchases by offering a basic product for a really low price, however, they will have to purchase additional items in order to obtain the full value of the product they have received. Although the retailer might lose profit on the first sales item, they will manage to gain it back from the additional products that customers buy. For example, razor blades and razor manufacturers usually sell razor handles for an unbeatable price while selling additional blade cartridges at a much higher price. Captive pricing is most effective when there are no other similar products from competitors in the same price range.

=== Bundled pricing ===
Bundled pricing is the approach of selling products and their accessories or other options as one product for one price. Consumers will not need to purchase each item separately but one bundled item and priced as one product. This would also be appealing to customers as normally they would be on sale and have the original price still tagged on the product to emphasize the price difference. For instance, retailers will offer a bundle deal for purchasing a new computer with its accessories, such as keyboard and mouse pad.

=== Bait pricing ===
Bait Pricing, also known as &quot;Bait and Switch&quot; is often considered unethical and sometimes illegal. It involves promoting items at a really low price to entice customers, with only limited supplies. Customers will come into the store looking for the advertised product and find out is out of stock or does not even exist, and afterward be encouraged to purchase a comparable, higher-priced product that is available in store.

=== Leader pricing ===
Similar to Bait pricing, retailers use leader pricing to entice customers to come into the stores by advertising items, the loss leaders, at a low price. When they arrive at the stores aiming for the promoted products, they often end up buying additional products at their full prices. Therefore, businesses earn their profit off of the unplanned buying decisions by customers besides the loss leaders.

==Related jargon==

The number of different categories of a company is referred to as &quot;width of product mix&quot;. The total number of products sold in all lines is referred to as &quot;length of product mix&quot;. If a line of products is sold with the same brand name, this is referred to as family branding. When you add a new product to a line, it is referred to as a &quot;line extension&quot;. When you have a single saleable item distinguishable by size, appearance, price or some other attribute in your product line, it is called SKU-Stock Keeping Unit.

The marketing jargon for adding a product that is better quality than other products in the line is &quot;trading up&quot; or &quot;brand leveraging&quot; or &quot;up-market stretch&quot;. A line extension of lower quality is called &quot;trading down&quot; or &quot;down-market stretch&quot;. &quot;Trading down&quot; may reduce your brand equity by gaining short-term sales at the expense of long term sales. The jargon for &quot;stretching the line&quot; in both the directions is &quot;two-way stretch&quot;.

&quot;Image anchors&quot; are highly promoted products within a line that define the image of the whole line. Image anchors are usually from the higher end of the line&#x27;s range. When you add a new product within the current range of an incomplete line, this is referred to as &quot;line filling&quot;.

&quot;Price lining&quot; is the use of a limited number of prices for all your product offerings. This is a tradition started in the old five and dime stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. Its underlying rationale is that these amounts are seen as suitable price points for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of inflation or unstable prices.

<text>Benjamin Lynch (2 April 1913 – 6 August 1946), known as Our Benny, was a Scottish professional boxer who fought in the flyweight division. He is considered by some to be one of the finest boxers below the lightweight division in his era and has been described as the greatest fighter Scotland ever produced. &quot;The Ring Magazine&quot; founder Nat Fleischer rated Lynch as the No. 5 flyweight of all-time while his publication placed him 63rd in its 2002 list of the &quot;Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years&quot;. Like Fleischer, both Statistical boxing website BoxRec and the International Boxing Research Organization also rank Lynch as the 5th greatest flyweight ever. He was elected to the Ring Magazine hall of fame in 1986 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998.

== Life and career ==

He was born in a tenement flat at 17 Florence Street, in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, and learned his fighting skills in the carnival booths that were popular in the west of Scotland during the Great Depression.

=== Early professional fights===
Lynch made his professional debut in April 1931 with a second round stoppage of Young Bryce. His professional career started inauspiciously, winning only 8 of his first 15 fights. His first significant victory came in June 1932, when he beat the experienced Jock Joe Aitken on points.

In March 1933 he began an unbeaten run that would last three years. He beat Bert Kirby on points in October 1933, and in January 1934 beat Jim Brady in an eliminator for the Scottish Area flyweight title, beating Jim Campbell in May to take the title. He successfully defended the title against Campbell a month later. Lynch rounded off the year with further wins over opponents including Maurice Huguenin, Jim Brady, Valentin Angelmann, and Pedro Ruiz.

=== British and European flyweight champion ===
Lynch won the British, European and world flyweight titles from Jackie Brown in an historic bout held in Manchester on 9 September 1935, the two having fought a draw six months earlier. The fight attracted enormous support from Glaswegians who travelled en masse to watch Lynch floor his opponent eight times before the bout was stopped in the second round.

In his next three fights he beat Gaston Maton (but had to pay a forfeit after failing to make the weight), Harry Orton, and Phil Milligan, before suffering his first defeat in three years when he lost on points to Jimmy Warnock in Belfast in March 1936.

In September 1936 he successfully defended his British and European titles against Pat Palmer, stopping the Londoner in the eighth round.

In November 1936, Lynch was sued for £2,000 by his former manager Samuel Wilson, for alleged breach of contract; Lynch counter-sued, alleging that Wilson had not carried out his duties properly.

=== World flyweight champion ===
There was dispute, on at least on one side of the Atlantic, as to who was the genuine world flyweight champion. Lynch, recognised as champion in Britain, settled the matter when he out-pointed NBA and NYSAC flyweight champion Filipino Small Montana in London in January 1937 to establish himself as the undisputed world flyweight boxing champion.

In his next fight he beat Spanish flyweight champion Fortunato Ortega on points. In March he was disqualified against Len Hampston when his second entered the ring. The two met again three weeks later, with Lynch winning via a tenth round stoppage. In June he was again beaten by Warnock in a fight for which he failed to make the weight.

In October 1937 he handed Peter Kane his first loss by knockout in a defence of his British and world titles. One of his training sessions before the fight had attracted 10,000 spectators. Towards the end of the month he was knocked unconscious in a car crash. Two months later he stopped Georges Bataille in the eighth round at the Granby Halls in Leicester.

Lynch and Kane met again in March 1938, fighting a draw, with Lynch again failing to make the weight and paying a forfeit.

Lynch was arrested later that month and charged with driving offences after crashing his car while drunk and hitting a telegraph pole and a pram containing a 12-week-old baby, and failing to stop after the accident. His trial was delayed until after his world title fight with American Jackie Jurich. He forfeited his world flyweight title against Jurich, when he weighed in at 118.5 lb (53.8 kg), half a pound over the bantamweight limit. Lynch stopped Jurich in the 12th round, but lost the title. At his trial in July, he was fined £20 and disqualified from driving for a year.

=== Decline and death ===

In July 1938 he was fined £200 by the BBBofC and stripped of his British and European titles; Lynch appealed against the decision. In September his boxing licence was suspended for a breach of training regulations. He did, however, face K.O. Morgan at bantamweight later that month at Shawfield Park, losing on points despite being once again over the agreed weight and over 7lbs heavier than his opponent.

In October 1938, after his weight increased again and he suffered a third-round knockout at the hands of Aurel Toma, he was offered &#x27;three months holiday&#x27; and received several weeks treatment at a sanatorium in Kent, arranged by the National Sporting Club in an attempt to return him to fitness. In December he left for Ireland to spend a fortnight in a monastery near Waterford.

In January 1939 he went missing during a training camp in Stirlingshire; He was found after being lost on the hills for over six hours, half a mile from his training base, wearing just pyjamas, a dressing gown, and slippers, and suffering from hypothermia.

In February 1939 he was arrested and charged with assault. In March he was found guilty of assaulting his estranged wife, his 11-year-old sister-in-law, and three police officers, with a further charge of assaulting his 18-month old son by attempting to gas him deemed not proven, and was fined £20, with an alternative sentence of 60 days in prison. In June he was the subject of court action by the Inland Revenue.

He was due to fight Dudley Lewis on 27 February 1939 but was prohibited from doing so by the BBBofC.

On 21 August 1939, the Boxing Board refused his application for the restoration of his boxing licence, stating that &quot;he is at present not fit to carry on a career as a professional boxer&quot;.

In April 1940 he was fined 30 shillings after being found drunk in Glasgow Road, Ralston. In October 1942 he was charged with offences against a 7-year-old girl in a Glasgow cinema, and was subsequently found guilty of assaulting two girls aged 7 and 10.

He would continue to battle with alcoholism for the rest of his life despite several attempts to treat the disease. Lynch died in 1946 of malnutrition-induced respiratory failure, aged 33. He was buried at St. Kentigern&#x27;s Cemetery, Glasgow, with some 2,000 people attending the funeral.

=== Legacy ===
Lynch&#x27;s life was the subject of Bill Bryden&#x27;s 1974 stage play &quot;Benny Lynch&quot;, with a book of the play published in 1975, and a television adaptation made in 1976. A second play based on Lynch&#x27;s life, written by Peter Arnett, was first performed in 1985.

He was featured on the cover of Scottish rock band Gun&#x27;s second album, &quot;Gallus&quot;, in 1992. A documentary about the life of Benny Lynch, directed by John Mackenzie and narrated by Robert Carlyle, was made in 2003. Another documentary film about Lynch, &quot;Benny&quot;, directed by Andrew Gallimore, was first shown in 2017.

&quot;The Benny Lynch Story&quot;, a stage play written by David Carswell and directed by David Hayman Jr, with Stephen Purdon playing the boxing champion, toured Scotland in May and June 2019.

<doc id="234175" wikidata="Q3047586" url="?curid=234175" title="Edgware Road">
<text>Edgware Road is a major road in London, England. The route originated as part of Roman Watling Street and, unusually in London, it runs for in an almost perfectly straight line. Forming part of the modern A5 road, Edgware Road undergoes several name changes along its length, including Maida Vale, Kilburn High Road, Shoot Up Hill and Cricklewood Broadway; but the road is, as a whole, known as the Edgware Road, as it is the road to Edgware.

The road runs from central to suburban London, beginning at Marble Arch in the City of Westminster and heading north to Edgware in the London Borough of Barnet. It is used as the boundary for four London boroughs: Harrow and Brent to the west, and Barnet and Camden to the east.

==Route==

The road runs north-west from Marble Arch to Edgware on the outskirts of London. It crosses the Harrow Road and Marylebone Road, passing beneath the Marylebone flyover. The road passes through the areas of Maida Vale, Kilburn and Cricklewood. It then crosses the North Circular Road before West Hendon at Staples Corner. After this, the road continues in the same direction, through the Hyde, Colindale, Burnt Oak, and then reaches Edgware.
The southernmost part of the road forms part of the London Inner Ring Road and, as such, is part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone. However, when the zone was extended in February 2007, the road became part of the &quot;free through routes&quot; which allows vehicles to cross the zone during its hours of operation without paying the charge.

The southern part of the road between Marble Arch and Maida Vale, noted for its distinct Middle Eastern cuisine and many late-night bars and &quot;shisha&quot; cafes, is known to Londoners by nicknames such as &quot;Little Cairo&quot;, &quot;Little Beirut&quot; and, especially near Camden, &quot;Little Cyprus&quot;.

As it passes through the various neighbourhoods, the road name changes several times, becoming Maida Vale, Kilburn High Road and Shoot-Up Hill (in Kilburn), and Cricklewood Broadway (in Cricklewood), before becoming Edgware Road once again with intermittent stretches as West Hendon Broadway, and the Hyde. Along the entire route, it retains its identity as the A5 road under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. The A5 continues beyond the end of the Edgware Road, following the old Roman road for much of its route and terminating at Holyhead, Wales (a port for Ireland).

==History==
Before the Romans, today&#x27;s Edgware Road began as an ancient trackway within the Great Middlesex Forest. The Romans later incorporated the track into Watling Street.

Many centuries later, the road was improved by the Edgware-Kilburn turnpike trust in 1711, and a number of the local inns, functioned as stops for coaches, although they would have been quite close to the starting point of coach routes from London.

During the 18th century, it was a destination for Huguenot migrants. By 1811, Thomas Telford produced a re-design for what was then known as a section of the London to Holyhead road, a redesign considered one of the most important feats of pre-Victorian engineering. Telford&#x27;s redesign emerged only a year after the area saw the establishment of Great Britain&#x27;s first Indian restaurant.

The area began to attract Arab migrants in the late 19th century during a period of increased trade with the Ottoman Empire. The trend continued with the arrival of Egyptians and Iraqis in the 1950s, and greatly expanded beginning in the 1970s and continuing to the present when events including the Lebanese Civil War and unrest in Algeria brought more Arabs to the area. They established the present-day mix of bars and shisha cafes, which make the area known to Londoners by nicknames such as &quot;Little Cairo&quot; and &quot;Little Beirut.&quot;

One of the two Edgware Road tube stations was one of the sites of the 7 July bombings. A bomb was detonated on a train leaving the tube station serving the Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines and heading for Paddington tube station. Six people were killed in the blast. The perpetrator was the ringleader of the 7 bombings, Mohammed Siddique Khan. On the first anniversary of the bombings, a memorial plaque to the victims was unveiled at the station.

==Districts and surrounding area==
The name &quot;Edgware Road&quot; is used to refer to informally to this area of London, meaning the area immediately to the north of Marble Arch. The district&#x27;s northern boundary is the Marylebone flyover.

The postal codes of the area are W1, W2, NW1 and NW2.

The part of the road between Marble Arch and the Marylebone Flyover also separates the areas of Marylebone and Bayswater.

Edgware Road is well represented in terms of communities from across the Middle East and North Africa.

==Transport==
Edgware Road has several London bus routes, and is intersected by several London Underground lines along its length or nearby. A number of schemes have been put forward in the past to construct an Underground railway line underneath Edgware Road, including a plan to extend the Bakerloo line north to Cricklewood and an unusual proposal to build an underground monorail system, but these schemes did not succeed. Today, London Buses provide the only public transport along the length of the road.

<text>The War of the Pacific (), also known by multiple other names, was a war between Chile and a Bolivian–Peruvian alliance from 1879 to 1884. Fought over Chilean claims on coastal Bolivian territory in the Atacama Desert, the war ended with victory for Chile, which gained a significant amount of resource-rich territory from Peru and Bolivia.

The direct cause of the war was a nitrate taxation dispute between Bolivia and Chile, with Peru being drawn in due to its secret alliance with Bolivia. Some historians have pointed to deeper origins of the war, such as the interest of Chile and Peru in the nitrate business, a long-standing rivalry between Chile and Peru for regional hegemony, as well as the political and economical disparities between the stability of Chile and the volatility of Peru and Bolivia.
In February 1878, Bolivia increased taxes on the Chilean mining company &quot;&quot; (CSFA), in violation of the Boundary Treaty of 1874 which established the border between both countries and prohibited tax increases for mining. Chile protested the violation of the treaty and requested international arbitration, but the Bolivian government, presided by Hilarión Daza, considered this an internal issue subject to the jurisdiction of the Bolivian courts. Chile insisted that the breach of the treaty would mean that the territorial borders denoted in it were no longer settled. Despite this, Hilarión Daza rescinded the license of the Chilean company, seized its assets and put it up for auction. On the day of the auction, 14 February 1879, Chile&#x27;s armed forces occupied without resistance the Bolivian port city of Antofagasta, which was mostly inhabited by Chilean miners. War was declared between Bolivia and Chile on 1 March 1879, and between Chile and Peru on 5 April 1879.

Battles were fought on the Pacific Ocean, in the Atacama Desert, the Peruvian deserts, and the mountainous interior of Peru. For the first five months, the war played out in a naval campaign, as Chile struggled to establish a marine resupply corridor for its forces in the world&#x27;s driest desert. Afterwards, Chile&#x27;s land campaign overcame the Bolivian and Peruvian armies. Bolivia withdrew after the Battle of Tacna, on 26 May 1880, leaving allied Peru fighting alone for most of the war. Chilean forces occupied Peru&#x27;s capital Lima in January 1881. Remnants and irregulars of the Peruvian army waged a guerrilla war but could not prevent war-weary Peruvian factions from reaching a peace deal with Chile involving territorial cessions.

Chile and Peru signed the Treaty of Ancón on 20 October 1883. Bolivia signed a truce with Chile in 1884. Chile acquired the Peruvian territory of Tarapacá, the disputed Bolivian department of Litoral (turning Bolivia into a landlocked country), and temporary control over the Peruvian provinces of Tacna and Arica. In 1904, Chile and Bolivia signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which established definite boundaries. The 1929 Tacna–Arica compromise gave Arica to Chile and Tacna to Peru.

== Etymology ==
The conflict is also known as the &quot;Saltpeter War&quot;, the &quot;Ten Cents War&quot; (in reference to the controversial ten-centavo tax imposed by the Bolivian government), the &quot;Nitrate War&quot;, and the &quot;Second Pacific War&quot;. It is not to be confused with the pre-Columbian Saltpeter War, in what is now Mexico, nor the &quot;Guano War&quot; as the Chincha Islands War is sometimes named. The war largely settled (or set up, depending on one&#x27;s point of view) the &quot;Tacna-Arica dispute&quot; or &quot;Tacna-Arica controversy&quot;, and is sometimes known by that name as well, although the details took decades to resolve.

 () is a Quechua word for fertilizer. Potassium nitrate (ordinary saltpeter) and sodium nitrate (Chile saltpeter) are nitrogen-containing compounds collectively referred to as salpeter, saltpetre, salitre, caliche, or nitrate. They are used as fertilizer, but have other important uses. Saltpeter is used to make gunpowder.

Atacama is a Chilean region south of the Atacama Desert, which mostly coincides with the disputed Antofagasta province, known in Bolivia as Litoral.

== Background ==
When most of South America gained independence from Spain and Portugal in the 19th century the demarcation of frontiers was uncertain, particularly in remote, thinly populated portions of the newly independent nations. Bolivia and Chile&#x27;s Atacama border dispute, in the coastal territories between approximately the 23° and 24° South parallels, was just one of several longstanding border conflicts that arose in South America.

Cobija, Paposo, Mejillones and the territory of Antofagasta appears on a 1793 map of Andrés Baleato and the 1799 map of the Spanish Navy as inside the jurisdiction of Chile, pointing out the Loa River as an internal limit of the Spanish Empire between Chile and Peru, leaving Charcas without sea access.

The dry climate of the Peruvian and Bolivian coasts had permitted the accumulation and preservation of vast amounts of high-quality guano deposits and sodium nitrate. In the 1840s, Europeans knew the value of guano and nitrate as fertilizer and the role of saltpeter in explosives. The Atacama Desert became economically important. Bolivia, Chile, and Peru were in the area of the largest reserves of a resource demanded by the world. During the Chincha Islands War (1864–1866), Spain, under Queen Isabella II, attempted to exploit an incident involving Spanish citizens in Peru to re-establish its influence over the guano-rich Chincha Islands.

Starting from the Chilean silver rush in the 1830s, the Atacama was prospected and populated by Chileans. Chilean and foreign enterprises in the region eventually extended their control to the Peruvian saltpeter works. In the Peruvian region of Tarapacá, Peruvians were a minority, behind both Chileans and Bolivians.

===Boundary Treaty of 1866===

Bolivia and Chile negotiated the &quot;Boundary Treaty of 1866,&quot; or the &quot;Treaty of Mutual Benefits,&quot; which established 24° S &quot;from the littoral of the Pacific to the eastern limits of Chile&quot; as the mutual boundary. Both countries also agreed to share the tax revenue from mineral exports from the territory between 23° and 25° S. The bipartite tax collecting caused discontent, and the treaty lasted for only eight years.

=== Secret Treaty of Alliance of 1873 ===

In February 1873, Peru and Bolivia signed a secret treaty of alliance against Chile. The last clause kept it secret as long as both parties considered its publication unnecessary, until it was revealed in 1879. Argentina, long involved in a dispute with Chile over the Strait of Magellan and Patagonia, was secretly invited to join the pact, and in September 1873, the Argentine Chamber of Deputies approved the treaty and 6,000,000 Argentine peso for war preparations. Eventually, Argentina and Bolivia did not agree on the territories of Tarija and Chaco, and Argentina also feared an alliance of Chile with Brazil. The Argentine Senate postponed and then rejected the approval, but in 1875 and 1877, after border disputes with Chile flared up anew, Argentina sought to join the treaty. At the onset of the war, in a renewed attempt, Peru offered Argentina the Chilean territories from 24° to 27° S if Argentina adhered to the pact and fought in the war.

Historians including G. Bulnes, Basadre, and Yrigoyen agree that the real intention of the treaty was to compel Chile to modify its borders according to the geopolitical interests of Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia, as Chile was militarily weak before the arrival of the Chilean ironclads Almirante Cochrane and Blanco Encalada.

Chile was not informed about the pact until it learned of it, at first cursorily by a leak in the Argentine Congress in September 1873, when the Argentine Senate discussed the invitation to join the Peru-Bolivia alliance. The Peruvian mediator Antonio de Lavalle stated in his memoirs that he did not learn of it until March 1879, and Hilarion Daza was not informed of the pact until December 1878.

The Peruvian historian Basadre states that one of Peru&#x27;s reasons for signing the treaty was to impede a Chilean-Bolivian alliance against Peru that would have given to Bolivia the region of Arica (almost all Bolivian commerce went through Peruvian ports of Arica before the war) and transferred Antofagasta to Chile. The Chilean offers to Bolivia to change allegiance were made several times even during the war and also from the Bolivian side at least six times.

On 26 December 1874, the recently built ironclad Cochrane arrived in Valparaíso and remained in Chile until the completion of the Blanco Encalada. That threw the balance of power in the South Pacific toward Chile.

Historians disagree on how to interpret the treaty. Some Peruvian and Bolivian historians assess it as rightful, defensive, circumstantial, and known by Chile from the very onset. Conversely, some Chilean historians assess the treaty as aggressive against Chile, causing the war, designed to take control by Peru of the Bolivian nitrate and hidden from Chile. The reasons for its secrecy, its invitation to Argentina to join the pact, and Peru&#x27;s refusal to remain neutral are still discussed.

=== Boundary Treaty of 1874 ===

In 1874, Chile and Bolivia replaced the 1866 boundary treaty by keeping the boundary at 24° S but granting Bolivia the authority to collect all tax revenue between 23° and 24° S. To compensate for the relinquishment of its rights, Chile received a 25-year guarantee against tax increases on Chilean commercial interests and their exports.

Article 4 explicitly forbade tax increases on Chilean enterprises for 25 years: 
All disputes arising under the treaty would be settled by arbitration.

===Causes of war===


The historian William F. Sater gives several possible and compatible reasons for the war. He considers the causes to be domestic, economic, and geopolitical. Several authors agree with them, but others only partially support his arguments.

Some historians argue that Chile was devastated by the economic crisis of the 1870s and was looking for a replacement for its silver, copper and wheat exports. It has been argued that the economic situation and the view of new wealth in nitrate were the true reasons for the Chilean elite to go to war against Peru and Bolivia. The holder of the Chilean nitrate companies, according to Sater, &quot;bulldozed&quot; Chilean President Aníbal Pinto into declaring war to protect the owner of the &quot;Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta&quot; (CSFA) and then to seize Bolivia&#x27;s and Peru&#x27;s salitreras (saltpeter works). Several members of the Chilean government were shareholders of CSFA, and they are believed to have hired the services of one of the country&#x27;s newspapers to push their case.

Another US American historian, David Healy, rejects that thesis, and Fredrick B. Pike calls the allegation &quot;absurd.&quot; The economic development that accompanied and followed the war was so remarkable that Marxist writers feel justified in alleging that Chile&#x27;s great military adventure was instigated by self-seeking capitalists to bring their country out of the business stagnation that had begun in 1878 since the war provided Chile with the economic means to come of age. Sater states that that interpretation overlooks certain important facts. The Chilean investors in Bolivia correctly feared that Daza, the Bolivian dictator, would use the war as an excuse to expropriate their investments. Among them were Melchor de Concha y Toro, the politically powerful president of Chile&#x27;s Camara de Diputados, Jerónimo Urmeneta, and Lorenzo Claro, a Chilean founder of the Banco de Bolivia and a prominent member of the National Party. A Santiago newspaper claimed that Melchor de Concha y Toro offered President Pinto 2,000,000 Chilean pesos to end the dispute and to return to the 1874 border. &quot;In other words,&quot; writes W. Sater, &quot;there were as many powerful interests opposed to helping the Compañía de Salitres as there were those seeking to aid the corporation.&quot; Also, B. Farcau objects to the argument: &quot;On the other hand, the sorry state of the Chilean armed forces at the outbreak of the war, as will be discussed in the following chapter, hardly supports a theory of conscious, premeditated aggression.&quot;

Sater cites other sources that state that the true causes of the conflict were not economic but geopolitical, a struggle for control of the southeastern portion of the Pacific Ocean. In 1836 the Peruvian government tried to monopolize commerce in the South Pacific by rewarding ships that sailed directly to Callao, to the detriment of Valparaíso. Peru tried to impede the agreement that had been reached between Spain and Chile to free its new warships built and embargoed in Britain during the Chincha Islands War. Sater cites Germany&#x27;s minister in Chile, who argued that the war with Peru and Bolivia would &quot;have erupted sooner or later, [and] on any pretext.&quot; He considered that Bolivia and Peru had developed a &quot;bitter envy&quot; against Chile and its material progress and good government. Frederik B. Pike states: &quot;The fundamental cause for the eruption of hostilities was the mounting power and prestige and the economic and political stability of Chile, on one hand, and the weakness and the political and economic deterioration of Bolivia, on the other... The war—and its outcome—was as inevitable as the 1846—1848 conflict between the United States and Mexico. In both instances, a relatively well-governed, energetic, and economically expanding nation had been irresistibly tempted by neighboring territories that were underdeveloped, malgoverned, and sparsely occupied.&quot;

Another reason, according to Sater, was Peru&#x27;s desire to monopolize and appropriate the nitrate works to strengthen its nitrate monopoly, which required the Bolivian and Chilean salitreras to be controlled by Peru. As unenviable as Chile’s situation was in the 1870s, that of Peru was much worse. The 1870s was for Peru&#x27;s economy &quot;a decade of crisis and change&quot;. Nitrate extraction rose while guano exports, the source of substantial revenue for Peru, declined from 575,000 tons in 1869 to less than 350,000 tons in 1873, and the Chincha Islands and other guano islands were depleted or nearly so.

William Edmundson writes in &quot;A History of the British Presence in Chile&quot;, &quot;Peru has its own reasons to enter the dispute. Rory Miller (1993) argues that the depletion of guano resources and poor management of the economy in Peru had provoked a crisis. This has caused Peru to default on its external debt in 1876... In that year [1875] the Peruvian government decided to procure a loan of seven millions pounds of which four millions pounds were earmarked to purchase privately owned oficinas [salitreras]... and Peru defaulted again in 1877.&quot;

To increase guano revenue, Peru created a monopoly on nitrate commerce in 1875. Its aims were to increase prices, curb exports and to impede competition, but most larger nitrate firms opposed the monopoly on sales of nitrate. When they were unsuccessful, Peru in 1876 began to expropriate nitrate producers and to buy nitrate concessions such as that of Henry Meiggs in Bolivia (&quot;Toco&quot;, south of the Loa River). However, the CSFA was too expensive to be purchased. As Peruvian historian Alejandro Reyes states, the Bolivian salitreras needed to be controlled, which resulted in the internationalization of the conflict since they were owned by Chilean and European merchants. As the Chilean company was to be auctioned on 14 February 1879, in Antofagasta, it was considered that the Peruvian consul would be the highest bidder.

However, some sources, according to Sater, see the declarations of war between Chile and Peru as a product of popular domestic forces. The Peruvian President had to declare war to keep his position. Sater cites the British minister in Lima, Spencer St. John: &quot;the rival parties may try to make political capital out of jealousy for the national honor, and His Excellency [Peruvian President Prado] may be forced to give way to the popular sentiment.&quot; Chilean President Pinto was under similar pressures. Bruce Farcau considers that to be the main cause for the war outbreak: &quot;The argument that the attitude of the peoples of the region was just ripe for war seems best to fit the bill.&quot;

== Crisis ==
=== Ten Cents&#x27; Tax ===
;License of 27 November 1873

Beginning in 1866, the Chilean entrepreneurs and Francisco Puelma exploited deposits of sodium nitrate in Bolivian territory (the &quot;salitreras&quot; named &quot;Las Salinas&quot; and &quot;Carmen Alto&quot;, and from Antofagasta, respectively) and secured concessions from Bolivian President Mariano Melgarejo.

In 1868, a company named &quot;Compañía Melbourne Clark&quot; was established in Valparaíso, Chile, with 34% British capital provided by Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons of London, which also held shares of salitreras in Peru. Its shareholders included a number of leading Chilean politicians. The company obtained a license from the Melgarejo administration to construct a railroad from Antofagasta to Salinas, and was renamed &quot;Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta&quot; (CSFA).

In 1871, a new Bolivian government canceled all contracts signed by Melgarejo, but on 22 November 1872, a Bolivian decree allowed the government to renegotiate the contracts.

On 27 November 1873, CSFA obtained a license from the new administration in Bolivia to exploit saltpeter without duty for 15 years, but a dispute arose regarding whether the original 1872 decree, under which the 1873 license was issued, required the authorization of the Bolivian Congress. Some lawyers placed emphasis on &quot;con cargo a dar cuenta a la próxima legislatura&quot; (Spanish for: &quot;to be considered during the next legislative session [of the parliament]&quot;), but others on &quot;sólo en los casos de no avenimiento&quot; (Spanish for &quot;only in cases that no settlement [is reached]&quot;).

;Peruvian monopoly of saltpeter
In 1873, the Peruvian government dictated the &quot;Ley del estanco del salitre&quot;, which limited the saltpeter production and authorized the government to purchase the whole production to a fixed price. However, the plan failed, and the law was repealed. In 1875, the Peruvian government expropriated the salitreras of Tarapacá to create a monopoly in guano and nitrate, and in 1876, Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons became the consignee of the nitrate trade for the Peruvian government. President Mariano Ignacio Prado was &quot;determined to complete the monopoly,&quot; and in 1876, Peru bought the nitrate licenses for &quot;El Toco&quot; auctioned by a Bolivian decree of 13 January 1876. However, the Chilean company remained the most serious competitor and clearly weakened Peru&#x27;s monopoly. President Pardo, Prado&#x27;s predecessor, had urged Gibbs to secure the monopoly by limiting the CSFA&#x27;s output, and Henry Gibbs had warned the CSFA&#x27;s board of directors in a letter on 16 April 1878, that its refusal to limit its output would bring administrative trouble with Peru and Bolivia &quot;as it is made more and more to the interest of a neighboring Government that they should be so.&quot;

Gibbs made repeated unsuccessful efforts in 1876 and 1877 to persuade Edwards, the Chilean majority shareholder, to accept a limit to its production.

The historian Ronald Bruce St. John in &quot;Foreign Policy of Peru&quot; states, &quot;Although persuasive evidence linking Peru to either the ten-centavo tax or Bolivia&#x27;s decision to confiscate Chilean holdings in Antofagasta never surfaced, it must be recognized that Peruvian interests had deep-seated economical and political reasons for going to war.&quot;

;Tax and Chilean refusal
In 1875, the city of Antofagasta had attempted to impose a 3 cents tax on the CSFA, but the Bolivian State Council (Consejo de Estado), headed by Serapio Reyes Ortiz, who would be Minister of Foreign Affairs during the crisis, rejected the tax because it violated the license of 1873 and the Boundary Treaty of 1874.

On 14 February 1878, the National Congress of Bolivia and the National Constituent Assembly approved the 1873 license if the company paid a 10 cents per quintal tax, but the company objected by citing the 1874 treaty that the increased payments were illegal and demanded an intervention from the Chilean government.

The CSFA&#x27;s directory board perceived the tax as a Peruvian move to displace Chileans from the nitrate production, as had occurred in Tarapacá in 1875 when the Peruvian government expropriated the salitreras.

Having surrendered its claim to the disputed territories in return for a Bolivian promise to avoid increasing the tax, Chile claimed that the treaty did not allow for such a tax hike. Bolivia suspended the tax in April 1878. In November, Chile proposed mediation and cautioned that Daza&#x27;s refusal to cancel the tax would force Chile to declare null the 1874 treaty. In December 1878, Bolivia, counting on its military alliance with Peru, challenged Chile, stated the tax was unrelated to the treaty and that the claim of the CSFA should be addressed in Bolivian courts, and revived the tax. When the company refused to pay the tax, Bolivia confiscated its property on 11 February and threatened to sell it on 14 February to liquidate the company&#x27;s debt.

=== Chilean invasion of Antofagasta ===
In December 1878, Chile had dispatched a warship to the area. On 6 February, the Bolivian government nullified the CSFA&#x27;s exploitation license and confiscated the property. The news reached Valparaíso on 11 February and so the Chilean government decided on the occupation of the region of Antofagasta south of 23° South. On the day of the planned auction, 200 Chilean soldiers arrived by ship at the port city of Antofagasta and seized it without resistance. The occupying forces received widespread support from the local population, 93–95% of which was Chilean.

The Bolivian territory between 23° South and the Loa River, the border with Peru, remained unoccupied by Chilean forces almost one month after the Bolivian declaration of war. On 21 March, Cobija and then Calama, Tocopilla, and other hamlets were occupied. The Chilean government asked the Bolivian office-holders to remain in office, but they refused.

===Peruvian mediation and Bolivian declaration of war===

On 22 February, Peru sent a diplomatic team headed by José Antonio de Lavalle to Santiago to act as a mediator between the Chilean and the Bolivian governments. Peru meanwhile ordered its fleet and army to prepare for war. De Lavalle arrived in Valparaíso on 4 March. On 27 February, Daza had made a public manifesto to inform the Bolivians on the occupation of Antofagasta and to call for patriotic support. The same day, the Bolivian legislature authorized a formal declaration of war upon Chile although it was not immediately announced. On 1 March, Daza issued instead a decree to prohibit all commerce and communications with Chile &quot;while the state-of-war provoked upon Bolivia lasts.&quot; It provided Chileans ten days to leave Bolivian territory unless they were gravely ill or handicapped and embargoed Chilean furniture, property, and mining produce; allowed Chilean mining companies to continue operating under a government-appointed administrator; and provided all embargoes as temporary &quot;unless the hostilities exercised by Chilean forces requires an energetic retaliation from Bolivia.&quot;

In Santiago, Lavalle asked for Chile&#x27;s withdrawal from Antofagasta to transfer the province to a tripartite administration of Bolivia, Chile, and Peru without Bolivia guaranteeing to end the embargo or to cancel the new tax.

On 14 March, in a meeting with foreign powers in Lima, Bolivia announced that a state of war existed with Chile. The declaration was aimed to impede further Chilean arms purchases in Europe and to scuttle the Peruvian mediation in Chile. Bolivia called on Peru to activate the treaty of alliance arguing that Chile&#x27;s invasion was a &quot;casus foederis&quot;.

Also on 14 March, Alejandro Fierro, Chile&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs, sent a telegram to Chile&#x27;s representative in Lima, Joaquin Godoy, to request the immediate neutrality of the Peruvian government. On March 17, Godoy formally presented the Chilean proposal in a meeting with Peruvian President Prado.

On 21 March, Godoy telegraphed the Chilean government on the secret treaty between Peru and Bolivia, which had been revealed to him by Peruvian President Prado.

On 23 March, on their way to occupy Calama, 554 Chilean troops and cavalry defeated 135 Bolivian soldiers and civilians, who were dug in at two destroyed bridges next to the Topáter ford. The Battle of Topáter was the first battle of the war.

When the Chilean government asked Lavalle directly and officially whether a defensive alliance existed that committed Peru to assist Bolivia in a war with Chile and whether Lima planned to honor the agreement, Lavalle could prevaricate no longer and answered yes to both. Chilean President Pinto sought and received legislative approval to declare war, which he did on 5 April 1879. Peru responded on 6 April, when Prado declared the &quot;casus foederis&quot;.

==War==
=== Forces ===

Historians agree that the belligerents were not prepared for the war financially or militarily. None of the three nations had a General Staff, medical corps, or military logistics and their warships were in a deplorable state. In Chile, for example, the military contingent had been reduced continuously from 3,776 (by 1867) to 2,400 (by 1879) men, and no military unit was deployed north of Valparaíso, 1700 km south of Iquique. By the end of the war, 53% of chief engineers serving in Chilean warships were foreigners. The government of Peru was again in default of payment, and in Bolivia, famine spread over the country.

According to William Sater, Chile and Peru enlisted temporarily 2% of the male population but Bolivia only 1%. After the Battle of Tacna, both of the Allied armies were disbanded and had to be formed again.

The Allied forces, at first glance, had some advantages over the Chilean forces. Their population and armies doubled the Chileans in numbers, and the Peruvian port of Callao&#x27;s powerful artillery was impregnable for the Chilean navy and a secure haven for the Peruvian navy. In Callao, an English company offered the service of a floating dock for ships up to 3000 tonnes, and the Peruvian government used it to repair their ships at the outset of the war. Those are some reasons that led the international press to expect a Chilean defeat as the war started. Moreover, the ambivalent Argentine position and the ongoing Mapuche conflict overshadowed the Chilean perspective. Jorge Basadre commented on the public opinion in Peru and Bolivia: &quot;They ignored the real power of Chile and the horrors of war, and simple minded people believed that the Allied would win the war because they together were bigger than Chile.&quot;

However, other observers made a more in-depth analysis, which showed Chilean political and military advantages. Chile had a stable political system since 1833 that had developed and strengthened its institutions. The Chilean army and the navy had educated officers, soldiers with professional experience in the Mapuche conflict, and uniformly modern arms. Almost all Chilean soldiers were armed with Comblain or Gras rifles. The Chilean navy also possessed two new ironclads, which were invincible against the older Peruvian warships. Although there was interference between military and government over policy during the war, the primacy of the government was never questioned. The Chilean supply line from Europe through the Magellan Strait was only once threatened unsuccessfully by the Peruvian navy.

The Allied armies were heavily involved in domestic politics and neglected their military duties, and poor planning and administration caused them to buy different rifles with different calibers. That hampered the instruction of conscripts, the maintenance of arms, and the supply of ammunition. The Peruvian navy warships manned before the war by Chilean sailors had to be replaced by foreign crews when the war began. Bolivia had no navy. The Allied armies had nothing comparable to the Chilean cavalry and artillery.

=== Struggle for sea control ===


Its few roads and railroad lines made the nearly waterless and largely unpopulated Atacama Desert difficult to occupy. From the beginning, naval superiority was critical. Bolivia had no navy and so on 26 March 1879, Hilarión Daza formally offered letters of marque to any ships willing to fight for Bolivia. The &quot;Armada de Chile&quot; and the &quot;Marina de Guerra del Perú&quot; fought the naval battles.

Early on, Chile blockaded the Peruvian port of Iquique on 5 April.
In the Battle of Iquique, on 21 May 1879, the Peruvian ironclad &quot;Huáscar&quot; engaged and sank the wooden &quot;Esmeralda&quot;. Meanwhile, during the Battle of Punta Gruesa, the Peruvian ironclad &quot;Independencia&quot; struck a submerged rock and sank in the shallow waters near Punta Gruesa while chasing the schooner &quot;Covadonga&quot;. Peru broke the blockade of Iquique, and Chile lost the old &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, but the loss of the &quot;Independencia&quot; cost Peru 40% of its naval offensive power. It also made a strong impression upon military leaders in Argentina, and the possibility of Argentina&#x27;s intervention in the war became far more remote.

Despite being outnumbered, the Peruvian monitor &quot;Huáscar&quot; held off the Chilean Navy for six months and upheld Peru&#x27;s morale during the early stages of the conflict.

The capture of the steamship &quot;Rímac&quot; on 23 July 1879, carrying a cavalry regiment (the &quot;Carabineros de Yungay&quot;) was the Chilean Army&#x27;s largest loss until then. That led to the resignation of Contraalmirante (Rear Admiral) Juan Williams Rebolledo, the chief of the Chilean Navy, on 17 August. Commodore Galvarino Riveros Cárdenas replaced him and devised a plan to catch the &quot;Huáscar&quot;.

Meanwhile, the Peruvian navy pursued other actions, particularly in August 1879 when the &quot;Unión&quot; unsuccessfully raided Punta Arenas, near the Strait of Magellan, in an attempt to capture the British merchant ship &quot;Gleneg&quot;, which was transporting weapons and supplies to Chile.

The Battle of Angamos proved decisive on 8 October 1879, and Peru was reduced almost exclusively to land forces. In the battle, the Chilean Navy captured the &quot;Huáscar&quot; after several hours of fierce fighting, even though her surviving crewmen sought to scuttle her. The Chilean Navy was thereafter free to carry troops for the invasion of Peru and to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating in the conflict areas. Chilean warships also had to impose a naval blockade of Peruvian ports and end the smuggling of arms from Panama into Peru via the Pacific.

After the battle, despite the loss of both of Peru&#x27;s main ships, the Peruvians used simple and ingenious ruses to sink two important Chilean ships, the &quot;Loa&quot; (July 1880) and the &quot;Covadonga&quot; (August 1880), but its remaining vessels were locked in Callao during its long blockade by the Chileans.

On the other hand, the Chilean Navy captured the ship &quot;Pilcomayo&quot; in November 1879 and the torpedo boat &quot;Alay&quot; in December 1880.

When Lima fell after the Battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores, the Peruvian naval officers scuttled their remaining fleet to prevent its capture by the Chilean forces.

During the Sierra campaign, Chilean ships were dedicated to guarding the Peruvian coast and transporting military detachments and war material for land operations.

In November 1883, during the final phase of the war, the Chilean military command sent the to Lake Titicaca, via railroad, from Mollendo to Puno to control that lake. The presence of the torpedo boat prevented communications through this route and its use for military purposes, and the Peruvian vessels that had taken refuge in the vicinity surrendered to the Chileans. The deployment of the torpedo boat also induced the Bolivian government to agree to a peace treaty with Chile in 1884.

=== Land war ===

After the Battle of Angamos, once Chile achieved naval supremacy, the government had to decide where to strike. The options were Tarapacá, Moquegua or directly Lima. Because of its proximity to Chile and the capture of the Peruvian &quot;Salitreras&quot;, Chile decided to occupy the Peruvian province of Tarapacá first.

Arica and Iquique were isolated and separated by the Atacama Desert; since the capture of the Huáscar in October 1879, neither port had naval protection needed to be adequately supplied by sea. Without any communication or withdrawal lines, the area was essentially cut off from the rest of Peru. After the loss of its naval capabilities, Peru had the option to withdraw to central Peru to strengthen its army around Lima until the re-establishment of a naval balance or to build up new alliances, as hinted by the Chilean historian Wilhelm Ekdahl. However, Jorge Basadre assumes that it would have been &quot;striking and humiliating&quot; to abandon Tarapacá, the source of Peru&#x27;s wealth.

On 30 April 1879, after 13 days of marching, 4,500 Bolivian soldiers, commanded by Daza, arrived in Tacna, a town 100 km (60 mi) north of Arica. The Bolivians had come to join the Peruvian forces, commanded by Juan Buendia. The Allied forces were deployed to the places that a Chilean landing could be expected; the Iquique-Pisagua or Arica-Tacna regions. There were reserves stationed at Arequipa, farther north in Peru, under Lizardo Montero, as well as in southern Bolivia, under Narciso Campero The reserves were to be deployed to the coast after a landing but failed to arrive.

The land war can be seen as four Chilean military campaigns that successively occupied Tarapacá, Arica-Tacna, and Lima and a final campaign that ended the Peruvian resistance in the sierra. The occupation of Arequipa and Puno at the end of the war saw little military action.

==== Tarapacá Campaign====

The Campaign of Tarapacá began on November 2, 1879, when nine steam transporters escorted by half of the Chilean Navy transported 9,500 men and more than 850 animals to Pisagua, some north of Antofagasta. After neutralizing the coastal batteries, the Chileans landed and attacked beach defenses in Pisagua.

In the event of a Chilean landing, the Allied forces planned to counterattack the Chilean forces in a pincer movement involving advances from the north (Daza&#x27;s forces coming from Arica) and from the south (Buendia&#x27;s forces coming from Iquique). Although Peruvian forces marched northwards as planned after the fall of Pisagua, Daza, coming from Arica, decided in Camarones (44 km from Pisagua) to give up his part of the counterattack and return to Arica.

The Chileans meanwhile marched towards Iquique and, on 19 November 1879, defeated the Allied troops without Daza&#x27;s men gathered in Agua Santa in the Battle of San Francisco and Dolores. Disbanded Bolivian forces there and the southern force retreated to Oruro, and the Peruvians fell back to Tiliviche. The Chilean army captured Iquique (80 km/50 mi south of Pisagua) without resistance. Some of the Peruvian forces that had been defeated at San Francisco retreated on Tarapacá, a little town with same name as the province, where they combined with Peruvian troops who withdrew to Tarapacá directly from Iquique.

A detachment of Chilean soldiers, with cavalry and artillery, was sent to face the Peruvian forces in Tarapacá. Both sides clashed on 27 November in the Battle of Tarapacá, and the Chilean forces were defeated, but the Peruvian forces, without lines of communication with their supply bases in Peru or Bolivia, could not maintain their occupation of the territory. Consequently, the Peruvians retreated north through harsh desert terrain to Arica and lost many troops during their withdrawal. Bruce W. Farcau comments that, &quot;The province of Tarapacá was lost along with a population of 200,000, nearly one tenth of the Peruvian total, and an annual gross income of £28 million in nitrate production, virtually all of the country&#x27;s export earnings.&quot; The victory afforded Santiago an economic boon and a potential diplomatic asset.

==== Domestic policies until the fall of Iquique ====
The &quot;Rimac&quot;’s capture, the sinking of the &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, and the passiveness of the Chilean fleet showed that the command of the navy was unprepared for the war, and the army also had trouble with the logistics, medical service, and command. Public discontent with poor decisions led to riots, and the government had to replace the &quot;sclerotics&quot; chief of the navy Juan Williams Rebolledo (by Galvarino Riveros), and the Chief of the army Justo Arteaga (by Erasmo Escala). After Tarapacá, the army was reorganized into divisions.
Chile&#x27;s foreign policy tried to separate Bolivia from Peru. Gonzalo Bulnes writes: &quot;The target of the &quot;política boliviana&quot; was the same as before, to seize Tacna and Arica for Bolivia and put Bolivia as a buffer state between Peru and Chile, on the assumption that Peru would accept the Chilean peace conditions. The initiated called such policy &#x27;to clear up Bolivia.&#x27;&quot; Moreover, the Chilean government had to find a border agreement with Argentina to avoid war.

After the occupation of the salpeter and guano deposits, the Chilean government restituted the &quot;oficinas salitreras&quot;, which had been nationalized by Peru, to the owner of the certificate of debt. The alternative of a Chilean State Company of Salpeter was discarded as too onerous for a government waging war and lacking experienced personnel, and the creditors pressed the issue. In 1879, Chile began to exact a tax of 40 cents per &quot;quintal métrico&quot; (100 kg), increasing to $1.60 in 1880.

As provided by the secret treaty, the allies agreed in the Protocol of Subsidies for Bolivia to bear the costs of the war. The agreement, which regulated the tax income for many years, caused resentments and fears in Bolivia, whose deployment of forces to Tacna was seen as helping Peru. Also, Bolivia knew that its army would be sent not to free the occupied region of Bolivia but to protect Peru. As Daza and his officers came to Tacna and Arica, they failed to see the expected Peruvian military strength and understood that their position of power in Bolivia was threatened by a defeat of the Allies. The Bolivian historian Querejazu suggests that Daza successfully used the Chilean offer of Tacna and Arica for Bolivia to exert pressure on Peru to get a more favorable Protocol of Subsidies.

The reason that Daza abandoned the Peruvian forces in Iquique and turned back to Arica just before the Battle of San Francisco is uncertain. Some historians say that he wanted to keep the &quot;Regimiento Colorados&quot; untouched since the force secured his political power in Bolivia. Daza later stated that his officers refused to continue the march through the desert, but his shameful withdrawal accelerated his downfall, and he was succeeded by Narciso Campero. In the new government, there was a strong tendency to accept the Chilean offer of Tacna and Arica, but it was eventually refused. Bolivia signed the creation of the United States of Peru and Bolivia, a political fantasy without any practical consequences. Bolivia helped Peru with money and weapons, but the Bolivian army never again intervened in the war.

In Peru, the political situation was complicated. President Prado had declared war on Chile for longstanding economical and political reasons but without the funds or international credit to finance the war. He turned over the administration of the state to Vice President Luis La Puerta de Mendoza to assume for himself the command of the army. Because of the Chilean blockade, Peru could not export revenuemaking goods via its ports. As a consequence, public revenue was half of what had been expected, and spending tripled. The Peruvian government in 1879 experienced several political crises and seven ministers of finance. General Buendía, who led the defeated allied troops in Iquique, and More, chief of the sunken warship &quot;Independence&quot;, were both put on trial but were eventually acquitted.

The Peruvian government was confronted with widespread rioting in Lima because of its failures. On 18 December 1879, as the fall of Iquique became known in Peru, Prado went from Callao to Panama, allegedly with the duty to oversee the purchase of new arms and warships for the nation. In a statement for the Peruvian newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot;, he turned over the command of the country to Vice President Luis La Puerta de Mendoza. History has condemned his departure as a desertion. Nicolás de Piérola overthrew Puerta&#x27;s government and took power on 23 December 1879.

Piérola has been criticised because of his sectarianism, frivolous investment, bombastic decrees, and lack of control in the budget, but it must be said that he put forth an enormous effort to obtain new funds and to mobilize the country for the war. Basadre considered his work an act of heroism, abnegation in a country invaded, politically divided, militarily battered, and economically bloodless.

==== Campaign of Tacna and Arica ====


Meanwhile, Chile continued its advances in the Tacna and Arica Campaign. On 28 November, ten days after the Battle of San Francisco, Chile declared the formal blockade of Arica. On 31 December, a Chilean force of 600 men carried out an amphibious raid at Ilo as a reconnaissance in force, to the north of Tacna and withdrew the same day.

===== Lynch&#x27;s Expedition =====

On 24 February 1880, approximately 11,000 men in 19 ships, protected by &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot;, &quot;Toro&quot;, and &quot;Magallanes&quot; and two torpedo boats, sailed from Pisagua. Two days later, on 26 February, the Chileans arrived off Punta Coles, near Pacocha, Ilo. The landing took several days to conclude but faced no resistance. The Peruvian commander, Lizardo Montero, refused to try to drive the Chileans from the beachhead, as the Chileans had expected. On 22 March, 3,642 Chilean troops defeated 1,300 Peruvian troops in the Battle of Los Ángeles, cutting any direct Peruvian supply from Lima to Arica or Tacna (supply was possible only through the long way, via Bolivia). After the Battle of Los Ángeles, only three allied positions remained in southern Peru: General Leyva&#x27;s 2nd Army at Arequipa (including some survivors from Los Ángeles), Bolognesi&#x27;s 7th and 8th Divisions at Arica, and at Tacna the 1st Army. These forces were under Campero&#x27;s direct command. However, the numbers proved meaningless, as the Peruvians were unable to concentrate troops or even to move from their garrisons. After crossing of desert, on 26 May the Chilean army (14,147 men) destroyed the allied army of 5,150 Bolivians and 8,500 Peruvians in the Battle of Tacna. The need for a port near the army to supply and reinforce the troops and to evacuate the wounded compelled the Chilean command to concentrate on the remaining Peruvian stronghold of Arica. On 7 June, after the Battle of Arica, the last Peruvian bastion in the Tacna Department fell. After the campaign of Tacna and Arica, the Peruvian and Bolivian regular armies largely ceased to exist, and Bolivia effectively left the war.
===== Lackawanna Conference =====
On 22 October 1880, delegates of Peru, Chile, and Bolivia held a 5-day conference aboard the in Arica. The meeting had been arranged by the United States Ministers Plenipotentiary in the belligerent countries. The Lackawanna Conference, also called the Arica Conference, attempted to develop a peace settlement.

Chile demanded Peruvian Tarapacá Province and the Bolivian Atacama, an indemnity of 20,000,000 gold pesos, the restoration of property taken from Chilean citizens, the return of the &quot;Rimac&quot;, the abrogation of the treaty between Peru and Bolivia, and a formal commitment not to mount artillery batteries in Arica&#x27;s harbor. Arica, as a settlement, was to be limited to commercial use. Chile planned to retain the territories of Moquegua, Tacna, and Arica until all peace treaty conditions were satisfied. Although willing to accept the negotiated settlement, Peru and Bolivia insisted for Chile to withdraw its forces from all occupied lands as a precondition for discussing peace. Having captured the territory at great expense, Chile declined, and the negotiations failed. Bruce St. John states in &quot;Foreign Policy of Peru&quot; (p. 116), &quot;Peru attended only out of deference to the [US government] latter, hoping a failure of the talks might lead to more aggressive US involvement.&quot;

==== Campaign of Lima ====


The occupation of the southern departments of Peru (Tacna, Arica, and Tarapacá) and the Lynch expedition showed that the army of Peru no longer possessed the skilled military manpower to defend the country. However, nothing could convince the Peruvian government to sue for peace. The defeated allies failed to realize their situation and, despite the empty Bolivian treasury, on 16 June 1880, the Bolivian National Assembly voted to continue the war. On 11 June 1880, a document was signed in Peru declaring the creation of the United States of Peru-Bolivia, but Piérola continued the struggle. W. Sater states, &quot;Had Piérola sued for peace in June 1880, he would have saved countless Peruvian lives and the nation&#x27;s treasure.&quot;

The Chilean government struggled to satisfy the public demands to end the war and to secure the peace. The situation forced the Chilean government to plan the occupation of Lima.

;Landings on Pisco, Chilca, Curayaco, and Lurín
Once the size of the Chilean army had been increased by 20,000 men to reach a strength of 41,000 soldiers, deployed from the forts of the Chile–Mapuche frontier to the outskirts of Lima, the Chilean army began the campaign of Lima. Lacking the ships to transport all the troops at once from Arica, the Chileans decided to land a division and then the rest of the army in stages. Their shortage of shipping also precluded an immediate landing at Lima. Instead, Pisco, approximately south of Lima, was the first landing point.

On 19 November, 8,800 men, twenty cannons and their supplies reached Pisco. A party of 400 men was landed near the port and they learned that a garrison of 3,000 men defended Pisco. Bypassing it required a landing to be made directly into the port and so a Chilean vanguard was landed in Paracas, ten miles to the south. The force managed to capture Pisco and on 20 November the rest of the Chilean troops landed, later occupying various other nearby coastal cities, securing for the Chileans de facto control of the Peruvian province of Ica.

On 2 December, 3,500 additional men and 416 horses disembarked in Pisco. Some two weeks later, on 15 December, 14,000 Chilean men, 2,400 horses and mules, and supplies left Arica for the north. Baquedano, the Chilean commander, decided that only one brigade in the Pisco region, Lynch&#x27;s brigade, would march the north to the coastal town of Chilca, a town only from Lima. All other Chilean forces would be re-embarked in Pisco for naval transport to Chilca. The Chilean troops disembarked in Curayaco, slightly north of Chilca, on 22 December 1880. The artillery was later disembarked at Lurín, on the southern outskirts of Lima, as the Chilean army was able to advance quickly after landing.

Piérola, who had expected a landing north of Lima, ordered the construction of two parallel lines of Peruvian defences, one at Chorrillos and one at Miraflores. It was hoped that the Peruvian professional Army would defeat the Chileans in Chorrillos. If that measure failed, a reserve army, increased with remnants of Chorrillos and the Callao troops, were expected to hold the Chilean advance at Miraflores. The Peruvian forces numbered approximately 25,000 to 32,000 men and were titled the Army of Lima.

The main Peruvian defense line ran from the seaside resort of Chorrillos through Morro Solar, Santa Teresa, San Juan, the Pamplona (hills) until Monterrico Chico, a line of defence approximately 15 km long. Gatling guns, artillery, covering forts and trenches located along the top of the steeply natural hills (280 m in Morro Solar, 170 m in Sta. Teresa and San Juan) and minefields around the roads to Lima crossing the hamlets of San Juan and Santa Teresa, settlements that the Peruvians anticipated would be important targets of the Chilean attack, all of which were used by the Peruvian military.

The second line of defense was less strong, consisting of 7 redoubts (one every 800 meters) for infantry and artillery, which the Peruvians hoped would stop any Chilean offensive.

The Chilean General Staff had two plans for the attack. Baquedano, the army chief, advocated a direct and frontal advance through the Tablada de Lurín. The area was known, with large areas of relatively flat terrain against the line of Chorrillos. The advantages of that path of advance were the shorter distances to be covered, a withdrawal line, the possibility of support from the Chilean navy, water supply from Lurín, and less need to train troops and the complex Chilean discipline to control any advance and subsequent attack. The alternative plan of War Minister José Francisco Vergara laid down a turning movement that would bypass the Peruvian line by attacking from further to the east: through the Lurín valley, moving via Chantay and reaching Lima at Ate. Using that approach meant that Lima could be seized without resistance or both defense lines could be attacked from the rear.

Vergara&#x27;s plan avoided the bloody frontal attack, circumvented all defense works, cut any Peruvian withdrawal line to the east into the formidable Andes, and demoralized the Peruvians. However, there were no steady roads for movement of Chilean artillery and baggage, no water to allow navy support, and many bottlenecks in which a small force might stop the whole Chilean army on the way to Lima or if it had to withdraw. In addition, Vergara&#x27;s plan required a well-trained and disciplined army. Baquedano pushed and eventually succeeded in having his plan adopted.

; Battle of Chorrillos and Miraflores

In the afternoon of 12 January 1881, three Chilean formations (referred to as divisions) stepped off from Lurín toward Chorrillos at about 4:00, reaching their attack positions at around 3:00 the next morning. At 5:00 a.m. an assault was begun on the Peruvian forts. Lynch&#x27;s division charged Iglesias&#x27;s positions (Morro Solar to Santa Teresa), Sotomayor&#x27;s men against Caceres&#x27;s sector (Santa Teresa to San Juan) and Lagos&#x27;s division charged Davila&#x27;s sector (San Juan to Monterrico Chico). Chilean and Peruvian soldiers locked in hand-to-hand combat and attacked one another with rifles, bayonets, rocks and even their bare hands. At the beginning, Sotomayor was unable to deploy in time, and Lynch&#x27;s advance was repulsed. Baquedano was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage Lynch&#x27;s flank. At 8:00 a.m., the Peruvian defenders were forced to withdraw from San Juan and Santa Teresa to Morro Solar and Chorrillos (town). At noon, Morro Solar was captured and the battle continued into Chorrillos, which fell at 14:00 (2 p.m.). During the Battle of Chorrillos, the Chileans inflicted a harsh defeat on the regular Peruvian forces, eliminating Lima&#x27;s first defensive line. Two days later, the second line of defense was also penetrated in the Battle of Miraflores.

Piérola&#x27;s division of forces in two lines has been criticised by Chilean analyst Francisco Machuca. Whether such criticism is justified is debatable. According to Gonzalo Bulnes the battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores have been some of the largest in South America regarding the number of combatants, 45,000 in Chorrillos and 25,000 in Miraflores. The estimated death toll was 11,000 to 14,000 personnel, with a further 10,144 injured.

==== Domestic policies until the fall of Lima ====
On 15 June 1881 Domingo Santa María was elected president of Chile and assumed office on 18 September 1881. A new Congress was elected on schedule in 1882.

Argentina had declared itself neutral at the onset of the war but allowed the transport of weapons to the Allies over Argentine territories, exerted influence on the US and European powers to stop the Chilean advance in the war, and pleaded for monetary indemnification instead of cession of territories to Chile. There was a strong drift in its public opinion in favor of Peru and Bolivia. Moreover, there were Peruvian and Bolivian hopes that Argentina could change its stance and enter a war against Chile.

On 23 July 1881, a few months after the fall of Lima, Chile and Argentina signed the Boundary Treaty, which ceded eastern Patagonia to Argentina and control over the Strait of Magellan to Chile.

Carlos Escudé and Andrés Cisneros state that the treaty was a true victory for Argentina, but Michael Morris believes, &quot;Rearguard Argentine efforts had been made to gain recognition for some kind of shared management regime for the Strait [of Magellan], in order to mitigate what was perceived as the striking diplomatic defeat for Argentina in the 1881 treaty granting Chile control over the strait.&quot;

The situation in Bolivia stayed the same after the fall of Lima. The Bolivian government lacked the money, men, weapons, and means to transport an army to Peru.

==== War in the Peruvian Sierra ====
After the confrontations in Chorrillos and Miraflores, the Peruvian dictator Piérola refused to negotiate with the Chileans and escaped to the central Andes to try governing from the rear but soon lost the representation of the Peruvian state. (He left Peru in December 1881.)

The occupation commanders, Manuel Baquedano, Pedro Lagos, and then Patricio Lynch, had their respective military headquarters in the Government Palace, Lima. The new Chilean administration continued to push for an end to the costly war, but contrary to expectations, neither Lima&#x27;s capture nor the imposition of heavy taxes led Peru to sue for peace. Conversely, Peruvian caudillos advocated to wage a defensive war of attrition that consumed Chile&#x27;s power so much that it renounced their demand for the territory.

On 22 February 1881, the Piérola Congress, allowed by Chile, reinstated the 1860 constitution and chose Francisco García Calderón as the provisional president but he was assisted by the US minister in Lima in refusing the cession of territories to Chile. He was overthrown by the Chileans in September 1881, but before his relegation to Chile, he had appointed Lizardo Montero Flores as successor.

The Peruvian caudillos organized a resistance, which would be known as the Campaign of the Breña or Sierra, a widespread, prolonged, brutal, and eventually futile guerrilla campaign. They harassed the Chilean troops and their logistics to such a point that Lynch had to send expeditions to the valleys in the Andes.

The resistance was organised by Andrés Avelino Cáceres in the regions Cajamarca (north), Arequipa (south) and the Sierra Central (Cerro Pasco to Ayacucho) However, the collapse of national order in Peru brought on also domestic chaos and violence, most of which was motivated by class or racial divisions. Chinese and black laborers took the opportunity to assault haciendas and the property of the rich to protest their mistreatment suffered in previous years. Lima&#x27;s masses attacked Chinese grocery stores, and Indian peasants took over highland haciendas. For the occupation forces, the region was an unknown, difficult terrain, force inhibitor, insalubrious (tunga penetrans, dysentery), inaccessible, and Chilean military supplies had to be transported from Lima or other points on the coast, purchased from locals, or confiscated, each option being either very expensive or politically hazardous.

An additional problem for the Chileans was collecting information in support of their expeditionary force. While Cáceres was informed about the dispositions and moves of his foes, Chileans often did not know the whereabouts of the guerrillas. 

=====Letelier&#x27;s expedition=====

In February 1881, Chilean forces, under Lieutenant Colonel Ambrosio Letelier started the first expedition into the Sierra, with 700 men, to defeat the last guerrilla bands from Huánuco (30 April) to Junín. After many losses, the expedition achieved very little and returned to Lima in early July, where Letelier and his officers were courts-martialed for diverting money into their own pockets.

=====1882 Sierra Campaign=====
To annihilate the guerrillas in the Mantaro Valley, in January 1882, Lynch ordered an offensive with 5,000 men under the command of Gana and Del Canto, first towards Tarma and then southeast towards Huancayo, reaching Izcuchaca. Lynch&#x27;s army suffered enormous hardships including cold temperatures, snow and mountain sickness. On 9 July 1882, they fought the emblematic Battle of La Concepción. The Chileans had to pull back with a loss of 534 soldiers: 154 in combat, 277 of disease and 103 deserters.

García Calderón refused to relinquish Peruvian control over the Tarapacá Region and so was arrested. Before García Calderón left Peru for Chile, he named Admiral Lizardo Montero as his successor. At the same time, Piérola stepped back and supported Cáceres for the presidency. Cáceres refused to serve but supported Lizardo Montero. Montero moved to Arequipa and so García Calderón&#x27;s arrest unified the forces of Piérola and Cáceres.

=====1883 Sierra Campaign=====
On 1 April 1882 Miguel Iglesias, Defence Minister under Piérola, became convinced that the war had to be brought to an end or Peru would be completely devastated. He issued a manifesto, &quot;:es:Grito de Montán&quot;, calling for peace and in December 1882 convened a convention of representatives of the seven northern departments, where he was elected &quot;Regenerating President&quot; To support Iglesias against Montero, on 6 April 1883, Patricio Lynch started a new offensive to drive the guerrillas from central Peru and to destroy Caceres&#x27;s army. The Chilean troops pursued Caceres northwest through narrow mountain passes until 10 July 1883, winning the definitive Battle of Huamachuco, the final Peruvian defeat.

===Last days===
Chile and Iglesias&#x27;s government signed the Peace Treaty of Ancón on 20 October 1883, which ended the war and ceded Tarapacá to Chile.

Lizardo Montero tried to resist in Arequipa with a force of 4,000 men, but when Chile&#x27;s 3,000 fighters arrived from Mollendo, Moquegua, and Ayacucho and began the assault to Arequipa, the Peruvian troops mutinied against Montero and allowed the Chileans to occupy the city on 29 October 1883. Montero opted for a Bolivian asylum. The occupation of Ayacucho by Chilean Colonel Urriola on 1 October lasted only 40 days, as Urriola withdrew to Lima. Ayacucho was occupied by Cáceres&#x27;s new army of 500 men. Caceres continued to refuse the cession of territories to Chile.

The basis of Cáceres&#x27;s war the increasingly powerful Indian insurrection against the Chileans, which had changed the nature of the war. Indian guerrillas fought &quot;white men from all parties,&quot; looted towns, and seized land of the white owners. In June 1884, Cáceres accepted Treaty of Ancón &quot;as an accomplished fact&quot; but continued to fight Iglesias.

On Cáceres&#x27;s true reasons for his change of mind, Florencia Mallon wrote:
:Yet long before the civil war was over, it became clear to the hero of la Breña that, in order to build an alliance that would carry him to the presidential palace, he had to mend fences with the as a class, included those who had collaborated with the Chileans. The only way to do so was to give the &quot;hacendados&quot; what they wanted and repress the very guerrillas who had made the Breña campaign possible in the first place.

On 29 October 1883, the Chilean occupation of Lima ended, and on 4 August 1884, Lynch and the rest of the Chilean Expeditionary Forces embarked in Callao for Chile.

== Peace ==
=== Peace treaty between Chile and Peru ===
On 20 October 1883, hostilities between Chile and Peru formally came to an end under the Treaty of Ancón, whose terms had Peru formally cede Tarapacá Province to Chile, and the use of the guano and nitrate resources to repay Peru&#x27;s debts were regulated. Chile was also to occupy the provinces of Tacna and Arica for 10 years, when a plebiscite was to be held to determine nationality. For decades thereafter, the two countries failed to agree on the terms of the plebiscite. Finally, in 1929, mediation under US President Herbert Hoover caused the Treaty of Lima to be signed by which Chile kept Arica, and Peru reacquired Tacna.

=== Peace treaty between Bolivia and Chile ===
In 1884, Bolivia signed a truce, the Treaty of Valparaiso and accepted the military occupation of the entire Bolivian coast. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904) ceded the complete region of Antofagasta to Chile. In return, Chile agreed to build the Arica–La Paz railway to connect the capital city of La Paz, Bolivia, with the port of Arica, and Chile guaranteed freedom of transit for Bolivian commerce through Chilean ports and territory.

== Military analysis ==
=== Comparison ===
As the war began, the Peruvian Army numbered 5,241 men of all ranks, organized in seven infantry battalions, three squadrons of cavalry and two regiments of artillery. The most common rifles in the army were the French Chassepot and the Minié rifles. The artillery, with a total of 28 pieces, was composed mostly of British-made Blakely cannons and counted four machine guns. Much of the artillery dated from 1866 and had been bought for the Chincha Islands War against Spain. The mounts used by the cavalry were small and inferior to those used by the Chileans.

The Bolivian Army numbered no more than 2,175 soldiers and was divided into three infantry regiments, two cavalry squadrons, and two sections of artillery. The Colorados Battalion, President Daza&#x27;s personal guard, was armed with Remington Rolling Block rifles, but the remainder carried odds and ends including flintlock muskets. The artillery had rifled three pounders and four machine guns, and the cavalry rode mules given a shortage of good horses.

The regular Chilean Army was well equipped, with 2,694 soldiers. The regular infantry was armed with the modern Belgian Comblain rifle, of which Chile had a stock of some 13,000. Chile also had Gras, Minié, Remington and Beaumont rifles, most of which fired the same caliber cartridge (11 mm). The artillery had 75 artillery pieces, most of which were of Krupp and Limache manufacture, and six machine guns. The cavalry used French sabers and Spencer and Winchester carbines.

Control of the sea was Chile&#x27;s key to an inevitably difficult desert war: supply by sea, including water, food, ammunition, horses, fodder, and reinforcements, was quicker and easier than marching supplies through the desert or across the Bolivian high plateau. While the Chilean Navy started an economic and military blockade of the Allies&#x27; ports, Peru took the initiative and used its smaller navy as a raiding force. The raids delayed the ground invasion for six months and forced Chile to shift its fleet from blockading to hunting and capturing the &quot;Huáscar&quot;. After achieving naval supremacy, sea-mobile forces proved to be an advantage for desert warfare on the long coastline. Peruvian and Bolivian defenders found themselves hundreds of kilometers from home, but the Chilean forces were usually just a few kilometers from the sea.

The Chileans employed an early form of amphibious warfare, which saw the co-ordination of army, navy, and specialized units. The first amphibious assault of the war took place when 2,100 Chilean troops took Pisagua on November 2, 1879. Chilean Navy ships bombarded beach defenses for several hours at dawn, followed by open, oared boats landing army infantry and sapper units into waist-deep water under enemy fire. An outnumbered first landing wave fought at the beach; the second and third waves in the following hours were able to overcome resistance and move inland. By the end of the day, an expeditionary army of 10,000 had disembarked at the captured port. In 1881 Chilean ships transported approximately 30,000 men, along with their mounts and equipment, in order to attack Lima. Chilean commanders were using purpose-built, flat-bottomed landing craft that would deliver troops in shallow water closer to the beach, possibly the first purpose-built amphibious landing craft in history: &quot;These 36 shallow draft, flat-bottomed boats would be able to land three thousand men and twelve guns in a single wave.&quot;

Chile&#x27;s military strategy emphasized preemption, offensive action, and combined arms. It was the first to mobilize and deploy its forces and took the war immediately to Bolivian and Peruvian territories. It adopted combined arms strategy that used naval and ground forces to rout its allied foes and capture enemy territory. It landed ground forces in enemy territory to raid in strength to split and to drive out defenders, and it then garrisoned the territory as the fighting moved north. Chileans received the support of Chinese immigrants who had been enslaved by Peruvians and joined the Chilean Army during the campaign of Lima and in the raids to the north Peruvian cities.

Peru and Bolivia fought a defensive war, maneuvering through long overland distances and relied when possible on land or coastal fortifications with gun batteries and minefields. Coastal railways reached to central Peru, and telegraph lines provided a direct line to the government in Lima.

The occupation of Peru from 1881 and 1884 took a different form. The theater was the Peruvian Sierra, where the remains of the Peruvian Army had easy access to the population, resource, and supply centers far from the sea, which supported indefinite attrition warfare. The occupying Chilean force was split into small garrisons across the theater and could devote only part of its strength to hunting down dispersed pockets of resistance and the last Peruvian forces in the &quot;Sierra&quot;. After a costly occupation and prolonged counterinsurgency campaign, Chile sought a diplomatic exit. Rifts within Peruvian society and Peruvian defeat in the Battle of Huamachuco resulted in the peace treaty that ended the occupation.

=== Technology ===
Both sides used late 19th-century military technology, such as breech-loading rifles and cannons, remote-controlled land mines, armor-piercing shells, naval torpedoes, torpedo boats, and purpose-built landing craft. The second generation of ironclads, designed after the Battle of Hampton Roads, were used in battle for the first time. That was significant for a conflict in which no major power was involved and attracted British, French, and US observers. During the war, Peru developed the &quot;Toro Submarino&quot; (&quot;Submarine Bull&quot;), which never saw action and was scuttled at the end to prevent capture.

The USS &quot;Wachusett&quot; (1861) commanded by Alfred Thayer Mahan, was stationed at Callao, Peru, to protect American interests during the war&#x27;s final stages. Mahan formulated his concept of sea power while he was reading history in a British gentlemen&#x27;s club in Lima, Peru. The concept became the foundation for his celebrated &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot;.

=== Flow of information ===
Since 1876, a submarine cable connected Valparaíso and Lima. At the beginning of the war, Antofagasta and Iquique were connected to the cable. Both navies tried to take control of the cable or severed it according to its military and naval interests.

Lima was not connected by cable to Panama, the southernmost post of the North American cable network. Valparaíso had been connected to Buenos Aires by a cable over the Andes since 26 July 1872. Buenos Aires was connected via Uruguay and Brazil, to Portugal and Britain and, from there, to the US over a submarine cable. It must be emphasized that La Paz, Bolivia&#x27;s capital, was not connected by telegraph to the rest of the world. News coming from Tacna, Arica, and Antofagasta to La Paz had to be brought by foot or horse. The alternative way was from Peruvian port Mollendo (Querejazu: Moliendo) by railroad to Puno and then by boat service to Chichilaya, at the Bolivian shore of Lake Titicaca. The last route to La Paz was by horse or foot. The only telegraph in Bolivia was in Tupiza, south from La Paz, as the crow flies. Tupiza is at the border to Argentina and was connected to Buenos Aires via telegraph.

The traditional transport for long distances were the steamships that connected Valparaíso, Caldera, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica, and Lima to the rest of the world.

The disruption of maritime trade routes and the unavailability of submarine telegraph cables from and in the war zone presented special problems for the press coverage of the war. On the other hand, the west coast was important for investors, farmers, manufacturers, and government officials because of their financial commitments. Hence, &quot;The Times&quot; of London and &quot;The New York Times&quot; covered the events of the war as much as possible, in spite of the absence of their own correspondents. Information was culled from government representatives in Europe and the US, merchant houses and Lloyd&#x27;s of London, articles printed in the &quot;Panama Star and Herald&quot;, and Reuters.

The result was a mix of brief telegraphic dispatches a few days&#x27; old from cities with cable stations, along with lengthier but older reports carried by steamships to London or New York. For example, the Battle of Iquique occurred on 21 May, but its first mention appeared in the 30 May edition of both &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; with an incorrect message. It was only on 17 June that &quot;The Times&quot; could provide a reasonably accurate version of the battle.

=== Atrocities ===
The three nations claimed to adhere to the Geneva Red Cross Convention to protect the war wounded, prisoners, refugees, civilians, and other noncombatants.

At the onset of the war, 30,000 Chileans were expelled from Peru (within 8 days) and Bolivia (within 10 days) and their property confiscated, most of them having to shelter in the camps, boats, and pontoons of the Peruvian ports until they were transported by ship to Antofagasta. It is calculated that 7,000 of the refugees from Peru enlisted in the Chilean battalions, and their resentfulness would later influence the war. Peruvian and Bolivian residents in Chile were not expelled.

Both sides complained that the other side had killed wounded soldiers after the battle and cited eyewitness accounts.

Besides the Peruvian-Chilean slaughter in the irregular war after the occupation of Lima, an ethnic and social conflict was simmering in Peru between the indigenous peoples and (Chinese) coolies who had been enslaved by Peru&#x27;s white criollo and mestizo upper class. On 2 July 1884, the &quot;guerrillero&quot; Tomás Laymes and three of his men were executed in Huancayo by Caceres&#x27;s forces because of the atrocities and crimes committed by the guerrillas against the Peruvian inhabitants of the cities and hamlets. In Ayacucho, indigenous peoples stood up against &quot;the whites,&quot; and in Chincha, the Afro-Peruvians banded together against their owners in the Haciendas of &quot;Larán,&quot; &quot;San José,&quot; and &quot;Hoja Redonda&quot;. Only the Peruvian army could forcibly suppress the revolt.

Chinese coolies formed the battalion &quot;Vulcano&quot; within the Chilean Army. There were also interethnic tensions under blacks and coolies. For example, in Cañete, 2000 coolies from the Haciendas &quot;Montalbán&quot; and &quot;Juan de Arona&quot; were massacred by blacks.

== Foreign intervention ==
The British historian B. Farcau stated: &quot;Contrary to the concept of the &#x27;merchants of death,&#x27; the arms manufacturers of Europe and the United States conniving to keep alive the conflict, from which they had earned some welcome sales of their merchandise, the most influential foreign businessmen and their respective consuls and ambassadors were the traders in nitrate and the holders of the growing stacks of debts of all the belligerents. They were all aware that the only way they could hope to receive payment on their loans and earn the profits from the nitrate business was to see the war ended and trade resumed on a normal footing without legal disputes over ownership of the resources of the region hanging over their heads.&quot;

Nonethelesses, belligerents were able to purchase torpedo boats, arms, and munitions abroad and to circumvent ambiguous neutrality laws, and firms like Baring Brothers in London were not averse to dealing with both Chile and Peru. Arms were sold freely to any side that could pay for them but the British abstained from selling warships. For example, in 1879 to 1880, Peru acquired weapons from the United States, Europe, Costa Rica, and Panama. Weapons offloaded on the Caribbean coast of Panama were sent overland to the Pacific coast by the isthmus railway. In the Pacific, a number of ships, including the &quot;Talismán&quot;, &quot;Chalaco&quot;, &quot;Limeña&quot;, &quot;Estrella&quot;, &quot;Enriqueta&quot; and &quot;Guadiana&quot;, transported the cargo to Peru. The trade was done with the consent of the president of the Sovereign State of Panamá, then part of Colombia. The Chilean consul in Panama persistently protested the trade by citing a Chile–Colombia agreement of 1844 that prohibited Colombia from providing war supplies to Chile&#x27;s enemies.

After the Chilean occupation of Arica, Tarapacá, and Antofagasta, the governments of Peru and Bolivia turned as their last hope to the United States to block the Chilean annexation of the occupied territories. American diplomats were worried that European powers might be tempted to intervene in the Pacific. The Bolivian Minister in Washington offered US Secretary of State William Maxwell Evarts the prospects of lucrative guano and nitrate concessions to American investors in return for official protection of Bolivia&#x27;s territorial integrity. Isaac P. Christiancy, US Minister in Peru, organized the &quot;USS Lackwanna&quot; Conference, which ultimately failed, as none of the belligerents was ready to negotiate. Earlier, Christiancy had written to the US that Peru should be annexed for ten years and then admitted in the Union to provide the United States with access to the rich markets of South America.

In 1881, US President James Garfield took the oath of office, and the Anglophobic Secretary of State James G. Blaine supported an assertive role for the US in the war, ostensibly regarding the interests of promoting US ownership of nitrate and guano concessions. Blaine argued that the South American republics &quot;are young sisters of this government&quot; and so he would not tolerate European intervention in South America. The groups &quot;Credit Industriel&quot; and &quot;Peruvian Company,&quot; representing European and American creditors, had guaranteed to the Peruvian provisional government of Francisco García Calderón to pay the Peruvian external debt and the reparations to Chile, but in return, the Peruvian government had to grant mining concessions in Tarapacá to these corporations. With the acquiescence of García Calderón, both companies began to lobby in the United States for the territories to remain under Peruvian sovereignty. For example, the US &quot;Levi P. Morton, Bliss and Company&quot; would get a monopoly on the sales of Peruvian nitrate in the US.

Beside the economic plans, Stephen A. Hurlbut, Christiancy&#x27;s successor, had negotiated with García Calderón the cession to the US of a naval base in Chimbote and the railroads to the coal mines upcountry. When it became known that Blaine&#x27;s representative in Peru, Hurlbut, would personally profit from the settlement, it was clear he was complicating the peace process The American attempts reinforced Garcia Calderon&#x27;s refusal to discuss the matter of territorial cession. Blaine then dispatched William H. Trescot in a mission to Chile to establish that problems would be resolved through arbitration and that acts of war would not justify territorial seizures. After the assassination of Garfield (2 July 1881) and the accession of Chester A. Arthur to the US presidency, Blaine was replaced by Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen as Secretary of State. Frelinghuysen thought that the US was in no position to back Blaine&#x27;s policy and recalled the Trescot mission.
Kenneth D. Lehmann commented the US policy: 
:&quot;Washington had interjected itself into the middle of the controversy without developing a realistic position: the moralizing of the United States had an air of hypocrisy in light of his own history, and veiled threats carried no weight.&quot;

Regarding a British intervention in the war, the British historian Victor Kiernan had stated: &quot;It should be emphasized that the Foreign Office never at any time contemplated any kind of active intervention... It was especially scrupulous in seeing to it that no warships were smuggled out for sale to either side, for it was in mortal dread of another Alabama Award.&quot; During the war, the British government embargoed four warships sold to Chile and Perú.

== Looting, damages, and war reparations ==
The case of looting and war reparations done by Chilean occupation forces in Peru has caused controversy between historians. It is overlooked in Chile and a source of anti-Chilean sentiment in Peru. The Chilean historian Milton Godoy Orellana distinguishes the looting after the battle of Chorrillos y Miraflores; the looting by Peruvians in Lima before the Chilean troops entered the city; and the Chilean destruction of locomotives, rails, printing machines, weapons, etc. The Chilean government tried to control it through the &quot;Oficina Recaudadora de las Contribuciones de Guerra,&quot; whose tasks were to inventory and realize the confiscation and to record and to confirm transport to Chile, the destination, and the sender. Allegedly, the strategic purposes were to obtain the peace. There is no general list of the looted goods, but many of the shipments were registered in private and official letters, newspaper articles, manifests, etc. Also, looting of cultural assets of Peru by the Chileans and Peruvians occurred; the development of international law regarding the protection of cultural objects evolved over the 19th and 20th centuries, but the idea of protecting cultural assets first emerged in Europe in the 18th century.

The Lieber Code of 1863 unconditionally protected works of art during an armed conflict (Art. 35) but expressly consented to the use of cultural property as war reparations (Art. 36). In fact, Sergio Villalobos states that in 1817, the US accepted the confiscation of art works but the 1874 Project of an International Declaration concerning the Laws and Customs of War asserted that the cultural assets were to be considered as protected.

In March 1881, the Chilean government began to seize the Biblioteca Nacional del Perú, and 45,000 books were seized, but some of the books were sold in Lima by Peruvians, and so it is contested how much of the booty was taken by the Chilean forces. In any case, in late March 1881, some of the books arrived to Chile, and the press began to inform and discuss about the legitimacy of looting oil paintings, books, statues, etc., or &quot;international robbery&quot;, as a journalist of &quot;La Epoca&quot; described it.

On 4 January 1883, in a session of the Chilean Congress, the deputy Augusto Matte Pérez questioned Minister of the Interior José Manuel Balmaceda on the &quot;opprobrious and humiliating&quot; shipments of Peruvian cultural assets. Montt asked the devolution of the assets and was supported by deputies McClure and Puelma. The minister vowed to impede further exactions and to repatriate the objects mentioned in the discussion. Apparently, he did so since the shipments stopped, and the mentioned statues are not there anymore, but it was not until November 2007 that Chile returned 3,778 stolen books to the Biblioteca Nacional del Perú. S. Villalobos asserted, &quot;There was no justification for the theft.&quot;
Another issue was the damage from acts of war on properties owned by citizens of neutral countries. In 1884, the &quot;Tribunales Arbitrales&quot; were constituted with a Chilean judge, who was named by the country of the claimant, as well as a Brazilian judge to deal with the claims of citizens from Britain (118 claims), Italy (440 claims), and France (89 claims). A tribunal was established in 1886 for German citizens. The &quot;Italian&quot; tribunal also dealt with Belgian citizens, and the &quot;German&quot; tribunal acted for Austrian and Swiss citizens. Spaniards accepted the decision of the Chilean state without the tribunal&#x27;s assistance and the US did not agree at the time.

According to international law, &quot;animus manendi&quot; claims by foreign citizens could not be made unless the damaged property had been in an actual battleground (such as Arica, Chorrillos, and Miraflores, with Pisagua and Tacna being in a similar situation), but damages caused by individual or scattered soldiers were dismissed. Only 3.6% (1,080,562 Chilean pesos) of the value that was claimed was recognized by the tribunals. According to Villalobos, the verdicts proved that the accusations against the Chilean forces had been exaggerated by Peruvians because of their wounded pride and by foreign citizens because of monetary interests.

== Consequences ==

The war had a profound and longlasting effect on the societies of all countries involved. The negotiations concerning territorial cessions continued until 1929, but the war ended in 1884 for all practical purposes. Various authors have referred to the war as a trauma for Peru and Bolivia.

Ever since the war ended, the aspiration to regain coastal sovereignty has been a recurring theme in Bolivia&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy, as well as a common cause of tensions with Chile. Even in the current century there have been periods when diplomatic relations break off and demands are placed in international courts. Bolivia included in its 2009 Constitution an inalienable right to the currently Chilean territories. However, these allegations against the existing treaties have not been supported by the International Court of Justice in the Bolivian demand against Chile before The Hague.

Relations between Chile and Peru after the Treaty of Lima have been more cordial than between Chile and Bolivia, although there have been diplomatic frictions. However, both nations maintain continuous diplomatic relations, cooperate in international trade, are part of the Pacific Alliance to promote mutual integration and joint strategic trade in Asia, and invest extensively in each other. This has generated rapid growth for both economies and a growing cultural exchange.

== Commemoration ==
Día del Mar is celebrated in Bolivia on 23 March, at the conclusion of the weeklong Semana del Mar with a ceremony at La Paz&#x27;s Plaza Abaroa, in homage to war hero Eduardo Abaroa, and in parallel ceremonies nationwide.

Naval Glories Day is a Chilean anniversary that commemorates two naval battles that occurred on Wednesday, 21 May 1879: that of Iquique, where captain of frigate Arturo Prat died along with the entire crew of the corvette Esmeralda, sunk by the Peruvian monitor Huáscar (built in the United Kingdom for the Peruvian government in 1864, it served in the Peruvian Navy until it was captured by Chile in 1879) under the command of Captain Miguel Grau; and that of Punta Gruesa, where the schooner Covadonga, under the command of Carlos Condell, ran aground the Peruvian armored frigate Independencia, under the command of Juan Guillermo More, in the rocks of Punta Gruesa.

<text>Baron Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm (4 March 1574 – 17 March 1650) was a Swedish soldier and politician. He was made a baron (&quot;friherre&quot;) in 1615, appointed Field Marshal in 1616, Privy Councilor in 1617, Governor General of Ingria in 1617 and served as Lord High Admiral from 1620 until his death.
==Biography==
He was an illegitimate son of Duke Carl, later King Charles IX of Sweden, and Karin Nilsdotter, the daughter of a clergyman from Östergötland. He was raised at the royal estate of Julita Abbey (&quot;Julita gård&quot;) in Södermanland. He was thus the older half-brother of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. It was the tradition in Sweden in this period that noble children born out of wedlock were acknowledged by their fathers, as long as they were not the product of adultery. Carl Carlsson was ennobled in 1592 with the surname Gyllenhielm and entered the service of the crown as a soldier. He served with the navy in the 1590s before moving to the army during the Swedish-Polish War (1600-11).

He was captured by the enemy in Poland in 1601 and remained a prisoner of war for twelve years. After attempting to escape, he was forced to wear leg irons for the last six and a half years of his captivity. He was freed in 1613, and shortly after raised to the rank of baron and field marshal by his half-brother, the king. 
On 27 February 1617 the Treaty of Stolbovo ended the Ingrian War (1610–1617), fought between the Swedish Empire and Russia. From 1617, Gyllenhielm was the governor general of the province of Ingria, until he returned to Sweden in 1620 to become Lord High Admiral. Admirals in this period were expected to lead the navy at sea as well as administrate, but Gyllenhielm did not often take command himself. He delegated much of the day-to-day business of the navy to Clas Fleming, and focused his naval efforts on overseeing the navy&#x27;s finances. In September 1628, he served as the chairman of the tribunal convened to investigate the loss of the new warship &quot;Vasa&quot;.
After the death of Gustavus Adolphus in Germany during 1632, Gyllenhielm was responsible for returning his half-brother&#x27;s body to Sweden. In the following year, he was appointed to the regency government which ruled in the name of Queen Christina of Sweden during her minority, until 1644. He built Karlberg Palace to the northwest of Stockholm and spent his last years there. He died at Karlberg in 1650, and was buried at Strängnäs Cathedral. Karlberg was eventually taken over as an administrative headquarters for the Swedish military, but several of the central reception rooms are preserved as they were in Gyllenhielm&#x27;s lifetime.

<text>Count Gustav Horn (October 22, 1592 – May 10, 1657) was a Swedish nobleman of Finnish descent, military officer, and Governor-General. 
He was appointed member of the Royal Council in 1625, Field Marshal in 1628, Governor General of Livonia in 1652 and Lord High Constable since 1653. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), he was instrumental as a commander in securing victory at the Battle of Breitenfeld, in 1631. He was High Councillor of the realm in 1625, elevated to the rank of field marshal in 1628, and sometimes commander-in-chief of Swedish forces in Germany during Thirty Years&#x27; War. After the war, he served as Governor-General of Livonia 1652, President of War department and Lord High Constable in 1653. In 1651, Queen Christina created him Count of Björneborg (&quot;Horn af Björneborg&quot;).

==Biography==
===Background===
Gustav Horn was born on October 22, 1592 at Örbyhus in Uppsala County, Sweden. He was the youngest son of Field Marshal and Agneta von Dellwig. He was born while his father was imprisoned in Örbyhus Castle at Tierp. He was born into the Swedish (geographically and ethnically Finnish) noble family Horn af Kankas and was educated extensively in European universities. He studied military sciences under prince Maurice of Orange in the Netherlands. He participated in the Ingrian War against Russia under the leadership of Evert Horn for two years. As a colonel, Gustav Horn took part in the siege of Riga in 1621 and was seriously wounded. He led troops which conquered Dorpat in Livonian Estonia. With Count Jakob De la Gardie, he led the defense of Livonia against Poland in the late 1620s. At age 35, he was elevated to the rank of Field Marshal by King Gustav II Adolf.
 He also led troops in the Battle of Wallhof and the Batte of Wenden in 1626.

===Command of Swedish forces===

When King Gustav II Adolf decided to join the war in Germany (1630), he appointed Gustav Horn as his second in command. At the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631, Horn prevented the Imperial force under Tilly from flanking the main body of the Swedish army, after their Saxon allies had fled the field. After this Horn led troops in Upper (southern) Franconia and conquered among others, Mergentheim, the town of the Teutonic Order and the bishopric of Bamberg). He then went to Bavaria with the king. Horn was sent to lead troops in the Rhineland, where he occupied Koblenz and Trier, and continued to Swabia.

After the death of King Gustav II Adolf at Lützen in November 1632, Field Marshal Horn and General John Banér were appointed to the overall command of Swedish forces in Germany. Gustav Horn&#x27;s father-in-law, the Chancellor Oxenstierna, took the leadership of the civil government.
When Horn was ordered to combine his troops with those of Bernhard of Weimar, the two men found themselves unable to work together, and they were given separate commands.

After Wallenstein&#x27;s murder in 1634, Horn took some areas in Swabia: in the spring of that year, his troops unsuccessfully laid siege to the imperial city of Überlingen, which would have been a rich and valuable prize. In early September 1634 his forces, and those of Bernard of Saxony, were crushed at the Battle of Nördlingen by combined Habsburg and Spanish forces. Horn was taken prisoner and held by the Roman Catholic army in Burghausen Castle until 1642. He was exchanged for three imperial generals.

===Later career===

Following his exchange, Horn was appointed Vice President of the War Department. During the war against Denmark-Norway in 1644, Horn led the attack on Skåne and conquered the whole province, except the towns of Malmö and Kristianstad. Malmö&#x27;s siege lasted until the Treaty of Brömsebro brought the war to an end. 
In 1651, Horn received Pori (&quot;Björneborg&quot;) on the west coast of Finland. His estate at Alūksne in Livonia (&quot;Marienborg&quot;) was made into a barony. Horn then served as Governor-General in Livonia, and as Lord High Constable of the empire, becoming Lord President of the War Department.
When the war against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth broke out in 1655, Gustav Horn directed the defense of Sweden against possible Polish invasion.
Gustav Horn was one of the most capable of Gustav II Adolf&#x27;s military commanders, and also an able administrator. His particular skills were in arranging defenses for several sorts of situations. He also maintained relatively strict discipline, so his troops did not plunder and pillage as much as others.

== Häringe Manor==
Gustav Horn acquired Häringe Manor (&quot;Häringe slott&quot;) at Västerhaninge parish in Södermanland during 1625. The estate was received as a gift from King Gustav II Adolf. The main building was built on the initiative of Gustav Horn and was completed in 1657. After the death of Gustav Horn on May 10, 1657, the estate was inherited by his daughter Agneta Horn (1629–1672), by her daughter Hedvig Catharina Lillie (1695–1745) in 1730 and then by Carl Julius De la Gardie (1729–1786) in 1745.
==Family==
In 1628 Horn married first to Kristina Oxenstierna (1609–1631), daughter of Count and Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna. They had two children:
#Agneta Horn (1629–1672) who married baron Lars Cruus of Gudhem, Lord of Harviala.

#Axel Horn (1630–1631).

In 1643 Horn married Sigrid Bielke (1620–1679). They had nine children:
#Anna Katarina Horn (born and died 1644)
#Kristina Horn (born and died 1646)
#Ebba Sigrid Horn (born and died 1646), twin with Kristina
#Helena Horn (1647–1648)
#Maria Eleonora Horn (1648–1652)
#Gustav Karl Horn (1650–1654)
#Evert Horn (1652–1654)
#Eva Horn (1653–1740), married Nils Bielke.
#Hedvig Lovisa Horn (1655–17??), married firstly Ture Karlsson Sparre and secondly Bernhard von Liewen.

<text>was the 11th &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Ashikaga shogunate who reigned from 1494 to 1508 during the Muromachi period of Japan. He was the son of Ashikaga Masatomo and grandson of the sixth &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshinori. His childhood name was Seikō (清晃), Yoshizumi was first called Yoshitō (sometimes translated as Yoshimichi), then Yoshitaka.

Yoshizumi was adopted by the 8th &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimasa. He was installed by Hosokawa Masamoto as &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot;. He was stripped of the title in 1508 by the 10th &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshitane, who became &quot;shōgun&quot; for a second period of time.

Two of Yoshizumi&#x27;s sons would themselves become &quot;shōguns&quot;. Ashikaga Yoshiharu would hold nominal powers as the twelfth Muromachi &quot;shōgun&quot;; and Ashikaga Yoshihide assumed nominal powers as the fourteenth &quot;shōgun&quot;.

==Family==
* Father: Ashikaga Masatomo (1435–1491)
* Mother: daughter of Mushanakoji Takamitsu
* Adopted Father: Ashikaga Yoshimasa
* Adopted Mother: Hino Tomiko
* Wife: Hino Akiko
* Concubine: speculated daughter of Shiba Yoshihiro or daughter of Rokkaku Takayori
* Children:
** Ashikaga Yoshiharu by Akiko
** Ashikaga Yoshitsuna by daughter of Shiba or Rokkaku

==Events of Yoshizumi&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
Significant events shape the period during which Yoshizumi was &quot;shōgun&quot;:
* 1494 – Hosokawa Masamoto has Yoshizumi appointed &quot;shōgun&quot;.
* 1495 – Hōjō Sōun captures Odawara.
* 1500 – Go-Kashiwabara succeeds.

==Eras of Yoshizumi&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
The years in which Yoshizumi was shogun are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Meiō&quot; (1492–1501)

<doc id="234185" wikidata="Q1778968" url="?curid=234185" title="Compartment syndrome">
<text>Compartment syndrome is a serious condition. Increased pressure in a body compartment can harm blood flow and tissue function. If not treated quickly, it may cause permanent damage. There are two types, acute and chronic. Acute compartment syndrome can lead to a loss of the affected limb due to tissue death.

Symptoms of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) include severe pain, decreased blood flow, decreased movement, numbness, and a pale limb. It is most often due to physical trauma, like a bone fracture (up to 75% of cases) or a crush injury. It can also occur after blood flow returns following a period of poor circulation. Diagnosis is clinical, based on symptoms, not a specific test. However, it may be supported by measuring the pressure inside the compartment. It is classically described by pain out of proportion to the injury, or pain with passive stretching of the muscles. Normal compartment pressure should be 12-18 mmHg; higher is abnormal and needs treatment. Treatment is urgent surgery to open the compartment. If not treated within six hours, it can cause permanent muscle or nerve damage.
Chronic compartment syndrome (CCS), or chronic exertional compartment syndrome, causes pain with exercise. The pain fades after activity stops. Other symptoms may include numbness. Symptoms usually resolve with rest. Running and biking commonly trigger CCS. This condition generally does not cause permanent damage. Similar conditions include stress fractures and tendinitis. Treatment may include physical therapy or, if that fails, surgery.

ACS is an emergency, and outcome largely depends on the time to diagnosis and treatment. If treated within 3 hours, the prognosis is favorable. Complications and permanent damage can occur.
ACS occurs in about 1-10% of those with a tibial shaft fracture. It is more common in males and those under 35, due to trauma. German surgeon Richard von Volkmann first described compartment syndrome in 1881. Delayed treatment can cause pain, nerve damage, cosmetic changes, and Volkmann&#x27;s contracture.

==Signs and symptoms==
Compartment syndrome usually presents within a few hours of an inciting event, but it may present anytime up to 48 hours after. The earliest symptom is a tense, &quot;wood-like&quot; feeling in the affected limb. There may also be decreased pulses, paralysis, and pallor, along with paresthesia. Usually, NSAIDs cannot relieve the pain. High compartment pressure may limit the range of motion In acute compartment syndrome, the pain will not be relieved with rest. In chronic exertional compartment syndrome the pain will dissipate with rest.

===Acute ===

There are five signs and symptoms of acute compartment syndrome. They are known as the &quot;5 Ps&quot;: pain, pallor, decreased pulse, paresthesia, and paralysis. Pain and paresthesia are the early symptoms of compartment syndrome.

Common symptoms are:
* Pain: A person may feel pain greater than the exam findings. This pain may not be relieved by strong painkillers, including opioids like morphine. It may be due to nerve damage from ischemia. A person may experience pain disproportionate to the findings of the physical examination. The pain is aggravated by passively stretching the muscle group within the compartment. However, such pain may disappear in the late stages of the compartment syndrome. 
* Paresthesia (altered sensation): A person may complain of &quot;pins and needles,&quot; numbness, and a tingling sensation. This may progress to loss of sensation (anesthesia) if no intervention is made.

Uncommon symptoms are: 
* Paralysis: Paralysis of the limb is a rare, late finding. It may indicate both a nerve or muscular lesion.
* Pallor: Pallor describes the loss of color to the affected limb. Other skin changes can include swelling, stiffness, or cold temperature. 
* Pulselessness: A lack of pulse rarely occurs in patients, as pressures that cause compartment syndrome are often lower than arterial pressures. Absent pulses occur only with arterial injury or late-stage compartment syndrome, when pressures are very high.

===Chronic===
Chronic exertional compartment syndrome, CECS, may cause pain, tightness, cramps, weakness, and numbness. This pain can last for months or even years, but rest may relieve it. There may also be mild weakness in the affected area.

Exercise causes these symptoms. They start with muscle tightness, then a painful burning if exercise continues. After exercise stops, the compartment pressure will drop in a few minutes. This will relieve the pain. Symptoms will occur after a certain level of exercise. This threshold can range anywhere from 30 seconds of running to 2–3 miles of running. CECS most often occurs in the lower leg. The anterior compartment is most affected. Foot drop is a common symptom.

==Causes==

===Acute===
Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a medical emergency. It can develop after traumatic injuries, like car accidents, gunshot wounds, fractures, or intense sports. Examples include a severe crush injury or an open or closed fracture of an extremity. Rarely, ACS can develop after a minor injury or another medical issue. It can also affect the thigh, buttock, hand, abdomen, and foot. The most common cause of acute compartment syndrome is a fractured bone, usually the tibia. Leg compartment syndrome occurs in 1% to 10% of tibial fractures. It is strongly linked to tibial diaphysis fractures and other tibial injuries. Direct injury to blood vessels can reduce blood flow to soft tissues, causing compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome can also be caused by:

* intravenous drug injection
* casts
* prolonged limb compression
* crush injuries
* anabolic steroid use
* vigorous exercise
* eschar from burns

Patients on anticoagulant therapy, or those with blood disorders such as hemophilia or leukemia are at higher risk of developing compartment syndrome.

Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the intra-abdominal pressure exceeds 20 mmHg and abdominal perfusion pressure is less than 60 mmHg. There are many causes, which can be broadly grouped into three mechanisms: primary (internal bleeding and swelling); secondary (vigorous fluid replacement as an unintended complication of resuscitative medical treatment, leading to the acute formation of ascites and a rise in intra-abdominal pressure); and recurrent (compartment syndrome that has returned after the initial treatment of secondary compartment syndrome).

Compartment syndrome after snake bite is rare. Its incidence varies from 0.2 to 1.36% as recorded in case reports. Compartment syndrome after a snake bite is more common in children. Increased white blood cell count of more than 1,650/μL and aspartate transaminase (AST) level of more than 33.5 U/L are associated with developing compartment syndrome. Otherwise, those bitten by venomous snakes should be observed for 48 hours to exclude the possibility of compartment syndrome.

Acute compartment syndrome due to severe/uncontrolled hypothyroidism is rare.

===Chronic===
When repeated use of the muscles causes compartment syndrome, it is chronic compartment syndrome (CCS). This is usually not an emergency, but loss of circulation can damage nearby nerves and muscles. The damage may be temporary or permanent.

A subset of chronic compartment syndrome is chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS), often called exercise-induced compartment syndrome (EICS). CECS is often a diagnosis of exclusion. CECS of the leg is caused by exercise. This condition occurs commonly in the lower leg and various other locations within the body, such as the foot or forearm. CECS can be seen in athletes who train rigorously in activities that involve constant repetitive actions or motions.

==Pathophysiology==
ACS is defined as a critical pressure increase within a confined compartmental space causing a decline in the perfusion pressure to the tissue within that compartment . A normal human body needs a pressure gradient for blood flow. It must go from the higher-pressure arterial system to the lower-pressure venous system. This causes blood to back up. Excess fluid leaks from the capillaries into the spaces between the soft tissue&#x27;s cells. This swells the extracellular space and raises the pressure in the compartment. The swelling of the soft tissues around the blood vessels compresses the blood and lymphatic vessels. This causes more fluid to enter the extracellular spaces, leading to further compression. The pressure keeps rising due to the non-compliant fascia in the compartment. This cycle can cause tissue ischemia, a lack of oxygen, and necrosis, or tissue death. Paresthesia, or tingling, can start as early as 30 minutes after tissue ischemia begins. Permanent damage can occur 12 hours after the injury starts.

The reduced blood supply can trigger inflammation. This can cause the soft tissues to swell. Reperfusion therapy can worsen this inflammation. The fascia that defines the limbs&#x27; compartments does not stretch. Even a small bleed or muscle swelling can greatly raise the pressure.

The pathophysiology of CECS is not entirely understood. In CECS, pressure in an anatomical compartment increases due to a 20% increase in muscle volume. This builds pressure in the tissues and muscles, causing ischemia. Increased muscle weight reduces the compartment volume of the surrounding fascial borders, raising compartment pressure. An increase in the pressure of the tissue can force fluid to leak into the interstitial space (extracellular fluid), leading to a disruption of the micro-circulation of the leg.

==Diagnosis==

Compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. It comes from a provider&#x27;s exam and the patient&#x27;s history. Diagnosis may also require measuring intracompartmental pressure. Using both methods increases the accuracy of diagnosing compartment syndrome. A transducer connected to a catheter is inserted 5 cm into the zone of injury to measure the intracompartmental pressure. Normal pressure is 10 mmHg. Anything greater can compromise circulation, and 30 mmHg has been commonly cited as the upper threshold before circulation is lost.

Noninvasive methods, like near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), show promise in controlled settings. NIRS uses sensors on the skin. However, with limited data, the gold standard for diagnosis is the clinical presentation and intracompartmental pressure.

Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is often diagnosed by ruling out other conditions. The key sign is that there are no symptoms when at rest. The best test is to measure intracompartmental pressures after running, when symptoms return. Tests like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs help rule out other problems. But they don&#x27;t confirm compartment syndrome/ However, MRI is effective for diagnosing chronic exertional compartment syndrome.

==Treatment==

===Acute===

Remove any external compression on the affected limb. This includes tourniquets, orthopedic casts, or dressings. Cutting the cast will reduce the intracompartmental pressure by 65%. It will drop by 10 to 20% after cutting the padding. After removal of the external compression the limb should be placed at the level of the heart. The vital signs of the patient should be closely monitored. If the condition does not improve, a fasciotomy is needed to decompress the compartments. An incision large enough to decompress all the compartments is necessary. This surgery is done in an operating theater under anesthesia. There is debate over when to close the fasciotomy wound. Some surgeons recommend closing wounds seven days after fasciotomy. There are several methods to do this, like vacuum-assisted and shoelace techniques. The vacuum-assisted one has led to longer hospital stays . A skin graft may be needed to close the wound. This would complicate treatment and require a much longer hospital stay.

Fasciotomy is often overused for compartment syndrome from snake bites. It may worsen prognosis. Treat this compartment syndrome with antivenom. Unlike other causes, fasciotomy is rarely needed. If pressure stays high after antivenom, give more. Measure compartment pressure before and after giving antivenom. Only patients who do not respond to more antivenom should get a fasciotomy.

===Chronic===
Chronic exertional compartment syndrome can be treated by:
* Reducing or stopping exercise and other activities
* Massage
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication
* Physiotherapy

Chronic compartment syndrome in the lower leg can be treated conservatively or surgically. Avoid using devices that apply pressure, like splints, casts, or tight dressings. If symptoms persist after basic treatment, or if someone wants to keep doing painful activities, compartment syndrome can be treated with surgery called fasciotomy.

A 2012 US military study found that forefoot running reduced symptoms of anterior compartment syndrome. The study focused on runners with chronic exertional compartment syndrome in their lower legs. They reported that running with a forefoot strike limits use of the tibialis anterior muscle which may explain the relief in symptoms in those with anterior compartment syndrome.

Case reports suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help with crush injury, compartment syndrome, and other acute ischemias. It may improve wound healing and reduce the need for repeated operations.

==Prognosis==
Researchers have reported a mortality rate of 47% for acute compartment syndrome of the thigh. A study showed the fasciotomy rate for acute compartment syndrome ranges from 2% to 24%. The key factor in acute compartment syndrome is the time to diagnosis and fasciotomy. A missed or late diagnosis may require limb amputation to survive. After a fasciotomy, some symptoms may be permanent. It depends on which compartment was affected, the time until surgery, and muscle necrosis. Muscle necrosis can happen fast, sometimes within just 3 hours after an injury. A fasciotomy in the leg&#x27;s lateral compartment might cause symptoms affecting nearby nerves and muscles. These may include foot drop, numbness along leg, numbness of big toe, pain, and loss of foot eversion.

=== Complications ===
If pressure is not relieved, tissues may die (necrosis) in the affected compartment. Blood will be unable to enter the smallest vessels. Capillary perfusion pressure will fall. This, in turn, leads to a gradual lack of oxygen in the tissues that depend on this blood supply. Without enough oxygen, the tissue will die. On a large scale, this can cause Volkmann&#x27;s contracture in the affected limbs. It is permanent and irreversible. Other complications include neurological deficits, gangrene, and chronic regional pain syndrome. Rhabdomyolysis and kidney failure are also possible. Some case series report rhabdomyolysis in 23% of patients with ACS.

==Epidemiology==
In a case series of 164 people with acute compartment syndrome, 69% had an associated fracture. The article&#x27;s authors found that the yearly rate of acute compartment syndrome is 1 to 7.3 cases per 100,000 people. It varies greatly by age and gender in trauma. Men are ten times more likely than women to get ACS. The mean age for ACS is 30 in men and 44 in women. People under 35 may get ACS more often. This is likely because they have more muscle mass. The anterior compartment of the leg is where ACS usually happens.

== Special Population ==
Children with Compartment Syndrome

The pathophysiology of acute compartment syndrome in children is the same as adults. However, cases are complicated by challenges in examination and communication with pediatric patients. Children may not be able to effectively report their pain symptoms. In addition, it can take longer to develop high pressures in pediatric compartments. Besides the &quot;5 Ps,&quot; the &quot;3 As&quot; can diagnose compartment syndrome in children: increasing anxiety, agitation, and analgesic needs. Normal compartment pressures in children are typically higher than adults. The most common cause of compartment syndrome in children is traumatic injury. In children &lt;10 years of age, the cause is usually vascular injury or infection. In children &gt;14 years of age, the cause is usually due to trauma or surgical positioning. Treatment for compartment syndrome in children is the same as adults.

<text>Individual branding, also called individual product branding, flanker brands or multibranding, is &quot;a branding strategy in which products are given brand names that are newly created and generally not connected to names of existing brands offered by the company.&quot; Each brand, even within a same company, has a unique name, identity and image, allowing the company to target different market segments, tailor pricing and marketing strategies, and separate the image and reputation of different products.

Individual branding contrasts with umbrella branding and corporate branding, in which the firm markets all of its product together, using the same brand name and identity.

== Applicability ==

Individual branding is the most effective when a company offers numerous unconnected commodities, which vary in quality and price and target different market segments. It is also useful when introducing a new, high-risk product to the market, in order to manage risks to existing brands if the new product should fail. However, the expected revenue from a new brand must justify the higher costs of marketing and advertising.

== Advantages ==

* Reduced corporate identity attached to a product allows brands to be positioned differently, so that product brand isn&#x27;t connected with the company brand;
* Each brand can use different marketing strategies;
* Brand separation allows a wider variety of products of different quality to be offered: lower-quality products under their own brand will not weaken the image of higher-quality products;
* Each brand can serve consumers in a different way, i.e. brands can work on different markets or appeal to different consumers aims, wishes and so-called &#x27;pains&#x27;;
* The company&#x27;s global reputation is not tied to products: the failure of one product will not affect the company&#x27;s global reputation.

== Disadvantages ==

* Instability within a company can occur because of competition between its brands;
* Multiple brands may divide the market and split efforts within one company;
* Risk of undesired market cannibalism;
* Brand creation incurs a high cost in marketing, advertising and sales promotion;
* Launching new products as their own brand is higher risk: new brands lack acknowledgement and customer loyalty and need to find recognition.

== Examples ==

=== Procter &amp; Gamble ===
The American-based Procter &amp; Gamble is the world&#x27;s second largest FMCG company (2019). They have a portfolio of 65 brand overall, mostly in the domain of personal and household care. Examples of their brands include:

The company has the portfolio of the following categories:
* Beauty &amp; grooming: Always, Gilette, Head &amp; Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Lacoste fragrances, Max Factor, Old Spice, Oral-B, Pantene, Tampax 
* Household care: Ace, Ambi Pur, Ariel, Lenor, Fairy Liquid, Pampers

In 2014, 21 brands had annual sales of $1 billion to about $10 billion, and 11 with sales of $500 million to $1 billion. The global annual sales of the company was $83 billion in 2014.

=== Unilever ===
The British-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever operates in 190 countries worldwide. The company has a portfolio that includes the following categories and brands:
* Food and drink: Flora, Algida, Hellmann&#x27;s, Knorr, Lipton, Magnum, Ben&amp;Jerry&#x27;s, Carte D&#x27;or, Cornetto, Cremissimo, I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Butter, Rama, Bertolli 
* Home care: Domestos, Surf, Cajoline, Cif, Persil, Comfort 
* Personal care: Axe, Dove, Lux, Rexona, Signal, 
* Water purifier: Pureit

Of the company&#x27;s 400 brands, 14 have a yearly profit of over €1 billion, while the global yearly turnover of the company was €48.4 billion in 2014.

<doc id="234194" wikidata="Q1061357" url="?curid=234194" title="Positioning (marketing)">
<text>Positioning refers to the place that a brand occupies in the minds of the customers and how it is distinguished from the products of the competitors. It is different from the concept of brand awareness. In order to position products or brands, companies may emphasize the distinguishing features of their brand (what it is, what it does and how, etc.) or they may try to create a suitable image (inexpensive or premium, utilitarian or luxurious, entry-level or high-end, etc.) through the marketing mix. Once a brand has achieved a strong position, it can become difficult to reposition it. To effectively position a brand and create a lasting brand memory, brands need to be able to connect to consumers in an authentic way, creating a brand persona usually helps build this sort of connection.

Positioning is one of the most powerful marketing concepts. Originally, positioning focused on the product and with Al Ries and Jack Trout grew to include building a product&#x27;s reputation and ranking among competitor&#x27;s products. Schaefer and Kuehlwein extend the concept beyond material and rational aspects to include &#x27;meaning&#x27; carried by a brand&#x27;s mission or myth. Primarily, positioning is about &quot;the place a brand occupies in the mind of its target audience&quot;. Positioning is now a regular marketing activity or strategy. A national positioning strategy can often be used, or modified slightly, as a tool to accommodate entering into foreign markets.

The origins of the positioning concept are unclear. Scholars suggest that it may have emerged from the burgeoning advertising industry in the period following World War I, only to be codified and popularized in the 1950s and 60s. The positioning concept became very influential and continues to evolve in ways that ensure it remains current and relevant to practising marketers.

==Definitions==

David Ogilvy noted that while there was no real consensus as to the meaning of positioning among marketing experts, his definition is &quot;what a product does, and who it is for&quot;. For instance, Dove has been successfully positioned as a bar of soap for women with dry hands, vs. a product for men with dirty hands.

Al Ries and Jack Trout advanced several definitions of positioning. In an article, &quot;Industrial Marketing&quot;, published in 1969, Jack Trout stated that positioning is a mental device used by consumers to simplify information inputs and store new information in a logical place. He said this is important because the typical consumer is overwhelmed with unwanted advertising, and has a natural tendency to discard all information that does not immediately find a comfortable (and empty) slot in their mind. In &quot;Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind&quot;, the duo expanded the definition as &quot;an organized system for finding a window in the mind. It is based on the concept that communication can only take place at the right time and under the right circumstances&quot;.

Positioning is closely related to the concept of perceived value. In marketing, value is defined as the difference between a prospective customer&#x27;s evaluation of the benefits and costs of one product when compared with others. Value can be expressed in numerous forms including product benefits, features, style, value for money.

==Origins==
The precise origins of the positioning concept are unclear. Cano (2003), Schwartzkopf (2008), and others have argued that the concepts of market segmentation and positioning were central to the tacit knowledge that informed brand advertising from the 1920s, but did not become codified in marketing textbooks and journal articles until the 1950s and 60s.

Al Ries and Jack Trout are often credited with developing the concept of product or brand positioning in the late-1960s with the publication of a series of articles, followed by a book. Ries and Trout, both former advertising executives, published articles about positioning in &quot;Industrial Marketing&quot; in 1969 and &quot;Advertising Age&quot; in 1972. By the early 1970s, positioning became a popular word with marketers, especially those in advertising and promotion. In 1981, Ries and Trout published their now-classic book, &quot;Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind&quot;. However, the claim that Ries and Trout devised the concept has been challenged by marketing scholars. According to Stephen A. Fox, Al Ries, and Jack Trout &quot;resurrected the concept and made it their trademark.&quot;

Some scholars credit advertising guru, David Ogilvy, with developing the positioning concept in the mid-1950s, at least a decade before Ries and Trout published their now-classic series of articles. In their early writing, Ries and Trout suggest that the positioning concept was widely used in the advertising industry before the 1950s. Ogilvy&#x27;s writings indicate that he was well aware of the concept and drilled his creative team with this idea from at least the 1950s. Among other things, Ogilvy wrote that &quot;the most important decision is how to position your product&quot;, and &quot;Every advertisement is part of the long-term investment in the personality of the brand.&quot; Ogilvy is on record as having used the positioning concept in several campaigns in the mid-1950s and early 1960s, well before Ries and Trout published their articles on the positioning. In relation to a Dove campaign launched in 1957, Ogilvy explained, &quot;I could have positioned Dove as a detergent bar for men with dirty hands, but chose instead to position it as a toilet bar for women with dry skin. This is still working 25 years later.&quot; In relation to a SAAB campaign launched in 1961, Ogilvy later recalled that &quot;In Norway, the SAAB car had no measurable profile. We positioned it as a car for winter. Three years later it was voted the best car for Norwegian winters.&quot;

Yet other scholars have suggested that the positioning concept may have much earlier heritage, attributing the concept to the work of advertising agencies in both the US and the UK in the first decades of the twentieth century. Cano, for example, has argued that marketing practitioners followed competitor-based approaches to both market segmentation and product positioning in the first decades of the twentieth century; long before these concepts were introduced into the marketing literature in the 1950s and 60s. From around 1920, American agency, J. Walter Thompson (JWT), began to focus on developing brand personality, brand image, and brand identity—concepts that are very closely related to positioning. Across the Atlantic, the English agency, W. S. Crawford&#x27;s Ltd, began to use the concept of &#x27;product personality&#x27; and the &#x27;advertising idea&#x27; arguing that in order to stimulate sales and create a &#x27;buying habit&#x27; advertising had to &#x27;build a definitive association of ideas round the goods&#x27;. For example, in 1915 JWT acquired the advertising account for Lux soap. The agency suggested that the traditional positioning as a product for woolen garments should be broadened so that consumers would see it as a soap for use on all fine fabrics in the household. To implement, Lux was repositioned with a more up-market posture and began a long association with expensive clothing and high fashion. Cano has argued that the positioning strategy JWT used for Lux exhibited an insightful understanding of the way that consumers mentally construct brand images. JWT recognized that advertising effectively manipulated socially shared symbols. In the case of Lux, the brand disconnected from images of household drudgery and connected with images of leisure and fashion.

As advertising executives in their early careers, both Ries and Trout were exposed to the positioning concept via their work. Ries and Trout codified the tacit knowledge that was available in the advertising industry; popularizing the positioning concept with the publication of their articles and books. Ries and Trout were influential in diffusing the concept of positioning from the advertising community through to the broader marketing community. Their articles were to become highly influential. By the early 1970s, positioning became a popular word with marketers, especially those that were working in the area of advertising and promotion. In 1981 Ries and Trout published their classic book, &quot;Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind&quot; (McGraw-Hill 1981). The concept enjoys ongoing currency among both advertisers and marketers as suggested by Maggard who notes that positioning provides planners with a valuable conceptual vehicle, which is effectively used to make various strategy techniques more meaningful and more productive.

Several large brands – Lipton, Kraft, and Tide – developed &quot;precisely worded&quot; positioning statements that guided how products would be packaged, promoted, and advertised in the 1950s and 1960s. The article, &quot;How Brands Were Born: A Brief History of Modern Marketing,&quot; states, &quot;This marked the start of almost 50 years of marketing where &#x27;winning&#x27; was determined by understanding the consumer better than competitors and getting the total &#x27;brand mix&#x27; right. This early positioning tactic was focused on the product itself – its &quot;form, package size, and price&quot;, according to Al Ries and Jack Trout

The positioning concept continues to evolve. Traditionally called product positioning, the concept was limited due to its focus on the product alone. In addition to the previous focus on the product, positioning now includes building a brand&#x27;s reputation and competitive standing. John P. Maggard notes that positioning provides planners with a valuable conceptual vehicle for the implementation of more meaningful and productive marketing strategies. Many branding practitioners make positioning a part of brand strategy and even label it as &quot;brand positioning&quot;. However, in the book &quot;Get to Aha! Discover Your Positioning DNA and Dominate Your Competition&quot;, Andy Cunningham proposes that branding is actually &quot;derived from positioning; it is the emotional expression of positioning. Branding is the yang to positioning&#x27;s yin, and when both pieces come together, you have a sense of the company&#x27;s identity as a whole&quot;.

==Developing the positioning statement==

Positioning is part of the broader marketing strategy which includes three basic decision levels, namely segmentation, targeting and positioning, sometimes known as the S-T-P approach:

:Segmentation: refers to the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers (known as segments)

:Targeting: refers to the selection of a segment or segments that will become the focus of special attention (known as &quot;target markets&quot;).

:Positioning: refers to an overall strategy that &quot;aims to make a brand occupy a distinct position, relative to competing brands, in the mind of the customer&quot;.

In general terms, there are three broad types of positioning: functional, symbolic, and experiential position. Functional positions resolve problems, provide benefits to customers, or get favorable perception by investors (stock profile) and lenders. Symbolic positions address self-image enhancement, ego identification, belongingness and social meaningfulness, and affective fulfillment. Experiential positions provide sensory and cognitive stimulation.

===Positioning statement===
Both theorists and practitioners argue that the positioning statement should be written in a format that includes an identification of the target market, the market need, the product name and category, the key benefit delivered and the basis of the product&#x27;s differentiation from any competing alternatives. A basic template for writing positioning statements is as follows: &quot;For (target customer) who (statement of the need or opportunity), the (product name) is a (product category) that (statement of key benefit – that is, compelling reason to buy). Unlike (primary competitive alternative), our product (statement of primary differentiation).&quot; An annotated example of how this positioning statement might be translated for a specific application appears in the text-box that follows.
Notes: &quot;Annotations, added in square brackets, were not in the original positioning statement, but are included here to show how the general format and elements of positioning statements described in the preceding discussion, have been applied to the specific example, which in this case is Volvo.&quot;

===Differentiation vs positioning===
Differentiation is closely related to the concept of positioning. Differentiation is how a company&#x27;s product is unique, by being the first, least expensive, or some other distinguishing factor. A product or brand may have many points of difference, but they may not all be meaningful or relevant to the target market. Positioning is something (a perception) that happens in the minds of the target market whereas differentiation is something that marketers do, whether through product design, pricing or promotional activity.

==Strategies==

To be successful in a particular market a product must occupy an &quot;explicit, distinct and proper place in the minds of all potential and existing consumers&quot;. It has to also be relative to other rival products with which the brand competes. This may require considerable research of customer perceptions and competitor activity in order to ensure that the points of difference are meaningful in the minds of customers. Perceptual mapping (discussed below) is often used for this type of research.

Visibility and recognition is what product positioning is all about as the positioning of a product is what the product represents for a buyer the business is targeting. As markets become increasingly competitive, buyers have more purchase choices, and the process of setting one brand apart from rival brands is critical success factor. It is vital that a product or service needs to have a clear identity and placement to the needs of the consumers targeted as they will not only purchase the product, but can warrant a larger margin for the company through increased added value.

A number of different positioning strategies have been cited in the marketing literature:

==Perceptual mapping==

To identify suitable positions that a company or brand might occupy in a given market, analysts often turn to techniques such as perceptual mapping or correspondence analysis. Perceptual maps are a diagrammatic representation of consumers&#x27; mental perceptions of the relative place various brands occupy within a category. Traditionally perceptual mapping selects two variables that are relevant to consumers (often, but not necessarily, price and quality) and then asks a sample of the market to explain where they would place various brands in terms of the two variables. Results are averaged across all respondents, and results are plotted on a graph to indicate how the &quot;average&quot; member of the population views the brand that make up a category and how each of the brands relates to other brands within the same category. While perceptual maps with two dimensions are common, multi-dimensional maps are also used. A key advantage of perceptual mapping is that it can identify gaps in the market which the firm may choose to &#x27;own.&#x27; 


===Algorithms used in positioning analysis===

The following statistical procedures have been found to be useful in carrying out positioning analysis:

* Cluster analysis including overlapping clustering 
* Correspondence analysis
* Conjoint analysis 
* Multidimensional scaling especially non-metric scaling (NMS)
* Multivariate analysis

==Repositioning==

The right positioning strategy at the right time can help a brand build a powerful image in the mind of consumer(s). From time to time, the current positioning strategy fails to resonate. This could be due to new market entrants, changed customer preferences, structural change within the target market (such as ageing, segment creep) or simply that customers have forgotten about a brand and its position. When this happens, the company may need to consider a number of options:

: * Strengthen current positioning: reinforce the concepts of features that led to customers adopting a favourable view in the first instance;
: * Establish a new position: look for suitable niches where customers are underserviced and occupy that space;
: * Reposition (or de-position): change the way customers think about the product or brand, usually through comparative advertising;

Repositioning involves a deliberate attempt to alter the way that consumers view a product or brand. Repositioning can be a high risk strategy, but sometimes there are few alternatives.

Fishbein and Rosenberg&#x27;s attitude models indicate that it is possible for a business to influence and change the positioning of the brand by manipulating various factors that will affect a consumer&#x27;s attitude. Research on persons&#x27; attitudes suggests that a brand&#x27;s position in a prospective consumer&#x27;s mind is likely to be determined by the &quot;combined total of a number of product characteristics such as the price, quality, durability, reliability, colour, and flavour&quot;. The consumer places important weights on each of these product characteristics and it can be possible by using things such as promotional efforts to realign the weights of price, quality, durability, reliability, colour and flavour of which can then help adjust the position of a brand in the mind of the prospective consumer. Companies engaging in repositioning can choose to downplay some points of difference and emphasize others.

===Repositioning a company===

In volatile markets, it can be necessary – even urgent – to reposition an entire company, rather than just a product line or brand. When Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley suddenly shifted from investment to commercial banks, for example, the expectations of investors, employees, clients and regulators all needed to shift, and each company needed to influence how these perceptions changed. Doing so involves repositioning the entire firm. This is especially true of small and medium-sized firms, many of which often lack strong brands for individual product lines. In a prolonged recession, business approaches that were effective during healthy economies often become ineffective and it becomes necessary to change a firm&#x27;s positioning. Upscale restaurants, for example, which previously flourished on expense account dinners and corporate events, may for the first time need to stress value as a sale tool.

Repositioning a company involves more than a marketing challenge. It involves making hard decisions about how a market is shifting and how a firm&#x27;s competitors will react. Often these decisions must be made without the benefit of sufficient information, simply because the definition of &quot;volatility&quot; is that change becomes difficult or impossible to predict.

<text>Elephant and Castle is an area of South London, England, in the London Borough of Southwark. The name also informally refers to much of Walworth and Newington, due to the proximity of the London Underground station of the same name. The name is derived from a local coaching inn.

The major traffic junctions here are connected by a short road called Elephant and Castle, the nascent part of the A3. Traffic runs to and from Kent along the A2 (New Kent Road and Old Kent Road), much of the south of England on the A3, to the West End via St George&#x27;s Road, and to the City of London via London Road and Newington Causeway at the northern junction. Newington Butts and Walworth Road adjoin the southern junction. It forms part of the London Inner Ring Road and the boundary of the London congestion charge zone.

The subterranean River Neckinger, which originates in Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, flows east under the area towards St Saviour&#x27;s Dock where it enters the Thames. The area was significantly remodelled in the 1960s as part of post-war reconstruction. A new wave of redevelopment began in the late 2000s with the demolition of the brutalist Heygate Estate. The various phases of the project are due to last until the late 2020s. The demolition of the shopping centre and The Coronet took place in 2021.

The Elephant has two linked London Underground stations, on the Northern and Bakerloo lines, and a National Rail station served by limited Southeastern services and Thameslink suburban loop line services to Mitcham, Sutton and Wimbledon, and services to Kentish Town and St. Albans to Orpington or Sevenoaks via Catford.

==Notable buildings and institutions==
Skipton House, home of Public Health England; a large part of the London South Bank University campus; the London College of Communication (part of UAL), home to the Stanley Kubrick Archive; the Ministry of Sound nightclub; the Imperial War Museum, which sits in Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park; the Michael Faraday Memorial; the Siobhan Davies Studios, an award-winning Victorian school conversion by Sarah Wigglesworth; West Square; the original Bakerloo Line depot; the Inner London Crown Court; the Revolving Doors Agency; the London School of Musical Theatre; the Baitul Aziz Islamic Cultural Centre, the Cinema Museum; and the Metropolitan Tabernacle. The Cuming Museum is nearby on Walworth Road. A K2 model phone box from 1927, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and located on the southern side of New Kent Road, which was moved a few metres and reinstalled at the entrance of Ash Avenue in 2021, is a Grade II listed structure since 1986.

== Name ==


The name &quot;Elephant and Castle&quot; is derived from the name of a pub/coaching inn located at this major crossroad. The earliest surviving record of this name in relation to this area appears in the Court Leet Book of the Manor of Walworth, which met at &quot;Elephant and Castle, Newington&quot; on 21 March 1765.

The inn was rebuilt in 1816 and again in 1898, and the present Elephant &amp; Castle pub, at the junction of New Kent Road and Newington Causeway, was part of 1960s comprehensive redevelopment.

Newington, which was the name of the village forming the basis to the neighbourhood before the inn&#x27;s name took over, is a common place name in England. London quickly expanded into the northern parts of the parish from 1750 to 1830. By the end of the 19th century ten daughter parishes had arisen in Newington including its secondary manor, Walworth. No notable upper, lower, or hill parts of the ancient parish nor compass points have been used, so to locate businesses and homes without reference to traditional saints divisions, many people popularised the informal name, of the notable public house. Other instances in Inner London are &#x27;Angel&#x27; at Islington and Bricklayers Arms at the east end of New Kent Road.

===The myths of the Infanta and the Cutlers&#x27; Company===
The popular and enduring idea that the inn itself derives its name from an English corruption of the phrase , as a reference to Eleanor of Castile, has been debunked by local historian Stephen Humphrey in his 2013 book &quot;Elephant and Castle, a History&quot;.

After examining how the image of an elephant with a castle on its back has been popular for centuries and throughout Europe (the earliest example predating Queen Eleanor by 1,500 years), and pointing out the fact that the sign only begins to be used in the area about 500 years after Eleanor was alive, he states:

The story of Queen Eleanor in relation to the Elephant and Castle is therefore a myth. It is wildly anachronistic both in respect of the sign in general and in its specific use in Newington, and she has no connection with the sign or with the place.

The author also refutes the claim that the pub name derives from the Cutlers&#x27; Company. First he notes:

 The sign was adopted by the Cutlers&#x27; Company of the City of London, because of the use of ivory in the handles of cutlery. The Royal African Company of 1672 likewise used the sign due to the ivory trade. 

Prior to the public house&#x27;s appearance in the records in 1765, John Flaxman had been allowed to build a workshop on the site around 1642. Stephen Humphrey describes him as a smith or farrier. Thirty years later another farrier is cited as lessee of the site, which is now known as the White Horse. The building is first described as a public house called the Elephant and Castle with a licensee called George Frost in 1765, although this may not have been the year of opening. The author adds:

 We can only say that the Elephant and Castle pub existed without doubt from 1765 and may have been founded under that name by George Frost as early as 1754. 

Stephen Humphrey explains that George Frost&#x27;s name appears in other manor and vestry records but he made no appearance in the records of the Farriers&#x27; Company and was not included among the apprentices of the Cutlers&#x27; Company. There is no evidence to connect him with the shoeing of horses, the cutlery trade or with another pub elsewhere before he arrived at Newington. The sudden appearance of the ancient sign under his proprietorship cannot be explained by his career. As with the vast majority of pub names, the choice in this case was probably a random one. 

== History ==

=== Medieval and early modern ===
Known previously as Newington (Newington Butts and Newington Causeway are two of the principal roads of the area), in the medieval period it was part of rural Surrey, in the manor of Walworth. This is listed in the Domesday Book as belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury; the income from its rents and tithes supplied the monks at Christ Church Canterbury with their clothing, and a &#x27;church&#x27; is mentioned. The parish was called St Mary, Newington, which church occupied the southwest side of today&#x27;s southern roundabout, near the Tabernacle, and was first recorded by name in 1222.

In May 1557, William Morant, Stephen Gratwick and a man named King, known as the Southwark Martyrs, were burnt at the stake in St George&#x27;s Field on the site of the present Tabernacle during the Marian Persecutions.

St Mary&#x27;s Church was rebuilt in 1720 and completely replaced in 1790, to a design of Francis Hurlbatt. Within another hundred years this too was to be demolished, with its replacement on Kennington Park Road ready in 1876. It was destroyed by bombing in 1940 during the Second World War. The remains of the tower and an arch were incorporated into its replacement of 1958. The open space is still known as St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, and the narrow pedestrian walk at its south end is Churchyard Row.

There is record of a &#x27;hospital&#x27; before the Reformation. In 1601 the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers erected St Peter&#x27;s Hospital on the site of the present London College of Communication. This expanded and survived until 1850, when it was removed to Wandsworth. The Drapers&#x27; livery company created Walters&#x27; Almshouses on a site now at the southern junction island in 1640, giving the tower block opposite the name Draper House. The almshouses were relocated to Brandon Street in the 1960s as part of the major redevelopment.

=== Rise to metropolitan prominence (1750–1900) ===
The neighbourhood became urbanised and somewhat commercial after the building of Westminster Bridge in 1751 and the improvements to London Bridge in the same period. These required &#x27;by-pass&#x27; roads across the south side approaches to each other and also to the main routes to the south and southeast coasts. These road improvements – Great Dover Street, Westminster Bridge, New Kent Road, St George&#x27;s Road and Borough Road – connect to the older Kennington and Old Kent Roads to facilitate this traffic. In 1769 the new Blackfriars Bridge was connected to this system at what is now St George&#x27;s Circus and Blackfriars Road (originally Great Surrey Road) and to the Elephant junction with the new London Road. As a result of these improvements, the area became a built-up part of the metropolis during the late Georgian and Victorian periods.

The railway arrived here in 1863 and the first deep-level tube line, now part of the Northern line&#x27;s City Branch, in 1890. The Bakerloo line terminus was created in 1906. The middle-class and working-class populations increased, the first settling on the major roads, the latter on the streets behind these. The area declined socio-economically in much of the Walworth (south-east) side as work in London Docklands shifted further east and became more mechanised, and the regional-level railway yard work decreased (see Bricklayers Arms railway station).

In the 19th century the nationally famed Baptist preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon built the Metropolitan Tabernacle here. The building, designed by William Willmer Pocock, was finished in 1861 and dedicated on 18 March. It was bombed in the bombing of London but the portico and basement survived. In 1957 the tabernacle was rebuilt to a new, much smaller design, accommodating surviving original features.

The Theatre Royal was built in 1872 and destroyed by fire only six years later. Renovations were initiated by Jethro Thomas Robinson after the fire, and completed by Frank Matcham, to what became the Elephant and Castle Theatre in 1879. The Theater was converted to an ABC cinema in 1928, and became The Coronet Cinema in 1981.

During the late 19th century there was a cemetery in the vicinity, but it was built over during London&#x27;s rapid expansion. A few gravestones remain in St. Mary&#x27;s Churchyard. At the north side of the churchyard, the church of St Gabriel&#x27;s Newington was built in 1874 before being demolished in 1937 on what is now a walkway called St Gabriel Walk.

== 20th century ==
=== Peak years: 1900–1939 ===
The area became the location for a thriving shopping area, known as &quot;the Piccadilly (Circus) of South London&quot;, with its own department store (William Tarn and Co) and many smaller outlets. Also featured were a shoe factory, a branch of Burton and a renowned hatter.

In 1930, the Trocadero, a monumental neo-Renaissance style picture house seating over 3000 and fitted with the largest Wurlitzer organ imported to the United Kingdom, was built at the northern corner of the New Kent Road (a plaque commemorating the building was unveiled in 2008 by Denis Norden, who had worked there in his youth). This was replaced in 1966 by a smaller cinema (the Odeon, known for a time after closure as an Odeon in 1982 as the Coronet, not to be confused with the Coronet below) which was demolished in 1988.

In 1932, another cinema opened across the street, The Coronet. From the early to mid 2000s until its eventual closure for impending demolition, The Coronet building was mostly used as a night-club and concert venue.

At the time it seated over 2000 people, and was an art-deco conversion of the Elephant and Castle theatre, opened in 1879 on the site of the short-lived Theatre Royal (built in 1872 and burnt down six years later). It was reconstructed in 1882 and again in 1902.

One monument to cinema still remains just off the Elephant, the Cinema Museum is a volunteer-run museum with screenings of classic cinema and a vast collection of cinema memorabilia. It is located in the old workhouse where Charlie Chaplin spent time as a child.

==== Second World War ====

The Elephant was the centre of the target zone for the German air raids on London on 10 May 1941 and suffered &quot;raging fires&quot;.

==== Post-war rebuilding (1945–2000) ====

The major development of the 1960s consisted of post-war reconstruction to a larger metropolitan plan, much of it replacing properties destroyed by bombing in World War II and creating two infamous roundabouts.

The Metropolitan Tabernacle was reconstructed behind its preserved classical facade to a smaller scale than the original. Alexander Fleming House (1959), originally a group of government office blocks and now Metro Central Heights residential complex, is a prime example of the work of the Hungarian modernist architect Ernő Goldfinger.

The shopping centre, designed by Boissevain &amp; Osmond for the Willets Group, was opened in March 1965. It was the first covered shopping mall in Europe, with 120 shops on three levels and a two-storey underground car-park. In the sales brochure (1963), Willets claimed it to be the &quot;largest and most ambitious shopping venture ever to be embarked upon in London. In design planning and vision it represents an entirely new approach to retailing, setting standards for the sixties that will revolutionise shopping concepts throughout Britain.&quot; When it opened, budget restrictions meant that the proportions and finishes of the building had had to be scaled down and only 29 out of a possible 120 shops were trading. The demolition of the shopping centre and The Coronet took place in 2021.

The Elephant is the location of the London College of Communication, formerly the London College of Printing, an internationally renowned dedicated college, part of University of the Arts London. The present structure was constructed during the redevelopment of the area in the early 1960s. It is slated for demolition in the mid 2020s, when the college is due to move to a new campus being built on the site of the Coronet Theatre.

In 1974 the Brutalist Heygate Estate, designed by Tim Tinker, was completed. It was home to more than 3,000 people. The estate was once a popular place to live, the flats being thought light and spacious, but the estate later developed a reputation for crime, poverty and dilapidation. It was demolished in the 2010s and replaced with the Elephant Park development, which, the developer claimed, includes &quot;the largest new green space to be created in London for 70 years.&quot;

Perronet House, an award-winning residential block owned by Southwark Council, was designed by Sir Roger Walters. It was completed in 1970 and extended in 1987.

At the south of the area stood Castle House (an office building now replaced by Strata SE1), which was part of the Draper Estaste. When Draper House, which still exists, was built in 1964, with its 25 floors, it was the tallest structure in London. The design was by Hubert Bennett of the London City Council&#x27;s (LCC&#x27;s) Architects Department and inspired by Le Corbusier. Well regarded at the time, the building was featured in Architecture Review which said it, &#x27;sets a standard of clarity and vigour&#x27;.

=== 21st century: gentrification ===

In recent times the area has had a reputation for successful ethnic diversity and centrality. The area&#x27;s proximity to major areas of employment, including Westminster, the West End and the City, has meant that a certain amount of gentrification has taken place.

From the mid-2000s, the area became the subject to a master-planned redevelopment budgeted at £1.5 billion. A Development Framework was approved by Southwark Council in 2004. It covers 170 acres (688,000 m2) and envisages restoring the Elephant to the role of major urban hub for inner London that it occupied before World War II. There have been moves to protect the last of the architecturally important tenement blocks nearby through the creation of a conservation area covering the Pullens buildings.

A substantial amount of post-World War II social housing that was claimed to have failed by the Council has been demolished, including the Heygate Estate, replaced with developments consisting of a mix of social and private-sector housing and a 2-acres green space, Elephant Park, part of rebranding the whole development. This portion of the site is being developed by Lendlease. The site includes what the developers called &quot;one of the largest new parks in Central London in 70 years&quot;, which only became part of the project after protests from local activists to retain as many of the mature trees on the site as possible. A large water feature and paddling pool, named Elephant Springs, is located in the north eastern quarter of the park.

In 2022, a timber pavilion, called The Tree House, and designed architect studio Bell Phillips, opened. The structure is triangular and is built around a tree. It includes public toilets, a cafe, and a viewing gallery on the roof.

Locally, tall, mainly residential buildings have been approved or are under construction since the 148-metre Strata SE1 tower was completed in 2010. These include:
*One The Elephant (124m)
*Highpoint a residential build-to-rent building (134m), which also includes affordable housing, Council housing, a café and a theatre space leased to the Southwark Playhouse.
*&quot;Two Fifty One&quot; Southwark Bridge Road (134m)
*&quot;Elephant Central&quot; (three high-rise buildings on a shared podium).

Southwark Council opened the new Castle leisure centre in 2016. This replaced the original Castle centre, which closed in 2012.

In 2015, the new owners of the shopping centre, Delancey, announced redevelopment plans for a new &quot;town centre&quot;, which is due to be completed by the mid-2020s. The project is in two phases. The first aims to replace the existing shopping centre and the Coronet Theatre, and comprise:
*a new campus building for the nearby London College of Communication (LCC)
*a cinema
*retail units and housing.
*a new underground station entrance, though funding is currently uncertain.
Once the first phase is completed, the current site of the LCC is to be redeveloped to host residential towers and a live-music venue.

In February 2014, a small shipper-container precinct on three levels, inspired by the Boxpark concept, was put together at the corner of the Walworth Road and Elephant Road. Baptised The Artworks, the venue hosted small start-up businesses and a library. The project was closed and demolished in 2019.

London&#x27;s Latin American population, prominent from this zone to Stockwell, has been an inspiration to aspects of the regeneration. Plans are being made for shops and artwork to emphasise a Latin American corridor.

In December 2018, it was announced that London Mayor Sadiq Khan had approved redevelopment plans, and that Southwark Council had too, after changes to proposals to ensure more windows in the shopping centre, 350 out of 1000 homes for rent at &quot;genuinely affordable levels&quot; and for traders in the current centre with rents capped for 15 years. A judicial review of the decision was finally lost by campaigners in May 2021.

In January 2020, a closure date was set for the centre of 30 July 2020. The closure date was postponed to 24 September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. and the centre will be redeveloped. Demolition of the shopping centre, Hannibal House and the Coronet theatre started in January 2021.

In November 2023, Elephant Park was the winner of the Public Space - Building Beauty Award, handed out by the Royal Fine Art Commission Trust.

==Transport==

=== London Underground ===

Elephant &amp; Castle tube station serves the area.

The station is served by Northern line trains on the Bank branch, linking the area directly to the City, and destinations such as London Bridge, King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, and Camden Town to the north. Southbound trains travel towards Morden via key destinations such as Kennington, Clapham, and South Wimbledon and Battersea following the opening of the line&#x27;s extension from Kennington as of the Autumn of 2021.

The station is the southern terminus of the Bakerloo line, which runs northbound to Harrow and Wealdstone. The line links the area to Waterloo, the West End, Paddington, Willesden, and Wembley Central along the way.

The station is on the boundary between London fare zones 1 and 2.

Transport for London (TfL) has proposed extending the Bakerloo line southwards from Elephant &amp; Castle to Lewisham. The line would run beneath the Old Kent Road down to New Cross.

=== National Rail ===
Elephant &amp; Castle railway station is served by Southeastern and Thameslink trains (More so by Thameslink services), which serve destinations across London, the South East, and East England. Key destinations include Ashford International, Bedford, Dover Priory, London Blackfriars (in the city), Luton and Luton Airport (), St Albans City, St Pancras International, Sutton, and Wimbledon.

The station is on the boundary between London fare zones 1 and 2.

===Buses===
Elephant &amp; Castle is served by London Buses routes 1, 12, 35, 40, 45, 53, 63, 68, 133, 136, 148, 155, 171, 172, 176, 188, 196, 333, 343, 344, 360, 363, 415, 453, 468, C10, P5, N1, N63, N68, N89, N133, N155, N171 and N343.

=== Cycling ===

TfL and the London Borough of Southwark maintain cycling infrastructure in the area.

In 2014 the northern junction was &quot;Britain&#x27;s highest cycle casualty roundabout&quot;.

Elephant and Castle is the southern terminus of Cycleway 6, which runs northwards to Blackfriars, Farringdon, Bloomsbury, and King&#x27;s Cross. The cycleway runs unbroken and signposted along the entirety of its route. The section between Elephant and Castle and Farringdon runs along traffic-free bike freeway. The northern terminus of C6 is in Kentish Town.

Cycle Superhighway 7 passes north–south through Elephant and Castle. The route is signposted and carries cyclists from Elephant and Castle northbound to the city, via Southwark Bridge. Southbound, the route runs without interruption to Collier&#x27;s Wood, via Kennington, Stockwell, Clapham, and Tooting.

A shared-use path for pedestrians and cyclists runs alongside New Kent Road east from Elephant and Castle, which links the area to the nearby Bricklayer&#x27;s Arms.

The Santander Cycles bicycle-sharing system operates in Elephant and Castle.

=== Road ===
Elephant and Castle is a busy road junction. The London Inner Ring Road passes through the junction. The A3 also passes through the junction, which carries traffic between the city and destinations such as Kennington, Clapham, Gatwick Airport (), and Portsmouth.

Air pollution from road traffic in Elephant and Castle has significantly improved in recent years. In 2015, Elephant and Castle exceeded the UK government legal limit on Nitrogen Dioxide, with the local borough recording an annual mean concentration of 41 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m^3). In 2017, this figure was 34μg/m^3, below the legal limit, and in 2018, the figure was 32μg/m^3. The limit set by the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs is 40μg/m^3.

The Elephant was to have been served by the Cross-River Tram, which was cancelled in 2008 due to budgetary constraints.

In 2010, the southern roundabout was converted to traffic light operation, with the creation of new cycle lanes and pedestrian crossings. This included the removal of the pedestrian subways, described as &quot;unpopular and imtimidating&quot; by a local councillor.

In 2014 the Elephant &amp; Castle junction was still &quot;Britain&#x27;s highest cycle casualty roundabout&quot;, prompting a TfL proposal to remove the northern roundabout as part of a £4bn package of road improvements targeting cyclists&#x27; safety. TfL implemented its proposal in 2015, connecting the roundabout island to the shopping centre, thereby creating a new public space called Elephant Square.

<doc id="234203" wikidata="Q7009649" url="?curid=234203" title="New Kent Road">
<text>New Kent Road is a road in the London Borough of Southwark. The road was created in 1751 when the Turnpike Trust upgraded a local footpath. This was done as part of the general road improvements associated with the creation of Westminster Bridge; in effect it was possible to travel from the West End/ Westminster to the south-east without having to go via the Borough of Southwark but could now cross St George&#x27;s Fields to the junction of Newington Causeway and Newington Butts which is where New Kent Road starts at Elephant &amp; Castle. The route runs eastward for a few hundred yards to the junction of Great Dover Street and Tower Bridge Road, known as Bricklayers Arms, where it joins the original route to the south-east Old Kent Road (the A2).

The road forms part of the London Inner Ring Road and as such forms part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone. New Kent Road is designated the A201 which, to the north-west past the Elephant &amp; Castle, becomes London Road.

In 1878, historian Edward Walford noted that the New Kent Road was formerly named Greenwich Road, and explained that &quot;[it] is a broad and open roadway; it has been lately planted on either side with trees, so that in course of time it will doubtless form a splendid boulevard, of the Parisian type, and one worthy of being copied in many other parts of London.&quot;

The 1955 &quot;Survey of London&quot; still maintained that &quot;[the] road also has a spaciousness lacking in many of its 19th-century counterparts, for the 1751 Act stipulated that the road should be not less than wide and many of the older houses still retain their front gardens.&quot; Just a few older houses still remain, mostly on the south side.

==South side==
===Elephant and Castle to Elephant Road===
The southern side of New Kent Road starts at the site of the former Elephant &amp; Castle Shopping Centre, built in the 1960s and often cited as London&#x27;s ugliest building. It was demolished in 2021.

The 1955 Survey of London reports that 16–18 New Kent Road, part of the current site of the Shopping Centre, was &quot;the auction yard for horses, ponies and vehicles known as the London (Elephant and Castle) Repository.&quot;

At 26 New Kent Road, a pub attached to the Shopping Centre was named after a famous local ex-resident Charlie Chaplin. It is said that Chaplin had a martini at the pub during a visit to the area in the 1950s. It closed in 2018 and was demolished in 2020.

Until it closed in 2018 The Coronet club and music venue stood at 28 New Kent Road. The site was first occupied by the Theatre Royal, built in 1872 and destroyed by fire only six years later. Rebuilt as the Elephant and Castle Theatre in 1879, Charlie Chaplin performed there. It was converted to an ABC cinema in 1928. After several more name changes, it became the Coronet Cinema in 1981. The Coronet Cinema closed down in 1999, leaving the Elephant &amp; Castle area with no cinemas.

Elephant Road is a short road that connects New Kent Road with the Walworth Road. The railway arches on the west side house businesses including a bike shop, Corsica Studios art space and several businesses selling Latin American goods.

===Elephant Road to Rodney Place===

East of the railway bridge is the site of the large Elephant Park complex of businesses and residential units which is still under construction. It is being developed by Oakmayne Properties who also built the nearby South Central East residential building on Walworth Road. The site of Oakmayne Plaza was formerly occupied by UK&#x27;s largest used Volvo showroom and the Elephant Road Industrial Estate. From Elephant Road to Rodney Place previously stood the Heygate Estate
In the summer of 2008, a high sculpture of a stag by Ben Long was erected on the Oakmayne Plaza site. It was constructed from scaffolding materials, and after a few months was dismantled and reformed into a new structure on a new site.

Multi-coloured spherical lights in the trees were installed in 2005 by the Elephant Impacts project. The project has repainted and added feature lighting to a number of bridges and buildings in the area, including the adjoining railway bridges on Walworth Road and Newington Causeway, and to London College of Communication and the Metropolitan Tabernacle. Proposed feature lighting at Metro Central Heights was abandoned when residents feared it would cause light pollution.

Crossway United Reformed Church was the last part of the Heygate Estate that remained standing, until it closed in 2017 and was relocated to a new building nearby. The &quot;Two Caryatids&quot; sculpture by Henry Poole, originally created in 1897 for the old Rotherhithe Public Library, stood in a locked garden behind the church for many years, but was removed in 2009

A footbridge that connected the Heygate Estate with the north side of New Kent Road was demolished in 2014.

===Beyond Rodney Place===
At 128 New Kent Road, Watling House is a new development of flats managed by the Landmark Housing Association.

The distinctive Baroque style building at 172–180 is Driscoll House. It was originally built as a women&#x27;s hostel in 1913 and became a hostel primarily aimed at international students, until it closed in 2007. It reopened as Restup London in 2012, extensively refurbished but with some of the distinctive tiled interiors of Driscoll House still intact.

There is a small green space next to Driscoll House, and beyond Searles Road there is a larger one called Paragon Gardens, named after the building erected on the site in 1787, designed by Michael Searles the Surveyor of the Rolls Estate. It was demolished in the 1890s when the road was widened and replaced with more modest housing — on Searles Road — and the Paragon School for Girls and Boys, later under the ILEA (Inner London Education Authority) Paragon Secondary Boys&#x27; School with Sixth Form. The school closed in 1988 and was for a number of years run by Southwark Council as a centre for Evening Classes and art studios before finally being sold for private development and converted into a residential building named The Paragon.

===Metro Central Heights to Falmouth Road===
The first few hundred yards of New Kent Road consist of the Elephant and Castle pub and the Metro Central Heights residential block, although both premises have addresses on Newington Causeway, not New Kent Road. A plaque next to the Metro Central Heights convenience store explains that this was previously the site of the Trocadero Cinema at 1–17 New Kent Road, which closed in 1963.

Beyond the railway bridge stands Albert Barnes House, an 18-storey block of council flats owned by the London Borough of Southwark. From 1883 to 1886, this was the site of a fish and provisions market promoted by Samuel Plimsoll.
Albert Barnes House was completed in 1964 and contains 99 flats. There was a serious fire in Albert Barnes House in the early hours of 30 January 2007 and all 250 residents were evacuated. One flat was gutted, and another seriously damaged 

At Meadow Row stands St Matthews at the Elephant, a contemporary Anglican church and community centre built in 1993 on a site near to the old St Matthew&#x27;s church (&quot;Southwark Holy Trinity and St Matthew&quot;) which was demolished in 1992. The church has particularly good acoustics and hosts musical performances as well as community events and services. The main building is built low, with the separate minimalist iron spire at the street entrance suggesting old and new-style church architecture simultaneously. It includes some rented flats.

83 New Kent Road is a residence for students at the nearby London South Bank University, with 81 students living in shared flats.

===Falmouth Road junction===
The small Falmouth Road Park opened in March 2006. The original bench was made from timber from a London plane tree that once stood on the Tower of London Wharf, and featured designs created by local children. The bench deteriorated and was replaced with a plain design in 2022. The park became popular with street drinkers, addicts and homeless people, and in November 2024 Southwark council installed lockable gates and started locking the park from sunset to 0730.

Next to the park, Tavern Court at number 95 is a six-storey shared-ownership residential building managed by Family Mosaic Housing Association, and which opened in 2005. The site was previously occupied by the County Terrace Tavern, a pub that was built in 1811. At the Old Bailey in 1836, the proprietor&#x27;s lawyer insisted that the County Terrace Tavern was misnamed: &quot;the right name is County Coffee-house—they should alter it—it is situated in the county Terrace, New Kent-road.&quot;. It closed in 2003 and was demolished.

The Museum of London Archaeology Service surveyed the site in May 2004 and found that &quot;There was no evidence to confirm that this site was occupied until the post medieval period. It appears that this low lying area ... was fields until the development of the County Terrace public house and adjoining properties during the 19th century. A thick layer of top soil containing 18th and 19th century material including broken bricks, clay pipe stems and 19th century pottery was found.&quot;

The 1888 red brick church behind Tavern Court is the former Welsh Presbyterian Chapel, a listed building designed by Charles Evans-Vaughan in mixed Queen Anne and Romanesque revival styles. English Heritage comments that &quot;[the] combination of different features and materials [is] calculated to produce a most variable and picturesque composition. An early instance of the Queen Anne manner applied to a church or chapel.&quot; Since 1991, the church has been the main London home of the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star, an African Initiated Church based in Nigeria and led by Olumba Olumba Obu, who followers describe as &quot;the sole spiritual head of the universe&quot;. Worshippers wear distinctive white robes known as &quot;soutane&quot;, with women also wearing a wimple-like headdress.

===David Copperfields Garden===
The narrow public garden from here to Harper Road is called David Copperfields Garden. A plaque placed on a plinth in the garden in September 1931 by the Dickens Fellowship explained that this was the place where in the Charles Dickens novel, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; stopped &quot;in the Kent Road ... at a terrace with a piece of water before it, and a great foolish image in the middle, blowing a dry shell&quot;. The plinth had a small statue that eventually lost both its shell and its head to vandalism. The plinth and plaque were removed in 2006 when the park was closed for redevelopment.

It reopened in July 2007 after a complete re-landscaping, including removal of the railings between the footpath and the garden. The original design included benches based on the milestones that David Copperfield passed on his fictional journey, but the final version has no benches. With the removal of the plinth and plaque, the only remaining reference to the Dickens novel is a quotation from Copperfield&#x27;s aunt inlaid into the path through the park: &quot;...a little change, and a glimpse of life out of doors, may be useful, in helping you to know your own mind...&quot;

===Harper Road to the Bricklayers Arms===
At the corner of Harper Road is a five-storey residential block comprising fifteen apartments, with a branch of Tesco Metro on the ground floor. The site formerly housed Pole Position, a motorcycle workshop and racing team HQ that relocated to East London in 2009.

Adjacent to this is a short parade of commercial premises. In 2005, journalist Peter Preston noted that the multi-cultural nature of the area is that this block of businesses includes an African hairdresser, a Turkish grocers, a Chinese take-away and a Bolivian restaurant. Only the Bolivian restaurant remains.

The petrol station and attached supermarket have rebranded many times. Originally a BP station with a Safeway shop, it became a Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Food store, then in 2016 a Spar forecourt supermarket in 2016 when the petrol station changed from a to Esso franchise. The commercial premises now includes a branch of Costa Coffee. The building was home to an Amazon locker until its removal in 2019.

The last building on the north side of New Kent Road, after Bartholemew Street, is St Saviour&#x27;s and St Olave&#x27;s Church of England School on land given by Lord LLangatock (of the Rolls family) to the ancient Southwark grammar school foundation which was required to provide a girls school to supplement its teaching of boys. This opened in 1903 as a grammar school and is for girls aged 11 to 18.

Bricklayers Arms is the site of an important road intersection with the Old Kent Road and was formerly the site of an important railway terminus.

<text>Pentonville Road is a road in Central London that runs west to east from Kings Cross to City Road at The Angel, Islington. The road is part of the London Inner Ring Road and part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone.

The road was originally built in the mid-18th century as part of the New Road, a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the new town of Pentonville, that encouraged manufacturing to move out of the city and into suburbia. Numerous factories and commercial premises became established on the road in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.

As industrial manufacturing fell out of favour in London in the late 20th century, many properties are now residential or student accommodation. Current premises include the Crafts Council Gallery on the site of a former chapel, the Scala nightclub in a former cinema, and The Castle, a public house.

==Geography==
The road is long and runs east from King&#x27;s Cross station as a continuation of Euston Road. It ends at the Angel, Islington, at a junction with Islington High Street and Goswell Road; the road ahead becoming City Road. Only eastbound traffic can travel on the full extent of the road; westbound traffic is diverted south via Swinton Street. The road is on the London Inner Ring Road (A501) and as such forms part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone. Since 1995, it has been a red route, prohibiting stopping of any kind, including loading and unloading.

Most of the road is in the London Borough of Islington but a small part near Kings Cross is in the London Borough of Camden, including the King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink railway station and the &quot;Lighthouse&quot; Block. London Underground and National Rail stations in the vicinity include Kings Cross and Angel Underground station.

There has been a bus service on Pentonville Road since 1829. Regular bus routes running along the road are 30, 73 and 146.

==History==

What is now Pentonville Road was built as the final section of the New Road in 1756, connecting the City of London to the western suburbs, so that coach traffic could avoid Central London. At the time, the route now covered by Pentonville Road was mostly fields, with Battle Bridge occupying the space where King&#x27;s Cross now is. It included a tavern known as Busby&#x27;s Folly, a meeting place of a drinking group known as the Society of Bull Feathers. It is marked on John Ogilby&#x27;s map of London in 1675. It was moved around 1780 to Penton Street and renamed the Belvedere Tavern. The current building dates from 1876.

The road was designed as part of Pentonville, a new suburb away from the city and became a local hub for manufacturing in the area. There was some debate over the final route of the road; the original plan to run straight through fields owned by the Skinners Company and the New River Company was rejected in favour of the route further north via Battle Bridge. As it was always intended to be a main road, a coach service began in 1798 between Paddington and Bank but was quickly withdrawn. The road was turnpiked in 1830 and renamed Pentonville Road after landowner Henry Penton in 1857. Until 1882, the upkeep of the road was paid by the local parish, paying a ground rent to Penton&#x27;s estate for the disused toll house at No. 274.

The street is distinguished by the &quot;set back&quot; housing lines originally intended to provide an atmosphere of spaciousness along the thoroughfare. The original 1756 act to create the New Road prohibited the construction of any building within of its side. Though the area had been designed to be a pleasant suburb, the arrival of railways in the 1840s turned the road into an industrial urban street, with factories and workshops aligning the road. The original bylaw restricting property on the front of the road was ignored and shops were built on top of gardens.

By the 21st century, most of the manufacturing base along Pentonville Road had disappeared. The original townhouses are now apartments.

==Properties==
Alexander Cumming, former clockmaker and organ builder to Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, built a house at No. 166 Pentonville Road. In 1807, the year after his death, the house became the London Female Penitentiary, housing &quot;fallen women&quot; and rehabilitating them into society. It was extended between 1811 and 1812, roughly tripling its capacity, and moved to Stoke Newington in 1884.

The Thomas S. Jones organ builders were based at No. 25 Pentonville Road between 1860 and 1935. The Dunn &amp; Hewett cocoa factory was established at No. 9 Pentonville Road in 1833 by Daniel Dunn, who went into partnership with Charles Hewett in the 1850s. The business claimed to have invented soluble chocolate and cocoa, and moved to No. 136, expanding to No. 138 in the 1870s. The building was enlarged and partially rebuilt over the 1880s and 90s, and included a staff tea-room at No. 140 by 1907. The factory closed around 1930 and was subsequently sub-let to various businesses. The Ealing Radiator Company was established at Nos. 152–154 Pentonville Road in 1936, manufacturing car radiators. A first floor extension was added in 1952, while Nos. 136–150 were cleared to accommodate a low metal-framed building. These premises have now been sub-let to various businesses.
The Claremont Chapel was at No. 44a Pentonville Road. It was named after Claremont House, home of the then-recently deceased Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales. The chapel was built by Thomas Wilson, who acquired the 2-acre site in 1818 for £700, spending an additional £6,000 on building works. It opened in October 1819, though a regular pastor was not appointed until 1822. The building was extended in 1847 to accommodate a Sunday school, while sash windows were installed in 1853. In 1860, the building was refurbished and given a Classical facade, but reducing the capacity of the inside gallery. Attendance declined and the chapel was sold to the London Congregational Union, before closing in 1899. It re-opened in 1902 as Claremont Hall, a mission institute. It was let for commercial purposes in the 1960s, and sub-let to the Crafts Council in 1991. The building is now the Crafts Council Gallery, a public gallery funded by the Arts Council England. It contains a number of exhibition rooms that are available for use.

The block of properties at No. 295–297 Pentonville Road, at its junction with Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, is known as the &quot;Lighthouse Block&quot; owing to the lead clad tower at the top of the building. The site avoided being compulsory purchased and demolished (in order to provide improvements to King&#x27;s Cross station&#x27;s eastern entrance) and is now Grade II listed.

The Vernon Square school opened on Pentonville Road in 1913, expanding to cover secondary school students in 1949. It was renamed the Sir Philip Magnus School in 1952 and closed in the 1970s. It became part of Kingsway College before being purchased by the School of Oriental and African Studies in 2001. The SOAS has several other halls of residence along Pentonville Road, including Dinwiddy House.
The Lexington is a music venue at Nos. 96-98. It has played host to local bands, and as a warm-up venue for more established acts. The Scala at No. 275–277 Pentonville Road opened as the King&#x27;s Cross Cinema in 1920 with a capacity of 1,300. Construction had begun just before World War I and was halted because of it. It was damaged by bombs during World War II, and while it remained open during wartime, it eventually had to be shut between 1949 and 1952 for renovations and repair. It closed in 1970, and re-opened as an independent cinema, which showed old 16mm films including &quot;King Kong&quot;. The Stooges played their only gig in London at the venue in June 1972, shortly before recording the album &quot;Raw Power&quot; with David Bowie; a shot of Iggy Pop onstage here became the album&#x27;s front cover. The venue closed in 1992, and is now a nightclub.

The Castle is a pub at No. 54 Pentonville Road, at the junction with Baron Street. In 2015, the perpetrators of the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary met at the pub to discuss the crime shortly after it occurred, but were secretly filmed there by the Flying Squad. All were subsequently arrested and sent to prison. The current owners, Geronimo Inns, wish to distance themselves from the burglary and forbid staff to discuss it with customers.

The original Angel, Islington, sits at the far east end of Pentonville Road, at its junction with Islington High Street. It was named after the Angel of the Annunciation that appeared on its sign. The inn pre-dated the construction of Pentonville Road, and had become one of the largest coaching inns in the local area by the 18th century. The site was cut in two by the construction of the road, with the inn remaining on the north side. A new building was constructed in 1899, later becoming a Lyons Corner House. It closed in 1959, and was threatened with demolition as a plan to improve junction improvements around Pentonville Road, but survived and is now partly occupied by a branch of The Co-operative Bank.

The poet John Betjeman&#x27;s parents ran a cabinet makers at No. 34–42 Pentonville Road. It was established since 1859 and produced the Tantalus drinks cabinet in 1881.

Pentonville Road is one of the locations on the London version of the Monopoly board game. It is one of the light blue squares alongside The Angel, Islington and Euston Road, both of which it connects to.

The magazine &quot;Mixmag&quot;″s main offices are at Nos. 90–92 Pentonville Road.

<text>In sales, commerce, and economics, a customer (sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser) is the recipient of a good, service, product, or an idea, obtained from a seller, vendor, or supplier via a financial transaction or an exchange for money or some other valuable consideration.

==Etymology and terminology==
Early societies relied on a gift economy based on favours. Later, as commerce developed, less permanent human relations were formed, depending more on transitory needs rather than enduring social desires. Customers are generally said to be the purchasers of goods and services, while clients are those who receive personalized advice and solutions. Although such distinctions have no contemporary semantic weight, agencies such as law firms, film studios, and health care providers tend to prefer &quot;client&quot;, while grocery stores, banks, and restaurants tend to prefer &quot;customer&quot; instead.

===Client===

The term client is derived from Latin &quot;clients&quot; or &quot;care&quot; meaning &quot;to incline&quot; or &quot;to bend&quot;, and is related to the emotive idea of closure. It is widely believed that people only change their habits when motivated by greed and fear. Winning a client is therefore a singular event, which is why professional specialists who deal with particular problems tend to attract long-term clients rather than regular customers. Unlike regular customers, who buy merely on price and value, long-term clients buy on experience and trust.

===Customer===
Clients who habitually return to a seller develop customs that allow for regular, sustained commerce that allows the seller to develop statistical models to optimize production processes (which change the nature or form of goods or services) and supply chains (which change the location or formalize the changes of ownership or entitlement transactions). 

An &quot;end customer&quot; denotes the person at the end of a supply chain who ultimately purchases or utilised the goods or services.

===Employer===
A client paying for construction work is often referred to as an &quot;employer&quot;.

== Customer segmentation ==

In the 21st century, customers are generally categorized into two types:
* an entrepreneur or trader (sometimes a commercial Intermediary) - a dealer who purchases goods for re-sale.
* an end user or ultimate customer who does not re-sell the things bought but is the actual consumer or an agent such as a Purchasing officer for the consumer.
A customer may or may not also be a consumer, but the two notions are distinct. A customer &quot;purchases&quot; goods; a consumer &quot;uses&quot; them. An ultimate customer &quot;may&quot; be a consumer as well, but just as equally may have purchased items for someone else to consume. An intermediate customer is not a consumer at all. The situation is somewhat complicated in that ultimate customers of so-called &quot;industrial&quot; goods and services (who are entities such as government bodies, manufacturers, and educational and medical institutions) either themselves use up the goods and services that they buy, or incorporate them into other finished products, and so are technically consumers, too. However, they are rarely called that, but are rather called industrial customers or business-to-business customers. Similarly, customers who buy services rather than goods are rarely called consumers.

Six Sigma doctrine places (active) customers in opposition to two other classes of people: &quot;not-&quot;customers and &quot;non-&quot;customers:
* Customers of a given business have actively dealt with that business within a particular recent period that depends on the product sold.
* Not-customers are either past customers who are no longer customers or potential customers who choose to interact with the competition.
* Non-customers are people who are active in a different market segment entirely.

Geoff Tennant, a Six Sigma consultant from the United Kingdom, uses the following analogy to explain the difference: A supermarket&#x27;s customer is the person buying milk at that supermarket; a not-customer buys milk from a competing supermarket, whereas a non-customer does not buy milk from supermarkets at all but rather &quot;has milk delivered to the door in the traditional British way&quot;.

Tennant also categorizes customers in another way that is employed outside the fields of marketing. While marketers, market regulation, and economists use the intermediate/ultimate categorization, the field of customer service more often categorizes customers into two classes:
# An external customer of an organization is a customer who is not directly connected to that organization.
# An internal customer is a customer who is directly connected to an organization, and is usually (but not necessarily) internal to the organization. Internal customers are usually stakeholders, employees, or shareholders, but the definition also encompasses creditors and external regulators.

Before the introduction of the notion of an internal customer, external customers were, simply, customers. Quality-management writer Joseph M. Juran popularized the concept, introducing it in 1988 in the fourth edition of his &quot;Quality Control Handbook&quot; . The idea has since gained wide acceptance in the literature on total quality management and service marketing; and many organizations recognize the customer satisfaction of internal customers as a precursor to, and a prerequisite for, external customer satisfaction, with authors such as regarding service organizations which design products for internal customer satisfaction as better able to satisfy the needs of external customers. Research on the theory and practice of managing the internal customer continues in a variety of service-sector industries.

===Arguments against use of the term &quot;internal customers&quot;===
Leading authors in management and marketing, like Peter Drucker, Philip Kotler, W. Edwards Deming, etc., have not used the term &quot;internal customer&quot; in their works. They consider the &quot;customer&quot; as a very specific role in society which represents a crucial part in the relationship between the demand and the supply. Some of the most important characteristics of any customer are that: any customer is never in a subordination line with any supplier; any customer has equal positions with the supplier within negotiations, and any customer can accept or reject any offer for a service or a product. Peter Drucker wrote, &quot;They are all people who can say no, people who have the choice to accept or reject what you offer.&quot;

In opposition to the stated customer&#x27;s characteristics, relationships between colleagues in a company are always based on subordination – direct or indirect. Company employees are obliged to follow the processes of their companies. Company employees do not have the authority to choose a unit/colleague to fulfill any task. Company employees are obliged to use an existing unit/colleague by using the company&#x27;s structure and approved processes, therefore these internal relationships are not considered as an option.

Many authors in ITIL and Six Sigma methodologies define &quot;internal customer&quot; as an internal part of a company that uses the output of another part of a company as its input. But actually, this definition describes better a classical internal process rather than a relationship between a customer and a supplier. Peter Drucker considers that there are no customers inside organizations. He wrote &quot;Inside an organization, there are only cost centers. The only profit center is a customer whose check has not bounced.&quot; In addition, William Deming advises managers, in his 9th point, to &quot;Break down barriers between departments. They must work as a team&quot;, which means that there have to be teamwork in a company rather than a supplier/customer relationship. One more argument, even the ITIL methodology admits that &quot;the term &#x27;colleague&#x27; may be more accurate in describing how two internal groups are related to one another.&quot;.

<doc id="234208" wikidata="Q5123401" url="?curid=234208" title="City Road">
<text>City Road or The City Road is a road that runs through central London. The northwestern extremity of the road is at Angel where it forms a continuation of Pentonville Road. Pentonville Road itself is the modern name for the eastern part of London&#x27;s first bypass, the New Road from Paddington to Islington, which was constructed in 1756. The City Road was built in 1761 as a continuation of that route to the City of London.

==Route==
From Angel, City Road runs roughly south-east and downhill past the City Road Basin of Regent&#x27;s Canal and Moorfields Eye Hospital, after which it bears closer to south, and has a junction with Old Street at the former Old Street Roundabout. After Old Street, it continues south, continuing past Bunhill Fields, Wesley&#x27;s Chapel and the Honourable Artillery Company, after which the road continues south as Finsbury Square, then Finsbury Pavement, then Moorgate—the latter beginning at the border with the City of London. These roads form a major entry point into the City of London, and were extended in 1846 through the City itself (as Princes Street and King William Street) to connect with London Bridge.
The part of the road north of Old Street is on the London Inner Ring Road and as such forms part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone. The ring road continues east along Old Street. Most of the road is in the London Borough of Islington, although the stretch from Wharf Road down to Old Street is the border between Islington and Hackney, so the two sides are in different boroughs.

==Transport links==
Nearby London Underground stations are , and Moorgate. The disused City Road station was on City Road itself.

London Bus routes serving the length of City Road include 43, 205, 214, 394.

==Cultural references==
The City Road and The Eagle tavern are mentioned in an additional verse written for the nursery rhyme &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; by 1856, when it was quoted in a performance at the Theatre Royal:

The Eagle was a well-known public house on City Road, which was rebuilt as a music hall on 1825, was later renamed the Grecian Theatre, became a Salvation Army centre in 1884, and was demolished in 1901. Its site is now occupied by Eagle Dwellings, a housing complex administered by the Peabody Trust. A replacement Eagle pub, opened in 1901, was erected in Shepherdess Walk, on the opposite (north-east) side of City Road: this still stands, and the rhyme is painted on a plaque on its façade.

<text>Old Street is a street in inner north-east Central London, England that runs west to east from Goswell Road in Clerkenwell, in the London Borough of Islington, via St Luke&#x27;s and Old Street Roundabout, to the crossroads where it meets Shoreditch High Street (south), Kingsland Road (north) and Hackney Road (east) in Shoreditch in the London Borough of Hackney.

It has London Underground station Old Street on the Northern line which has other platforms for National Rail&#x27;s Northern City Line.

Its west half is inside London&#x27;s Congestion Charging Zone. The street&#x27;s middle (from Old Street Station to Great Eastern Street) follows the zone&#x27;s eastern boundary, while the street&#x27;s eastern end falls entirely outside the zone.

==History==

Old Street was recorded as &quot;Ealdestrate&quot; in about 1200, and &quot;le Oldestrete&quot; in 1373. As befits its name there are some suggestions that the road is of ancient origin. It lies on the route of an old Roman or possibly pre-Roman track connecting Silchester and Colchester, skirting round the walls of Londinium, today the areas known as the City of London.

The western part was widened between 1872 and 1877, but it narrows east of Coronet Street; there survive, at No.s. 340-342 on the south side of the street and No.s. 323 and 325-329 on the north side, some domestic buildings from the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, though somewhat battered and altered in function. At the east end of Old Street there is a notable deviation of the line of the street as it joins the old Roman Road north to York. This deviation is visible on old maps but unexplained, and is today fronted by Shoreditch Town Hall and the former Shoreditch Magistrates Court (now a hotel). Together with St Leonard&#x27;s, Shoreditch at the east end of Old Street, this was the civic hub of the former Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch.

The eastern half of the road is on the London Inner Ring Road and forms part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone. Old Street and the surrounding areas of Hoxton Square and Great Eastern Street host a thriving night life. The street and its adjacent areas have attracted IT and tech companies, both established and start-ups, and Old Street Roundabout, located at the junction with City Road, has been dubbed Silicon Roundabout. Old Street station is located under the roundabout. With the increase in passenger numbers using the station, in 2014 Transport for London announced that it was to offer pop-up retail space there as part of a drive to increase its revenue.

Old Street has become favoured for notable graffiti artists such as Banksy and Jef Aérosol. Banksy has featured several pieces on &quot;Shoreditch Bridge&quot;.

*N55: Woodford Wells - Oxford Circus via Clapton
*205: Paddington - Bow via Angel
*214: Moorgate - Highgate via Camden Town

<doc id="234214" wikidata="Q5122150" url="?curid=234214" title="Commercial Street, London">
<text>Commercial Street is an arterial road in the boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Hackney that runs north to south from Shoreditch High Street to Whitechapel High Street through Spitalfields. The road is a section of the A1202 London Inner Ring Road and as such forms part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone.

As the name implies, Commercial Street has historically been dominated by industrial and commercial activity in East End, which it maintains to this day. It is on the City of London fringes, and much industry that was seen as too noisome for the City was once exiled to such areas as this. However, since the early 1990s the street has grown increasingly fashionable, while maintaining its busy commercial feel.

==History==
Spitalfields was historically one of the poorest, most overcrowded and most crime-ridden districts in London: a parliamentary report of 1838 described this area as harbouring &quot;an extremely immoral population; women of the lowest character, receivers of stolen goods, thieves and the most atrocious offenders&quot;. The southern section of Commercial Street was created in 1843–5 as part of a slum clearance programme, and to connect the Whitechapel thoroughfare with Spitalfields Market. It was laid out by the architect and planner Sir James Pennethorne along the approximate line of former Essex Street, Rose Lane and Red Lion Street, and entailed the demolition of some 250 sub-standard properties in Whitechapel and Spitalfields. The extension north from the market, to the Eastern Counties Railway&#x27;s Bishopsgate terminus and to Shoreditch High Street, was made between 1849 and 1857 and opened in 1858. In both phases of development there was some initial difficulty in finding tenants for the building plots, and much of the street was not built up until the 1860s and 1870s. Only once Great Eastern Street had been laid out further north between 1872 and 1876, creating a continuation of the route towards Old Street and the City Road, did Commercial Street really begin to succeed as what had always been Pennethorne&#x27;s aim, an artery allowing traffic to bypass the City of London. With the implementation of the London Congestion Zone in the 2000s, the road has once again seen continued activity from private and commercial vehicles seeking to avoid the 7am–6pm charge, and is a typical arterial route for emergency vehicles.

Until the late twentieth century, the street was heavily dominated by the activities of Spitalfields wholesale fruit and vegetable market, and by outlets for the &quot;rag trade&quot; (the wholesale clothing and textile trade). Since the mid-1970s, however, the area has been increasingly subject to a process of gradual gentrification. In part this reflects the changing character of Spitalfields more generally, but in Commercial Street in particular it was stimulated by the departure of the market in 1991 (and subsequent redevelopment of its buildings), the arrival of a number of private residential developments (especially at the northern end of the street), and the introduction of some modest traffic-calming measures. Many of the commercial units in the street are now occupied by fashionable clothing shops or restaurants.

==Topography and architecture==
The street&#x27;s most significant features are Hawksmoor&#x27;s grand Christ Church, on the corner of Fournier Street; and (almost opposite) Spitalfields Market, the old fruit and vegetable market that is now bustling again after a long period of uncertainty. Both the market buildings and Christ Church are lucky survivors, as demolition has loomed for both of them at one point or another.
The northern end of the street is dominated on its eastern side by the sprawling Exchange Building, an Art Deco former tobacco works, now residential. On the western side stands the former Commercial Street Police Station (built 1874-5, with an extra storey added in 1906), also now a residential block named Burhan Uddin House. Just to its south, with a wing extending into Folgate Street, is the first tenement block of model dwellings to be erected by the Peabody Donation Fund (now the Peabody Trust) for London&#x27;s &quot;industrious poor&quot;. The red-brick Jacobethan block was designed by H. A. Darbishire and opened in 1864, but was sold by the Trust in the late 1970s and is now a private residential block named The Cloisters.

On the opposite corner of Fournier Street from Christ Church is the Ten Bells, a pub that is popularly associated with Jack the Ripper, as two of his female prostitute victims are supposed to have frequented the establishment. Many Ripper tours (a thriving trade) start out nearby. Although the pub has long been refurbished, it still retains some fine original tilework. Prostitution remained a feature of Commercial Street until recently. Dorset Street, which ran off Commercial Street to the west immediately south of Spitalfields Market, was dubbed the &quot;worst street in London&quot;.

Much of the southern section of the street is occupied by warehouse buildings of the 1860s. Wentworth Street (part of the busy Petticoat Lane Market) runs off Commercial Street to the west. Immediately to the south of Wentworth Street lies the Holland Estate, a social housing estate with elements dating back to the 1920s, but which is dominated on its Commercial Street frontage by blocks of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including a 22-storey tower block, Denning Point. The estate is now managed by Eastend Homes, and in 2012 was undergoing a major programme of regeneration that would see the demolition and replacement of several of the blocks. To the south again is the 11-storey Ibis London City budget hotel (opened 2005), and beyond that, at the junction with Whitechapel High Street, the Relay Building, a 21-storey residential development (completed 2014). On the eastern side of Commercial Street stands Toynbee Hall, the university settlement founded in 1884.

==Nearby stations==
The nearest London Underground station is Aldgate East, at Commercial Street&#x27;s southern end. Shoreditch High Street London Overground station is close to the northern end, by the former Bishopsgate Goods Yard. London Liverpool Street is a National Rail and London Underground interchange, a short walk to the west.

<text>A subterranean river (also known as an underground river) is a river or watercourse that runs wholly or partly beneath the ground, one where the riverbed does not represent the surface of the Earth. It is distinct from an aquifer, which may flow like a river but is contained within a permeable layer of rock or other unconsolidated materials. A river flowing below ground level in an open gorge is not classed as subterranean.

Some natural rivers may be entirely subterranean, collecting in and flowing through cave systems. In karst topography, rivers that originate above ground can disappear into sinkholes, continuing underground until they reappear on the surface downstream, possibly having merged with other subterranean rivers. The longest subterranean river in the world is the Sistema Sac Actun cave system in Mexico.

Subterranean rivers can also be the result of covering over a river or diverting its flow into culverts, usually as part of urban development. Reversing this process is known as &quot;daylighting&quot; a watercourse and is a major form of visible river restoration. Successful examples include the Cheonggyecheon in the centre of Seoul.

Some fish (colloquially known as cavefish) and other troglobite organisms are adapted to life in subterranean rivers and lakes.

Examples of subterranean rivers also occur in mythology and literature.

==Natural examples==

There are many natural examples of subterranean rivers. Among them:
*In Bosnia and Herzegovina: Unac; Mušnica-Trebišnjica-Krupa/Ombla &quot;(Ombla springs out of huge cave near Dubrovnik, Croatia and after just ca. 30 meters empties into Adriatic Sea&#x27;s ria called Rijeka Dubrovačka)&quot;; Zalomka-Buna/Bunica/Bregava; Vrljika-Trebižat; Lištica-Jasenica; Šuica-Ričina
*In Bulgaria:
**Banderishka reka, subterranean section below Kutelo Peak, Pirin Mountain
**Struma River subterranean currents in Duhlata cave, Vitosha Mountain
**Negovanka River subterranean currents in Emen cave, Veliko Tarnovo Province
**Trigradska reka, subterranean section where Devil&#x27;s Throat Cave and Trigrad Gorge, Rhodope Mountains
*The Camuy River located in the northwestern region of Puerto Rico is one of the largest underground river systems in the world.
* The Cross Cave system in Loška Dolina, Slovenia includes 22 subterranean lakes
* The Lost River in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia disappears underground and reappears as the Cacapon River
* The Mojave River in southern California flows underground in most places
* The Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park in Vietnam has an underground river flowing through its cave system
* The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River on the island of Palawan, Philippines flows underground before emerging into the South China Sea
* The Punkva in Moravian Karst, Moravia, Czech Republic underground river flowing through cave system - Punkva Caves and Macocha gorge.
* The Santa Fe River in northern Florida drops into a large sinkhole in O&#x27;Leno State Park and reappears in the adjacent River Rise Preserve State Park, downstream.
* The Reka in Slovenia, which disappears in the Škocjan Caves, re-emerges as part of the Timavo in Italy.

==Artificial examples==

In many cities there are natural streams which have been partially or entirely built over. Such man-made examples of subterranean urban streams are too numerous to list, but notable examples include:
* The Bièvre underneath Paris, France
* The Boyanska reka (Boyana river), partially underneath Sofia, Bulgaria
* Castle Frank Brook, Garrison Creek, Russell Creek, and Taddle Creek, and other subterranean urban streams in Toronto
* The River Farset, which Belfast is named after, which runs in tunnels underneath the city.
* The Fleet and other subterranean rivers of London
* The Frome underneath Bristol
* The Hobart Rivulet in Tasmania
* Mill Creek in Philadelphia
* The Neglinnaya River, which runs through a series of tunnels underneath the central part of Moscow
* The Park River underneath Hartford
* The Spirit Lake Outlet Tunnel underneath Harry&#x27;s Ridge in Skamania County, Washington, United States
* The River Team underneath the Team Valley Trading Estate, Gateshead, United Kingdom
* The Tank Stream underneath Sydney, Australia
* The Zenne underneath Brussels, following the covering of the Zenne between 1865 and 1871

* Subterranean rivers of London
* Subterranean rivers in Hong Kong
==Ecology==
Some fish (popularly known as cavefish) and other troglobite organisms are adapted to life in subterranean rivers and lakes.

==Mythology and literature==
Greek mythology included the Styx, Phlegethon, Acheron, Cocytus, and Lethe as rivers within the Underworld. Dante Alighieri, in his &quot;Inferno&quot;, included the Acheron, Phlegethon, and Styx as rivers within his subterranean Hell. Similar references were made in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The river Alph, running &quot;Through caverns measureless to man / Down to a sunless sea&quot; is central to the poem Kubla Khan, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

The characters in Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; encounter a subterranean river:
&quot;Hans was not mistaken,&quot; he said. &quot;What you hear is the rushing of a torrent.&quot;

&quot;A torrent?&quot; I exclaimed.

&quot;There can be no doubt; a subterranean river is flowing around us.&quot;
Several other novels also feature subterranean rivers. The subterranean rivers of London feature in the novel &quot;Drowning Man&quot; by Michael Robotham as well as in the novel &quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers and Jill Paton Walsh in which a character remarks:
&quot;You can bury them deep under, sir; you can bind them in tunnels, but in the end where a river has been, a river will always be.&quot;

<text>Åke Henriksson Tott (or Achatius Tott; 4 June 1598 – 14 July 1640) was a Swedish nobleman, soldier and politician. His estates included Ekolsund in Sweden, Sjundby in Finland, Polchow in Swedish Pomerania and Lihula in Swedish Livonia.

He was born in Lohja to Princess Sigrid of Sweden and nobleman Henrik Klasson Tott. He was appointed Privy Councilor in 1630, and Field Marshal in 1631.

In the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), he commanded troops at the Battle of Grubin, in 1627 and the Battle of Breitenfeld, in 1631. King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden is said to have called him &quot;the snow plow, who is going to clear the path for the rest&quot;.

He married Sigrid Bielke, and fathered Clas Åkesson Tott the younger, and Åke Henrik Åkesson Tott.

<text>Dodo Freiherr zu Innhausen und Knyphausen (sometimes Knijphausen or Kniphausen; 2 July 1583 – 11 January 1636) was a German professional soldier who saw extensive service in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), rising to the rank of Field Marshal in Swedish service in 1633.

==Early career==
Knyphausen was from Lütetsburg, East Frisia. He learnt his trade in Dutch service under Maurice of Orange, rising to the rank of captain by 1603. He later served the Hanseatic League, then the Protestant Union. In the 1620s, with the Thirty Years&#x27; War turning against the Protestants, Knyphausen had the misfortune to be repeatedly on the losing side, witnessing the defeats at the Battle of Höchst (1622) and the battle of Stadtlohn (1623). After the latter battle he was accused of treason and even sentenced to death, only to be exonerated. He fought under Ernst von Mansfeld at the Battle of Dessau Bridge in 1626, but was captured. In 1628 during the siege of La Rochelle, he went into English service and raised troops, during the final abortive English attempt to relieve the Huguenot stronghold.

==Swedish service==
Knyphausen entered into Swedish service in 1630 and raised several German regiments for the Swedish crown. As a result of his many years of professional experience he was greatly valued by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and was often assigned the most critical tasks, such as the defence of Neubrandenburg in 1631 (where he was captured by the forces of Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly) and command of the Sweden&#x27;s most important military supply base in central Germany at Nuremberg in 1632.

At the 1632 Battle of Lützen, where the Swedish king was killed, Knyphausen, now holding the rank of Major General, was third in command of the Swedish army and responsible for the entire second (reserve) line. At the height of the battle, and with the Swedish army close to panic as a result of the king&#x27;s death and destruction of the Swedish infantry centre, Knyphausen played a large part in holding the Swedish army together for two crucial hours. The Swedish royal secretary Philipp Sattler wrote that Knyphausen had contributed greatly to the final victory, having &quot;done the most to sustain the wavering battleline&quot;.

In January 1633, as a reward for his service at Lützen, Knyphausen was appointed Field Marshal and commander-in-chief of all Swedish forces operating in Lower Saxony, an important side-theatre to the main Swedish operations in Southern Germany. In this role he served at the major Swedish victory at the Battle of Oldendorf in 1633. From 1633 to 1634 he participated in an unsuccessful Siege of Hildesheim. At the minor Battle of Haselünne in early 1636 he was killed.

A distant relative, Edzard zu Innhausen und Knyphausen (1827–1908) was a noted politician.

<doc id="234219" wikidata="Q1376604" url="?curid=234219" title="Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven">
<text>Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven (4 April 1661) was a Scottish army officer. Born illegitimate and raised as a foster child, he subsequently advanced to the rank of field marshal in Swedish Army, and in Scotland became Lord General in command of the Army of the Covenanters, a privy councillor, captain of Edinburgh Castle, Lord Balgonie and Earl of Leven. In England he commanded the Army of the Solemn League and Covenant and was senior commander of the Army of Both Kingdoms (1642–1647). Leslie served in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Bishops&#x27; Wars, and most of the English Civil War, fighting primarily in the First English Civil War. Leslie would live a long life, dying roughly at the age of 80 or 81.

==Early life==
Alexander Leslie was born circa 1580 as an illegitimate son of George Leslie, a captain of Blair Castle, and a mother sometimes described as &quot;a wench in Rannoch&quot;. He was a member of the Clan Leslie.

At an early age, Alexander was fostered out to the Campbells of Glenorchy. The fosterage bond was strong and still written about by Leslie into the 1640s. Indeed, it was this link that brought Leslie into the orbit of the House of Argyll as Lord Lorne, the son of the marquis of Argyll was also a Glenorchy fosterling. This relationship perhaps explains the presence of Campbells in the same regiments as Leslie in Sweden, most notably Captain Charles Campbell (Karl Kammel), whose portrait hangs to this day in Skokloster Castle in Sweden.

==Foreign service==
===Dutch service===
It is sometimes claimed that Alexander Leslie entered Dutch service in 1605, and eventually attained the rank of captain in the Dutch States Army. However, this remains speculated and disputed between many historians.

===Swedish service===
In 1608, he transferred to the Swedish army where he served with distinction. In 1627 the Swedish monarch knighted Alexander Leslie, by now a full colonel, along with three of his countrymen; Patrick Ruthven, David Drummond and John Hepburn. Gustavus Adolphus had a particular affection for him, trusting him with guarding the crucial strategic garrisons in North Germany while the main Swedish army established a foothold on the Baltic shoreline and advanced slowly southwards. In 1628, Leslie was appointed governor during the Siege of Stralsund, replacing Colonel Alexander Seaton and the Scottish regiment of Donald Mackay who had been holding the town on behalf of the Danes. Leslie continued the defence of Stralsund successfully defending the town against Albrecht von Wallenstein&#x27;s imperial army in what effectively constituted Sweden&#x27;s entrance into the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Gustavus Adolfus also sending eight warships to help raise the siege. In 1630 he seized the island of Rügen in the name of the king of Sweden.

In 1631, Leslie organized English and Scottish troops raised for the Swedish army by James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, then the 3rd Marquis of Hamilton, and was promoted Major-General. Leslie was badly wounded in February 1632 near Hamburg. Despite his injury, Leslie was present at the Battle of Lützen (1632). He was appointed Sweden&#x27;s 13th Field Marshal in 1636 and was one of the Swedish commanders at the Battle of Wittstock in that same year. The overall commander, however, is said by some Swedish historians to have been Johan Banér; but at the time the two commanders had held equal rank: Banér commanding the Swedish Crown Army and Leslie commanding the Army of the Weser. The spectacular victory, however, was largely the work of Leslie and his subordinate, a fellow Scotsman, Lieutenant-General James King, a fact related by Banér himself in his report of the battle to Axel Oxenstierna and the other contemporary reports of the battle.

Leslie was furious with Banér and in his own account of the battle infers there had been a dispute about the tactics for the day. As it was, Leslie was forced to sacrifice many of his veteran troops in the process of saving Banér&#x27;s men from being routed. Leslie intimated to Oxenstierna that he would stand down from Swedish service but was persuaded to remain and restructure the Army of the Weser. However, by 1637, Leslie was in Scotland preparing the way for his final retirement from Swedish service. He cherished his old commander&#x27;s memory to the day of his death, and he kept with particular care a jewel and miniature presented to him by the king.

==Return to Scotland==
===Bishops&#x27; Wars===

In 1638, events in his native country again compelled him to return to Scotland, where he was appointed &quot;Lord General&quot; in command of the Army of the Covenant by the Scottish administration, and as such participated in the Bishops&#x27; Wars. Scottish regiments were generally called into service by the lairds and clan chieftains obliging their tenants with feudal duty or coercion to send their kin into battle. However, support among the Presbyterians of Scotland was widespread and the Covenanters&#x27; army swelled to over 20,000 men. From 1639 they rallied under a flag bearing the motto &quot;For Christ&#x27;s Crown and Covenant&quot;. Most of the officers of the Army of the Covenant were veterans of Swedish service brought home from the continental wars to form Scotland&#x27;s first professional army. This took place after careful negotiations in the Swedish Riksråd (state council) during which Leslie worked behind the scenes to ensure Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna allowed up to 300 officers to be decommissioned along with an unknown number of ordinary soldiers. He was also able to bring from Sweden his arrears of pay in the form of cannon and muskets as &quot;parting gifts&quot; and these were transported for him on Swedish naval vessels. The payment arrangement meant that the Swedes could claim that they were not supporting rebellion in Scotland, only paying off a debt.

One of his first actions was to lead an army of some 6,000 soldiers to Aberdeen to reduce the largely Royalist town. On his departure on 12 April Leslie left the Marquis of Montrose in charge.
Leslie&#x27;s reputation, guile and discretion were frequently noted by contemporary observers including the English officer John Aston and intellectual, Sir Cheney Culpeper, who both commented on his qualities in their writings. His reputation was well earned and he took Edinburgh Castle without the loss of a single man. He had also by now amassed a considerable fortune and was able to live in a manner befitting a commander-in-chief, even when in the field. In the First Bishops&#x27; War, Leslie marched his army to Dunse Law where he encamped and awaited the arrival of the Royalist forces. Rather than fight them when they arrived, Leslie invited the Royalist officers to dinner before allowing them to inspect his army. Having seen they were out-classed by the Army of the Covenant, the Royalists chose to retire rather than to engage Leslie&#x27;s superior forces. In the Second Bishops&#x27; War, Leslie conducted a brilliant campaign in the North of England, overwhelming the Royalists at the Battle of Newburn. From there he took Newcastle with ease putting pressure on the King to come to a treaty with the Scottish Covenanters. Thus followed the treaty of London.

In 1641 King Charles I in reward for his extraordinary military achievements at home and abroad appointed Leslie to the Scottish Privy Council and bestowed upon him, at Holyrood, the titles of Lord Balgonie and Earl of Leven, and made him captain of Edinburgh Castle. His affirmations of loyalty to the crown, which later events caused to be remembered against him, were sincere enough, but the complicated politics of the time made it difficult for Leslie, as lord general of the Scottish army, to maintain consistent policies.

A little later, Leven used his influence in support of a proposal to raise a Scottish army to help the Elector palatine in Germany, but the Ulster massacres gave this force, when raised, a fresh direction and Leven himself accompanied it to Ireland as lord general. He did not remain there long, for the Civil War had begun in England, and negotiations were opened between the English and the Scottish parliaments for mutual armed assistance.

===Solemn League and Covenant===

Leven eventually accepted command of the forces raised for the intervention in England on behalf of the English Parliament. He rose to become a commander of the Covenanter Army between 1644 and 1647 and fought for the Solemn League and Covenant, which bound both the Scottish and English parliaments together against the Royalist forces in the Three Stuart Kingdoms.

In 1644, Leven commanded the Army of the Solemn League and Covenant as it marched to England to take part in the unsuccessful Siege of York, before participating in the Battle of Marston Moor as senior commander of the allied Army of Both Kingdoms which included the two English parliamentary armies led respectively by Ferdinando Fairfax and the Earl of Manchester. Under Leven&#x27;s command these forces inflicted a crushing defeat on the Royalists under Prince Rupert. The allied army then invested and captured York which surrendered within a fortnight. Later in the year Newcastle also fell after a spectacular siege and storm campaign. In 1645 after his English Allies won a victory at Battle of Naseby, he marched to take the Royalist city of Hereford but his siege was unsuccessful against the local commander Barnabas Scudamore. When Charles I surrendered to the Army of the Solemn League and Covenant at Newark in 1646, he was placed under the charge of Leven. As part of the negotiation for the Army of the Solemn League to leave England, Leven transferred the king to his Presbyterian allies unaware that these would soon lose power to the Independents. Nevertheless, Leven remained in control of Northern England and only agreed to relinquish his garrisons there when back-pay owing to his troops had been paid. The final instalment of this came in January 1647 after which Leven marched his army back across the Scottish border.

With the demise of the Army of the Solemn League and Covenant, Leven retired from active military command. Splits within the Scottish Parliament saw the Royalist Engager party led by James, 3rd Marquis Hamilton oust the Argyll radicals. Leven and his subordinate David Leslie, both declined command of this army. Hamilton led an ill-supported army over the border in support of the king. They were soundly defeated by English parliamentary forces at the Battle of Preston in 1648. This led to the return of the Argyll faction in Scotland after the Whiggamore Raid. After the execution of Charles I, Argyll declared his son, Charles II, King of Great Britain and Ireland leading to the Cromwellian invasion of Scotland. The Covenanters were defeated (1650) at the battle of Dunbar.

===Afterward===
In the new war, and in the disastrous campaign of Dunbar, Leven took no part despite officially being Lord General. Actual field command fell to David Leslie who failed to control his infantry and lost the battle in consequence. Leven took only a nominal part, though attempts were afterwards made to hold him responsible. But once more the parliament refused to accept his resignation.

In August 1651 Leven was captured in the town of Alyth by a group of Cromwellian dragoons in an incident known as &#x27;the Onfall of Alyth&#x27;, and was sent to London. He was confined to the Tower of London for some time, until he was released on providing a bond of £20,000, whereupon he retired to Northumberland. Sometime later in London he was arrested for a second time, but negotiations involving Queen Christina of Sweden obtained him his liberty, and he was finally freed from his engagements in 1654.

In one of his final military acts, Leven helped his son-in-law, Colonel William Cranston, to raise troops for Swedish service largely drawn from Scottish prisoners of war. These fought in Poland in the Toruń campaign.

He died in 1661 at Balgonie Castle, Fife, Scotland.

==Family==

Alexander Leslie was married to Agnes Renton (died 29 June 1651, daughter of David Renton of Billie in Berwickshire). They had two sons and five daughters: Gustavus, who apparently died young, Alexander (2nd Lord Balgonie), Barbara, Christian, Anne, Margaret and Mary. Barbara married General Sir John Ruthven (not Patrick Ruthven as often stated). Alexander, his eldest son and namesake, became a colonel in the Swedish Army. In 1636 Lord Balgonie married daughter of John Leslie, Earl of Rothes. Young Leslie later followed his father into service in the Army of the Solemn League and Covenant, commanding Leven&#x27;s lancers and cavalry on the right wing at the battle of Marston Moor. He pre-deceased his father.

==Nursery rhyme and song==

The nursery rhyme &quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot; is allegedly about Sir Alexander Leslie:

The song &quot;General Lesley&#x27;s March&quot; is said to have been sung by Scottish soldiers during the wars of the Covenant in the 1640s, though it is more likely to be a mockery of the Covenanters:

When to the kirk we come,
We&#x27;ll purge it ilka room,

Frae popish relics, and a&#x27; sic innovation,

That a&#x27; the world may see,

There&#x27;s nane in the right but we,
Of the auld Scottish nation.

<doc id="234224" wikidata="Q116150719" url="?curid=234224" title="Praline (nut confection)">
<text>Pralines (; ) are confections containing nuts – usually almonds, pecans and hazelnuts – and sugar. Cream is a common third ingredient.

There are two main types:
* French pralines, a firm combination of almonds or hazelnuts, and caramelized sugar
* American pralines, a softer, creamier combination of syrup and pecans, hazelnuts or almonds with milk or cream, resembling fudge

A &quot;praline cookie&quot; is a chocolate cookie containing ground nuts. Praline is usually used as a filling in chocolates or other sweets.

== Varieties ==
=== European nut pralines ===

Praline may have originally been inspired in France by the cook of Marshal du Plessis-Praslin (1602–1675), with the word &quot;praline&quot; deriving from the name &quot;Praslin&quot;. Early pralines were whole almonds individually coated in caramelized sugar, as opposed to dark nougat, where a sheet of caramelized sugar covers many nuts. Though European colonization of the Western Hemisphere was already underway, chocolate-producing cocoa from there was originally not associated with the term. The European chefs used local nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts.

The powder made by grinding up such caramel-coated nuts is called &quot;pralin&quot;, and is an ingredient in many cakes, pastries, and ice creams. After this powder has been mixed with chocolate, it becomes &quot;praliné&quot; in French, which gave birth to what is known in French as &quot;chocolat praliné&quot;. The word &quot;praliné&quot; is used colloquially in France and Switzerland to refer to these various chocolate-coated mixes (&quot;chocolates&quot; in English). In mainland Europe, the word praline is often used to mean either this nut powder or the chocolate paste made from it, which is widely used to fill chocolates, hence its use in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium to refer to filled chocolates in general. In the United Kingdom, the term can refer either to praline (the filling for chocolates) or, less commonly, to the original whole-nut pralines.

=== American cream-based pralines ===
French settlers brought the recipe to Louisiana, where both sugar cane and pecan trees were plentiful. In 19th century New Orleans, people began substituting pecans for almonds, added cream to thicken the confection, and thus created what became known throughout the American South as the praline.

Pralines have a creamy consistency, similar to fudge. They are usually made by combining sugar (often brown), butter, cream or buttermilk, and pecans in a pot over medium-high heat, and stirring constantly until most of the water has evaporated and it has reached a thick texture with a brown color. This is then usually dropped by spoonfuls onto wax paper or a sheet of aluminum foil greased with butter, and left to cool.
&quot;Pralines and Cream&quot; is a common ice cream flavor in the United States and Canada. In New Orleans, Acadiana, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, pralines are sometimes called &quot;pecan candy&quot;.

<text>Mansell Street is a street in Central London, which is part of the London Inner Ring Road. For most of its length from the north, this street marks the boundary between the City of London and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. However, the southernmost part is entirely in Tower Hamlets.

==History==

Mansell Street was named after a relative of William Leman, whose great-uncle, John Leman had bought Goodman&#x27;s Fields earlier in the seventeenth century. Alie Street ran along the western side, with Leman Street to the east, Prescot Street to the south, and Alie Street to the North. These new streets were developed in the late seventeenth century while Goodman&#x27;s Fields was used as a tenterground.

== Mansell Street estate==
This estate was built in 1977 by the Guinness Trust. It consists of 194 homes and in 2019 there were plans for its redevelopment.

<doc id="234226" wikidata="Q244156" url="?curid=234226" title="Traffic congestion">
<text>Traffic congestion is a condition in transport that is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing. Traffic congestion on urban road networks has increased substantially since the 1950s, resulting in many of the roads becoming obsolete. When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the traffic stream, this results in congestion. While congestion is a possibility for any mode of transportation, this article will focus on automobile congestion on public roads. Mathematically, traffic is modeled as a flow through a fixed point on the route, analogously to fluid dynamics.

As demand approaches the capacity of a road (or of the intersections along the road), extreme traffic congestion sets in. When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is known as a traffic jam or (informally) a traffic snarl-up or a tailback. Drivers can become frustrated and engage in road rage. Drivers and driver-focused road planning departments commonly propose to alleviate congestion by adding another lane to the road. This is ineffective: increasing road capacity induces more demand for driving.

==Causes==

Traffic congestion occurs when a volume of traffic generates demand for space greater than the available street capacity; this point is commonly termed saturation. Several specific circumstances can cause or aggravate congestion; most of them reduce the capacity of a road at a given point or over a certain length, or increase the number of vehicles required for a given volume of people or goods. About half of U.S. traffic congestion is recurring, and is attributed to sheer volume of traffic; most of the rest is attributed to traffic incidents, road work and weather events. In terms of traffic operation, rainfall reduces traffic capacity and operating speeds, thereby resulting in greater congestion and road network productivity loss.

Individual incidents such as crashes or even a single car braking heavily in a previously smooth flow may cause ripple effects, a cascading failure, which then spread out and create a sustained traffic jam when, otherwise, the normal flow might have continued for some time longer.

===Separation of work and residential areas===
People often work and live in different parts of the city. Many workplaces are located in a central business district away from residential areas, resulting in workers commuting. According to a 2011 report published by the United States Census Bureau, a total of 132.3 million people in the United States commute between their work and residential areas daily.

===Movement to obtain or provide goods and services===

People may need to move about within the city to obtain goods and services, for instance to purchase goods or attend classes in a different part of the city. Brussels, a Belgian city with a strong service economy, has one of the worst traffic congestion in the world, wasting 74 hours in traffic in 2014.

===Economic theories===
Congested roads can be seen as an example of the tragedy of the commons. Because roads in most places are free at the point of usage, there is little financial incentive for drivers not to over-use them, up to the point where traffic collapses into a jam, when demand becomes limited by opportunity cost. Privatization of highways and road pricing have both been proposed as measures that may reduce congestion through economic incentives and disincentives . Congestion can also happen due to non-recurring highway incidents, such as a crash or roadworks, which may reduce the road&#x27;s capacity below normal levels.

Economist Anthony Downs argues that rush hour traffic congestion is inevitable because of the benefits of having a relatively standard work day . In a capitalist economy, goods can be allocated either by pricing (ability to pay) or by queueing (first-come first-served); congestion is an example of the latter. Instead of the traditional solution of making the &quot;pipe&quot; large enough to accommodate the total demand for peak-hour vehicle travel (a supply-side solution), either by widening roadways or increasing &quot;flow pressure&quot; via automated highway systems, Downs advocates greater use of road pricing to reduce congestion (a demand-side solution, effectively rationing demand), in turn putting the revenues generated therefrom into public transportation projects.

A 2011 study in &quot;The American Economic Review&quot; indicates that there may be a &quot;fundamental law of road congestion.&quot; The researchers, from the University of Toronto and the London School of Economics, analyzed data from the U.S. Highway Performance and Monitoring System for 1983, 1993 and 2003, as well as information on population, employment, geography, transit, and political factors. They determined that the number of vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) increases in direct proportion to the available lane-kilometers of roadways. The implication is that building new roads and widening existing ones only results in additional traffic that continues to rise until peak congestion returns to the previous level.
==Classification and modeling==
Qualitative classification of traffic is often done in the form of a six-letter A–F level of service (LOS) scale defined in the Highway Capacity Manual, a US document used (or used as a basis for national guidelines) worldwide. While this system generally uses delay as the basis for its measurements, the particular measurements and statistical methods vary depending on the facility being described. For instance, while the percent time spent following a slower-moving vehicle figures into the LOS for a rural two-lane road, the LOS at an urban intersection incorporates such measurements as the number of drivers forced to wait through more than one signal cycle.

Another classification schema of traffic congestion is associated with some common spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion found in measured traffic data. Common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion are those features, which are qualitatively the same for different highways in different countries measured during years of traffic observations. Common features of traffic congestion are independent on weather, road conditions and road infrastructure, vehicular technology, driver characteristics, day time, etc. Examples of common features of traffic congestion are the features [J] and [S] for, respectively, the &quot;wide moving jam&quot; and &quot;synchronized flow&quot; traffic phases found in Boris Kerner&#x27;s three-phase traffic theory. The common features of traffic congestion can be reconstructed in space and time with the use of the ASDA and FOTO models.


Some traffic engineers have attempted to apply the rules of fluid dynamics to traffic flow, likening it to the flow of a fluid in a pipe. Congestion simulations and real-time observations have shown that in heavy but free flowing traffic, jams can arise spontaneously, triggered by minor events (&quot;butterfly effects&quot;), such as an abrupt steering maneuver by a single motorist. Traffic scientists liken such a situation to the sudden freezing of supercooled fluid.

Because of the poor correlation of theoretical models to actual observed traffic flows, transportation planners and highway engineers attempt to forecast traffic flow using empirical models. Their working traffic models typically use a combination of macro-, micro- and mesoscopic features, and may add matrix entropy effects, by &quot;platooning&quot; groups of vehicles and by randomizing the flow patterns within individual segments of the network. These models are then typically calibrated by measuring actual traffic flows on the links in the network, and the baseline flows are adjusted accordingly.

A team of MIT mathematicians has developed a model that describes the formation of &quot;phantom jams&quot;, in which small disturbances (a driver hitting the brake too hard, or getting too close to another car) in heavy traffic can become amplified into a full-blown, self-sustaining traffic jam. Key to the study is the realization that the mathematics of such jams, which the researchers call &quot;jamitons&quot;, are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions, says Aslan Kasimov, lecturer in MIT&#x27;s Department of Mathematics. That discovery enabled the team to solve traffic-jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s.

==Negative impacts==

Traffic congestion has a number of negative effects:
* Wasting time of motorists and passengers (&quot;opportunity cost&quot;). As a non-productive activity for most people, congestion reduces regional economic health.
* Delays, which may result in late arrival for employment, meetings, and education, resulting in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses.
* Inability to forecast travel time accurately, leading to drivers allocating more time to travel &quot;just in case&quot;, and less time on productive activities.
* Wasted fuel increasing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions owing to increased idling, acceleration and braking.
* Wear and tear on vehicles as a result of idling in traffic and frequent acceleration and braking, leading to more frequent repairs and replacements.
* Stressed and frustrated motorists, encouraging road rage and reduced health of motorists
* Emergencies: blocked traffic may interfere with the passage of emergency vehicles traveling to their destinations where they are urgently needed.
* Spillover effect from congested main arteries to secondary roads and side streets as alternative routes are attempted (&#x27;rat running&#x27;), which may affect neighborhood amenity and real estate prices.
* Higher chance of collisions due to tight spacing and constant stopping-and-going.

===Road rage===
Road rage is aggressive or angry behavior by a driver of an automobile or other motor vehicle. Such behavior might include rude gestures, verbal insults, deliberately driving in an unsafe or threatening manner, or making threats. Road rage can lead to altercations, assaults, and collisions which result in injuries and even deaths. It can be thought of as an extreme case of aggressive driving.The term originated in the United States in 1987–1988 (specifically, from Newscasters at KTLA, a local television station), when a rash of freeway shootings occurred on the 405, 110 and 10 freeways in Los Angeles, California. These shooting sprees even spawned a response from the AAA Motor Club to its members on how to respond to drivers with road rage or aggressive maneuvers and gestures.

=== Economic loss ===

==Positive effects==

Congestion has the benefit of encouraging motorists to retime their trips so that expensive road space is in full use for more hours per day. It may also encourage travellers to pick alternate modes with a lower environmental impact, such as public transport or bicycles.

It has been argued that traffic congestion, by reducing road speeds in cities, could reduce the frequency and severity of road crashes. More recent research suggests that a U-shaped curve exists between the number of accidents and the flow of traffic, implying that more accidents happen not only at high congestion levels, but also when there are very few vehicles on the road.

==Countermeasures==
===Improving Road infrastructure===


* Increasing road capacity is standard response to congestion, perhaps by widening an existing road or adding a new road, bridge or tunnel. However, this has been shown to result in attracting more traffic, otherwise known as induced demand. The result can be greater congestion on the expanded artery itself or on auxiliary roads. In a similar vein, Braess&#x27;s paradox shows that adding road capacity might make congestion worse, even if demand does not increase. In his paper, &quot;The Law of Peak Hour Express Way Congestion&quot;, published in 1962, Anthony Downs formulated this phenomenon as a &quot;law&quot;: “on urban commuter expressways, peak-hour traffic congestion rises to meet maximum capacity.”
* Junction improvements
** Grade separation, using bridges (or, less often, tunnels) freeing movements from having to stop for other crossing movements
** Ramp signaling, &#x27;drip-feeding&#x27; merging traffic via traffic signals onto a congested motorway-type roadway
** Reducing junctions
*** Local-express lanes, providing through lanes that bypass junction on-ramp and off-ramp zones
*** Limited-access road, roads that limit the type and amounts of driveways along their lengths
* Reversible lanes, where certain sections of highway operate in the opposite direction on different times of the day(s) of the week, to match asymmetric demand. These pose a potential for collisions, if drivers do not notice the change in direction indicators. This may be controlled by variable-message signs or by movable physical separation
* Separate lanes for specific user groups (usually with the goal of higher people throughput with fewer vehicles)
** Bus lanes as part of a busway system
** Express toll lanes
** HOV lanes, for vehicles with at least three (sometimes at least two) riders, intended to encourage carpooling
*** Slugging, impromptu carpooling at HOV access points, on a hitchhiking or payment basis
*** Market-based carpooling with pre-negotiated financial incentives for the driver

===Urban planning and design===
City planning and urban design practices can have a huge impact on levels of future traffic congestion, though they are of limited relevance for short-term change.
* Grid plans including fused grid road network geometry, rather than tree-like network topology which branches into cul-de-sacs (which reduce local traffic, but increase total distances driven and discourage walking by reducing connectivity). This avoids concentration of traffic on a small number of arterial roads and allows more trips to be made without a car.
* Zoning laws that encourage mixed-use development, which reduces distances between residential, commercial, retail, and recreational destinations and encourage cycling and walking. Cycling modal share is strongly associated with the availability of local cycling infrastructure.
* Carfree cities, car-light cities, and eco-cities designed to eliminate the need to travel by car for most inhabitants.
* Transit-oriented development are residential and commercial areas designed to maximize access to public transport by providing a transit station or stop (train station, metro station, tram stop, or bus stop).

===Supply and demand===

Congestion can be reduced by either increasing road capacity (supply), or by reducing traffic (demand). Capacity can be increased in a number of ways, but needs to take account of latent demand otherwise it may be used more strongly than anticipated. Critics of the approach of adding capacity have compared it to &quot;fighting obesity by letting out your belt&quot; (inducing demand that did not exist before). For example, when new lanes are created, households with a second car that used to be parked most of the time may begin to use this second car for commuting. Reducing road capacity has in turn been attacked as removing free choice as well as increasing travel costs and times, placing an especially high burden on the low income residents who must commute to work.

Increased supply can include:
* Adding more capacity at bottlenecks (such as by adding more lanes at the expense of hard shoulders or safety zones, or by removing local obstacles like bridge supports and widening tunnels)
* Adding more capacity over the whole of a route (generally by adding more lanes)
* Creating new routes
* Traffic management improvements (see separate section below)

Reduction of demand can include:
* Parking restrictions, making motor vehicle use less attractive by increasing the monetary and non-monetary costs of parking, introducing greater competition for limited city or road space. Most transport planning experts agree that free parking distorts the market in favor of car travel, exacerbating congestion.
* Park and ride facilities allowing parking at a distance and allowing continuation by public transport or ride sharing. Park-and-ride car parks are commonly found at metro stations, freeway entrances in suburban areas, and at the edge of smaller cities.
* Reduction of road capacity to force traffic onto other travel modes. Methods include traffic calming and the shared space concept.
* Road pricing, charging money for access onto a road/specific area at certain times, congestion levels or for certain road users
** &quot;Cap and trade&quot;, in which only licensed cars are allowed on the roads. A limited quota of car licenses are issued each year and traded in a free market fashion. This guarantees that the number of cars does not exceed road capacity while avoiding the negative effects of shortages normally associated with quotas. However, since demand for cars tends to be inelastic, the result are exorbitant purchase prices for the licenses, pricing out the lower levels of society, as seen Singapore&#x27;s Certificate of Entitlement scheme.
** Congestion pricing, including:
*** Congestion zone charges, in which entry via car to a certain area, such as the inner part of a city, requires payment. Enforcement may be a physical boundary (e.g., toll stations) or it may be virtual, via spot checks or cameras. Major examples include congestion pricing in New York City; Singapore&#x27;s electronic road pricing; the London congestion charge; and the Stockholm congestion tax.
*** Fixed (the same at all times of day), variable (higher at peak times), or dynamic (higher during actual congestion) toll roads, toll bridges, toll tunnels, and toll lanes
* Managed lanes
** High-occupancy toll lanes
** Reversible lanes
** High-occupancy vehicle lanes
** Bus lanes
** Truck lane restrictions and climbing lanes, to allow faster vehicles to move unimpeded
** Allowing driving on highway shoulders at peak times
* Road space rationing, where regulatory restrictions prevent certain types of vehicles from driving under certain circumstances or in certain areas.
** Number plate restrictions based on days of the week, as practiced in several large cities in the world, such as Athens, Mexico City, Manila, and São Paulo. In effect, such cities are banning a different part of the automobile fleet from roads each day of the week. Mainly introduced to combat smog, these measures also reduce congestion. A weakness of this method is that richer drivers can purchase a second or third car to circumvent the ban.
** Permits, where only certain types of vehicles (such as residents) are permitted to enter a certain area, and other types (such as through-traffic) are banned. For example, Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, has proposed to impose a complete ban on motor vehicles in the city&#x27;s inner districts, with exemptions only for residents, businesses, and the disabled.

* Policy approaches, which usually attempt to provide either strategic alternatives or which encourage greater usage of existing alternatives through promotion, subsidies or restrictions.
** Incentives to use public transport, increasing modal shares. This can be achieved through infrastructure investment, subsidies, transport integration, pricing strategies that decrease the marginal cost/fixed cost ratios, improved timetabling and greater priority for buses to reduce journey time e.g. bus lanes or bus rapid transit .
** Cycling promotion through legislation, cycle facilities, subsidies, and awareness campaigns. The Netherlands has been pursuing cycle friendly policies for decades, and around a quarter of their commuting is done by bicycle.
** Promotion of more flexible work place practices. For example, a flexible workplaces pilot was undertaken in Brisbane, Australia during 2009 to test the applicability of a voluntary travel behavior change program to achieve transport system outcomes, particularly as they related to managing congestion, either through mode shift or peak spreading. During the one-month Pilot, amongst almost 900 Brisbane CBD workers across 20 private and public sector organizations, shifts of more than 30% out of the morning and afternoon peak travel was recorded.
** Remote work encouraged through legislation and subsidies.
** Online shopping promotion, potentially with automated delivery booths helping to solve the last mile problem and reduce shopping trips made by car.

===Traffic management===

Use of so-called intelligent transportation systems, which guide traffic:
* Traffic reporting, via radio, GPS and mobile apps, to advise road users
* Variable message signs installed along the roadway, to advise road users
* Navigation systems, possibly linked up to automatic traffic reporting
* Traffic counters permanently installed, to provide real-time traffic counts
* Automated highway systems, a future idea which could reduce the safe interval between cars (required for braking in emergencies) and increase highway capacity by as much as 100% while increasing travel speeds
* Parking guidance and information systems providing dynamic advice to motorists about free parking
* Active traffic management system opens up UK motorway hard shoulder as an extra traffic lane; it uses CCTV and VMS to control and monitor the traffic&#x27;s use of the extra lane.

===Other associated===

* School opening times arranged to avoid rush hour traffic (in some countries, private car school pickup and drop-off traffic are substantial percentages of peak hour traffic).
* Considerate driving behavior promotion and enforcement. Driving practices such as tailgating, frequent lane changes, and impeding the flow of traffic can reduce a road&#x27;s capacity and exacerbate jams. In some countries signs are placed on highways to raise awareness, while others have introduced legislation against inconsiderate driving.
* Visual barriers to prevent drivers from slowing down out of curiosity (often called &quot;rubbernecking&quot; in the United States). This often includes crashes, with traffic slowing down even on roadsides physically separated from the crash location. This also tends to occur at construction sites, which is why some countries have introduced rules that motorway construction has to occur behind visual barrier
* Speed limit reductions, as practiced on the M25 motorway in London. With lower speeds allowing cars to drive closer together, this increases the capacity of a road. Note that this measure is only effective if the interval between cars is reduced, not the distance itself. Low intervals are generally only safe at low speeds.
* Lane splitting/filtering, in which some jurisdictions allow motorcycles, scooters and bicycles to travel in the space between cars, buses, and trucks.
* Reduction of road freight avoiding problems such as double parking with innovative solutions including cargo bicycles and Gothenburg&#x27;s Stadsleveransens.
* Reducing the quantity of cars that are on the road, i.e. through proof-of-parking requirements, circulation plans, corporate car sharing, bans on on-street parking or by increasing the costs of car ownership

==By country==

===Australia===
Traffic during peak hours in major Australian cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, is usually very congested and can cause considerable delay for motorists. Australians rely mainly on radio and television to obtain current traffic information. GPS, webcams, and online resources are increasingly being used to monitor and relay traffic conditions to motorists. Based on a survey in 2024, Brisbane is the most congested cities in Australia and 10th in the world, with drivers averagely losing 84 hours throughout the year.

===Bangladesh===

Traffic jams have become intolerable in Dhaka. Some other major reasons are the total absence of a rapid transit system; the lack of an integrated urban planning scheme for over 30 years; poorly maintained road surfaces, with potholes rapidly eroded further by frequent flooding and poor or non-existent drainage; haphazard stopping and parking; poor driving standards; total lack of alternative routes, with several narrow and (nominally) one-way roads.

===Brazil===

According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, São Paulo has the world&#x27;s worst daily traffic jams. Based on reports from the &quot;Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego&quot;, the city&#x27;s traffic management agency, the historical congestion record was set on May 23, 2014, with of cumulative queues around the city during the evening rush hour. The previous record occurred on November 14, 2013, with of cumulative queues.

Despite implementation since 1997 of road space rationing by the last digit of the plate number during rush hours every weekday, traffic in this 20-million-strong city still experiences severe congestion. According to experts, this is due to the accelerated rate of motorization occurring since 2003 and the limited capacity of public transport. In São Paulo, traffic is growing at a rate of 7.5% per year, with almost 1,000 new cars bought in the city every day. The subway has only of lines, though 35 further kilometers are under construction or planned by 2010. Every day, many citizens spend between three up to four hours behind the wheel. In order to mitigate the aggravating congestion problem, since June 30, 2008, the road space rationing program was expanded to include and restrict trucks and light commercial vehicles.

===Canada===
According to the Toronto Board of Trade, in 2010, Toronto is ranked as the most congested city of 19 surveyed cities, with an average commute time of 80 minutes.

===China===

The Chinese city of Beijing started a license plate rationing since the 2008 Summer Olympics whereby each car is banned from the urban core one workday per week, depending on the last digit of its license plate. As of 2016, 11 major Chinese cities have implemented similar policies. Towards the end of 2010, Beijing announced a series of drastic measures to tackle the city&#x27;s chronic traffic congestion, such as limiting the number of new plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month, barring vehicles with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hours and expanding its subway system. The government aims to cap the number of locally registered cars in Beijing to below 6.3 million by the end of 2020. In addition, more than nine major Chinese cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou started limiting the number of new plates issued to passenger cars in an attempt to curb the growth of car ownership. In response to the increased demand to public transit caused by these policies, aggressive programs to rapidly expand public transport systems in many Chinese cities are currently underway.

A unique Chinese phenomenon of severe traffic congestion occurs during Chunyun Period or Spring Festival travel season. It is a long-held tradition for most Chinese people to reunite with their families during Chinese New Year. People return to their hometown to have a reunion dinner with their families on Chinese New Year. It has been described as the largest annual human migration in the world. Since the economic boom and rapid urbanization of China since the late 1970s, many people work and study a considerable distance from their hometowns. Traffic flow is typically directional, with large amounts of the population working in more developed coastal provinces needing travel to their hometowns in the less developed interior. The process reverses near the end of Chunyun. With almost 3 billion trips made in 40 days of the 2016 Chunyun Period, the Chinese intercity transportation network is extremely strained during this period.

The August 2010 China National Highway 110 traffic jam in Hebei province caught media attention for its severity, stretching more than from August 14 to 26, including at least 11 days of total gridlock. The event was caused by a combination of road works and thousands of coal trucks from Inner Mongolia&#x27;s coalfields that travel daily to Beijing. The New York Times has called this event the &quot;Great Chinese Gridlock of 2010.&quot; The congestion is regarded as the worst in history by duration, and is one of the longest in length after the long Lyon-Paris traffic jam in France on February 16, 1980.

Recently, in Hangzhou City Brain has become active, reducing traffic congestion somewhat.

A 2021 study of subway constructions in China found that in the first year of a new subway line, road congestion declined.

===Greece===

Since the 70s, the traffic on the streets of Athens has increased dramatically, with the existing road network unable to serve the ever-increasing demand. In addition, it has also caused an environmental burden, such as the photochemical smog. To deal with it, the Daktylios has been enforced.

===India===
The number of vehicles in India is quickly increasing as a growing middle class can now afford to buy cars. India&#x27;s road conditions have not kept up with the exponential growth in number of vehicles.

Various causes for this include:
* Private encroachments
* Non cooperation among drivers
* Unscientific road design
* Lack of free ways/exit ways where local roads and main roads intersect
* Lack of demarcated footpaths
* Lack of bus bays
* Lack of cycle tracks
* Lack of coordination among various government departments (e.g. digging of roads by telecom/water department and leaving it open)

===Indonesia===

According to a 2015 study by motor oil company Castrol, Jakarta is found to be the worst city in the world for traffic congestion. Relying on information from TomTom navigation devices in 78 countries, the index found that drivers are stopping and starting their cars 33,240 times per year on the road. After Jakarta, the worst cities for traffic are Istanbul, Mexico City, Surabaya, and St. Petersburg.

Daily congestion in Jakarta is not a recent problem. The expansion of commercial area without road expansion shows worsening daily congestion even in main roads such as Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, Jalan M.H. Thamrin, and Jalan Gajah Mada in the mid-1970s.

In 2016, 22 people died as a result of traffic congestion in Java. They were among those stuck in a three-day traffic jam at a toll exit in Brebes, Central Java called Brebes Exit or &#x27;Brexit&#x27;. The traffic block stretched for 21 km here and thousands of cars clogged the highway. Many people died because of carbon monoxide poisoning, fatigue or heat.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand has followed strongly car-oriented transport policies since after World War II (especially in Auckland, where one third of the country&#x27;s population lives, is New Zealand&#x27;s most traffic congested city, and has been labeled worse than New York for traffic congestion with commuters sitting in traffic congestion for 95 hours per year), and currently has one of the highest car-ownership rates per capita in the world, after the United States. Traffic congestion in New Zealand is increasing with drivers on New Zealand&#x27;s motorways reported to be struggling to exceed 20 km/h on an average commute, sometimes crawling along at 8 km/h for more than half an hour.

===Philippines===

According to a survey by Waze, traffic congestion in Metro Manila is called the &quot;worst&quot; in the world, after Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Jakarta. It is worsened by violations of traffic laws, like illegal parking, loading and unloading, beating the red light, and wrong-way driving. Traffic congestion in Metro Manila is caused by the large number of registered vehicles, lack of roads, and overpopulation, especially in the cities of Manila and Caloocan, as well as the municipality of Pateros.

Traffic caused losses of ₱137,500,000,000 on the economy in 2011, and unbuilt roads and railway projects also causes worsening congestion. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) feared that daily economic losses will reach Php 6,000,000,000 by 2030 if traffic congestion cannot be controlled.

===Turkey===

In recent years, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has made huge investments on intelligent transportation systems and public transportation. Despite that, traffic is a significant problem in Istanbul.
Istanbul has chosen the second most congested and the most sudden-stopping traffic in the world. Travel times in Turkey&#x27;s largest city take on average 55 percent longer than they should, even in relatively less busy hours.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom the inevitability of congestion in some urban road networks has been officially recognized since the Department for Transport set down policies based on the report &quot;Traffic in Towns&quot; in 1963:

Even when everything that it is possibly to do by way of building new roads and expanding public transport has been done, there would still be, in the absence of deliberate limitation, more cars trying to move into, or within our cities than could possibly be accommodated.

The Department for Transport sees growing congestion as one of the most serious transport problems facing the UK. On December 1, 2006, Rod Eddington published a UK government-sponsored report into the future of Britain&#x27;s transport infrastructure. The Eddington Transport Study set out the case for action to improve road and rail networks, as a &quot;crucial enabler of sustained productivity and competitiveness&quot;. Eddington has estimated that congestion may cost the economy of England £22 bn a year in lost time by 2025. He warned that roads were in serious danger of becoming so congested that the economy would suffer. At the launch of the report Eddington told journalists and transport industry representatives introducing road pricing to encourage drivers to drive less was an &quot;economic no-brainer&quot;. There was, he said &quot;no attractive alternative&quot;. It would allegedly cut congestion by half by 2025, and bring benefits to the British economy totaling £28 bn a year.

A congestion charge for driving in central London was introduced in 2003. In 2013, ten years later, Transport for London reported that the scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometers in London. Despite these gains, traffic speeds in central London became progressively slower.

===United States===


The Texas Transportation Institute estimated that, in 2000, the 75 largest metropolitan areas experienced 3.6 billion vehicle-hours of delay, resulting in 5.7 billion U.S. gallons (21.6 billion liters) in wasted fuel and $67.5 billion in lost productivity, or about 0.7% of the nation&#x27;s GDP. It also estimated that the annual cost of congestion for each driver was approximately $1,000 in very large cities and $200 in small cities. Traffic congestion is increasing in major cities and delays are becoming more frequent in smaller cities and rural areas.

30% of traffic is cars looking for parking.

According to traffic analysis firm INRIX in 2019, the top 31 worst US traffic congested cities (measured in average hours wasted per vehicle for the year) were:

The most congested highway in the United States, according to a 2010 study of freight congestion (truck speed and travel time), is Chicago&#x27;s Interstate 290 at the Circle Interchange. The average truck speed was just .

<text>Count Hans Christoff von Königsmarck, of Tjust (12 December 1605 – 8 March 1663) was a German soldier who commanded Sweden&#x27;s legendary flying column, a force which played a key role in the Swedish military strategy in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

== Early life ==
He was born in Kötzlin, Altmark as the son of Konrad von Königsmarck (1570-1620) and his wife, Beata Beatrix Elisabeth von Blumenthal (1580-1621).

== Biography ==
After serving as a page on the court of Prince Frederick Ulrich of Wolfenbüttel, he entered Imperial military service in 1620. After the dissolution of Albrecht von Wallenstein&#x27;s troops and Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; intervention, Königsmarck offered his services to the Swedish King. By 1635 he commanded his own regiment. He was appointed Major General in 1640, Governor-General of Bremen-Verden in 1645, Privy Councilor in 1651 and Field Marshal in 1655. He is best known for the Siege of Prague between 25 June and 1 November 1648, where he managed to capture and loot the left-bank of Prague but failed to take the Old Town until fighting ended with news of the Peace of Westphalia.

During the Second Northern War, Königsmarck was captured on a sea passage to the Polish front by Danzigian ships and held prisoner at Weichselmünde until the Treaty of Oliva 1660.

In 1655 Königsmarck erected a castle in Lieth and named it after his wife Agathe von Leesten. The name of the castle, Agathenburg, also became the toponym of the village Lieth. Their children were:
* Otto Wilhelm von Königsmarck
* Conrad or Kurt Christoph von Königsmarck, whose children were:
** Karl Johann von Königsmarck
** Maria Aurora von Königsmarck.
** Amalia Wilhelmina von Königsmarck
** Philip Christoph von Königsmarck
* Beata Elisabet von Königsmarck
He died, aged 57, in Stockholm.

<text>Count Gustaf Adolf Levenhaupt (aka &quot;Löwenhaupt&quot;; 1619–1656) was a Swedish soldier and statesman.

He was appointed Major General in 1645, Privy Councilor in 1650, General in 1651, Field Marshal, in 1655 and Governor General of Riga, in 1656. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) he commanded troops at the Battle of Breitenfeld (First Battle of Leipzig), in 1642.

Queen Christina of Sweden promised him the Himmelpforten Convent with all its revenues, and on 30 July/ 9 August 1651O.S./N.S. he was invested with the convent as a fief heritable in the male line (Mannlehen). In the course of the Great Reduction of 1680 in the following year the general government of Swedish Bremen-Verden revoked the enfeoffment to the Lewenhaupt/Löwenhaupt counts, so that Lewenhaupt&#x27;s son Gustaf Mauritz (1651–1700) lost Himmelpforten again to the Swedish crown.

<text>Lars Kagg (1 May 1595 – 19 November 1661) was a Swedish count and military officer. He was a political ally of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, a member of the Privy Council of Sweden and Field Marshal during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Kagg was born at the Kiellstorp estate in Örslösa parish in Skaraborg, now Västra Götaland County. He was the son of Chamberlain Nils Mathisson Kagg. In 1609, at the age of fourteen, he was taken to the court of King Charles IX of Sweden, where he formed a lifelong relationship with Crown Prince Gustav Adolph.

In 1626, he became deputy governor of Narva and Ivangorod in Swedish Ingria. In 1628, he became colonel of in the Jönköping infantry regiment. In 1631, he became commander in Brandenburg an der Havel and Spandau. In 1632, he became governor of the city of Magdeburg. He was made Lord High Constable of Sweden in 1660.

In 1647, Kagg acquired Kaggeholms gård, an estate on the island of Helgö situated in Lake Mälaren, today the site of Kaggeholm Castle (&quot;Kaggeholms slott&quot;).

<text>Leach&#x27;s storm petrel or Leach&#x27;s petrel (Hydrobates leucorhous) is a small seabird of the tubenose order. It is named after the British zoologist William Elford Leach. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek. &quot;Hydrobates&quot; is from &quot;hydōr&quot; &quot;water&quot;, and &quot;batēs&quot; &quot;walker&quot;, and &quot;leucorhous&quot; is from &quot;leukos&quot;, &quot;white&quot; and &quot;orrhos&quot;, &quot;rump&quot;. It was formerly defined in the genus &quot;Oceanodroma&quot; before that genus was synonymized with &quot;Hydrobates&quot;.

It breeds on inaccessible islands in the colder northern areas of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It nests in colonies close to the sea in well concealed areas such as rock crevices, shallow burrows, or even logs. It lays a single white egg, which often has a faint ring of purple spots at the large end. This storm petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls and skuas, and even avoids coming to land on clear, moonlit nights. The largest colony of Leach&#x27;s storm petrels can be found on Baccalieu Island off eastern Canada, an ecological reserve with ~1.95 million pairs of the birds at last estimate in 2013.

==Description==
Leach&#x27;s petrel, known in some rural areas (particularly in Newfoundland) as Mother Carey&#x27;s chicks, Carey chicks, or Careys, is a small bird at 18–21 cm in length with a 43– to 48-cm wingspan. Like many other storm petrels, it has all-dark plumage and usually a white rump. However, dark-rumped individuals exist on the west coast of North America; they are very rare north of southern California, but the percentage increases suddenly on the United States-Mexico border, where 90-100% of breeding birds are dark-rumped. In Europe, it can be readily distinguished from the European storm petrel and Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel by its larger size, forked tail, different rump pattern, and flight behavior. Identification in the Americas, however, proves more difficult. On the Atlantic Coast, separating this species from band-rumped storm petrels is difficult; identification involves characteristics such as the extent of white on the rump and flight pattern. Discerning this species from others is arguably hardest on the Pacific Coast, where the dark-rumped form can be confused with at least three other all-dark storm petrel species. Here, identification involves close attention to wingbeats and overall color. It has a fluttering flight, and patters on the water as it picks planktonic food items from the ocean surface. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow.

==Subspecies==
* &quot;H. l. leucorhous&quot; — — coasts of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic
* &quot;H. l. chapmani&quot; — — Coronados and San Benito Island (Mexico)

==Distribution and habitat==
It is strictly pelagic outside the breeding season, and this, together with its remote breeding sites, makes Leach&#x27;s petrel a difficult bird to see from land. Only in storms might this species be pushed into headlands. Unlike the European storm petrel, it does not follow ships. In Europe, the best chance of seeing this species is in September in Liverpool Bay between north Wales and England. Strong north-westerlies funnel migrating Leach&#x27;s petrels into this bay. British ornithologists Robert Atkinson and John Ainslie observed the communities of Leach&#x27;s petrel on the remote Scottish islands of North Rona between 16 July and 12 August 1936, and on Sula Sgeir between 3 and 4 August 1939. The bird was first photographed at the nest in 1958, on Eilean Mor, one of the Flannan Isles off the west coast of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, by Jo Moran.

==Ecology==
Lifespan for this bird is unusually long for a bird of such small size, with an average of 25 years and a maximum recorded lifespan of 38+ years (a bird banded between 1979 and 1982 recaptured in 2019 still healthy). In 2003, Haussmann &quot;et al.&quot; found that the bird&#x27;s telomeres lengthen with age, the only known example to date of such a phenomenon. However, this phenomenon likely also occurs in other members of the Procellariiformes, which all have a rather long lifespan compared to their size.
They feed primarily on plankton, including euphausiids, copepods, and a form of amphipod that is parasitic to jellyfish gonadal pouches. They also feed to a large extent on myctophids (lantern fish), which only occur at the surface at night in water over the continental slope. Individuals have been observed to feed at distances up to 1000 km from their breeding colony. A breeding individual stores energy-rich lipids in a sac anterior to its stomach, which is used to either sustain itself while incubating its single egg, to feed its chick, or as a defensive mechanism when caught by a predator, as do many other Procellariformes. Some evidence shows that parents feed their chicks different prey species from what they consume themselves. Parent birds also accidentally feed their chicks plastic debris, which they mistake for food items floating on the surface of the ocean. Chicks grow to a prefledging weight almost double that of when they actually fledge from the burrow in late September. During their migration, they travel to waters associated with the North Equatorial Current, or to waters associated with the Benguela Current. Fall storms can cause these young fledging individuals to wreck on the mainland.

<text>Graham&#x27;s number is an immense number that arose as an upper bound on the answer of a problem in the mathematical field of Ramsey theory. It is much larger than many other large numbers such as Skewes&#x27;s number and Moser&#x27;s number, both of which are in turn much larger than a googolplex. As with these, it is so large that the observable universe is far too small to contain an ordinary digital representation of Graham&#x27;s number, assuming that each digit occupies one Planck volume, possibly the smallest measurable space. But even the number of digits in this digital representation of Graham&#x27;s number would itself be a number so large that its digital representation cannot be represented in the observable universe. Nor even can the number of digits of &quot;that&quot; number—and so forth, for a number of times far exceeding the total number of Planck volumes in the observable universe. Thus Graham&#x27;s number cannot be expressed even by physical universe-scale power towers of the form formula_1, even though Graham&#x27;s number is indeed a power of 3.

However, Graham&#x27;s number can be explicitly given by computable recursive formulas using Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation or equivalent, as was done by Ronald Graham, the number&#x27;s namesake. As there is a recursive formula to define it, it is much smaller than typical busy beaver numbers, the sequence of which grows faster than any computable sequence. Though too large to ever be computed in full, the sequence of digits of Graham&#x27;s number can be computed explicitly via simple algorithms; the last 13 digits are ...7262464195387. Using Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation, Graham&#x27;s number is formula_2, where
formula_3

Graham&#x27;s number was used by Graham in conversations with popular science writer Martin Gardner as a simplified explanation of the upper bounds of the problem he was working on. In 1977, Gardner described the number in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, introducing it to the general public. At the time of its introduction, it was the largest specific positive integer ever to have been used in a published mathematical proof. The number was described in the 1980 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, adding to its popular interest. Other specific integers (such as TREE(3)) known to be far larger than Graham&#x27;s number have since appeared in many serious mathematical proofs, for example in connection with Harvey Friedman&#x27;s various finite forms of Kruskal&#x27;s theorem. Additionally, smaller upper bounds on the Ramsey theory problem from which Graham&#x27;s number was derived have since been proven to be valid.

==Context==
Graham&#x27;s number is connected to the following problem in Ramsey theory:
In 1971, Graham and Rothschild proved the Graham–Rothschild theorem on the Ramsey theory of parameter words, a special case of which shows that this problem has a solution &quot;N*&quot;. They bounded the value of &quot;N*&quot; by , with &quot;N&quot; being a large but explicitly defined number

:formula_4

where formula_5 in Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation; the number is between and in Conway chained arrow notation. This was reduced in 2014 via upper bounds on the Hales–Jewett number to

:formula_6

which contains three tetrations. In 2019 this was further improved to:

:formula_7 

The lower bound of 6 was later improved to 11 by Geoffrey Exoo in 2003, and to 13 by Jerome Barkley in 2008. Thus, the best known bounds for &quot;N*&quot; are .

Graham&#x27;s number, &quot;G&quot;, is much larger than &quot;N&quot;: it is formula_8, where formula_9. This weaker upper bound for the problem, attributed to an unpublished work of Graham, was eventually published and named by Martin Gardner in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in November 1977.

==Publication==
The number gained a degree of popular attention when Martin Gardner described it in the &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; section of &quot;Scientific American&quot; in November 1977, writing that Graham had recently established, in an unpublished proof, &quot;a bound so vast that it holds the record for the largest number ever used in a serious mathematical proof.&quot; The 1980 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; repeated Gardner&#x27;s claim, adding to the popular interest in this number. According to physicist John Baez, Graham invented the quantity now known as Graham&#x27;s number in conversation with Gardner. While Graham was trying to explain a result in Ramsey theory which he had derived with his collaborator Bruce Lee Rothschild, Graham found that the said quantity was easier to explain than the actual number appearing in the proof. Because the number which Graham described to Gardner is larger than the number in the paper itself, both are valid upper bounds for the solution to the problem studied by Graham and Rothschild.

==Definition==
Using Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation, Graham&#x27;s number &quot;G&quot; (as defined in Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Scientific American&quot; article) is
formula_10

where the number of &quot;arrows&quot; in each layer is specified by the value of the next layer below it; that is,

formula_11 where formula_12 formula_13

and where a superscript on an up-arrow indicates how many arrows there are. In other words, &quot;G&quot; is calculated in 64 steps: the first step is to calculate &quot;g&quot;1 with four up-arrows between 3s; the second step is to calculate &quot;g&quot;2 with &quot;g&quot;1 up-arrows between 3s; the third step is to calculate &quot;g&quot;3 with &quot;g&quot;2 up-arrows between 3s; and so on, until finally calculating &quot;G&quot; = &quot;g&quot;64 with &quot;g&quot;63 up-arrows between 3s.

Equivalently,
formula_14

and the superscript on &quot;f&quot; indicates an iteration of the function, e.g., formula_15. Expressed in terms of the family of hyperoperations formula_16, the function &quot;f&quot; is the particular sequence formula_17, which is a version of the rapidly growing Ackermann function &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot;). (In fact, formula_18 for all &quot;n&quot;.) The function &quot;f&quot; can also be expressed in Conway chained arrow notation as formula_19, and this notation also provides the following bounds on &quot;G&quot;:

formula_20

===Magnitude===
To convey the difficulty of appreciating the enormous size of Graham&#x27;s number, it may be helpful to express—in terms of exponentiation alone—just the first term (&quot;g&quot;1) of the rapidly growing 64-term sequence. First, in terms of tetration (formula_21) alone:
formula_22

where the number of 3s in the expression on the right is
formula_23

Now each tetration (formula_24) operation reduces to a power tower (formula_25) according to the definition
formula_26 where there are &quot;X&quot; 3s.

Thus,
formula_27

becomes, solely in terms of repeated &quot;exponentiation towers&quot;,
formula_28

and where the number of 3s in each tower, starting from the leftmost tower, is specified by the value of the next tower to the right.

In other words, &quot;g&quot;1 is computed by first calculating the number of towers, formula_29 (where the number of 3s is formula_30), and then computing the &quot;n&quot;th tower in the following sequence:

 1st tower: 3
 2nd tower: 3↑3↑3 (number of 3s is 3) = 7625597484987
 3rd tower: 3↑3↑3↑3↑...↑3 (number of 3s is 7625597484987) = …
 ⋮
 &quot;g&quot;1 = &quot;n&quot;th tower: 3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑3↑...↑3 (number of 3s is given by the tower)
where the number of 3s in each successive tower is given by the tower just before it. The result of calculating the third tower is the value of &quot;n&quot;, the number of towers for &quot;g&quot;1.

The magnitude of this first term, &quot;g&quot;1, is so large that it is practically incomprehensible, even though the above display is relatively easy to comprehend. Even &quot;n&quot;, the mere &quot;number of towers&quot; in this formula for &quot;g&quot;1, is far greater than the number of Planck volumes (roughly 10185 of them) into which one can imagine subdividing the observable universe. And after this first term, still another 63 terms remain in the rapidly growing &quot;g&quot; sequence before Graham&#x27;s number &quot;G&quot; = &quot;g&quot;64 is reached. To illustrate just how fast this sequence grows, while &quot;g&quot;1 is equal to formula_31 with only four up arrows, the number of up arrows in &quot;g&quot;2 is this incomprehensibly large number &quot;g&quot;1.

==Mod &quot;n&quot;==

The residue of Graham&#x27;s number mod &quot;n&quot;, start with &quot;n&quot; = 1, is

:0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3, 6, 3, 0, 7, 9, 3, 1, 13, 12, 11, 7, 9, 18, 7, 6, 9, 18, 3, 12, 1, 0, 27, 10, 27, 23, 27, 9, 7, 27, 27, 36, 37, 27, 27, 27, 27, 2, 31, 27, 41, 6, 27, 6, 37, …

<text>Gustaf Otto Gustafsson Stenbock (17 September 1614, Torpa stenhus – 24 September 1685, Stockholm) was a Swedish military officer and politician.

== Biography ==
He was a member of the noble Stenbock family; born to the Riksråd (Privy Councilor) and his wife, Countess Beata Margareta née Brahe (1583–1645). He was therefore related to the royal family on his father&#x27;s side.

In 1631, he joined the Småland Cavalry Regiment. From 1633, he fought in Germany, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and took part in the Battle of Nördlingen, among others. He won promotions to Commander of the Kronoberg Regiment (1637), and Colonel of the Jönköping Regiment (1639). He was seriously wounded at the Second Battle of Breitenfeld in 1642, and returned home. He continued to pursue a miltitary career, however, participating in several campaigns and being promoted to Major General (1643), Lieutenant General (1647) and General of the Infantry (1648). Following the brief war between Sweden and Bremen (1654), he was promoted to Field Marshal. During the Second Northern War, he received a final promotion to General Field Marshal. 

Following the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), he received his first civilian appointment, as Governor General of the newly annexed provinces of Schonen, Halland und Blekinge; acquired from Denmark. In 1664, this led to another military appointment, as Lord High Admiral of Sweden, although he had never served in the Navy and had no seafaring experience. It was generally believed to be compensation for being passed over for Marshal of the Realm. During the Scanian War, the Swedish navy suffered devastating losses. In 1676, Stenbock and two other inexperienced Admirals were held accountable. He was deposed and the office abolished. He was also fined 200,000 Thalers. 

A year later, he was rehabilitated by King Charles XI, and his fine was reduced to 100,000 Thalers. He was also allowed to command a campaign against Norway, during which he was able to lift the . In 1680, after the end of the Scanian War, he was given permission to call himself &quot;Supreme Admiral&quot;, although he had no authority. His last few years were marred by illness and poverty.

<doc id="234235" wikidata="Q155878" url="?curid=234235" title="Black grouse">
<text>The black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), also known as northern black grouse, Eurasian black grouse, blackgame or blackcock, is a large bird in the grouse family. It is a sedentary species, spanning across the Palearctic in moorland and steppe habitat when breeding, often near wooded areas. They will spend the winter perched in dense forests, feeding almost exclusively on the needles of conifers. The black grouse is one of two species of grouse in the genus &quot;Lyrurus&quot;, the other being the lesser-known Caucasian grouse.

The female is greyish-brown and has a cackling or warbling call. She takes all responsibility for nesting and caring for the chicks, as typical with most galliforms.

The black grouse&#x27;s genome was sequenced in 2014.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The black grouse was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao tetrix&quot;. Both &quot;Tetrao&quot; and &quot;tetrix&quot; come from Ancient Greek words referring to some form of game bird. The black grouse is now placed in the genus &quot;Lyrurus&quot; that was introduced in 1832 by the English naturalist William Swainson.

The male and female are sometimes referred to by their folk names, &quot;blackcock&quot; and &quot;greyhen,&quot; respectively. These names first occur in the literature with John Ray in 1674. &quot;Heathcock&quot; and &quot;Heathhen&quot; are also common names.

=== Subspecies ===
The black grouse has six recognized subspecies. Black grouse populations differ slightly in size and coloration, with birds increasing in size further east of their range:

* &quot;L. t. baikalensis&quot; (Lorenz T., 1911) - southeastern Siberia to northern Mongolia and northwestern Manchuria (China)
* &quot;L. t. britannicus&quot; (Witherby &amp; Lönnberg, 1913) - Scotland, Wales and northern England
* &quot;L. t. mongolicus&quot; (Lönnberg, 1904) - eastern Kyrgyzstan and northwestern China towards eastern Kazakhstan, south-central Siberia and western Mongolia
* &quot;L. t. tetrix&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) - Scandinavia to southern France and northern Italy and northeastern Siberia
* &quot;L. t. ussuriensis&quot; (Kohts, 1911) - eastern Siberia and northeastern China including northwest Korea.
* &quot;L. t. viridanus&quot; (Lorenz T., 1891) - southeastern Russia to southwestern Siberia

==Description and appearance==
The black grouse is a large bird with males measuring roughly around in length and weighing , sometimes up to , with females approximately and weighing . The cock&#x27;s fancy plumage is predominantly black with deep-blue hues on his neck and back, which contrasts the white wingline and undertail coverts, as well as red bare skin above each eye. On the other hand, the hen is much drabber and cryptically colored to blend in easily with the dense undergrowth, especially when nesting. The black grouse, along with the Caucasian grouse, has long outer rectrices (tail feathers) that curl outward and arranged in a way it resembles the frame of a Greek lyre, hence the genus name, &quot;Lyrurus&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Black grouse can be found on open habitats across Europe (Swiss-Italian-French Alps especially) from Great Britain through Scandinavia, Estonia and across Russia. Although believed to once to live in Ireland, it now no longer resides there. In Eastern Europe they can be found in Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Romania and Ukraine. There is a population in the Alps, and isolated remnants in Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. It formerly occurred in Denmark, but the Danish Ornithological Society (DOF) has considered it extinct since 2001. The species disappeared from Bulgaria in the 19th century. In Asia, a huge portion of their population can be found in Russia (particularly southern Siberia), though they also inhabit parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, and possibly Korea.

Black grouse are adapted to an extensive array of habitats across Eurasia, though most frequently utilize the transitionary zones between forests and open clearings, especially steppe, heathland, grassland and pasture when near agricultural fields. Depending on the season, they will overwinter in large flocks in dense forests, and feed primarily on the leaves and buds of coniferous and broadleaf trees, such as Scots pine, Siberian larch, silver birch, and Eurasian aspen. Throughout the spring and summer, they tend to favor open spaces to seek potential mates and raise broods, switching their diet to berries, shoots and stems of cranberries, bog bilberries, myrtleberries, and other &quot;Vaccinium&quot; shrubs. They avoid the most extreme of desert and polar regions.

==Conservation status==
Although this species has declined throughout most of its range in western Europe, it is not considered to be vulnerable globally due to the large population (global estimate is 15–40 million individuals) and slow rate of decline. Its decline is due to loss of habitat, disturbance, predation by foxes, crows, etc., and small populations gradually dying out.

The IUCN implemented a Black Grouse Action Plan 2007–2010. This has looked at local populations that are vulnerable to the extinction vortex. For example, in Styria, Austria.

In the United Kingdom black grouse are found in upland areas of Wales, the Pennines and most of Scotland. Best looked for on farmland and moorland with nearby forestry or scattered trees. They have traditional lek sites where the males display.

They have declined in some parts of the UK (especially England), having disappeared from many of their former haunts. They are now extirpated in Lancashire, Derbyshire, Exmoor, East Yorkshire, New Forest, Nottinghamshire, Worcestershire, Quantock Hills, Cornwall, Dartmoor, Kent, Wiltshire and Surrey.

A programme to re-introduce black grouse into the wild started in 2003 in the Upper Derwent Valley area of the Peak District in England. 30 grouse were released in October 2003, followed by 10 male grouse in December 2004 and a further 10 males and 10 females in April 2005. The programme is being run jointly by the National Trust, Severn Trent Water and Peak District National Park.

Conservation groups helping to revive the black grouse include the RSPB and the Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust.

In France there has been much work regarding the birds and their risk of flying into ski-lifts.

From 1950 to 2000, local black grouse populations have steadily diminished in Manchuria and northeastern China by about 39%, with birds being most affected (and possibly extirpated) in the Jilin Province. Though the exact causes for local declines remain largely unclear, habitat loss and excess hunting have played a part in the overall reduction. Shifts in their location, however can happen concurrently with the depletion over decades, so short-term research projects may not provide much proof of driving forces behind population alterations.

Based on historical info gathered from various sources (including wildlife surveys and scientific papers), aspen, birch, and poplar make up the black grouse&#x27;s staple diet and habitat. The climate and precipitation during the month of June is also linked to the breeding success of black grouse.

==Breeding and nesting==


Black grouse have a very distinctive and well-recorded courtship ritual. Every dawn in the spring, male grouse begin competition with other males in hopes of attracting a hen to mate with. They will display to signal their territory and vigor by fanning out their elaborate lyre-shaped tails and inflating their necks on designated open ground called a lek. Their song consists of a long, dove-like bubbling coo or murmur. Black grouse hens visiting the lek decide the overall healthiest male, though not all females may arrive at every lek.

In western Europe, these leks seldom contain more than 40 birds; in Russia, 150 is not uncommon and 200 have been recorded.

When mated successfully, she will fly away from the site to a suitable nesting site with an abundance of dense shrub or tall vegetation, often located at a tree base in between roots, under low branches, beside a boulder, or extremely rarely, a used raptor&#x27;s or corvid&#x27;s nest off the ground. A dent ( wide by deep) is scraped out on the dirt floor and cushioned with grasses, sticks, leaves, and feathers. About 6-11 pale buff eggs speckled brown are then laid in the nest, incubated for approx. 23–28 days. The chicks consume invertebrates, transitioning to more plant matter as they mature. By around 10–14 days and so forth, they are capable of short flights.

Where their range overlaps in similar biomes of other species, they are capable of hybridizing with the ringneck pheasant, western capercaillie, black-billed capercaillie, Siberian grouse, hazel grouse, and willow ptarmigan.

==Relationship to humans==

The tails of black-cocks have, since late Victorian times, been popular adornments for hats worn with Highland Dress. Most commonly associated with Glengarry and Balmoral or Tam o&#x27; Shanter caps, they still continue to be worn by pipers of civilian and military pipe bands. Since 1904, all ranks of the Royal Scots and King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers have worn them in their full-dress headgear and that tradition is carried on in the dress glengarries of the current Scottish super regiment, the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

<text>Karl Friedrich Hermann (4 August 1804 – 31 December 1855) was a German classical scholar and antiquary.

==Biography==

He was born at Frankfurt-am-Main. Having studied philosophy at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig (and taking a degree in 1824), he went on a tour of Italy; on his return from which he lectured as &quot;privatdozent&quot; in Heidelberg. In 1832 he was appointed professor of classical philology at the University of Marburg, and in 1833 received the additional offices of second librarian at the university, and director of the philological seminary. In 1842 he transferred to Göttingen as the chair of philology and archaeology, vacant by the death of Otfried Müller. At Göttingen, his colleagues were Friedrich Wilhelm Schneidewin, Ernst von Leutsch and Friedrich Wieseler.

==Works==
His knowledge of all branches of classical learning was profound, but he was chiefly distinguished for his works on Greek antiquities and ancient philosophy. Among these may be mentioned, the &quot;Lehrbuch der griechischen Antiquitäten&quot; (1858) dealing with political, religious and domestic antiquities; the &quot;Geschichte und System der Platonischen Philosophie&quot; (1839), unfinished; an edition of the &quot;Platonis Dialogi&quot; (&quot;Platonic dialogues&quot;), 6 volumes, (1851–1853); and &quot;Culturgeschichte der Griechen und Römer&quot; (1857), published after his death by Karl Gustav Schmidt. He also edited the text of Juvenal and Persius (1854) and Lucian&#x27;s &quot;De conscribenda historia&quot; (1828). A collection of &quot;Abhandlungen und Beiträge&quot; appeared in 1849.

<doc id="234237" wikidata="Q977613" url="?curid=234237" title="Yorkshire Dales">
<text>The Yorkshire Dales are a series of valleys, or dales, in the Pennines, an upland range in England. They are mostly located in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, but extend into Cumbria and Lancashire; they are entirely within the historic boundaries of Yorkshire. The majority of the dales are within the Yorkshire Dales National Park, created in 1954. The exception is the area around Nidderdale, which forms the separate Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The landscape of the Yorkshire Dales consists of sheltered glacial valleys separated by exposed moorland. The predominant rock is Carboniferous Limestone, which is particularly visible in the south-west in features such as Malham Cove. It is overlain in many areas by the Yoredale Series of alternating weak shales and hard limestones and sandstones, which give the dales their characteristic &#x27;stepped&#x27; appearance. Most of the dales contain rivers, and the area contains seven primary catchments: the Swale, Ure, Wharfe, Aire, Nidd, Ribble, and Lune. There are several notable cave systems in the area, including part of the longest system in the United Kingdom, the Three Counties.

Agriculture and other land management has significantly affected the appearance of the Dales, through the creation of pastures and meadows for livestock grazing and moorland for red grouse shooting. Dry stone walls and field barns are characteristic of the valley floors, particularly Wensleydale and Swaledale in the north. Wensleydale cheese is a particularly famous product from the region. The dales are popular for hiking, and are crossed by the Dales Way, Pennine Way, and Coast to Coast long-distance footpaths. The Yorkshire Three Peaks is a walking trail entirely within the area which takes in its three highest mountains: Ingleborough (), Whernside (), and Pen-y-ghent (). The extensive cave systems are a major centre for caving in the UK.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;dale&quot;, like &quot;dell&quot;, is derived from the Old English word &quot;dæl&quot;. It has cognates in the Nordic/Germanic words for valley (&quot;dal&quot;, &quot;tal&quot;), and occurs in valley names across Yorkshire and Northern England. Usage here may have been reinforced by Nordic languages during the time of the Danelaw.

Most of the dales are named after their river or stream (e.g., Arkengarthdale, formed by Arkle Beck). The best-known exception is Wensleydale, which is named after the small village and former market town of Wensley, rather than the River Ure, although an older name for the dale is Yoredale. River valleys all over Yorkshire are called &quot;(name of river)+dale&quot;—but only the more northern valleys (and only the upper, rural, reaches) are included in the term &quot;The Dales&quot;.

==Geography==

The Yorkshire Dales are surrounded by the North Pennines and Orton Fells in the north, the Vales of York and Mowbray in the east, the South Pennines in the south, and the Lake District and Howgill Fells to the west. They spread to the north from the market and spa towns of Settle, Skipton, and Harrogate in North Yorkshire, to the southern boundary in Wharfedale and Airedale. Natural England define the area as most of the Yorkshire Dales National Park with fringes of the Nidderdale AONB, but without the towns listed above apart from Settle.

The lower reaches of Airedale and Wharfedale are not usually included in the area, and Calderdale, south of Airedale and in the South Pennines, is not often considered part of the Dales (even though it is a dale, is in Yorkshire, and its upper reaches are as scenic and rural as many further north). Additionally, although the National Park includes the Howgill Fells and Orton Fells, they are not usually considered part of the Dales.

Most of the larger southern dales – Ribblesdale, Malhamdale and Airedale, Wharfedale and Nidderdale – run roughly parallel from north to south. The more northerly dales – Wensleydale and Swaledale – run generally from west to east. There are many other smaller or lesser-known dales such as Arkengarthdale, Bishopdale, Clapdale, Coverdale, Kingsdale, Littondale, Langstrothdale, Raydale Waldendale and the Washburn Valley whose tributary streams and rivers feed into the larger valleys, and Barbondale, Dentdale, Deepdale and Garsdale which feed west to the River Lune.

The characteristic scenery of the Dales is green upland pastures separated by dry-stone walls and grazed by sheep and cattle. A survey carried out in 1988 estimated that there were just over of dry-stone walling in the Yorkshire Dales. Many upland areas consist of heather moorland, used for grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth).

==Cultural aspects==
Much of the rural area is used for agriculture, with residents living in small villages and hamlets or in farmsteads. Miles of dry-stone walls and much of the traditional architecture have remained, including some field barns, though many are no longer in active use. Breeding of sheep and rearing of cattle remain common. To supplement their incomes, many farmers have diversified, with some providing accommodations for tourists. A number of agricultural shows are held each year.

Lead mining was common in some areas of the Dales in the 19th century, particularly during 1821 to 1861, and some industrial remains can still be found, such as the Grassington miners&#x27; cottages. Certain former mining sites are maintained by Historic England. The Grassington Moor Lead Mining Trail, with its many remaining structures, has received funding from a variety of sources. The Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority provides a mobile-device software app for those who wish to explore the relevant areas.

==Tourism==
In this primarily agricultural area, tourism has become an important contributor to the economy. In 2016, there were 3.8 million visits to the Yorkshire Dales National Park including 0.48 million who stayed at least one night. The park authority estimates that this contributed £252 million to the economy and provided 3,583 full-time equivalent jobs. The wider Yorkshire Dales area received 9.7 million visitors who contributed £644 million to the economy.
Visitors are often attracted by the hiking trails, including some that lead to waterfalls and picturesque villages and small towns. These include Kirkby Lonsdale (just outside the area), Hawes, Appletreewick, Masham, Clapham, Long Preston and Malham.

The Settle–Carlisle line railway, operated by Network Rail, runs through the National Park using tunnels and viaducts, including Ribblehead.

The top-rated attractions according to travellers using the Trip Advisor site include Aysgarth Falls, Malham Cove (scenic walking areas), Ingleborough (hiking trails) and Ribblehead Viaduct.

The DalesBus service provides service in the Dales on certain days in summer, &quot;including the Yorkshire Dales National Park and Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&quot;. In summer, these buses supplement the other services operating year-round in the Dales.

Tourism in the region declined because of restrictions implemented in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and into 2021. Later in 2021, the volume of visits was expected to increase as a result of the 2020 TV series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, largely filmed within the Dales. The first series aired in the UK in September 2020 and in the US in early 2021. One source stated that visits to Yorkshire websites had increased significantly by late September 2020. By early 2021, the &quot;Discover England&quot; websites, for example, were using the tagline &quot;Discover &#x27;All Creatures Great and Small&#x27; in Yorkshire&quot;.

==Geology==
The dales are U- and V-shaped valleys, the former enlarged and shaped by glaciers, mainly in the most recent Devensian ice age. The underlying rock is mainly Carboniferous Limestone, which results in a large areas of karst topography, in places overlain with shale and sandstone and topped with Millstone Grit, although to the north and west of the Dent Fault the hills are formed from older Silurian and Ordovician rocks.

==Cave systems==
The underlying limestone in parts of the Dales has extensive cave systems, including the Three Counties System, making it a major area for caving in the UK. There are over 2500 known caves; some are open to the public for tours. Visitors can try caving at one of the show caves: White Scar Cave, Ingleborough Cave or Stump Cross Caverns near Greenhow.

The systems include:

* Gaping Gill System
* Alum Pot System
* Mossdale Caverns
* Leck Fell Caves
* Easegill System
* White Scar Caves in Chapel-le-Dale near Ingleton
* Ingleborough Cave in Clapdale near Clapham
* Stump Cross Caverns near Pateley Bridge
* Goyden System near Pateley Bridge

<doc id="234243" wikidata="Q7852" url="?curid=234243" title="World Rally Championship">
<text>The World Rally Championship (abbreviated as WRC) is an international rallying series owned and governed by the FIA. Inaugurated in 1973, it is the second oldest of the FIA&#x27;s world championships after Formula One. Each season lasts one calendar year, and separate championship titles are awarded to drivers, co-drivers and manufacturers. There are also two support championships, WRC2 and WRC3, which are contested on the same events and stages as the WRC, but with progressively lower maximum performance and running costs of the cars permitted. Junior WRC is also contested on five events of the World Rally Championship calendar.

A WRC season typically consists of 13 three- to four-day rally events driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Each rally is usually split into 15–25 special stages which are run against the clock on up to of closed roads.

== The championships ==
=== World Rally Championship for Manufacturers ===
Manufacturers must register to be eligible to score in the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers and must compete in every rally of the season with Group Rally1 specification cars (World Rally Car between 1997 and 2021).

As the manufacturers use the highest performance car and usually employ the best drivers it is usually the case that these crews and cars take the majority of drivers/co-drivers championship points. Thus, combined with the money invested by the manufacturer teams, promotion of the WRC only tends to include the manufacturer crews and privateers in the Rally1 car or World Rally Car. These crews are given Priority 1 (P1) status on rallies and contest the stages before other crews. However it is not unusual for competitors in lower performance cars to take points in the drivers or co-driver&#x27;s championships.

=== World Rally Championships for Drivers and Co-Drivers ===
Any crew entering any WRC rally are eligible to score points in the overall World Rally Championship for Drivers and World Rally Championship for Co-Drivers. This is regardless of car technical class, number of rallies entered or if they are also entered into the support championships. Although co-drivers are permitted to drive the cars at any point during the rally, they must only do so under a &#x27;force majeure&#x27;.

=== Support championships ===
The World Rally Championship also features support championships called WRC2 and WRC3. These championships are contested on the same events and stages as the WRC calendar and have tighter restrictions on eligible car criteria.

==== WRC2 ====

WRC2 is contested using only Rally2 cars with championships for drivers, co-drivers and teams. Drivers and co-drivers can enter a maximum of 7 events and their best 6 results will count towards their championship tally. Teams &quot;must&quot; enter two cars into a maximum of 7 events, only 5 of 6 events entered in Europe will score, with points from a 7th rally entered outside Europe also scoring points towards the championship tally. Power stage points are also awarded. Drivers, co-drivers and teams must all nominate if they wish to be eligible for championship points before a rally and can do so independently. For that reason the same crew pair in the same team may compete in all events in a season yet nominate and score points in different events. Crews competing in WRC2 are given Priority 2 status and run the stages immediately after P1 crews. WRC2 replaced SWRC when Group R was introduced in 2013 and the eligibility rules relaxed.

In 2023, WRC2 Challenger Driver and Co-Driver Championships will run for WRC2 drivers who have not won the series before, or who have not driven for a manufacturer entry in the previous 5 years.

==== WRC3 ====

WRC3 is contested using only Group Rally3 cars (Group Rally2 in 2020 and 2021), with championships for drivers and co-drivers. Designed for privateer drivers, WRC3 has lower entry costs than WRC2 and there are restrictions on who can enter, testing and professional support received. Drivers and co-drivers can enter up to 5 rallies with their best 4 scoring championship points, and scoring rounds must also be nominated beforehand. Between 2013 and 2018, the championship was contested using two wheel drive cars from R1, R2 and R3 classes of Group R. No championship ran in 2019 but was reinstated in its current format in . Crews competing in WRC3 are given Priority 3 status to run after the WRC2 crews.

==== Junior WRC ====

Junior WRC is an arrive-and-drive format championship run over 5 events of the WRC calendar using Ford Fiesta Rally3 cars provided by M-Sport. Drivers have to be under 29 and must register. Championship titles are awarded to drivers and co-drivers, though there is no age restriction for co-drivers.

The Junior World Rally Championship was previously an open championship for younger drivers in S1600 cars from 2001. In 2011 it became a closed FIA sanctioned championship run by either M-Sport or Citroën in the current format. Ford Fiesta R2/Rally4 or Citroën DS3 R3 cars were provided, maintained and serviced for each entrant. Championships were awarded to drivers, co-drivers and nations. Only 5 rounds of the WRC calendar were competed with the best 4 results counting towards championship points, although the final round was worth double points. The highest scoring driver from each country registered points for the nations championship. Uniquely for this series, points were also awarded for stage wins.

==== WRC Masters Cup ====
In 2023 the FIA WRC Masters Cup will run for the first time. The cup is open to drivers and co-drivers over 50 years of age and may enter in any WRC eligible car except Rally1. The cup effectively replaces WRC2 Masters Cup which ran in 2022 for WRC2 entrants of the same criteria.

==== Discontinued support championships ====
*The WRC Academy was an alternative name for Junior WRC between 2011 and 2012, the first years the championship became a one-make series before reverting to the Junior WRC name.

*The World Rally Championship Ladies Cup ran from 1990 to 1995 and could be won by any class of car. Louise Aitken-Walker was the first winner.

*The Production car World Rally Championship (P-WRC) began in 1987 as the FIA Group N Cup before being renamed in 2002. Cars in the championship were production-based and homologated under Group N rules. From 2013, the Production WRC was renamed WRC3 including Group R cars with two-wheel drive (R3, R2 and R1).

*The 2-Litre World Rally Cup ran from 1993 to 1999 using front wheel drive cars with engine capacities up to 2000cc. With relaxed rules the cars could often outpace the Group A and World Rally Cars of the main category. The series was abandoned due to high costs and the Super 2000 and Super 1600 specification cars that the series inspired later became the origins for SWRC and JWRC.

*The Super 2000 World Rally Championship (S-WRC) was started in 2010 using Super 2000 category cars. There were competitions for drivers (known as the S-WRC) and another for teams (the World Rally Championship Cup). From 2013, WRC2 replaced S-WRC and including cars with four-wheel drive (R5, R4 and S2000).

*The WRC Trophy was run in 2017 for privateers entering with older World Rally Cars when the new WRC+ was introduced. Crews were eligible to enter up to seven rounds of the World Rally Championship, with their best six results counting towards their final points tally in the trophy. WRC Trophy entrants were still eligible to score World Rally Championship points separately to the WRC Trophy. The Trophy was discontinued after the 2017 season.

*WRC 2 Pro ran only in 2019 and was open to manufacturer-supported teams entering cars complying with Group R5 regulations. It was replaced in 2020 with the Rally2 based WRC3.

One-make series tournaments have also run on select rounds of the WRC calendar. They were privately administered rally tournaments but permitted to run on the rallies alongside the WRC. Examples include the Ford Fiesta Sporting Trophy (2006, 2007 and 2009) and DMACK Fiesta Trophy (2014–2016), both run by M-Sport, and Citroën Top Driver (2013) run by Citroën. Neither team held these tournaments in the years they had the rights to manage the JWRC on the FIA&#x27;s behalf.

==History==
===Early===
The World Rally Championship was formed from well-known international rallies, nine of which were previously part of the International Championship for Manufacturers (IMC), which was contested from 1970 to 1972. The 1973 World Rally Championship was the inaugural season of the WRC and began with the Monte Carlo Rally on 19 January.

Alpine-Renault won the first manufacturer&#x27;s world championship with its Alpine A110, after which Lancia took the title three years in a row with the Ferrari V6-powered Lancia Stratos HF, the first car designed and manufactured specifically for rallying. The first drivers&#x27; world championship was not awarded until 1979, although 1977 and 1978 seasons included an &quot;FIA Cup for Drivers&quot;, won by Italy&#x27;s Sandro Munari and Finland&#x27;s Markku Alén respectively. Sweden&#x27;s Björn Waldegård became the first official world champion, edging out Finland&#x27;s Hannu Mikkola by one point. Fiat took the manufacturers&#x27; title with the Fiat 131 Abarth in 1977, 1978 and 1980, Ford with its Escort RS1800 in 1979 and Talbot with its Sunbeam Lotus in 1981. Waldegård was followed by German Walter Röhrl and Finn Ari Vatanen as drivers&#x27; world champions.

===Group B era===

The 1980s saw the rear-wheel-drive Group 2 and the more popular Group 4 cars be replaced by more powerful four-wheel-drive Group B cars. FISA legalized all-wheel-drive in 1979, but most manufacturers believed it was too complex to be successful. However, after Audi started entering Mikkola and the new four-wheel-drive Quattro in rallies for testing purposes with immediate success, other manufacturers started their all-wheel-drive projects. Group B regulations were introduced in the 1982, and with only a few restrictions allowed almost unlimited power. Audi took the manufacturers&#x27; title in 1982 and 1984 and drivers&#x27; title in 1983 (Mikkola) and 1984 (Stig Blomqvist). Audi&#x27;s French female driver Michèle Mouton and her co-driver Fabrizia Pons came close to winning the title in 1982, but had to settle for second place after Opel rival Röhrl. The 1985 title seemed set to go to Vatanen and his Peugeot 205 T16 but a bad accident at the Rally Argentina left him to watch compatriot and teammate Timo Salonen take the title instead. Italian Attilio Bettega had an even more severe crash with his Lancia 037 at the Tour de Corse and died instantly.

The 1986 season started with impressive performances by Finns Henri Toivonen and Alén in Lancia&#x27;s new turbo- and supercharged Delta S4, which could reportedly accelerate from 0–60 mph (96 km/h) in 2.3 seconds, on a gravel road. However, the season soon took a dramatic turn. At the Rally Portugal, three spectators were killed and over 30 injured after Joaquim Santos lost control of his Ford RS200. At the Tour de Corse, championship favourite Toivonen and his co-driver Sergio Cresto died in a fireball accident after plunging down a cliff. Only hours after the crash, Jean-Marie Balestre and the FISA decided to freeze the development of the Group B cars and ban them from competing in 1987. More controversy followed when Peugeot&#x27;s Juha Kankkunen won the title after FIA annulled the results of the San Remo Rally, taking the title from fellow Finn Markku Alén.

===Group A era===
As the planned Group S was also cancelled, Group A regulations became the standard in the WRC until 1997. A separate Group A championship had been organized as part of the WRC already in 1986, with Sweden&#x27;s Kenneth Eriksson taking the title with a Volkswagen Golf GTI 16V. Lancia was quickest in adapting to the new regulations and controlled the world rally scene with Lancia Delta HF, winning the manufacturers&#x27; title six years in a row from 1987 to 1992 and remains the most successful marque in the history of the WRC. Kankkunen and Miki Biasion both took two drivers&#x27; titles with the Lancia Delta HF.
The 1990s then saw the Japanese manufacturers, Toyota, Subaru and Mitsubishi, become title favourites. Spain&#x27;s Carlos Sainz driving for Toyota Team Europe took the 1990 and 1992 titles with a Toyota Celica GT-Four. Kankkunen moved to Toyota for the 1993 season and won his record fourth title, with Toyota taking its first manufacturers&#x27; crown. Frenchman Didier Auriol brought the team further success in 1994, and soon Subaru and Mitsubishi continued the success of the Japanese manufacturers. Scotsman Colin McRae won the drivers&#x27; world championship in 1995 and Subaru took the manufacturers&#x27; title three years in a row. Finland&#x27;s Tommi Mäkinen driving a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution won the drivers&#x27; championship four times in a row, from 1996 to 1999. Mitsubishi also won the manufacturers&#x27; title in 1998. Another notable car was the Ford Escort RS Cosworth, which was specifically designed for rallying. It was the first production car to produce downforce both at front and rear.

===World Rally Car era===
For the 1997 World Rally Championship, the World Rally Car regulations were introduced as an intended replacement for Group A (only successive works Mitsubishis still conforming to the latter formula; until they, too, homologated a Lancer Evolution WRC from the 2001 San Remo Rally). After the success of Mäkinen and the Japanese manufacturers, France&#x27;s Peugeot made a very successful return to the World Rally Championship. Finn Marcus Grönholm took the drivers&#x27; title in his first full year in the series and Peugeot won the manufacturers&#x27; crown. England&#x27;s Richard Burns won the 2001 title with a Subaru Impreza WRC, but Grönholm and Peugeot took back both titles in the 2002. 2003 saw Norway&#x27;s Petter Solberg become drivers&#x27; champion for Subaru and Citroën continue the success of the French manufacturers. Citroën&#x27;s Sébastien Loeb went on to control the following seasons with his Citroën Xsara WRC. Citroën took the manufacturers&#x27; title three times in a row and Loeb surpassed Mäkinen&#x27;s record of four consecutive drivers&#x27; titles, earning his ninth consecutive championship in 2012. Suzuki and Subaru pulled out of the WRC at the end of the 2008 championship, both citing the economic downturn then affecting the automotive industry for their withdrawal. Mini and Ford both pulled out of the WRC at the end of the 2012 championship, due to a similar economic downturn affecting the European market, although Ford continued to give technical support to M-Sport. Volkswagen Motorsport entered the championship in 2013 and Sebastien Ogier dominated the series with six consecutive titles. Hyundai also returned to the series in 2014. New World Rally Car rules were introduced for 2017 which generated faster and more aggressive cars.

In 2018, Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT won the World Rally Championship earning Toyota their first manufacturers&#x27; title since 1999. With Tommi Mäkinen heading the team, he became the first person in the history of rally driving to win a Championship both as a driver and as a team principal. At the end of the following year, Citroën withdrew from the championship after Ogier left the team. Ott Tänak took the driver&#x27;s title breaking the French Sebastien&#x27;s (Loeb and Ogier) domination of the sport since 2004. Hyundai meanwhile, took the manufacturers championship title and repeated the success in 2020. Ogier returned to championship winning ways for 2020 and 2021 in a Toyota Yaris, though vowed that the new era of Rally1 would not be fully contested by himself. WRC said goodbye to the World Rally Car in 2021 after 25 years.

==Format and structure==
=== Calendar ===

Each WRC season consists of a number of rounds within the same calendar year and should ordinarily include rallies on a minimum of 3 continents. In the past the championship has visited every continent except Antarctica. Most recently there have been about 13 rallies though there have been as few as 7 such as in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. The rallies are typically driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice.

=== Rallies ===

The competitive special stages are driven on closed roads which are linked by non-competitive road sections known as liaisons. These roads are open to the public and all road laws of that country must be adhered to. The liaison routes are detailed in a &quot;road book&quot; given to each crew and must also be adhered to within a specified time limit to arrive at the next stage or &quot;time control&quot; point or else they face penalties. To help organise this, crews carry a &quot;timecard&quot; which is filled in at each time control or special stage by an official. An average day consists of a total of of driving. 
In the current era each rally usually consists of between fifteen and thirty special stages of distances ranging from under to over , not totalling more than . Any stage which deviates from the character of the rally or ordinary running of a special stage is known as a super special stage. These are often short and for spectators or promotional purposes and may be on a different surface such as asphalt on a gravel character rally, or they may be a head-to-head running where two cars start at the same time at different points in a loop format.

Since 2021 rallies must consist of only one surface type except where short super special stages are permitted that do not require a change in the car&#x27;s setup. In the past some rallies such as Sanremo or Rally Spain have had one day of gravel followed by another day of asphalt stages, requiring substantial changes in the setup of the car. Asphalt setups have 18&quot; wheels compared to 13&quot; on gravel or snow, combined with changes needed to the differentials, suspension travel and geometry.

A WRC event begins with reconnaissance (&quot;recce&quot;) on Tuesday and Wednesday, allowing crews to drive through the stages and create or update their pace notes. On Thursday, teams can run through the shakedown stage to practice and test their set-ups. The competition typically begins on either Thursday evening or Friday morning and ends on Sunday with the Power Stage. Cars start the stages at two-minute intervals in clear weather, or three-minute intervals if it is decided that visibility may be a problem for competitors. 
Each rally has one central service park where the cars are prepared and repaired if needed at the end of each loop and leg, however some rallies may organise a remote service and/or tyre fitting zone nearer to the stages during a leg. How much time can be spent working on the car once the rally has started is outlined in the rally&#x27;s itinerary. Between the days, after a final end of day service, cars are locked away in parc fermé, a quarantine environment where teams are not permitted to access or work on their cars.

=== Championship points ===
Points are awarded at the completion of each rally and contribute towards the world championship classifications, and those with the most points at the end of the season are given the championship titles. Up to the 2023 season, points were awarded to the top positions in the overall final classification of each rally, and from 2011, extra points for the Power Stage were introduced. A new points system was introduced for the 2024 season which did not include results in the final classification.

The driver&#x27;s championship and manufacturer&#x27;s championship are separate but based on a similar point system. Manufacturers must nominate up to three crews to be eligible for manufacturer championship points before an event. The two fastest nominated crews from each manufacturer form a new classification for the purpose of awarding manufacturer points. Retired crews cannot score points unless they have restarted and it is not unusual for a crew to finish far down the overall classification yet still score manufacturers points.

A driver can win the driver&#x27;s championship driving one car yet a different manufacturer can win the manufacturer&#x27;s championship which has occurred on several occasions, most recently in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2024.

===Power Stage===
First introduced in 2011, the &quot;Power Stage&quot; is the final stage of the rally and is typically televised live and immediately followed by the rally&#x27;s podium celebrations. Additional World Championship points are available to the five fastest drivers and co-drivers through the stage regardless of where they actually finish in the rally. The fastest team receiving five points, the second-fastest receiving four points, etc. and the fifth-fastest receiving one. In 2021 manufacturers began scoring power stage points following a similar system to the classification points, where only the top two nominated from each team can be eligible. While normal Special Stages are timed with an accuracy to the tenth of a second, the &quot;Power Stage&quot; timing is to the thousandth of a second.

===Restarting after retirement===
Crews are permitted to restart the following day if they are forced to retire. For each stage not completed however, a ten-minute penalty plus the winning stage time in the same priority group is added to the overall time. Originally known as &quot;SuperRally&quot; when introduced and later renamed &quot;Rally 2&quot;, the rules allow for a better return on investment for competitors and more action for spectators. The &quot;Rally 2&quot; name was dropped in 2019 as restarting became the norm, indeed crews are expected and assumed to be restarting unless they register a permanent retirement with the clerk of the course. The name was also dropped to avoid confusion with the new Rally2 group of car. Restarting is still at the discretion of the organisers, such as meeting safety standards after a heavy accident.

==Cars==
The rules surrounding which cars are used in WRC are governed and approved by the FIA. From the WRC&#x27;s inception, cars had always followed a basic rule of being Category I, &#x27;Series Production Cars&#x27; with a minimum production requirement to achieve homologation by the FIA. This ceased to be the case when Group Rally1 cars were introduced for the 2022 season. Rally1 regulations placed them in Category II as &#x27;Competition Cars&#x27;, which are built as single examples for exclusive use in competition.

The rules have changed over time to suit economic conditions, for safety reasons, to advance technology, to attract more manufacturer entrants or to better promote the series. Specifications of cars used can be for just one type, such as the World Rally Car, or a Group of similar specifications that differ in performance such as Group R. In 2014, the FIA introduced the current sporting classes to help further categorise the different classes and groups based on performance. RC1 has the highest performance cars whilst RC5 has the lowest permitted at WRC level.

To enter a WRC rally in 2022, cars must be homologated in one of the following groups or classes: World Rally Car 1.6L, any of the Groups Rally and R3 or R-GT of Group R

=== World Rally Car 1.6L ===
Eligible cars with 1.6L direct injection turbo engines and four-wheel drive built to World Rally Car regulations. The power output is limited to around . The &#x27;WRC+&#x27; cars including the Ford Fiesta WRC, Toyota Yaris WRC and the Hyundai i20 Coupe WRC cannot be driven by those who had scored manufacturer points between 2017 and 2021. Earlier WRC cars since 2011, such as the Volkswagen Polo R WRC are permitted without such restrictions. 2021 was the final season of this specification at the top of the sport, being replaced by Rally1 in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship in 2022.

===Groups Rally===
The Groups Rally consists of six rally car specifications eligible for WRC.
*Rally1 cars were introduced in 2022 and replaced the World Rally Car as the car permitted in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship. Hybrid powertrains were introduced for the first time in rallying amongst cost-cutting initiatives such as centrally developed tubular safety structures and simpler suspension and transmissions.
*Rally2 cars, formerly R5 of Group R, are the second highest performance cars and are the sole cars eligible for WRC-2.
*Rally2-Kit cars, previously known as R4-kit in Group R, are also eligible for overall entry. Rally2 and Rally2-Kit are within the same sporting category — RC2.
*Rally3 cars were introduced in 2021 and used in WRC3 from 2022.
*Rally4 cars, formerly R2 of Group R, do not have a specific support championship.
*Rally5 cars, formerly R1 of Group R, do not have a specific support championship.

=== Group R ===
Starting in 2008, a category of rally cars known as Group R were introduced as a rally only replacement to the Group A and Group N categories which were slowly phased out of eligibility. Cars were classified under one of six categories based on their engine capacity and type, wheelbase, and drivetrain. Group R cars still had to be homologated in Group A or N but have the relevant Group R extension approved in common with other rally formulae. As a result, older cars could reclassify under Group R subject to meeting criteria.

With R5, R4, R2 and R1 of Group R being renamed and absorbed by the new Groups Rally, as of the 2021 season R3 and R-GT cars are still currently eligible for overall entry. R3 cars however have been downgraded to RC4 sporting class from RC3, in line with Rally4 cars rather than superseding them. Neither R3 or R-GT have specific WRC support championships.

=== Historically eligible cars ===


When the WRC began in 1973, FISA allowed cars from its Group 1 (series-production touring cars), Group 2 (touring cars), Group 3 (series-production grand touring cars) and Group 4 (modified grand touring cars) amongst national classes. These FISA classes were also used in circuit racing and other motorsport championships. The groups formed the basis of new groups in 1982, Group N replaced Group 1, Group A replaced Group 2, and Group B replaced Group 4. Due to the increasing power, lack of reliability and a series of fatal accidents during the 1986 season, Group B was permanently banned. In 1987 Group A became the highest performance car and the choice for manufacturers whilst privateers opted for the budget friendly Group N for use in the newly created Production Car World Rally Championship. A Group N car has won a WRC rally only once - a Renault 5 driven by Alain Oreille won the Rallye Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 1989. Despite the PWRC ending in 2012, Group N cars were allowed to enter WRC2 until 2016 and overall rallies until the end of 2018.

In 1997, the World Rally Car specification was introduced to ease the development of new cars and bring new makes to the competition. An extension of Group A, the WRC cars were used in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship, although Mitsubishi received special dispensation to run their Group A models into 1999, and won three drivers and one manufacturers championships whilst doing so. In 2011 changes were made to the World Rally Car, the engine capacity was restricted to 1.6L and the minimum length requirement removed to allow for smaller and cost-effective models. Further changes in 2017 allowed for more aero-dynamics, increased safety requirements and a larger air intake restrictor, which increased the effective power from 300 to 380 hp.

Super 2000 cars were allowed to enter the overall rallies from 2007 to 2018. They were eligible in the PWRC from 2007 to 2009 before the Super 2000 World Rally Championship was run between 2010 and 2012. They were also accepted in WRC2 from 2013 to 2016. 
Super 1600 cars were only allowed to enter in JWRC and on events that the championship was held on up to 2010 before the R2 became the sole championship car.

===Tyres===
Historically, multiple brands have provided tyres to competitors. Pirelli was the single tyre supplier for the top class from to , then Michelin from to , and Pirelli again from to . Hankook was announced as the exclusive tyre supplier from 2025 to 2027.

WRC competitors use different tyres for dry and wet asphalt, gravel, snow and ice with studs or no studs, with different compound hardness also available. Hand cutting a tread pattern is not permitted.

For the 2023 season, Rally1 entries may use a maximum 28 tyres per round.

== Promotion and coverage ==

WRC Promoter GmbH owns the commercial rights to the WRC championships, responsible for all media coverage, sponsorship operations and encouraging of participants. WRC Promoter GmbH is jointly owned by Red Bull Media House and KW25 Beteiligungs GmbH. Through the Red Bull Content Pool, WRC provides news, articles and images for professional news and media outlets free of charge. The WRC.com website and mobile apps provides news, live rally times and results, championship standings and information about the rallies and championships. 

Commercial rights to the championship were first sold in 1996 to International Sportsworld Communicators (ISC), a company owned by Bernie Ecclestone who also held an FIA presidential position at the time. ISC was sold in 2000 to a group led by the then Subaru team boss David Richards, who later sold the company to North One Television in 2007. In 2009, ISC was awarded a 10-year contract to act as the first promoter for the championship from 2010. This new relationship included the FIA handing over responsibilities such as proposing new events and recruiting new sponsors. The contract with North One Sports (renamed from ISC) was cancelled by the FIA ahead of the 2012 season after the company entered into administration the previous year. The current promoter, WRC Promoter GmbH, was announced as the new promoter from the 2013 season. 

===Internet video===
In 2014, a digital subscription service named &quot;WRC+&quot; was launched providing video clips and live transmission of some stages each rally, including the power stage, as well as onboard footage and live map tracking of competitors. With the introduction of &quot;WRC+ All Live&quot; in 2018, for the first time in the championship&#x27;s history, every special stage from each round was shown for selected cars with commentary available in English. For the 2019 season, commentary in Spanish was available for all stages. German and Japanese were available since the 2021 Croatia Rally.

During the 2023 season, the WRC+ All Live service was replaced by a new service, Rally.TV, which amalgamated the service with a similar offer covering the FIA World Rallycross Championship. As well as offering a live service of all European Rally Championship rounds, a linear TV channel shows footage and documentaries between events, covering the three championships.

Brief and free video footage is also provided via social media platforms. In addition, the first running of Shakedown is often shown live on YouTube and Facebook.

Red Bull also produce feature-length programmes for Red Bull TV using stage footage from WRC TV combined with their own presenting team and insight from guest pundits. Dirtfish.com also provide some video content in a similar way, though usually not as long.

===WRC TV===
WRC TV produces previews, daily highlights and event reviews for each rally, as well as other magazine shows such as season reviews for broadcast television. Some TV stations also broadcast the power stage and select other stages live, usually two stages on a Saturday and the first run of what will be the power stage. Further, TV stations may broadcast the entire All Live live stream, typically via an interactive channel.

The make up and format for these programmes can vary from country to country depending on the local broadcaster and prominence of local drivers. In 2016, the cumulative worldwide TV audience for WRC TV&#x27;s programmes was more than 700 million, growing to 836 million in 2019. The programming is available in over 150 markets and more than 12,000 hours were screened globally in 2016, reducing to under 10,000 hours in 2019.

===Radio===

Live radio/audio coverage of the rallies was provided in English by a free service called &quot;World Rally Radio,&quot; broadcast via the Internet by Crown House Media. The service featured end of stage reports direct from the drivers and teams, up to date results and stage times plus other news in the service park. It also produced podcasts and featured contemporary music during breaks in rally coverage. World Rally Radio ceased in 2018 when WRC+ All Live began.

=== Podcasts ===
An official podcast is frequently produced. The latest version &quot;Backstories&quot; has interviewed drivers and co-drivers since 2020.

== Records and statistics ==

=== Manufacturers ===

21 different manufacturers have won a World Rally Championship event: Citroën, Ford, Lancia, Toyota, Peugeot, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, Audi, Fiat, Hyundai, Datsun/Nissan, Opel, Renault, Renault-Alpine, Saab, Mazda, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Talbot. With a further 11 having finished on the podium: Seat, Mini, Vauxhall, Alfa Romeo, Volvo, Ferrari, MG, Polski Fiat, Škoda, Triumph and Wartburg. Lancia, with ten Manufacturers&#x27; Championships, has won more championships than any other marque.

==Video games and esports==

There have been many video games based on the World Rally Championship, and due to lack of licenses, many more based on only certain cars, drivers or events. &quot;Sega Rally&quot;, released in 1995, as well as &quot;V-Rally&quot; and &quot;Top Gear Rally&quot; in 1997 were primarily arcade racing games with little emphasis on realistic damage or physics. The &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; series introduced in 1998 was the first to incorporate a more realistic simulation racing feel to the genre. &quot;Rally Trophy&quot;, released in 2001 for Microsoft Windows by Bugbear, concentrated on historic cars such as Alpine A110 and Lancia Stratos. &quot;RalliSport Challenge&quot;, released in 2002 for Windows and Xbox by Digital Illusions CE, featured classic Group B cars and hillclimb models along with modern WRC cars.

The first fully FIA licensed &quot;WRC: World Rally Championship&quot; was released in 2001 for PlayStation 2 by Evolution Studios. The video game series had its fifth game, &quot;&quot;, in 2005. Racing simulator &quot;Richard Burns Rally&quot;, released in 2004 for several platforms, has gathered recognition for its realism. Recent top-selling games include &quot;Colin McRae: DiRT 2&quot;, &quot;Sega Rally Revo&quot; and &quot;Dirt 3&quot;. &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; includes WRC licensed cars from manufacturers such as Subaru and Ford. In October 2010, Black Bean Games released &quot;&quot; which features the cars, drivers and events of the 2010 World Rally Championship, including those from the three support categories. A downloadable patch was produced allowing players to drive in Group B cars such as the Audi Quattro. Various cars whose participated in the WRC such as Mitsubishi Lancer WRC and Ford Fiesta RS WRC have also appeared in the Facebook game &quot;Car Town&quot;. The WRC video game license was acquired by French game development studio Kylotonn from Milestone srl after the release of &quot;WRC 4: FIA World Rally Championship&quot; in 2013. The first WRC game by Kylotonn was &quot;WRC 5&quot;, released in 2015, with successive releases on a near-annual basis with WRC Generations due in 2022. The WRC license will pass to Codemasters for the period of 2023 to 2027.

eSports WRC is an online championship run via the latest official video game. Beginning in 2016, the championship is free and open to anybody with a copy of the game. Each esports season ends with a Grand Finale with competitors gathering for an on-site event to race each other, usually in the service park of an actual rally event. Previous eSports WRC champion Jon Armstrong is also a physical rally driver, and racehouse Williams run a team.

<text>Maestro Ramón Martínez is an American master of classical and historical fencing. He studied classical fencing with the late Maître d&#x27;Armes Frederick Rohdes in New York City for ten years. Maître Rohdes was one of the last fencing masters to teach fencing as a martial art, himself having learned a variety of historical fencing systems from his own master, Maître d&#x27;Armes Marcel Cabijos. During that time Mr. Martínez became assistant and protégé of Maître Rohdes and was the only one of his pupils permitted to teach with full authorization at the Rohdes Academy.

In all, Maestro Ramon Martínez has devoted over 40 years to the study and teaching of classical fencing. He has also done extensive research in historical fencing. Many of the most prominent masters of the past centuries left elaborate, highly detailed treatises of the systems and styles which they taught. Ramon Martínez has spent years carefully and thoroughly researching these treatises in an effort to accurately reconstruct these varied styles. These ancient and historical forms are then taught as authentically as possible to those of his students who are interested. Ramon Martínez&#x27; goal is to teach, promote, and preserve this rare martial art.

Ramon Martínez is a past president of the Association for Historical Fencing (AHF), founded to promote, preserve and revive classical and historical fencing. He is also one of the founders of the International Masters at Arms Federation (IMAF).

Furthermore, Ramon Martínez is a researcher on the Spanish system of swordsmanship &quot;La Verdadera Destreza&quot;, codified throughout the historical period known as &quot;Siglo de Oro Español&quot;, having studied the old fencing techniques developed by such Masters as Don Jerónimo Sánchez de Carranza and Don Luis Pacheco de Narváez, among others.

He is recognized as a leading instructor in classical and historical fencing both in the U.S. and abroad, being considered a teacher on traditional fencing systems to other renowned members of the HEMA community, such as Cecil Longino, founder and head instructor of Academia della Spada in Seattle, Washington and Maestro Alberto Bomprezzi, founder and president of the Spanish Association for Historical Fencing (AEEA).

Ramon Martínez is a frequent instructor at the International Swordfighting and Martial Arts Convention (ISMAC), held in Detroit, Michigan every year. He is also a director of The Grand Assault of Arms, an annual open classical fencing tournament organized by the AHF in New York City.

<doc id="234248" wikidata="Q184659" url="?curid=234248" title="Maurice Wilkins">
<text>Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins (15 December 1916 – 5 October 2004) was a New Zealand-born British biophysicist and Nobel laureate whose research spanned multiple areas of physics and biophysics, contributing to the scientific understanding of phosphorescence, isotope separation, optical microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. He is known for his work at King&#x27;s College London on the structure of DNA.

Wilkins&#x27; work on DNA falls into two distinct phases. The first was in 1948–1950, when his initial studies produced the first clear X-ray images of DNA, which he presented at a conference in Naples in 1951 attended by James Watson. During the second phase, 1951–52, Wilkins produced clear &quot;B form&quot; X-shaped images from squid sperm, images he sent to James Watson and Francis Crick, causing Watson to write &quot;Wilkins... has obtained extremely excellent X-ray diffraction photographs&quot; [of DNA].

In 1953, Wilkins&#x27; group coordinator Sir John Randall instructed Raymond Gosling to hand over to Wilkins a high-quality image of &quot;B&quot; form DNA (&quot;Photo 51&quot;), which Gosling had made in 1952, after which his supervisor Rosalind Franklin &quot;put it aside&quot; as she was leaving King&#x27;s College London. Wilkins showed it to Watson. This image, along with the knowledge that Linus Pauling had proposed an incorrect structure of DNA, &quot;mobilised&quot; Watson and Crick to restart model building. With additional information from research reports of Wilkins and Franklin, obtained via Max Perutz, Watson and Crick correctly described the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953.

Wilkins continued to test, verify, and make significant corrections to the Watson–Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA. Wilkins, Crick, and Watson were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, &quot;for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Wilkins was born in Pongaroa, New Zealand, where his father, Edgar Henry Wilkins, was a medical doctor. His older sister was the translator and poet Eithne Wilkins. His family had come from Dublin, where his paternal and maternal grandfathers were, respectively, Headmaster of Dublin High School and a Chief of Police. The Wilkinses moved to Birmingham, England when Maurice was 6. Later, he attended Wylde Green College and then went to King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham from 1929 to 1934.

Wilkins went to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1935; he studied the Natural Sciences Tripos, specialising in Physics, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938. Mark Oliphant, who was one of Wilkins&#x27; instructors at St. John&#x27;s, had been appointed to the Chair of Physics at the University of Birmingham, and had appointed John Randall to his staff. Wilkins became a PhD student of Randall at the University of Birmingham. In 1945, they published four papers in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; on phosphorescence and electron traps. Wilkins received a PhD for this work in 1940.

==Career and research==
===Post war years: 1945–1950===
During World War II Wilkins developed improved radar screens at Birmingham, then worked on isotope separation at the Manhattan Project at the University of California, Berkeley during the years 1944–45.

Meanwhile, Randall had been appointed to the Chair of Physics at the University of St Andrews. In 1945, he appointed Wilkins as Assistant Lecturer in his department at the University of St Andrews. Randall was negotiating with the Medical Research Council (MRC) to set up a laboratory to apply the experimental methods of physics to problems of biology. The combination of these disciplines as biophysics was a novel idea. The MRC told Randall that this had to be done in another university. In 1946 Randall was appointed Wheatstone Professor of Physics, in charge of the entire Physics department at King&#x27;s College, London, with the funding to set up a Biophysics Unit. He brought Wilkins with him as Assistant Director of the unit. They appointed a team of scientists trained in both the physical and biological sciences. The &quot;management philosophy&quot; was to explore the use of many techniques in parallel, to find which looked promising, and then to focus on these. Wilkins, as the scientist with most diverse experience of physics and Assistant Director of the unit, had general oversight of the varied projects besides direct involvement in his personal research projects that included new types of optical microscopy. King&#x27;s College received funding to build completely new Physics and Engineering Departments where vaults beneath the Strand level College forecourt had been destroyed by bombs during the War. The Biophysics Unit, several more experimental physics groups and the theoretical group started to move in, during the early months of 1952. The laboratories were opened formally by Lord Cherwell on 27 June. Wilkins&#x27; article for &quot;Nature&quot; described both departments, consistent with his leadership role and prestige within the college at large.

===DNA – Phase One===

At King&#x27;s College, Wilkins pursued, among other things, X-ray diffraction work on ram sperm and DNA that had been obtained from calf thymus by the Swiss scientist Rudolf Signer. The DNA from Signer&#x27;s lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered that it was possible to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns. Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said &quot;When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment...we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize!&quot; This initial X-ray diffraction work at King&#x27;s College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked James Watson&#x27;s interest in DNA causing him to write &quot;suddenly I was excited about chemistry...I began to wonder whether it would be possible for me to join Wilkins in working on DNA&quot;. At that time Wilkins also introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins &quot;what you ought to do is find yourself a good protein&quot;. Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed Rosalind Franklin should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.

By the summer of 1950 Randall had arranged for a three-year research fellowship that would fund Rosalind Franklin in his laboratory. Franklin was delayed in finishing her work in Paris. Late in 1950, Randall wrote to Franklin to inform her that rather than work on protein, she should take advantage of Wilkins&#x27;s preliminary work and that she should do X-ray studies of DNA fibers made from Signer&#x27;s samples of DNA.

=== DNA Phase two 1951–52 ===

Early in 1951 Franklin finally arrived. Wilkins was away on holiday and missed an initial meeting at which Raymond Gosling stood in for him along with Alex Stokes, who, like Crick, would solve the basic mathematics that make possible a general theory of how helical structures diffract X-rays. No work had been done on DNA in the laboratory for several months; the new X-ray tube sat unused, waiting for Franklin. Franklin ended up with the DNA from Signer, Gosling became her PhD student, and she had the expectation that DNA X-ray diffraction work was her project. Wilkins returned to the laboratory expecting, on the other hand, that Franklin would be his collaborator and that they would work together on the DNA project that he had started. The confusion over Franklin&#x27;s and Wilkins&#x27; roles in relation to the DNA effort (which later developed into considerable tension between them) is clearly attributable to Randall. In his letter of appointment he told Franklin &quot;as far as the experimental X-ray effort [on DNA] is concerned, there will be at the moment only yourself and Gosling&quot;. However, Randall never informed Wilkins of his decision to give Franklin sole responsibility for the DNA effort and Wilkins only learned of the letter years after Franklin&#x27;s death. He later wrote &quot;My opinion is very clear: that Randall was very wrong to have written to Rosalind telling her that Stokes and I wished to stop our work on DNA, without consulting us. After Raymond [Gosling] and I got a clear crystalline X-ray pattern I was very eager to continue that work ... Trying to understand &#x27;what really happened&#x27; when a very admirable scientist [Randall] models himself on Napoleon is not easy ... [but the letter] was very damaging to her and to me&quot;.

By November 1951, Wilkins had evidence that DNA in cells as well as purified DNA had a helical structure. Alex Stokes had solved the basic mathematics of helical diffraction theory and thought that Wilkins&#x27;s X-ray diffraction data indicated a helical structure in DNA. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King&#x27;s College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing the model of the proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick that it was wrong. Franklin based this on two observations. First, experiments by J.M. Gulland showed that the CO- and NH2 groups of the bases could not be titrated, and so were probably inaccessible. Secondly, crystallographic evidence showed that the structural units of DNA were progressively separated by the addition of water, leading to the formation of a gel and then a solution. Franklin believed that the simplest explanation of this was for the hydrophilic part of the molecule to be on the outside. Crick tried to get Wilkins to continue with additional molecular modeling efforts, but Wilkins did not take this approach.

Early in 1952, Wilkins began a series of experiments on sepia sperm which were very encouraging. &quot;I...got much clearer patterns than the previous year...when I met [Sir William Lawrence] Bragg by chance I showed him the pattern [which] very clearly offered strong evidence for a helical structure for DNA...the sharp sperm patterns were very inspiring, and had the special interest that sperm were real live objects and not just purified DNA extracted by chemists from living material&quot;. Wilkins was particularly interested in whether living samples would yield meaningful X-ray diffraction patterns – his results showed they could.

During 1952, Franklin also refused to participate in molecular modeling efforts and continued to work on step-by-step detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data (Patterson synthesis). By the spring of 1952, Franklin had received permission from Randall to ask to transfer her fellowship so that she could leave King&#x27;s College and work in John Bernal&#x27;s laboratory at Birkbeck College, also in London. Franklin remained at King&#x27;s College until the middle of March 1953.

Linus Pauling had published a proposed but incorrect structure of DNA, making the same basic error that Watson and Crick had made a year earlier. Some of those working on DNA in the United Kingdom feared that Pauling would quickly solve the DNA structure once he recognized his error and put the backbones of the nucleotide chains on the outside of a model of DNA. After March 1952 Franklin concentrated on the X-ray data for the A-form of less hydrated DNA while Wilkins tried to work on the hydrated B-form. Wilkins was handicapped because Franklin had all of the good DNA. Wilkins got new DNA samples, but it was not as good as the original sample he had obtained in 1950 and which Franklin continued to use. Most of his new results were for biological samples like sperm cells, which also suggested a helical structure for DNA. In July 1952 Franklin reported to him and Stokes that her newest results made her doubt the helical nature of the A-form.

In early 1953 Watson visited King&#x27;s College and Wilkins showed him a high quality image of the B-form X-ray diffraction pattern, now identified as photograph 51, that Franklin had produced in March 1952. Wilkins had shown this image produced by Franklin without notifying or receiving authorization from the principal investigator who produced the image. With the knowledge that Pauling was working on DNA and had submitted a model of DNA for publication, Watson and Crick mounted one more concentrated effort to deduce the structure of DNA. Through Max Perutz, his thesis supervisor, Crick gained access to a progress report from King&#x27;s College that included useful information from Franklin about the features of DNA she had deduced from her X-ray diffraction data. Watson and Crick published their proposed DNA double helical structure in a paper in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in April 1953. In this paper Watson and Crick acknowledged that they had been &quot;stimulated by... the unpublished results and ideas&quot; of Wilkins and Franklin.

The first Watson-Crick paper appeared in &quot;Nature&quot; on 25 April 1953. The members of the Cambridge and King&#x27;s College laboratories agreed to report their interlocking work in three papers with continuous pagination in &quot;Nature&quot;.

Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, where Watson and Crick worked, gave a talk at Guy&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday 14 May 1953 which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; of London, on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled &quot;Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life.&quot; The news reached readers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; the next day; Victor K. McElheny, in researching his biography of Watson, &quot;Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution&quot;, found a clipping of a six-paragraph &quot;New York Times&quot; article written from London and dated 16 May 1953 with the headline &quot;Form of &#x27;Life Unit&#x27; in Cell Is Scanned.&quot; The article ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important. (The &quot;New York Times&quot; subsequently ran a longer article on 12 June 1953). The Cambridge University undergraduate newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot; also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday 30 May 1953. Bragg&#x27;s original announcement at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953 went unreported by the press.

===Post-1953===
Following the initial 1953 series of publications on the double helix structure of DNA, Wilkins continued research as leader of a team that performed a range of meticulous experiments to establish the helical model as valid among different biological species, as well as in living systems, to establish the universality of the double helix structure. He became deputy director of the MRC Biophysics Unit at King&#x27;s in 1955, and succeeded Randall as director of the unit from 1970 to 1972.

===Awards and honours===

Wilkins was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1959 and an EMBO Member in 1964.

In 1960 he was presented with the American Public Health Association&#x27;s Albert Lasker Award, and in 1962 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Also in 1962 he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Watson and Crick for the discovery of the structure of DNA.

From 1969 to 1991, Wilkins was the founding President of the &quot;British Society for Social Responsibility in Science&quot;.

In 2000, King&#x27;s College London opened the &quot;Franklin-Wilkins Building&quot; in honour of Dr. Franklin&#x27;s and Professor Wilkins&#x27; work at the college.

The wording on the DNA sculpture (donated by James Watson) outside Clare College&#x27;s Thirkill Court, Cambridge, England is

a) on the base:
:i) &quot;These strands unravel during cell reproduction. Genes are encoded in the sequence of bases.&quot;
:ii) &quot;The double helix model was supported by the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins.&quot;

b) on the helices:
:i) &quot;The structure of DNA was discovered in 1953 by Francis Crick and James Watson while Watson lived here at Clare.&quot;
:ii) &quot;The molecule of DNA has two helical strands that are linked by base pairs Adenine – Thymine or Guanine – Cytosine.&quot;

The Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery at the University of Auckland, launched in 2002, was renamed the Maurice Wilkins Centre in 2006.

==Personal life==
Wilkins was married twice. His first wife, Ruth, was an art student whom he met whilst he was at Berkeley. Their marriage ended in divorce, and Ruth bore her son by Wilkins after their divorce. Wilkins married his second wife Patricia Ann Chidgey in 1959. They had four children, Sarah, George, Emily and William. His widow Patricia and the children from their marriage survived him.

In the years before World War II, he was an anti-war activist, joining the Cambridge Scientists&#x27; Anti-War Group. He joined the Communist Party, until the invasion of Poland by the Soviet Army in September 1939. Formerly classified UK security service papers reveal that Wilkins came under suspicion of leaking atomic secrets. The files, released in August 2010, indicate surveillance of Wilkins ended by 1953. &quot;After the war I wondered what I would do, as I was very disgusted with the dropping of two bombs on civilian centres in Japan,&quot; he told Britain&#x27;s &quot;Encounter&quot; radio program in 1999.

Wilkins published his autobiography, &quot;The Third Man of the Double Helix&quot;, in 2003.

<text>Aulus Persius Flaccus (; 4 December 3424 November 62 AD) was a Roman poet and satirist of Etruscan origin. In his works, poems and satire, he shows a Stoic wisdom and a strong criticism for what he considered to be the stylistic abuses of his poetic contemporaries. His works, which became very popular in the Middle Ages, were published after his death by his friend and mentor, the Stoic philosopher Lucius Annaeus Cornutus.

==Life==
According to the &quot;Life&quot; contained in the manuscripts, Persius was born into an equestrian family at Volterra (Volaterrae, in Latin), a small Etruscan city in the province of Pisa, of good stock on both parents&#x27; side. When he was six years old he lost his father; his stepfather died a few years later. At the age of twelve Persius came to Rome, where he was taught by Remmius Palaemon and the rhetor Verginius Flavus. During the next four years he developed friendships with the Stoic Lucius Annaeus Cornutus, the lyric poet Caesius Bassus and the poet Lucan. Lucan would become a generous admirer of all Persius wrote. He also became close friends with Thrasea Paetus, the husband of Arria, a relative of Persius&#x27;s; over the next ten years Persius and Thrasea Paetus shared many travels together. Later, he met Seneca, but was not impressed by his genius.

In his boyhood, Persius wrote a tragedy dealing with an episode in Roman history, and another work, probably on travel (although this would have been before the travels with Thrasea Paetus). Reading the satires of Lucilius made Persius want to write like him, and he set to work on a book of his own satires. But he wrote seldom and slowly; a premature death (&quot;uitio stomachi&quot;) prevented him from completing the book. He has been described as having &quot;a gentle disposition, girlish modesty and personal beauty&quot;, and is said to have lived a life of exemplary devotion towards his mother Fulvia Sisennia, his sister and his aunt. To his mother and sister he left his considerable fortune. Cornutus suppressed all his work except the satires, to which he made some slight alterations before handing it over to Bassus for editing. It proved an immediate success.

===Doubts over his biography===

The &quot;scholia&quot; add a few details—on what authority is, as generally with such sources, very doubtful. The &quot;Life&quot; itself, though not free from the suspicion of interpolation and undoubtedly corrupt and disordered in places, is probably trustworthy. The manuscripts say it came from the commentary of Valerius Probus, no doubt a learned edition of Persius like those of Virgil and Horace by this same famous &quot;grammarian&quot; of Berytus, the poet&#x27;s contemporary. The only case in which it seems to conflict with the &quot;Satires&quot; () themselves is in its statement as to the death of Persius&#x27;s father. The declaiming of a &quot;suasoria&quot; in his presence (Sat. 3.4 sqq.) implies a more mature age than that of six in the performer. But &quot;pater&quot; might here mean &quot;stepfather,&quot; or Persius may have forgotten his own autobiography, may be simply reproducing one of his models. The mere fact that the &quot;Life&quot; and the &quot;Satires&quot; agree so closely does not of course prove the authenticity of the former. One of the points of harmony is, however, too subtle for us to believe that a forger evolved it from the works of Persius: the &quot;Life&quot; gives the impression of a &quot;bookish&quot; youth, who never strayed far from home and family. This is also the picture drawn by the &quot;Satires&quot;; many of the characters that Persius creates have the same names as characters found in Horace.

A keen observer of what occurs within his narrow horizon, Persius did not shy away from describing the seamy side of life (cf. e.g. such hints as &quot;Sat.&quot; iii.110), especially the relationship between excesses of consumption and moral failure; he shows little of Horace&#x27;s easy-going acceptance of human weaknesses. Perhaps the sensitive, homebred nature of Persius can also be glimpsed in his frequent references to ridicule, whether of great men by street gamins or of the cultured by philistines. Montaigne mentions Persius several times.

==Work==

The chief interest of Persius&#x27;s work lies in its relation to Roman satire in its interpretation of Roman Stoicism, and in its use of the Latin tongue. The influence of Horace on Persius can, in spite of the silence of the &quot;Life,&quot; hardly have been less than that of Lucilius. Not only characters, as noted above, but whole phrases, thoughts and situations come directly from him. The resemblance only emphasizes the difference between the caricaturist of Stoicism and its preacher. Persius strikes the highest note that Roman satire reached; in earnestness and moral purpose he rises far superior to the political rancour or good-natured persiflage of his predecessors and the rhetorical indignation of Juvenal. From him we learn how that philosophy could work on minds that still preserved the depth and purity of the old Roman &quot;gravitas.&quot; Some of the parallel passages in the works of Persius and Seneca are very close, and cannot be explained by assuming the use of a common source. Like Seneca, Persius censures the style of the day, and imitates it. Indeed, in some of its worst failings, straining of expression, excess of detail, exaggeration, he outbids Seneca, whilst the obscurity, which makes his little book of not seven hundred lines so difficult to read and is in no way due to great depth of thought, compares poorly with the terse clearness of the &quot;Epistolae morales&quot;. A curious contrast to this tendency is presented by his free use of &quot;popular&quot; words. As of Plato, so of Persius, we hear that he emulated Sophron; the authority is a late one (the Byzantine Lydus, &quot;De mag.&quot; I.41), but we can at least recognize in the scene that opens &quot;Sat.&quot; 3 kinship with such work as Theocritus&#x27; &quot;Adoniazusae&quot; and the &quot;Mimes&quot; of Herodas.

Persius&#x27;s satires are composed in hexameters, except for the scazons of the short prologue above referred to. The first satire censures the literary tastes of the day as a reflection of the decadence of the national morals. The theme of Seneca&#x27;s 114th letter is similar. The description of the recitator and the literary twaddlers after dinner is vividly natural, but an interesting passage which cites specimens of smooth versification and the languishing style is greatly spoiled by the difficulty of appreciating the points involved and indeed of distributing the dialogue (a not uncommon crux in Persius). The remaining satires handle in order (2) the question as to what we may justly ask of the gods (cf. &quot;Second Alcibiades&quot;), (3) the importance of having a definite aim in life, (4) the necessity of self-knowledge for public men (cf. Plato&#x27;s &quot;First Alcibiades&quot;), (5) the Stoic doctrine of liberty (introduced by generous allusions to Cornutus&#x27; teaching), and (6) the proper use of money.

The &quot;Life&quot; tells us that the &quot;Satires&quot; were not left complete; some lines were taken (presumably by Cornutus or Bassus) from the end of the work so that it might be &quot;quasi finitus.&quot; This perhaps means that a sentence in which Persius had left a line imperfect, or a paragraph which he had not completed, had to be omitted. The same authority says that Cornutus definitely blacked out an offensive allusion to the emperor&#x27;s literary taste, and that we owe to him the reading of the manuscripts in Sat. i.121,—&quot;&quot;auriculas asini &quot;quis non&quot; (for &quot;Mida rex&quot; ) habet!&quot;&quot; Traces of lack of revision are, however, still visible; cf. e.g. v.176 (sudden transition from ambition to superstition) and vi.37 (where criticism of Greek &quot;doctores&quot; has nothing to do with the context). The parallels to passages of Horace and Seneca are recorded in the commentaries: in view of what the &quot;Life&quot; says about Lucan, the verbal resemblance of &quot;Sat.&quot; iii.3 to &quot;Phars.&quot; x.163 is interesting. Examples of bold language or metaphor: i.25, &quot;rupto iecore exierit caprificus,&quot; 60, &quot;linguae quantum sitiat canis&quot;; iii.42, &quot;intus palleat,&quot; 81, &quot;silentia rodunt&quot;; v.92, &quot;ueteres auiae de pulmone reuello.&quot; Passages like iii.87, 100 sqq. show elaboration carried beyond the rules of good taste. &quot;Popular&quot; words: &quot;baro&quot;, &quot;cerdo&quot;, &quot;ebullire&quot;, &quot;glutto&quot;, &quot;lallare&quot;, &quot;mamma&quot;, &quot;muttire&quot;, &quot;obba&quot;, &quot;palpo&quot;, &quot;scloppus&quot;. Fine lines, etc., in i.116 sqq., ii.6 sqq., 61 sqq., 73 sqq., iii.39 sqq.

===Authorities===
The manuscripts of Persius fall into two groups, one represented by two of the best of them, the other by that of Petrus Pithoeus, so important for the text of Juvenal. Since the publication of J. Bieger&#x27;s &quot;de Persii cod. pith. recte aestimando&quot; (Berlin, 1890) the tendency has been to prefer the tradition of the latter.

The first important editions were: (1) with explanatory notes: Isaac Casaubon (Paris, 1605, enlarged edition by Johann Friedrich Dübner, Leipzig, 1833); Otto Jahn (with the &quot;scholia&quot; and valuable &quot;prolegomena,&quot; Leipzig, 1843); John Conington (with translation; 3rd ed., Oxford, 1893), etc.; but there are several modern editions.

<doc id="234251" wikidata="Q112025" url="?curid=234251" title="Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū">
<text>is one of the oldest extant Japanese martial arts and an exemplar of &quot;bujutsu&quot;. It was founded by Iizasa Ienao, who lived near Katori Shrine (Sawara City, Chiba Prefecture) at the time. The &quot;ryū&quot; is purported to have been founded in 1447, but some scholars state that it was about 1480.

==History==
===Foundation===

Iizasa Ienao (飯篠 長威斎 家直 &quot;Iizasa Chōi-sai Ienao&quot;, 1387 – c. 1488) was a respected spearman and swordsman whose &quot;daimyō&quot; was deposed, which encouraged him to relinquish control of his household to conduct purification rituals and study martial arts in isolation.

Iizasa was born in the village of Iizasa in Shimōsa Province. When he was young, he moved to the vicinity of the famous Katori Shrine, northeast of Tokyo in modern-day Chiba Prefecture. The shrine&#x27;s &quot;kami&quot;, Futsunushi () is revered as a spirit of swordsmanship and martial arts.

===Headmasters===
In 1896, the 18th &quot;sōke&quot; died without a male heir. &quot;Shihan&quot; Yamaguchi Eikan governed the school until his death on 14 March 1917. Until Iizasa Kinjiro married into the Iizasa household, the school was headed in order by nine instructors—Tamai Kisaburo, Shiina Ichizo, Ito Tanekichi, Kuboki Sazaemon, Isobe Kohei, Motomiya (Hongu) Toranosuke, Hayashi Yazaemon, Kamagata Minosuke, and the main instructor Yamaguchi.

===Recent history===
On 6 March 1960, the school received the first ever &quot;Intangible Cultural Asset&quot; designation given to a martial art by the Japanese government, naming Hayashi Yazaemon, Ōtake Risuke, and Iizasa Yasusada as its guardians. The Iizasa family dojo was also designated a Cultural Asset. The designation of Cultural Asset status shifted to the Chiba Prefectural Government in 1985 and the art was recertified, again naming Ōtake Risuke and Iizasa Yasusada as guardians. Ōtake Nobutoshi and Kyōsō Shigetoshi were also certified as guardians on 30 March 2004.

Iizasa Yasusada has publicly recognised the Otake and Sugino dojo. Both dojo represent the school annually at the Meiji Jingu embu.

Kyōsō Shigetoshi was appointed shihan in September 2017, and Ōtake Nobutoshi was issued hamon (excommunicated) on 9 December 2018. However, both Otake Risuke, Otake Nobutoshi and Kyōsō Shigetoshi are still recognised as guardians of the school, by the Chiba Prefecture Board of Cultural Affairs.

== Curriculum ==

The Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū is a comprehensive martial system. Unlike modern martial arts such as kendo or &quot;iaido&quot;, which concentrate on one specific area of training, a broad range of martial skills is studied.

The main emphasis of the school is &quot;kenjutsu&quot;. A wide range of other weapons are taught as part of the curriculum, but the sword remains the central weapon.

The primary curriculum includes:

The Gogyo and Gokui kata are only taught to advanced practitioners after years of fundamental practice.

Other, more advanced areas of study of the school include:
*&quot;Ninjutsu&quot; (intelligence gathering and analysis)
*&quot;Chikujojutsu&quot; (field fortification art)
*&quot;Gunbai-Heihō&quot; (strategy and tactics)
*&quot;Tenmon Chirigaku&quot; (Chinese astrology and geomantic divination)
*&quot;In-Yo kigaku&quot; (philosophical and mystical aspects derived from Mikkyō, specifically Shingon Buddhism)

==Keppan==

Historically, before beginning any training in Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū, every prospective pupil had to swear an oath of allegiance to the school. The method was to make &quot;keppan&quot; (blood oath) in support of the following &quot;kisho&quot; or &quot;kishomon&quot; (pledge). This oath was a written one with the prospective member being required to sign his name in his own blood. The applicant would prick or cut a finger or sometimes the inner arm and with the blood drawn, sign the following pledge:
On becoming a member of the Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū which has been transmitted by the Great Deity of the Katori Shrine, I herewith affirm my pledge that:
#I will not have the impertinence to discuss or demonstrate details of the &quot;ryū&quot; to either non-members or members, even if they are relatives;
#I will not engage in altercations or misuse the art against others;
#I will never engage in any kind of gambling nor frequent disreputable places.
#I will not cross swords with any followers of other martial traditions without authorization.
I hereby pledge to firmly adhere to each of the above articles. Should I break any of these articles I will submit to the punishment of the Great Deity of Katori and the Great Deity Marishiten. Herewith I solemnly swear and affix my blood seal to this oath to these Great Deities.
==Branches==
Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū is currently represented by the Kyōsō Shibu led by Kyōsō Shigetoshi, Ōtake Risuke&#x27;s younger son. The honbu dojo is located at Iizasa Yasusada&#x27;s home near the Katori shrine and is used by branches in good standing on special occasions. The Kyōsō Shibu regularly trains out of the Shisui Town Community Plaza and the Matsuyamashita Koen Sports Gymnasium in Inzai City. Several branches have existed alongside or split from the mainline with varying ties to the Iizasa family, such as Noda, Yoseikan, Shinbukan, Sugino, Hatakeyama, Sugawara.

==Ranking and appointed positions==
The different branches recognize different levels of ranks and appointments. The traditional ranks are a variant of the &quot;menkyo&quot; system.

===Ōtake===
====Ranks====
* Mokuroku (目録, &quot;catalog&quot;)
* Menkyo (免許, &quot;license, certificate&quot;)
* Gokui Kaiden (極意皆伝, &quot;deepest transmission&quot;)

====Appointments====
* Shidōsha (指導者, &quot;mentor, coach&quot;; given as license to teach outside of Shinbukan dojo)
* Shihan (師範, &#x27;instructor&#x27;; head-teacher)

===Sugino Dojo===
The Sugino line uses the modern dan system, out of respect for Yoshio Sugino&#x27;s (10th dan) judo teacher Kanō Jigorō, who was a pioneer of the dan-i ranking system.
Sugino dojo members also receive densho/makimono.

===Hatakeyama-ha===
The Hatakeyama line (which has no current headmaster) uses the modern dan system alongside the traditional &quot;menkyo&quot; system, issuing ranks in both with shōden/chūden/okuden gradations to create equivalent ranks from the &quot;menkyo&quot; system.

====Ranks====
*1st dan – kirikami shōden 
*2nd dan – kirikami chūden
*3rd dan – mokuroku shōden
*4th dan – mokuroku chūden
*5th dan – menkyo mokuroku
*6th dan – menkyo chūden
*7th dan – menkyo okuden
*8th dan – menkyo kaiden

===Sugawara-ha===
Sugawara Sogo Budo issues &quot;mokuroku&quot; and &quot;menkyo&quot; certifications. The highest level is menkyo kaiden. English-speaking members of Sugawara Budo refer to the rank of menkyo as a &quot;&quot;kyōshi&quot; license&quot; or &quot;menkyo kyōshi&quot;.

===Noda-ha===
Noda Shinzan (1848–1917) began training in Katori Shintō-ryū in 1853 under Yamada Naomune, a retainer of the Date clan. Many Date retainers had trained in Katori Shintō-ryū and developed their own distinctive style. After Naomune&#x27;s death in 1912, Shinzan enrolled his grandson, Seizan, under Yamaguchi Kumajiro, the most senior mainline shihan at the time. Following the deaths of Yamaguchi and his grandfather, Noda Seizan continued to train under Motomiya Toranosuke. After Motomiya&#x27;s passing, Noda studied with Hayashi Yazaemon who began reforming and standardizing the mainline curriculum. Finding his style incompatible with Hayashi&#x27;s, Noda Seizan quietly withdrew to private teaching, referring to his branch as Noda-ha Katori Shintō-ryū. Noda-ha preserves some kata that have been lost in the mainline.

===Ichigidō===
Shiigi Munenori began training in Katori Shintō-ryū under his father, who had trained with Motomiya Toranosuke, before formally training at Ōtake Risuke&#x27;s dojo for over thirty years. He incorporates Katori Shintō-ryū as part of the curriculum of his Ichigidō organization and maintains a positive relationship with the Iizasa family. He writes &quot;Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū&quot; as &quot;天真正伝香取神刀流&quot; using &#x27;刀&#x27; (sword) in place of &#x27;道&#x27; (way).

===Yoseikan Budo===
Mochizuki Minoru, a judoka from the Kodokan who trained alongside Sugino Yoshio, has incorporated Katori Shintō-ryū into the curriculum of Yoseikan Budo. His son, Mochizuki Hiro, now heads Yoseikan.

<text>Gaius Caesius Bassus (d. AD 79) was a Roman lyric poet who lived in the reign of Nero.

He was the intimate friend of Persius, who dedicated his sixth satire to him, and whose works he edited (&quot;Schol. on Persius&quot;, vi. I). He had a great reputation as a poet; Quintilian (&quot;Instit.&quot; x. I. 96) went so far as to say that with the exception of Horace, he was the only lyric poet worth reading.

He is also identified with the author of a treatise &quot;De Metris&quot; of which considerable fragments, probably of an abbreviated edition, are extant (ed. Keil, 1885). The work was probably originally in verse, and afterwards recast or epitomized in prose form to be used as an instruction book. An account of some of the metres of Horace (in Keil, &quot;Grammatici Latini&quot;, vi. 305), bearing the title &quot;Ars Caesii Bassi de Metris&quot; is not by him but chiefly borrowed by its unknown author, from the treatise mentioned above.

He is said to have lost his life in the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.

<text>Quintus Remmius Palaemon or Quintus Rhemnius Fannius Palaemon was a Roman grammarian and a native of Vicentia. He lived during the reigns of Emperors Tiberius and Claudius.

== Life ==
From Suetonius, we learn that he was originally a slave who obtained his freedom and taught grammar at Rome. Suetonius preserves several anecdotes of his profligate and arrogant character. He was said to be so steeped in luxury that he bathed several times a day. Tiberius and Claudius both felt he was too dissolute to allow boys and young men to be entrusted to him. He referred to the great grammarian Varro as a &quot;pig&quot;. However, he had a remarkable memory and wrote poetry in unusual meters, and he enjoyed a great reputation as a teacher; Quintilian and Persius are said to have been his pupils.

==Works==
His lost &quot;Ars&quot;, a system of grammar much used in his own time and largely drawn upon by later grammarians, contained rules for correct diction, illustrative quotations and discussed barbarisms and solecisms. An extant &quot;Ars grammatica&quot; (discovered by Jovianus Pontanus in the 15th century) and other unimportant treatises on similar subjects have been wrongly ascribed to him.

Among Palaemon&#x27;s ascribed works is a &quot;Song on Weights and Measures&quot; (&quot;&quot;) now dated to between the late 4th and early 6th centuries. In this poem, first edited in 1528, the term &quot;gramma&quot; is used for a weight equal to two oboli. (Two oboli—a &quot;diobol&quot;—corresponds to 1/24th of a Roman ounce or about 1.14 grams.) This eventually led to the adoption of the term &quot;gram&quot; as a unit of weight (&quot;poids&quot;, later of mass) by the French National Convention in 1795.
