<text>Leonard Sidney Woolf (; – ) was a British political theorist, author, publisher, and civil servant. He was married to author Virginia Woolf. As a member of the Labour Party and the Fabian Society, Woolf was an avid publisher of his own work and his wife&#x27;s novels. A writer himself, Woolf created nineteen individual works and wrote six autobiographies. Leonard and Virginia did not have any children.

==Early life==

Woolf was born in London in 1880 the third of ten children of Solomon Rees Sidney Woolf (known as Sidney Woolf), a barrister and Queen&#x27;s Counsel, and Marie (née de Jongh). His family was Jewish. After his father died in 1892, Woolf was sent to board at Arlington House School near Brighton, Sussex. From 1894 to 1899, he attended St Paul&#x27;s School, and in 1899 he won a classical scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected to the Cambridge Apostles. Other contemporary members included Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes, G. E. Moore, and E. M. Forster. Thoby Stephen (his future wife&#x27;s brother) was friendly with the Apostles, though not a member himself. Woolf was awarded his BA in 1902 but stayed there for another year to study for the Civil Service examinations held then.

In October 1904, Woolf moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to become a cadet in the Ceylon Civil Service, in Jaffna and later Kandy, and by August 1908 was named an assistant government agent in the Southern Province, where he administered the District of Hambantota. Woolf returned to England in May 1911 for a year&#x27;s leave. Instead, however, he resigned in early 1912 and that same year married Virginia Stephen.

Leonard and Virginia Woolf lived at 17 The Green, Richmond upon Thames, starting from October 1914. In early March 1915, the couple moved to nearby Hogarth House, Paradise Road.

In 1919, the Woolfs purchased the Round House in Pipe Passage, Lewes, East Sussex. The same year, they discovered Monk&#x27;s House in nearby Rodmell, which both she and Leonard favoured because of its orchard and garden. She then bought Monk&#x27;s House and sold the Round House.

Together, Leonard and Virginia Woolf became influential in the Bloomsbury Group, which also included various other former Apostles.

In December 1917, Woolf became one of the co-founders of the 1917 Club, which met in Gerrard Street, Soho.

==Writing==
After marriage, Woolf turned to writing and published his first novel, &quot;The Village in the Jungle&quot; (1913), which is based on his years in Ceylon. A series of books followed at roughly bi-annual intervals.

On the introduction of conscription in 1916, during the First World War, Woolf was rejected for military service on medical grounds and turned to politics and sociology. He joined the Labour Party and the Fabian Society, and became a regular contributor to the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. In 1916, he wrote &quot;International Government&quot;, proposing an international agency to enforce world peace. He stood as the Labour candidate for the Combined English Universities in 1922.

As his wife&#x27;s mental health worsened, Woolf devoted much of his time to caring for her (he himself suffered from depression). In 1917, the Woolfs bought a small hand-operated printing press and with it, they founded the Hogarth Press. Their first project was a pamphlet, hand-printed and bound by themselves. Within ten years the Press had become a full-scale publishing house, issuing Virginia&#x27;s novels, Leonard&#x27;s tracts and, among other works, the first edition of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. Woolf continued as the main director of the Press until his death. His wife suffered from severe bouts of mental illness throughout her life, until her suicide by drowning in 1941. Later, Leonard fell in love with a married artist, Trekkie Parsons.

In 1919, Woolf became editor of the &quot;International Review&quot;. He also edited the international section of the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot; from 1920 to 1922. He was literary editor of &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot; (generally referred to simply as &quot;The Nation&quot;) from 1923 to 1930, and joint founder and editor of &quot;The Political Quarterly&quot; from 1931 to 1959, and for a time he served as secretary of the Labour Party&#x27;s advisory committees on international and colonial questions.




In 1960, Woolf revisited Ceylon and was surprised at the warmth of the welcome he received, and even the fact that he was still remembered. Woolf accepted an honorary doctorate from the then-new University of Sussex in 1964 and in 1965 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He declined the offer of Companion of Honour (CH) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list in 1966.

==Family==
Among his nine siblings, Bella Woolf was also an author. His brother Cecil Nathan Sidney Woolf was the author of &quot;Poems&quot; (published 1918); Cecil was killed in World War I in 1917. His dissertation &quot;Bartolus of Sassoferrato, his Position in the History of Medieval Political Thought&quot; was expanded to a book published by Cambridge University Press in 1913 in collaboration with his brother Philip. Philip and Cecil also translated Stendhal&#x27;s &quot;On Love&quot; (Duckworth, 1915).

==Death==
Woolf died on 14 August 1969 from a stroke. He was cremated and his ashes were buried alongside his wife&#x27;s beneath an elm tree in his beloved garden at Monk&#x27;s House, Rodmell, Sussex. The tree subsequently blew down and Woolf&#x27;s remains have since been marked by a bronze bust.

His papers are held by the University of Sussex at the Falmer campus.

<doc id="238118" wikidata="Q584564" url="?curid=238118" title="Spotted dick">
<text>Spotted dick is a traditional British steamed pudding, historically made with suet and dried fruit (usually currants or raisins) and often served with custard. 

Non-traditional variants include recipes that replace suet with other fats (such as butter), or that include eggs to make something similar to a sponge pudding or cake.

==Etymology==
&quot;Spotted&quot; is a reference to the dried fruit in the pudding (which resembles spots). The word &quot;dick&quot; refers to pudding. In late 19th century Huddersfield, for instance, a glossary of local terms stated: &quot;&quot;Dick&quot;, plain pudding. If with treacle sauce, treacle dick.&quot; This sense of &quot;dick&quot; may be related to the word &quot;dough&quot;. In the variant name &quot;spotted dog&quot;, &quot;dog&quot; is a variant form of &quot;dough&quot;.

==History==
The dish is first attested in Alexis Soyer&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère&quot;, published in 1849, in which he described a recipe for &quot;Plum Bolster, or Spotted DickRoll out two pounds of paste[...] have some Smyrna raisins well washed&quot;.

The name &quot;spotted dog&quot; first appeared in 1855, in C.M. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Working-men&#x27;s Way in the World&quot; where it was described as a &quot;very marly species of plum-pudding&quot;. This name, along with &quot;railway cake&quot;, is most common in Ireland where it is made more similar to a soda bread loaf with the addition of currants.

The &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; reported in 1892 that &quot;the Kilburn Sisters[...] daily satisfied hundreds of dockers with soup and Spotted Dick&quot;.

The name has long been a source of amusement and double entendres; reportedly restaurant staff in the Houses of Parliament decided to rename it &quot;Spotted Richard&quot; so it was &quot;less likely to cause a stir&quot;.

<doc id="238122" wikidata="Q379885" url="?curid=238122" title="Potassium carbonate">
<text>Potassium carbonate is the inorganic compound with the formula . It is a white salt, which is soluble in water and forms a strongly alkaline solution. It is deliquescent, often appearing as a damp or wet solid. Potassium carbonate is mainly used in the production of soap and glass. Commonly, it can be found as the result of leakage of alkaline batteries. Potassium carbonate is a potassium salt of carbonic acid. This salt consists of potassium cations and carbonate anions , and is therefore an alkali metal carbonate.

==History==

Potassium carbonate is the primary component of potash and the more refined pearl ash or salt of tartar. Historically, pearl ash was created by baking potash in a kiln to remove impurities. The fine, white powder remaining was the pearl ash. The first patent issued by the US Patent Office was awarded to Samuel Hopkins in 1790 for an improved method of making potash and pearl ash.

In late 18th-century North America, before the development of baking powder, pearl ash was used as a leavening agent for quick breads.

==Production==
The modern commercial production of potassium carbonate is by reaction of potassium hydroxide with carbon dioxide:
From the solution crystallizes the sesquihydrate (&quot;potash hydrate&quot;). Heating this solid above gives the anhydrous salt. In an alternative method, potassium chloride is treated with carbon dioxide in the presence of an organic amine to give potassium bicarbonate, which is then calcined:

==Applications==
* (historically) for soap, glass, and dishware production;
* as a dietary potassium supplement, containing 56% of elemental potassium, in tablet or powder form to address low blood potassium levels caused by inadequate nourishment, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or potassium-depleting medications such as corticosteroids or diuretics;
* as a mild drying agent where other drying agents, such as calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate, may be incompatible. It is not suitable for acidic compounds, but can be useful for drying an organic phase if one has a small amount of acidic impurity. It may also be used to dry some ketones; alcohols, and amines prior to distillation.
* in cuisine, where it has many traditional uses. It is used in some types of Chinese noodles and mooncakes, as well as Asian grass jelly and Japanese ramen. German gingerbread recipes often use potassium carbonate as a baking agent, although in combination with hartshorn; 
* in the alkalization of cocoa powder to produce Dutch process chocolate by balancing the pH (i.e., reduce the acidity) of natural cocoa beans; it also enhances aromathe process of adding potassium carbonate to cocoa powder is usually called &quot;Dutching&quot; (and the products referred to as Dutch-processed cocoa powder), as the process was first developed in 1828 by Dutchman Coenraad Johannes van Houten;
* as a buffering agent in the production of mead or wine;
* in antique documents, it is reported to have been used to soften hard water;
* as a fire suppressant in extinguishing deep-fat fryers and various other B class-related fires;
* in condensed aerosol fire suppression, although as the byproduct of potassium nitrate;
* as an ingredient in welding fluxes, and in the flux coating on arc-welding rods;
* as an animal feed ingredient to satisfy the potassium requirements of farmed animals such as broiler breeder chickens;
* as an acidity regulator in Swedish &quot;snus&quot; snuff tobacco.

<text>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body, blocking small blood vessels. Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain, problems speaking, or problems moving parts of the body. As clotting factors and platelets are used up, bleeding may occur. This may include blood in the urine, blood in the stool, or bleeding into the skin. Complications may include organ failure.
Relatively common causes include sepsis, surgery, major trauma, cancer, and complications of pregnancy. Less common causes include snake bites, frostbite, and burns. There are two main types: acute (rapid onset) and chronic (slow onset). Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests. Findings may include low platelets, low fibrinogen, high INR, or high D-dimer.
Treatment is mainly directed towards the underlying condition. Other measures may include giving platelets, cryoprecipitate, or fresh frozen plasma. Evidence to support these treatments, however, is poor. Heparin may be useful in the slowly developing form. About 1% of people admitted to hospital are affected by the condition. In those with sepsis, rates are between 20% and 50%. The risk of death among those affected varies from 20% to 50%.

==Signs and symptoms==
In DIC, the underlying cause usually leads to symptoms and signs, and DIC is discovered on laboratory testing. The onset of DIC can be sudden, as in endotoxic shock or amniotic fluid embolism, or it may be insidious and chronic, as in cancer. DIC can lead to multiorgan failure and widespread bleeding.

==Causes==
DIC can occur in the following conditions:
* Cancer: solid tumors and blood cancers (particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia)
* Complications of pregnancy: abruptio placentae, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, amniotic fluid embolism, retained intrauterine fetal demise, septic abortion, postpartum hemorrhage
* Massive tissue injury: trauma, burn, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, surgery
* Infection: bacterial (Gram-negative or Gram-positive), viral, fungal, or protozoan
* Transfusion reaction: ABO incompatibility
* Allergic or toxic reaction: snake venom
* Hemangioma: Kasabach–Merritt syndrome
* Aortic aneurysm

Liver disease, HELLP syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and malignant hypertension may mimic DIC but originate via other pathways. It is not the same as conditions where the blood vessels leak, such as capillary leak syndrome.

==Pathophysiology==

Under homeostatic conditions, the body is maintained in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable fibrin clot being the final product of hemostasis. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of thrombin), which is responsible for the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin degradation products (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis between clot formation and clot dissolution, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is necessary for the breakdown of fibrin clots, or fibrinolysis.

In DIC, the processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis are dysregulated, and the result is widespread clotting with resultant bleeding. Regardless of the triggering event of DIC, once initiated, the pathophysiology of DIC is similar in all conditions. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of a transmembrane glycoprotein called tissue factor (TF). TF is present on the surface of many cell types (including endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes) and is not normally in contact with the general circulation, but is exposed to the circulation after vascular damage. For example, TF is released in response to exposure to cytokines (particularly interleukin 1), tumor necrosis factor, and endotoxin. This plays a major role in the development of DIC in septic conditions. TF is also abundant in tissues of the lungs, brain, and placenta. This helps to explain why DIC readily develops in patients with extensive trauma. Upon exposure to blood and platelets, TF binds with activated factor VIIa (normally present in trace amounts in the blood), forming the extrinsic tenase complex. This complex further activates factor IX and X to IXa and Xa, respectively, leading to the common coagulation pathway and the subsequent formation of thrombin and fibrin.

The release of endotoxin is the mechanism by which Gram-negative sepsis provokes DIC. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, treatment causes the destruction of leukemic granulocyte precursors, resulting in the release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes from their storage granules, causing microvascular damage. Other malignancies may enhance the expression of various oncogenes that result in the release of TF and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which prevents fibrinolysis.

Excess circulating thrombin results from the excess activation of the coagulation cascade. The excess thrombin cleaves fibrinogen, which ultimately leaves behind multiple fibrin clots in the circulation. These excess clots trap platelets to become larger clots, which leads to microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis. This lodging of clots in the microcirculation, in the large vessels, and in the organs is what leads to the ischemia, impaired organ perfusion, and end-organ damage that occurs with DIC.

Coagulation inhibitors are also consumed in this process. Decreased inhibitor levels will permit more clotting so that a positive feedback loop develops in which increased clotting leads to more clotting. At the same time, thrombocytopenia occurs and this has been attributed to the entrapment and consumption of platelets. Clotting factors are consumed in the development of multiple clots, which contributes to the bleeding seen with DIC.

Simultaneously, excess circulating thrombin assists in the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, resulting in fibrinolysis. The breakdown of clots results in an excess of FDPs, which have powerful anticoagulant properties, contributing to hemorrhage. The excess plasmin also activates the complement and kinin systems. Activation of these systems leads to many of the clinical symptoms that patients experiencing DIC exhibits, such as shock, hypotension, and increased vascular permeability. The acute form of DIC is considered an extreme expression of the intravascular coagulation process with a complete breakdown of the normal homeostatic boundaries. DIC is associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.

There has been a recent challenge however to the basic assumptions and interpretations of the pathophysiology of DIC. A study of sepsis and DIC in animal models has shown that a highly expressed receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, termed the Ashwell-Morell receptor, is responsible for thrombocytopenia in bacteremia and sepsis due to &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; (SPN) and possibly other pathogens. The thrombocytopenia observed in SPN sepsis was not due to increased consumption of coagulation factors such as platelets, but instead was the result of this receptor&#x27;s activity, enabling hepatocytes to ingest and rapidly clear platelets from circulation. By removing prothrombotic components before they participate in the coagulopathy of DIC, the Ashwell-Morell receptor lessens the severity of DIC, reducing thrombosis and tissue necrosis, and promoting survival. The hemorrhage observed in DIC and among some tissues lacking this receptor may therefore be secondary to increased thrombosis with loss of the mechanical vascular barrier.

Activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways causes excess thrombus formation in the blood vessels. Consumption of coagulation factors due to extensive coagulation in turn causes bleeding.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of DIC is not made on a single laboratory value, but rather the constellation of laboratory markers and a consistent history of an illness known to cause DIC. Laboratory markers consistent with DIC include:
* Characteristic history (this is important because severe liver disease can essentially have the same laboratory findings as DIC)
* Prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) reflect the underlying consumption and impaired synthesis of the coagulation cascade.
* Fibrinogen level was initially thought to be useful in the diagnosis of DIC but because it is an acute phase reactant, it will be elevated due to the underlying inflammatory condition. Therefore, a normal (or even elevated) level can occur in over 57% of cases. A low level, however, is more consistent with the consumptive process of DIC.
* A rapidly declining platelet count
* High levels of fibrin degradation products, including D-dimer, are found owing to the intense fibrinolytic activity stimulated by the presence of fibrin in the circulation.
* The peripheral blood smear may show fragmented red blood cells (known as schistocytes) due to shear stress from thrombi. However, this finding is neither sensitive nor specific for DIC

A diagnostic algorithm has been proposed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. This algorithm appears to be 91% sensitive and 97% specific for the diagnosis of overt DIC. A score of 5 or higher is compatible with DIC and it is recommended that the score is repeated daily, while a score below 5 is suggestive but not affirmative for DIC and it is recommended that it is repeated only occasionally: It has been recommended that a scoring system be used in the diagnosis and management of DIC in terms of improving outcome.
* Presence of an underlying disorder known to be associated with DIC (no=0, yes=2)
* Global coagulation results
** Platelet count (&gt; 100k = 0, &lt; 100k = 1, &lt; 50k = 2)
** Fibrin degradation products such as D-Dimer (no increase = 0, moderate increase = 2, strong increase = 3)
** Prolonged prothrombin time (&lt; 3 sec = 0, &gt; 3 sec = 1, &gt; 6 sec = 2)
** Fibrinogen level (&gt; 1.0g/L = 0; &lt; 1.0g/L = 1)

==Treatment==
Treatment of DIC is centered on treating the underlying condition. Transfusions of platelets or fresh frozen plasma can be considered in cases of significant bleeding, or those with a planned invasive procedure. The target goal of such transfusion depends on the clinical situation. Cryoprecipitate can be considered in those with a low fibrinogen level. Treatment of thrombosis with anticoagulants such as heparin is rarely used due to the risk of bleeding.

Recombinant human activated protein C was previously recommended in those with severe sepsis and DIC, but drotrecogin alfa has been shown to confer no benefit and was withdrawn from the market in 2011.

Recombinant factor VII has been proposed as a &quot;last resort&quot; in those with severe hemorrhage due to obstetric or other causes, but conclusions about its use are still insufficient.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis varies depending on the underlying disorder, and the extent of the intravascular thrombosis (clotting). The prognosis for those with DIC, regardless of cause, is often grim: between 20% and 50% of patients will die. DIC with sepsis (infection) has a significantly higher rate of death than DIC associated with trauma.

==Epidemiology==
DIC is observed in approximately 1% of academic hospital admissions. DIC occurs at higher rates in people with bacterial sepsis (83%), severe trauma (31%), and cancer (6.8%).

<doc id="238127" wikidata="Q1471775" url="?curid=238127" title="Inverted pyramid (journalism)">
<text>The inverted pyramid is a metaphor used by journalists and other writers to illustrate how information should be prioritised and structured in prose (e.g., a news report). It is a common method for writing news stories and has wide adaptability to other kinds of texts, such as blogs, editorial columns and marketing factsheets. It is a way to communicate the basics about a topic in the initial sentences. The inverted pyramid is taught to mass communication and journalism students, and is systematically used in English-language media.

The inverted or upside-down pyramid can be thought of as a triangle pointing down. The widest part at the top represents the most substantial, interesting, and important information that the writer means to convey, illustrating that this kind of material should head the article, while the tapering lower portion illustrates that other material should follow in order of diminishing importance.

It is sometimes called a summary news lead style, or bottom line up front (BLUF). The opposite, the failure to mention the most important, interesting or attention-grabbing elements of a story in the opening paragraphs, is called &quot;burying the lead&quot;.

==Purpose==
Other styles are also used in news writing, including the &quot;anecdotal lead&quot;, which begins the story with an eye-catching tale or anecdote rather than the central facts; and the Q&amp;A, or question-and-answer format. The inverted pyramid may also include a &quot;hook&quot; as a kind of prologue, typically a provocative quote, question, or image, to entice the reader into committing to reading the full story.

This format is valued for two reasons. First, readers can leave the story at any point and understand it, even if they do not have all the details. Second, it conducts readers through the details of the story by the end.

This system also means that information less vital to the reader&#x27;s understanding comes later in the story, where it is easier to edit out for space or other reasons. This is called &quot;cutting from the bottom.&quot; Rather than petering out, a story may end with a &quot;kicker&quot;—a conclusion, perhaps call to action—which comes &quot;after&quot; the pyramid. This is particularly common in feature style articles.

==History==
Historians disagree about when the form was created. Many say the invention of the telegraph sparked its development by encouraging reporters to condense material, to reduce costs, or to hedge against the unreliability of the telegraph network. Studies of 19th-century news stories in American newspapers, however, suggest that the form spread several decades later than the telegraph, possibly because the reform era&#x27;s social and educational forces encouraged factual reporting rather than more interpretive narrative styles.

Chip Scanlan&#x27;s essay on the form includes this frequently cited example of telegraphic reporting:

Who, when, where, why, what, and how are addressed in the first paragraph. As the article continues, the less important details are presented. An even more pyramid-conscious reporter or editor would move two additional details to the first two sentences: That the shot was to the head, and that it was expected to prove fatal. The transitional sentence about the Grants suggests that less-important facts are being added to the rest of the story.

Other news outlets such as the Associated Press did not use this format when covering the assassination, instead adopting a chronological organization.

<doc id="238129" wikidata="Q646522" url="?curid=238129" title="Prostate massage">
<text>Prostate massage is the massage or stimulation of the male prostate gland for medical purposes or sexual stimulation.

The prostate takes part in the sexual response cycle and is essential for the production of semen. Due to its proximity to the anterior rectal wall, it can be stimulated from the anterior wall of the rectum or externally via the perineum.

==Medical uses==

===Digital rectal examination===
Prostate massage is part of the digital rectal examination (DRE) routinely given to men by urologists to look for nodules of prostate cancer and to obtain an expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) specimen for microscopy and microbiological culture to screen for prostatitis.

====Therapy for prostatitis====

In the late 1990s, a small number of doctors tried prostate massage in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis with uncertain results. In recent trials, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone. As a consequence of these findings, prostate massage is not officially sanctioned in medicine for the treatment of any medical disorder today. Prostatic massage should &quot;never&quot; be performed on patients with acute prostatitis, because the infection can spread elsewhere in the body if massage is performed.

====History====
Once the most popular therapeutic maneuver used to treat prostatitis, it was abandoned as primary therapy in the 1960s.

In the late 1990s, the ineffectiveness of drug treatments for chronic prostatitis led to a brief resurgence of interest in prostate massage. In a recent trial, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.

The practice is still used in some parts of China.

===Risks===
Vigorous prostate massage has been documented to have injurious consequences: periprostatic hemorrhage, cellulitis, septicaemia, possible disturbance and metastasis of prostate cancer to other parts of the body, and hemorrhoidal flare-up, and rectal fissures.

===Electroejaculation===

Electroejaculation is a procedure in which nerves are stimulated via an electric probe, which is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate. The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. It is most commonly encountered in animal husbandry for the purpose of collecting semen samples for testing or breeding. Some devices are used under general anesthesia on humans who have certain types of anejaculation. Electroejaculation may also be used for posthumous sperm retrieval in humans. Electroejaculation is a different procedure from manual prostate massage.

==As a sexual practice==

===General===
Prostate massage is also used as an erotic massage for sexual stimulation, often to reach orgasm. The prostate is sometimes referred to as the &quot;male G-spot&quot; or &quot;P-spot&quot;. Some males can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or receptive anal intercourse, and males who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females&#x27; accounts of G-spot stimulation. Prostate stimulation can sometimes produce a strong, powerful orgasm. However, all male orgasms, including those by penile stimulation, involve muscular contractions in the prostate gland. It is possible for some males to achieve orgasms through prostate stimulation alone. Stimulation may be achieved by use of one or more fingers or by using sex toys designed to bring pressure to the anterior wall of the rectum at the location of the gland.

Prostate massage may be practiced between sexual partners, either as a discrete activity or during other sexual acts stimulating the penis for example. The increasing availability (online via the Internet) of purpose-designed, safe, and hygienic sex toys and devices aimed at prostate stimulation may encourage sexual experimentation and incorporation into sex play. The use of a finger for anal penetration and prostate stimulation can enhance a male&#x27;s orgasm or vary the sensations experienced during sexual arousal. The finger of the prostate massager is introduced into the rectum through the anus and the prostate gland is gently massaged via the anterior (front) wall of the rectum. In some individuals or for some massagers the correct location of the prostate may be slightly too deep or the finger too short to reach easily. Prostate massage can be performed individually or with the help of a partner.

Prostate massage may also be used in long-term orgasm denial play, for the purpose of relieving the immediate need for orgasm without impacting general feelings of arousal. For this purpose, it is often referred to as milking.

There are safety matters relating to prostate stimulation and anal penetration. It is strongly recommended that plenty of lubricant be used with prostate massagers to prevent rectal lining damage. A smaller instrument or finger may be introduced gradually to minimize the discomfort that some may feel. Massagers may be used with or without a condom; however, because of the bacteria found in the rectum, if a condom is not used, it is crucial to clean the tool with soap before use in another orifice or by a partner. Receiving anal stimulation may cause feelings of having to defecate. More often than not, this is just a sensation that the stimulation causes and may take some getting used to.

===Equipment===
A &quot;prostate massager&quot;, or &quot;prostate stimulator&quot;, is a device for massaging the prostate gland. The shape of a prostate massager is similar to a finger since prostate massages are traditionally given digitally (for example, via fingering). They usually have a slightly curved head to effectively massage the prostate. Lubricant is usually necessary before inserting anything into the anus and helps to avoid injury to the rectal mucosa (lining). Caution should be exercised when a prostate massager is used because of the sensitivity of the prostate. Correct use involves a medium to light repetitive massage, or circular motion—the device being used to administer the massage should not be used too vigorously or without care, since this may lead to injury.

Prostate massage equipment ranges from dildos to butt plugs. When used in sexual practice, prostate massagers are commonly referred to as &quot;prostate toys&quot;, &quot;prostate sex toys&quot;, and &quot;anal toys&quot;. These prostate massagers are inserted into the rectum through the anus and are intended to stimulate the prostate by simple massaging or vibrating. They are used during foreplay by many couples.

Prostate dildos are similar to vaginal dildos, but they tend to be more curved, slimmer, and with a softer texture. Some of the new prostate dildos on the market are driven by batteries and offer vibration at the tip; the speed or intensity of which may be changed depending on the subject&#x27;s personal preference. Unlike vaginal dildos, the anal prostate massager has a flared end to prevent it from being fully inserted and &#x27;lost&#x27; inside the rectum.

Some males prefer butt plugs, which are easy to use, and can be inserted freely and left in place while the male&#x27;s hands are free for other sexual activities such as masturbation. Anal plugs also come in various shapes, sizes, and designs and are not commonly intended to stimulate the prostate. Newer, more angled models (second generation) of prostate massagers have been developed to provide a more direct and thorough prostate gland massage. These new devices feature a more curved shape and are slightly longer than the originals. They commonly have a narrow neck and a flared end to avoid losing them in the rectum. While many massagers rely upon the body&#x27;s natural muscular contractions of the anal sphincter and anal wall to stimulate the prostate, some of the newer models come with vibrators built into them to increase sexual pleasure.

<text>Protein was an American punk, alternative, post-grunge, metal band, formed in 1994 in San Francisco, California, United States. 

Forming their first band after they were kicked out of a San Francisco-area high school, vocalist/guitarist Josh Zee (the son of a professional folksinger) and drummer Dan Thompson, played for several years in various local bands before forming the grungy alternative pop band, Protein, in 1994. The duo played several shows before replacing their part-time bassist with Russ Violet, and made a good showing at a San Francisco music-industry showcase in 1996. Signed to Sony&#x27;s Work subsidiary, Protein released their debut album, &quot;Ever Since I Was a Kid&quot;, in 1997. A second album, &quot;Songs About Cowgirls&quot;, was released in 1999. They toured extensively throughout the U.S. on &quot;The Warped Tour&quot; and also toured Europe and Japan as part of MTV Asia Summer Fest.

==Members==
* Josh Zee - Guitars/Vocals
* Russ Violet - Bass
* Dan (Danny) Thompson - Drums/Vocals

== Solo work ==
After their release from Sony in 2000, the members of the band moved onto other projects:

Josh Zee moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he met and collaborated with Teal Collins to form &quot;The Mother Truckers&quot;, a band that fused Southern rock, country, and blues. They then moved the band to Austin, Texas in 2005 and spent a decade, procuring a residency and grew a sizeable fanbase and released four albums: &quot;Something Worth Dying For&quot;, &quot;Broke, Not Broken&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go To Bed&quot;, and &quot;Van Tour&quot;. The Mother Truckers toured across the United States and Europe, performing with acts such as Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Shooter Jennings, The Supersuckers, among others. 

Russ Violet joined the San Francisco-based group The Monolith to record and release the 2004 album &quot;Here Comes The Monolith&quot;. 

Dan Thompson joined Zee as drummer for The Mother Truckers from 2004 to 2007. During this time, he played with other musicians such as Les Claypool of Primus, Mark Rivera (Billie Joel), Vince Neil, Jakob Dylan, and Doug Grean. In 2008, he played drums for Scott Weiland on his solo album, &quot;&quot;Happy&quot; in Galoshes&quot;, touring the United States, and performing on TV shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. In 2010, he joined The Alan Parsons Live Project.

<text>A melee ( or ) is a confused hand-to-hand fight among several people. The English term &quot;melee&quot; originated circa 1648 from the French word &quot;&quot; (), derived from the Old French &quot;mesler&quot;, from which &quot;medley&quot; and &quot;meddle&quot; were also derived.

The 1812 tabletop wargame &quot;Kriegsspiel&quot;, and H.G.

The term was brought over to tabletop role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and in turn to role-playing video games, to describe any close-combat encounter.

<doc id="238143" wikidata="Q272615" url="?curid=238143" title="J. L. Austin">
<text>John Langshaw Austin (26 March 1911 – 8 February 1960) was an English philosopher of language and leading proponent of ordinary language philosophy, best known for developing the theory of speech acts.

Austin pointed out that we use language to &quot;do&quot; things as well as to &quot;assert&quot; things, and that the utterance of a statement like &quot;I promise to do so-and-so&quot; is best understood as &quot;doing&quot; something—&quot;making a promise—&quot;rather than making an assertion about anything. Hence the title of one of his best-known works, &quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot; (1955). 

Austin, in providing his theory of speech acts, makes a significant challenge to the philosophy of language, far beyond merely elucidating a class of morphological sentence forms that function to do what they name. 

Austin&#x27;s work ultimately suggests that all speech and all utterance is the doing of something with words and signs, challenging a metaphysics of language that would posit denotative, propositional assertion as the essence of language and meaning.

==Life==
Austin was born in Lancaster, Lancashire, England, the second son of Geoffrey Langshaw Austin (1884–1971), an architect, and Mary Hutton Bowes-Wilson (1883–1948; &quot;née&quot; Wilson). In 1921 the family moved to Scotland, where Austin&#x27;s father became the secretary of St Leonards School, St Andrews. Austin was educated at Shrewsbury School in 1924, earning a scholarship in Classics, and went on to study classics at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1929.

In 1930 Austin received a First in Classical Moderations (Greek and Latin) and in the following year won the Gaisford Prize for Greek prose. In finals in 1933 he received a first in Literae Humaniores (Philosophy and Ancient History). Literae Humaniores introduced Austin to serious philosophy and gave him a lifelong interest in Aristotle. Austin won a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, that year, but aside from being friends with Isaiah Berlin, he did not like its lack of structure, and undertook his first teaching position in 1935, as fellow and tutor at Magdalen College, Oxford.

Austin&#x27;s early interests included Aristotle, Kant, Leibniz, and Plato (particularly the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;). His contemporary influences included G. E. Moore, John Cook Wilson and H. A. Prichard. These contemporary influences shaped their views about general philosophical questions on the basis of careful attention to the more specific judgements we make. They took our specific judgements to be more secure than more general judgements. According to Guy Longworth writing in &quot;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s plausible that some aspects of Austin&#x27;s distinctive approach to philosophical questions derived from his engagement with&quot; Moore, Wilson, and Prichard.

During World War II Austin joined the military in July 1940, and married his student Jean Coutts in spring 1941. Austin served in the British Intelligence Corps and was responsible for as many as 500 analysts. Known as &quot;the Martians&quot;, the group&#x27;s preparation for D-Day helped keep Allied casualties much lower than expected. Austin left the army with the rank of lieutenant colonel and was honoured for his intelligence work with an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire), the French Croix de Guerre, and the U.S. Officer of the Legion of Merit.

After the war Austin became White&#x27;s Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford, as a Professorial Fellow of Corpus Christi College. Publishing little, his influence would largely make itself felt through his teaching in lectures and tutorials and, especially, his famous &#x27;Saturday morning meetings&#x27;.

Austin visited Harvard and Berkeley in the mid-fifties, in 1955 delivering the William James Lectures at Harvard that would become &quot;How to Do Things With Words&quot;, and offering a seminar on excuses whose material would find its way into &quot;A Plea for Excuses&quot;. It was at this time that he met and befriended Noam Chomsky. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1956 to 1957.

Before he could decide whether to accept an offer to move to Berkeley, Austin died on 8 February 1960 at the age of 48, shortly after being diagnosed with lung cancer. His wealth, after probate, was £15,049 0s. 5d. (equivalent to £ in ). At the time of his death, he was developing a semantic theory based on sound symbolism, using the English gl-words as data.

==Work==

=== &quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot; ===
&quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot; (1955/1962) is perhaps Austin&#x27;s most influential work. This work is based on a series of lectures that Austin delivered at Oxford University (1951-1954) and then at Harvard University (1955). A version of these lectures was published as a book. In contrast to the positivist view, he argues, sentences with truth-values form only a small part of the range of utterances.

After introducing several kinds of sentences which he asserts are neither true nor false, he turns in particular to one of these kinds of sentences, which he calls &quot;performative utterances&quot; or just &quot;performatives&quot;. These he characterises by two features:

* First, performative sentences—though they may take the form of a typical indicative sentence—are not used to describe (or &quot;constate&quot;), and are thus neither true nor false; i.e., they have no truth-value.
* Second, to utter one of these sentences in appropriate circumstances is not just to &quot;say&quot; something, but rather to &quot;thereby perform&quot; a certain kind of action (i.e., beyond and in addition to that of speaking alone).

When something goes wrong in connection with a performative utterance it is—in Austin&#x27;s words—&quot;infelicitous&quot; or &quot;unhappy&quot;, rather than &quot;false&quot;.

The action that is performed when a &quot;performative utterance&quot; is issued belongs to what Austin later calls a &quot;speech-act&quot;. More particularly, the kind of action Austin has in mind is what he subsequently terms the &quot;illocutionary act&quot;. For example, if you say &quot;I name this ship the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;&quot;, and the circumstances are appropriate in certain ways, then you will have done something special: namely, you will have thus christened the ship. Other examples include &quot;I take this man as my lawfully wedded husband&quot; (used in the course of a marriage ceremony), or &quot;I bequeath this watch to my brother&quot; (as occurring in a will). In all three cases the sentence is not being used to &quot;describe&quot; or &quot;state&quot; what one is doing, but being used to &quot;actually do&quot; it.

After numerous attempts to find more characteristics of performatives, and after having met with many difficulties, Austin makes what he calls a &quot;fresh start&quot;, in which he considers &quot;more generally the senses in which to say something may be to do something, or in saying something we do something&quot;.

For example: John Smith turns to Sue Snub and asks &quot;Is Jeff&#x27;s shirt red?&quot;, to which Sue replies &quot;Yes&quot;. John has undertaken a series of bodily movements which result in the production of a certain sound; Austin calls such a performance a &quot;phonetic act&quot;, and the resulting &quot;certain sound&quot; a &quot;phone&quot;. John&#x27;s utterance also conforms to the lexical and grammatical conventions of English—that is, John has produced an English sentence; Austin calls this a &quot;phatic act&quot;, and labels such utterances &quot;phemes&quot;. John also referred to Jeff&#x27;s shirt, and to the colour red. To use a pheme with a more or less definite sense and reference is to utter a &quot;rheme&quot;, and to perform a &quot;rhetic act&quot;. Note that rhemes are a sub-class of phemes, which in turn are a sub-class of phones. One cannot perform a rheme without also performing a pheme and a phone. The performance of these three acts is the performance of a &quot;locution&quot;—it is the act of saying something.

John has therefore performed a locutionary act. He has also done at least two other things: he has asked a question of, and elicited an answer from, Sue; in so doing, he has performed two further speech-acts, as Austin would have it:

# Asking a question is an example of the &quot;illocutionary act.&quot; To perform an illocutionary act is to use a locution with a certain force; that is, in contrast to a locution—the act &quot;of&quot; saying something—an illocutionary act is an act performed &quot;in&quot; saying something. Other examples would be making an assertion, giving an order, and promising to do something.
# Eliciting an answer is an example of what Austin calls a &quot;perlocutionary act:&quot; an act performed &quot;by&quot; the saying of something. Whereas illocutions and locutions are alternative descriptions of the utterance itself, perlocutions are classifiable by the further effects of an utterance. Other examples would be a heeded warning, or a successful attempt at persuasion.

Notice that if one successfully performs a perlocution, one also succeeds in performing both an illocution and a locution.

In the theory of speech acts, attention has especially focused on the illocutionary act; much less on the locutionary and perlocutionary act; and only rarely on the subdivision of the locution into phone, pheme and rheme.

===Performative utterance===
According to Austin, a &quot;performative utterance&quot; refers to the action of &quot;performing&quot; or &quot;doing&quot; a certain action; for example, when people say &quot;I promise to do so and so&quot;, they are generating the action of making a promise &quot;by&quot; so speaking. If this is accomplished without any flaw (in this case: if the promise is fulfilled), the performative utterance is &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;felicitous&quot;; if, on the other hand, one fails to do as promised, it is &quot;unhappy&quot;, or &quot;infelicitous&quot;. Notice that performative utterance is not truth-valuable; i.e., the judgements &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; do not apply. 
Austin variously opposes different categories of utterance in order to analyze the differences, or lack thereof, between them: &quot;explicit&quot; vs. &quot;implicit&quot; or &quot;inexplicit&quot; performatives; &quot;explicit&quot; performatives vs. &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;primary&quot; utterances or performatives; and &quot;pure&quot; performatives vs. &quot;half-descriptive&quot; vs. &quot;descriptive&quot; utterances. 

In &quot;How to Do Things With Words&quot; (edited by J. O. Urmson &amp; Marina Sbisà), which records Austin&#x27;s lectures on this topic, examples are offered for each of these distinctions:

* For &quot;explicit&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; performatives, Austin gives the example of &quot;I apologize&quot;—the saying of which &quot;explicitly performs&quot; the speech-act, such that it would be nonsensical for someone to ask: &quot;Does he or she &quot;really?&quot;&quot;
* As an example of a &quot;half-descriptive&quot; utterance, Austin gives the phrase &quot;I am sorry&quot;: there is some uncertainty as to whether the speaker is thereby &quot;offering&quot; an apology, or merely &quot;stating&quot; a fact; it could be either, absent clarifying context.
* A entirely &quot;descriptive&quot; utterance might be a statement such as &quot;I repent&quot;: here we have speech merely reporting upon our interlocutor&#x27;s feeling (rather than itself enacting repentance &quot;by&quot; so being spoken).
* &quot;Implicit&quot; performatives are those wherein the performance of an action is implied, but not expressly established; an example Austin uses is the phrase &quot;I shall be there&quot;: one may ask, in this case, if the speaker is &quot;promising&quot; to be there, stating an &quot;intention,&quot; or reporting a &quot;prediction.&quot;
* A &quot;primary&quot; performative admits of some ambiguity in interpretation: these may be taken to be either &quot;implicit&quot; performatives, or else entirely non-performative (sometimes &quot;constative,&quot; in Austin&#x27;s parlance) utterances. A similar situation obtains with a statement such as &quot;there is a bull in that field&quot;, which Austin gives as an illustration of a &quot;primitive&quot; utterance—does the speaker mean to warn us of the bull and thereby keep us out of the field, or is it merely an observation?

Most examples given in the book are of explicit performatives, because they are easy to identify and observe; identifying other performatives requires comparison and contrast with explicit performatives.

===&quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot;===

In the posthumously published &quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot; (the title is Austin&#x27;s own, and wittily echoes the title of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, Jane Austen&#x27;s first book, just as his name echoes hers), Austin criticizes the claims put forward by A. J. Ayer&#x27;s &quot;The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge&quot; (1940), and to a lesser extent, H. H. Price&#x27;s &quot;Perception&quot; (1932) and G. J. Warnock&#x27;s &quot;Berkeley&quot; (1953), concerning the sense-data theory. He states that perceptual variation, which can be attributed to physical causes, does not involve a figurative disconnection between sense and reference, due to an unreasonable separation of parts from the perceived object. Central to his argument, he shows that &quot;there is no one kind of thing that we &#x27;perceive&#x27; but many different kinds, the number being reducible if at all by scientific investigation and not by philosophy&quot; (Austin 1962a, 4).
Austin argues that Ayer fails to understand the proper function of such words as &quot;illusion&quot;, &quot;delusion&quot;, &quot;hallucination&quot;, &quot;looks&quot;, &quot;appears&quot; and &quot;seems&quot;, and uses them instead in a &quot;special way...invented by philosophers.&quot; According to Austin, normally these words allow us to express reservations about our commitment to the truth of what we are saying, and that the introduction of sense-data adds nothing to our understanding of or ability to talk about what we see.
As an example, Austin examines the word &#x27;real&#x27; and contrasts the ordinary meanings of that word based on everyday language and the ways it is used by sense-data theorists. In order to determine the meaning of &#x27;real&#x27; we have to consider, case by case, the ways and contexts in which it is used. By observing that it is (i) a substantive-hungry word that is sometimes (ii) an adjuster-word, as well as (iii) a dimension-word and (iv) a word whose negative use &quot;wears the trousers,&quot; Austin highlights its complexities. Only by doing so, according to Austin, can we avoid introducing false dichotomies.

===&quot;Philosophical Papers&quot;===
Austin&#x27;s papers were collected and published posthumously as &quot;Philosophical Papers&quot; by J. O. Urmson and Geoffrey Warnock. The book originally contained ten papers, two more being added in the second edition and one in the third. His paper &quot;Excuses&quot; has had a massive impact on criminal law theory.

Chapters 1 and 3 study how a word may have different, but related, senses. Chapters 2 and 4 discuss the nature of knowledge, focusing on performative utterance. Chapters 5 and 6 study the correspondence theory, where a statement is true when it corresponds to a fact. Chapters 6 and 10 concern the doctrine of speech acts. Chapters 8, 9, and 12 reflect on the problems that language encounters in discussing actions and considering the cases of excuses, accusations, and freedom.

===&quot;Are There &quot;A Priori&quot; Concepts?&quot;===
This early paper contains a broad criticism of idealism. The question set dealing with the existence of &quot;a priori&quot; concepts is treated only indirectly, by dismissing the concept of &quot;concept&quot; that underpins it.

The first part of this paper takes the form of a reply to an argument for the existence of universals: from observing that we do use words such as &quot;grey&quot; or &quot;circular&quot;, and that we use a single term in each case, it follows that there must be a &quot;something&quot; that is named by such terms—a universal. Furthermore, since each case of &quot;grey&quot; or &quot;circular&quot; is different, it follows that universals &quot;themselves&quot; cannot be sensed.

Austin carefully dismantles this argument, and in the process other transcendental arguments. He points out first that universals are not &quot;something we stumble across&quot;, and that they are &quot;defined&quot; by their relation to particulars. He continues by pointing out that, from the observation that we use &quot;grey&quot; and &quot;circular&quot; &quot;as if&quot; they were the names of things, it does not necessarily follow that these &quot;are actually&quot; things that exist, in any sense but the nominal. In the process he dismisses the notion that &quot;words are essentially proper names&quot;, asking: &quot;...why, if &#x27;one identical&#x27; word is used, &quot;must&quot; there be &#x27;one identical object&#x27; present which it denotes?&quot;

In the second part of the article, he generalizes this argument against universals to address concepts as a whole. He points out that it is &quot;facile&quot; to treat concepts as if they were &quot;an article of property&quot;. Such questions as &quot;do we possess such-and-such a concept?&quot; and &quot;how do we come to possess such-and-such a concept?&quot; are meaningless, because concepts are not the sort of thing that one possesses.

In the final part of the paper, Austin further extends the discussion to relations, presenting a series of arguments to reject the idea that there is some &quot;thing&quot; that is a relation. His argument likely follows from the conjecture of his colleague S. V. Tezlaf, who questioned what makes &quot;this&quot; &quot;that&quot;.

===&quot;The Meaning of a Word&quot;===
&quot;The Meaning of a Word&quot; is a polemic against doing philosophy by attempting to pin down the &quot;meaning&quot; of the words used, arguing that &#x27;there is &quot;no&quot; simple and handy appendage of a word called &quot;the meaning of the word (x)&quot;&#x27;.

Austin warns us to take care when removing words from their ordinary usage, giving numerous examples of how this can lead to error.

===&quot;Other Minds&quot;===

In &quot;Other Minds&quot;, one of his most highly acclaimed pieces, Austin criticizes the method that philosophers have used since Descartes to analyze and verify statements of the form &quot;That person S feels X.&quot; This method works from the following three assumptions:

*(1) We can know only if we intuit and directly feel what he feels.
*(2) It is impossible to do so.
*(3) It may be possible to find strong evidence for belief in our impressions.

Although Austin agrees with (2), quipping that &quot;we should be in a pretty predicament if I did&quot;, he found (1) to be false and (3) to be therefore unnecessary. The background assumption to (1), Austin claims, is that if I say that I know X and later find out that X is false, I did not know it. Austin believes that this is not consistent with the way we actually use language. He claims that if I was in a position where I would normally say that I know X, if X should turn out to be false, I would be speechless rather than self-corrective. He gives an argument that this is so by suggesting that believing is to knowing as intending is to promising— knowing and promising are the speech-act versions of believing and intending respectively.

===&quot;A Plea for Excuses&quot;===
&quot;A Plea for Excuses&quot; is both a demonstration by example, and a defense of the methods of ordinary language philosophy, which proceeds on the conviction that:
&quot;...our common stock of words embodies all the distinctions men have found worth drawing, and the connections they have found worth marking, in the lifetime of many generations: these surely are likely to be more numerous, more sound, since they have stood up to the long test of survival of the fittest, and more subtle, at least in all ordinary and reasonable practical matters, than any that you or I are likely to think up in our armchair of an afternoon—the most favourite alternative method.&quot;

An example of such a distinction Austin describes in a footnote is that between the phrases &quot;by mistake&quot; and &quot;by accident&quot;. Although their uses are similar, Austin argues that with the right examples we can see that a distinction exists in when one or the other phrase is appropriate.

Austin proposes some curious philosophical tools. For instance, he uses a sort of word game for developing an understanding of a key concept. This involves taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. This process is iterated until the list of words begins to repeat, closing a &quot;family circle&quot; of words relating to the key concept.

* &quot;It is, of course, not really correct that a sentence ever &quot;is&quot; a statement: rather, it is &quot;used&quot; in &quot;making a statement&quot;, and the statement itself is a &#x27;logical construction&#x27; out of the makings of statements.&quot; —&quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot;, Lecture 1, page 1 footnote 1. Oxford at the Clarendon press (1955).
* &quot;Going back into the history of a word, very often into Latin, we come back pretty commonly to pictures or models of how things happen or are done. These models may be fairly sophisticated and recent, as is perhaps the case with &#x27;motive&#x27; or &#x27;impulse&#x27;, but one of the commonest and most primitive types of model is one which is apt to baffle us through its very naturalness and simplicity.&quot; —&quot;A Plea for Excuses&quot; (1956). Published in &quot;Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1956-7.&quot; Transcribed into hypertext by Andrew Chrucky, 23 August 2004.

Oxford University Press, second edition (1970).
* &quot;We walk along the cliff, and I feel a sudden impulse to push you over, which I promptly do: I acted on impulse, yet I certainly intended to push you over, and may even have devised a little ruse to achieve it; yet even then I did not act deliberately, for I did not (stop to) ask myself whether to do it or not.&quot; —&quot;Philosophical Papers&quot;, &quot;The Meaning of a Word,&quot; p. 195. Oxford University Press, second edition (1970).
* &quot;You are more than entitled not to know what the word &#x27;performative&#x27; means. It is a new word and an ugly word, and perhaps it does not mean anything very much. But at any rate there is one thing in its favor, it is not a profound word.&quot; —&quot;Philosophical Papers&quot;, &quot;Performative Utterances&quot;, p. 233. Oxford University Press, second edition (1970).
* &quot;Let us distinguish between acting intentionally and acting deliberately or on purpose, as far as this can be done by attending to what language can teach us.&quot; —&quot;Philosophical Papers&quot;, &quot;Three Ways of Spilling Ink,&quot; p. 273. Oxford University Press, second edition (1970).
* &quot;Usually it is &quot;uses&quot; of words, not words in themselves, that are properly called &#x27;vague.&#x27;&quot; —&quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot;, p. 126. Oxford University Press (1962).
* &quot;But then we have to ask, of course, what this class comprises. We are given, as examples, &#x27;familiar objects&#x27;—chairs, tables, pictures, books, flowers, pens, cigarettes; the expression &#x27;material thing&#x27; is not here (or anywhere else in Ayer&#x27;s text) further defined. But does the ordinary man believe that what he perceives is (always) something like furniture, or like these other &#x27;familiar objects&#x27;—moderate-sized specimens of dry goods?&quot; —&quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot;, p. 8. Oxford University Press (1962).
* During a lecture at Columbia University attended by American philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser, Austin made the claim that although a double negative in English implies a positive meaning, there is no language in which a implies a negative. To which Morgenbesser responded in a dismissive tone, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; (Some have quoted it as &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;)

<doc id="238146" wikidata="Q491741" url="?curid=238146" title="Neutrophilia">
<text>Neutrophilia (also called neutrophil leukocytosis or occasionally neutrocytosis) is leukocytosis of neutrophils, that is, a high number of neutrophils in the blood. Because neutrophils are the main type of granulocytes, mentions of granulocytosis often overlap in meaning with neutrophilia.

The opposite of neutrophilia is neutropenia.

== Causes ==

Neutrophils are the primary white blood cells that respond to a bacterial infection, so the most common cause of neutrophilia is a bacterial infection, especially pyogenic infections.

Neutrophils are also increased in any acute inflammation, so will be raised after a heart attack, other infarct or burns.

Some drugs, such as prednisone, have the same effect as cortisol and adrenaline (epinephrine), causing marginated neutrophils to enter the blood stream. Overdoses of some drugs can cause very high levels of neutrophils in the blood. There is a single case report of severe neutrophilia with bupropion overdose.

A neutrophilia might also be the result of a malignancy. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML or chronic myeloid leukaemia) is a disease where the blood cells proliferate out of control. These cells may be neutrophils. Neutrophilia can also be caused by appendicitis and splenectomy.

Primary neutrophilia can additionally be a result of leukocyte adhesion deficiency.

== &quot;Left shift&quot; ==

A &quot;left shift&quot; refers to the presence of increased proportions of younger, less well differentiated neutrophils and neutrophil-precursor cells in the blood. This generally reflects early or premature release of myeloid cells from the bone marrow, the site where neutrophils are generated. A severe neutrophilia with left shift is referred to as a leukemoid reaction. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score, which refers to the amount of alkaline phosphatase per neutrophil, will increase. In a severe infection, toxic granulation changes happen to the neutrophils.

This can resemble Pelger-Huet anomaly.

<doc id="238150" wikidata="Q10715538" url="?curid=238150" title="Furnace (central heating)">
<text>A furnace (American English), referred to as a heater or boiler in British English, is an appliance used to generate heat for all or part of a building. Furnaces are mostly used as a major component of a central heating system. Furnaces are permanently installed to provide heat to an interior space through intermediary fluid movement, which may be air, steam, or hot water. Heating appliances that use steam or hot water as the fluid are normally referred to as a residential steam boilers or residential hot water boilers. The most common fuel source for modern furnaces in North America and much of Europe is natural gas; other common fuel sources include LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), fuel oil, wood and in rare cases coal. In some areas electrical resistance heating is used, especially where the cost of electricity is low or the primary purpose is for air conditioning. Modern high-efficiency furnaces can be up to 98% efficient and operate without a chimney, with a typical gas furnace being about 80% efficient. Waste gas and heat are mechanically ventilated through either metal flue pipes or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes that can be vented through the side or roof of the structure. Fuel efficiency in a gas furnace is measured in AFUE (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency).

==Etymology==
The name derives from Latin word &quot;fornax&quot;, which means oven.

==Categories==
Furnaces can be classified into four general categories, based on efficiency and design, natural draft, forced-air, forced draft, and condensing.

===Natural draft===
The first category of furnaces is natural draft, atmospheric burner furnaces. These furnaces consisted of cast-iron or riveted-steel heat exchangers built within an outer shell of brick, masonry, or steel. The heat exchangers were vented through brick or masonry chimneys. Air circulation depended on large, upwardly pitched pipes constructed of wood or metal. The pipes would channel the warm air into floor or wall vents inside the home. This method of heating worked because warm air rises.

The system was simple, had few controls, a single automatic gas valve, and no blower. These furnaces could be made to work with any fuel simply by adapting the burner area. They have been operated with wood, coke, coal, trash, paper, natural gas, fuel oil as well as whale oil for a brief period at the turn of the century. Furnaces that used solid fuels required daily maintenance to remove ash and &quot;clinkers&quot; that accumulated in the bottom of the burner area. In later years, these furnaces were adapted with electric blowers to aid air distribution and speed moving heat into the home. Gas and oil-fired systems were usually controlled by a thermostat inside the home, while most wood and coal-fired furnaces had no electrical connection and were controlled by the amount of fuel in the burner and position of the fresh-air damper on the burner access door.

===Forced-air===
The second category of furnace is the forced-air having atmospheric burner style with a cast-iron or sectional steel heat exchanger. Through the 1950s and 1960s, this style of furnace was used to replace the big, natural draft systems, and was sometimes installed on the existing gravity duct work. The heated air was moved by blowers which were belted driven and designed for a wide range of speeds. These furnaces were still big and bulky compared to modern furnaces, and had heavy-steel exteriors with bolt-on removable panels. Energy efficiency would range anywhere from just over 50% to upward of 65% AFUE. This style furnace still used large, masonry or brick chimneys for flues and was eventually designed to accommodate air-conditioning systems.

===Forced draft===
The third category of furnace is the forced draft, mid-efficiency furnace with a steel heat exchanger and multi-speed blower. These furnaces were physically much more compact than the previous styles. They were equipped with combustion air blowers that would pull air through the heat exchanger which greatly increased fuel efficiency while allowing the heat exchangers to become smaller. These furnaces may have multi-speed blowers and were designed to work with central air-conditioning systems.

===Condensing===

The fourth category of furnace is the high-efficiency condensing gas furnace. High efficiency condensing gas furnaces typically achieve between 90% and 98% AFUE. A condensing gas furnace includes a sealed combustion area, combustion draft inducer and a secondary heat exchanger. The primary gain in efficiency for a condensing gas furnace, as compared to a mid-efficiency forced-air or forced-draft furnace, is the capture of latent heat from the exhaust gases in the secondary heat exchanger. The secondary heat exchanger removes most of the heat energy from the exhaust gas, actually condensing water vapour and other chemicals (which form a mild acid) as it operates. The vent pipes, also known as the exhaust system, are often installed using PVC pipe instead of metal venting pipe to prevent corrosion, but this will vary based on geographical location of the installation and local regulations. The draft inducer allows for the exhaust piping to be routed vertically or horizontally as it exits the structure. A typical installation arrangement for high-efficiency furnaces includes a fresh air intake (supply) pipe that brings fresh air from outside the home to the furnace combustion unit. Normally the fresh combustion air is routed alongside the exhaust PVC during installation and the pipes exit through a sidewall of the home in the same location. High efficiency furnaces typically deliver a 25% to 35% fuel savings over a 60% AFUE furnace.

==Types of furnace output control==
===Single-stage===
A single-stage furnace has only one stage of operation, it is either on or off. This means that it is relatively noisy, always running at the highest speed, and always pumping out the hottest air at the highest velocity.

One of the benefits to a single-stage furnace is typically the cost for installation. Single-stage furnaces are relatively inexpensive since the technology is rather simple. However, the simplicity of single-stage gas furnaces come at the cost of blower motor noise and mechanical inefficiency. The blower motors on these single-stage furnaces consume more energy overall because, regardless of the heating requirements of the space, the fan and blower motors operate at a fixed-speed. Due to its One-Speed operation, a single-stage furnace is also called a single-speed furnace.

===Two-stage===
A two-stage furnace has to do two stage full speed and half (or reduced) speed. Depending on the demanded heat, they can run at a lower speed most of the time. They can be quieter, move the air at less velocity, and will better keep the desired temperature in the house.

===Modulating===
A modulating furnace can modulate the heat output and air velocity nearly continuously, depending on the demanded heat and outside temperature. This means that it only works as much as necessary and therefore saves energy.

==Heat distribution==
The furnace transfers heat to the living space of the building through an intermediary distribution system. If the distribution is through hot water (or other fluid) or through steam, then the furnace is more commonly called a boiler. One advantage of a boiler is that the furnace can provide hot water for bathing and washing dishes, rather than requiring a separate water heater. One disadvantage to this type of application is when the boiler breaks down, neither heating nor domestic hot water are available.

Air convection heating systems have been in use for over a century. Older systems rely on a passive air circulation system where the greater density of cooler air causes it to sink into the furnace area below, through air return registers in the floor, and the lesser density of warmed air causes it to rise in the ductwork; the two forces acting together to drive air circulation in a system termed &#x27;gravity-fed&#x27;. The layout of these &#x27;octopus’ furnaces and their duct systems is optimized with various diameters of large dampered ducts.

By comparison, most modern &quot;warm air&quot; furnaces typically use a fan to circulate air to the rooms of house and pull cooler air back to the furnace for reheating; this is called forced-air heat. Because the fan easily overcomes the resistance of the ductwork, the arrangement of ducts can be far more flexible than the octopus of old. In American practice, separate ducts collect cool air to be returned to the furnace. At the furnace, cool air passes into the furnace, usually through an air filter, through the blower, then through the heat exchanger of the furnace, whence it is blown throughout the building. One major advantage of this type of system is that it also enables easy installation of central air conditioning, simply by adding a cooling coil at the outlet of the furnace.

Air is circulated through ductwork, which may be made of sheet metal or plastic &quot;flex&quot; duct, and is insulated or uninsulated. Unless the ducts and plenum have been sealed using mastic or foil duct tape, the ductwork is likely to have a high leakage of conditioned air, possibly into unconditioned spaces. Another cause of wasted energy is the installation of ductwork in unheated areas, such as attics and crawl spaces; or ductwork of air conditioning systems in attics in warm climates.

<text>Holddown works by having each router start a timer when it first receive information about a network that is unreachable. Until the timer expires, the router will discard any subsequent route messages that indicate the route is actually reachable. It can resolve situations where multiple routers are connected indirectly. There are realistic scenarios where split horizon and split horizon with poisoned reverse are ineffective.

In other words, a holddown prevents a router from receiving route updates until the network appears to be stable—until either an interface stops changing state (flapping) or a better route is learned.

Holddowns are typically implemented with timers. If the router detects that a network is unreachable, the timer is started. The router will then wait a preset number of seconds until the network stabilizes. When the timer expires, the router will begin receiving its routing updates from other routers. For example, in RIP, the default holddown timer is set to 180 seconds.

<doc id="238156" wikidata="Q271933" url="?curid=238156" title="Patrick Ewing">
<text>Patrick Aloysius Ewing Sr. (born August 5, 1962) is a Jamaican-American basketball coach and former professional player who is a basketball ambassador for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) where he played most of his career as the starting center before ending his playing career with brief stints with the Seattle SuperSonics and Orlando Magic. Ewing is regarded as one of the greatest centers of all time, playing a dominant role in the New York Knicks&#x27; 1990s success.

Highly recruited out of Cambridge, Massachusetts, Ewing played center for the Georgetown Hoyas for four years—in three of which the team reached the NCAA championship game. ESPN in 2008 designated him the 16th-greatest college basketball player of all time. He had a seventeen-year NBA career, predominantly playing for the New York Knicks, where he was an eleven-time all-star and named to seven All-NBA teams. The Knicks appeared in the NBA Finals twice (1994 and 1999) during his tenure. He won Olympic gold medals as a member of the 1984 and 1992 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball teams. Ewing was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and as one of the 75 Greatest Players in NBA History in 2021. He is a two-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts (in 2008 for his individual career and in 2010 as a member of the 1992 Olympic team). Additionally he was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame as a member of the &quot;Dream Team&quot; in 2009. His number 33 was retired by the Knicks in 2003.

==Early life==
Ewing was born August 5, 1962, in Kingston, Jamaica to Carl and Dorothy Ewing. He was born one day before Jamaica declared independence. As a child, he excelled at cricket and soccer. In 1975, Ewing moved to the United States and settled with his family outside Boston in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Ewing learned to play basketball at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School with the help of John Fountain and his coach Mike Jarvis. With only a few years of playing experience, Ewing developed into one of the best high school players in the country, and among the most intimidating forces ever seen at the level given his size and athleticism. Due to his stature and the team&#x27;s dominance, Ewing was subject to taunts and jeers from hostile away crowds. Once rival fans even rocked the team bus when Ewing&#x27;s squad arrived to play an away game. Ewing led Cambridge Rindge and Latin to three consecutive Massachusetts Div. I state championships from 1979 to 1981. In order to prepare for college, Ewing joined the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound Program.

==College career==
As a senior in high school, Ewing signed a letter of intent to play for coach John Thompson at Georgetown University. Ewing made his announcement in Boston, in a room full of fans who were hoping for him to play for local schools Boston College or Boston University; when Ewing announced his decision to play at Georgetown, the fans left the room. During his recruitment, Ewing was very close to signing a letter of intent to play for Dean Smith and the University of North Carolina; however, while on his recruiting visit, he witnessed a nearby rally for the Ku Klux Klan, which dissuaded him from going there. Ewing made six recruiting visits in all; he also visited UCLA and Villanova.
As a freshman during the 1981–82 season, Ewing became one of the first college players to start and star on the varsity team as a freshman. That year, Ewing led the Hoyas to their second Big East tournament title in school history and a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. In the tournament, the Hoyas advanced to their first Final Four since 1943, where they defeated the University of Louisville, 50–46, to set up a showdown in the NCAA Final against North Carolina. In one of the most star-studded championship games in NCAA history, Ewing was called for goaltending five times in the first half (later revealed to be intentional at the behest of coach John Thompson), setting the tone for the Hoyas and making his presence felt. The Hoyas led late in the game, but a shot by future NBA superstar Michael Jordan gave North Carolina the lead. Georgetown still had a chance at winning the game in the final seconds, but Freddy Brown mistakenly threw a bad pass directly to opposing player James Worthy, sealing the win for the Tar Heels.

For the 1982–83 season, Ewing and the Hoyas began the season as the second-seeded ranked team in the country. An early-season showdown with #1 ranked Virginia and their star center Ralph Sampson was dubbed the &quot;Game of the Decade&quot;. Virginia&#x27;s veteran team won, 68–63, but Ewing at one point slam-dunked right over Sampson, a play which established Ewing as a dominating &quot;big man&quot;. The Hoyas posted a 22–10 record for the season and made another NCAA Tournament appearance, but Georgetown was defeated in the second round of the tournament by Memphis State. This would be the only season in Ewing&#x27;s Georgetown career where they did not make it at least as far as the National Championship game.

In the 1983–84 season, Ewing led Georgetown to the Big East regular-season championship, the Big East tournament championship and another #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Also, he was named the Big East Player of the Year. The Hoyas ultimately advanced to the Final Four for the third time in school history (and second time with Ewing) to face Kentucky, a team which had never lost a national semifinal game and was led by the &quot;Twin Towers&quot;, Sam Bowie and Melvin Turpin. Georgetown was able to turn an early 12 point deficit into a 53–40 win to advance to the National Championship game. In the final, the Hoyas faced the University of Houston, led by future Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon. Ewing and Georgetown prevailed with an 84–75 victory, giving the school its first and only NCAA Championship in school history. Ewing was named the tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player.

For the 1984–85 season, Ewing&#x27;s senior year, Georgetown was ranked #1 in the nation for the majority of the campaign. Ewing was again named the Big East Player of the Year and the team won the Big East tournament title yet again. They entered the NCAA tournament as the #1 overall seed of the East Region, where they wound up advancing to another Final Four, their third in four years. In the National Semifinal game, Georgetown faced their Big East rivals, St. John&#x27;s and Chris Mullin, the fourth meeting between the schools that year. The Hoyas easily defeated the Redmen 77–59, setting up a matchup with another Big East rival in unranked Villanova for the title. An overwhelming favorite going into the game, Georgetown was upset by the Wildcats 66–64, who shot a record 78.6 percent (22 of 28) from the floor, denying Ewing and Georgetown back-to-back titles. At the conclusion of the season, Ewing was awarded the Naismith Player of the Year Award and the Associated Press Player of the Year.

Ewing&#x27;s four-year college career is cited as one of the most successful college runs of all time. Among his many accomplishments, he helped Georgetown reach the final game of the NCAA Tournament three out of four years, win three Big East tournament titles, four Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards and was named a first-team All-American three times. He also left a cultural impact on the sport in a variety of ways. He was one of the first freshmen to not only start for but lead a major college basketball team, something unheard of back in his era. Also, he developed a habit of wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt underneath his jersey, which started a fashion trend among young athletes that lasts to this day.

==NBA career==

===New York Knicks (1985–2000)===

Ewing was expected to be the top pick in the 1985 NBA draft. The team that selected him would be making history by doing so. From 1966 until 1984, the NBA draft was conducted similarly to the NFL draft, where teams are awarded draft positions based on winning percentage. The difference was that instead of the team with the lowest percentage automatically being awarded the top pick, the NBA held a coin toss between the teams with the worst records in each conference and the winner of the coin toss selected first with the loser automatically picking second. This practice tended to encourage teams to purposely lose games in order to improve their draft position and potentially get into the coin toss. The only way two teams from the same conference could have the first two picks would have been if one of the two aforementioned teams traded their pick to another team (as the Indiana Pacers had done with what eventually became the number-two pick in the previous year&#x27;s draft).

Beginning with the 1985 draft, the NBA handled matters differently. Every team that qualified for the playoffs received positions based on their winning percentage, and the teams that did not were placed in a lottery. In the first lottery, the NBA did not determine the positions as they do now. In this case, the seven teams that did not qualify for the playoffs were each given an equal chance to get the top pick. Each team had its name and logo put in an envelope, and the envelopes were placed into a hopper and spun to shuffle them. Once done, Commissioner David Stern then drew an envelope from inside to determine who would pick first. In a move that would create controversy for years to come, the envelope Stern drew was the one belonging to the New York Knicks, inviting allegations the draw was rigged; Stern had also grown up a Knicks fan. The Knicks drafted Ewing, as expected, beginning a 15-year relationship. They then signed him to a 10-year, $32 million contract, a contract that &quot;The New York Times&quot; years later described as &quot;a tremendous contract at that time or any time.&quot;

Although injuries marred his first year in the league, he was voted NBA Rookie of the Year and named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team after averaging 20 points, 9 rebounds, and 2 blocks per game. Soon after he was considered one of the premier centers in the league. Ewing enjoyed a successful career; eleven times named an NBA All-Star, once named to the All-NBA First Team, six times a member of the All-NBA Second Team, and named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times. He was a member of the original Dream Team at the 1992 Olympic Games. He was also given the honor of being named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.

In the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Knicks played the defending NBA champion Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan. Ewing was unstoppable in Game 1, finishing with 34 points, 16 rebounds, and 6 blocks, and the Knicks beat Chicago 94–89. The Knicks were facing elimination in Game 6 when Ewing had one of the greatest games of his career. The team trailed 3–2 in the series, and Ewing was limited physically by a bad ankle sprain, but he helped the Knicks beat the Bulls 100–86 by scoring 27 points. NBC announcer Marv Albert called it a &quot;Willis Reed-type performance&quot;, but the Knicks were ultimately eliminated in Game 7 in a blowout, 110–81.

In an April 14, 1993, game, between the Knicks and the Charlotte Hornets, the Ewing suffered a moment of embarrassment when Muggsy Bogues, a point guard for the Hornets, managed to knock the ball loose as Ewing was shooting. The team looked like it was going to advance to the NBA Finals when they took a 2–0 lead over Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Both teams battled well, each winning on its home court in the first 4 games. However, the Bulls stunned the Ewing-led Knicks, winning Game 5 in New York 97–94 after Ewing&#x27;s teammate, Charles Smith, was repeatedly blocked down low by Bulls defenders on the game&#x27;s final possession. The Bulls would go on to win Game 6 96–88 and then claim their third straight NBA title. This would be one more season in which Ewing had to deal with no championships, despite the fact that the Knicks had the best regular-season record in the Eastern Conference at 60–22 and had the second-best record in the NBA, behind the Phoenix Suns, who were 62–20.

With Jordan out of the league, 1993–94 was considered a wide-open year in the NBA, and Ewing had declared that 1994 would be the Knicks&#x27; year. He was a main contributor to the Knicks&#x27; run to the 1994 NBA Finals, in which the Knicks—in the Finals for the first time since 1973—lost in the final seconds of Games 6 and 7 to Hakeem Olajuwon&#x27;s Houston Rockets. The Knicks, with Ewing leading them, had to survive a grueling trek through the playoffs simply to reach the Finals. They defeated the Bulls and Scottie Pippen in seven games in the 1994 Eastern Conference Semifinals (all seven games were won by the home team), and defeated Reggie Miller&#x27;s Indiana Pacers in the Conference Finals, which also took seven games to decide. In the Finals, the Knicks stole Game 2 in Houston, but could not hold court at home, dropping Game 3 at the Garden. The Knicks then won the next two games to return to Houston ahead 3–2. However, the Rockets won the next two games. Ewing made the most of his playoff run by setting a record for most blocked shots in a Finals series with 30 (later broken by Tim Duncan in 2003 with 32). He also set an NBA Finals record for most blocked shots in a single game, with 8 (surpassed by Dwight Howard in 2009).

The following year, a potential game-tying finger roll by Ewing rimmed out in the dwindling seconds of Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, resulting in a loss to the Indiana Pacers. In the 1995–96 season, Ewing and the Knicks were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in five games by the record-setting 1995–96 Bulls, who won 72 games that year en route to their fourth championship.

In the 1997 playoffs, the Knicks faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Ewing was involved in a Game 5 brawl where both teams&#x27; benches got involved. The Knicks, who were up 3–1 in the series going into Game 5, lost the next three games and were eliminated.

In the next season, Ewing&#x27;s career almost came to an end due to an injury. On December 20, 1997, in a game against the Milwaukee Bucks at the Bradley Center, Ewing was fouled by Andrew Lang while attempting a dunk. Ewing fell awkwardly and landed with all of his weight on his shooting hand. The result was a severely damaged wrist, with Ewing suffering a displaced fracture, a complete dislocation of the lunate bone, and torn ligaments. These injuries required emergency surgery to prevent nerve damage, and it was said that Ewing suffered injuries that were usually reserved for victims of vehicular accidents.

Ewing, who had only missed 20 games in the previous ten seasons, missed the remaining 56 games of the season, but he was able to rehabilitate the injury faster than expected, and as the playoffs began Ewing was talking about returning. The Heat and Knicks met in the playoffs for the second straight year. This time, the two teams met up in the first round of the playoffs. The series went to a decisive fifth game, but the Knicks avenged their loss to Miami the year before by beating the Heat in Miami 98–81. Ewing returned for Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Pacers. His presence was not enough, however, as the Knicks fell to the Pacers in five games.

The following season, Ewing and the Knicks qualified as the East&#x27;s eighth seed in a lockout-shortened season. Although battling an achilles tendon injury, Ewing led the Knicks to another victory over the Heat in the first round, 3–2. In the series-clinching Game 5, he scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. They followed that up by sweeping the Atlanta Hawks, and defeated the Pacers in the Conference Finals in 6 games, despite Ewing&#x27;s injury finally forcing him out of action. The Knicks could not, however, complete their Cinderella run, as they lost in the Finals to the San Antonio Spurs, 4–1.

In Ewing&#x27;s final season with the Knicks in 1999–2000, the team finished as the third seed in the East behind the Pacers and Heat. The team advanced to the Conference Finals again, sweeping the Toronto Raptors and beating the Heat for the third straight year in seven games, but could not defeat the Pacers and fell in six games. In his last year with the Knicks, Ewing had a game-winning slam dunk over Alonzo Mourning in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals to lead the Knicks to the Eastern Conference Finals. During his final season with the Knicks, Ewing played in his 1,000th NBA game, finishing his Knick career with a franchise-record 1,039 games played in a Knick uniform (he is the only player to play 1,000 games with the Knicks).

===Post-Knicks career===
During the 2000 off-season, Ewing requested a trade from New York, and the Knicks complied, sending Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics in a four-team trade; the Knicks also sent Chris Dudley to Phoenix in the deal, and received Glen Rice, Luc Longley, Travis Knight, Vladimir Stepania, Lazaro Borrell, Vernon Maxwell, two first-round draft picks (from the Los Angeles Lakers and Seattle) and two second-round draft picks from Seattle. After one season with the SuperSonics and another with the Orlando Magic, he announced his retirement on September 18, 2002. After that season, he took a job as an assistant coach with the Washington Wizards.

In 1,183 games over 17 seasons, Ewing averaged 21.0 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks per game, and averaged better than a 50% shooting percentage. As of 2021, Ewing was ranked 23rd on the NBA scoring list with 24,815 points.

Ewing played 1,039 games for the Knicks. On February 28, 2003, his jersey number 33 was retired by the team in a large ceremony at Madison Square Garden.

For the first time ever, Ewing represented the Knicks during the NBA draft lottery on May 14, 2019. They got the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft.

In October 2024, it was announced that Ewing would rejoin the Knicks as a basketball ambassador.

==National team career==
Ewing won Olympic gold medals as a member of the 1984 and 1992 United States men&#x27;s basketball teams. In 1984, Ewing averaged 11.0 points in eight games, and was the tournament&#x27;s leading shot blocker with 18. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame referred to the 1992 &quot;Dream Team&quot; as &quot;the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet&quot;.

Ewing was a defensive stalwart throughout his basketball career, although he often had difficulty placing on the NBA All-Defensive Team due to the defensive prowess of his contemporaries Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson.

In 1993, he led the NBA with 789 defensive rebounds. He was top ten in field goal percentage eight times, top ten in rebounds per game and total rebounds eight times, top ten in points and points per game eight times, and top ten in blocks per game for 13 years.

In 1999, Ewing became the 10th player in NBA history to record 22,000 points and 10,000 rebounds.

==Coaching career==
From 2002 to 2003, Ewing served as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards under the ownership of his longtime rival Michael Jordan. From 2003 through 2006, Ewing was an assistant with the Houston Rockets, before resigning to spend more time with his family. On July 3, 2007, Ewing was one of four assistants hired to serve under first-year Orlando Magic head coach Stan Van Gundy for the 2007–08 season.

The Magic reached the 2009 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. He correctly predicted a win in Game 7 of the second round against the defending champion Boston Celtics. Later in the playoffs, Ewing saw Magic captain Dwight Howard set a new NBA Finals record for most blocked shots in a single Finals game, with nine in Game 4, surpassing the previous record of eight by Ewing himself in Game 5 of the 1994 Finals.

In 2010, Ewing finally got the opportunity to coach his son Patrick Ewing Jr. in the 2010 summer league. Ewing Jr. played for the Magic.
In 2013, Ewing became an assistant coach with the Charlotte Bobcats (now Charlotte Hornets). On November 8, 2013, Ewing became the Bobcats&#x27; interim head coach due to regular head coach Steve Clifford having heart surgery. He lost his first game 101–91 against his former team, the Knicks.

On April 3, 2017, Ewing was hired as head coach of his former college team, the Georgetown Hoyas. In his first season as head coach, the Hoyas were 15–15 (5–13 in the Big East). The season ended without any postseason tournament play. In Ewing&#x27;s second season, Georgetown was 19–14, and finished tied in third place in the Big East with a 9–9 record. The Hoyas were awarded a bid in the 2019 National Invitation Tournament, their first postseason tournament since 2015. James Akinjo was named the Big East Rookie of the Year, and fellow freshmen Mac McClung and Josh Leblanc joined him on the Big East All-Freshman Team. In Ewing&#x27;s third season, the Hoyas finished 15–17 overall and 5–13 in the Big East and lost in the first round of the 2020 Big East tournament the day before all further postseason play was cancelled due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Ewing&#x27;s fourth season, after finishing the regular season with a record of 13–13 overall and 7–9 in the Big East, he led the Hoyas to the 2021 Big East Conference tournament championship as the eighth seed in the tournament. They defeated the first-seeded Villanova Wildcats in the quarterfinals. In the championship game, Georgetown defeated the second-seeded Creighton Bluejays 73–48, and qualified for the 2021 NCAA Division I basketball tournament. This marked Georgetown&#x27;s first NCAA tournament appearance since the 2014–15 season, breaking their longest NCAA drought in the modern era. The Hoyas were unable to build on this success in Ewing&#x27;s fifth season however, posting an overall record of 6–25 and going winless in Big East Conference play at 0–19 in the regular season followed by a first-round loss in the 2022 Big East tournament. In Ewing&#x27;s sixth season, Georgetown finished with an overall record of 7–25 and 2–18 in the Big East, including a first-round exit from the 2023 Big East tournament. On March 9, 2023, Ewing was fired as coach.

==Head coaching record==



==Other work==
Ewing interned in the office of Senator Bob Dole during multiple summers in college.

Ewing was in the 1996 movie &quot;Space Jam&quot; as himself, one of five NBA players whose talent was stolen (along with Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues). Ewing had a brief appearance, again as himself, in the movie &quot;Senseless&quot; starring Marlon Wayans.

Ewing made cameos as himself in the sitcoms &quot;Spin City&quot;, &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, and &quot;Webster&quot;. Most recently, he appeared in a 2009 ad for Snickers, suggesting that those who eat the candy bar might &quot;get dunked on by Patrick Chewing&quot;. He also made a silent cameo as the Angel of Death in &quot;The Exorcist III&quot;.

He co-wrote &quot;In the Paint&quot;, a painting how-to book for children.

In 2014, Ewing and sports agent David Falk announced a $3.3 million donation to the John R. Thompson, Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center under construction at Georgetown University. The amount is a reference to Ewing&#x27;s number, 33.

==Endorsements==
Ewing&#x27;s first sneaker endorsement was with Adidas in 1986. In 1991, Next Sports signed a licensing deal to release footwear under Ewing&#x27;s name in the United States under a new company, Ewing Athletics, which would operate until 1996. In 2012, David Goldberg and his company GPF Footwear LLC successfully teamed up with Ewing to resurrect the old Ewing Athletics line, and bring it back into stores, capitalizing on the current retro trend in the footwear market.

==Personal life==

Ewing was married to Rita Williams from 1990 to 1998. He has three children, including Patrick Ewing Jr.

In July 2001, Ewing testified in the federal trial of an Atlanta club owner charged with facilitating prostitution. Ewing told the court he received oral sex from dancers at the club in 1996 and 1997, but did not pay any money for the encounters and did not feel that he was involved in an act of prostitution. Ewing was never charged with a crime in connection with The Gold Club encounters.

After friend and rival NBA center Alonzo Mourning was diagnosed with a kidney ailment in 2000, Ewing promised that he would donate one of his kidneys to Mourning if he ever needed one. In 2003, Ewing was tested for kidney compatibility with Mourning, but Mourning&#x27;s cousin was found to be the better match.

Patrick Ewing Jr. transferred to his father&#x27;s alma mater, Georgetown University, after two years at Indiana University. Patrick Jr. wore the same jersey number that his father wore, #33. He was drafted by the Sacramento Kings in the second round with the 43rd pick of the 2008 NBA draft, but was then traded to the New York Knicks, his father&#x27;s old team.

<doc id="238157" wikidata="Q1193815" url="?curid=238157" title="Stan Sakai">
<text>is a Japanese-born American cartoonist and comic book creator. He is best known as the creator of the comic series &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;.

== Early life ==
Sakai was born Masahiko Sakai (坂井雅彦) in Kyoto, Japan, to Akio and Teruko Sakai. His father was a second-generation Japanese American from Hawaii, who was stationed in Japan with the U.S. occupation forces. Sakai and his family moved back to Hawaii when he was two years old, and Sakai was raised in the Kaimuki neighborhood of Honolulu.
He studied Fine Arts (disciplines) at the University of Hawaii before continuing his training at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.

==Career==
He began his career by lettering comic books (notably &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot; by Sergio Aragonés and Mark Evanier) and wrote and illustrated &quot;The Adventures of Nilson Groundthumper and Hermy&quot;; a comic series with a medieval setting, influenced by Sergio Aragonés&#x27; &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;. The characters first appeared in &quot;Albedo Anthropomorphics #2&quot; in 1984, and they were subsequently featured in issues of &quot;Critters&quot;, &quot;Grimjack&quot;, &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; and &quot;Furrlough&quot;.

Sakai became famous with the creation of &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;, the epic saga of Miyamoto Usagi, a samurai rabbit living in late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth-century Japan. First published in 1984, the comic continues to this day, with Sakai as the lone author and nearly sole artist (Tom Luth serves as the main colorist on the series, and Sergio Aragonés has made two small contributions to the series: the story &quot;Broken Ritual&quot; is based on an idea by Aragonés, and he served as a guest inker for the black-and-white version of the story &quot;Return to Adachi Plain&quot; that is featured in the Volume 11 trade paperback edition of &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;). He also created a futuristic spinoff series &quot;Space Usagi&quot;. His favorite movie is &quot;Satomi Hakkenden&quot; (1959). The Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles&#x27;s Little Tokyo presented an exhibit entitled &quot;Year of the Rabbit: Stan Sakai&#x27;s &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;&quot; from July 9 through October 30, 2011.

Sakai wrote and illustrated the story &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Springfield Anymore!&quot; for &quot;Bart Simpson&#x27;s Treehouse of Horror #7&quot; and illustrated the back cover of &quot;Treehouse of Horror #6&quot;.
Sakai was the artist for &quot;Riblet&quot;, the back-up feature in the trade paperback of &quot;Stupid, Stupid Rat Tails&quot;.

In 2013, Sakai illustrated the limited comic book series &quot;47 Ronin&quot;, an adaptation of the famed story of the 47 Ronin written by Dark Horse Comics Publisher Mike Richardson and with &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; writer Kazuo Koike as an editorial consultant.

The seventh episode of the 2012 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated series&#x27; fifth season, &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, was written by Sakai and features Miyamoto Usagi, who has appeared in a few TMNT shows to date.

In 2020, it was announced that Sakai would serve as an executive producer on the upcoming Netflix original animated series &quot;Samurai Rabbit: The Usagi Chronicles&quot;, which is based on &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;.

In April 2022, Sakai was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sakai&#x27;s contribution is an original &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; story in which the main character come to the aid of refugees fleeing the invasion of their land by a warlord, themes that speak to the events in Ukraine.

<doc id="238174" wikidata="Q840036" url="?curid=238174" title="Japanese sea lion">
<text>The Japanese sea lion (Zalophus japonicus) (, ) was an aquatic mammal that became extinct in the 1970s. It was considered to be a subspecies of the related California sea lion (&quot;Z. californianus&quot;) until 2003. They inhabited the western North Pacific and its marginal seas including the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, especially around the coastal areas of the Japanese Archipelago and the Korean Peninsula. They generally bred on sandy beaches which were open and flat, but sometimes in rocky areas. They were hunted commercially in the 1900s, leading to their extinction.

==Taxonomy==

Prior to 2003, it was considered to be a subspecies of California sea lion as &quot;Zalophus californianus japonicus&quot;. However, it was subsequently reclassified as a separate species. DNA analysis in 2007 estimated that the divergence point between the two sea lions took place around 2 million years ago (mya) in the early Pleistocene.

Several taxidermied specimens can be found in Japan and in the National Museum of Natural History, Leiden, the Netherlands, bought by Philipp Franz von Siebold. The British Museum possesses a pelt and four skull specimens.

==Description==

Male Japanese sea lions were dark grey, reaching lengths of and weighed about . Females were significantly smaller at long and weighed about with a lighter grey colour than the males.

==Distribution and habitat==
Japanese sea lions were found along the northwest Pacific coastline, specifically in Japan, Korea, southern Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Sakhalin Island. However, they may not have existed in Kamchatka, with their northernmost range extending only to the Kuril Islands. Sightings of individual Japanese sea lions still persist in Korea, but these are probably misidentified Steller&#x27;s sea lions (&quot;Eumetopias jubatus&quot;). The only reliable report from Kamchatka may have been of a single individual shot at Moneron Island in 1949.

Old Korean accounts also describe that the sea lion and spotted seal (&quot;Phoca largha&quot;) were found in a broad area containing the BoHai Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the Sea of Japan. Many places along the Japanese coastline are named after sea lions or seals, such as Ashika-iwa (海驢岩 or 海鹿岩, sea lion rock) , Ashika-jima (海獺島 or 海鹿島, sea lion island), and Cape Inubō (犬吠埼, dog-barking point). Bones of &quot;Z. japonicus&quot; dating to 3500–2000 BC were found in the Shell Mound in Dongsam-dong, Busan. Genetic evidence confirms the former presence of &quot;Z. japonicus&quot; on the Liancourt rocks.
They usually resided on flat, open, and sandy beaches, but rarely in rocky areas. Their preference was to rest in caves.

==Exploitation and extinction==
Many bones of the Japanese sea lion have been excavated from shell middens from the Jōmon period in Japan. An 18th-century encyclopedia, &quot;Wakan Sansai Zue&quot;, describes that the meat was not tasty and they were only used to render oil for oil lamps. Valuable oil was extracted from the skin, its internal organs were used to make expensive medicine, and its whiskers and skin were used as pipe cleaners and leather goods, respectively. At the turn of the 20th century, they were captured for use in circuses.

Harvest records from Japanese commercial fishermen in the early 1900s show that as many as 3,200 sea lions were harvested at the turn of the century, and overhunting caused harvest numbers to fall drastically to 300 sea lions by 1915 and to a few dozen sea lions by the 1930s. Japanese commercial harvest of Japanese sea lions ended in the 1940s when the species became virtually extinct. In total, Japanese trawlers harvested as many as 16,500 sea lions, enough to cause their extinction. Submarine warfare during World War II is also believed to have contributed to their habitat destruction. The last population survey dates from the 1950&#x27;s and reported a population of only 50 to 60 animals on the Liancourt Rocks. The most recent sightings of &quot;Z. japonicus&quot; are from the 1970s, with the last confirmed record being a juvenile specimen captured in 1974 off the coast of Rebun Island, northern Hokkaido. There were a few unconfirmed sightings in 1983 and 1985. In any case, it was one of the most recent marine mammal extinctions to occur, alongside the Caribbean monk seal which went extinct at around the same time.

==Attempted rewilding==

In 2007, the South Korean Ministry of Environment announced that South Korea, North Korea, Russia, and China will collaborate on bringing back sea lions to the Sea of Japan, starting with a search for any Japanese sea lions that might still be alive. The National Institute of Environmental Research of South Korea was commissioned to conduct feasibility research for this project. If the animal cannot be found, the South Korean government plans to relocate California sea lions from the United States. The South Korean Ministry of Environment supports the effort because of the symbolism, national concern, the restoration of the ecological system, and possible ecotourism.

==Post-extinction claimed sightings or vagrant records==
Sightings of single sea lions of unclear identities have been reported at Iwami, Tottori in July 2003, and on Koshikijima Islands in March 2016. Both animals were positively identified as Otariidae based on photographs, but their identities are unclear.

<text>Horace Ward Martin Tavares Silver (September 2, 1928 – June 18, 2014) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger, particularly in the hard bop style that he helped pioneer in the 1950s.

After playing tenor saxophone and piano at school in Connecticut, Silver got his break on piano when his trio was recruited by Stan Getz in 1950. Silver soon moved to New York City, where he developed a reputation as a composer and for his bluesy playing. Frequent sideman recordings in the mid-1950s helped further, but it was his work with the Jazz Messengers, co-led by Art Blakey, that brought both his writing and playing most attention. Their &quot;Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers&quot; album contained Silver&#x27;s first hit, &quot;The Preacher&quot;. After leaving Blakey in 1956, Silver formed his own quintet, with what became the standard small group line-up of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums. Their public performances and frequent recordings for Blue Note Records increased Silver&#x27;s popularity, even through changes of personnel. His most successful album was &quot;Song for My Father&quot;, made with two iterations of the quintet in 1963 and 1964.

Several changes occurred in the early 1970s: Silver disbanded his group to spend more time with his wife and to concentrate on composing; he included lyrics in his recordings; and his interest in spiritualism developed. The last two of these were often combined, resulting in commercially unsuccessful releases such as &quot;The United States of Mind&quot; series. Silver left Blue Note after 28 years, founded his own record label, and scaled back his touring in the 1980s, relying in part on royalties from his compositions for income. In 1993, he returned to major record labels, releasing five albums before gradually withdrawing from public view because of health problems.

As a player, Silver transitioned from bebop to hard bop by stressing melody rather than complex harmony, and combined clean and often humorous right-hand lines with darker notes and chords in a near-perpetual left-hand rumble. His compositions similarly emphasized catchy melodies, but often also contained dissonant harmonies. Many of his varied repertoire of songs, including &quot;Doodlin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Peace&quot;, and &quot;Sister Sadie&quot;, became jazz standards that are still widely played. His considerable legacy encompasses his influence on other pianists and composers, and the development of young jazz talents who appeared in his bands over the course of four decades.

==Early life==
Silver was born on September 2, 1928, in Norwalk, Connecticut. His mother, Gertrude, was from Connecticut; his father, John Tavares Silver, was born on the island of Maio, Cape Verde, and emigrated to the United States as a young man. She was a maid and sang in a church choir; he worked for a tire company. Horace had a much older half-brother, Eugene Fletcher, from his mother&#x27;s first marriage, and was the third child for his parents, after John, who lived to six months, and Maria, who was stillborn.

Silver began playing the piano in his childhood and had classical music lessons. His father taught him the folk music of Cape Verde. At the age of 11, Silver became interested in becoming a musician, after hearing the Jimmie Lunceford orchestra. His early piano influences included the styles of boogie-woogie and the blues, the pianists Nat King Cole, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Art Tatum, and Teddy Wilson, as well as some jazz horn players.

Silver graduated from St. Mary&#x27;s Grammar School in 1943. From ninth grade, he played Lester Young-influenced tenor saxophone in the Norwalk High School band and orchestra. Silver played gigs locally on both piano and tenor saxophone while still at school. He was rejected for military service by a draft board examination that concluded that he had an excessively curved spine, which also interfered with his saxophone playing. Around 1946 he moved to Hartford, Connecticut, to take up a regular job as pianist in a nightclub.

==Later life and career==

===1950–55===
Silver&#x27;s break came in 1950, when his trio backed saxophonist Stan Getz at a club in Hartford: Getz liked Silver&#x27;s band and recruited them to tour with him. The saxophonist also gave Silver his recording debut, in December 1950, for a quartet date. After about a year, Silver was replaced as pianist in Getz&#x27;s band and he moved to New York City. There, working as a freelance, he quickly built a reputation, based on his compositions and bluesy playing. He worked for short periods with tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins, before meeting altoist Lou Donaldson, with whom he developed his bebop understanding. Donaldson made his first recording on Blue Note Records in 1952, with Silver on piano, Gene Ramey on bass and Art Taylor on drums. Later that year, another Blue Note quartet session was booked for Donaldson, with Art Blakey replacing Taylor, but the saxophonist withdrew and producer–owner Alfred Lion offered Silver the studio time for a trio recording. Most of the tracks recorded at it were Silver originals, and he went on to stay with Blue Note as a leader for the following 28 years.

Silver was also busy recording as a sideman. In 1953, he was pianist on sessions led by Sonny Stitt, Howard McGhee, and Al Cohn, and, the following year, he played on albums by Art Farmer, Miles Davis, Milt Jackson and others. Silver won the &quot;Down Beat&quot; critics&#x27; new star award for piano players in 1954, and appeared at the first Newport Jazz Festival, substituting for John Lewis in the Modern Jazz Quartet. Silver&#x27;s early 1950s recordings demonstrate that Powell was a major pianistic influence, but this had waned by the middle of the decade.

In New York, Silver and Blakey co-founded the Jazz Messengers, a cooperatively-run group that initially recorded under various leaders and names. Their first two studio recordings, with Hank Mobley on tenor saxophone, Kenny Dorham on trumpet, and Doug Watkins on bass, were made in late 1954 and early 1955 and were released as two 10-inch albums under Silver&#x27;s name, then soon thereafter as the 12-inch &quot;Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers&quot;. This album contained Silver&#x27;s first hit, &quot;The Preacher&quot;. Unusually in Silver&#x27;s career, recordings of concert performances were also released at this time, involving quintets at Birdland (1954) and the Café Bohemia (1955). This set of studio and concert recordings was pivotal in the development and defining of hard bop, which combined elements of blues, gospel, and R&amp;B, with bebop-based harmony and rhythm. The new, funky hard bop was commercially popular, and helped to establish Blue Note as a successful business.

===1956–69===
Silver&#x27;s final recordings with the Jazz Messengers were in May 1956. Later that year, he left Blakey after one and a half years, in part because of the heroin use prevalent in the band, which Silver did not want to be involved in. Soon after leaving, Silver formed his own long-term quintet, after receiving offers of work from club owners who had heard his albums. The first line-up was Mobley (tenor saxophone), Farmer (trumpet), Watkins (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums). The quintet, with various line-ups, continued to record, helping Silver to build his reputation. He wrote almost all of the material the band played; one of these, &quot;Señor Blues&quot;, &quot;officially put Horace Silver on the map&quot;, in the view of critic Scott Yanow. In concert, Silver &quot;won over the crowds through his affable personality and all-action approach. He crouched over the piano as the sweat poured out, with his forelock brushing the keys and his feet pounding.&quot;

After more than a dozen sideman recording sessions in 1955 and a similar number in 1956–57, Silver&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Sonny Rollins, Vol. 2&quot; in April 1957 was his last for another leader, as he opted to concentrate on his own band. For several years from the late 1950s, this contained Junior Cook (tenor saxophone), Blue Mitchell (trumpet), Gene Taylor (bass), and either Hayes or Roy Brooks (drums). Their first album was &quot;Finger Poppin&#x27;&quot;, in 1959. Silver&#x27;s tour of Japan early in 1962 led to the album &quot;The Tokyo Blues&quot;, recorded later that year. By the early 1960s, Silver&#x27;s quintet had influenced numerous bandleaders and was among the most popular performers at jazz clubs. They also released singles, including &quot;Blowin&#x27; the Blues Away&quot;, &quot;Juicy Lucy&quot;, and &quot;Sister Sadie&quot;, for jukebox and radio play. This quintet&#x27;s sixth and final album was &quot;Silver&#x27;s Serenade&quot;, in 1963.

Around this time, Silver composed music for a television commercial for the drink Tab. Early in 1964, Silver visited Brazil for three weeks, an experience he credited with increasing his interest in his heritage. In the same year, he created a new quintet, featuring Joe Henderson on tenor saxophone and Carmell Jones on trumpet. This band recorded most of Silver&#x27;s best-known album, &quot;Song for My Father&quot;, which reached No. 95 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1965, and was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Recordings and personnel changes – sometimes expanding the band to a sextet – continued in the mid-1960s. In 1966, &quot;The Cape Verdean Blues&quot; charted at No. 130. The liner notes to the album &quot;Serenade to a Soul Sister&quot; (1968) included lyrics (written but not sung), indicating a new interest for Silver. His quintet, by then including saxophonist Bennie Maupin, trumpeter Randy Brecker, bassist John Williams, and drummer Billy Cobham, toured parts of Europe in October and November 1968, sponsored by the U.S. government. They also recorded one of Silver&#x27;s last quintet albums for Blue Note, &quot;You Gotta Take a Little Love&quot;. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot;&#x27;s retrospective summary of Silver&#x27;s main Blue Note recordings was that they were of a consistently high standard: &quot;each album yields one or two themes that haunt the mind, each usually has a particularly pretty ballad, and they all lay back on a deep pile of solid riffs and workmanlike solos.&quot;

===1970–80===
At the end of 1970, Silver broke up his regular band, to concentrate on composing and to spend more time with his wife. He had met Barbara Jean Dove in 1968 and married her two years later. They had a son, Gregory. Silver also became increasingly interested in spiritualism from the early 1970s.

Silver included lyrics in more of his compositions at this point, although these were sometimes regarded as doggerel or proselytizing. The first album to contain vocals, &quot;That Healin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; (1970), was commercially unsuccessful and Silver had to insist on the support of Blue Note executives to continue releasing music of the same, new style. They agreed to a further two albums that contained vocals and Silver on an RMI electric keyboard; the three were later compiled as &quot;The United States of Mind&quot;, but were soon dropped from the catalog.

Silver reformed a touring band in 1973. This contained brothers Michael and Randy Brecker. Around this time, according to saxophonist Dave Liebman, Silver&#x27;s reputation among aspiring young jazz musicians was that he was &quot;a little – not commercial, but not quite the real deal [in jazz].&quot; Silver and his family decided to move to California around 1974, after a burglary at their New York City apartment while they were in Europe. The couple divorced in the mid-1970s.

In 1975, he recorded &quot;Silver &#x27;n Brass&quot;, the first of five &quot;Silver &#x27;n&quot; albums, which had other instruments added to the quintet. The personnel in his band continued to change, and continued to contain young musicians who made telling contributions. One of these was trumpeter Tom Harrell, who stayed from 1973 to 1977. Silver&#x27;s pattern in the late 1970s was to tour for six months a year. His final Blue Note album was &quot;Silver &#x27;n Strings&quot;, recorded in 1978 and 1979. His stay was the longest in the label&#x27;s history. By Silver&#x27;s account, he left Blue Note after its parent company was sold and the new owners were not interested in promoting jazz. In 1980, he formed the record label Silveto, &quot;dedicated to the spiritual, holistic, self-help elements in music&quot;, he commented. Silver also formed Emerald at the same time, a label for straight-ahead jazz, but it was short-lived.

===1981–98===

The first Silveto release was &quot;Guides to Growing Up&quot; in 1981, which contained recitations from actor and comedian Bill Cosby. Silver stated in the same year that he had reduced his touring to four months a year, so that he could spend more time with his son. This also meant that he had to audition for new band members on an annual basis. He continued to write lyrics for his new albums, although these were not always included on the recordings themselves. The song titles reflected his spiritual, self-help thinking; for example, &quot;Spiritualizing the Senses&quot; from 1983 included &quot;Seeing with Perception&quot; and &quot;Moving Forward with Confidence&quot;. The next albums were &quot;There&#x27;s No Need to Struggle&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Continuity of Spirit&quot; (1985). His band for performances in the UK and elsewhere in 1987 included trumpeter Dave Douglas and saxophonist Vincent Herring. Douglas reported that Silver seldom gave direct verbal guidelines about the music, preferring to lead through playing. A revival of interest in more traditional forms of jazz in the 1980s largely passed Silver by, and his albums on Silveto were not critical successes. Its last release was &quot;Music to Ease Your Disease&quot;, in 1988. By the early 1990s Silver did not often play at jazz festivals, but his need to tour was limited, as he received steady royalties from his songbook.

&quot;Rockin&#x27; with Rachmaninoff&quot;, a musical work featuring dancers and narration, written by Silver and choreographed and directed by Donald McKayle, was staged in Los Angeles in 1991. A recording of the work was released on Bop City Records in 2003. After a decade of trying to make his independent label work, Silver abandoned it in 1993, and signed to Columbia Records. This also signalled a return to mostly instrumental releases. The first of these, &quot;It&#x27;s Got to Be Funky&quot;, was a rare big band album. Silver came close to dying soon after its release: he was hospitalized with a previously undiagnosed blood clot problem, but went on to record &quot;Pencil Packin&#x27; Papa&quot;, containing a six-piece brass section, in 1994. That year, he also played as a guest on Dee Dee Bridgewater&#x27;s album &quot;Love and Peace: A Tribute to Horace Silver&quot;.
Silver received a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award in 1995, and in the following year was added to &quot;Down Beat&quot;″s Jazz Hall of Fame and received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. He moved from Columbia to Impulse! Records, where he made the septet &quot;The Hardbop Grandpop&quot; (1996) and the quintet &quot;A Prescription for the Blues&quot; (1997). The former was nominated for two Grammy Awards: as an album for best instrumental performance, individual or group; and for Silver&#x27;s solo on &quot;Diggin&#x27; on Dexter&quot;. He was again unwell in 1997, so was unable to tour to promote his records. His final studio recording was made in the following year – &quot;Jazz Has a Sense of Humor&quot;, for Verve Records. One continuation from his early career was that Silver recorded his own compositions for his later albums and they were typically new, rather than re-workings of previous releases.

===1999–2014===
Silver performed in public for the first time in four years in 2004, appearing with an octet at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York. He was rarely seen in public after this. In 2005, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded him its President&#x27;s Merit Award. In 2006, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to the Nitty Gritty: The Autobiography of Horace Silver&quot;, was published by the University of California Press. A 2008 release, &quot;Live at Newport &#x27;58&quot;, from a Silver concert fifty years earlier, reached the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s jazz chart.

In 2007, it was revealed that Silver had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died of natural causes in New Rochelle, New York, on June 18, 2014, aged 85. He was survived by his son.

==Playing style==
Silver&#x27;s early recordings displayed &quot;a crisp, chipper but slightly wayward style, idiosyncratic enough to take him out of the increasingly stratified realms of bebop&quot;. In contrast to the more elaborate bebop piano, he stressed straightforward melodies rather than complex harmonies, and included short riffs and motifs that came and went over the course of a solo. While his right hand provided cleanly played lines, his left added bouncy, darker notes and chords in a near-perpetual rumble. Silver &quot;always played percussively, rarely suggesting excessive force on the keys but mustering a crisp [...] sound.&quot; His fingering was idiosyncratic, but this added to the individuality of his pianism, particularly to the authenticity of the blues facets of his playing. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; gave the overall assessment that &quot;Blues and gospel-tinged devices and percussive attacks give his methods a more colourful style, and a generous good humour gives all his records an upbeat feel.&quot; Part of the humor was Silver&#x27;s predilection for quoting other pieces of music in his own playing.

Writer and academic Thomas Owens stated that characteristics of Silver&#x27;s solos were: &quot;the short, simple phrases that all derive from the three-beat figure ♩ ♩ | ♩, or a variant of it; the pianist&#x27;s &#x27;blue fifth&#x27; (those rapid slurs up to [... a flattened fifth]); and the low tone cluster used strictly as a rhythmic punctuation&quot;. He also employed blues and minor pentatonic scales. Music journalist Marc Myers observed that &quot;Silver&#x27;s advantage was pianistic grace and a keen awareness that by resolving dark, minor-passages in airy, ascending and descending major-key chord configurations, the result could produce an exciting and uplifting feeling.&quot; In his accompanying of a soloing saxophonist or trumpeter, Silver was also distinctive: &quot;Rather than reacting to the soloist&#x27;s melody and waiting for melodic holes to fill, he typically plays background patterns similar to the background riffs that saxes or brasses play behind soloists in big bands.&quot;

==Compositions==
Early in his career, Silver composed contrafacts and blues-based melodies (including &quot;Doodlin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Opus de Funk&quot;). The latter was &quot;a typical Silver creation: advanced in its harmonic structure and general approach but with a catchy tune and finger-snapping beat.&quot; His innovative incorporation of gospel and blues sounds into jazz compositions took place while they were also being added to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and R&amp;B pieces.

Silver soon expanded the range and style of his writing, which grew to include &quot;funky groove tunes, gentle mood pieces, vamp songs, outings in 3/4 and 6/8 time, Latin workouts of various stripes, up-tempo jam numbers, and examples of almost any and every other kind of approach congruent with the hard bop aesthetic.&quot; An unusual case is &quot;Peace&quot;, a ballad that prioritizes a calm mood over melodic or harmonic effects. Owens observed that &quot;Many of his compositions contain no folk blues or gospel music elements, but instead have highly chromatic melodies supported by richly dissonant harmonies&quot;. The compositions and arrangements were also designed to make Silver&#x27;s typical line-up sound larger than a quintet.

Silver himself commented that inspiration came from multiple sources: &quot;I&#x27;m inspired by nature and by some of the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life. I&#x27;m inspired by my mentors. I&#x27;m inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind just before I wake up. Others I get from just doodlin&#x27; around on the piano&quot;. He also wrote that, &quot;when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==
Silver was among the most influential jazz musicians of his lifetime. &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; describes his legacy as at least fourfold: as a pioneer of hard bop; as a user of what became the archetypal quintet instrumentation of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums; as a developer of young musicians who went on to become important players and bandleaders; and for his skill as a composer and arranger.

Silver was also an influence as a pianist: his first Blue Note recording as leader &quot;redefined the jazz piano, which up until then was largely modeled on the dexterity and relentless attack of Bud Powell&quot;, in Myers&#x27; words. As early as 1956, Silver&#x27;s piano playing was described by &quot;Down Beat&quot; as &quot;a key influence on a large segment of modern jazz pianists.&quot; This went on to include Ramsey Lewis, Les McCann, Bobby Timmons, and Cecil Taylor, who was impressed by Silver&#x27;s aggressive style.

Silver&#x27;s legacy as a composer may be greater than as a pianist, because his works, many of which are jazz standards, continue to be performed and recorded worldwide. As a composer, he led a return to an emphasis on melody, observed critic John S. Wilson: for a long time, jazz musicians had written contrafacts of great technical complexity, but &quot;Silver wrote originals that were not only actually original but memorably melodic, presaging a gradual return to melodic creativity among writing jazzmen.&quot;

<text>Minga y Petraca (later known as &quot;Minga y Tomasa&quot;) was a television show produced in Puerto Rico by Antonio &quot;El Gangster&quot; Sanchez since 1992 up until early 2005 on Telemundo Puerto Rico, channel 2.

Sanchez and actor Johnny Ray Rodríguez played &quot;Minga&quot; and &quot;Petraca&quot; (respectively), two middle aged, mustached &quot;ladies&quot; who dedicate themselves to reading such magazines as &quot;Vea&quot;, &quot;Teve Guia&quot; and other popular Puerto Rican gossip magazines. They commented on the stories published, making fun of the articles. After reading magazine articles, they would get into comedic situations with their friends, husbands and families. Their husbands have never actually been shown on the show, only their voices are heard. Minga and Petraca are from the Santurce area of San Juan.

&quot;Minga y Petraca&quot; reached such popularity in Puerto Rico that there was even a CD released with the two characters as main stars. The song &quot;Estoy Escriquillá!!&quot; (loosely translated into &quot;I&#x27;m tired&quot;) was a big hit during Christmas of 1993 on Puerto Rico&#x27;s radio.

Ray moved to the United States and with that, he took his character of &quot;Petraca&quot;. Sanchez decided that &quot;the show must go on&quot;, and changed the show&#x27;s name to &quot;Minga y Tomasa&quot;. He hired a new actor, Alex Soto, to play &quot;Minga&quot;&#x27;s new friend, &quot;Tomasa&quot;. Ray flies to Puerto Rico on and off to tape shows, and his character &quot;Petraca&quot; is now a visitor from the United States to &quot;Minga&quot;.

In March 2005, the show was cancelled because Telemundo wanted to open a new telenovela spot at 9:00 p.m., so axed all sitcoms and programs in that time slot, only leaving Sanchez&#x27;s No Te Duermas, as a daily show.

In January 2008, the Minga character got new life as part of a weekly segment on &quot;Minga&#x27;s Tokchou (Minga&#x27;s Talk Show in Spanglish).&quot; In her segment, male guests dress as females while female guests dress as males.

On February 27, 2011, a Minga y Petraca reunion show aired on Telemundo Puerto Rico.

<doc id="238181" wikidata="Q334631" url="?curid=238181" title="Gibbs free energy">
<text>In thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy (or Gibbs energy as the recommended name; symbol is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum amount of work, other than pressure–volume work, that may be performed by a thermodynamically closed system at constant temperature and pressure. It also provides a necessary condition for processes such as chemical reactions that may occur under these conditions. The Gibbs free energy is expressed as
formula_1
where:
* formula_2 is the internal energy of the system
* formula_3 is the enthalpy of the system
* formula_4 is the entropy of the system
* formula_5 is the temperature of the system
* formula_6 is the volume of the system
* formula_7 is the pressure of the system (which must be equal to that of the surroundings for mechanical equilibrium).

The Gibbs free energy change (, measured in joules in SI) is the &quot;maximum&quot; amount of non-volume expansion work that can be extracted from a closed system (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter) at fixed temperature and pressure. This maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process. When a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state under these conditions, the decrease in Gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings, minus the work of the pressure forces.

The Gibbs energy is the thermodynamic potential that is minimized when a system reaches chemical equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature when not driven by an applied electrolytic voltage. Its derivative with respect to the reaction coordinate of the system then vanishes at the equilibrium point. As such, a reduction in formula_8 is necessary for a reaction to be spontaneous under these conditions.

The concept of Gibbs free energy, originally called &quot;available energy&quot;, was developed in the 1870s by the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs. In 1873, Gibbs described this &quot;available energy&quot; as
The initial state of the body, according to Gibbs, is supposed to be such that &quot;the body can be made to pass from it to states of dissipated energy by reversible processes&quot;. In his 1876 magnum opus &quot;On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances&quot;, a graphical analysis of multi-phase chemical systems, he engaged his thoughts on chemical-free energy in full.

If the reactants and products are all in their thermodynamic standard states, then the defining equation is written as , where &quot;formula_9&quot; is enthalpy, formula_10 is absolute temperature, and &quot;formula_11&quot; is entropy.

== Overview ==
According to the second law of thermodynamics, for systems reacting at fixed temperature and pressure without input of non-&quot;Pressure Volume&quot; (pV) work, there is a general natural tendency to achieve a minimum of the Gibbs free energy.

A quantitative measure of the favorability of a given reaction under these conditions is the change Δ&quot;G&quot; (sometimes written &quot;delta &quot;G&quot;&quot; or &quot;d&quot;G&quot;&quot;) in Gibbs free energy that is (or would be) caused by the reaction. As a necessary condition for the reaction to occur at constant temperature and pressure, Δ&quot;G&quot; must be smaller than the non-pressure-volume (non-&quot;pV&quot;, e.g. electrical) work, which is often equal to zero (then Δ&quot;G&quot; must be negative). Δ&quot;G&quot; equals the maximum amount of non-&quot;pV&quot; work that can be performed as a result of the chemical reaction for the case of a reversible process. If analysis indicates a positive Δ&quot;G&quot; for a reaction, then energy — in the form of electrical or other non-&quot;pV&quot; work — would have to be added to the reacting system for Δ&quot;G&quot; to be smaller than the non-&quot;pV&quot; work and make it possible for the reaction to occur.

One can think of ∆G as the amount of &quot;free&quot; or &quot;useful&quot; energy available to do non-&quot;pV&quot; work at constant temperature and pressure. The equation can be also seen from the perspective of the system taken together with its surroundings (the rest of the universe). First, one assumes that the given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the only one that is occurring. Then the entropy released or absorbed by the system equals the entropy that the environment must absorb or release, respectively. The reaction will only be allowed if the total entropy change of the universe is zero or positive. This is reflected in a negative Δ&quot;G&quot;, and the reaction is called an exergonic process.

If two chemical reactions are coupled, then an otherwise endergonic reaction (one with positive Δ&quot;G&quot;) can be made to happen. The input of heat into an inherently endergonic reaction, such as the elimination of cyclohexanol to cyclohexene, can be seen as coupling an unfavorable reaction (elimination) to a favorable one (burning of coal or other provision of heat) such that the total entropy change of the universe is greater than or equal to zero, making the &quot;total&quot; Gibbs free energy change of the coupled reactions negative.

In traditional use, the term &quot;free&quot; was included in &quot;Gibbs free energy&quot; to mean &quot;available in the form of useful work&quot;. The characterization becomes more precise if we add the qualification that it is the energy available for non-pressure-volume work. (An analogous, but slightly different, meaning of &quot;free&quot; applies in conjunction with the Helmholtz free energy, for systems at constant temperature). However, an increasing number of books and journal articles do not include the attachment &quot;free&quot;, referring to &quot;G&quot; as simply &quot;Gibbs energy&quot;. This is the result of a 1988 IUPAC meeting to set unified terminologies for the international scientific community, in which the removal of the adjective &quot;free&quot; was recommended. This standard, however, has not yet been universally adopted.

The name &quot;free enthalpy&quot; was also used for &quot;G&quot; in the past.

== History ==

The quantity called &quot;free energy&quot; is a more advanced and accurate replacement for the outdated term &quot;affinity&quot;, which was used by chemists in the earlier years of physical chemistry to describe the &quot;force&quot; that caused chemical reactions.

In 1873, Josiah Willard Gibbs published &quot;A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces&quot;, in which he sketched the principles of his new equation that was able to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue when bodies or systems are brought into contact. By studying the interactions of homogeneous substances in contact, i.e., bodies composed of part solid, part liquid, and part vapor, and by using a three-dimensional volume-entropy-internal energy graph, Gibbs was able to determine three states of equilibrium, i.e., &quot;necessarily stable&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, and &quot;unstable&quot;, and whether or not changes would ensue. Further, Gibbs stated:

In this description, as used by Gibbs, &quot;ε&quot; refers to the internal energy of the body, &quot;η&quot; refers to the entropy of the body, and &quot;ν&quot; is the volume of the body...

Thereafter, in 1882, the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz characterized the affinity as the largest quantity of work which can be gained when the reaction is carried out in a reversible manner, e.g., electrical work in a reversible cell. The maximum work is thus regarded as the diminution of the free, or available, energy of the system (&quot;Gibbs free energy&quot; &quot;G&quot; at &quot;T&quot; = constant, &quot;P&quot; = constant or &quot;Helmholtz free energy&quot; &quot;F&quot; at &quot;T&quot; = constant, &quot;V&quot; = constant), whilst the heat given out is usually a measure of the diminution of the total energy of the system (internal energy). Thus, &quot;G&quot; or &quot;F&quot; is the amount of energy &quot;free&quot; for work under the given conditions.

Until this point, the general view had been such that: &quot;all chemical reactions drive the system to a state of equilibrium in which the affinities of the reactions vanish&quot;. Over the next 60 years, the term affinity came to be replaced with the term free energy. According to chemistry historian Henry Leicester, the influential 1923 textbook &quot;Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances&quot; by Gilbert N. Lewis and Merle Randall led to the replacement of the term &quot;affinity&quot; by the term &quot;free energy&quot; in much of the English-speaking world.

== Definitions ==

The Gibbs free energy is defined as
formula_12
which is the same as
formula_13
where:
* &quot;U&quot; is the internal energy (SI unit: joule),
* &quot;p&quot; is pressure (SI unit: pascal),
* &quot;V&quot; is volume (SI unit: m3),
* &quot;T&quot; is the temperature (SI unit: kelvin),
* &quot;S&quot; is the entropy (SI unit: joule per kelvin),
* &quot;H&quot; is the enthalpy (SI unit: joule).
The expression for the infinitesimal reversible change in the Gibbs free energy as a function of its &quot;natural variables&quot; &quot;p&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, for an open system, subjected to the operation of external forces (for instance, electrical or magnetic) &quot;Xi&quot;, which cause the external parameters of the system &quot;ai&quot; to change by an amount d&quot;ai&quot;, can be derived as follows from the first law for reversible processes:
formula_14
where:
* &quot;μ&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the chemical potential of the &quot;i&quot;th chemical component. (SI unit: joules per particle or joules per mole)
* &quot;N&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the number of particles (or number of moles) composing the &quot;i&quot;th chemical component.

This is one form of the Gibbs fundamental equation. In the infinitesimal expression, the term involving the chemical potential accounts for changes in Gibbs free energy resulting from an influx or outflux of particles. In other words, it holds for an open system or for a closed, chemically reacting system where the &quot;Ni&quot; are changing. For a closed, non-reacting system, this term may be dropped.

Any number of extra terms may be added, depending on the particular system being considered. Aside from mechanical work, a system may, in addition, perform numerous other types of work. For example, in the infinitesimal expression, the contractile work energy associated with a thermodynamic system that is a contractile fiber that shortens by an amount −d&quot;l&quot; under a force &quot;f&quot; would result in a term &quot;f&quot; d&quot;l&quot; being added. If a quantity of charge −d&quot;e&quot; is acquired by a system at an electrical potential Ψ, the electrical work associated with this is −Ψ d&quot;e&quot;, which would be included in the infinitesimal expression. Other work terms are added on per system requirements.

Each quantity in the equations above can be divided by the amount of substance, measured in moles, to form &quot;molar Gibbs free energy&quot;. The Gibbs free energy is one of the most important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system. It is a factor in determining outcomes such as the voltage of an electrochemical cell, and the equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction. In isothermal, isobaric systems, Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a &quot;dynamic&quot; quantity, in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the enthalpic and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process.

The temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy for an ideal gas is given by the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation, and its pressure dependence is given by
formula_15
or more conveniently as its chemical potential:
formula_16

In non-ideal systems, fugacity comes into play.

== Derivation ==
The Gibbs free energy total differential with respect to natural variables may be derived by Legendre transforms of the internal energy.
: formula_17

The definition of &quot;G&quot; from above is
: formula_18.

Taking the total differential, we have
: formula_19

Replacing d&quot;U&quot; with the result from the first law gives
: formula_20

The natural variables of &quot;G&quot; are then &quot;p&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, and {&quot;N&quot;&quot;i&quot;}.

=== Homogeneous systems ===

Because &quot;S&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;N&quot;&quot;i&quot; are extensive variables, an Euler relation allows easy integration of d&quot;U&quot;:
: formula_21

Because some of the natural variables of &quot;G&quot; are intensive, d&quot;G&quot; may not be integrated using Euler relations as is the case with internal energy. However, simply substituting the above integrated result for &quot;U&quot; into the definition of &quot;G&quot; gives a standard expression for &quot;G&quot;:
: formula_22

This result shows that the chemical potential of a substance &quot;formula_23&quot; is its (partial) mol(ecul)ar Gibbs free energy. It applies to homogeneous, macroscopic systems, but not to all thermodynamic systems.

== Gibbs free energy of reactions ==
The system under consideration is held at constant temperature and pressure, and is closed (no matter can come in or out). The Gibbs energy of any system is and an infinitesimal change in &quot;G&quot;, at constant temperature and pressure, yields
: formula_24

By the first law of thermodynamics, a change in the internal energy &quot;U&quot; is given by
: formula_25
where is energy added as heat, and is energy added as work. The work done on the system may be written as , where is the mechanical work of compression/expansion done on or by the system and is all other forms of work, which may include electrical, magnetic, etc. Then
: formula_26
and the infinitesimal change in &quot;G&quot; is
: formula_27

The second law of thermodynamics states that for a closed system at constant temperature (in a heat bath), and so it follows that
: formula_28

Assuming that only mechanical work is done, this simplifies to
: formula_29

This means that for such a system when not in equilibrium, the Gibbs energy will always be decreasing, and in equilibrium, the infinitesimal change &quot;dG&quot; will be zero. In particular, this will be true if the system is experiencing any number of internal chemical reactions on its path to equilibrium.

=== In electrochemical thermodynamics ===
When electric charge &quot;dQ&quot;ele is passed between the electrodes of an electrochemical cell generating an emf formula_30, an electrical work term appears in the expression for the change in Gibbs energy:
formula_31
where &quot;S&quot; is the entropy, &quot;V&quot; is the system volume, &quot;p&quot; is its pressure and &quot;T&quot; is its absolute temperature.

The combination (formula_30, &quot;Qele&quot;) is an example of a conjugate pair of variables. At constant pressure the above equation produces a Maxwell relation that links the change in open cell voltage with temperature &quot;T&quot; (a measurable quantity) to the change in entropy &quot;S&quot; when charge is passed isothermally and isobarically. The latter is closely related to the reaction entropy of the electrochemical reaction that lends the battery its power. This Maxwell relation is:
: formula_33

If a mole of ions goes into solution (for example, in a Daniell cell, as discussed below) the charge through the external circuit is
: formula_34
where &quot;n&quot;0 is the number of electrons/ion, and &quot;F&quot;0 is the Faraday constant and the minus sign indicates discharge of the cell. Assuming constant pressure and volume, the thermodynamic properties of the cell are related strictly to the behavior of its emf by
: formula_35
where Δ&quot;H&quot; is the enthalpy of reaction. The quantities on the right are all directly measurable.

== Useful identities to derive the Nernst equation ==
During a reversible electrochemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure, the following equations involving the Gibbs free energy hold:
* formula_36 (see chemical equilibrium),
* formula_37 (for a system at chemical equilibrium),
* formula_38 (for a reversible electrochemical process at constant temperature and pressure),
* formula_39 (definition of formula_40),
and rearranging gives
formula_41
which relates the cell potential resulting from the reaction to the equilibrium constant and reaction quotient for that reaction (Nernst equation),
where
* , Gibbs free energy change per mole of reaction,
* , Gibbs free energy change per mole of reaction for unmixed reactants and products at standard conditions (i.e. 298K, 100kPa, 1M of each reactant and product),
* , gas constant,
* , absolute temperature,
* , natural logarithm,
* , reaction quotient (unitless),
* , equilibrium constant (unitless),
* , electrical work in a reversible process (chemistry sign convention),
* , number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction,
* , Faraday constant (charge per mole of electrons),
* formula_30, cell potential,
* formula_40, standard cell potential.

Moreover, we also have
formula_44
which relates the equilibrium constant with Gibbs free energy. This implies that at equilibrium
formula_45 and formula_46

== Standard Gibbs energy change of formation ==

The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of a compound is the change of Gibbs free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 mole of that substance from its component elements, in their standard states (the most stable form of the element at 25 °C and 100 kPa). Its symbol is Δ&quot;f&quot;&quot;G&quot;˚.

All elements in their standard states (diatomic oxygen gas, graphite, etc.) have standard Gibbs free energy change of formation equal to zero, as there is no change involved.
: Δf&quot;G&quot; = Δ&quot;f&quot;&quot;G&quot;˚ + &quot;RT&quot; ln &quot;Qf&quot;,
where &quot;Qf&quot; is the reaction quotient.

At equilibrium, Δ&quot;f&quot;&quot;G&quot; = 0, and &quot;Qf&quot; = &quot;K&quot;, so the equation becomes
: Δ&quot;f&quot;&quot;G&quot;˚ = −&quot;RT&quot; ln &quot;K&quot;,
where &quot;K&quot; is the equilibrium constant of the formation reaction of the substance from the elements in their standard states.

== Graphical interpretation by Gibbs ==
Gibbs free energy was originally defined graphically. In 1873, American scientist Willard Gibbs published his first thermodynamics paper, &quot;Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids&quot;, in which Gibbs used the two coordinates of the entropy and volume to represent the state of the body. In his second follow-up paper, &quot;A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces&quot;, published later that year, Gibbs added in the third coordinate of the energy of the body, defined on three figures. In 1874, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell used Gibbs&#x27; figures to make a 3D energy-entropy-volume thermodynamic surface of a fictitious water-like substance. Thus, in order to understand the concept of Gibbs free energy, it may help to understand its interpretation by Gibbs as section AB on his figure 3, and as Maxwell sculpted that section on his 3D surface figure.

<text>Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour was a BBC radio comedy, and later television comedy series, broadcast from 1954 to 1961 and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. The radio series starred Tony Hancock, with Sidney James, Bill Kerr and,at various times, Moira Lister, Andrée Melly, Hattie Jacques, and Kenneth Williams. The television series also featured Sidney James with regular appearances from John Le Mesurier, Hugh Lloyd, Warren Mitchell, Liz Fraser and Patricia Hayes. In the final television series, renamed simply &quot;Hancock&quot;, the supporting cast included established actors such as Jack Watling and Patrick Cargill. 

Hancock played an exaggerated and much poorer version of his own character and lifestyle, Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock, a down-at-heel comedian living at the dilapidated 23 Railway Cuttings in East Cheam. The series was influential in the development of the situation comedy, with its move away from radio variety towards a focus on character development. The radio version was produced by Dennis Main Wilson for most of its run. After Main Wilson departed for his television career, his role was taken by Tom Ronald. The television series was produced by Duncan Wood. The distinctive tuba-based theme tune was composed by Wally Stott.

Ten scripts (nine TV, one radio) were written but never recorded for a variety of reasons. The unused radio script for &quot;The Counterfeiter&quot; was finally recorded in 2019 with Kevin R. McNally as Tony Hancock.

==Radio series==

===Development===
The radio series broke with the variety tradition which was then dominant in British radio comedy, highlighting a new genre: the sitcom or situation comedy. Instead of the traditional variety mix of sketches, guest stars and musical interludes, the show&#x27;s humour derived from characters and situations developed in a half-hour storyline. This then relatively novel format, of what was in effect a single sketch each week lasting the entire half-hour (though in the radio version James and the others sometimes played different roles), was reflected in the show&#x27;s title, which aptly described the series as Hancock&#x27;s &quot;half-hour&quot;.

Roger Wilmut, in his 1978 book about Tony Hancock as a performer, credits two British radio comedy shows, already running in 1954, with establishing an uninterrupted 30-minute sitcom format: &quot;A Life of Bliss&quot;, written by Godfrey Harrison and starring George Cole, and &quot;Life with the Lyons&quot;, a programme heavily based on the US tradition of sitcoms; he therefore dismisses the notion that Galton and Simpson invented the genre.

The comedy gradually shifted to observation, with a less strong emphasis on a narrative. The playlet &quot;Look Back in Hunger&quot; (spoofing John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;) in the episode &quot;The East Cheam Drama Festival&quot; from the fifth series, showed that writers Galton and Simpson were in touch with developments in the British theatre, in the use of sighs and silent pauses, something Osborne&#x27;s style had in common with the plays of Harold Pinter, whose work began to emerge towards the end of the series&#x27; run. In addition, the measured pacing of the episodes was unusual in an era of fast-talking radio comedians, such as Ted Ray, who typically used a machine-gun style of delivery to fill every single second of airtime.

===Setting===
Hancock&#x27;s character had various addresses, but by the third radio series he had arrived at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam. Sometimes this was portrayed as a council house, but occasionally there was a private landlord. In a few early episodes Hancock owned the house, and later this became the norm. The episode &quot;Cinderella Hancock&quot; saw a reverse of the norm with Hancock a lodger in a house owned by Bill Kerr.

The house changed to accommodate the cast: in some episodes it appeared to be a two-bedroom terraced house, with Kerr as Hancock&#x27;s lodger; but in series four and five it had at least three bedrooms, as Miss Pugh was also resident in some episodes. In others she &#x27;came round&#x27; each day, presumably from her own domicile. Railway Cuttings and East Cheam were fictitious, but Cheam is a real town, once in Surrey, today part of the London Borough of Sutton in Greater London. The whole area is smart and expensive, and by creating &#x27;Railway Cuttings, East Cheam&#x27; Galton and Simpson created an address for a snob who wanted to live in a &#x27;posh&#x27; area, but could only afford the &#x27;cheap end&#x27; (which in reality does not exist). In those days recordings of the radio shows were not commercially available, so the audience had to rely entirely on memory for details of who lived where or who did what in the show.

Commissioning of series in the UK was then closer to American practice with extensive runs not unknown, but in this case, with only two writers, continuity was yet to develop, and details changed to suit each episode. The domestic situation varied, but Hancock usually portrayed a &#x27;resting&#x27; or hopeless down-at-heel actor and/or comedian (though some episodes showed him having runs of success, while some episodes depict him pursuing professional careers as fantasies), James was always on the fiddle in some way, Kerr gradually became dim and virtually unemployable (although he had started out as a fast-talking American-style Australian), and Hancock&#x27;s &#x27;secretary&#x27;, Miss Pugh, had such a loose job description that in one celebrated episode she had cooked the Sunday lunch.

At times the scripts would include topical realities of British life, such as the reintroduction of petrol rationing from November 1956 to March 1957 (following the Suez Crisis) in &#x27;The Stolen Petrol&#x27; and a strike by members of the trade union ASLEF (Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen) from 28 May to 14 June 1955 which involved a railway strike in &#x27;The Rail Strike&#x27;.

===Radio series cast===
* Tony Hancock as Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock, principal character.
* The comedy actor Sidney James (as he was then billed) played Sid (full name Sidney Balmoral James), a criminally-inclined confidant of Hancock, who usually succeeded in conning him each week.
* Bill Kerr appeared as Hancock&#x27;s Australian lodger (full name William Montmorency Beaumont Kerr), a character who became noticeably dim-witted in the later shows. Often refers to Hancock as &quot;Tub&quot;.
* Kenneth Williams, taking his first job in comedy, provided the funny voices for nearly all of the minor characters in the show each week. Williams left after the first recording session for the sixth series.
* Moira Lister appeared in the first series, before being replaced by Andrée Melly for the next two; both women played love interest for Hancock&#x27;s character, in essentially &#x27;straight&#x27; roles.
* In the fourth and fifth series Hattie Jacques provided comedy in the female role as the harridan Griselda Pugh, who was Hancock&#x27;s secretary and Sid&#x27;s occasional girlfriend. By this time, Hancock&#x27;s difficulties with women had become part of the characterisation.

Among the well-known actors who appeared in the series were Hugh Lloyd, Patricia Hayes, Dick Emery, Warren Mitchell, John Le Mesurier and Richard Wattis. Also appearing were Pat Coombs, Rolf Harris, Burt Kwouk (credited as &#x27;Burd Kwouk&#x27;), and Anne Reid.

Episodes of the radio series were included in 20 underground radio stations of the BBC&#x27;s Wartime Broadcasting Service (WTBS), designed to provide information and morale-boosting broadcasts for 100 days after a nuclear attack.

===Radio series episodes===
Most of the radio episodes were recorded between one day and three weeks in advance of broadcast, except for Series 6 which was mostly recorded during a three-week period in June 1959 in order to avoid clashing with the recording of Series 5 of the television show.

Galton and Simpson never gave titles to any of their Hancock scripts, for radio or television; this was usually left to the girl who filed the scripts at their office, who gave them names that were a reminder of what the script was about. So when Roger Wilmut came to write his book &quot;Tony Hancock – Artiste&quot; (first published 1978) he took the liberty of inventing titles where necessary and these titles, a combination of the file names and Wilmut&#x27;s own, have become the accepted ones ever since, with the approval of Galton and Simpson and the BBC.

The regular cast members generally played &quot;themselves&quot;, in that the characters were called by the actor&#x27;s real name (although the English actress Andrée Melly – sister of George – played a French character). However, there were exceptions:

* Kenneth Williams played a series of unnamed characters referred to in the scripts—but not on air—as &quot;Snide&quot;. He also played the very occasional roles of Edwardian Fred (a criminal associate of Sid&#x27;s) and Hancock&#x27;s Vicar, as well as various other characters (e.g. a judge). In the episode &quot;The Emigrant&quot; he is allowed to break the fourth wall and refer to himself as &quot;that bloke with the funny voice&quot;.
* Hattie Jacques played Griselda Pugh, Hancock&#x27;s secretary, with the exception of the episode &quot;The East Cheam Drama Festival&quot; where she played herself.
* Alan Simpson played an unnamed man in early episodes who listened patiently to Hancock&#x27;s long-winded stories. His lines would frequently be restricted to simply &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Really?&quot;, &quot;Mm-hmm&quot;, or &quot;I see&quot;.

These performers are present in the series as indicated below.

Episodes 2, 5, 7, 8 and 9 no longer exist. On 30 September 2022 it was announced that Richard Harrison of the Radio Circle had found the original recording of The Marriage Bureau, and Keith Wickham, also of the Radio Circle, had restored the edition. The episode aired on BBC Radio 4 for the first time since 1955 on 18 October 2022. This episode was particularly significant given it featured the only Hancock guest appearance by Peter Sellers.

In April 2014 the BBC started to re-record the lost episodes under the banner &quot;The Missing Hancocks&quot;, produced by Neil Pearson and Ed Morrish. The scripts for this five-episode run were selected by Galton and Simpson and recorded in their presence, with Kevin McNally taking the part of Tony Hancock. From the original first series they chose &quot;The Hancock Festival&quot;, which aired in November 2014, the sixtieth anniversary of its first airing. The project would eventually re-record all the missing episodes.

&quot;The Marriage Bureau&quot;, which was still missing at the time, was re-recorded in September 2015 and broadcast on 7 December 2015. &quot;The Department Store Santa&quot; was re-recorded on 3 September 2017 and broadcast in December 2018, opening the fourth series of &quot;The Missing Hancocks&quot;. On 24 September 2017 &quot;Christmas at Aldershot&quot; was re-recorded for broadcast on Christmas Day 2019 along with &quot;The Christmas Eve Party&quot; which was broadcast on 21 December 2021. &quot;The Diamond Ring&quot; was re-recorded on 11 January 2019 and broadcast (in keeping with its Guy Fawkes theme) on 5 November 2019.

One no longer extant episode (5) features the only &quot;Hancock&quot; guest appearance by Spike Milligan.

====Series 2 (1955)====
* 12 episodes, 17 April – 2 July 1955
* Regular cast: Harry Secombe (Episodes 1–4), Tony Hancock (Episodes 4–12), Bill Kerr, Sid James, Andrée Melly, Kenneth Williams, Alan Simpson (uncredited)

† Episodes 1, 2, 3, 7, 10 and 12 (half the series, including the first three of Harry Secombe&#x27;s guest appearances) no longer exist.

Shortly before the series was due to be recorded Hancock walked out on a theatre performance suffering from &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot; and flew to Rome. Harry Secombe was brought in at short notice to replace Hancock. Secombe starred in the first three episodes and made a guest appearance in the fourth, by which time Hancock had returned to complete the series as scheduled. The fourth episode, &quot;A Visit To Swansea&quot;, featured Tony being forced to go and thank Harry who&#x27;d returned to Wales, and was littered with references to how good Secombe had been. Had Hancock not returned when he did, then Galton and Simpson planned to replace him permanently with Secombe and rename the series &quot;Secombe&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;.

In April 2014, the BBC re-recorded &quot;The Matador&quot;, chosen by Galton and Simpson, for the first series of &quot;The Missing Hancocks&quot;. On 2 December 2016, the BBC re-recorded &quot;A Holiday in France&quot;, followed by &quot;The Race Horse&quot; and &quot;The Crown Jewels&quot; with Andy Secombe as his late father Harry. On 13 January 2019, &quot;Prime Minister Hancock&quot; was re-recorded for broadcast on 18 December that year. Also re-recorded was &quot;A Visit To Swansea&quot; which was then missing, as none of the Secombe episodes had been kept; however, on 11 October 2023. radio enthusiast Richard Harrison announced he had found an off-air copy of &quot;A Visit To Swansea&quot;, missing only the first two minutes prior to Hancock&#x27;s entrance.

====Series 3 (1955–1956)====
* 20 episodes, 19 October 1955 – 29 February 1956

Episodes 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 17 no longer exist. A short extract from episode 12 survives; this plus the only known copies of episodes 8 and 16 are lower-quality off-air recordings. &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot; was recovered in 2002 from off-air home recordings made by listener Vic Rogers, along with the original version of &quot;The New Secretary&quot; from series 4.

In April 2014 the BBC re-recorded &quot;The New Neighbour&quot;, &quot;The Breakfast Cereal&quot; and &quot;The Newspaper&quot;, selected by and recorded in the presence of Galton and Simpson, for the first series of &quot;The Missing Hancocks&quot;. The episodes were broadcast on Radio 4 in October and November 2014. On 21 July 2015 the BBC re-recorded &quot;The Red Planet&quot; and &quot;How Hancock Won The War&quot; (which, though not missing, is the poorest-quality surviving recording) for broadcast in November as part of the second series. &quot;A Visit To Russia&quot; and &quot;The Trial of Father Christmas&quot; were re-recorded in September 2015 for broadcast in December. On 3 September 2017 the BBC re-recorded &quot;The Winter Holiday&quot; for broadcast in the fourth series.

Episode 11 of the third series was supposed to be a new episode called &quot;The Counterfeiter&quot;, about Bill Kerr being forced to get a job, but the script went unused and a new version of &quot;Cinderella Hancock&quot; was recorded in its place. On 11 January 2019, the cast of &quot;The Missing Hancocks&quot; recorded the episode for the first time at the BBC Radio Theatre. It was broadcast on 1 January 2020. &quot;The New Year Resolutions&quot; was re-recorded on 13 January 2019 for broadcast on 31 December 2020.

Welcome to London was broadcast live on 3 August 1958 on the BBC Light Programme from the London Coliseum to commemorate the Cardiff British Empire and Commonwealth Games. It features a nine-minute sketch with Hancock, James and Kerr. A recording of the whole 90-minute programme was discovered in the collection of Bob Monkhouse after his death.

# The 13th of the Month (remake of &#x27;The 13th of the series&#x27;, 13th of 4th series) The script was re-written so that the plot did not hinge on it being the 13th of a series as broadcast.
# The New Secretary (remake of 5th of 4th series) Hattie Jacques&#x27;s arrival is presented in flashback, so the show can be placed anywhere in a series.
# The Ballet Visit (remake of &#x27;The Bolshoi Ballet&#x27; 2nd of 4th series) Ballet company changed to The Covent Garden Ballet, to avoid topical reference to 1956 visit to London by the Bolshoi Ballet.
# The Election Candidate (remake of 10th of 5th series) Hancock now stands for the local Independent party instead of the East Cheam Liberal party as he did in the original.

These episodes are remakes for overseas sales, rewritten to remove any topical or UK-specific references.

All episodes still exist, for many years the TS version of &quot;The New Secretary&quot; was the only version known to exist until an off-air audio recording of the original version was found in 2002.

==Television series==

The television version began in 1956 under the same name and with the same writers, produced for the BBC by Duncan Wood. The television and radio versions alternated until 1959, when the final radio series and the fifth television series were both broadcast during the autumn season. Only Sid James transferred from the radio series, although Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jacques each made a couple of appearances. The television version drew on a stock company of actors, who played different supporting characters in each episode. Semi-regulars included Liz Fraser, John Le Mesurier, Hugh Lloyd, Arthur Mullard and John Vyvyan.

The final television series, broadcast in 1961, was retitled &quot;Hancock&quot;, as it was shortened from a half-hour to 25 minutes. For this final series Sid James was no longer in the cast, as Hancock had become frustrated with the format. Some of the most celebrated episodes of the TV series were produced in this final series, including &quot;The Blood Donor&quot;, &quot;The Radio Ham&quot;, &quot;The Bedsitter&quot; and &quot;The Bowmans&quot;. Hancock&#x27;s character was relocated to a bedsitter in Earl&#x27;s Court for this series.

Some episodes of the radio series and telerecordings of some episodes from the third and fourth television series were destroyed. No episodes are known to survive from the first series of the TV show. The surviving radio episodes, which often exist only in edited versions that have been cut for overseas sale to commercial radio stations, were released as CD box sets between 2000 and 2003 (see below).

In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; was placed 24th. In 1962, the show became the first imported programme to win a Jacob&#x27;s Award following its transmission on Telefís Éireann, the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s national TV station.

In 1956 and 1957 Hancock had starred in two series of a sketch show made by Associated-Rediffusion for ITV television, which were broadcast either side of his first television series on the BBC.

In 1972 a Norwegian TV show called &quot;Fleksnes Fataliteter&quot; aired for the first time. It was based on scripts from &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. The show became trilingual, as it usually starred both Swedish and Norwegian actors, and was broadcast in Sweden and Norway as well as Denmark.

In 2016, &quot;The New Neighbour&quot; was restaged as part of the BBC&#x27;s Landmark Sitcom Season commemorating the 60th anniversary of the television sitcom.

==Commercial releases==

Four episodes of the TV series were re-recorded before studio audiences, in the style of radio programmes, and released on LP format, two by Pye on the 1961 album &quot;Hancock&quot; (&quot;The Blood Donor&quot; and &quot;The Radio Ham&quot;) and two by Decca on the 1965 album &quot;It&#x27;s Hancock&quot; (&quot;The Missing Page&quot; and &quot;The Reunion Party&quot;), which was reissued as &quot;The World of Tony Hancock&quot; in 1975. The re-recordings entailed the rewriting of a number of visual gags; for instance, at the end of the TV version of &quot;The Radio Ham&quot;, Hancock smashes his radio equipment, whereas in the LP version he holds an on-air auction for it. These recordings have been reissued several times on LP, cassette and CD, and have also appeared on comedy compilation CDs.

BBC Records released an LP titled &quot;Hancock&quot; featuring the original TV soundtracks of two episodes, &quot;The Lift&quot; and &quot;Twelve Angry Men.&quot; The episode &quot;The Lift&quot; was taken from the separate magnetic soundtrack of the telerecording, with the opening non-dialogue sequence omitted and one extra line of dialogue added: &quot;Watch that door button... Oh my God!&quot; as recorded by Hugh Lloyd on 24/08/76 and edited in. &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; was from the optical soundtrack of the telerecording, with theme and incidental music omitted, a few lines of dialogue edited out and pauses shortened.

The LP credits the theme music to Angela Morley, even though the music was omitted, and the episodes were recorded when she was still called Wally Stott.

There have been six LPs released of substantially complete radio episodes. The first was by Pye Records in 1960 entitled &quot;This is Hancock&quot; containing &quot;The Wild Man of The Woods&quot; and &quot;Sunday Afternoon At Home.&quot; The other five were by BBC Records, released as &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;: &quot;The Poetry Society&quot; and &quot;Sid&#x27;s Mystery Tours&quot;, released in 1980; &quot;The Americans Hit Town&quot; and &quot;The Unexploded Bomb&quot; in 1981; &quot;The Scandal Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Last of the McHancocks&quot; in 1982; &quot;The Sleepless Night&quot; and &quot;Fred&#x27;s Pie Stall&quot; in 1983; and finally &quot;Hancocks War&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Club&quot; in 1984. These five LPs were also released on audio cassette at the same time. Also, a number of comedy-themed LPs, EPs and 7-inch singles have been released over the years which have featured short extracts from various radio episodes.

The radio series of &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; was first released on cassette by the BBC as part of their Radio Collection series of audio cassettes in the late 1980s. The first three volumes were re-issues of the five LPs from the 1980s plus the LP of television soundtracks from 1976. Because only 10 volumes were made with four episodes each, and because a number of episodes were later returned from homemade off-air recordings by listeners, a release of the radio series was never completed on cassette. In 2000, the episodes still remaining from Series 1 of the radio series were released as a box set on CD. Series 2–6 followed throughout the next three years. The series has also been given three compilation CDs.

The television series of &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; was first released on VHS/Betamax in 1985 under BBC Enterprises (now Worldwide) in an incomplete form. A Laserdisc of Volume One was also issued under catalogue number BBCL 7004. Six videos were released, each containing three episodes and were mainly drawn from the last three series. The next video release was not to be for another nine years, and that was &quot;The Very Best of Hancock,&quot; a compilation including all episodes from the final series but excluding the last, &quot;The Succession: Son and Heir.&quot; In 1996, a video was released containing the first three remaining episodes. Two later videos were released in 1997, and another featuring &quot;The Train Journey&quot; was released in 1999. In 1992 &quot;Hancock: The Australian TV Series in Colour&quot; was released, compiled from the three episodes of the 1968 Australian series completed before Hancock&#x27;s death. This was released on VHS in both the UK and Australia.

The first DVD to be released was in 2001, which was a re-release of &quot;The Very Best of Hancock&quot; video. The next DVD was to be released in 2004, containing the first five episodes and the rarely seen &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Forty-Three Minutes.&quot; However, 2 Entertain released a box set in 2007 called &quot;The Tony Hancock Collection&quot;, containing every existing episode and new bonus features, including Hancock&#x27;s interview in &quot;Face to Face&quot; from 1960.

In June and August 2009, six off-air audio recordings of lost TV episodes from Series 4 were unearthed, though they had been knocking around the bootleg market for some time; however, two of them are very poor quality. The six episodes were: &quot;Underpaid or Grandad&#x27;s S.O.S.&quot;, &quot;The Flight of the Red Shadow&quot;, &quot;The Horror Serial&quot;, &quot;Matrimony – Almost&quot;, &quot;The Beauty Contest&quot; and &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;.

In 2009, the surviving radio episodes were repeated weekly on the digital network BBC Radio 7, chronologically sequenced.

<text>Angela Morley (10 March 192414 January 2009) was an English composer and conductor who became familiar to BBC Radio listeners in the 1950s under the name of Wally Stott. Morley provided incidental music for &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. She attributed her entry into composing and arranging largely to the influence and encouragement of the Canadian light music composer Robert Farnon. Morley transitioned in 1972 and thereafter lived openly as a transgender woman. Later in life, she lived in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Morley won three Emmy Awards for her work in music arrangement. These were in the category of Outstanding Music Direction, in 1985, 1988 and 1990, for &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot; and two television specials starring Julie Andrews. Morley also received eight Emmy nominations for composing music for television series such as &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;. She was twice nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Original Song Score: first for &quot;The Little Prince&quot; (1974), a nomination shared with Alan Jay Lerner, Frederick Loewe, and Douglas Gamley; and second for &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; (1976), which Morley shared with Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. She was the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an Academy Award.

==Early life and education==

Morley was born in Leeds, Yorkshire on 10 March 1924 under the name of Walter &quot;Wally&quot; Stott. Morley&#x27;s father was a watchmaker who played the ukulele-banjo, and the family lived above their jewellery shop. Her mother also sang. Morley was a fan of dance music before being able to read the labels on the records, listening notably to Jack Payne and Henry Hall as a child, and began learning the piano at the age of eight on a Challen upright piano. Morley&#x27;s father died of angina in 1933 at the age of 39, after which the family moved to Swinton and she ceased piano lessons. She then tried playing violin at age 10 and the accordion at age 11, including in competitions, before choosing the clarinet and alto saxophone as primary instruments, taking clarinet lessons and playing in the school orchestra. Morley then played in the semi-professional band led by Bert Clegg in Mexborough.

As a mostly self-taught musician able to sight-read, Morley left school at age 15 to tour with Archie&#x27;s Juvenile Band, earning a weekly wage of 10 shillings, and also worked as a projectionist. Her mentor at this time was the pianist Eddie Taylor. Morley continued to play saxophone in British dance bands during the period of World War II, joining the Oscar Rabin Band as lead alto in 1941, at age 17. With this band, she began writing arrangements for pay and made a recording debut with the tracks &quot;Waiting for Sally&quot; and &quot;Love in Bloom&quot;. She later joined Geraldo&#x27;s band, which performed for BBC Radio several times a week, in 1942 or 1944. With Geraldo&#x27;s band Morley gained experience arranging for bands of many sizes and styles. She studied harmony and musical composition in London with the British-Hungarian composer Mátyás Seiber and conducting with the German conductor Walter Goehr. Morley&#x27;s early work was also influenced by Robert Farnon and Bill Finegan.

==Career==
===Pre-transition work===
At the age of 26, Morley stopped playing in bands to instead work solely as a writer, composer, and arranger, and would go on to work in recording, radio, television, and film. She was originally a composer of light music or easy listening, best known for pieces such as the jaunty &quot;Rotten Row&quot; and &quot;A Canadian in Mayfair&quot;, the latter dedicated to Robert Farnon. She also worked with the Chappell Recorded Music Library and Reader&#x27;s Digest.

Morley is known for writing the theme tune, with its iconic tuba partition, and incidental music for &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; in both its radio and television incarnations, and was also the musical director for &quot;The Goon Show&quot; from the third series in 1952 to the last show in 1960, conducting the BBC Dance Orchestra. At this time, she was known to work quickly and would sometimes write music for &quot;The Goon Show&quot; the same day of recording, which consisted of two full-band arrangements per week and incidental music. Another short but remembered theme composed by Morley was the 12-note-long &quot;Ident Zoom-2&quot;, written for Lew Grade&#x27;s Associated TeleVision (ATV), in use from the introduction of colour television in 1969, until the demise of ATV in 1981. By 1953, Morley was also scoring films for the Associated British Picture Corporation under music director Louis Levy.

In 1953, Morley became musical director for the British section of Philips Records, arranging for and accompanying the company&#x27;s artists alongside producer Johnny Franz. She notably worked with Frankie Vaughan on &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; in 1957. In 1958, she began an association with Welsh singer Shirley Bassey, including work for Bassey&#x27;s recordings of &quot;The Banana Boat Song&quot; (1957), &quot;As I Love You&quot; (1958), which reached no. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1959, and &quot;Kiss Me Honey Kiss Me&quot; (1958). She was the head of an orchestra and a chorale at this time, releasing records as &quot;Wally Stott and His Orchestra&quot; and &quot;The Wally Stott Chorale&quot; respectively. She also worked with artists such as Noël Coward and Dusty Springfield and on the first four solo albums by Scott Walker. The next hits she worked on were Robert Earl&#x27;s &quot;I May Never Pass this Way Again&quot; and Frankie Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;Tower of Strength&quot;.
In 1962 and 1963, Morley arranged the United Kingdom entries for the Eurovision Song Contest, &quot;Ring-A-Ding Girl&quot; and &quot;Say Wonderful Things&quot;, both sung by Ronnie Carroll. The former was conducted on the Eurovision stage in Luxembourg. She was also credited with a rhythmic drum solo in the 1960 horror film &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, which a dancer plays on a tape recorder.

In 1961, Morley provided the orchestral accompaniments for a selection of choral arrangements made by Norman Luboff for an RCA album that was recorded in London&#x27;s Walthamstow Town Hall. The New Symphony Orchestra (an ad hoc recording ensemble, not to be confused with the earlier New Symphony Orchestra (London) or the Bulgarian New Symphony Orchestra (Sofia)), was conducted by Leopold Stokowski, and the professional British choir, namely the Ambrosian Singers as rehearsed by Luboff, performed such favourites as &quot;Deep River&quot;, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Largo&quot;, Bach&#x27;s &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot;, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Vocalise&quot;, under the album&#x27;s title &quot;Inspiration&quot; (also later reissued on a BMG Classics CD). In 1962, she arranged and conducted the RCA Red Seal debut album &quot;Romantic Italian Songs&quot; for Italian-born tenor Sergio Franchi, and later did the arrangements and conducting for Franchi&#x27;s 1963 RCA album, &quot;Women in My Life.&quot;

Some of her other notable works in the years before transitioning include the composition and arrangement for the films &quot;The Looking Glass War&quot;, released in 1970, and &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot;, released in 1971. She stepped back from the music and film industry between 1970 and 1972 in order privately to undergo gender transition. During this time, Morley studied clarinet chamber music at the Watford School of Music for eighteen months.

After transitioning to living publicly as a woman in 1972, Morley continued to work in music, now using the name Angela Morley professionally. Due to worries about how she would be received publicly as a transgender woman, she declined opportunities to appear on television, such as on &quot;The Last Goon Show of All&quot; in 1972, though she continued to work with many of her previous colleagues. Because of the scrutiny she might face, she had to be persuaded by Franz to continue conducting. One of her first projects upon her return to public life was as an orchestrator on &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. She then orchestrated, arranged, and aided in the composition of the music for the final musical film collaboration of Lerner and Loewe, &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, released in 1974. Her contribution to the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Music, Scoring Original Song Score and/or Adaptation and she travelled to California for the award ceremony.

Morley was also the composer, conductor, arranger and orchestrator for the Sherman Brothers&#x27; musical film adaptation of the Cinderella story, &quot;The Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella&quot; in 1976, however she was only credited as conductor and arranger. She was again nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Music, Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Best Adaptation Score for this film along with the Sherman Brothers and again was present at the award ceremony. Though initially reluctant, citing lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with the novel, Morley wrote most of the score for the animated &quot;Watership Down&quot; film, released in 1978. She had to work quickly based on work drafted by Malcolm Williamson, then Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music, who left the project. At this time, she was a regular guest conductor of the BBC Radio Orchestra and BBC Big Band.

=== Work in the United States ===
Following the success of &quot;Watership Down&quot;, Morley lived for a time in Brentwood, Los Angeles, where she began working for Warner Bros. She permanently relocated to Los Angeles in 1979 and began working primarily on American television soundtracks, including those of &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, working with the music departments of major production companies, including Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox Television.

Thanks to a mutual friend, Herbert W. Spencer, Morley collaborated with John Williams throughout the 1970s and 1980s, arranging for the Boston Pops Orchestra under Williams&#x27; direction and working on films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Hook&quot;, &quot;Home Alone&quot;, &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, though in an uncredited capacity. She also collaborated with André Previn, Lionel Newman, Miklós Rózsa, and Richard Rodney Bennett. Later, she would work with soloists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman. She was nominated six times for Emmy Awards for composing and won three times for music direction, notably of two Julie Andrews television specials.

Morley continued to work in television until 1990. She relocated again to Scottsdale, Arizona in 1994, where she recorded two CDs with the John Wilson Orchestra. She also lectured at the University of Southern California on film scoring and founded the Chorale of the Alliance française of Greater Phoenix. Her last film credit was for the Disney film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot; in 2002, where she worked as an additional orchestrator and composer of additional music.

== Personal life ==
Morley was a transgender woman and began transitioning to live openly as a woman in 1970, at the age of 46. According to her friend and colleague Max Geldray, she struggled with her gender identity throughout her life, and according to her wife, Christine Parker, Morley probably tried hormone replacement therapy at some point before they met. Morley underwent sex reassignment surgery in Casablanca in June 1970 and publicly came out as a woman in 1972. Morley was her original middle name; her birth was registered as Walter Morley Stott, Morley being her grandmother&#x27;s maiden name.

Morley was twice married. Her first wife, Beryl Stott, was a singer and choral arranger who founded the Beryl Stott Singers, also known as the Beryl Stott Chorus or Beryl Stott Group. Beryl Stott died prior to Morley&#x27;s gender transition. Morley met Christine Parker, also a singer, in London, and they married on 1 June 1970. Parker was a major support to Morley through her transition. Morley stated that: &quot;It was only because of her love and support that I then was able to deal with the trauma, and begin to think about crossing over that terrifying gender border.&quot;

The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1979 following the success of &quot;Watership Down&quot;, and owned a house in the San Fernando Valley. They moved to Scottsdale, Arizona in 1994. , Parker was still living in Scottsdale.

Morley had two children with her first wife Beryl Stott: a daughter, Helen, who predeceased her in 1986, and a son, Brian, who was living . She also had grandchildren and great-grandchildren at the time of her death.

Morley had many friendships with fellow musicians and industry colleagues. While working on &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, she made the acquaintance of Peter Sellers, and would eventually share fond memories of him to his biographer Ed Sikov. She and Max Geldray continued to be good friends following her transition. She also noted that she was lifelong friends with Herbert W. Spencer from 1955, while working on &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot;, until his death in 1992.

===Death===
Morley died in Scottsdale, Arizona on 14 January 2009 at the age of 84. Her death was a result of complications of a fall and a heart attack. Her death was almost exactly 50 years since her no. 1 hit with Shirley Bassey, &quot;As I Love You&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Morley&#x27;s talent was noted by many of her peers. Arranger Tony Osborne said that she was &quot;at the top of the range [...] second only to Robert Farnon, and it was a pretty close run thing at that&quot;, while Scott Walker compared working with Morley to working with Frederick Delius.

Morley was interviewed for the biography of her &quot;Goon Show&quot; colleague Peter Sellers by his biographer Ed Sikov prior to the book&#x27;s publication in 2002. When asked by Sikov how she should be identified in the book, she told him: &quot;It&#x27;s a judgement you&#x27;ll have to make and I&#x27;ll have to accept&quot;. Sikov chose to refer to her as Wally Stott in the context of her past work but as Angela Morley in the present; most posthumous writing about her follows a similar pattern.

In 2015, BBC Radio 4 produced a radio drama about Morley, &quot;1977&quot;, which was written by Sarah Wooley. &quot;1977&quot; is a semi-fictional account of the year in which Morley was enlisted to complete composition of the musical soundtrack to the film &quot;Watership Down&quot; in three weeks, after Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music Malcolm Williamson left the project. The radio drama, starring Rebecca Root, was rebroadcast in 2018.

Morley&#x27;s work has been compared to that of Wendy Carlos, given that they were both transgender women composing film scores in the same time period, though they never met; notably, the composer and researcher Jack Curtis Dubowsky analysed and compared their careers and styles in a chapter of his book &quot;Intersecting Film, Music, and Queerness&quot;. As a prominent and early transgender woman working in film, Morley has also been compared to trans women in the film industry who came out in later years, such as Lana Wachowski. In this vein, the film scholar Laura Horak promotes a broader view of the term &quot;filmmaker&quot; when it comes to transgender and gender variant individuals in film history, noting that:

Horak includes Morley among her selected list of trans and gender variant filmmakers as a composer, noting in particular her work on &quot;The Little Prince&quot; and &quot;Watership Down&quot; alongside the film works of other transgender and gender variant people in Classical Hollywood cinema such as Dorothy Arzner and Christine Jorgensen.

Morley is commemorated by a placed by Leeds Pride at the entrance to the BBC Leeds building, and also by a blue plaque at her birthplace in Kirkstall. She was nominated to feature as one of 383 women from Leeds on &quot;Ribbons&quot; - a sculpture celebrating women from the city, which was unveiled in October 2024.

=== Genre ===
Morley&#x27;s work was influenced by a number of genres and styles. She initially played in British dance bands, and spent much of her career composing music that was labelled as light and easy listening, as well as film scores and television soundtracks. Light music and easy listening were generally not taken seriously or given much respect at the time that Morley was composing, which Dubowsky credits partially to misogyny, due to the genre&#x27;s association with femininity. Dubowsky acknowledges that the genre has been seen as derivative, bourgeois, and (in America) racially exclusionary, but calls for the genre and Morley&#x27;s work to be reconsidered for its influence on film music and the technical skill required in its production. He also, in the conclusion to his chapter on Morley and Wendy Carlos, questions whether Morley was drawn to light music for its perceived feminine qualities.

Beyond her light and easy listening work, Morley collaborated with many kinds of artists at Philips Records, from folk music to rock and roll, produced her own recordings of music from Christmas music to show tunes, and later focused her attention on orchestral, classical and choral arrangements that went beyond the scope of light music and easy listening.

Morley credited her eventual turn away from film scores to technological changes: tape recording, new types of microphones, and the advent of stereophonic sound had reached the wider music industry, but not film. She wrote that &quot;to go to a cinema to hear one&#x27;s latest score was absolute torture.&quot; Nevertheless, she continued to work intermittently in film until 2002.

=== Characteristics of her compositions ===
Her music for &quot;The Goon Show&quot; stood out as having &quot;a jazz flavour, rather than the standard comedy-show music of that time.&quot; From some of her earliest composition works, Morley used instruments to represent characters, such as the tuba notes in the theme to &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; which represented Tony Hancock. While Morley was working with Johnny Franz at Philips Records, Robert Earl noted that Morley and Franz &quot;didn&#x27;t believe in fade-out endings so all those ballads end on big notes&quot;.

Her work on film scores is noted for her &quot;mastery of orchestration and gift for evoking moods and atmospheres&quot; (in reference to &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; and &quot;Watership Down&quot;) and &quot;her strengths in swing, classical, and romantic period styles&quot; (in reference to &quot;Watership Down&quot;). For &quot;Watership Down&quot;, Morley created a character theme for Kehaar, voiced by Zero Mostel. On &quot;Kehaar&#x27;s Theme&quot;, Dubowsky notes the influence of Claude Debussy and comments that:

He also notes that &quot;Kehaar&#x27;s Theme&quot; incorporates polyrhythms and has an emphasis on string instruments, and that it draws from many of the genres Morley worked in: &quot;classical, swing, jazz, light music, concert music, and film scoring&quot;. Speaking more broadly about the &quot;Watership Down&quot; score, Dubowsky also notes the effectiveness of &quot;Violet&#x27;s Gone&quot; and &quot;Venturing Forth&quot;.

<doc id="238190" wikidata="Q212320" url="?curid=238190" title="Circle of fifths">
<text>In music theory, the circle of fifths (sometimes also cycle of fifths) is a way of organizing pitches as a sequence of perfect fifths. Starting on a C, and using the standard system of tuning for Western music (12-tone equal temperament), the sequence is: C, G, D, A, E, B, F/G, C/D, G/A, D/E, A/B, F, and C. This order places the most closely related key signatures adjacent to one another.

Twelve-tone equal temperament tuning divides each octave into twelve equivalent semitones, and the circle of fifths leads to a C seven octaves above the starting point. If the fifths are tuned with an exact frequency ratio of 3:2 (the system of tuning known as just intonation), this is not the case (the circle does not &quot;close&quot;).

== Definition ==
The circle of fifths organizes pitches in a sequence of perfect fifths, generally shown as a circle with the pitches (and their corresponding keys) in clockwise order. It can be viewed in a counterclockwise direction as a circle of fourths. Harmonic progressions in Western music commonly use adjacent keys in this system, making it a useful reference for musical composition and harmony.

The top of the circle shows the key of C Major, with no sharps or flats. Proceeding clockwise, the pitches ascend by fifths. The key signatures associated with those pitches change accordingly: the key of G has one sharp, the key of D has 2 sharps, and so on. Proceeding counterclockwise from the top of the circle, the notes change by descending fifths and the key signatures change accordingly: the key of F has one flat, the key of B has 2 flats, and so on. Some keys (at the bottom of the circle) can be notated either in sharps or in flats.

Starting at any pitch and ascending by a fifth generates all tones before returning to the beginning pitch class (a pitch class consists of all of the notes indicated by a given letter regardless of octave—all &quot;C&quot;s, for example, belong to the same pitch class). Moving counterclockwise, the pitches descend by a fifth, but ascending by a perfect fourth will lead to the same note an octave higher (therefore in the same pitch class). Moving counter-clockwise from C could be thought of as descending by a fifth to F, or ascending by a fourth to F.



==Structure and use==
===Diatonic key signatures===
Each pitch can serve as the tonic of a major or minor key, and each of these keys will have a diatonic scale associated with it. The circle diagram shows the number of sharps or flats in each key signature, with the major key indicated by a capital letter and the minor key indicated by a lower-case letter. Major and minor keys that have the same key signature are referred to as &quot;relative major&quot; and &quot;relative minor&quot; of one another.

===Modulation and chord progression===
Tonal music often modulates to a new tonal center whose key signature differs from the original by only one flat or sharp. These closely-related keys are a fifth apart from each other and are therefore adjacent in the circle of fifths. Chord progressions also often move between chords whose roots are related by perfect fifth, making the circle of fifths useful in illustrating the &quot;harmonic distance&quot; between chords.
The circle of fifths is used to organize and describe the harmonic or tonal function of chords. Chords can progress in a pattern of ascending perfect fourths (alternately viewed as descending perfect fifths) in &quot;functional succession&quot;. This can be shown &quot;...by the circle of fifths (in which, therefore, scale degree II is closer to the dominant than scale degree IV)&quot;. In this view the tonic or tonal center is considered the end point of a chord progression derived from the circle of fifths.
According to Richard Franko Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Harmony in Western Music&quot;, &quot;the IV chord is, in the simplest mechanisms of diatonic relationships, at the greatest distance from I. In terms of the [descending] circle of fifths, it leads away from I, rather than toward it.&quot; He states that the progression I–ii–V–I (an authentic cadence) would feel more final or resolved than I–IV–I (a plagal cadence). Goldman concurs with Nattiez, who argues that &quot;the chord on the fourth degree appears long before the chord on II, and the subsequent final I, in the progression I–IV–viio–iii–vi–ii–V–I&quot;, and is farther from the tonic there as well. (In this and related articles, upper-case Roman numerals indicate major triads while lower-case Roman numerals indicate minor triads.)

===Circle closure in non-equal tuning systems===
Using the exact 3:2 ratio of frequencies to define a perfect fifth (just intonation) does not quite result in a return to the pitch class of the starting note after going around the circle of fifths. Twelve-tone equal temperament tuning produces fifths that return to a tone exactly seven octaves above the initial tone and makes the frequency ratio of the chromatic semitone the same as that of the diatonic semitone. The standard tempered fifth has a frequency ratio of 27/12:1 (or about 1.498307077:1), approximately two cents narrower than a justly tuned fifth.

Ascending by twelve justly tuned fifths fails to close the circle by an excess of approximately 23.46 cents, roughly a quarter of a semitone, an interval known as the Pythagorean comma. If limited to twelve pitches per octave, Pythagorean tuning markedly shortens the width of one of the twelve fifths, which makes it severely dissonant. This anomalous fifth is called the wolf fifth – a humorous reference to a wolf howling an off-pitch note. Non-extended quarter-comma meantone uses eleven fifths slightly narrower than the equally tempered fifth, and requires a much wider and even more dissonant wolf fifth to close the circle. More complex tuning systems based on just intonation, such as 5-limit tuning, use at most eight justly tuned fifths and at least three non-just fifths (some slightly narrower, and some slightly wider than the just fifth) to close the circle.

===Equal-tempered tunings with more than twelve notes===
Nowadays, with the advent of electronic isomorphic keyboards, equal temperament tunings with more than twelve notes per octave can be used to close the circle of fifths for other tunings. For example, 31-tone equal temperament closely approximates quarter-comma meantone, and 53-tone equal temperament closely approximates Pythagorean tuning.

==History==

The circle of fifths developed in the late 1600s and early 1700s to theorize the modulation of the Baroque era (see ).

The first circle of fifths diagram appears in the &quot;Grammatika&quot; (1677) of the composer and theorist Nikolay Diletsky, who intended to present music theory as a tool for composition. It was &quot;the first of its kind, aimed at teaching a Russian audience how to write Western-style polyphonic compositions.&quot; 

A circle of fifths diagram was independently created by German composer and theorist Johann David Heinichen in his &quot;Neu erfundene und gründliche Anweisung&quot; (1711), which he called the &quot;Musical Circle&quot; (German: &quot;Musicalischer Circul&quot;). This was also published in his &quot;Der General-Bass in der Composition&quot; (1728).

Heinichen placed the relative minor key next to the major key, which did not reflect the actual proximity of keys. Johann Mattheson (1735) and others attempted to improve this—David Kellner (1737) proposed having the major keys on one circle, and the relative minor keys on a second, inner circle. This was later developed into chordal space, incorporating the parallel minor as well.

Some sources imply that the circle of fifths was known in antiquity, by Pythagoras. This is a misunderstanding and an anachronism. Tuning by fifths (so-called Pythagorean tuning) dates to Ancient Mesopotamia; see , though they did not extend this to a twelve note scale, stopping at seven. The Pythagorean comma was calculated by Euclid and by Chinese mathematicians (in the &quot;Huainanzi&quot;); see . Thus, it was known in antiquity that a cycle of twelve fifths was almost exactly seven octaves (more practically, alternating ascending fifths and descending fourths was almost exactly an octave). However, this was theoretical knowledge, and was not used to construct a repeating twelve-tone scale, nor to modulate. This was done later in meantone temperament and twelve-tone equal temperament, which allowed modulation while still being in tune, but did not develop in Europe until about 1500. Although popularized as the circle of fifths, its Anglo-Saxon etymological origins trace back to the name &quot;wheel of fifths.&quot;

==Use==
In musical pieces from the Baroque music era and the Classical era of music and in Western popular music, traditional music and folk music, when pieces or songs modulate to a new key, these modulations are often associated with the circle of fifths.

In practice, compositions rarely make use of the entire circle of fifths. More commonly, composers make use of &quot;the compositional idea of the &#x27;cycle&#x27; of 5ths, when music moves consistently through a smaller or larger segment of the tonal structural resources which the circle abstractly represents.&quot; The usual practice is to derive the circle of fifths progression from the seven tones of the diatonic scale, rather from the full range of twelve tones present in the chromatic scale. In this diatonic version of the circle, one of the fifths is not a true fifth: it is a tritone (or a diminished fifth), e.g. between F and B in the &quot;natural&quot; diatonic scale (i.e. without sharps or flats). Here is how the circle of fifths derives, through permutation from the diatonic major scale:

And from the (natural) minor scale:

The following is the basic sequence of chords that can be built over the major bass-line:

And over the minor: 
Adding sevenths to the chords creates a greater sense of forward momentum to the harmony:
===Baroque era===
According to Richard Taruskin, Arcangelo Corelli was the most influential composer to establish the pattern as a standard harmonic &quot;trope&quot;: &quot;It was precisely in Corelli&#x27;s time, the late seventeenth century, that the circle of fifths was being &#x27;theorized&#x27; as the main propellor of harmonic motion, and it was Corelli more than any one composer who put that new idea into telling practice.&quot;

The circle of fifths progression occurs frequently in the music of J. S. Bach. In the following, from &quot;Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen&quot;, BWV 51, even when the solo bass line implies rather than states the chords involved:

Baroque composers learnt to enhance the &quot;propulsive force&quot; of the harmony engendered by the circle of fifths &quot;by adding sevenths to most of the constituent chords.&quot; &quot;These sevenths, being dissonances, create the need for resolution, thus turning each progression of the circle into a simultaneous reliever and re-stimulator of harmonic tension... Hence harnessed for expressive purposes.&quot; Striking passages that illustrate the use of sevenths occur in the aria &quot;Pena tiranna&quot; in Handel&#x27;s 1715 opera &quot;Amadigi di Gaula&quot;:

In Wagner&#x27;s opera, &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, a cycle of fifths progression occurs in the music which transitions from the end of the prologue into the first scene of Act 1, set in the imposing hall of the wealthy Gibichungs. &quot;Status and reputation are written all over the motifs assigned to Gunther&quot;, chief of the Gibichung clan:

===Jazz and popular music===
The enduring popularity of the circle of fifths as both a form-building device and as an expressive musical trope is evident in the number of &quot;standard&quot; popular songs composed during the twentieth century. It is also favored as a vehicle for improvisation by jazz musicians, as the circle of fifths helps songwriters understand intervals, chord-relationships and progressions.

* Jerome Kern, &quot;All the Things You Are&quot;
* Ray Noble, &quot;Cherokee.&quot; Many jazz musicians have found this particularly challenging as the middle eight progresses so rapidly through the circle, &quot;creating a series of II–V–I progressions that temporarily pass through several tonalities.&quot;

===Diatonic circle of fifths===

The diatonic circle of fifths is the circle of fifths encompassing only members of the diatonic scale. Therefore, it contains a diminished fifth, in C major between B and F. See structure implies multiplicity.
The circle progression is commonly a circle of fifths through the diatonic chords, including one diminished chord. A circle progression in C major with chords I–IV–viio–iii–vi–ii–V–I is shown below.

===Chromatic circle===

The circle of fifths is closely related to the chromatic circle, which also arranges the equal-tempered pitch classes of a particular tuning in a circular ordering. A key difference between the two circles is that the chromatic circle can be understood as a continuous space where every point on the circle corresponds to a conceivable pitch class, and every conceivable pitch class corresponds to a point on the circle. By contrast, the circle of fifths is fundamentally a &quot;discrete&quot; structure arranged through distinct intervals, and there is no obvious way to assign pitch classes to each of its points. In this sense, the two circles are mathematically quite different.

However, for any positive integer &quot;N&quot;, the pitch classes in &quot;N&quot;-tone equal temperament can be represented by the cyclic group of order &quot;N&quot;, or equivalently, the residue classes modulo equal to &quot;N&quot;, formula_1. In twelve-tone equal temperament, the group formula_2 has four generators, which can be identified with the ascending and descending semitones and the ascending and descending perfect fifths. The semitonal generator gives rise to the chromatic circle while the perfect fourth and perfect fifth give rise to the circle of fifths. In most other tunings, such as in 31 equal temperament, many more intervals can be used as the generator, and many more circles are possible as a result.

===Relation with chromatic scale===

The circle of fifths, or fourths, may be mapped from the chromatic scale by multiplication, and vice versa. To map between the circle of fifths and the chromatic scale (in integer notation) multiply by 7 (M7), and for the circle of fourths multiply by 5 (P5).

In twelve-tone equal temperament, one can start off with an ordered 12-tuple (tone row) of integers:
: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)
representing the notes of the chromatic scale: 0 = C, 2 = D, 4 = E, 5 = F, 7 = G, 9 = A, 11 = B, 1 = C, 3 = D, 6 = F, 8 = G, 10 = A. Now multiply the entire 12-tuple by 7:
: (0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77)
and then apply a modulo 12 reduction to each of the numbers (subtract 12 from each number as many times as necessary until the number becomes smaller than 12):
: (0, 7, 2, 9, 4, 11, 6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5)
which is equivalent to
: (C, G, D, A, E, B, F, C, G, D, A, F)
which is the circle of fifths.
This is enharmonically equivalent to:
: (C, G, D, A, E, B, G, D, A, E, B, F).

===Enharmonic equivalents, theoretical keys, and the spiral of fifths===


Equal temperament tunings do not use the exact 3:2 ratio of frequencies that defines a perfect fifth, whereas just intonation uses this exact ratio. Ascending by fifths in equal temperament leads to a return to the starting pitch class—starting with a C and ascending by fifths leads to another C after a certain number of iterations. This does not occur if an exact 3:2 ratio is used (just intonation). The adjustment made in equal temperament tuning is called the Pythagorean comma. Because of this difference, pitches that are enharmonically equivalent in equal temperaments (such as C and D in 12-tone equal temperament, or C and D in 19 equal temperament) are not equivalent when using just intonation.

In just intonation the sequence of fifths can therefore be visualized as a spiral, not a circle—a sequence of twelve fifths results in a &quot;comma pump&quot; by the Pythagorean comma, visualized as going up a level in the spiral. See also .

Without enharmonic equivalences, continuing a sequence of fifths results in notes with double accidentals (double sharps or double flats), or even triple or quadruple accidentals. In most equal temperament tunings, these can be replaced by enharmonically equivalent notes.

Keys with double or triple sharps and flats in key signatures are called theoretical keys; they are redundant in 12-tone equal temperament, and so their use is extremely rare, but if the number of notes per octave is not a multiple of 12, they are distinguished. Notation in these cases is not standardized.

The default behaviour of LilyPond (pictured above) writes single sharps or flats in the circle-of-fifths order, before proceeding to double sharps or flats. This is the format used in John Foulds&#x27; &quot;A World Requiem&quot;, Op. 60, which ends with the key signature of G major, as displayed above. The sharps in the key signature of G major here proceed C, G, D, A, E, B, F.

Single sharps or flats in the key signature are sometimes repeated as a courtesy, e.g. Max Reger&#x27;s &quot;Supplement to the Theory of Modulation&quot;, which contains D minor key signatures on pp. 42–45. These have a B at the start and also a B at the end (with a double-flat symbol), going B, E, A, D, G, C, F, B. The convention of LilyPond and Foulds would suppress the initial B.
Sometimes the double signs are written at the beginning of the key signature, followed by the single signs. For example, the F key signature is notated as B, E, A, D, G, C, F. This convention is used by Victor Ewald, by the program Finale, and by some theoretical works.

<text>U.S. Route 27 or U.S. Highway 27 (US 27) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. The southern terminus is at US 1 in Miami, Florida. The northern terminus is at Interstate 69 (I-69) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. From Miami, it goes up the center of Florida, then west to Tallahassee, Florida, and north through such cities and towns as Columbus, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Lexington, Kentucky; Cincinnati, Ohio; Oxford, Ohio; Richmond, Indiana; and Fort Wayne, Indiana. It once extended north through Lansing, Michigan, to Cheboygan, Mackinaw City, and, for about three years, even as far as St. Ignace. US 27 was first signed in 1926, replacing what had been the eastern route of the Dixie Highway in many states.

===Florida===

In Florida, US 27 has been designated the Claude Pepper Memorial Highway by the Florida Legislature. It was named after long-time Florida U.S. Senator and Representative Claude Pepper. The stretch running from Miami to South Bay was originally designated the Thomas E. Will Memorial Highway by the Florida Legislature in 1937 when that portion was known as State Road 26 (SR 26). Will, the founder of Okeelanta, had been instrumental in getting the state to build the road from Miami to the area south of Lake Okeechobee. Nearly the entire length of US 27 in Florida is a divided highway.

US 27 begins as North 36th Street in Midtown Miami, heading west from US 1 for before turning northwest to pass under the western terminus of SR 112 (Airport Expressway). It then proceeds northwest for as South Okeechobee Road, parallel to the Miami Canal, forming the southwest boundary of the city of Hialeah. After an interchange with SR 826 (Palmetto Expressway), it continues northwest as North Okeechobee Road for before an interchange with the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (SR 821). After another , the highway curves to the north and, after passing the northern terminus of SR 997 (Krome Avenue), crosses into Broward County.

In Broward County, the highway passes protected wetlands and heavy-duty powerlines on the west and the outer reaches of the suburban communities of Pembroke Pines and Weston on the east. US 27 then reaches an interchange with I-75 and Alligator Alley before curving to the northwest toward South Bay and Lake Okeechobee.

The highway skirts the southwestern shore of Lake Okeechobee and then heads west at Clewiston, before making a sharp turn to the north toward Moore Haven. The road then proceeds in a northerly direction toward the central Florida communities of Lake Placid, Sebring, Avon Park, and Lake Wales.

Widening of US 27 to a six-lane highway continues in Polk County. The following sections have been completed and are open to six lanes of traffic:
* SR 60 to SR 540 in Lake Wales
* SR 542 in Dundee to north of I-4 in Davenport

North of I-4, US 27 contains unnumbered interchanges with US 192 and then County Road 474 (CR 474) in Four Corners, SR 50 in Clermont, and SR 19 south of Howey-in-the-Hills, which also includes a southbound interchange with Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. The northbound turnpike interchange can be found further northwest. US 441 later joins US 27 in Leesburg and US 301 in Belleview, only for the road to break away from both in Ocala.

US 27 resumes its status as its own route until it reaches Williston and joins US 41. This concurrency continues northward until US 41 reaches High Springs and joins US 441. US 27 heads west along the unsigned SR 20 toward Perry and joins US 19 until US 19 breaks away in Capps, but not before resuming a westward direction. In Tallahassee, the road becomes Apalachee Parkway, a major east–west thoroughfare. Constructed in 1957, the Apalachee Parkway starts at SR 61 (Monroe Street) in front of the Florida State Capitol building. It has a short expressway section just east of the capitol, then is a busy four-lane surface boulevard with service roads for the next few miles, passing the Governor&#x27;s Square mall and many state office buildings. Past Tallahassee, US 27 finally resumes its northwesterly direction. The highway goes through Havana before entering Amsterdam, Georgia.

===Georgia===

In Georgia, US 27 has been designated the Martha Berry Highway by the Georgia State Legislature. It was named after Martha Berry, founder of Berry College in Rome. US 27 is a designated Governor&#x27;s Road Improvement Program (GRIP) developmental highway corridor which will eventually be widened to four lanes (mostly divided) from the Florida state line to the Tennessee state line. All of US 27 in Georgia is concurrent with State Route 1.

===Tennessee===
In Chattanooga, a portion of US 27 was once signed as I-124. Though the designation still exists, it is no longer signed as such. In and around the Chattanooga area, US 27 is sometimes referred to as Corridor J, the designation of a road in the Appalachian Development Highway System between Chattanooga and London, Kentucky, intended to follow the route of US 27.

Throughout its approximately stretch between Chattanooga and Harriman, US 27 traverses a valley between the Tennessee River to the east and the Cumberland Plateau to the west. The plateau&#x27;s Walden Ridge escarpment is frequently visible to the west. From Chattanooga, the highway passes through Soddy-Daisy. Here, it intersects State Route 111 (SR 111), which veers northwestward across the Plateau into Middle Tennessee. US 27 continues through Sale Creek and Graysville before reaching Dayton. At Dayton, it intersects SR 30, which connects Dayton with Pikeville to the west and Decatur to the east, and SR 60, which connects Dayton with Cleveland to the southeast. US 27 continues northward through Evensville before arriving at Spring City. At Spring City, it intersects SR 68, which connects the area to Crossville, atop the plateau to the west.

From here, US 27 enters Roane County, running concurrently with US 70 going through the city of Rockwood. After US 70 splits to the east, US 27 runs concurrently with SR 61 through Harriman, where it is crossed by I-40. During this stretch, it forms part of the Harvey H. Hannah Memorial Highway and is signed as such. Just beyond Harriman, near the DeArmond community, US 27 ascends the Cumberland Plateau and continues northward across the plateau for its remaining or so in Tennessee.

In Morgan County, the highway passes through Wartburg and Sunbright. At Elgin, it intersects SR 52, which connects the area with the historic village of Rugby and Fentress County to the west. Beyond Elgin, US 27 passes through Robbins, Huntsville, and Helenwood before reaching Oneida in Scott County. In Oneida, US 27 intersects SR 297, which continues westward into the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area. A short time later, US 27 intersects with SR 456, which continues to SR 63. After coming to a stop, it then makes a sharp left turn to go through downtown Oneida. After a further , it then reaches Winfield. Winfield is the last sizable town that US 27 passes through in Tennessee before it reaches the community of Isham on the Kentucky border.

===Kentucky===
US 27 enters Kentucky near Whitley City. The first major town it goes through is Somerset, followed by Stanford, Lancaster, Nicholasville, and Lexington, where it begins a concurrency with US 68 that continues to Paris. US 27 continues north from there through Cynthiana, Falmouth, Alexandria, Cold Spring, Highland Heights, Fort Thomas, Southgate, and Newport before crossing into Ohio at Cincinnati via the Taylor–Southgate Bridge. From its junction with I-471 in Highland Heights through most of Campbell County, it is a four-lane highway, as it is with the US 68 concurrency and south from Lexington to Kentucky Route 34. It has four lanes from the northern boundary of Pulaski County to just south of the Cumberland River (Lake Cumberland) bridge at Burnside.

===Ohio===

US 27 crosses into Ohio and Downtown Cincinnati via the Taylor–Southgate Bridge. US 27 follows Mehring Way, Central Avenue, Ezzard Charles Drive, and Central Parkway through Downtown Cincinnati. US 27 briefly duplexes with I-75, exiting at I-74 for another brief duplex before exiting onto Colerain Avenue. US 27 then continues northwest eventually to Oxford and then reaches the Indiana border another northwest at College Corner.

Overall, US 27 is in Ohio for : in Hamilton County and another in Butler County.

===Indiana===
US 27 enters the southeastern part of Indiana south of the town of Liberty. At Liberty, US 27 turns north, paralleling the Ohio state line. It intersects I-70 at Richmond and continues north to Decatur. US 33 joins US 27 just south of Decatur and the two routes share a northwesterly alignment on a divided surface highway from Decatur to I-469 south of Fort Wayne. US 33 turns west and follows I-469, while US 27 continues north into downtown Fort Wayne as Clinton Street. North of downtown, US 27 follows Lima Road to its terminus at I-69/US 30 (Lima Road continues north from this point as State Road 3, or SR 3).

==History==
Originally, the southern terminus of US 27 was in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1928, the route was extended south to Chattanooga, Tennessee, then to Tallahassee, Florida, in 1934. In 1949, it was extended to its current terminus in Miami. At its northern end, US 27 originally terminated at Cheboygan, Michigan. In 1937, the route was extended concurrently with US 23 to Mackinaw City, where it ended at the Michigan State Auto Ferry Dock along with US 23 and US 31. After the completion of the Mackinac Bridge in 1957, US 27 was extended across the bridge to the current intersection of I-75 and US 2 near St. Ignace. In 1961, what became I-75 was completed, enabling the roadway to be designated as I-75. At the same time, US 27 was truncated to an interchange with I-75 south of Grayling. In 2002, the northern terminus was moved to its current location.

From Grayling to I-69 near Lansing, the road is now designated US 127. US 27 signs were removed from I-69 between Lansing and Fort Wayne in 2001. Officially, the current northern terminus is at the junction of I-69, US 30, and SR 3, but heading north on I-69 one will still see US 27 shields on some of the older overhead signs heading to the I-469 interchange on the northern edge of Fort Wayne.

===Indiana===
On March 9, 2007, legislation was introduced in the Indiana House of Representatives to designate US 27 as historic highway. Richmond, one of the cities US 27 passes through, would have two historic highways passing through it. The original National Road (US 40) runs through Richmond.

===Michigan===
US 27 was one of the highways in Michigan to carry the &quot;To I-75&quot; designation when I-75 was being constructed.

The at-grade routing of US 27 in Michigan has been largely superseded by I-75, which follows a roughly similar route and in some places actually replaced the older highway. From Lansing north to I-75, the former US 27 is now US 127; from Lansing south to Fort Wayne, US 27 was replaced by I-69. In many places the route markers and the highway itself serve to connect local communities bypassed by the Interstate Highway.

<text>WKAQ-TV (channel 2) is a television station in San Juan, Puerto Rico, serving as the U.S. territory&#x27;s dual Telemundo and NBC outlet. It is owned and operated by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal. WKAQ-TV&#x27;s studios are located on Franklin Roosevelt Avenue in San Juan near Hiram Bithorn Stadium, and its transmitter is located on Cerro la Santa in Cayey near the Carite State Forest.

[[WTIN-TV]] (channel 2.11) in Ponce and [[WNJX-TV]] (channel 2.12) in Mayagüez, branded on-air as Telemundo West, operate as full-time satellites of WKAQ-TV, which rebroadcast the station&#x27;s programming to the southern and western regions of Puerto Rico under an affiliation agreement with Hemisphere Media Group (owner of parent station WAPA-TV, channel 4). WKAQ-TV formerly operated WOLE-TV (channel 12) in Aguadilla and WORA-TV (channel 5) in Mayagüez as satellite stations. WKAQ-TV also has three low-power translator facilities: W09AT-D in Fajardo, W28EH-D in Adjuntas and W28EQ-D in Utuado. WKAQ-TV also simulcasts the signal of New York City sister station WNBC with the branding of NBC Puerto Rico.

==History==
WKAQ-TV, the first television station in Puerto Rico, was founded by Ángel Ramos on March 28, 1954. Ramos was also the owner of the newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; and Puerto Rico&#x27;s first licensed radio station, WKAQ (580 AM). Initially affiliated with CBS until 1967, WKAQ-TV battled fiercely with WAPA-TV to become the highest-rated station in Puerto Rico. During the 1970s and 1980s, WKAQ-TV was a major producer of Puerto Rican Spanish soap operas and was known for its &quot;fingers&quot; logo. Since its spin-off in 1987, the station has branded itself as &quot;Telemundo Puerto Rico&quot;, becoming one of Telemundo&#x27;s flagship stations. Despite criticism that the station traded locally produced programming for foreign Spanish programming, it aired the first Puerto Rican written and produced telenovela in 15 years in 2006. In 2005, WKAQ-TV became a superstation when NBC Universal reformatted Telemundo Internacional into Telemundo Puerto Rico. WKAQ-TV began airing its programming in high definition on April 23, 2009. The station entered into an agreement with Hemisphere Media Group to broadcast Telemundo Puerto Rico&#x27;s programming on WAPA-TV on June 28, 2019.

===Problems and possible Telemundo integration===
Since the beginning of the Telemundo network, WKAQ had been operated semi-independently from the network since its inception. This allowed the station to focus on local programming, with network programming used as filler. However, declining ratings and local cancellations have led to rumors that WKAQ may become a standard Telemundo station, dropping all local programming except for &quot;Telenoticias&quot;. WKAQ&#x27;s ratings declined significantly in the early 2000s due to the entrance of Univision into the Puerto Rican market. Since then, many local shows produced by WKAQ have been canceled, and the station has laid off staff. WKAQ now has very few non-news local programming remaining. Recently, the station has become the leading station on the island in terms of viewership against WLII and WAPA, with its telenovela block dominating in the 7 to 10 p.m. time period. Additionally, since January 2009, WKAQ has aired Lost on weeknights at 10 p.m. leading that time slot. has seen an increase in viewership in its 11 a.m. time slot, and a local teen drama has been successful in the teen market in Puerto Rico. WKAQ regained the rights to the local Miss Universe pageant and began airing a new gossip show called in January 2010. The program helped WKAQ compete with WAPA-TV&#x27;s gossip show but was canceled in March 2020 due to production issues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Return to local programming===
After years of struggling to compete with rival WAPA and the possibility of undergoing a full integration with the mainland feed of Telemundo, WKAQ-TV has managed to return to producing local programming. As of March 2021, WKAQ-TV produces hours of local programming on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays; while on Tuesdays, the station produces hours of local programming. Some of the current shows include , , and local newscasts which expanded to two hours in January 2020 and positioned itself as the leading newscast in Puerto Rico beating WAPA&#x27;s in the same timeslot.
==News operation==

WKAQ-TV has been producing local news shows under the brand name since 1954. The first edition of was created by Evelio Otero, who proposed the name to Ángel Ramos and was approved immediately. In the 1960s, a renewed edition of began with different anchors.

In 2003, the station launched a weekday morning newscast called with Charito Fraticelli, Silverio Pérez, Lourdes Collazo, Miguel Ramos, and panel experts.

In 2006, the station laid off 60 to 80 staffers, including some anchors and reporters, as part of the &quot;NBC Universal 2.0&quot; restructuring. As a result, the morning, midday, and weekend editions of were canceled. However, on January 8, 2007, debuted a new set, new graphics, and new music.

In 2011, NBCUniversal announced that it would relaunch the 11 a.m. and weekend evening editions of in early 2012, as a condition by the FCC to approve the sale of a controlling stake in the company to Philadelphia-based cable provider and telecommunications company Comcast, requiring NBCUniversal&#x27;s NBC and Telemundo owned-and-operated stations to increase the amount of locally produced programming. In 2014, WKAQ-TV brought back the weekend newscast, which premiered on May 31 under the name .
On January 31, 2023, WKAQ-TV announced that the station would be shortening the 5 p.m. edition of Telenoticias from one hour to a half-hour to accommodate their new show (&quot;First Question with Rafael Lenín Lopez&quot;). Hosted by Rafael Lenín Lopez, the show features political analysis, special interviews, and discussions of topics relevant to Puerto Ricans&#x27; daily lives. Special contributors to the show include PNP Senator Thomas Rivera Schatz, former Puerto Rican governor Alejandro García Padilla, Carlos Díaz Olivo, Luis Pabón Roca, and Anabelle Torres Colberg. Although produced by WKAQ&#x27;s news department, the new show is considered a separate program from and airs from 5:30 p.m. onwards. The show aims to bring fresh perspectives and insightful discussions to viewers, and it is expected to be a welcome addition to WKAQ&#x27;s news programming lineup.

In December 2020, WKAQ announced that it would be relaunching its morning news operation with the launching of a new morning program set to debut in February 2021. The morning show, named , would have a magazine-style format and air from 8 to 10 a.m. on weekdays. Ivonne Orsini and Ramón &quot;Gato&quot; Sylvia Gómez, who previously worked with rival station WAPA, were announced as the hosts on January 5, 2021, while former Senator Zoe Laboy joined the show for a political analysis segment. Grenda Rivera and Elizabeth Robaina were also announced to host a news segment and a weather/traffic segment, respectively.

The first broadcast of was on February 15, 2021, live from the Sandra Zaiter Studio at WKAQ-TV. It featured a special interview with Puerto Rican Governor Pedro Pierluisi and the introduction of special contributors Desiree Lowry and Suzette Baco. On February 3, 2023, Ramón &quot;Gato&quot; Gómez announced he would be leaving the show to cover the 2023 Baloncesto Superior Nacional basketball tournament as an analyst. Radio personality Jacky Fontánez was then announced as the show&#x27;s new co-host.

On January 8, 2024, two new talents joined the show as hosts. Carlos McConnie and Jasond Calderón (who is also a cast member on the station&#x27;s comedy show &quot;Raymond y sus Amigos&quot;) would now join Orsini, Fontánez and Noa as hosts of the show moving forward. The show also announced it would expand its run time later in the year adding a new hour of the show from 10 a.m. to 11 am.

<text>The grey heron (Ardea cinerea) is a long-legged wading bird of the heron family, Ardeidae, native throughout temperate Europe and Asia, and also parts of Africa. It is resident in much of its range, but some populations from the more northern parts migrate southwards in autumn. A bird of wetland areas, it can be seen around lakes, rivers, ponds, marshes and on the sea coast. It feeds mostly on aquatic creatures which it catches after standing stationary beside or in the water, or stalking its prey through the shallows.

Standing up to tall, adults weigh from . They have a white head and neck with a broad black stripe that extends from the eye to the black crest. The body and wings are grey above and the underparts are greyish-white, with some black on the flanks. The long, sharply pointed beak is pinkish-yellow and the legs are brown.

The birds breed colonially in spring in heronries, usually building their nests high in trees. A clutch of usually three to five bluish-green eggs is laid. Both birds incubate the eggs for around 25 days, and then both feed the chicks, which fledge when 7-8 weeks old. Many juveniles do not survive their first winter, but if they do, they can expect to live for about 5 years.

In Ancient Egypt, the deity Bennu was depicted as a heron in New Kingdom artwork. In Ancient Rome, the heron was a bird of divination. Roast heron was once a specially prized dish; when George Neville became Archbishop of York in 1465, 400 herons were served to the guests.

==Taxonomy==
Grey herons belong to the subfamily Ardeinae, along with the majority of extant species, which are known as the &quot;typical herons&quot;. The grey heron was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the cattle egret and the great egret in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea cinerea&quot;. The scientific name comes from the Latin &quot;ardea&quot; meaning &quot;heron&quot; and &quot;cinereus&quot; meaning &quot;ash-grey&quot; or &quot;ash-coloured&quot;.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. c. cinerea&quot; – : nominate, found in Europe, Africa, western Asia
* &quot;A. c. jouyi&quot; – : found in eastern Asia
* &quot;A. c. firasa&quot; – : found in Madagascar
* &quot;A. c. monicae&quot; – : found on islands off Banc d&#x27;Arguin, Mauritania.

It is closely related and similar to the North American great blue heron (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;), which differs in being larger, and having chestnut-brown flanks and thighs; and to the cocoi heron (&quot;Ardea cocoi&quot;) from South America, with which it forms a superspecies. Some authorities believe that the subspecies &quot;A. c. monicae&quot; should be considered a separate species. It has been known to hybridise with the great egret (&quot;Ardea alba&quot;), the little egret (&quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;), the great blue heron and the purple heron (&quot;Ardea purpurea&quot;). The Australian white-faced heron is often incorrectly called a grey heron. In Ireland, the grey heron is often colloquially called a &quot;crane&quot;.

==Description==

The grey heron is a large bird, standing up to tall and measuring long with a wingspan. The body weight can range from . The plumage is largely ashy-grey above, and greyish-white below, with some black on the flanks. Adults have a white head and neck with a broad black supercilium that terminates in the slender, dangling crest, and bluish-black streaks on the front of the neck. The scapular feathers and the feathers at the base of the neck are somewhat elongated. Immature birds lack the dark stripe on the head and are generally duller in appearance than adults, with a grey head and neck, and a small, dark grey crest. The pinkish-yellow beak is long, straight, and powerful, and is brighter in color in breeding adults. The iris is yellow and the legs are brown and very long.

The main call is a loud croaking &quot;fraaank&quot;, but a variety of guttural and raucous noises are heard at the breeding colony. The male uses an advertisement call to encourage a female to join him at the nest, and both sexes use various greeting calls after a pair bond has been established. A loud, harsh &quot;schaah&quot; is used by the male in driving other birds from the vicinity of the nest and a soft &quot;gogogo&quot; expresses anxiety, as when a predator is nearby or a human walks past the colony. The chicks utter loud chattering or ticking noises.

==Distribution and habitat==


The grey heron has an extensive range throughout most of the Palearctic realm. The range of the nominate subspecies &quot;A. c. cinerea&quot; extends to 70° N in Norway and 66°N in Sweden, but its northerly limit is around 60°N across the rest of Europe and Asia, as far eastwards as the Ural Mountains. To the south, its range extends to northern Spain, France, central Italy, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Iraq, Iran, India, The Maldives and Myanmar (Burma). It is also present in Africa south of the Sahara Desert, the Canary Islands, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and many of the Mediterranean Islands. It is replaced by &quot;A. c. jouyi&quot; in eastern Siberia, Mongolia, eastern China, Hainan, Japan, and Taiwan. In Madagascar and the Aldabra Islands, the subspecies &quot;A. c. firasa&quot; is found, while the subspecies &quot;A. c. monicae&quot; is restricted to Mauritania and offshore islands.

Over much of its range, the grey heron is resident, but birds from the more northerly parts of Europe migrate southwards, some remaining in Central and Southern Europe, others travelling on to Africa south of the Sahara Desert.

The grey heron is also known to be vagrant in the Caribbean, Bermuda, Iceland, Greenland, the Aleutian Islands, and Newfoundland, with a few confirmed sightings in other parts of North America including Nova Scotia and Nantucket.

Within its range, the grey heron can be found anywhere with suitable watery habitat that can supply its food. The water body must be either shallow enough, or have a shelving margin in it, so that it can wade. Although most common in the lowlands, it also occurs in mountain tarns, lakes, reservoirs, rivers, marshes, ponds, ditches, flooded areas, coastal lagoons, estuaries, and the sea shore. It sometimes forages away from water in pasture, and it has been recorded in desert areas, hunting for beetles and lizards. Breeding colonies are usually near feeding areas, but exceptionally may be up to away, and birds sometimes forage as much as from the nesting site.

==Behaviour==
The grey heron has a slow flight, with its long neck retracted in an S-shape. This is characteristic of herons and bitterns, and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, and spoonbills, which extend their necks. It flies with slow wing-beats and sometimes glides for short distances. It sometimes soars, circling to considerable heights, but not as often as the stork. In spring, and occasionally in autumn, birds may soar high above the heronry and chase each other, undertake aerial manoeuvres or swoop down towards the ground. The birds often perch in trees, but spend much time on the ground, striding about or standing still for long periods with an upright stance, often on a single leg.
===Diet and feeding===

Grey herons are apex predators in their aquatic ecosystem. Fish, amphibians, crustaceans, and insects are caught in shallow water with the heron&#x27;s long bill. It has also been observed catching and killing juvenile birds such as ducklings, and occasionally takes birds up to the size of a water rail or white-throated rail. Small mammals such as water voles, rats, stoats and young rabbits are additionally caught. Recently, the grey heron has been observed to use the ‘stress and wash’ technique which is believed to make great crested newts (&quot;Triturus cristatus&quot;) and smooth newts (&quot;Lissotriton vulgaris&quot;) more palatable by flushing their skin free of toxins before consumption.

Prey items vary in size from 1 cm-long fish and invertebrates, weighing less than 1g, to 30 cm-long carps and 57cm eels. While chicks tend to have smaller prey, individual prey caught by fully-grown Grey Herons commonly exceed 100g in weight and occasionally exceed 500g. One paper reports that an adult heron managed to catch and swallow sea trout weighing 680g. It may stand motionless in the shallows, or on a rock or sandbank beside the water, waiting for prey to come within striking distance. Alternatively, it moves slowly and stealthily through the water with its body less upright than when at rest and its neck curved in an &quot;S&quot;. It is then able to straighten its neck and strike with its bill very quickly. Small fish are swallowed head first, and larger prey and eels are carried to the shore where they are subdued by being beaten on the ground or stabbed by the bill. They are then swallowed or have hunks of flesh torn off. For prey such as small mammals and birds or ducklings, the prey is held by the neck and either drowned, suffocated, has its neck snapped with the heron&#x27;s beak, or is bludgeoned against the ground or a nearby rock, before being swallowed whole. The bird regurgitates pellets of indigestible material such as fur, bones, and the chitinous remains of insects. The main hunting periods are around dawn and dusk, but it is also active at other times of the day. At night it roosts in trees or on cliffs, where it tends to be gregarious.

===Breeding===

This species breeds in colonies known as heronries, usually in high trees close to lakes, the seashore, or other wetlands. Other sites are sometimes chosen, and these include low trees and bushes, bramble patches, reed beds, heather clumps and cliff ledges. The same nest is used year after year until blown down; it starts as a small platform of sticks but expands into a bulky nest as more material is added in subsequent years. It may be lined with smaller twigs, strands of root or dead grasses; in reed beds, it is built from dead reeds. The male usually collects the material, while the female constructs the nest. Breeding activities take place between February and June. When a bird arrives at the nest, a greeting ceremony occurs in which each partner raises and lowers its wings and plumes. In continental Europe, and elsewhere, nesting colonies sometimes include nests of the purple heron and other heron species.

Courtship involves the male calling from his chosen nesting site. On the arrival of the female, both birds participate in a stretching ceremony, in which each bird extends its neck vertically before bringing it backwards and downwards with the bill remaining vertical, simultaneously flexing its legs, before returning to its normal stance. The snapping ceremony is another behaviour where the neck is extended forward, the head is lowered to the level of the feet, and the mandibles are vigorously snapped together. This may be repeated 20-40 times. When the pairing is settled, the birds may caress each other by attending to the other bird&#x27;s plumage. The male may then offer the female a stick, which she incorporates into the nest. At this, the male becomes excited, further preening the female, and copulation takes place.
The clutch of eggs usually numbers three to five, though as few as two and as many as seven eggs have been recorded. The eggs have a matt surface and are greenish-blue, averaging . The eggs are normally laid at two-day intervals and incubation usually starts after the first or second egg has been laid. Both birds take part in incubation and the period lasts about 25 days. Both parents bring food for the young. At first, the chicks seize the adult&#x27;s bill from the side and extract regurgitated food from it. Later, the adult disgorges the food at the nest and the chicks squabble for possession. They fledge at 7-8 weeks. Usually, a single brood is raised each year, but two broods have been recorded.

The oldest recorded bird lived for 23 years, but the average life expectancy in the wild is about 5 years. Only about a third of juveniles survive into their second year, many falling victim to predation.

On May 24, 1990, on the proposal of Marek Vahula, the nesting colony of Vandu village of Kadrina municipality (up to 125 nesting trees) was taken under protection in the 1st place. In the spring-winter of 2001, all suitable nesting trees were cut down there in defiance of the conservation regulations. Driven by this, the nationwide heron protection and research project &quot;The Heron Seeker&quot; was brought to life. In seven years (2007-2014) all nesting colonies and feeding grounds in Estonia were mapped. The project&#x27;s final result was the English-language E-book: &quot;Heron Seeker`s book&quot; Tallinn, 2024. (ISBN 978-9916-9943-3-7). 

===City life===
Grey herons have the ability to live in cities where habitats and nesting space are available. In the Netherlands, it has established itself over the past decades in great numbers in urban environments. In cities such as Amsterdam, they are ever present and well adapted to modern city life. They hunt as usual, but also visit street markets and snack bars. Some individuals make use of people feeding them at their homes or share the catch of recreational fishermen. Similar behaviour on a smaller scale has been reported in Ireland. Garden ponds stocked with ornamental fish are attractive to herons, and the easy prey may provide young birds with a learning opportunity on how to hunt.

Herons have been observed visiting water enclosures in zoos, such as spaces for penguins, otters, pelicans, and seals, and taking food meant for the animals on display.

=== Harm caused by Grey Herons ===
In a variety of sources, one can find a common statement that grey herons, by eating large quantities of fish, is a significant pest of fisheries, causing damage to the population of valuable fish both in natural reservoirs and in ponds intended for the cultivation of cultivated fish species. 

For example, in the 1970s, major Soviet experts considered the grey heron to be a harmful species, for example, for fish breeding reservoirs in Ukraine. In particular, it was established that in Ukraine and in general in the southern regions of the USSR,  carp and mullet suffered from heron farms (there, in addition, the heron caught fish in the dark, which made it difficult to fight it). It was undoubtedly noted that grey herons, especially in the post-nesting period, when forage migrations begin, gather in significant numbers on fish ponds and then eat many juveniles of cultivated fish species. In the Kuban delta, the share of valuable, specially cultivated species was significant in the hunting of the grey heron, of which 84% were carp, 12% were white carp, and  4%  were Bighead carp.

According to studies at fish ponds in Upper Lusatia in Germany, the grey heron does cause significant damage to fisheries, but the damage caused by eating valuable fish species is balanced by the fact that it eats a large number of fish affected by ligulosis. The undoubted benefit of the heron is also expressed in the fact that it eats a lot of harmful insects. However, in some places, grey herons can serve as a breeding ground for the so-called ink sickness, or postodiplostomosis, a dangerous disease of young cyprinids.

In addition, large colonies of grey herons can have a significant impact on soil biogeochemistry and vegetation. For example, a heron colony in one study site located near the southern edge of the Republic of Tatarstan on a peninsula formed by the confluence of the Volga, the largest and longest river in Europe, and its largest tributary, the Kama, on the banks of the smaller river Myosha (a tributary of the Kama); after settling around 2006, it expanded for 15 years, leading to the intensive deposition of nutrients with faeces, food remains and feathers thereby considerably altering the local soil biogeochemistry. Thus, lower pH levels around 4.5, 10- and 2-fold higher concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen, as well as 1.2-fold discrepancies in K, Li, Mn, Zn and Co, respectively, compared to the surrounding control forest area could be observed.

== Predators and parasites ==

Being large birds with powerful beaks, grey herons have few predators as adults, but white-tailed eagles, golden eagles and more rarely Eurasian goshawks will take them as prey. The eggs and young are more vulnerable; the adult birds do not usually leave the nest unattended, but may be lured away by marauding crows or kites. A dead grey heron found in the Pyrenees is thought to have been killed by an otter. The bird may have been weakened by harsh winter weather causing scarcity of its prey.

A study performed by Sitko and Heneberg in the Czech Republic between 1962 and 2013 suggested that Central European grey herons host 29 species of parasitic worms. The dominant species consisted of &quot;Apharyngostrigea cornu&quot; (67% prevalence), &quot;Posthodiplostomum cuticola&quot; (41% prevalence), &quot;Echinochasmus beleocephalus&quot; (39% prevalence), &quot;Uroproctepisthmium bursicola&quot; (36% prevalence), &quot;Neogryporhynchus cheilancristrotus&quot; (31% prevalence), &quot;Desmidocercella numidica&quot; (29% prevalence), and &quot;Bilharziella polonica&quot; (5% prevalence). Juvenile grey herons were shown to host fewer species, but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adult herons. Of the digenean flatworms found in Central European grey herons, 52% of the species likely infected their definitive hosts outside Central Europe itself, in the premigratory, migratory, or wintering quarters, despite the fact that a substantial proportion of grey herons do not migrate to the south.

==In human culture==

Bennu, an ancient Egyptian deity associated with the sun, creation, and rebirth, was depicted as a heron in New Kingdom artwork.

In ancient Rome, the heron was a bird of divination that gave an augury (sign of a coming event) by its call, like the raven, stork, and owl.

Roast heron was once a specially prized dish in Britain for special occasions such as state banquets. For the appointment of George Neville as Archbishop of York in 1465, 400 herons were served to the guests. Young birds were still being shot and eaten in Romney Marsh in 1896. Two grey herons feature in a stained-glass window of the church in Selborne, Hampshire.

The English surnames Earnshaw, Hernshaw, Herne, and Heron all derive from the heron, the suffix -shaw meaning a wood, referring to a place where herons nested.

The bird is common in the Maldives under the name of &quot;Maakana&quot; and has given its name to the character of a satirical TV show.

<doc id="238198" wikidata="Q1247556" url="?curid=238198" title="Rhoda">
<text>Rhoda is an American sitcom television series created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns starring Valerie Harper that originally aired on CBS for five seasons from September 9, 1974, to May 18, 1979. It was the first spin-off of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; in which Harper reprised her role as Rhoda Morgenstern, a spunky and flamboyantly fashioned young woman seen as unconventional by the standards of her Jewish family from New York City. The series was originally distributed by Viacom Enterprises.

&quot;Rhoda&quot; begins as the character returns to New York where she soon meets and marries Joe Gerard. The series&#x27; third season chronicled the characters&#x27; separation and &quot;Rhoda&quot;″s later seasons revolved mainly around the character&#x27;s misadventures as a single divorcée. Main co-stars included Julie Kavner as Rhoda&#x27;s sister Brenda alongside Nancy Walker as their mother Ida Morgenstern. Other co-stars throughout the series included &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; writer Lorenzo Music as Rhoda and Brenda&#x27;s scarcely seen doorman Carlton, Harold Gould as their father Martin Morgenstern, Ron Silver as their neighbor Gary Levy, Ray Buktenica as Brenda&#x27;s boyfriend and later fiancé Benny Goodwin, and Kenneth McMillan as Rhoda&#x27;s boss Jack Doyle.

A large ratings success during its first two seasons, &quot;Rhoda&quot;″s viewership suffered following the creative decision to dissolve the marriage of Rhoda and Joe as series creators Brooks and Burns believed that the title character had lost her &quot;edge&quot; as a married woman. The series&#x27; later seasons failed to recapture the commercial success it had initially enjoyed and CBS ultimately cancelled &quot;Rhoda&quot; midway through its fifth season in 1978, leaving several unaired episodes that later appeared in syndication. &quot;Rhoda&quot; was the recipient of two Golden Globe Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards, and was filmed Friday evenings in front of a live studio audience at CBS Studio Center, Stage 14 in Studio City, Los Angeles, California.

==Broadcast history==

==Synopsis==
===Seasons 1 and 2 (1974–1976)===
The pilot episode, entitled &quot;Joe&quot;, aired on CBS on Monday, September 9, 1974, at 9:30 p.m. and immediately set a record by being the first television series ever to achieve a number-one Nielsen rating for its premiere episode, defeating the ABC ratings juggernaut, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in the process. ABC aired a college football game, Notre Dame versus Georgia Tech, to fill a gap one week before the start of the NFL season.

The episode opens with Rhoda Morgenstern traveling from her home in Minneapolis to New York City, where she was born and raised, for a two-week vacation, staying with her younger sister, Brenda (Julie Kavner). Brenda works as a bank teller and suffers from low self-esteem exacerbated by dating problems, similar to how Rhoda herself had experienced difficulty in dating in Minneapolis in the early years of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.
While there, she meets Joe Gerard (David Groh), a handsome divorcé who owns a wrecking company and has a ten-year-old son, Donny, whom Brenda babysits. Following Brenda&#x27;s prompting, Rhoda and Joe meet and develop an instant attraction to each other which leads to their dating nightly for the duration of her vacation. After an argument about their feelings for each other, Joe asks Rhoda to stay in New York City, which she does, initially moving in with Brenda at 332 E. 64th Street (however, actual exterior shots are of 332 East 84th Street, between 1st and 2nd Avenues on the southeast end of the block).

Rhoda and Brenda soon realize that the small studio apartment can&#x27;t hold them both, so Rhoda moves in with their parents Ida (Nancy Walker) and Martin (Harold Gould) at their apartment in The Bronx. Ida and Martin are the stereotypical Jewish parents. Ida is overbearing, overprotective, benevolently manipulative, and desperate to ensure her daughters find good husbands. Martin is her dutiful, mild-mannered husband. Ida initially goes to great lengths to baby her daughter. When it becomes apparent Rhoda is sliding into a rut by occupying her childhood bedroom, Ida forces her to move out for her own good.
As the weeks go by, the relationship between Joe and Rhoda quickly blossoms. By the sixth episode, &quot;Pop Goes the Question&quot;, an insecure Rhoda asks Joe where their relationship is heading. His response is to invite Rhoda to move in with him. After some careful thought, and consultation with her sister and father, Rhoda accepts Joe&#x27;s invitation, but within minutes of moving in decides that rather than living together out of wedlock she prefers to be married. Rhoda attempts to convince Joe that they are very compatible and would be a happily married couple. After some hesitation, Joe agrees and a wedding is planned.

====Rhoda&#x27;s wedding====

Eight weeks into the series, on Monday, October 28, 1974, Rhoda and Joe were married in a special hour-long episode that broke several television viewership records. Heavily publicized, it became the highest-rated television episode of the 1970s, a record it held until the miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; claimed that achievement in 1977. Additionally, on the night of its airing it became the second-most-watched television episode of all time, surpassed only by the 1953 episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in which Little Ricky was born.

It was watched by more than 52 million Americans, over half of the US viewing audience, and is still the second most-watched primetime wedding (Max Klinger&#x27;s wedding in the final episode of M*A*S*H had 110 million viewers but was not the main plotline). At the conclusion of the episode, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; host Howard Cosell joked on ABC that he had not been invited to the wedding, and welcomed viewers back to the game. Hundreds of &quot;wedding parties&quot; were held by fans across the United States on the night of the episode to celebrate the television wedding, and within days the CBS-TV studios were inundated with wedding gifts sent in by fans for the fictional Joe and Rhoda Gerard. The episode was overwhelmingly praised by critics, widely touted as a &quot;television phenomenon&quot;, &quot;unlike anything that had happened on television for nearly twenty years&quot;, and garnered Harper her fourth Emmy award in 1975. &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine reported that people across the country had pulled off the road checking into motels, and that friends had canceled dinner invitations (feigning illness), just to watch Rhoda&#x27;s wedding.

The wedding episode featured guest appearances by many of the main characters from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, including Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), Lou Grant (Edward Asner), Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod), Georgette Franklin (Georgia Engel), and Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman). The only major characters who didn&#x27;t attend were Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) and Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White).

In &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; episode &quot;The New Sue Ann&quot;, airing Saturday, October 26, 1974, two days before &quot;Rhoda&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, the characters frequently discuss the upcoming event and buy wedding gifts. At the end of the episode Murray and Lou leave the TV station to drive Mary to the airport. During &quot;Rhoda&#x27;s Wedding&quot; it is revealed that on a lark Lou and Murray have decided to fly to New York with Mary to surprise Rhoda. Her frequent nemesis, Phyllis, who intentionally had not been invited, nonetheless flies in for the wedding, and Mary and Rhoda&#x27;s friend, Georgette, drives in from Minneapolis.

During the episode, Phyllis asks for the opportunity to participate in the wedding and is appointed the responsibility to pick up Rhoda at Brenda&#x27;s Manhattan apartment and drive her to her parents&#x27; apartment in the Bronx, where the ceremony is being held. The self-absorbed and forgetful Phyllis neglects to keep her promise. This forces Rhoda to take the subway, running through the streets of Manhattan and the Bronx fully regaled in her wedding dress and veil and dashing into her parents&#x27; apartment building in one of the most memorable moments in the history of series television.

In a state of shock, Ida refuses Phyllis&#x27;s profuse apologies, saying &quot;I&#x27;ll kill you&quot;. Phyllis begs everyone in the room to forgive her, but the only one who does is Georgette, who then suggests to Phyllis that she leave before Rhoda arrives. The episode also features special closing credits, showing additional footage of Rhoda (Harper) running down a Manhattan street in her wedding dress and veil accompanied by an alternative version of the theme song played to the tune of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Wedding March&quot;.
For the remainder of the first and second seasons, the show focuses on Rhoda and Joe&#x27;s new married life. The two move into a penthouse suite in the same building as Brenda. Rhoda advances in her career as a window dresser by opening up a small window dressing business called &quot;Windows by Rhoda&quot; with her old high school friend Myrna Morgenstein (Barbara Sharma). Rhoda uses her own maiden surname &quot;Morgenstern&quot; in her professional dealings as a window dresser and her married surname &quot;Gerard&quot; in her personal life.

During this period, the show was a massive ratings hit on Monday nights, staying near the top of the ratings in both seasons, even faring better than its parent, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. In early seasons, the closing credits of the series featured Rhoda on a New York street trying to imitate Mary Tyler Moore&#x27;s trademark hat toss, but the cap slips from Rhoda&#x27;s hand before she can throw it. Upon moving from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; to her own eponymous series, Rhoda&#x27;s Jewish religious and ethnic background seemed to fade as she was no longer unique, and would be surrounded by a host of New Yorkers of different religions and ethnicities.

Throughout the tenure of Rhoda Morgenstern&#x27;s character being featured on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, her &quot;Jewishness&quot; was discussed on several episodes. Such episodes included: &quot;Some of My Best Friends are Rhoda&quot; from which the subject of anti-Semitism was covered; &quot;Enter Rhoda&#x27;s Parents&quot;, from which Rhoda&#x27;s parents renewed their wedding vows by a rabbi; and &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Mother Is Not Her Friend&quot;, in which Ida wanted to fix Mary up with an eligible bachelor, a man whom she&#x27;d deemed inappropriate for Rhoda, as he wasn&#x27;t Jewish. This candid expression of &quot;Jewishness&quot; changed, however, when &quot;Rhoda&quot; was spun off in 1974. During the first season of &quot;Rhoda&quot;, the representation of Rhoda Morgenstern altered from her parent show to fit a more mainstream audience: she was trimmer, more confident, and less &quot;Jewish&quot;. Throughout the first season, there were scant references about Rhoda&#x27;s &quot;Jewishness&quot;.

Moreover, there was even a Christmas episode with no mention of the character&#x27;s Jewish background entitled, &quot;Guess What I Got You for the Holidays&quot;. Thus, the creation of Rhoda&#x27;s own series stifled the representation of &quot;Jewishness&quot; – as Charlotte Brown, the executive producer of &quot;Rhoda&quot;, conveyed in an interview the display of &quot;Jewishness&quot;, &quot;was just &#x27;set dressing&#x27; – Ida&#x27;s brisket, her plastic on the furniture&quot;. Ironically, although Harper and Walker achieved great popularity playing characters of the Jewish faith and ethnicity, in real life, neither actress was Jewish.

In the first season of &quot;Rhoda&quot;, Mary Tyler Moore made four guest appearances as Mary Richards to help with the transition of Rhoda moving from Minneapolis to New York City, getting married, and establishing her new life. The episodes Moore appeared in were: the premiere episode &quot;Joe&quot;; the sixth installment &quot;Pop Goes The Question&quot;; the two-part hour- long episode &quot;Rhoda&#x27;s Wedding&quot; – which also featured other characters from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; such as Lou Grant (Edward Asner), Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod), Georgette Franklin (Georgia Engel), and Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman) – and the season finale &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot;. During the second season, Moore made no appearances on &quot;Rhoda&quot;, but Valerie Harper and David Groh were briefly featured as Rhoda and Joe Gerard on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;&#x27;s eleventh installment of the sixth season &quot;Mary Richards Falls in Love&quot;.

===Season 3 (1976–1977)===

In the first episode of the third season during a particularly dramatic scene Joe leaves Rhoda and the two remain separated for the entire season, with Groh appearing in only nine of the season&#x27;s episodes. A few weeks later, they mutually agree to see a marriage counselor where Joe reveals to a stunned Rhoda that he had never wanted to be married, and that he married her only because she had pressured him into it after he had invited her to live with him.

Audiences were equally stunned and deserted the program in droves. Although the producers believed the plot development was essential, the fan response to Rhoda and Joe&#x27;s separation was overwhelmingly negative and hostile. CBS was inundated with thousands of angry letters protesting the plot development, &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;Joe&quot; received sympathy cards and letters of condolence, with Groh later reporting that he had received hate mail for as much as a year after the season had ended. This sentiment would translate into a steep ratings decline during the course of the season and the show ranked #25 for the 1976–77 season (falling from #7 the year before). Though Ida appears in the opening episode (&quot;The Separation&quot;), both she and Martin are absent for the remainder of the season, explained as traveling across the country in an RV. In reality, Nancy Walker departed the program to headline two short-lived ABC series: &quot;The Nancy Walker Show&quot;, and &quot;Blansky&#x27;s Beauties&quot;; and Harold Gould left to star in his own ABC show, &quot;The Feather and Father Gang&quot;. To help fill in the void left by Walker and Gould, the producers hired comedian Anne Meara as Rhoda&#x27;s new friend, Sally Gallagher, a middle-aged divorcee who works as an airline stewardess. Viewers did not warm to Meara and her character lasted only one season.

With Rhoda and Joe now separated, they soon move out of their apartment. Joe moves to another building while Rhoda trades apartments with downstairs neighbor Gary Levy (Ron Silver), a jean-store owner who soon strikes up a platonic friendship with Rhoda. Stories initially center on Rhoda and Joe&#x27;s attempts to work through their differences. As the season progresses, however, Joe is seen less frequently and episodes show Rhoda coping with her single status or feature Brenda-themed stories. Ultimately, they never reconcile and Joe is never seen again after this season. Johnny Venture (Michael DeLano), a lounge singer, becomes an occasional suitor/friend whom Rhoda begrudgingly tolerates. Meanwhile, Brenda, no longer overweight but still with self-esteem problems, finally finds a steady boyfriend in enthusiastic rollerskater and toll-booth worker Benny Goodwin (Ray Buktenica), who is, initially, constantly assumed to be the son of great big band conductor/musician, Benny Goodman. She also occasionally dates neighbor Gary Levy as well as continuing her casual relationship with immature accordion player Nick Lobo.

During the third season of &quot;Rhoda&quot;, Mary Tyler Moore made her final guest appearance as Mary Richards in the eighteenth installment &quot;The Ultimatum&quot;. Also that year, Valerie Harper appeared as Rhoda, along with Cloris Leachman as Phyllis, on the final episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; entitled &quot;The Last Show&quot;.

===Season 4 (1977–1978)===

For the fourth season, Rhoda re-emerged with a new, slimmer look. (Before the season started, Valerie Harper went on a liquid protein diet, which was quite controversial at the time, and dropped 40 pounds.) Rhoda&#x27;s divorce is finalized and she resumes use of her maiden name &quot;Morgenstern&quot; full time. (From this point on, neither her ex-husband, Joe Gerard, nor Rhoda&#x27;s friend from the previous season, Sally Gallagher, are ever mentioned again.) The show then centers on her role as a thirty-something divorcée, rarely dating and focusing on her career. Ida and Martin come home after a year&#x27;s absence from their lengthy cross-country trip (in reality, both Nancy Walker&#x27;s and Harold Gould&#x27;s attempts at new series the previous year had failed).

Brenda continues to date Gary Levy and Benny Goodwin, one more than the other. Meanwhile, Rhoda&#x27;s career is undergoing a transition. Seeking a career change, she finds a job at the Doyle Costume Company. There she works for the gruff Jack Doyle (Kenneth McMillan), a man with similarities to Lou Grant. Season 4 ranked higher than season 3 in the ratings (finishing at #21 for the year), but &quot;Rhoda&quot; never regained the popularity it had achieved during its first two seasons.

===Season 5 (September–December 1978)===
In September, 1978, the show underwent additional changes for the fifth and final season. Rhoda sports a new longer frizzy-permed hair style, which she keeps pulled back in a small ponytail for part of the season. Ida and Martin go through a separation of their own, and Martin goes off to Florida to find himself. He returns after several episodes, but Ida wants to be wooed back, leading to dating and other romantic rituals between the two. Brenda and Benny get engaged to be married, with their wedding planned for later in the season (though this would ultimately not happen, due to &quot;Rhoda&quot;&#x27;s abrupt midseason cancellation). Gary Levy does not return for this season; it is mentioned near the season&#x27;s start in Episode 3 that he has moved to Chicago. A new coworker, Tina Molinari (Nancy Lane), joins Rhoda and Jack at the costume shop, having appeared in several Season 4 episodes as an employee at Gary&#x27;s jeans store.

At this time, the series, along with the Norman Lear sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot;, was moved to Saturday nights, with &quot;Rhoda&quot; airing at 8:00 P.M. and &quot;Good Times&quot; at 8:30 P.M. As a result of the show&#x27;s competing against NBC&#x27;s popular police series &quot;CHiPs&quot;, the ratings for both programs declined drastically. CBS canceled &quot;Rhoda&quot; in December 1978—midway through its fifth season—with four episodes remaining unaired, though these episodes later aired in syndication. The show ended its final season ranked at #95 out of 114 shows. &quot;Good Times&quot; was pulled from the CBS schedule in December and returned in the spring of 1979 on Wednesday nights at 8:30 P.M. It finished its sixth season, but its ratings did not improve, with the show ranked at #91. Within a few months, CBS also canceled it.

Some, like Heckart and Vance, were well-known performers, while the appearance of others, like Mayron and Hesseman, preceded their own shows or roles that brought them to prominence.

==Syndication==
In 1979, &quot;Rhoda&quot; began airing in syndication to local stations, and was originally syndicated by Victory Television from 1979 to 1987. From 1981 to 1988, reruns of the show aired on WGN-TV in Chicago. In 1990, reruns of &quot;Rhoda&quot; aired on Ha!. In 1996, Nick at Nite began airing reruns of &quot;Rhoda&quot;.

==Home media==

===DVD releases===
On April 21, 2009, Shout! Factory released the first season of &quot;Rhoda&quot; on DVD in Region 1, which was the year of the show&#x27;s 35th anniversary. The release also includes a &quot;Remembering Rhoda&quot; featurette, as well as the original one-hour version of &quot;Rhoda&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, as opposed to the two-part edited version that aired in syndication. 15 of the season&#x27;s 24 episodes are the edited-for-syndication versions taken from poor quality masters, while the other 9 episodes (including the Wedding episode) are the unedited network versions. A review on DVDTalk also states some of the edited episodes being time compressed. Because the series premiere in the DVD set is the syndicated version, Mary Tyler Moore&#x27;s appearance at the beginning of the episode is not included. However, the full version of the pilot can be viewed at The Paley Center for Media in New York and Los Angeles. Footage from the missing scene is even included in the end credits to the series premiere.

Season two and Season three episodes were released unedited.
Season four was released on September 21, 2010, as a Shout! Factory select title, available exclusively through their online store.

Season four was re-released as a general retail release on August 15, 2017.

Season five was released by Shout! Factory on October 17, 2017.

===VHS releases===
A two-tape set, &quot;Rhoda—Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot; containing two episodes on each cassette, was released by MTM Home Video in July 1992.

==Animated spin-off and cast reunions==
An animated TV pilot titled &quot;Carlton Your Doorman&quot;, a proposed spin-off of the Carlton, the doorman character (voiced by Lorenzo Music), was broadcast May 21, 1980 on CBS. Although the episode won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, it was never picked up by the network as a series.

Despite never having reunited in-character on a TV special or movie, some of the cast members of &quot;Rhoda&quot; have gotten together over the years on the following daytime talk-shows:

* On November 21, 1984, Valerie Harper, Julie Kavner and Nancy Walker reunited to reminisce about the series on the syndicated &quot;Hour Magazine&quot; (with Gary Collins) in which they hosted a week-long series dedicated to TV reunion shows.
* In May 1996, Valerie Harper, David Groh and Harold Gould (with a voice-over cameo from Lorenzo Music as Carlton, the Doorman) reunited on &quot;Sally Jessy Raphael&quot; to talk about the show&#x27;s best moments as reruns of &quot;Rhoda&quot; began airing on &quot;Nick at Nite&quot;. Author Julius C. Burnett (author of &quot;Rhoda Revisited&quot;; see below) also appeared briefly in the segment. Interesting episodic facts from Burnett&#x27;s book were used during a voiceover at the beginning of each episode of &quot;Nick at Nite&quot;″s reruns of the series.

==Books==
In 1975, Scholastic Books published &quot;All About &quot;Rhoda&quot;&quot;, a non-fiction paperback about the development of the series and the character. The book features interviews with Harper and Groh, and 32 black-and-white photos. &quot;All About &quot;Rhoda&quot;&quot; was referenced in an episode of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; during a sketch in which the character Buddy Cole (played by Scott Thompson) identified it as the book he would most want to have with him if he was stranded on a desert island.

Julius C. Burnett wrote &quot;Rhoda Revisited&quot;, which summarized the series (with a foreword by Valerie Harper) and was released by Ju-Ju &amp; Co. Entertainment LLC on December 21, 2010.

<text>In physical chemistry, Henry&#x27;s law is a gas law that states that the amount of dissolved gas in a liquid is directly proportional at equilibrium to its partial pressure above the liquid. The proportionality factor is called Henry&#x27;s law constant. It was formulated by the English chemist William Henry, who studied the topic in the early 19th century.
In simple words, we can say that the partial pressure of a gas in vapour phase is directly proportional to the mole fraction of a gas in solution.

An example where Henry&#x27;s law is at play is the depth-dependent dissolution of oxygen and nitrogen in the blood of underwater divers that changes during decompression, going to decompression sickness. An everyday example is carbonated soft drinks, which contain dissolved carbon dioxide. Before opening, the gas above the drink in its container is almost pure carbon dioxide, at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. After the bottle is opened, this gas escapes, moving the partial pressure of carbon dioxide above the liquid to be much lower, resulting in degassing as the dissolved carbon dioxide comes out of the solution.
== History ==
In his 1803 publication about the quantity of gases absorbed by water, William Henry described the results of his experiments:
Charles Coulston Gillispie states that John Dalton &quot;supposed that the separation of gas particles one from another in the vapor phase bears the ratio of a small whole number to their interatomic distance in solution. Henry&#x27;s law follows as a consequence if this ratio is a constant for each gas at a given temperature.&quot;

==Applications==

=== In production of carbonated beverages ===

Under high pressure, solubility of increases. On opening a container of a carbonated beverage under pressure, pressure decreases to atmospheric, so that solubility decreases and the carbon dioxide forms bubbles that are released from the liquid.

=== In the service of cask-conditioned beer ===
It is often noted that beer served by gravity (that is, directly from a tap in the cask) is less heavily carbonated than the same beer served via a hand-pump (or beer-engine). This is because beer is pressurised on its way to the point of service by the action of the beer engine, causing carbon dioxide to dissolve in the beer. This then comes out of solution once the beer has left the pump, causing a higher level of perceptible &#x27;condition&#x27; in the beer.

=== For climbers or people living at high altitude ===
Concentration of in the blood and tissues is so low that they feel weak and are unable to think properly, a condition called hypoxia.

=== In underwater diving ===
In underwater diving, gas is breathed at the ambient pressure which increases with depth due to the hydrostatic pressure. Solubility of gases increases with greater depth (greater pressure) according to Henry&#x27;s law, so the body tissues take on more gas over time in greater depths of water. When ascending the diver is decompressed and the solubility of the gases dissolved in the tissues decreases accordingly. If the supersaturation is too great, bubbles may form and grow, and the presence of these bubbles can cause blockages in capillaries, or distortion in the more solid tissues which can cause damage known as decompression sickness. To avoid this injury the diver must ascend slowly enough that the excess dissolved gas is carried away by the blood and released into the lung gas.

== Fundamental types and variants of Henry&#x27;s law constants ==
There are many ways to define the proportionality constant of Henry&#x27;s law, which can be subdivided into two fundamental types: One possibility is to put the aqueous phase into the numerator and the gaseous phase into the denominator (&quot;aq/gas&quot;). This results in the Henry&#x27;s law solubility constant formula_1. Its value increases with increased solubility. Alternatively, numerator and denominator can be switched (&quot;gas/aq&quot;), which results in the Henry&#x27;s law volatility constant formula_2. The value of formula_2 decreases with increased solubility. IUPAC describes several variants of both fundamental types. This results from the multiplicity of quantities that can be chosen to describe the composition of the two phases. Typical choices for the aqueous phase are molar concentration (formula_4), molality (formula_5), and molar mixing ratio (formula_6). For the gas phase, molar concentration (formula_7) and partial pressure (formula_8) are often used. It is not possible to use the gas-phase mixing ratio (formula_9) because at a given gas-phase mixing ratio, the aqueous-phase concentration formula_4 depends on the total pressure and thus the ratio formula_11 is not a constant. To specify the exact variant of the Henry&#x27;s law constant, two superscripts are used. They refer to the numerator and the denominator of the definition. For example, formula_12 refers to the Henry solubility defined as formula_13.

=== Henry&#x27;s law solubility constants &quot;Hs&quot; ===

==== Henry solubility defined via concentration (&quot;Hscp&quot;) ====

Atmospheric chemists often define the Henry solubility as

:formula_14.
Here formula_15 is the concentration of a species in the aqueous phase, and formula_8 is the partial pressure of that species in the gas phase under equilibrium conditions.

The SI unit for formula_12 is mol/(m3·Pa); however, often the unit M/atm is used, since formula_15 is usually expressed in M (1M = 1 mol/dm3) and formula_8 in atm (1atm = 101325Pa).

==== The dimensionless Henry solubility &quot;Hscc&quot; ====

The Henry solubility can also be expressed as the dimensionless ratio between the aqueous-phase concentration formula_15 of a species and its gas-phase concentration formula_21:

:formula_22.

For an ideal gas, the conversion is:

:formula_23

where formula_24 is the gas constant, and formula_25 is the temperature.

Sometimes, this dimensionless constant is called the &quot;water–air partitioning coefficient&quot; formula_26. It is closely related to the various, slightly different definitions of the &quot;Ostwald coefficient&quot; formula_27, as discussed by Battino (1984).

==== Henry solubility defined via aqueous-phase mixing ratio (&quot;Hsxp&quot;) ====

Another Henry&#x27;s law solubility constant is:

:formula_28 .

Here formula_6 is the molar mixing ratio in the aqueous phase. For a dilute aqueous solution the conversion between formula_6 and formula_15 is:

:formula_32.

where formula_33 is the density of water and formula_34 is the molar mass of water. Thus

:formula_35.

The SI unit for formula_36 is Pa−1, although atm−1 is still frequently used.

==== Henry solubility defined via molality (&quot;Hsbp&quot;) ====
It can be advantageous to describe the aqueous phase in terms of molality instead of concentration. The molality of a solution does not change with formula_25, since it refers to the &quot;mass&quot; of the solvent. In contrast, the concentration formula_38 does change with formula_25, since the density of a solution and thus its volume are temperature-dependent. Defining the aqueous-phase composition via molality has the advantage that any temperature dependence of the Henry&#x27;s law constant is a true solubility phenomenon and not introduced indirectly via a density change of the solution. Using molality, the Henry solubility can be defined as

:formula_40

Here formula_5 is used as the symbol for molality (instead of formula_42) to avoid confusion with the symbol formula_42 for mass. The SI unit for formula_44 is mol/(kg·Pa). There is no simple way to calculate formula_12 from formula_44, since the conversion between concentration formula_15 and molality formula_5 involves &quot;all&quot; solutes of a solution. For a solution with a total of formula_49 solutes with indices formula_50, the conversion is:

:formula_51

where formula_52 is the density of the solution, and formula_53 are the molar masses. Here formula_5 is identical to one of the formula_55 in the denominator. If there is only one solute, the equation simplifies to

:formula_56

Henry&#x27;s law is only valid for dilute solutions where formula_57 and formula_58. In this case the conversion reduces further to

:formula_59

and thus

:formula_60

==== The Bunsen coefficient &quot;α&quot; ====
According to Sazonov and Shaw, the dimensionless Bunsen coefficient formula_61 is defined as &quot;the volume of saturating gas, V1, reduced to T° = 273.15 K, p° = 1 bar, which is absorbed by unit volume V2* of pure solvent at the temperature of measurement and partial pressure of 1 bar.&quot; If the gas is ideal, the pressure cancels out, and the conversion to formula_12 is simply

:formula_63,

with formula_64 = 273.15K. Note, that according to this definition, the conversion factor is &quot;not&quot; temperature-dependent. Independent of the temperature that the Bunsen coefficient refers to, 273.15K is always used for the conversion. The Bunsen coefficient, which is named after Robert Bunsen, has been used mainly in the older literature, and IUPAC considers it to be obsolete.

==== The Kuenen coefficient &quot;S&quot; ====

According to Sazonov and Shaw, the Kuenen coefficient formula_65 is defined as &quot;the volume of saturating gas V(g), reduced to T° = 273.15 K, p° = bar, which is dissolved by unit mass of pure solvent at the temperature of measurement and partial pressure 1 bar.&quot; If the gas is ideal, the relation to formula_12 is

:formula_67,

where formula_52 is the density of the solvent, and formula_64 = 273.15 K. The SI unit for formula_65 is m3/kg. The Kuenen coefficient, which is named after Johannes Kuenen, has been used mainly in the older literature, and IUPAC considers it to be obsolete.

=== Henry&#x27;s law volatility constants &quot;H&quot;v ===

==== The Henry volatility defined via concentration (&quot;H&quot;) ====

A common way to define a Henry volatility is dividing the partial pressure by the aqueous-phase concentration:

:formula_71

The SI unit for formula_72 is Pa·m3/mol.

==== The Henry volatility defined via aqueous-phase mixing ratio (&quot;H&quot;) ====

Another Henry volatility is

:formula_73

The SI unit for formula_74 is Pa. However, atm is still frequently used.

==== The dimensionless Henry volatility &quot;H&quot; ====

The Henry volatility can also be expressed as the dimensionless ratio between the gas-phase concentration formula_21 of a species and its aqueous-phase concentration 

:formula_76

In chemical engineering and environmental chemistry, this dimensionless constant is often called the &quot;air–water partitioning coefficient&quot; 

== Values of Henry&#x27;s law constants ==

A large compilation of Henry&#x27;s law constants has been published by Sander (2023). A few selected values are shown in the table below:

== Temperature dependence ==
When the temperature of a system changes, the Henry constant also changes. The temperature dependence of equilibrium constants can generally be described with the Van &#x27;t Hoff equation, which also applies to Henry&#x27;s law constants:

:formula_77

where formula_78 is the enthalpy of dissolution. Note that the letter formula_79 in the symbol formula_78 refers to enthalpy and is not related to the letter formula_79 for Henry&#x27;s law constants. This applies to the Henry&#x27;s solubility ratio, formula_82; for Henry&#x27;s volatility ratio,formula_83, the sign of the right-hand side must be reversed. 

Integrating the above equation and creating an expression based on formula_84 at the reference temperature formula_85 = 298.15 K yields:

:formula_86

The van &#x27;t Hoff equation in this form is only valid for a limited temperature range in which formula_78 does not change much with temperature (around 20K of variations).

The following table lists some temperature dependencies: 
Solubility of permanent gases usually decreases with increasing temperature at around room temperature. However, for aqueous solutions, the Henry&#x27;s law solubility constant for many species goes through a minimum. For most permanent gases, the minimum is below 120 °C. Often, the smaller the gas molecule (and the lower the gas solubility in water), the lower the temperature of the maximum of the Henry&#x27;s law constant. Thus, the maximum is at about 30 °C for helium, 92 to 93 °C for argon, nitrogen and oxygen, and 114 °C for xenon.

== Effective Henry&#x27;s law constants ==
The Henry&#x27;s law constants mentioned so far do not consider any chemical equilibria in the aqueous phase. This type is called the &quot;intrinsic&quot;, or &quot;physical&quot;, Henry&#x27;s law constant. For example, the intrinsic Henry&#x27;s law solubility constant of formaldehyde can be defined as

:formula_88

In aqueous solution, formaldehyde is almost completely hydrated:

:&lt;chem&gt;H2CO + H2O &lt;=&gt; H2C(OH)2&lt;/chem&gt;

The total concentration of dissolved formaldehyde is

:formula_89

Taking this equilibrium into account, an effective Henry&#x27;s law constant formula_90 can be defined as

:formula_91

For acids and bases, the effective Henry&#x27;s law constant is not a useful quantity because it depends on the pH of the solution. In order to obtain a pH-independent constant, the product of the intrinsic Henry&#x27;s law constant formula_92 and the acidity constant formula_93 is often used for strong acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl):

:formula_94

Although formula_95 is usually also called a Henry&#x27;s law constant, it is a different quantity and it has different units than formula_92.

== Dependence on ionic strength (Sechenov equation) ==
Values of Henry&#x27;s law constants for aqueous solutions depend on the composition of the solution, i.e., on its ionic strength and on dissolved organics. In general, the solubility of a gas decreases with increasing salinity (&quot;salting out&quot;). However, a &quot;salting in&quot; effect has also been observed, for example for the effective Henry&#x27;s law constant of glyoxal. The effect can be described with the Sechenov equation, named after the Russian physiologist Ivan Sechenov (sometimes the German transliteration &quot;Setschenow&quot; of the Cyrillic name Се́ченов is used). There are many alternative ways to define the Sechenov equation, depending on how the aqueous-phase composition is described (based on concentration, molality, or molar fraction) and which variant of the Henry&#x27;s law constant is used. Describing the solution in terms of molality is preferred because molality is invariant to temperature and to the addition of dry salt to the solution. Thus, the Sechenov equation can be written as

:formula_97

where formula_98 is the Henry&#x27;s law constant in pure water, formula_44 is the Henry&#x27;s law constant in the salt solution, formula_100 is the molality-based Sechenov constant, and formula_101 is the molality of the salt.

== Non-ideal solutions ==
Henry&#x27;s law has been shown to apply to a wide range of solutes in the limit of &quot;infinite dilution&quot; (&quot;x&quot; → 0), including non-volatile substances such as sucrose. In these cases, it is necessary to state the law in terms of chemical potentials. For a solute in an ideal dilute solution, the chemical potential depends only on the concentration. For non-ideal solutions, the activity coefficients of the components must be taken into account:

:formula_102,

where formula_103 for a volatile solute; &quot;c&quot;° = 1 mol/L.

For non-ideal solutions, the infinite dilution activity coefficient &quot;γc&quot; depends on the concentration and must be determined at the concentration of interest. The activity coefficient can also be obtained for non-volatile solutes, where the vapor pressure of the pure substance is negligible, by using the Gibbs-Duhem relation:

:formula_104

By measuring the change in vapor pressure (and hence chemical potential) of the solvent, the chemical potential of the solute can be deduced.

The standard state for a dilute solution is also defined in terms of infinite-dilution behavior. Although the standard concentration &quot;c&quot;° is taken to be 1 mol/L by convention, the standard state is a hypothetical solution of 1 mol/L in which the solute has its limiting infinite-dilution properties. This has the effect that all non-ideal behavior is described by the activity coefficient: the activity coefficient at 1 mol/L is not necessarily unity (and is frequently quite different from unity).

All the relations above can also be expressed in terms of molalities &quot;b&quot; rather than concentrations, e.g.:

:formula_105

where formula_106 for a volatile solute; &quot;b&quot;° = 1 mol/kg.

The standard chemical potential &quot;μm&quot;°, the activity coefficient &quot;γm&quot; and the Henry&#x27;s law constant &quot;Hvpb&quot; all have different numerical values when molalities are used in place of concentrations.

=== Solvent mixtures ===

Henry&#x27;s law solubility constant formula_107 for a gas 2 in a mixture M of two solvents 1 and 3 depends on the individual constants for each solvent, formula_108 and formula_109 according to:
:formula_110

Where formula_111, formula_112 are the molar ratios of each solvent in the mixture and a13 is the interaction parameter of the solvents from Wohl expansion of the excess chemical potential of the ternary mixtures.

A similar relationship can be found for the volatility constant formula_113, by remembering that formula_114 and that, both being positive real numbers, formula_115, thus:

:formula_116

For a water-ethanol mixture, the interaction parameter a13 has values around formula_117 for ethanol concentrations (volume/volume) between 5% and 25%.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== In geochemistry ===

In geochemistry, a version of Henry&#x27;s law applies to the solubility of a noble gas in contact with silicate melt. One equation used is

:formula_118

where
:&quot;C&quot; is the number concentration of the solute gas in the melt and gas phases,
:&quot;β&quot; = 1/&quot;k&quot;B&quot;T&quot;, an inverse temperature parameter (&quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant),
:&quot;μ&quot;E is the excess chemical potentials of the solute gas in the two phases.

===Comparison to Raoult&#x27;s law===

Henry&#x27;s law is a limiting law that only applies for &quot;sufficiently dilute&quot; solutions, while Raoult&#x27;s law is generally valid when the liquid phase is almost pure or for mixtures of similar substances. The range of concentrations in which Henry&#x27;s law applies becomes narrower the more the system diverges from ideal behavior. Roughly speaking, that is the more chemically &quot;different&quot; the solute is from the solvent.

For a dilute solution, the concentration of the solute is approximately proportional to its mole fraction &quot;x&quot;, and Henry&#x27;s law can be written as

:formula_119

This can be compared with Raoult&#x27;s law:

:formula_120

where &quot;p&quot;* is the vapor pressure of the pure component.

At first sight, Raoult&#x27;s law appears to be a special case of Henry&#x27;s law, where &quot;Hvpx&quot; = &quot;p&quot;*. This is true for pairs of closely related substances, such as benzene and toluene, which obey Raoult&#x27;s law over the entire composition range: such mixtures are called ideal mixtures.

The general case is that both laws are limit laws, and they apply at opposite ends of the composition range. The vapor pressure of the component in large excess, such as the solvent for a dilute solution, is proportional to its mole fraction, and the constant of proportionality is the vapor pressure of the pure substance (Raoult&#x27;s law). The vapor pressure of the solute is also proportional to the solute&#x27;s mole fraction, but the constant of proportionality is different and must be determined experimentally (Henry&#x27;s law). In mathematical terms:
:Raoult&#x27;s law: formula_121
:Henry&#x27;s law: formula_122

Raoult&#x27;s law can also be related to non-gas solutes.

<doc id="238202" wikidata="Q160488" url="?curid=238202" title="Purple heron">
<text>The purple heron (Ardea purpurea) is a wide-ranging heron species. It breeds in Africa, central and southern Europe, and southern and eastern Palearctic. The Western Palearctic populations migrate between breeding and wintering habitats whereas the African and tropical-Asian populations are primarily sedentary, except for occasional dispersive movements.
It is similar in appearance to the more common grey heron but is slightly smaller, more slender and has darker plumage. It is also a more evasive bird, favouring densely vegetated habitats near water, particularly reed beds. It hunts for a range of prey including fish, rodents, frogs and insects, either stalking them or standing waiting in ambush.

Purple herons are colonial breeders and build a bulky nest out of dead reeds or sticks close to the water&#x27; edge among reeds or in dense vegetation. About five bluish-green eggs are laid and are incubated by both birds. The young hatch about four weeks later and fledge six weeks after that. The International Union for Conservation of Nature notes that the global population trend is downwards, largely because of the drainage of wetlands, but assesses the purple heron&#x27;s conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Description==

The purple heron is a large bird, in length with a standing height from and a wingspan. However, it is slender for its size, weighing only . It is somewhat smaller than the grey heron, from which it can be distinguished by its darker reddish-brown plumage, and, in adults, its darker grey back. Adults have the forehead and the crown of the head black, with a dark stripe down the back of the neck that terminates in a slender, dangling crest. This is shorter than the crest of the grey heron and does not exceed . The sides of the head and the neck are buffish chestnut, with dark streaks and lines down either side of the whole the neck. The mantle is oily brown and the upper scapular feathers are elongated but not the lower ones. The rest of the upper parts and the tail are brownish grey. The front of the neck is paler than the sides and there are some elongated feathers at the base of the neck which are streaked with white, chestnut and black. The breast is chestnut brown, with some blackening at the side, and the belly and under-tail coverts are black. The brownish-yellow beak is long, straight and powerful, and is brighter in colour in breeding adults. The iris is yellow and the legs are brown at the front and yellowish behind.

The call is a harsh &quot;frarnk&quot;, but is quieter and more high-pitched than that of the grey heron. It is generally a less noisy bird, though similar guttural sounds are heard emanating from the heronry. It is also less robust, and appears somewhat hollow-chested. Its head and neck are more slender and snake-like than the grey heron and its toes much longer. Unlike that bird, it often adopts a posture with its neck extending obliquely, and even nestlings tend to use this stance.

==Taxonomy and naming==
There are three or four subspecies:
* &quot;A. p. purpurea&quot; – : nominate, found in Africa, Europe north to the Netherlands, and southwestern Asia east to Kazakhstan.
* &quot;A. p. bournei&quot; – : Bourne&#x27;s heron. Found in the Cape Verde Islands, included in &quot;purpurea&quot; by some authors, but treated as a distinct species &quot;Ardea bournei&quot; by some others.
* &quot;A. p. madagascariensis&quot; – : found in Madagascar.
* &quot;A. p. manilensis&quot; – : found in Asia from the Indian Subcontinent east to the Philippines and Indonesia, and north to Primorsky Krai, Russia.

The scientific name comes from Latin &quot;ardea&quot; &quot;heron&quot;, and &quot;purpureus&quot;, &quot;coloured purple&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The purple heron has a mostly palaearctic distribution and breeds in Europe, Asia and Africa. The range of the western race extends from Portugal eastwards across much of central and southern Europe and parts of North Africa as far as Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan. In Africa, the bird breeds in Senegal, down the east coast of Africa and in Madagascar. The eastern race extends from the Indian Subcontinent, eastwards to eastern China and the Philippines, and northwards to the basins of the Amur River and the Ussuri River at about 49°N. The southern race is restricted to Madagascar, and a small population of purple herons on the Cape Verde Islands is regarded as a separate race by some authorities.

Between August and October, birds of the western population migrate southwards to tropical Africa, returning northwards in March. Purple herons often overshoot their normal range on their return, and are vagrants to northern Europe including Britain. The eastern population is largely resident, though some birds from the northern part of the range fly southwards to Korea, Thailand and Malaysia. The African birds are resident.

The purple heron inhabits marshes, lagoons and lakes surrounded by dense vegetation. It may frequent mangrove swamps on the coast but it usually chooses freshwater habitats, particularly locations with &quot;Phragmites&quot; reed beds. It also visits mudflats, river banks, ditches and canals. In the Cape Verde Islands, it is more likely to be seen in the open, on arid slopes.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Flight is slow, with the neck retracted and the legs extending a long way behind the tail. This is characteristic of herons and bitterns, and distinguishes them from storks, cranes and spoonbills, which extend their necks in flight. It is a secretive bird, spending less time out in the open than the grey heron and tending to skulk in reed beds. Its long toes mean it can walk on floating vegetation, and it sometimes walks over bushes in the same way, not making any attempt to grip the branches. It seldom perches in trees, preferring more terrestrial sites to rest.

It is most active at dawn and dusk, roosting with other birds in the middle of the day and at night, but increasing its diurnal activity while rearing young. It feeds in shallow water, grabbing its prey with its powerful beak. It will often wait motionless for prey, or slowly stalk its victim. The diet consists mainly of fish, small mammals and amphibians, but nestling birds, snakes, lizards, crustaceans, water snails, insects and spiders are also eaten. Terrestrial beetles are the commonest insect prey, followed by water beetles and aquatic larvae, with grasshoppers, dragonflies, bees and flies also being consumed.

The purple heron usually breeds in colonies but sometimes the nests are solitary. It sometimes associates with other species such as the goliath heron (&quot;Ardea goliath&quot;) or grey heron at multi-species nesting colonies. The site chosen is generally in reed beds, canebrakes or low bushes close to large lakes or other extensive wetlands. It builds a bulky nest of dead reeds, sticks or whatever is available, carelessly pulling the material together. The eggs are bluish-green, averaging . The clutch is usually four or five eggs, with occasionally seven or eight eggs being laid, though these large clutches may have resulted from two females laying in the same nest. The eggs are laid at intervals of three days, and incubation may begin with the first egg, or start when the clutch is complete. Both parents share the incubation, which lasts between 24 and 28 days, and the care of the young. When an adult brings food, its beak is dragged down by the chicks and it regurgitates food from the crop onto the nest, or the young may take food directly from the beak. The young fledge at about six weeks and become independent at two months. They then disperse widely.

==Status==

The global purple heron population was estimated to comprise 180,000 to 380,000 individuals as of 2019, and the population is probably decreasing; it has therefore been assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The chief threat is drainage and disturbance of wetland habitats, particularly destruction of reed beds. The purple heron is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Dušan Code (, known historically as – Law of the pious Emperor Stefan) is a compilation of several legal systems that was enacted by Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia in 1349. It drew upon Roman law, Byzantine law, as well as elements of customary and canon law. It was used in the Serbian Empire and the succeeding Serbian Despotate. It is considered an early constitution, or close to it; an advanced set of laws which regulated all aspects of life such as family relations, property rights, contracts, and crimes.

==Background==

On 16 April 1346 (Easter), Dušan convoked a huge assembly at Skopje, attended by the Serbian Archbishop Joanikije II, the Archbishop of Ochrid Nikolaj I, the Bulgarian Patriarch Simeon and various religious leaders of Mount Athos. The assembly and clerics agreed on, and then ceremonially performed the raising of the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the status of Serbian Patriarchate. The Archbishop from then on was titled Serbian Patriarch, although one document called him &quot;Patriarch of Serbs and Greeks&quot;, with the seat at the Monastery of Peć. The first Serbian Patriarch Joanikije II now solemnly crowned Dušan as &quot;Emperor and autocrat of Serbs and Romans&quot; (Greek ).

==History==
The Code was promulgated at a state council on 21 May 1349 in Skopje, the capital of the Serbian Empire. The foreword is as follows: &quot;We enact this Law by our Orthodox Synod, by His Holiness the Patriarch Kir Joanikije together with all the Archbishops and Clergy, small and great, and by me, the true-believing Emperor Stefan, and all the Lords, small and great, of this our Empire&quot;. In the Charter, which accompanied the Code, it said: &quot;It is my desire to enact certain virtues and truest of laws of the Orthodox faith to be adhered to and observed&quot;. Emperor Dušan added a series of articles to it in 1353 or 1354, at a council in Serres. This second part was half the size and at times cited issues from the first part, referring it to the &quot;first Code&quot;.

It had a total of 201 articles. Four of them (79, 123, 152, 153), regarding various subjects, refers to the authority of the &quot;Law of the Sainted King&quot; (i.e. Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia, r. 1282–1321, Dušan&#x27;s grandfather), which suggests that Milutin had issued a code whose text has not survived. Dušan&#x27;s Code was thus a supplement to Milutin Code, as well as a supplement to the various Church law codes that also had authority in Serbia; in particular the Nomocanon of Saint Sava (&quot;Zakonopravilo&quot;), enacted in 1219 with the establishment of the Serbian Orthodox Church and Serbian Kingdom. The &quot;Syntagma Canonum&quot;, written in 1335 by Matthew Blastares, had been translated into Serbian and had received legal authority by 1349, and its articles had influenced the text of the Code. Dušan&#x27;s Code was heavily influenced by Byzantine law – nearly half of its articles reflect some influence, often modified for Serbia. The code had many articles concerning the Church, which reflects Byzantine Church law; Byzantine civil law codes, especially the late-9th-century compilation by Basil I and Leo VI, also influenced the code. Scholars A. Solovjev and Soulis conclude that the Council of 1349 issued a three-part comprehensive legal document, since most early manuscripts of the Code also contain two other texts: The first part was an abridgement of the Syntagma, the second part was the so-called &quot;Code of Justinian&quot; (a short compilation of Byzantine legal rules, mostly taken from the Farmer&#x27;s Law, not to be confused with the Code that is part of the Corpus Juris Civilis), and the third part was always Dušan Code itself.
According to Fine, there is a possibility that the Code was written to supplement the first two parts, by adding items that were not covered, rather than to build a comprehensive legal system.

==Composition==
The first part, the Syntagma, was an encyclopedic legal collection, provided in alphabetical order. It drew from religious and secular law; ecclesiastical articles made up a majority of the Byzantine original. The version of Dušan&#x27;s manuscripts contained only a third of the original Greek version; it omitted most of the ecclesiastical material and contained mainly secular articles; Serbia already had an ecclesiastical code in Saint Sava Nomocanon. The secular articles of the abridged Serbian version of the Syntagma were drawn chiefly from Basil I&#x27;s law code and the Novella&#x27;s of Emperors who succeeded him; they focused on laws governing contracts, loans, inheritance, marriage, dowries etc. as well as on matters of criminal law. The second part, the Law of Justinian, was actually a shortened version of the 8th-century Farmer&#x27;s Law, a code settling problems and disputes among peasants within a village.

The third part, Dušan Code, added what was not covered in the other two parts and specific Serbian situations. Since aspects of civil and criminal law were well covered in the two parts, Dušan&#x27;s articles concerned with public law and legal procedures. The Code also provided more material on actual punishments; in which there is a strong Byzantine influence, with executions and mutilations frequently replacing Serbia&#x27;s traditional fines. It touched on crimes or insults and their punishment; settlement of civil suits (including ordeals and selection and role of juries); court procedure and judicial jurisdictions (defining which cases to be judged by which bodies among Church courts, the Emperor&#x27;s court, courts of the Emperor&#x27;s circuit judges, and judgement by a nobleman); and rights and obligations, including the right to freely carry out commerce (articles 120, 121), tax obligations (summary tax and timeframe to pay), grazing rights and their violation, service obligations to the Emperor, exemption from state dues (usually for the Church), obligations associated with land, and the obligation of the Church to perform charity. 

The code also defined the different types of landholding (specifying the various rights and obligations that went with various categories of land), the rights of inheritance, the position of slaves, and the position of serfs. It defined the labor dues serfs owed to their lords (article 68) but also gave them the right to lay plaint against their master before the Emperor&#x27;s court (article 139). The code also noted the special privileges of foreign communities (e.g. the &quot;Saxons&quot;).

Many articles regarded the Church status, thus supplementing the existing canon law texts. The Church received a very privileged position, on the whole, though it was given the duty of charity in no uncertain terms: &quot;And in all churches the poor shall be fed ... and should any one fail to feed them, be he Metropolitan, bishop, or abbot, he shall be deprived of his office&quot; (article 28). The code also banned simony. A clear-cut separation of Church and state was established in most matters, allowing Church courts to judge the Church&#x27;s people and prohibiting the nobility from interfering with Church property and Church matters. 

Dušan Code did not look favorably upon the Catholic Church, though he, as his predecessors, was friendly and respectable to foreign Catholics (Saxons and coastal merchants). He referred to the Roman Catholic Church as the &quot;Latin heresy&quot; and to its adherents as &quot;half believers.&quot; He prohibited proselytism by Catholics among the Orthodox, Orthodox conversions to Catholicism, and mixed marriages between Catholics and Orthodox unless the Catholic converted to Orthodoxy. He also had articles strongly penalizing &quot;heretics&quot; (Bogomils). Only the Orthodox were called Christians.

The code defined and allowed court procedure, jurisdictions, and punishment to depend upon the social class of the individual involved, supporting the existing class structure. Articles touched on the status in society and in court of clergy, nobility, commoners, serfs, slaves, Albanians and Vlachs (the latter two for their pastoralist lifestyle, than for ethnic reasons), and foreigners. The Code also guaranteed the authority and income of the state; it contained articles on taxes, obligations associated with land, and services and hospitality owed to the Emperor and his agents. Greek, &quot;Latin&quot; or Italian, Ragusan, Bulgarian, Vlach, Albanian and Serbian merchants can freely trade without interference and in transit they are free to transfer their goods. 
The Code also maintained law and order, not limiting itself against crime and insults, but also gave responsibility to specific communities; it stated the existing custom that each territory was responsible and liable for keeping order; e.g. a frontier lord was responsible for defending his border: &quot;if any foreign army come and ravish the land of the Emperor, and again return through their land, those frontier lords shall pay all [the people] through whose territory they [the army] came.&quot; (Article 49). The control of brigands, a constant problem in the Balkans, was also widely addressed in articles 126, 145, 146, 158 and 191. Article 145 says: &quot;In whatsoever village a thief or brigand be found, that village shall be scattered and the brigand shall be hanged forthwith ... and the headmen of the village shall be brought before me [the Emperor] and shall pay for all the brigand or thief hath done from the beginning and shall be punished as a thief and a brigand.&quot; and continues in article 146, &quot;also prefects and lieutenants and bailiffs and reeves and headmen who administer villages and mountain hamlets. All these shall be punished in the manner written above [article 145] if any thief or brigand be found in them.&quot; And article 126 states, &quot;lf there be a robbery or theft on urban land around a town, let the neighborhood pay for it all.&quot; And finally article 158 requires that the localities bordering on an uninhabited hill jointly supervise that region and pay for damage from any robbery occurring there. Fine concludes that these articles demonstrate a weakness in the state&#x27;s maintaining of order in rural and border areas, which caused it to pass responsibility down to local inhabitants, by threatening them with penalties, the state hoped to force the locality to assume this duty. Another reason for the strictness of the articles towards the locality was the belief that the brigand could not survive without local support, shelter, and food. Thus the brigand was seen as a local figure, locally supported, preying on strangers. As a result, the allegedly supporting locality shared his guilt and deserved to share the punishment. The strict articles were therefore intended to discourage a community from aiding brigands.

The monarch had wide autocratic powers, but was surrounded and advised by a permanent council of magnates and prelates. The court, chancellery and administration were rough copies of those of Constantinople. The Code named the administrative hierarchy as following: &quot;lands, cities, župas and krajištes&quot;, the župas and krajištes were one and the same, with the župas on the borders were called krajištes (&quot;frontier march&quot;). The župa consisted of villages, and their status, rights and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent &quot;sebri&quot;, the equivalent of Greek &quot;paroikoi&quot;; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree. The earlier title of &quot;župan&quot; was abolished and replaced with the Greek &quot;kephale&quot; (&quot;kefalija&quot;, &quot;head, master&quot;).

The legal transplanting is notable with the articles 171 and 172, which regulated juridical independence, taken from &quot;Basilika&quot; (book VII, 1, 16–17).

===Peasants===

Dušan Code is one of few sources on the position of Serbia&#x27;s peasants.
One aspect is the treatment of the position and rights of Serbia&#x27;s peasants. In the context of the medieval social structure, peasants were the commoners who engaged in agricultural work and formed a substantial part of the population. Commoners, who were the peasants, were not allowed to form or participate in any council. Those found to be involved in any council-related activities were subjected to severe punishment. The code prescribes that the punishment for participating in a council would be cutting off the offender&#x27;s ears, while the leaders or organizers of such councils would be subjected to singeing.

==Legacy==

The code continued as the constitution under the rule of Dušan&#x27;s son, Stefan Uroš V, and during the fall of the Serbian Empire, it was used in all provinces. It was officially used in the successor state, Serbian Despotate, until its annexation by the Ottoman Empire in 1459. The code was used as a reference for Serbian communities under Turkish rule, which exercised considerable legal autonomy in civil cases. The code was used in the Serbian autonomical areas under the Republic of Venice, like Grbalj and Paštrovići.

Noel Malcolm has argued that an article in Dušan Code can be considered speculatively as an early attempt to clamp down on the self-administered Albanian customary law of the mountains (Kanun), and if so, this would be an early evidence that such customary laws were in effect. 

Dušan Code regulated all social spheres, thus it is considered the second oldest preserved constitution of Serbia. The original manuscript is not preserved, but around twenty copies of the transcript, ranging from the 14th to the 18th century, remain.

==Manuscripts==
 The Popović family from Dvorane, which generated 18 or 21 generations of village priests, were important in the preservation of medieval Serbian literature: they had the Charter of Our Lady of Ljeviš, written by Serbian King Stefan Dečanski (r. 1321–1331), in their direct property; the Russian consul in Prizren, Jastrebov, found it at the house of the last descendant of the family, Jovan Dvoranac Popović in Prizren, who gave it to the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. It is believed that one of the forefathers of the family was the &quot;elder&quot; of the Saint Archangels Monastery (Dušan&#x27;s endowment) near Prizren, and that he during the Ottoman times managed to transfer the valuable texts to the church in his village of Dvorane. In 1779, priest Partenije Popović became a monk of the Saint Mark Koriški Monastery, to where he brought several important books. In 1859, Prizren teacher Nikola Musulin found the Dušan&#x27;s Code there, and in 1860 the Saint Archangels Charter was found in the St. Nicholas Church in the village of Koriša.

Today 24 manuscripts of Dusan Code are known. The oldest extant is the Struga manuscript from 1373; which is not preserved in full; only 100 articles remain. The Athos and Studenica manuscripts date from around 1418. The Hilandar, Bistrica and Prizren manuscripts, which have the most complete texts, date to the 15th century. The Rakovac manuscript, dating to around 1700, comprises only the last 12 articles and the Emperor&#x27;s comments.

<doc id="238209" wikidata="Q863394" url="?curid=238209" title="Biltong">
<text>Biltong is a form of air-dried, cured meat which originated in South Africa, and from there spread to other Southern African countries -- (Zimbabwe, Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, and Zambia). Various types of meat are used to produce it, ranging from beef to game meats such as ostrich or kudu. The cut may also vary being either fillets of meat cut into strips following the grain of the muscle, or flat pieces sliced across the grain. It is related to beef jerky, as both are spiced, dried meats; however, the typical ingredients, taste, and production processes may differ. Biltong is air-dried, which gives it a unique texture and flavor, whereas jerky is heated to at least .

The word &quot;biltong&quot; is from the Afrikaans (&quot;buttock&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;strip&quot; or &quot;tongue&quot;).

== Origins ==
Meat preservation as a survival technique dates back to ancient times. 

Meat can be preserved by curing it in salt, brine, or vinegar as well as saltpetre (potassium nitrate). Potassium nitrate kills &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;, the deadly bacterium that causes botulism, while the acidity of vinegar inhibits its growth. According to the World Health Organization, &quot;C. botulinum&quot; will not grow in acidic conditions (pH less than 4.6), and so the toxin will not be formed in acidic foods. 

The antimicrobial properties of certain spices have also been drawn upon since ancient times. The spices introduced to biltong by the Dutch include pepper, coriander, and cloves.

According to local lore, biltong was originally made in the 17th century by Dutch pioneers who would place large strips of raw meat under horses&#x27; saddles to dry with the horses&#x27; salty sweat. This salty sweat preserved the meat while also tenderizing it from the shocks of riding. This &quot;drying&quot; process helped to provide a reliable and rich source of protein that would keep for months. Others speculate that the early Dutch settlers simply adopted a local custom of preserving meat. This is unlikely, however, as the use of horses did not begin until the colonization of South Africa.

In January 2017, a research group at the University of Beira Interior in Portugal published a study about the antimicrobial properties of coriander oil (coriander being one of the main spices in the most basic of biltong recipes) against 12 bacterial strains, and found that 10 of the 12 strains of bacteria were killed with a relatively mild concentration of coriander oil (1.6%). In the two strains which were not effectively killed, &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot; and &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;, the coriander oil reduced their growth significantly.

The need for food preservation in Southern Africa was pressing. Iceboxes and refrigerators had not been invented yet, and building up herds of livestock took a long time. With game in abundance in Southern Africa, however, traditional methods were called upon to preserve the meat of large African animals including the eland. 

The meat was prepared with vinegar and spices then hung to be air dried for a fortnight during the winter, when the colder temperatures further inhibited bacterial and fungal growth. Once suitably dried, the biltong was ready for packing in cloth bags which allowed air circulation to help prevent mold.

== Ingredients ==
The most common ingredients of biltong are:
* Meat
* Black pepper
* Coriander
* Salt
* Vinegar

Modern-day ingredients sometimes include balsamic vinegar or malt vinegar, sugar, dry ground chilli peppers, nutmeg, paprika, lemon juice, garlic, bicarb soda, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and saltpetre.

== Meat ==
Prior to the introduction of refrigeration, the curing process was used to preserve all kinds of meat in Southern Africa, but biltong is most commonly made today from beef, primarily because of its widespread availability and lower cost relative to game. For the finest cuts, fillet, sirloin, or steaks cut from the hip, such as topside or silverside, are used. Other cuts can be used, but are not as high in quality.

Biltong can also be made from:
* Chicken, simply referred to as chicken biltong
* Fish in this case, known as &quot;bokkoms&quot; (shark biltong can also be found in South Africa). &quot;Bokkoms&quot; should not be confused with other cured fish such as dried angelfish and dried snoek.
* Game such as kudu, springbok, and wildebeest
* Ostrich meat (bright red, often resembling game)
* Venison meat (used in Europe resembling game)

== Preparation ==
Traditionally, biltong was only made during the cold of winter when the risk of bacterial growth and mould would be at a minimum. Some recipes require the meat to be marinated in a vinegar solution (grape vinegar is traditional but balsamic and cider also work very well) for a few hours, then the vinegar is poured off before the meat is flavoured with salt and spices. The spice mix is sprinkled liberally over the meat and rubbed in. Saltpetre is optional and can be added as an extra preservative (necessary only for wet biltong that is not going to be frozen). The meat should then be left for a further few hours (or refrigerated overnight) and any excess liquid poured off before the meat is hung in the dryer.

Other recipes, which were handed down from generation to generation, require the biltong to be left overnight in the vinegar, salt, and spice solution (between 12 and 24 hours). The spice mix traditionally consists of equal amounts of rock salt, whole coriander (slightly roasted), roughly ground black pepper, and brown sugar. The vinegar serves as a primary inhibitor of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; bacteria, according to the World Health Organization, while the salt, coriander, pepper, and cloves all have antimicrobial properties.

== Drying ==

Biltong is always an air-dried meat. When heat is added, it is called &#x27;jerky.&#x27;

Traditionally, biltong was made during the cold winters of the South African highveld for best results. The cold, dry air typically dried out the biltong much more effectively, and in the best possible food safety environment. Mould and bacterial risk are at a natural minimum, and thicker biltong cuts can be hung to dry slowly for a richer texture, fuller flavour, and darker colour. 

Heat has only been introduced into the process in recent years by sellers who erroneously still call it &#x27;biltong&#x27;, however, it is not authentic biltong and traditional biltong makers maintain that heat makes for an inferior end result.

== Comparison with jerky ==
Biltong differs from jerky in four distinct ways:

* Biltong is air-dried over days, whereas jerky is heated to at least .
* Since jerky is heat-dried, the process is much faster than for making biltong. 
* The meat used in biltong is often much thicker due to the faster drying time in dry air conditions; typically, biltong meat is cut in strips around wide, but can be thicker. Jerky is normally very thin meat.
* The vinegar, salt, and spices in biltong, together with the drying process, cure the meat as well as adding texture and flavour. Jerky is traditionally dried with salt, but without vinegar.
* Jerky is often smoked; biltong is rarely smoked.
*Biltong normally does not contain any sugar additives, while jerky usually does.

== Retail ==
Biltong is a common product in Southern African butcheries and grocery stores, and can be bought in the form of wide strips or much thinner strips (known as , meaning &quot;little sticks&quot;). It is also sold in plastic bags, sometimes shrink-wrapped, and may be either finely shredded or sliced as biltong chips.

Also, some specialised retailers sell biltong. These shops may sell biltong as &quot;wet&quot; (moist), &quot;medium&quot;, or &quot;dry&quot;. Additionally, some customers prefer it with a lot of fat, while others prefer it as lean as possible.

== Eating ==
While biltong is usually eaten as a snack, it can also be diced up into stews, or added to muffins or pot bread. Biltong-flavoured potato crisps have also been produced, and some cheese spreads have biltong flavour. Finely shredded biltong is eaten on slices of bread and in sandwiches.

Biltong can be used as a teething aid for babies.

Biltong is a high-protein food. Often, 200 g of beef is required to make 100 g of biltong, and the process of making biltong preserves most of the protein content. Some biltong can have up to 67% protein content.

== Worldwide ==
Biltong&#x27;s popularity has spread to many other countries with large South African populations, who often regard it with pride as a defining national food - Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United States, and India. Biltong is also produced within South African expatriate communities across the globe, for example in Germany, Ireland, and even South Korea.

Biltong produced in South Africa may not be imported into Britain, according to rules governing the importation of meat-based products from non-EU countries laid down by HM Customs and Excise and its successor HM Revenue and Customs, thus it is made in the UK.

In the United States, biltong is relatively rare, as beef jerky has been traditionally the more popular dried meat snack. Within the last few years, biltong has begun a small emergence within the United States, particularly from South African immigrants who have brought their local culture and foods with them. Due to concerns related to the presence of foot-and-mouth disease in South Africa, the United States Department of Agriculture requires a meat inspection certificate issued by a South African government authority to accompany imports of biltong.

<text>Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion, and thought, which could possibly be understood as a mental disorder. Although many behaviors could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology typically deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, functionally, morally, or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by &quot;abnormal&quot;. There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind–body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are , and .

The science of abnormal psychology studies two types of behaviors: adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. Behaviors that are maladaptive suggest that some problem(s) exist, and can also imply that the individual is vulnerable and cannot cope with environmental stress, which is leading them to have problems functioning in daily life in their emotions, mental thinking, physical actions and talks. Behaviors that are adaptive are ones that are well-suited to the nature of people, their lifestyles and surroundings, and to the people that they communicate with, allowing them to understand each other.

Clinical psychology is the applied field of psychology that seeks to assess, understand, and treat psychological conditions in clinical practice. The theoretical field known as &quot;abnormal psychology&quot; may form a backdrop to such work, but clinical psychologists in the current field are unlikely to use the term &quot;abnormal&quot; in reference to their practice. Psychopathology is a similar term to abnormal psychology, but may have more of an implication of an underlying pathology (disease process), which assumes the medical model of mental disturbance and as such, is a term more commonly used in the medical specialty known as psychiatry.

==History==
=== Humors ===

Hippocrates (460–377 BCE) hypothesized that the body and mind become unwell when the so-called humors, vital fluids in the body, become unbalanced. The four temperaments theory posits four such humors: black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. Each humor was associated with a particular temperament: too much phlegm causes a person to be fatigued, too much black bile causes melancholia, yellow bile causes a quick temper, and too much blood causes optimism, cheerfulness, and confidence.

===Asylums===
The act of placing individuals with mental illness in a separate facility known as an asylum dates to 1547, when King Henry VIII of England established the St. Mary of Bethlehem asylum in London. This hospital, nicknamed Bedlam, was famous for its deplorable conditions. Asylums remained popular throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance era. These early asylums often had miserable conditions. Patients were seen as a &quot;burden&quot; to society, locked away and treated almost like beasts to be dealt with, rather than patients needing treatment. However, many of the patients received helpful medical treatment. There was scientific curiosity into abnormal behavior, although it was rarely investigated in the early asylums. Inmates in these early asylums were often put on display for profit, as they were viewed as less than human. The early asylums were basically modifications of the existing criminal institutions.

In the late 18th century, the idea of humanitarian treatment for the patients gained much favor, due to the work of Philippe Pinel in France. He pushed for the idea that the patients should be treated with kindness, and not the cruelty inflicted on them, as if they were animals or criminals. His experimental ideas, such as removing the chains from the patients, were met with reluctance. The experiments in kindness proved to be a great success, which helped to bring about a reform in the way mental institutions would be run.

Institutionalization would continue to improve throughout the 19th and 20th century, as a result of the work of many humanitarians such as Dorothea Dix, and the mental hygiene movement which promoted the physical well-being of the mental patients. &quot;Dix, more than any other figure in the nineteenth century, made people in America and virtually all of Europe aware that the insane were being subjected to incredible abuses.&quot; Through this movement, millions of dollars were raised to build new institutions to house the mentally ill. Mental hospitals began to grow substantially in numbers during the 20th century, as care for the mentally ill increased in them.

By 1939, there were over 400,000 patients in state mental hospitals in the US. Hospital stays were normally quite long for the patients, with some individuals being treated for many years. These hospitals, while better than the asylums of the past, were still lacking in the means of effective treatment for the patients. Even though the reform movement had occurred, patients were often still met with cruel and inhumane treatment.

Things began to change in the year 1946, when Mary Jane Ward published the influential novel titled &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, which was made into a popular movie of the same name. The book called attention to the conditions which mental patients faced, and helped to spark concern in the general public to create more humane mental health care in these overcrowded hospitals.

That same year, the National Institute of Mental Health was also created, which provided support for the training of hospital employees, and research into the conditions of the patients. During this period, the Hill-Burton Acts was also passed, which was a program that funded mental health hospitals. Along with the Community Health Services Act of 1963, the Hill-Burton Acts helped with the creation of outpatient psychiatric clinics, inpatient general hospitals, and rehabilitation and community consultation centers.

=== Deinstitutionalisation ===
In the late twentieth century, however, a large number of mental hospitals were closed in many countries. In England, for example, only 14 of the 130 psychiatric institutions that had been created in the early 20th century remained open at the start of the 21st century. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy launched the community health movement in the United States as a &quot;bold new approach&quot; to mental health care, aimed at coordinating mental health services for citizens in mental health centers. In the span of 40 years, the United States was able to see an about 90 percent drop in the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals.

Deinstitutionalisation ended the long-term confinement of patients in isolating mental hospitals, which could and did cause long-term negative adaptations. For instance, institutionalizing people with schizophrenia worsens negative symptoms. However, the practice is sometimes criticised for a perceived rise in homelessness amongst people who were previously institutionalized, or are presumed that they would have been in the institution era.

==Explaining abnormal behaviour==

People have tried to explain and control abnormal behavior for thousands of years. Historically, there have been three main approaches to abnormal behavior: the supernatural, biological, and psychological traditions. Abnormal psychology revolves around two major paradigms for explaining mental disorders, the &quot;psychological&quot; paradigm and the &quot;biological&quot; paradigm. The psychological paradigm focuses more on the humanistic, cognitive, and behavioral causes and effects of psychopathology. The biological paradigm includes theories that focus more on physical factors, such as genetics and neurochemistry.
===Supernatural explanations===
In the first supernatural tradition, also called the demonological method, abnormal behaviors are attributed to agents outside human bodies. According to this model, abnormal behaviors are caused by demons, aliens, or spirits, or the influences of the Moon, planets, and stars. During the Stone Age, trepanning was performed on those who had mental illness, to literally cut the evil spirits out of the victim&#x27;s head. Conversely, Ancient Chinese, Ancient Egyptians, and Hebrews believed that these were evil demons or spirits and advocated exorcism. By the time of the Greeks and Romans, mental illnesses were thought to be caused by an imbalance of the four humors which lead treatments like the draining of fluids from the brain. During the Medieval period, many Europeans believed that the power of witches, demons, and spirits caused abnormal behaviors. People with psychological disorders were thought to be possessed by evil spirits that had to be exorcised through religious rituals. If exorcism failed, some authorities advocated steps such as confinement, beating, and other types of torture to make the body uninhabitable to witches, demons, and spirits. The belief that witches, demons, and spirits are responsible for the abnormal behavior continued into the 15th century. Swiss alchemist, astrologer, and physician Paracelsus (1493–1541), on the other hand, rejected the idea that abnormal behaviors were caused by witches, demons, and spirits and suggested that people&#x27;s mind and behaviors were influenced by the movements of the moon and stars. This tradition is still alive today. Some people, especially in the developing countries, as well as some followers of religious sects in the developed countries, continue to believe that supernatural powers influence human behaviors. In Western academia, the supernatural tradition has been largely replaced by the biological and psychological traditions.

===Supernatural traditions===

Throughout time, societies have proposed several explanations of abnormal behavior within human beings. Beginning in some hunter-gatherer societies, animists have believed that people demonstrating abnormal behavior are possessed by malevolent spirits. This idea has been associated with trepanation, the practice of cutting a hole into the individual&#x27;s skull in order to release the malevolent spirits. Although it has been difficult to define abnormal psychology, one definition includes characteristics such as statistical infrequency.

A more formalized response to spiritual beliefs about abnormality is the practice of exorcism. Performed by religious authorities, exorcism is thought of as another way to release evil spirits who cause pathological behavior within the person. In some instances, individuals exhibiting unusual thoughts or behaviors have been exiled from society, or worse. Perceived witchcraft, for example, has been punished by death. Two Catholic Inquisitors wrote the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (Latin for &quot;The Hammer Against Witches&quot;), which was used by many Inquisitors and witch-hunters. It contained an early taxonomy of perceived deviant behavior, and proposed guidelines for prosecuting deviant individuals.

===Biological explanations===
In the biological tradition, psychological disorders are attributed to biological causes. In the psychological tradition, disorders are attributed to faulty psychological development, and to social context. The medical or biological perspective holds the belief that most or all abnormal behavior can be attributed to a medical factor; assuming all psychological disorders are diseases.

The Greek physician Hippocrates, who is considered to be the father of Western medicine, played a major role in the biological tradition. Hippocrates and his associates wrote the Hippocratic Corpus between 450 and 350 BC, in which they suggested that abnormal behaviors can be treated like any other disease. Hippocrates viewed the brain as the seat of consciousness, emotion, intelligence, and wisdom and believed that disorders involving these functions would logically be located in the brain.

These ideas of Hippocrates and his associates were later adopted by Galen, the Roman physician. Galen extended these ideas and developed a strong and influential school of thought within the biological tradition that extended well into the 18th century.

Kendra Cherry, MSEd, states: &quot;The medical approach to abnormal psychology focuses on the biological causes of mental illness. This perspective emphasizes understanding the underlying cause of disorders, which might include genetic inheritance, related physical disorders, infections, and chemical imbalances. Medical treatments are often pharmacological in nature, although medication is often used in conjunction with some other type of psychotherapy.&quot;

===Psychological explanations===

According to Sigmund Freud&#x27;s structural model, the id, ego, and superego are three theoretical constructs that define the way an individual interacts with the external world, as well as responding to internal forces The Id represents the instinctual drives of an individual that remain unconscious. The super-ego represents a person&#x27;s conscience and their internalization of societal norms and morality. Finally, the ego serves to realistically integrate the drives of the id with the prohibitions of the super-ego. Lack of development in the Superego, or an incoherently developed Superego within an individual, will result in thoughts and actions that are irrational and abnormal, contrary to the norms and beliefs of society.

====Irrational beliefs====
Irrational beliefs are driven by unconscious fears and can result in abnormal behavior. Rational emotive behavior therapy helps to drive irrational and maladaptive beliefs out of one&#x27;s mind.

==== Sociocultural influences====
The term sociocultural refers to the various circles of influence on the individual, ranging from close friends and family, to the institutions and policies of a country, or the world as a whole. Discriminations, whether based on social class, income, race and ethnicity, or gender, can influence the development of abnormal behaviour.

===Multiple causality===
The number of different theoretical perspectives in the field of psychological abnormality has made it difficult to properly explain psychopathology. The attempt to explain all mental disorders with the same theory leads to reductionism (explaining a disorder or other complex phenomena using only a single idea or perspective). Most mental disorders are composed of several factors, which is why one must take into account several theoretical perspectives, when attempting to diagnose or explain a particular behavioral abnormality or mental disorder. Explaining mental disorders with a combination of theoretical perspectives is known as multiple causality.

The diathesis–stress model emphasizes the importance of applying multiple causality to psychopathology, by stressing that disorders are caused by both precipitating causes, and predisposing causes. A precipitating cause is an immediate trigger that instigates a person&#x27;s action or behavior. A predisposing cause is an underlying factor that interacts with the immediate factors to result in a disorder. Both causes play a key role in the development of a psychological disorder. For example, high neuroticism antedates most types of psychopathology.

===Recent concepts of abnormality===
* &quot;Statistical abnormality&quot; – when a certain behavior/characteristic is relevant to a low percentage of the population. However, this does not necessarily mean that such individuals have mental illness (for example, statistical abnormalities such as extreme wealth/attractiveness)
* &quot;Psychometric abnormality&quot; – Psychometric abnormality implicates abnormality as a deviation from a statistically determined norm, such as the population average IQ of 100. In this case, an IQ score less than about 70–75 may define someone as having a learning disability, and suggests they will have some difficulties coping with life. However, the problems associated with a low IQ differ widely across individuals depending on their life circumstances. So, even when an individual is defined as psycho-metrically &#x27;abnormal&#x27;, this tells us little about their actual condition or problems. Furthermore, if one takes the other end of the IQ spectrum, a deviation of 30 points above the mean is generally not considered to be abnormal, or to indicate the presence of mental health problems.
* &quot;Deviant behavior&quot; – this is not always a sign of mental illness, as mental illness can occur without deviant behavior, and such behavior may occur in the absence of mental illness.
* &quot;Combinations&quot; – including distress, dysfunction, distorted psychological processes, inappropriate responses in given situations, and causing/risking harm to oneself.

==== Examples ====
There is a wide range of mental disorders that are considered to be forms of Abnormal Psychology. These include, but are not limited to:

===== Schizophrenia =====

Schizophrenia can be described as a disorder that causes extreme loss of touch with reality. The Psychotic nature of schizophrenia manifests itself through delusions, as well as auditory and visual hallucinations. Schizophrenia is known to have a genetic etiology, as well as other biological components, such as brain disruptions in the prenatal development period.

===== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder =====

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by high amounts of inattention and hyperactive impulsiveness. Inattentive symptoms include not listening, careless errors, disorganization, losing personal belongings, becoming easily distracted, and forgetfulness. Symptoms of hyperactive impulsiveness include fidgeting, talking excessively, and interrupting others.

===== Antisocial personality disorder =====

Antisocial personality disorder can be described as a cluster of personality traits that lead to specific outcomes, and violate the rights of other people. These personality traits include callousness, deceitfulness, lack of remorse, apathy, manipulation of others, impulsiveness, and grandiosity. Additional traits may include superficial charm, sexual promiscuity, and pathological lying.

===== Dissociative identity disorder =====

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) involves one individual having multiple personalities. Those with DID are described as having multiple selves that each have their own consciousness and awareness.

DID has two main etiologies, which are the post-traumatic and socio-cognitive models. The post-traumatic model states that DID is caused by inescapable past trauma, such as child abuse. The child dissociates and forms alternate personalities as a coping mechanism, in response to the current trauma. Even when the trauma ends, the personalities continue to disrupt the person&#x27;s life longterm. The socio-cognitive model states that people will implicitly act as if they have multiple personalities and that it is done to align with cultural norms.

===== Social anxiety disorder =====

Those with social anxiety disorder (SAD) have a very intense fear of social situations. This fear stems from the belief that the person will be evaluated negatively or embarrass themselves.

SAD is also considered to be one of the more disabling mental disorders. Symptoms of this disorder include fear in most, if not all, social situations. SAD can develop after a traumatic and/or embarrassing experience has occurred while the person was being observed by other people.

===== Generalized anxiety disorder =====

Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by a constant, chronic state of worry and anxiety that is related to a large variety of situations, and is difficult to control. Additional symptoms may include irritability, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and restlessness.

===== Specific phobia =====

Individuals with specific phobias have an extreme fear and avoidance of various objects or situations. Specifically, fears become phobias when there is excessive and unreasonable fear that is disproportionate to the culture that the individual is in. Examples of specific phobias include, but are not limited to, phobias of school, blood, injury, needles, small animals, and heights.

===== Post-traumatic stress disorder =====

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is described as physical and mental distress related to past traumatic experiences. PTSD can manifest a large variety of symptoms, including, but not limited to, nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance and/or physiological reactions related to stimuli regarding the trauma, shame, guilt, anger, hypervigilance, and social withdrawal.

PTSD symptoms can arise due to various experiences that involve actual or threatened violence, injury, or death. Firsthand experience, witnessing, or learning about traumatic experiences can possibly lead to the development of PTSD.

==Approaches==
* &quot;Somatogenic&quot; – abnormality is seen as a result of biological disorders in the brain. This approach has led to the development of radical biological treatments, e.g. lobotomy.
* &quot;Psychogenic&quot; – abnormality is caused by psychological problems. Psychoanalytic (Freud), Cathartic, Hypnotic and Humanistic Psychology (Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow) treatments were all derived from this paradigm. This approach has, as well, led to some esoteric treatments: Franz Mesmer used to place his patients in a darkened room with music playing, then enter it wearing a flamboyant outfit and poke the &quot;infected&quot; body areas with a stick.

==Classification==

===DSM-5===
The DSM-5 is the manual where most commonly discussed and researched information about this particular topic of abnormalities is included. There are various conditions that have been included in this manual and continue to be added to the DSM-5. The causes of many of these diseases are derived from variables such as genetic, biological, socio-cultural, systemic, and biopsychosocial factors. There are also various counseling theories that support and help explain the findings related to each illness. In North America this is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. The current version of the book is known as the DSM-5. It lists a set of disorders and provides detailed descriptions on what constitutes a mental disorder.

The DSM-5 identifies three key elements that must be present to constitute a mental disorder. These elements include:
* Symptoms that involve disturbances in behavior, thoughts, or emotions.
* Symptoms associated with personal distress or impairment.
* Symptoms that stem from internal dysfunctions (i.e. specifically having biological and/or psychological roots). 
The DSM-5 uses three main sections to organize its contents. These sections include I, II, and III. Section I includes the introduction, use, and basics of the DSM-5. Section II includes diagnostic criteria and codes. Section III includes emerging measures and models.

=== Section I (DSM-5 basics) ===
Section I of the DSM-5 briefly prefaces purpose, content, structure, and use. This includes basics, introductions and cautionary statements for forensic use. Information is also given about the revision and review processes as well as the DSM-5&#x27;s goals to harmonize with the ICD-11. An explanation regarding the change from the previous multi-axial classification system to the current three section system is also included here.

=== Section II (Diagnostic criteria and codes) ===
Section II of the DSM-5 Contains a wide range of diagnostic criteria and codes used for establishing, and diagnosing the vast amount of abnormal psychological constructs. This sections replaced the bulk of the axis system in the previous DSM versions and includes the following categories:

* Diagnostic Criteria and codes
* Neurodevelopmental Disorders
* Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
* Bipolar and related Disorders
* Depressive Disorders
* Anxiety Disorders
* Obsessive-Compulsive and related Disorders
* Trauma and Stressor related disorders
* Dissociative Disorders
* Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders
* Feeding and Eating Disorders
* Elimination Disorders
* Sleep Wake Disorders
* Sexual Dysfunctions
* Gender Dysphoria
* Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders
* Substance Related and Addictive Disorders
* Neurocognitive Disorders
* Personality Disorders
* Paraphilic Disorders
* Medication induced movement disorders and effects of medication.
* Other Mental disorders and additional Codes

These categories are used to organize the various Abnormal psychological concepts based on their similarity.

=== Section III (Emerging measures and models) ===
Section III of the DSM-5 contains the various methods and strategies that are used to make clinical decisions, understand culture, and explore emerging diagnoses. 

===ICD-10===
The major international nosologic system for the classification of mental disorders can be found in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). The ICD-10 has been used by World Health Organization (WHO) Member States since 1994. Chapter five covers some 300 mental and behavioral disorders. The ICD-10&#x27;s chapter five has been influenced by APA&#x27;s DSM-IV and there is a great deal of concordance between the two. Beginning in January 2022, the ICD-11 will replace the ICD-10 in WHO member states. WHO maintains free access to the ICD-10 Online. Below are the main categories of disorders:
* F00–F09 Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders
* F10–F19 Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use
* F20–F29 Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders
* F30–F39 Mood [affective] disorders
* F40–F48 Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders
* F50–F59 Behavioral syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors
* F60–F69 Disorders of adult personality and behavior
* F70–F79 Intellectual Disability 
* F80–F89 Disorders of psychological development
* F90–F98 Behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence
* F99 Unspecified mental disorder

=== ICD-11 ===
The ICD-11 is the most recent version of the International Classification of Diseases. The &quot;Mental, behavioral, or Neurodevelopmental disorders section&quot; highlights forms of abnormal psychology.

Mental, behavioral, or neurodevelopmental disorders

* 6A00-6A0Z Neurodevelopmental disorders
* 6A20-6A2Z Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders
* 6A40-6A4Z Catatonia

* 6B00-6B0Z Anxiety or fear related disorders
* 6B20-6B2Z Obsessive-compulsive or related disorders
* 6B40-6B4Z Disorders specifically associated with stress
* 6B60-6B6Z Dissociative disorders
* 6B80-6B8Z Feeding or eating disorders

* 6E40.0-6E40.Z (6E40) Psychological or behavioral factors affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere
* 6E60-6E6Z secondary mental or behavioral syndromes associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere

==Perspectives of abnormal psychology==
Psychologists may use different perspectives to try to get better understanding on abnormal psychology. Some of them may just concentrate on a single perspective. But the professionals prefer to combine two or three perspectives together in order to get significant information for better treatments.
*Behavioral – the perspective focus on observable behaviors
*Medical – the perspective focus on biological causes on mental illness
*Cognitive – the perspective focus on how internal thoughts, perceptions and reasoning contribute to psychological disorders

==Cause==

===Genetics===
* Investigated through family studies, mainly of monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins, often in the context of adoption. Monozygotic twins should be more likely than dizygotic twins to have the same disorder because they share 100% of their genetic material, whereas dizygotic twins share only 50%. For many disorders, this is exactly what research shows. But given that monozygotic twins share 100% of their genetic material, it may be expected of them to have the same disorders 100% of the time, but in fact they have the same disorders only about 50% of the time
* These studies allow calculation of a &quot;heritability coefficient&quot;.
*Genetic vulnerabilities (Diathesis stress Model)

===Biological causal factors===
* Neurotransmitter [imbalances of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and GABA (Gamma aminobutyric acid)] and hormonal imbalances in the brain
* Constitutional liabilities [physical handicaps and temperament]
* Brain dysfunction and neural plasticity
* Physical deprivation or disruption [deprivation of basic physiological needs]

===Socio-cultural factors===
* Effects of urban/rural dwelling, gender and minority status on state of mind
*Generalizations about cultural practices and beliefs may fail to capture the diversity that exists within and across cultural groups, so we must be extremely careful not to stereotype individuals of any cultural group
* Experiences with child physical and or sexual abuse.
* Encounters with environments that involve actual or threatened death

===Systemic factors===
* Family systems
* Negatively Expressed Emotion playing a part in schizophrenic relapse and anorexia nervosa.

===Biopsychosocial factors===
* Illness dependent on stress &quot;triggers&quot;.

==Therapies==
===Psychoanalysis (Freud)===
Psychoanalytic theory is heavily based on the theory of the neurologist Sigmund Freud. These ideas often represented repressed emotions and memories from a patient&#x27;s childhood within their unconscious. According to psychoanalytic theory, these repressions cause the disturbances that people experience in their daily lives, and by finding the source of these disturbances, one should be able to eliminate the disturbance itself. This is accomplished by a variety of methods, with some popular ones being free association, hypnosis, and insight. The goal of these methods is to induce a catharsis, or emotional release in the patient, which should indicate that the source of the problem has been tapped, and it can then be treated. Freud&#x27;s psychosexual stages also played a key role in this form of therapy, as he would often believe that the problems the patient was experiencing were due to them becoming stuck, or &quot;fixated&quot;, in a particular stage. Dreams also played a major role in this form of therapy, as Freud viewed dreams as a way to gain insight into the unconscious mind. Patients were often asked to keep dream journals to bring in for discussion during the next therapy session. There are many potential problems associated with this style of therapy, including resistance to the repressed memory or feeling, and negative transference onto the therapist. Psychoanalysis was carried on by many after Freud, including his daughter Anna Freud, and Jacques Lacan. Many others have also gone on to elaborate on Freud&#x27;s original theory, and to add their own take on defense mechanisms or dream analysis. While psychoanalysis has fallen out of favor to more modern forms of therapy, it is still used by some clinical psychologists to varying degrees.

===Behavioral therapy (Wolpe)===
Behavior therapy relies on the principles of behaviorism, such as involving classical and operant conditioning. Behaviorism arose in the early 20th century, from the work of psychologists such as James Watson and B. F. Skinner. Behaviorism states that all behaviors humans do is because of a stimulus and reinforcement. While this reinforcement is normally for good behavior, it can also occur for maladaptive behavior. In this therapeutic view, the patients maladaptive behavior has been reinforced, which will cause the maladaptive behavior to be repeated. The goal of the therapy is to reinforce less maladaptive behaviors, so that with time, these adaptive behaviors will become the primary ones in the patient.

===Humanistic therapy (Rogers)===

Humanistic therapy aims to achieve self-actualization (Carl Rogers, 1961). In this style of therapy, the therapist will focus on the patient themselves, as opposed to the patient&#x27;s problem. The goal of this therapy is, by treating the patient as &quot;human&quot;, rather than &quot;client&quot;, to get to the source of the problem, and to resolve the problem in an effective manner. Humanistic therapy has been on the rise in recent years, and has been associated with numerous positive benefits. It is considered to be one of the core elements needed for therapeutic effectiveness, and a significant contributor to not only the well-being of the patient, but society as a whole. Some say that all of the therapeutic approaches today draw from the humanistic approach in some regard, and that humanistic therapy is the best way for treat a patient. Humanistic therapy can be used on people of all ages; it is very popular among children in its variant known as &quot;play therapy&quot;.

===Cognitive behavioural therapy (Ellis and Beck)===

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to influence thought and cognition (Beck, 1977). This form of therapy relies on not only the components of behavioral therapy as mentioned before, but also the elements of cognitive psychology. This relies on not only the clients behavioral problems that could have arisen from conditioning, but also their negative schemas and distorted perceptions of the world around them. These negative schemas may cause distress in the life of the patient; for example, the schemas may give them unrealistic expectations for how well they should perform at their job, or how they should look physically. When these expectations are not met, it will often result in maladaptive behaviors, such as depression, obsessive compulsions, and anxiety. With CBT, the goal is to change the schemas that are causing the stress in the patients life, and replace them with more realistic ones. Once the negative schemas have been replaced, it will hopefully cause a remission of the patients symptoms. CBT is considered particularly effective in the treatment of depression, and has even been used in recent years in group settings. It is felt that using CBT in a group setting aids in giving its members a sense of support, and decreasing the likelihood of them dropping out of therapy before the treatment has had time to work properly. CBT has been found to be an effective treatment for many patients, even those who do not have diseases and disorders typically thought of as psychiatric ones. For example, patients with the disease multiple sclerosis have found a lot of help using CBT. The treatment often helps the patients cope with the disorder they have, and how they can adapt to their new lives without developing new problems, such as depression, or negative schemas about themselves.

According to RAND, therapies are difficult to provide to all patients in need. A lack of funding and understanding of symptoms provides a major roadblock that is not easily avoided. Individual symptoms and responses to treatments vary, which creates a disconnect between patient, society, and care givers/professionals.

===Play therapy (Humanistic)===

Children are often sent to therapy due to outbursts that they have in a school or home setting; the theory is that by treating the child in a setting that is similar to the area that they are having their disruptive behavior, the child will be more likely to learn from the therapy, and have an effective outcome. In play therapy, the clinicians will &quot;play&quot; with their client, usually with toys, or a tea party. Playing is the typical behavior of a child, and therefore, playing with the therapist will come as a natural response to the child. In playing together, the clinician will ask the patient questions, and due to the setting, the questions seem less intrusive, more therapeutic, and more like a normal conversation. This should help the patient realize issues they have, and confess them to the therapist with less difficulty than they may experience in a traditional counselling setting.

Play therapy involves a therapist observing a child as the child plays with toys and interacts with their surrounding environment. The therapist plays an observational, as well as an interactional role, in the intervention. This process allows for the child to enact their problems through play, and speak more comfortably with the therapist. Although somewhat controversial, due to data that suggests a lack of effectiveness in children older than 10 years old, play therapy has been shown to be a valuable treatment. This therapy is particularly useful for younger children under the age of 10, who are consciously aware of their environment. Play therapy is important, seeing as many therapeutic interventions that are effective for adults have shown to be less effective for children.

===Family systems therapies===

Family systems therapies are based on the belief that children&#x27;s problems revolve around problems that occur within the family. Family systems therapy attempts to improve the relations between multiple people involved in specific families via therapeutic intervention. For the best effect, it is recommended that the entire family be included in the therapy. The treatments include family management skill development, and child–parent attachment development. These interventions help to improve family functioning.

===Family management skill development (Family systems therapy)===

Family management skills can be taught by family therapists, and include methods such as improving supervision, disciplinary practices, and creating environments that allow for positive interactions between parents and children.

=== Child–parent attachment development (Family systems therapy) ===

Child–parent attachment development involves altering or creating relationships between parents and children, in attempts to create secure bases for the child, and to facilitate trust, independence, and positive perceptions of family relationships. We see these situations a lot more than we think which makes some spectrums of abnormal psychology more normal, and more common. These goals are often achieved by creating understanding regarding behaviors, creating opportunities for attachment, and increasing the family&#x27;s ability to think about their history and relationships.

=== Stigmatization and negative connotations ===

One of the primary criticisms of the term &quot;Abnormal Psychology&quot; is its contribution to the stigmatization of individuals with mental health conditions. The label &quot;abnormal&quot; implies a deviation from a societal norm, which can reinforce negative stereotypes and social exclusion. Critics argue that such language can lead to individuals feeling marginalized, perpetuating a sense of &quot;otherness&quot; and reinforcing the stigma associated with mental health issues.

<text>Wu Jingheng (), commonly known by his courtesy name Wu Zhihui (Woo Chih-hui, ; 1865–1953), also known as Wu Shi-Fee, was a Chinese linguist and philosopher who was the chairman of the 1912–13 Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation that created Zhuyin (based on Zhang Binglin&#x27;s work) and standardized Guoyu pronunciation.

Wu became an anarchist during his stay in France in the first decade of the 20th century, along with Li Shizeng, Zhang Renjie, and Cai Yuanpei. With them, he was known as one of the strongly anti-communist &quot;Four Elders&quot; of the Nationalist Party in the 1920s.

==Career==
Born into a poor family in Wujin, Jiangsu province as Wu Tiao (), Wu Zhihui was an outstanding student, passing the challenging Juren examination in 1891.

He served at the Nanyang College Preparatory School Hall (now the Shanghai Nanyang Model High School). In 1903 in the &quot;Subao&quot; newspaper, Wu criticized the Qing government and derided then ruling Empress Dowager Cixi as a &quot;withered old hag&quot; and a &quot;whore.&quot;

After this incident, Wu fled by way of Hong Kong to London. His official status enabled him to travel and live in Scotland and France. He attended university lectures in Edinburgh. In 1903, he went to Paris, where he renewed his friendship with Li Shizeng, the son of a high official he had met in Beijing, and with Zhang Renjie, well-connected son of a prosperous merchant. Although Wu was their elder by more than a decade, the three young scholars, although well-versed in the Confucian philosophy which dominated Chinese thought, were impressed by the doctrines of anarchism which flourished in France. Together with Li and Zhang, he formed the &quot;Shijie She&quot; (World Society), which became a center of anarchist thought and recruitment for several decades.

Together they joined the Tongmenghui, the precursor to the Chinese Nationalist Party (GMD), in 1905. Wu declared himself an anarchist the next year. He later founded influential revolutionary organizations like the Society to Advance Morality and supervised radical journals like New Era and Labor, China&#x27;s first syndicalist magazine. He promoted science, rationalism, language reform, and the abolition of marriage. His ideas were revolutionary, but he estimated that it would take 3,000 years to achieve his vision of a utopian society. Wu was instrumental in the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement in France. Among his students were a large group of anarchists – and future communists.

==Return to China and allegiance to Kuomintang==

Soon after their return in 1912, Wu, Li, Zhang Ji, and Wang Jingwei organized The Society to Advance Morality (Jinde hui, ), also known as the &quot;Eight Nots,&quot; or &quot;Eight Prohibitions Society (八不會 Babu hui). Wu felt that the new Republic must not be menaced by the social decadence of the late Qing, evils which ranged from mah-jong and stag parties to taking second wives. True to its anarchist principles, there was no president or officers, no regulations or means to enforce them, and no dues or fines. Each level of membership, however, had increasingly rigorous requirements. &quot;Supporting members,&quot; the lowest level, agreed not to visit prostitutes and not to gamble. &quot;General members&quot; agreed in addition not to take concubines. The next higher level further agreed not to become government officials — &quot;Someone has to watch over officials&quot; — not to become members of parliament, and not to smoke. Finally, the highest level also promised to abstain from alcohol and meat.

While declining to hold office, Wu did accept Cai Yuanpei&#x27;s offer join the commission on language reform, beginning work on a phonetic system for writing which would replace regional dialects. This work eventually resulted in the Guoyu Zhuyin fuhao system which is widely used today. In June 1913, Wu was one of the founders of the journal &quot;Public Opinion&quot; () When in 1913 Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Second Revolution failed, Wu and Li Shizeng for safety returned to France. Li and Wu founded the University of Lyon-France and launched the Work-Study movement.

In the 1920s, along with Li Shizeng, Zhan Renjie, and Cai Yuanpei, was one of the so-called &quot;Four Elders&quot; of the GMD and led the anti-communist campaign which drove leftists and communists from the party and supported Chiang Kai-shek. In accordance with his anarchist principles, Wu Zhihui declined any government office.

In 1943, National Government Chairman Lin Sen died in provisional wartime capital of Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek inviting Wu to be the new president, but Wu declined, citing &quot;three no&#x27;s&quot;: 
* I usually wear very casual clothes, but the heads of state wear tuxedos. I would feel uncomfortable.
* My ugly face, like a big shock.
* My people love to laugh. To see something funny makes me laugh, When foreign diplomats deliver credentials, I could not help but laugh. This would not be decent.

In 1946, Wu was elected to the National Assembly, which drew up a new constitution. He administered the oath of office to Chiang Kai-shek in May 1948, shortly before the government left the mainland for Taiwan.
He moved to Taiwan and was the teacher of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s son, Chiang Ching-kuo. He died in Taipei at the age of 88. Chiang Ching-kuo carried out Wu&#x27;s directive that his ashes be lowered into the sea off the island of Quemoy.

<text>Letters patent (plural form for singular and plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations, government offices, to grant city status or coats of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom, they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm.

A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern intellectual property patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention or design. In this case, it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it both to avoid infringement (while the patent remains in force) and to understand how to put it into practical use (once the patent rights expire). In the Holy Roman Empire, Austrian Empire, and Austria-Hungary, imperial patent was also the highest form of generally binding legal regulations, e.g. Patent of Toleration, Serfdom Patent, etc.

The opposite of letters patent are &quot;letters close&quot; (), which are personal in nature and sealed so that only the recipient can read their contents. Letters patent are thus comparable to other kinds of open letter in that their audience is wide. It is not clear how the contents of letters patent became widely published before collection by the addressee, for example whether they were left after sealing by the king for inspection during a certain period by courtiers in a royal palace, who would disseminate the contents back to the gentry in the shires through normal conversation and social intercourse. Today, for example, it is a convention for the British prime minister to announce that they have left a document they wish to enter the public domain &quot;in the library of the House of Commons&quot;, where it may be freely perused by all members of parliament.

==Meaning==
Letters patent are so named from the Latin verb &#x27;, &#x27;, to lie open, exposed, accessible. The originator&#x27;s seal was attached &quot;pendent&quot; from the document, so that it did not have to be broken in order for the document to be read.

They are called &quot;letters&quot; (plural) from their Latin name &quot;&quot;, used by medieval and later scribes when the documents were written in Latin. This loanword preserves the collective plural &quot;letters&quot; (&quot;litterae&quot;) that the Latin language uses to denote a message as opposed to a single alphabet letter (&quot;littera&quot;).

==Usage==
Letters patent are a form of open or public proclamation and a vestigial exercise of extra-parliamentary power by a monarch or president.

They can thus be contrasted with the Act of Parliament, which is in effect a written order by Parliament involving assent by the monarch in conjunction with its members. No explicit government approval is contained within letters patent, only the seal or signature of the monarch.

Parliament today tolerates only a very narrow exercise of the royal prerogative by issuance of letters patent, and such documents are issued with prior informal government approval, or indeed are now generated by government itself with the monarch&#x27;s seal affixed as a mere formality. In their original form they were simply written instructions or orders from the sovereign, whose order was law, which were made public to reinforce their effect.

For the sake of good governance, it is of little use if the sovereign appoints a person to a position of authority but does not at the same time inform those over whom such authority is to be exercised of the validity of the appointment.

According to the United Kingdom Ministry of Justice, there are 92 different types of letters patent. The Patent Rolls are made up of office copies of English (and later United Kingdom) royal letters patent, which run in an almost unbroken series from 1201 to the present day, with most of those to 1625 having been published.

==United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms==
In the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms, letters patent are royal proclamations granting an office, right, title, or status to a person (and sometimes in regard to corporations and cities). Letters patent take the form of an open letter from the monarch to a subject, although this is a legal fiction and they are in fact a royal decree made under the royal prerogative and are treated as statute law. Letters patent do not require the consent of parliament.

Specific usage in Commonwealth realms outside the United Kingdom include:
* Creation of vice-regal offices, for example in Canada in 1947 and New Zealand in 1983.
* Creation of Royal Commissions or Special Commissions of Inquiry, such as in Australia.

==United States==
The primary source of letters patent in the United States are intellectual property patents and land patents, though letters patent are issued for a variety of other purposes. They function dually as public records and personal certificates.

In the United States, the forgery of letters patent granted by the President is a crime subject to fine, imprisonment up to ten years or both (). Without letters patent, a person is unable to assume an appointed office. Such an issue prompted the &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; suit, where William Marbury and three others petitioned the United States Supreme Court to order James Madison to deliver their letters for appointments made under the previous administration.

===Form of United States letters patent===
United States letters patent generally do not fit a specific form, except for the eschatocol, or formal ending:

<doc id="238220" wikidata="Q208492" url="?curid=238220" title="Sulidae">
<text>The bird family Sulidae comprises the gannets and boobies. Collectively called sulids, they are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish and similar prey. The 10 species in this family are often considered congeneric in older sources, placing all in the genus &quot;Sula&quot;. However, &quot;Sula&quot; (true boobies) and &quot;Morus&quot; (gannets) can be readily distinguished by morphological, behavioral, and DNA sequence characters. Abbott&#x27;s booby (&quot;Papasula&quot;) is given its own genus, as it stands apart from both in these respects. It appears to be a distinct and ancient lineage, maybe closer to the gannets than to the true boobies.

==Description==
Sulids measure about in length and have a wingspan around . They have long, narrow, and pointed wings, and a quite long, graduated, and rather lozenge-shaped tail whose outer feathers are shorter than the central ones. Their flight muscles are rather small to allow for the small cross-section required for plunge-diving, as an adaptive trade-off relative to some sacrifice in flight performance. Consequently, they are very streamlined, reducing drag, so their bodies are &quot;torpedo-shaped&quot; and somewhat flat.

They have stout legs and webbed feet, with the web connecting all four toes. In some species, the webs are brightly colored and used in courtship displays. The bill is usually conspicuously colored, long, deep at the base, and pointed, with saw-like edges. The upper mandible curves down slightly at the tip and can be moved upward to accept large prey. To keep water out during plunges, the nostrils enter into the bill rather than opening to the outside directly. The eyes are angled forward, and provide a wider field of binocular vision than in most other birds.

Their plumage is either all-white (or light brownish or greyish) with dark wingtips and (usually) tail, or at least some dark brown or black above with white underparts; gannets have a yellowish hue to their heads. The face usually has some sort of black markings, typically on the lores. Unlike their relatives (the darters and cormorants), sulids have a well-developed preen gland whose waxy secretions they spread on their feathers for waterproofing and pest control. They moult their tail feathers irregularly and the flight feathers of their wings in stages, so that starting at the first moult, they always have some old feathers, some new ones, and some partly grown ones. Moult as a response to periods of stress has been recorded.

==Distribution and ecology==
The sulids are distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical waters, but they, particularly gannets, are found in temperate regions, too. These birds are not truly pelagic seabirds like the related Procellariiformes, and usually stay rather close to the coasts, but the abundant colonies of sulids that exist on many Pacific islands suggest that they are not infrequently blown away from their home range by storms, and can wander for long distances in search of a safe place to land if need be.

All species feed entirely at sea, mostly on mid-sized fish and similarly sized marine invertebrates (e.g. cephalopods). Many species feed communally, and some species follow fishing boats to scavenge discarded bycatch and chum. The typical hunting behavior is a dive from midair, taking the bird a 1–2 m under water. If prey manages to escape the diving birds at first, they may give chase using their legs and wings for underwater swimming.

As noted above, the behavioral traits of gannets and boobies differ considerably, but the Sulidae as a whole are characterized by several behavioral synapomorphies: Before taking off, they point their bills upwards (gannets) or forward (boobies). After landing again, they point downwards with their bills. In response to a threat, they do not attack, but shake their heads and point their bills towards the intruders.

===Reproduction===

All sulids breed in colonies. Males examine the colony area in flight and then pick a nest site, which they defend by fighting and territorial displays. Males then advertise to females by a special display and call. Their display behavior is characteristic, though not as diverse as the numerous variations found among the cormorants; it typically includes the male shaking his head. Females search the colony in flight and on foot for a mate. Once they select males, pairs maintain their bonds by preening each other and by frequent copulation.

The clutch is typically two eggs. The eggs are unmarked (but may become stained by debris in the nest), whitish, pale blue, green, or pink, and have a coating that resembles lime. Egg weight ranges from 3.3 to 8.0% of the female&#x27;s weight. Incubation lasts 42 to 55 days, depending on the species. Both sexes incubate; like their relatives, they do not have brood patches, but their feet become vascularized and hot, and the birds place the eggs under the webs. Eggs lost during the first half of incubation are replaced.

At hatching, parents move the eggs and then the hatchlings to the tops of their webs. The young hatch naked, but soon develop white down. They beg by touching the parent&#x27;s bill and take regurgitated food straight from its gape. At first, at least one parent is always in attendance of the altricial young; after two weeks, both parents leave the nest unguarded at times while they go fishing. The times for the chicks to fledge and become independent of their parents depend greatly on the food supply. Rarely does more than one chick survive to maturity, except in the Peruvian booby (&quot;Sula variegata&quot;), which has the biggest clutch (two to four eggs), and less often in the blue-footed booby (&quot;S. nebouxii&quot;). Siblicide by the stronger of two chicks is frequent.

==Systematics and evolution==

Sulids are related to a number of other aquatic birds, which all lack external nostrils and a brood patch, but have all four toes webbed and a gular sac. The closest living relatives of the Sulidae are the Phalacrocoracidae (cormorants and shags) and the Anhingidae (darters). The latter are somewhat intermediate between sulids and cormorants, but (like many cormorants) they are freshwater birds in a clade containing otherwise seabirds, and also symplesiomorphic with sulids but synapomorphic with cormorants in some other respects. Thus, the Sulidae seem to be the oldest and most distinct lineage of those three, which are united in a suborder Sulae. Therein, the Sulidae are typically placed simply as a family; sometimes, a superfamily Suloidea is recognized, wherein some of the primitive prehistoric forms (e.g. &quot;Empheresula&quot;, &quot;Eostega&quot;, and &quot;Masillastega&quot;) are placed as basal lineages distinct from the living Sulidae. However, the proposed family Pseudosulidae (or Enkurosulidae) is almost certainly invalid.

The Sulae were traditionally included in the Pelecaniformes in its obsolete paraphyletic circumscription, but pelicans, the namesake family of the Pelecaniformes, are actually more closely related to herons, ibises and spoonbills, the hamerkop, and the shoebill than to the sulids and allies. In recognition of this, the Sulae have been proposed for separation in a new order Phalacrocoraciformes, which also includes the frigatebirds (Fregatidae), as well as one or more prehistoric lineages that are entirely extinct today. The IOC World Bird List uses Suliformes as the proposed order name.

Within the family itself, three living genera—&quot;Sula&quot; (boobies, six species), &quot;Papasula&quot; (Abbott&#x27;s booby), and &quot;Morus&quot; (gannets, three species)—are recognized. A 2011 study of multiple genes found Abbott&#x27;s booby to be basal to all other gannets and boobies, and likely to have diverged from them around 22 million years ago, and the ancestors of the gannets and remaining boobies split around 17 million years ago. The most recent common ancestor of all boobies lived in the late Miocene around 6 million years ago, after which time the boobies steadily diverged. The gannets split more recently, only around 2.5 million years ago.

The fossil record of sulids is quite extensive due to the many Miocene/Pliocene forms that have been recovered, but the lineage of sulids extends back to the Eocene, and all things (such as the Early Eocene frigatebird &quot;Limnofregata&quot;) considered, the sulids seem to have diverged from the lineage leading to cormorants and darters around 50 million years ago (Mya), perhaps a bit earlier. The initial evolutionary radiation formed a number of genera that are now completely extinct, such as the freshwater &quot;Masillastega&quot; (which, as noted above, might not have been a modern-type sulid) or the bizarre &quot;Rhamphastosula&quot; (which had a bill shaped like an aracari&#x27;s). The modern genera evolved (like many other living genera of birds) around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary about 23 Mya. &quot;Microsula&quot;, which lived during that time, seems to have been a primitive booby that still had many symplesiomorphies with gannets. Like the other Phalacrocoraciformes, the sulids originated probably in the general region of the Atlantic or western Tethys Sea – probably the latter rather than the former, given that their earliest fossils are abundant in Europe, but absent from the well-studied contemporary American deposits.

Prehistoric sulids (or suloids) only known from fossils are:
* &quot;Masillastega&quot; (Early Eocene of Messel, Germany) – may belong in &quot;Eostega&quot;
* &quot;Eostega&quot; (Late Eocene of Cluj-Manastur, Romania) – may include &quot;Masillastega&quot;
* Sulidae gen. et sp. indet. (Thalberg Late Oligocene of Germany) – &quot;Empheresula&quot;?
* Sulidae gen. et sp. indet. (Late Oligocene of South Carolina, United States) – &quot;Microsula&quot;?
* &quot;Empheresula&quot; (Late Oligocene of Gannat, France – Middle Miocene of Steinheimer Becken, Germany) – including &quot;&quot;Sula&quot; arvernensis&quot;, &quot;Parasula&quot;
* &quot;Microsula&quot; (Late Oligocene of South Carolina, United States – Grund Middle Miocene of Austria) – may belong in &quot;Morus&quot; or &quot;Sula&quot;, includes &quot;&quot;Sula&quot; avita&quot;, &quot;&quot;S.&quot; pygmaea&quot;, &quot;Enkurosula&quot;, &quot;Pseudosula&quot;
* &quot;Sarmatosula&quot; (Middle Miocene of Credinţa, Romania)
* &quot;Miosula&quot; (Late Miocene of California)
* &quot;Paleosula&quot; (Early Pliocene? of California)
* &quot;Rhamphastosula&quot; (Pisco Early Pliocene of SC Peru)
* &quot;Bimbisula&quot; (middle Pliocene of South Carolina)
* Sulidae gen. et sp. indet. (Late Pliocene of Valle di Fine, Italy) – &quot;Morus&quot;?

For prehistoric species of the extant genera, see the genus articles.

The Early Oligocene &quot;Prophalacrocorax ronzoni&quot; of Ronzon, France, was variously placed in the seaduck genus &quot;Mergus&quot;, in &quot;Sula&quot;, and after a distinct genus was established for it, in the Phalacrocoracidae. While it is quite likely to belong in the Sulae and may have been an ancient sulid (or suloid), of the three placements explicitly proposed, none seems to be correct.

<text>A promenade dance or promenade, commonly called a prom, is a dance party for high school students. It may be offered in semi-formal black tie or informal suit for boys, and evening gowns for girls. This event is typically held at or near the end of the school year. There may be individual junior (11th grade) and senior (12th grade) proms or they may be combined.

At a prom, a &quot;Prom King&quot; and a &quot;Prom Queen&quot; may be revealed. These are honorary titles awarded to students elected in a school-wide vote prior to the prom. Other students may be honored with inclusion in a &quot;prom court&quot;. The selection method for a prom court is similar to that of homecoming queen/princess, king/prince, and court. Inclusion in a prom court may be a reflection of popularity of those students elected and their level of participation in school activities, such as clubs or sports.
The prom queen and prom king may be given crowns to wear. Members of the prom court may be given sashes to wear and photographed together.

Similar events, which may be locally inspired by debutante balls, take place in many other parts of the world. In Canada, the terms &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;Grad&quot; are often used, while in Australia and New Zealand, the terms school formal and ball are most commonly used for occasions equivalent to the American prom, and the event is usually held for students in Year 12. Many schools hold a formal graduation ball for finishing students at the end of the year in place of or as well as a formal. In Ireland, a &quot;debutante ball&quot; or debs may also be held. In Poland and Lithuania, high schools organize a &quot;studniówka&quot; (lt. &quot;Šimtadienis&quot;). The term &quot;prom&quot; has become more common in the United Kingdom and Canada because of the influence of American films and television shows, such as &quot;Grease&quot;. In South Africa, this event is widely known as a matric dance / matric farewell as students in their 12th year of school are called matric students. In South Asia, its equivalent is a farewell party.

Variation exists between different dialects with regard to whether &quot;prom&quot; is used with the definite article or not—e.g., whether one says &quot;go &quot;to the&quot; prom&quot; or &quot;go &quot;to&quot; prom&quot;.

==In the United States==
===History===

In the early days of high school proms, the nighttime dance served a function similar to a debutante ball. Early proms were times of firsts: the first adult social event for teenagers; the first time taking the family car out after dark; the first real dress-up affair; and so forth. Proms also served as a heavily documented occasion, similar to a milestone event such as first communion or a wedding, in which the participants were taking an important step into a new stage in their lives. In earlier days, the prom may have also served as an announcement of engagement for the &#x27;best couple&#x27; after the prom court had been crowned and recognized.

While high school yearbooks did not start covering proms and including prom pictures until the 1930s and 1940s, historians, including Meghan Bretz, believe proms may have existed at colleges as early as the late 19th century. The journal of a male student at Amherst College in 1894 recounts an invitation and trip to an early prom at neighboring Smith College for women. The word &quot;prom&quot; at that time may have been a fancy description for an ordinary junior or senior class dance, but prom soon took on larger-than-life meaning for high school students.

Proms worked their way down incrementally from college gatherings to high school extravaganzas. In the early 20th century, prom was a simple tea dance where high school seniors wore their Sunday best. In the 1920s and 1930s, prom expanded into an annual class banquet where students wore party clothes and danced afterward. As Americans gained more money and leisure time in the 1950s, proms became more extravagant and elaborate, bearing similarity to today&#x27;s proms. The high school gym may have been an acceptable setting for sophomore dances, but junior prom and senior balls gradually moved to hotel ballrooms and country clubs. Competition blossomed, as teens strove to have the best dress, the best mode of transportation, and the best-looking date. Competition for the prom court also intensified, as the designation of prom queen became an important distinction of popularity. Prom became the pinnacle event of a high school student&#x27;s social life.

Today, prom continues to be a notable event in the social climate of high schools. Popular movies and novels attest to the importance of prom themes, prom dates, and prom queens. In some areas, the traditions of prom are not as rigid as they used to be, with many students attending as individuals or in groups instead of as couples. In 1975, U.S. First Daughter Susan Ford held her prom in the East Room of the White House.

===Attire===
Traditionally, boys dress in black or white formal wear, often tuxedos regardless of the time of the event, sometimes paired with ties or bow ties with vests or cummerbunds, in some cases in colors matching their date&#x27;s dress.

Traditionally, girls wear dresses or evening gowns and adorn themselves with ladies&#x27; jewelry such as earrings and a necklace. Traditionally, girls wear perfume and make-up such as eyeshadow, lipstick, mascara, and blush. Girls also traditionally wear a corsage, given to them by their dates, and girls give boys matching boutonnières to be worn on their lapels.

By the 2000s, the clothes girls wear to prom have become more revealing due to the influence of celebrities and the mass media.

===Promposals===
A &quot;promposal&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;prom&quot; and &quot;proposal&quot;) is a popular pre-prom tradition where a student asks another to go to the prom with them using some (usually elaborate) method and extra fanfare. A promposal is distinct from the normal prom ask, which typically includes the question, &quot;Will you go to prom with me?&quot; without additional spectacle. Promposals may include concepts and materials from posters, confetti, and balloons to the more viral, elaborate plans that give promposals their extravagant reputation. Examples include spelling &quot;Prom?&quot; with pepperoni on pizza, organizing a flash mob, graffitiing national park land, and using a hot-air balloon. Promposals, due to their flashy nature, often include a social media aspect like livestreaming, taking and posting videos, and other forms of memorializing on social media platforms.

===Champagne Parties===

Champagne parties, also known as &quot;send-offs,&quot; have become a prominent pre-prom tradition in the United States. These celebrations typically take place before high school proms and serve as elaborate gatherings that precede the formal prom event. The concept of champagne parties gained significant attention due to their flamboyant nature and the remarkable cultural custom they represent.

Originating in the 2010s, champagne parties are characterized by their extravagance, creativity, and community involvement. Families host these events to celebrate and honor their teenagers as they prepare to depart for their proms. The festivities often include live music, themed decorations, red carpet entrances, and communal gatherings where friends, family, and neighbors come together to celebrate the youth&#x27;s journey into adulthood. Attire at champagne parties typically mirrors the elegance and formality of prom attire, with teenagers and sometimes even their guests donning stylish evening gowns, suits, and formalwear.

===Logistics and traditions===

Prom attendees may be limited by their schools to be juniors or seniors and guests under age 21. Before prom, girls typically get their hair styled, often in groups as a social activity at a salon. Prom couples then gather at a park, garden, or their own and their dates&#x27; houses for single and group photographs. Prom attendees may rent limousines or party buses to transport groups of friends from their homes to the prom venue. Some schools host their proms at hotel ballrooms, banquet halls, or other venues where weddings typically take place. The dance itself may have a band or DJ. At prom, a meal may be served. By the early 21st century, prom has become a multi-billion-dollar business in the United States, with each family spending hundreds to even thousands of dollars for the occasion.

Some high schools allow only the graduating class (&quot;seniors&quot;) to have a prom. Some schools also allow grade 11 (&quot;juniors&quot;) to have a prom, and in some cases, there is a combined junior/senior prom. Some American high schools that do not allow school-sponsored dances will host a junior/senior prom as a banquet instead of a dance. Typically, students still dress in formal attire and attend as couples. In recent years, American teens have started asking celebrities or famous models to their proms.

===Post-prom===
After the prom, parents or a community may host a &quot;prom after-party&quot;, &quot;afterglow&quot; or &quot;post-prom&quot; at a restaurant, entertainment venue, or a student&#x27;s home. Other traditions often include trips to nearby attractions, such as amusement parks, regional or local parks, or vacation houses. Some of these post-prom events are chaperoned and some are unsupervised. Many post-proms (after-prom events) are at the school, and involve bringing entertainment such as interactive games, artists, and other entertainers to the school, as a means to deter inappropriate behaviors.

==In the United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom prior to the 2000s, many secondary schools would hold events such as a &quot;summer ball&quot; to celebrate the end of term or a &quot;leavers ball&quot; to celebrate the end of schooling but, usually, these did not have the cultural or social significance of US-style proms.

In the 1970s, &quot;school discos&quot; had been another tradition of semi-formal events being held at various times of the year, in particular during the Christmas period, although not all secondary schools would allow such events.

During the 2000s, school proms became common at UK schools, apparently due to the influence of US TV shows. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported in 2012 that:

Schools in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland predominantly hold their prom, or &quot;school formal&quot;, at the end of secondary education in year 11 (ages 15/16) &quot;and&quot; the end of sixth form (aged 18).

In Scotland, it is usually only held at the end of S6 (ages 17/18) because all high schools in Scotland have pupils up to age 18 years, whereas elsewhere in the UK, many students have to go to college or sixth form to study for A-Levels. Proms are usually held in June, after the end of year exams, although in Northern Ireland, they are usually held in the wintertime near the start of the school year. At Scottish formal events, boys usually wear kilts (kilts are also often seen in the other Celtic regions) and Highland dress outfitters often sell out in an area around this time of year due to demand from school events. Also in Scotland, it is customary for traditional Scottish country dancing (part of the curriculum of all secondary schools) to be included.

== In Australia ==
In Australia, formals are usually held in the spring and summer months for students in Year 10 and Year 12. Some schools may also organise a formal-style event for Year 11 students, aptly named a &quot;social&quot;. These events are widely considered to be a &quot;rite of passage&quot; for students.

Traditionally the equivalent of an American prom was called a &quot;deb&quot; short for &quot;debutante ball&quot; in Australia. Later known as a &quot;formal&quot;. 

In some schools, Year 10 formals are not sanctioned or officially supported, as few students finish formal education at Year 10. However Year 12 formals are typically officially sanctioned, with the school organising the event.

==Related social gatherings elsewhere==
===Africa===
In Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana, and Tanzania most private schools with expatriates have proms or &quot;end of year socials&quot;.

==== Egypt ====
In Egypt, private schools have proms similar to ones held in the United States but with slight differences. The prom is held for a maximum of 3 hours, where teachers attend and enjoy some time with their students. Then there is the &quot;after-prom&quot;, where no teachers or parents are allowed, during that time, the real party begins with all the students dancing and enjoying their time. The after-prom can continue to 4 am and 5 am. In some places, there is no mingling of males and females due to adherence to the Islamic codes.

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, the equivalent of the American prom is the Matric Dance, taking place during the matriculation (i.e., final) year of high school (12th grade). It takes place towards the end of the third quarter, shortly before the spring break, after which the matriculation examinations commence. It usually takes the form of a formal dinner and dance. In most schools, the 11th-grade class is responsible for arranging the event. Sometimes teachers and parents also attend.

The Matric Dance has become one of the most popular occasions on the South African social calendar, but not without much controversy for its cost that, it is said, &quot;could be as much as some people&#x27;s weddings&quot;. The magazine saying this elaborates: &quot;Many parents will be torn between wanting to spoil their youngsters and wanting to resist the extravagance of handing over thousands of rands for a dress or suit that will probably only be worn once.&quot;

==== Zambia ====
In Zambia, private schools have a &quot;leavers&#x27; dance/dinner&quot; that is planned out by the grade 11 class and takes place on the Saturday after the Friday of their graduation ceremony. The dance is planned for the grade 12 class as well as the upper sixth form class and is normally done the 1st Friday after both of the classes are done writing their A-Level and IGCSE examinations. The dinner begins at 7 pm and the grade 11 class pose as the servers as well as the entertainment throughout the duration of the dinner. The dinner ends at midnight and is followed by the &quot;after-party&quot; which is celebrated at another venue (usually a club) with no parents and no teachers. Costs for renting out the venue are covered by selling tickets to outsiders and the party is usually planned by the graduating classes themselves.

===Asia===

==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, prom culture is inherited from the western countries and is generally called a ball, such as Christmas Ball. This usually takes place during Christmas and summer break. This is more popular in the secondary education stage rather than in universities. Schools, excluding international schools, holding proms are usually single-sex schools where normally the student unions in the schools will cooperate with each other in organizing the event. In recent years, more and more individual unions got united and formed different student unions associations so as to organize large-scale events including large joint-school proms. Except for those proms within the academic field, there are also adult proms for charity yearly where celebrities and government officers always go to these functions.

==== South and Central Asia ====
In India, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, the equivalent to some extent is a farewell party or farewell gathering. The outgoing students are given a warm send-off by the junior students and staff. All the seniors are felicitated with souvenirs and superlatives are given awards. There are also a couple of dances due to the influence of American culture and movies in India.

In Pakistan, there is a prom or farewell function that takes place at the end of the college academic year. Students dress in formal attire. The event ends with a photography session with the graduation.

In Afghanistan, there is a lunch party organized by the graduating students and called &quot;graduation party.&quot; This is mostly seen in the university level graduation after the 16th class with a bachelor&#x27;s degree, this day all the university seniors, faculty members, and professors are invited as honors. There is no mingling of males and females due to strict adherence to the Islamic codes.

In Bangladesh, an event called &#x27;Rag Day&#x27; is held at the end of 10th grade and 12th grade. There the school authority decorates the school and make musical arrangements. The students take celebratory preparations like making a uniform T-shirt (generally white) to commemorate the day. The juniors of the school also spend money, help organize the party and give farewell to the seniors. At the end of the party, graduating students play with powdered colors and signs on each other&#x27;s t-shirt to mark all the friendships they made in their school life.

==== Western Asia ====

In Lebanon, proms are held after the graduation ceremony at night. They are usually held at hotels with a formal dress code, prom dates, rented cars, and, occasionally, prom kings and queens. The interaction between males and females is not limited.

In Turkey, the equivalent is called Graduation Ball. The type of event and the rules applied are created by the student governments and school boards. It is a graduation tradition for seniors.

==== Southeast Asia ====
In the Philippines, proms are popular in high schools. Prom usually takes place in the junior and senior years of high school (especially grades 9 to 12), normally around February or March. Proms are commonly known as &quot;JS prom&quot;, or, junior-senior prom. Conversely, if a high school has separate dances for juniors and seniors, the term &quot;prom&quot; is reserved for the juniors, and the dance for the seniors is called a &quot;graduation ball&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;grad ball&quot; or simply &quot;ball&quot;). The associated student body generally organizes the event. Usually, a prom king and queen are chosen. The basis for the king and queen judgment is the beauty and the fashion of the nominee, not the popularity.

In Singapore, proms are held at the near end of a senior year for secondary schools or tertiary institutions. Proms are normally held after the final examinations of all senior students before graduating.

In Vietnam the equivalent to the prom is called &quot;liên hoan cuối năm&quot;. Some schools hold their liên hoan cuối năm at restaurants, but the majority of schools prefer simple &quot;tea parties&quot; with snacks and soft drinks inside their classrooms. Unlike in other countries, students don&#x27;t dress up in dresses or tuxedos; they simply wear school uniforms to the tea parties.

===Europe===
====Albania====
In Albania, &quot;mbrëmja e maturës&quot;, as graduation night, is the event held at the end of the senior year. Every school organizes it independently and the event usually takes place in June or July.

====Benelux====
In Belgium, as well as in some parts of the Netherlands, senior students celebrate their last 100 days of high school with a special day called &quot;Chrysostomos&quot; or &quot;100-dagen feest&quot; (&quot;100-days party&quot;). Tradition states that on this winter day, seniors are allowed to pull pranks on their teachers and fellow students. Some schools handle a theme as dresscode, while others go for the traditional outfit: blue jeans, a black cotton jacket, a black hat (with a red or blue ribbon), and a whistle around the neck. Some even paint their faces and some seniors also carry a spray can (shaving cream or other fluids) to &quot;attack&quot; the non-seniors with. A noisy march through town is also part of the gig. Later during the day, students perform an act at school, usually a silly show involving school or a parody. In the evening, students head to a rented club to party. This involves dancing, singing, and plenty of beer to get a taste of fraternity life. Sometimes even teachers join the party to show that they too have a wild side. In the Netherlands, households where a child who has passed their high school exams often hang the student&#x27;s backpack on a flagpole which is attached to the front of the house.

====Bulgaria====
In Bulgaria, the ball is called &quot;abiturientski bal&quot; and is held at the end of 12th grade, when you are aged 18/19. Preparations for the ball begin at the end of the 11th grade, because students are supposed to organize the whole event. It is celebrated in May, mainly on the 23rd, 24th, or 25th, after finishing exams. Students can bring a date to the event which is usually held in a restaurant or a club. Usually, before the main event there is a big gathering in front of the high school&#x27;s building, where graduates count to 12 (as in 12 grades) and take photos with each other before going to the restaurant called &quot;izprashtane&quot; (&quot;farewell send off&quot;). At the main event in the restaurant/hotel, there is music, usually pop and retro. Students are free to dance with whomever they want, even if they have come with a date. The school director and the 12th-grade teachers are also sometimes invited. There is usually an afterparty at a dance club. Some people even organize a second afterparty. After the prom night, students usually go on an excursion together for 3 to 5 days. The popular destinations are the Black Sea coast and Turkey. The event is often associated with excess in drinking and having sex.

====Czech Republic====
In the Czech Republic, the last year in &quot;Gymnasium&quot; is celebrated with &quot;maturitní ples&quot; (&quot;graduation ball&quot;). This ball takes place before exams are taken, usually in January or February, the traditional season for balls during the &quot;Fasching&quot; (e.g., List of balls in Vienna). Normally, balls are formal but modern elements are included, too. The students invite their parents, other relatives, and friends to come to the ball with them. The balls usually have a theme and the classes perform choreographed dance routines at the beginning or during the evening. The students also receive a ribbon. It&#x27;s common that various artists are invited to perform at the ball, ranging from fireshow performers to famous celebrities. At midnight, the classes perform a &quot;midnight surprise performance&quot; – typically some sort of funny act. Sometimes several schools organize a joint event. The income is often used to finance a collective voyage of the students after the exams.

====Former Yugoslavia====
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia and Serbia, &quot;maturalna večer&quot;, &quot;maturska večer&quot; or &quot;matursko veče&quot;, as graduation night, is the event held at the end of the senior year. In Croatia, it is sometimes held in January or February.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, the prom is called &quot;galla&quot; and takes place before the exams begin. The word &quot;galla&quot; refers to the dress code which is dresses for the women and suits for the men. The prom in Denmark is well known for keeping the traditional dance Les Lanciers, where the third graders of high school (the seniors) start the whole dance, then the 1st and 2nd graders join later on (the high school, called &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Denmark, is three years).

====Estonia====
In Estonia, the equivalent of the prom is often called &quot;Saja päeva ball&quot;. The event takes place 100 days prior to graduation and may be organized with several schools altogether. Students can dance but other events may be involved, too, besides ballroom dancing. The clothes are much the same kind as in the proms of other countries.

====Finland====

In Finland, the equivalent of the prom is called &quot;vanhojen tanssit&quot; (senior ball). The event is held in February when third-year high school students (the &quot;abi&quot;) end regular classes in order to prepare for their final &quot;abitur&quot; exams, and the second year students become the oldest in the school. For the remainder of the school year, the second-year students are called &quot;vanhat&quot; (&quot;the old&quot;, or &quot; the seniors&quot;).

For the ball, the second-year students learn 10–15 formal dances, mostly old ballroom dances such as the mazurka or a polonaise. Lately, some schools have begun to allow students to perform their own choreographies with their chosen music, after or in between the old ballroom dances.

In the past, the style was to dress in Victorian gowns and in an old-fashioned way, but these days the attire is similar to U.S. proms. Usually, girls wear a long princess gown or a ball gown and the boys wear a black suit.
After the ball, the students sometimes attend a dinner in the evening, which is sometimes in a very formal restaurant. Students typically throw a party in the evening to celebrate further.

====France====
In France, high school students have only recently experienced prom. On June 27, 2013, more than 300 students in Paris, France held a prom. Event planning company White-Tie-Affair partnered up with multiple local companies to host the &quot;Solidarity Prom Ball&quot; charity gala. Food, drinks, venue, limousine, as well as gift bags were sponsored by the different companies and provided for the students for free. On top of that, famous French music groups Psy4 de la Rime and Alibi Montana were the guest performance of the evening. All proceeds from the students&#x27; entrance fee were donated to Donnons Leur Une Chance, a French non-profit organization that will help realize educational projects.

====Germany and Austria====
In Germany (and Austria), students celebrate their graduation from high school, or Gymnasium, with an Abifeier (from the graduation certificate or Abitur) or Maturaball (in Austria, the graduation exam is called Matura). In Germany, the events are informal and usually contain a series of student-organized activities that tend to make fun of teachers, sometimes with an extended hagiography about the favorite teacher. In Austria, the Maturaball is formal and can be seen as a synergy of proms and cotillions and often are highlights of the regional ball season (between November and the end of Carnival) referencing the glamour of the great ball tradition of the former Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. More like the prom is the German Abiball, that follows the official graduation ceremony. Here the students usually wear suits and ball gowns. The Abiball often follows a certain order with a welcome, introductions, an award ceremony for students, and sometimes an extended demonstration of all of the artistic outpourings of the students and staff. This is followed by a band (sometimes the school&#x27;s own band, if there is any) or a DJ playing music, usually starting with a waltz before moving on to other dancing. Alcohol is available at these events since the legal drinking age in Germany is 16 (for beer and wine), and most graduating students are 18 or older.

====Hungary====
In Hungary, students receive a ribbon to mark the beginning of the preparation for their graduation. Students receive this ribbon at a ball called &quot;szalagavató&quot;, meaning the &quot;inauguration of ribbons&quot;. Many of the students wear this ribbon on their jackets or shirts until graduation. This prom-like evening dance is traditionally held in the ball season of January–February, but November-December has gained popularity in recent years as well. At the beginning of the ball, after a short speech by the headteacher, each student gets the ribbon from their form teacher who pins it on their jacket or dress. Then a series of choreographed dances begin, which the students learned during the months leading up to the event. The first one is traditionally a dance called &quot;palotás&quot; (palace dance) performed by students from different classes, then each graduating class performs their own class dance, and finally, there&#x27;s a waltz, which is also performed by students from different classes. Occasionally, the teachers of the school perform a dance as well. After the ball of the evening organized by the school, students usually go out at night to drink to bars and discos, even if some of them are below the drinking age (18 in Hungary).

After they graduate, each class has its own party (without choreographed dances) usually at a restaurant, where their teachers are also invited. This is called &quot;érettségi bankett&quot; (graduation banquet).

====Ireland====
In most of the Republic of Ireland, a school leavers&#x27; dance is called a &quot;Debs&quot; or &quot;Grads&quot;, except in County Donegal, where, similar to most of the rest of Ulster, it is usually called &quot;the Prom&quot; or &quot;the Formal&quot;. In girls&#x27; schools, it is commonly referred to as a Debs (short for &quot;Debutante ball&quot;, though less formal than the high-society event sharing that name in other countries), and in boys&#x27; and coeducational schools, it may be referred to as a Grads or Grad (short for graduation). It is typically a formal dance for students who are graduating from secondary school (high school) in Ireland and is traditionally held between September and October. Alcohol is almost always served at these events, with a meal also being common.

====Lithuania====
In Lithuania, the prom is held after final exams, usually the same day when high school diplomas are presented. The event is called &quot;išleistuvės&quot;.

====Norway====
In Norway, this event varies from school to school. It is usually held during the winter months, and is often called &quot;Nyttårsball&quot; which means &quot;the new years ball.&quot; The students are not allowed to bring people from outside the school. In Norway, it is the norm to have proms for 8th, 9th, and 10th graders at Norwegian middle school, and most of the time, there is no division between formal and grad – students can attend in whatever clothing they choose, such as traditional knee-long dresses.

====Poland====
The Polish equivalent of the prom (&quot;studniówka&quot;) is a very popular event held each year throughout the country; the word itself means &quot;of or relating to 100 days&quot;. Most schools organize such an event about 100 days before the (matura) exam session. The first dance of the prom is the traditional Polish polonaise. In the past, the dress code for the &quot;studniówka&quot; was the same as for final exams, i.e. a white blouse or shirt with a dark skirt or trousers. As opposed to the &quot;studniówka&quot;, formal attire is required for the so-called Grand Ball (&quot;bal maturalny&quot;), held after graduation. Nowadays, as Grand Balls are rare, the &quot;studniówka&quot; has adopted a formal dress code.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, there was no prom tradition. However, during the last few years schools have adopted such a celebration. Usually, they happen before the end of the school year, in May or June, and are called &quot;Baile de Finalistas&quot; (Finalist&#x27;s Ball). Male students customarily wear business suits with dress ties or optionally semi-formal black tie, while female students typically wear dresses or evening gowns, although most schools do not enforce a strict dress code beyond &quot;vaguely formal&quot;. It is usually organized by a student association, elected at the beginning of the school year by the students to organize school events.

Although it happens in the majority of the country, on Madeira Island the tradition is a bit different. Instead of having the prom at the end of the year, the seniors have a ceremony called &quot;Benção das Capas&quot; (Cape&#x27;s Blessing), where they all use suits, including the girls, and a cape that is blessed by the city&#x27;s cardinal. Afterward, the students have dinner with their friends and family and then go to the prom. However, this prom isn&#x27;t formal, it ends up being similar to a club but in a different location, although sometimes it may happen at a club. Such a location is chosen by the student association. This ceremony ends up being very similar to one that the Portuguese students have when they finish college. The students only have a date to attend the first ceremony and they tend to go to the prom as groups.

====Romania====
In Romania, distinct proms are held each year in high schools and college for both the graduating students as well as the newly enrolled ones. They are called graduation balls and freshmen (&quot;boboci&quot;, meaning &quot;hatchlings&quot; in Romanian) balls, respectively. They are usually not black tie (informal). The venue is chosen by the teaching staff and can be any place, including the school gym or auditorium, a club, or a restaurant. It is common to charge students an admission tax in order to offset the cost. One or more bands or singers are usually hired to provide entertainment. Often the event is sponsored by local businesses. Access is usually controlled and limited to students of that particular high school or university, but exceptions can be made for relatives and it is not uncommon for students from other institutions to try to crash a particular prom. Freshmen proms usually include a popularity contest of some sort, which designates 3 girls and 3 boys as places I, II and III &quot;most popular&quot; as chosen by student vote; the candidates have to undergo various entertaining challenges, which usually include pair dancing. Generally speaking, freshmen proms are the more popular, with college freshmen proms often being publicized as club events and promoted by radio stations, who take the opportunity to introduce bands and singers. Whereas graduation proms are more subdued and often not a public or even a school-wide event, many graduating classes choosing to restrict attendance just to the actual graduates and their teachers.

====Belarus and Russia====

In Belarus and Russia proms are called &quot;Vypusknоi vechеr&quot; (&quot;Выпускной вечер&quot;), which literally means &quot;graduation evening&quot;. They take place from the 18th to the 20th or the 23rd to the 25th of June, after the state exams are completed. Proms are never held on the 21st/22nd because they took place on June 21 in 1941, but on the 22nd all graduates were drafted to fight the German invasion during World War II. First, all graduates receive their diplomas. Students with higher marks receive them first. Afterward, the prom continues as a school ball, traditionally with classic dances. Students may choose restaurants, cafes, or ships rather than school grounds to hold the events. Proms may be held in a discothèque, but it must start with the school waltz. At the conclusion of the prom evening, it is tradition to walk the whole night and watch the sunrise in the morning (on a hill, if applicable, in Moscow – Sparrow Hills).

====Slovakia====
In Slovakia, the closest thing to prom is Stužková, an occasion when the seniors get together with their parents, partners and teachers to celebrate their upcoming graduation. It takes place in November or December. Each of the students receives a green ribbon with their name on it (thus the name &quot;Stužková&quot;, the &quot;Ribbon Ball&quot;). The principal and the class teacher are given big green ribbons as well. Many of the students wear this ribbon on their jackets or shirts until graduation. Stužková typically includes a banquet, skits and songs prepared by students, as well as dancing. Men wear formal suits and women formal dresses. One week before Stužková is a ceremony of Pečatenie triednej knihy (Sealing of the grades book) so that teachers will not be able to give tests or do examinations of the students until Stužková. It is connected with some story and recorded on camera and then used as a part of the video of Stužková. It usually starts at 6 p.m. and ends in the early hours of the next morning (4a.m.).

====Slovenia====
In Slovenia, the equivalent is Maturantski ples. It is held before the final exams between January and May, depending on the region and school. Students can bring dates and/or close family to the ball. It is a custom that each student dances the last dance of the first sequence, a Vienna Walzer, with his mother/her father. There is also a dinner and live music.

====Spain====
In some places in Spain, proms are also celebrated as after-school parties. These parties are commonly called &quot;fiestas de graduación&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;graduation parties&quot;.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, this kind of event is usually known as &quot;Studentbalen&quot;. The word &quot;Studentbalen&quot; is a proper noun meaning &quot;The Student Ball,&quot; while the word studentbal is a common noun that can refer to any formal dinner and dance at a Swedish university. Studentbalen is usually held during the final weeks before graduating and can be formal.

====Switzerland====
The Swiss equivalent of a prom is the &quot;bal de printemps&quot;. Literally translated, this is a &quot;Spring Ball.&quot; At some schools in the German-speaking cantons, it is called &quot;Maturaball.&quot; This is not always organized by the schools, but sometimes by a student&#x27;s committee. It takes the most part before the final exams.

====Ukraine====
In Ukraine, prom is called &quot;Vypusknyi vechir&quot; or simply &quot;vypusknyi&quot; (&quot;Випускний вечір&quot; or simply &quot;Випускний&quot;), which literally means &quot;graduation evening&quot;. The date is defined by a school,; usually any date from late May to mid-June. Usually, &quot;vypusknyi&quot; consists of two parts. The first one called &quot;urochysta chastyna&quot; (&quot;урочиста частина&quot;, that means &quot;solemn part&quot;), during which graduates receive their diplomas and certificates of honor for exceptional achievements during studying. The first part is conducted in the first part of the day, while the second part usually starts in the evening. The time between the two parts is used to walk around a city and take some pictures. The second part, &quot;neofitsiyna chastyna&quot; (&quot;неофіційна частина&quot;, that means &quot;informal part&quot;), starts as a school ball, but after a round of waltz, it transforms into a conventional party. The venue of the second part is determined by graduates and their parents; usually, it takes place in school, cafe, restaurant, on a boat or at the country. Traditionally, the second part is attended by graduates, their parents, and teachers. However, school teachers and parents don&#x27;t mix with graduates. The second part ends with sunrise. Usually, each city has one or a few locations that are the most popular for watching a sunrise. That is why schools try not to have proms on the same date.

===Oceania===

In Australia and New Zealand, the event may often be described as a Ball, School Formal, or simply &quot;Formal&quot;. If the event is in the final year of high school (Year 12 for Australia, Year 13 for New Zealand), it is sometimes called a Dinner-dance, Leavers&#x27; Dinner or Debutante Ball but is also commonly called a School Formal or &quot;Formal.&quot; In Australia, some schools may also have a Valedictory Dinner, which is like the formal but has students, parents, and teachers instead of students and dates. Some Australian schools also have a &quot;Semi-formal&quot; for year 11 (16-17) students.

As the name suggests, attire for the occasion is generally formal. Boys will usually dress in a suit and tie. Girls traditionally wear formal gowns or dresses. In most cases a school formal is held at a local reception center or ballroom. A multicourse meal is generally provided. After the meal students generally dance to popular music played by a hired DJ or sometimes a band. Many students group together to go to the formal in a limousine. While parents do not attend a formal, teachers may act as chaperones for the formal and security guards are sometimes hired. The use of chaperones is intended to prevent the occurrence of violence and alcohol or drug use. Generally, after a formal, one or more after-parties are held.

In addition to the high school graduation &quot;formal&quot; that marks the end of Year 12, in New South Wales, Australia, there is also an event that is sometimes held to celebrate completing the School Certificate at the end of Year 10, and always held after receiving Higher School Certificate at the end of Year 12 and includes a dinner and dance. The NSW Government announced the abolition of the School Certificate after 2011, with students in year 10 that year being the final cohort to sit the external examinations and receive the qualification. Subsequent Year 10 &quot;Formals&quot; have been deemed &quot;unnecessary&quot; due to the fact that the majority of Year 10 students now progress to Year 11. In previous years when 25–30% of students left high school in Year 10, the Formal was seen as a celebration for those departing, however, Year 10 Formals are still sometimes celebrated in the name of tradition. In year 11, students occasionally organize a &quot;semi-formal&quot; or &quot;social&quot; at the end of the school year, which is a more casual version of a formal. If a school has a sister school the social is typically organized in conjunction with them, as a &quot;social event&quot; for people to mingle and meet new people. The Valedictory Dinner (or Val as it is colloquially called) is an event that only occurs in Year 12. In New Zealand, most state school balls are held in the winter months, between June and August, while in Australia, a &quot;formal&quot; is held at the end of the year to mark the end of schooling, as is the Valedictory Dinner.

In American Samoa, the typical Junior/Senior prom is held in most of the schools, an exception would be one of the private schools, which lets even 8th graders, freshmen, and sophomores participate in prom.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, most high schools and junior high (middle) schools have proms only for the graduating class (seniors), which is sometimes, depending on whether the school is private or public, preceded by a church service. The students dress in formal wear and may attend in couples. Some colleges have an after-graduation dinner dance.

The formals, or as called in Mexico &quot;galas&quot; or &quot;graduaciones&quot;, are normally held in the school&#x27;s gymnasium or in the schoolyard if the school is located in a low-income neighbourhood; normally, though, public schools located in high- or medium-income neighbourhoods and private schools rent a ballroom, usually in a hotel, and students and parents may chip in to cover the costs of the party.

A multicourse meal is often offered in private schools&#x27; proms; antojitos may be offered in low-budget proms instead.

===Central America, South America and the Caribbean===
Venezuelans also have a prom, commonly referred to as &quot;graduación&quot; or &quot;fiesta de graduación.&quot; It can consist of dancing, dinner, and live music.

In Argentina, there are &quot;fiestas de egresados&quot; for students finishing their last year of high school. These consist of big parties hosted by the senior students in local discos or other venues, starting at 10 p.m. until about 5 or 6 in the morning. They have dinner with parents and other members of the family, which may be at another venue such as the school, and on a different night altogether. After midnight friends and other guests join the dance. The parties start in late September after most students come back from their senior trip, commonly to Bariloche, and last until early December, after the graduation. The students may dress formally or casually, and the seniors may wear themed costumes.

In Brazil, &quot;bailes de formatura&quot; are usual at the end of high school and at college graduation. There is no crowning of a &quot;king&quot; or a &quot;queen,&quot; but evening gowns and suits are required. The family may or may not be included, and there may be a live band or DJ hired to command the music.

In Chile, proms, or &quot;fiestas de graduación&quot; (graduation parties), are usually held at convention centers or hotels after the &quot;licenciatura,&quot; or graduation from high school. They can also be held after taking the PSU (Chilean University Entrance Exam) in December. Students are expected to dress formally. They are allowed to go with dates or friends. After the dinner, the dance continues through the night into the next day.

In Colombia, many private schools usually have prom balls as well, usually consisting of a dinner, dancing, live music, and contests. They are usually held at hotels or clubs.

In Panama and Costa Rica, like many other American countries, the &quot;Baile de graduación&quot; is celebrated after finishing high school, where grade 11 is also the last year. It usually takes place before graduation to celebrate the end of school. It&#x27;s normally held in hotels or saloons with a dance floor, music and dinner. It starts with the students walking through the dance floor and dancing a waltz. The dinner comes after, and the rest of the night consists of dancing and celebration.

In Honduras, they are called &quot;Cena de Graduacion&quot;, they are held in luxury hotels, also familiars of the graduating students are invited. This event is held only for private schools, the act consists on formal graduation and delivery of their diplomas, after that, a dinner is held between the graduating students and their familiars or friends in the same room which later will become in a dance floor for everyone.

In Peru, proms—&quot;Fiestas de Promoción&quot;—are usually held at hotels, convention centers, or big residences. The dress code is formal. Some parents and teachers are often invited, but they don&#x27;t stay the whole night. Dinner is served as well as alcoholic drinks and delicatessen. Breakfast is often served the next day, at around 6–7 am. There is a growing tradition to hold a &quot;pre-prom&quot; for the students in the class below the graduating class, and even a &quot;pre-pre-prom&quot; for the students in the class below that. Prom students often graduate being 15-16 years old and start university right after.

In Trinidad and Tobago and most Caribbean countries, it is traditional for schools to hold a dance at the end of the CXC/GCE Advanced Level examination period. This is thrown simultaneously for fifth form and upper sixth form students during the months of June or July after the school&#x27;s official graduation ceremony. It is colloquially referred to as &quot;grad&quot; or &quot;gradz&quot;. Most &quot;gradz&quot; are held in popular clubs, hotels, halls or simply on the school&#x27;s grounds. Most schools allow students to bring dates, and a formal dress code is usually in effect.

In Uruguay, the most usual is to make a senior trip after graduation instead of a graduation party, common destinations are Florianópolis and Bariloche. However some schools or the students themselves may also organize a party. Usually, a place is rented, and formal parties are held. Students are allowed to take one guest, as a friend or as a partner.

==Homeschool proms==
The concept of extending prom to homeschool students has been realized in recent years. Although some school districts in the United States and Canada allow homeschool students to attend the prom in the school district where they reside, many homeschool groups also organize their own proms. Some states, such as Oregon, Ohio, Georgia, Tennessee, and Michigan, also host statewide homeschool proms, which any homeschool student in that state is welcome to attend.

Proms that are specifically geared toward homeschool students can sometimes be significantly different from traditional high school proms. It is not uncommon for a homeschool student to attend a homeschool prom solo, rather than taking a date. Often the music played is chosen by the parents rather than the students.

==Adult proms==
An adult prom is a social event that is almost perfectly similar to a high school prom in terms of themes and attire, except that some adult proms also serve alcoholic beverages, and therefore most adult proms (at least in the U.S.) require those attending to be at least 21 years of age. The origin of adult prom is unclear, though two events which occurred in the 1990s are likely to have inspired the concept. Drew Barrymore stated in a late 1990s interview on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; that she threw a prom party for herself and a few friends who never got to go to prom.
The Class of 1956 from Tenafly, New Jersey, whose prom was canceled at the time, held their own prom for their 35 Year Reunion in 1991.

In the &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Property&quot; novel series, character Mallorie Walcott, an event planner, mentions that she helped put her younger daughter Cassandra through college, in part, from the revenue she made from planning adult proms in the 1990s either for people who missed their actual high school proms in the 1970s and 1980s or simply wanted to re-live their prom night.

A form of adult prom is the &quot;second chance prom&quot;. It is a big gathering of people who either did not go to prom, wanted to relive prom, or whose high school prom did not work out the way they had hoped.

A slightly different take on the adult prom is that of the disabilities prom, dedicated to providing a prom experience to disabled adults at no charge to the attendees. These events are most often organized by non-profit organizations focusing on the disabled, or large churches.

In 2010, Theatrical producers in New York produced an audience participation theatrical play, set in an actual dance hall, called &quot;The Awesome 80s Prom&quot;, where attendees were at a prom and got to vote on the king and queen from the cast of characters.

==Anti-proms and alternative proms==
Anti-proms can be private, unofficial proms that are privately created, outside the control of the school, usually by people who disagree with their school&#x27;s prom policies. Some schools also include the anti-prom as an official event called MORP (Prom spelled backwards). MORP dances can be similar to a Sadie Hawkins dance where the girls ask a boy on a date, they can have informal attire, and the decor can be dark or less elegant.

Proms for gay and lesbian people who did not attend their proms with a date of the same sex are popular in some cities. These proms may also enable trans people who experienced prom before transitioning a chance to attend as the correct gender. A 1980 court decision, &quot;Fricke v. Lynch,&quot; required a public school in Rhode Island to allow same-sex dates, but discrimination against gay students continued for decades across the country.

==Controversies==
Proms have been the source of many controversies, many of which involve LGBT students.
* According to Jackie Blount, during the McCarthy era &quot;schools became implemented curricula intended to keep youth sexually straight. In effect, schools became fundamentally important agencies in the nationwide campaign to fight homosexuality.&quot; This attitude further promoted heteronormative practices such as naming a prom king and prom queen, requiring strict gender conformity in dress, etc.
* In 2002, gay teenager Marc Hall was prohibited from taking his male date to his high school&#x27;s dance; Hall sued the school board and won.
* In 2009, Tyler Frost was suspended for attending his girlfriend&#x27;s prom, because his Christian high school disallowed dancing. Although the principal at Frost&#x27;s school signed a paper allowing Frost to attend the prom, he said Frost would be suspended if he went, but Frost did so anyway.
* In a 2010 Itawamba County School District prom controversy, lesbian high school senior Constance McMillen requested to take her girlfriend to the prom at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton, Mississippi, where they were both students. The principal denied her request and prohibited her from wearing a tuxedo. When McMillen challenged the school&#x27;s policy, the prom was canceled, leading McMillen to sue the school. Following a court decision forcing the school to hold the prom, local parents organized a second prom in secret, leaving Constance, her girlfriend and only 5 other students at the official prom.
* In 2014, student Katie Bialy from Holy Cross Catholic Secondary School, St. Catharines, Ontario, with the genetic condition Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) was not allowed to go to prom by her school principal Denice Robertson because her grades were not as good as required and she could not graduate. Her condition had impaired her ability to do schoolwork and she asked the principal if she could go as a guest, but the principal refused her the option. This incident has resulted in public support for Bialy in social media and also increased awareness of her condition.

<doc id="238232" wikidata="Q842436" url="?curid=238232" title="Markov's inequality">
<text>In probability theory, Markov&#x27;s inequality gives an upper bound on the probability that a non-negative random variable is greater than or equal to some positive constant. Markov&#x27;s inequality is tight in the sense that for each chosen positive constant, there exists a random variable such that the inequality is in fact an equality.

It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, although it appeared earlier in the work of Pafnuty Chebyshev (Markov&#x27;s teacher), and many sources, especially in analysis, refer to it as Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality (sometimes, calling it the first Chebyshev inequality, while referring to Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality as the second Chebyshev inequality) or Bienaymé&#x27;s inequality.

Markov&#x27;s inequality (and other similar inequalities) relate probabilities to expectations, and provide (frequently loose but still useful) bounds for the cumulative distribution function of a random variable. Markov&#x27;s inequality can also be used to upper bound the expectation of a non-negative random variable in terms of its distribution function.

==Statement==
If is a nonnegative random variable and , then the probability
that is at least is at most the expectation of divided by :

:formula_1

When formula_2, we can take formula_3 for formula_4 to rewrite the previous inequality as

:formula_5

In the language of measure theory, Markov&#x27;s inequality states that if is a measure space, formula_6 is a measurable extended real-valued function, and , then

:formula_7

This measure-theoretic definition is sometimes referred to as Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality.

===Extended version for nondecreasing functions===
If is a nondecreasing nonnegative function, is a (not necessarily nonnegative) random variable, and , then

:formula_8

An immediate corollary, using higher moments of supported on values larger than 0, is

:formula_9
===The uniformly randomized Markov&#x27;s inequality===

If is a nonnegative random variable and , and is a uniformly distributed random variable on formula_10 that is independent of , then

:formula_11

Since is almost surely smaller than one, this bound is strictly stronger than Markov&#x27;s inequality. Remarkably, cannot be replaced by any constant smaller than one, meaning that deterministic improvements to Markov&#x27;s inequality cannot exist in general. While Markov&#x27;s inequality holds with equality for distributions supported on formula_12, the above randomized variant holds with equality for any distribution that is bounded on formula_13.
==Proofs==
We separate the case in which the measure space is a probability space from the more general case because the probability case is more accessible for the general reader.

===Intuition===
formula_14 where formula_15 is larger than or equal to 0 as the random variable formula_16 is non-negative and formula_17 is larger than or equal to formula_18 because the conditional expectation only takes into account of values larger than or equal to formula_18 which r.v. formula_16 can take.

Property 1: formula_21

Given a non-negative random variable formula_16, the conditional expectation formula_23 because formula_24. Also, probabilities are always non-negative, i.e., formula_25. Thus, the product:

formula_21.

This is intuitive since conditioning on formula_27 still results in non-negative values, ensuring the product remains non-negative.

Property 2: formula_28

For formula_29, the expected value given formula_30 is at least formula_31. Multiplying both sides by formula_32, we get:

formula_33.

This is intuitive since all values considered are at least formula_18, making their average also greater than or equal to formula_18.

Hence intuitively, formula_36, which directly leads to formula_37.

===Probability-theoretic proof===
Method 1:
From the definition of expectation: 
:formula_38

However, X is a non-negative random variable thus, 
:formula_39

From this we can derive, 
:formula_40

From here, dividing through by formula_18 allows us to see that 

:formula_42

Method 2:
For any event formula_43, let formula_44 be the indicator random variable of formula_45, that is, formula_46 if formula_43 occurs and formula_48 otherwise.

Using this notation, we have formula_49 if the event formula_50 occurs, and formula_51 if formula_52. Then, given formula_53,

:formula_54

which is clear if we consider the two possible values of formula_50. If formula_52, then formula_51, and so formula_58. Otherwise, we have formula_50, for which formula_60 and so formula_61.

Since formula_62 is a monotonically increasing function, taking expectation of both sides of an inequality cannot reverse it. Therefore,

:formula_63

Now, using linearity of expectations, the left side of this inequality is the same as

:formula_64

Thus we have

:formula_65

and since &quot;a&quot; &gt; 0, we can divide both sides by &quot;a&quot;.

===Measure-theoretic proof===
We may assume that the function formula_6 is non-negative, since only its absolute value enters in the equation. Now, consider the real-valued function &quot;s&quot; on &quot;X&quot; given by

:formula_67

Then formula_68. By the definition of the Lebesgue integral

:formula_69

and since formula_70, both sides can be divided by formula_71, obtaining

:formula_72

===Discrete case===
We now provide a proof for the special case when formula_16 is a discrete random variable which only takes on non-negative integer values. 

Let formula_18 be a positive integer. By definition formula_75 
formula_76 
formula_77 
formula_78
formula_79
formula_80

Dividing by formula_18 yields the desired result.

==Corollaries==

=== Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality ===
Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality uses the variance to bound the probability that a random variable deviates far from the mean. Specifically, 

:formula_82

for any . Here is the variance of X, defined as:

:formula_83

Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality follows from Markov&#x27;s inequality by considering the random variable

: formula_84

and the constant formula_85 for which Markov&#x27;s inequality reads

: formula_86

This argument can be summarized (where &quot;MI&quot; indicates use of Markov&#x27;s inequality):

:formula_87

===Other corollaries===
#The &quot;monotonic&quot; result can be demonstrated by:
#:formula_88
#The result that, for a nonnegative random variable , the quantile function of satisfies:
#:formula_89
#:the proof using
#:formula_90
#Let formula_91 be a self-adjoint matrix-valued random variable and formula_92. Then
#:formula_93
#:which can be proved similarly.

==Examples==
Assuming no income is negative, Markov&#x27;s inequality shows that no more than 10% (1/10) of the population can have more than 10 times the average income. 

Another simple example is as follows: Andrew makes 4 mistakes on average on his Statistics course tests. The best upper bound on the probability that Andrew will do at least 10 mistakes is 0.4 as formula_94 Note that Andrew might do exactly 10 mistakes with probability 0.4 and make no mistakes with probability 0.6; the expectation is exactly 4 mistakes.

<text>Mauro Nervi (born 1959) is an Italian poet in the Esperanto language.

Nervi was born in La Spezia, a port town in northern Italy. A student of medicine, he gained his M.D. as a general surgeon. Since 1984 he has worked in the department of surgery at the University of Pisa. Afterwards, he received a Ph.D. in 1994 in German and a Ph.D. in classical literature in 1999 from the same university. Since 1995 he has written critical material on Kafka, Goethe, Kleist and Holderlin in cooperation with the Department of German Studies.

Nervi married with Angela in 1992 and has two daughters, Serena (2002) and Dorabella (2005). He is now interested in philosophy and logic.

== Works ==
Nervi first gained renown for his poems when he was only 18 years old, and 1978 saw the publication of his first collection &quot;La turoj de l&#x27; ĉefurbo&quot; (&quot;The Towers of the Capital&quot;). Although in retrospect some parts are immature, here the young Nervi already showed impressive skill. From his knowledge of classical literature came several poems from this volume, including a poetic drama based on the murder of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra, and a cycle of seven poems, each for one of the Muses.

After the publication of his first book, Nervi continued to write poetry, which appeared in several literary reviews including &quot;Fonto&quot; and &quot;Literatura Foiro&quot;. In 1986 his translation in Esperanto of &quot;Il repertorio della memoria&quot; by Eugenio Montale was used as the introduction to Spomenka Štimec&#x27;s novel &quot;Ombro sur interna pejzaĝo&quot;. 1996 saw the appearance of his translation of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;.

Nervi&#x27;s second collection, &quot;Havenoj&quot; (&quot;Ports&quot;) was published in 2001. Leaving behind the classical themes of &quot;La turoj de l&#x27; ĉefurbo&quot;, &quot;Havenoj&quot; contains much sea imagery and was also inspired in part by his studies of German literature, for which he received his second doctorate.

For his poetry Nervi has gained several literary prizes.

<doc id="238244" wikidata="Q728502" url="?curid=238244" title="Nautical chart">
<text>A nautical chart or hydrographic chart is a graphic representation of a sea region or water body and adjacent coasts or banks. Depending on the scale of the chart, it may show depths of water (bathymetry) and heights of land (topography), natural features of the seabed, details of the coastline, navigational hazards, locations of natural and human-made aids to navigation, information on tides and currents, local details 
of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and human-made structures such as harbours, buildings, and bridges. Nautical charts are essential tools for marine navigation; many countries require vessels, especially commercial ships, to carry them. Nautical charting may take the form of charts printed on paper (raster navigational charts) or computerized electronic navigational charts. Recent technologies have made available paper charts which are printed &quot;on demand&quot; with cartographic data that has been downloaded to the commercial printing company as recently as the night before printing. With each daily download, critical data such as Local Notices to Mariners are added to the on-demand chart files so that these charts are up to date at the time of printing.

== Data sources ==

Nautical charts are based on hydrographic surveys and bathymetric surveys. As surveying is laborious and time-consuming, hydrographic data for many areas of sea may be dated and are sometimes unreliable. Depths are measured in a variety of ways. Historically the sounding line was used. In modern times, echo sounding is used for measuring the seabed in the open sea. When measuring the safe depth of water over an entire obstruction, such as a shipwreck, the minimum depth is checked by sweeping the area with a length of horizontal wire. This ensures that difficult to find projections, such as masts, do not present a danger to vessels navigating over the obstruction.

== Publication ==
Nautical charts are issued by power of the national hydrographic offices in many countries. These charts are considered &quot;official&quot; in contrast to those made by commercial publishers. Many hydrographic offices provide regular, sometimes weekly, manual updates of their charts through their sales agents. Individual hydrographic offices produce national chart series and international chart series. Coordinated by the International Hydrographic Organization, the international chart series is a worldwide system of charts (&quot;INT&quot; chart series), which is being developed with the goal of unifying as many chart systems as possible.

There are also commercially published charts, some of which may carry additional information of particular interest, e.g. for yacht skippers.

== Chart correction ==

The nature of a waterway depicted by a chart may change, and artificial aids to navigation may be altered at short notice. Therefore, old or uncorrected charts should never be used for navigation. Every producer of nautical charts also provides a system to inform mariners of changes that affect the chart. In the United States, chart corrections and notifications of new editions are provided by various governmental agencies by way of Notice to Mariners, Local Notice to Mariners, Summary of Corrections, and Broadcast Notice to Mariners. In the U.S., NOAA also has a printing partner who prints the &quot;POD&quot; (print on demand) NOAA charts, and they contain the very latest corrections and notifications at the time of printing. To give notice to mariners, radio broadcasts provide advance notice of urgent corrections.

A good way to keep track of corrections is with a &quot;Chart and Publication Correction Record Card&quot; system. Using this system, the navigator does not immediately update every chart in the portfolio when a new &quot;Notice to Mariners&quot; arrives, instead creating a card for every chart and noting the correction on this card. When the time comes to use the chart, he pulls the chart and chart&#x27;s card, and makes the indicated corrections on the chart. This system ensures that every chart is properly corrected prior to use. A prudent mariner should obtain a new chart if he has not kept track of corrections and his chart is more than several months old.

Various Digital Notices to Mariners systems are available on the market such as Digitrace, Voyager, or ChartCo, to correct British Admiralty charts as well as NOAA charts. These systems provide only vessel relevant corrections via e-mail or web downloads, reducing the time needed to sort out corrections for each chart. Tracings to assist corrections are provided at the same time.

The Canadian Coast Guard produces the Notice to Mariners publication which informs mariners of important navigational safety matters affecting Canadian Waters. This electronic publication is published on a monthly basis and can be downloaded from the Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) Web site. The information in the Notice to Mariners is formatted to simplify the correction of paper charts and navigational publications.

Various and diverse methods exist for the correction of electronic navigational charts.

=== Limitations ===

In 1973 the cargo ship &quot;MV Muirfield&quot; (a merchant vessel named after Muirfield, Scotland) struck an unknown object in the Indian Ocean in waters charted at a depth of greater than 5,000 metres (16,404 ft), resulting in extensive damage to her keel. In 1983, HMAS &quot;Moresby&quot;, a Royal Australian Navy survey ship, surveyed the area where &quot;Muirfield&quot; was damaged, and charted in detail a previously unsuspected hazard to navigation, the Muirfield Seamount. The dramatic accidental discovery of the Muirfield Seamount is often cited as an example of limitations in the vertical geodetic datum accuracy of some offshore areas as represented on nautical charts, especially on small-scale charts.

A similar incident involving a passenger ship occurred in 1992 when the Cunard liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; struck a submerged rock off Block Island in the Atlantic Ocean. In November 1999, the semi-submersible, heavy-lift ship &quot;Mighty Servant 2&quot; capsized and sank after hitting an uncharted single underwater isolated pinnacle of granite off Indonesia. Five crew members died and &quot;Mighty Servant 2&quot; was declared a total loss. More recently, in 2005 the submarine USS &quot;San Francisco&quot; ran into an uncharted seamount (sea mountain) about 560 kilometres (350 statute miles) south of Guam at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman. In September 2006 the jack-up barge &quot;Octopus&quot; ran aground on an uncharted sea mount within the Orkney Islands (United Kingdom) while being towed by the tug &quot;Harold&quot;. £1M worth of damage was caused to the barge and delayed work on the installation of a tidal energy generator prototype. As stated in the Mariners Handbook and subsequent accident report: &quot;No chart is infallible. Every chart is liable to be incomplete&quot;.

== Map projection, positions, and bearings ==

Historically the first projection, invented by Marinus of Tyre ca. AD 100 according to Ptolemy, was what is now called equirectangular projection (historically called plane chart, &quot;plate carrée&quot;, ). While it is very convenient for small seas like the Aegean, it is unsuitable for seas larger than Mediterranean or an open ocean, even though early explorers had to use it for want of a better.

The Mercator projection is now used on the vast majority of nautical charts. Since the Mercator projection is conformal, that is, bearings in the chart are identical to the corresponding angles in nature, courses plotted on the chart may be used directly as the course-to-steer at the helm.

The gnomonic projection is used for charts intended for plotting of great circle routes. NOAA uses the polyconic projection for some of its charts of the Great Lakes, at both large and small scales.

Positions of places shown on the chart can be measured from the longitude and latitude scales on the borders of the chart, relative to a geodetic datum such as WGS 84.

A bearing is the angle between the line joining the two points of interest and the line from one of the points to the north, such as a ship&#x27;s course or a compass reading to a landmark. On nautical charts, the top of the chart is always true north, rather than magnetic north, towards which a compass points. Most charts include a compass rose depicting the variation between magnetic and true north.

However, the use of the Mercator projection has drawbacks. This projection shows the lines of longitude as parallel. On the real globe, the lines of longitude converge as they approach the north or south pole. This means that east–west distances are exaggerated at high latitudes. To keep the projection conformal, the projection increases the displayed distance between lines of latitude (north–south distances) in proportion; thus a square is shown as a square everywhere on the chart, but a square on the Arctic Circle appears much bigger than a square of the same size at the equator. In practical use, this is less of a problem than it sounds. One minute of latitude is, for practical purposes, a nautical mile. Distances in nautical miles can therefore be measured on the latitude gradations printed on the side of the chart.

== Electronic and paper charts ==
Conventional nautical charts are printed on large sheets of paper at a variety of scales. Mariners will generally carry many charts to provide sufficient detail for the areas they might need to visit. Electronic navigational charts, which use computer software and electronic databases to provide navigation information, can augment or in some cases replace paper charts, though many mariners carry paper charts as a backup in case the electronic charting system fails.

== Details on a nautical chart ==

Many countries&#x27; hydrographic agencies publish a &quot;Chart 1&quot;, which explains all of the symbols, terms and abbreviations used on charts that they produce for both domestic and international use. Each country starts with the base symbology specified in IHO standard INT 1, and is then permitted to add its own supplemental symbologies to its domestic charts, which are also explained in its version of Chart 1. Ships are typically required to carry copies of Chart 1 with their paper charts.

=== Labels ===
Nautical charts must be labeled with navigational and depth information. There are a few commercial software packages that do automatic label placement for any kind of map or chart. Modern systems render electronic charts consistent with the IHO S-52 specification, issued by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). 

=== Pilotage information ===
The chart uses symbols to provide pilotage information about the nature and position of features useful to navigators, such as sea bed information, sea mark, and landmarks. Some symbols describe the sea bed with information such as its depth, materials as well as possible navigational hazards such as shipwrecks. Other symbols show the position and characteristics of navigational aids such as buoys, lights, lighthouses, coastal and land features and structures that are useful for position fixing. The abbreviation &quot;ED&quot; is commonly used to label geographic locations whose existence is doubtful.

Colours distinguish between human-made features, dry land, sea bed that dries with the tide, and seabed that is permanently underwater and indicate water depth.

=== Depths and heights ===
Depths which have been measured are indicated by the numbers shown on the chart. Depths on charts published in most parts of the world use metres. Older charts, as well as those published by the United States government, may use feet or fathoms. Depth contour lines show the shape of underwater relief. Coloured areas of the sea emphasise shallow water and dangerous underwater obstructions. Depths are measured from the chart datum, which is related to the local sea level. The chart datum varies according to the standard used by each national Hydrographic Office. In general, the trend is towards using lowest astronomical tide (LAT), the lowest tide predicted in the full tidal cycle, but in non-tidal areas and some tidal areas Mean Sea Level (MSL) is used.

Heights, e.g. a lighthouse, are generally given relative to mean high water spring (MHWS). Vertical clearances, e.g. below a bridge or cable, are given relative to highest astronomical tide (HAT). The chart will indicate what datum is in use.

The use of HAT for heights and LAT for depths, means that the mariner can quickly look at the chart to ensure that they have sufficient clearance to pass any obstruction, though they may have to calculate height of tide to ensure their safety.

=== Tidal information ===

Tidal races and strong currents have special chart symbols. Tidal flow information may be shown on charts using tidal diamonds, indicating the speed and bearing of the tidal flow during each hour of the tidal cycle.

<text>Jorge Camacho Cordón (born 18 November 1966, Zafra) is a writer in Esperanto and Spanish.

Camacho was born in Zafra, Spain and learned Esperanto in 1980. He was a member of the Academy of Esperanto from 1992 until 2001. Since 1995 he has worked in Brussels as an interpreter for the European Union from English and Finnish into Spanish.

Camacho was elected to the Academy of Esperanto in 1992, but on 15 August 2001 he announced his resignation due to disappointment with the Esperanto movement. However, he remains active in Esperanto and continues to review literary works.

== Works ==
Camacho became famous for his poems and short stories in the late 1980s, for which he received several prizes in the &quot;Belartaj Konkursoj de UEA&quot;. In 1992 he won the Grabowski Prize, a prize for young authors writing in Esperanto. The prize is named after Antoni Grabowski.

Camacho was in the early 1990s considered a member of the so-called &quot;Ibera Skolo&quot; (&quot;Iberian School&quot;) of Esperanto writers along with three other inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula.

In the 1990s, Camacho began to publicly oppose Giorgio Silfer for his interpretation of the political view &quot;Raumism&quot;. He wrote &quot;La Majstro kaj Martinelli&quot; (&quot;The Master and Martinelli&quot;), a biting satire of Silfer (inspired by the similarly titled novel of Mikhail Bulgakov), and criticised his ideology in &quot;La liturgio de la foiro&quot; (&quot;The Liturgy of the Fair&quot;).

=== Poetry in Esperanto ===
* &quot;Ibere libere&quot; (with Miguel Fernández, Gonçalo Neves and Liven Dek, pseudonym of Miguel Gutiérrez, 1993)
* &quot;Celakantoj&quot; (&quot;Coelacanths&quot;; poems written in Esperanto c. 1989-1995, 2004)
* &quot;Saturno&quot; (&quot;Saturn&quot;; bilingual collection of poems written both in Spanish and Esperanto c. 1995-2004, 2004)
* &quot;Eklipsas&quot; (&quot;[It] eclipses&quot;; collection of poems written mainly in Esperanto 2004-2006, with translations into Spanish, 2007)
* &quot;Koploj kaj filandroj&quot; (poems written in Esperanto, 2009)

=== Poetry in Spanish ===
* &quot;Palestina estrangulada&quot; (Calúmnia, 2018)
* &quot;Quemadura&quot; (Vitruvio, 2020)

== Editorial work ==
Until December 2014 Jorge Camacho was editor-in-chief of the literary almanac &quot;Beletra Almanako&quot;, which was first issued in the autumn of 2007.

<doc id="238246" wikidata="Q583313" url="?curid=238246" title="Megatsunami">
<text>A megatsunami is a very large wave created by a large, sudden displacement of material into a body of water.

Megatsunamis have different features from ordinary tsunamis. Ordinary tsunamis are caused by underwater tectonic activity (movement of the earth&#x27;s plates) and therefore occur along plate boundaries and as a result of earthquakes and the subsequent rise or fall in the sea floor that displaces a volume of water. Ordinary tsunamis exhibit shallow waves in the deep waters of the open ocean that increase dramatically in height upon approaching land to a maximum run-up height of around in the cases of the most powerful earthquakes. By contrast, megatsunamis occur when a large amount of material suddenly falls into water or anywhere near water (such as via a landslide, meteor impact, or volcanic eruption). They can have extremely large initial wave heights in the hundreds of metres, far beyond the height of any ordinary tsunami. These giant wave heights occur because the water is &quot;splashed&quot; upwards and outwards by the displacement.

Examples of modern megatsunamis include the one associated with the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa (volcanic eruption), the 1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami (a landslide which caused an initial wave of ), and the 1963 Vajont Dam landslide (caused by human activity destabilizing sides of valley). Prehistoric examples include the Storegga Slide (landslide), and the Chicxulub, Chesapeake Bay, and Eltanin meteor impacts.

== Overview ==

A megatsunami is a tsunami with an initial wave amplitude (height) measured in many tens or hundreds of metres. The term &quot;megatsunami&quot; has been defined by media and has no precise definition, although it is commonly taken to refer to tsunamis over high. A megatsunami is a separate class of event from an ordinary tsunami and is caused by different physical mechanisms.

Normal tsunamis result from displacement of the sea floor due to movements in the Earth&#x27;s crust (plate tectonics). Powerful earthquakes may cause the sea floor to displace vertically on the order of tens of metres, which in turn displaces the water column above and leads to the formation of a tsunami. Ordinary tsunamis have a small wave height offshore and generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a slight swell on the order of above the normal sea surface. In deep water it is possible that a tsunami could pass beneath a ship without the crew of the vessel noticing. As it approaches land, the wave height of an ordinary tsunami increases dramatically as the sea floor slopes upward and the base of the wave pushes the water column above it upwards. Ordinary tsunamis, even those associated with the most powerful strike-slip earthquakes, typically do not reach heights in excess of .

By contrast, megatsunamis are caused by landslides and other impact events that displace large volumes of water, resulting in waves that may exceed the height of an ordinary tsunami by tens or even hundreds of metres. Underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions do not normally generate megatsunamis, but landslides next to bodies of water resulting from earthquakes or volcanic eruptions can, since they cause a much larger amount of water displacement. If the landslide or impact occurs in a limited body of water, as happened at the Vajont Dam (1963) and in Lituya Bay (1958) then the water may be unable to disperse and one or more exceedingly large waves may result.

Submarine landslides can pose a significant hazard when they cause a tsunami. Although a variety of different types of landslides can cause tsunami, all the resulting tsunami have similar features such as large run-ups close to the tsunami, but quicker attenuation compared to tsunami caused by earthquakes. An example of this was the 17 July 1998, Papua New Guinean landslide tsunami where waves up to 15 m high impacted a 20 km section of the coast killing 2,200 people, yet at greater distances the tsunami was not a major hazard. This is due to the comparatively small source area of most landslide tsunami (relative to the area affected by large earthquakes) which causes the generation of shorter wavelength waves. These waves are greatly affected by coastal amplification (which amplifies the local effect) and radial damping (which reduces the distal effect).

The size of landslide-generated tsunamis depends both on the geological details of the landslide (such as its Froude number) and also on assumptions about the hydrodynamics of the model used to simulate tsunami generation, thus they have a large margin of uncertainty. Generally, landslide-induced tsunamis decay more quickly with distance than earthquake-induced tsunamis, as the former, often having a dipole structure at the source, tend to spread out radially and has a shorter wavelength (the rate at which a wave loses energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength, in other words the longer the wavelength of a wave, the slower it loses energy) while the latter disperses little as it propagates away perpendicularly to the source fault. Testing whether a given tsunami model is correct is complicated by the rarity of giant collapses.

Recent findings show that the nature of a tsunami is dependent upon volume, velocity, initial acceleration, length and thickness of the contributing landslide. Volume and initial acceleration are the key factors which determine whether a landslide will form a tsunami. A sudden deceleration of the landslide may also result in larger waves. The length of the slide influences both the wavelength and the maximum wave height. Travel time or run out distance of slide will also influence the resulting tsunami wavelength. In most cases the submarine landslides are noticeably subcritical, that is the Froude number (the ratio of slide speed to wave propagation) is significantly less than one. This suggests that the tsunami will move away from the wave generating slide preventing the buildup of the wave. Failures in shallow waters tend to produce larger tsunamis because the wave is more critical as the speed of propagation is less here. Furthermore, shallower waters are generally closer to the coast meaning that there is less radial damping by the time the tsunami reaches the shore. Conversely tsunamis triggered by earthquakes are more critical when the seabed displacement occurs in the deep ocean as the first wave (which is less affected by depth) has a shorter wavelength and is enlarged when travelling from deeper to shallower waters.

Determining a height range typical of megatsunamis is a complex and scientifically debated topic. This complexity is increased due to the fact that two different heights are often reported for tsunamis – the height of the wave itself in open water, and the height to which it surges when it encounters land. Depending upon the locale, this second or so-called &quot;run-up height&quot; can be several times larger than the wave&#x27;s height just before reaching shore. While there is currently no minimum or average height classification for megatsunamis that is broadly accepted by the scientific community, the limited number of observed megatsunami events in recent history have all had run-up heights that exceeded . The megatsunami in Spirit Lake, Washington, USA that was caused by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens reached , while the tallest megatsunami ever recorded (Lituya Bay in 1958) reached a run-up height of . It is also possible that much larger megatsunamis occurred in prehistory; researchers analyzing the geological structures left behind by prehistoric asteroid impacts have suggested that these events could have resulted in megatsunamis that exceeded in height.

== Recognition of the concept of megatsunami==
Before the 1950s, scientists had theorized that tsunamis orders of magnitude larger than those observed with earthquakes could have occurred as a result of ancient geological processes, but no concrete evidence of the existence of these &quot;monster waves&quot; had yet been gathered. Geologists searching for oil in Alaska in 1953 observed that in Lituya Bay, mature tree growth did not extend to the shoreline as it did in many other bays in the region. Rather, there was a band of younger trees closer to the shore. Forestry workers, glaciologists, and geographers call the boundary between these bands a trim line. Trees just above the trim line showed severe scarring on their seaward side, while those from below the trim line did not. This indicated that a large force had impacted all of the elder trees above the trim line, and presumably had killed off all the trees below it. Based on this evidence, the scientists hypothesized that there had been an unusually large wave or waves in the deep inlet. Because this is a recently deglaciated fjord with steep slopes and crossed by a major fault (the Fairweather Fault), one possibility was that this wave was a landslide-generated tsunami.

On 9 July 1958, a 7.8 strike-slip earthquake in southeast Alaska caused of rock and ice to drop into the deep water at the head of Lituya Bay. The block fell almost vertically and hit the water with sufficient force to create a wave that surged up the opposite side of the head of the bay to a height of , and was still many tens of metres high further down the bay when it carried eyewitnesses Howard Ulrich and his son Howard Jr. over the trees in their fishing boat. They were washed back into the bay and both survived.

== Analysis of mechanism==
The mechanism giving rise to megatsunamis was analysed for the Lituya Bay event in a study presented at the Tsunami Society in 1999; this model was considerably developed and modified by a second study in 2010.

Although the earthquake which caused the megatsunami was considered very energetic, it was determined that it could not have been the sole contributor based on the measured height of the wave. Neither water drainage from a lake, nor a landslide, nor the force of the earthquake itself were sufficient to create a megatsunami of the size observed, although all of these may have been contributing factors.

Instead, the megatsunami was caused by a combination of events in quick succession. The primary event occurred in the form of a large and sudden impulsive impact when about 40 million cubic yards of rock several hundred metres above the bay was fractured by the earthquake, and fell &quot;practically as a monolithic unit&quot; down the almost-vertical slope and into the bay. The rockfall also caused air to be &quot;dragged along&quot; due to viscosity effects, which added to the volume of displacement, and further impacted the sediment on the floor of the bay, creating a large crater. The study concluded that:

A 2010 model that examined the amount of infill on the floor of the bay, which was many times larger than that of the rockfall alone, and also the energy and height of the waves, and the accounts given by eyewitnesses, concluded that there had been a &quot;dual slide&quot; involving a rockfall, which also triggered a release of 5 to 10 times its volume of sediment trapped by the adjacent Lituya Glacier, as an almost immediate and many times larger second slide, a ratio comparable with other events where this &quot;dual slide&quot; effect is known to have happened.

== Examples ==
=== Prehistoric ===
* An astronomical object between wide traveling at per second struck the Earth 3.26 billion years ago east of what is now Johannesburg, South Africa, near South Africa&#x27;s border with Eswatini, in what was then an Archean ocean that covered most of the planet, creating a crater about wide. The impact generated a megatsunami that probably extended to a depth of thousands of meters beneath the surface of the ocean and rose to the height of a skyscraper when it reached shorelines. The resultant event created the Barberton Greenstone Belt.
* The asteroid linked to the extinction of dinosaurs, which created the Chicxulub crater in the Yucatán Peninsula approximately 66 million years ago, would have caused a megatsunami over tall. The height of the tsunami was limited due to relatively shallow sea in the area of the impact; had the asteroid struck in the deep sea the megatsunami would have been tall. Among the mechanisms triggering megatsunamis were the direct impact, shockwaves, returning water in the crater with a new push outward and seismic waves with a magnitude up to ~11. A more recent simulation of the global effects of the Chicxulub megatsunami showed an initial wave height of , with later waves up to in height in the Gulf of Mexico, and up to in the North Atlantic and South Pacific; the discovery of mega-ripples in Louisiana via seismic imaging data, with average wavelengths of and average wave heights of , looks like to confirm it. David Shonting and Cathy Ezrailson propose an &quot;Edgerton effect&quot; mechanism generating the megatsunami, similar to a milk drop falling on water that triggers a crown-shape water column, with a comparable height to the Chicxulub impactor&#x27;s, that means over for the initial seawater forced outward by the explosion and blast waves; then, its collapse triggers megatsunamis changing their height according to the different water depth, raising up to . Furthermore, the initial shock wave via impact triggered seismic waves producing giant landslides and slumping around the region (the largest known event deposits on Earth) with subsequent megatsunamis of various sizes, and seiches of in Tanis, away, part of a vast inland sea at the time and directly triggered via seismic shaking by the impact within a few minutes.
* During the Messinian (ca. 7.25–ca. 5.3 million years ago) various megatsunamis likely struck the coast of northern Chile.
* Reservoir-induced seismicity at the end of or shortly after the Zanclean Flood (ca. 5.33 million years ago), which rapidly filled the Mediterranean Basin with water from the Atlantic Ocean, created a megatsunami with a height of nearly which struck the coast of Spain near what is now Algeciras.
* A megatsunami affected the coast of south–central Chile in the Pliocene as evidenced by the sedimentary record of the Ranquil Formation.
* The Eltanin impact in the southeast Pacific Ocean 2.5 million years ago caused a megatsunami that was over high in southern Chile and the Antarctic Peninsula; the wave swept across much of the Pacific Ocean.
* The northern half of the East Molokai Volcano on Molokai in Hawaii suffered a catastrophic collapse about 1.5 million years ago, generating a megatsunami, and now lies as a debris field scattered northward across the ocean bottom, while what remains on the island are the highest sea cliffs in the world. The megatsunami may have reached a height of near its origin and reached California and Mexico.
* The existence of large scattered boulders in only one of the four marine terraces of Herradura Bay south of the Chilean city of Coquimbo has been interpreted by Roland Paskoff as the result of a mega-tsunami that occurred in the Middle Pleistocene.
* In Hawaii, a megatsunami at least in height deposited marine sediments at a modern-day elevation of – above sea level at the time the wave struck – on Lanai about 105,000 years ago. The tsunami also deposited such sediments at an elevation of on Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and the island of Hawaii.
* The collapse of the ancestral Mount Amarelo on Fogo in the Cape Verde Islands about 73,000 years ago triggered a megatsunami which struck Santiago, away, with a height of and a run-up height of over . The wave swept boulders inland and deposited them above sea level
* A major collapse of the western edge of the Lake Tahoe basin, a landslide with a volume of which formed McKinney Bay between 21,000 and 12,000 years ago, generated megatsunamis/seiche waves with an initial height of probably about and caused the lake&#x27;s water to slosh back and forth for days. Much of the water in the megatsunamis washed over the lake&#x27;s outlet at what is now Tahoe City, California, and flooded down the Truckee River, carrying house-sized boulders as far downstream as the California-Nevada border at what is now Verdi, California.
* In the North Sea, the Storegga Slide caused a megatsunami approximately 8,200 years ago. It is estimated to have completely flooded the remainder of Doggerland.
* Around 6370 BCE, a landslide on the eastern slope of Mount Etna in Sicily into the Mediterranean Sea triggered a megatsunami in the Eastern Mediterranean with an initial wave height along the eastern coast of Sicily of . It struck the Neolithic village of Atlit Yam off the coast of Israel with a height of , prompting the village&#x27;s abandonment.
* Around 5650 B.C., a landslide in Greenland created a megatsunami with a run-up height on Alluttoq Island of .
* Around 5350 B.C., a landslide in Greenland created a megatsunami with a run-up height on Alluttoq Island of .

==== c. 2000 BC: Réunion ====
* A landslide on Réunion island, to the east of Madagascar, may have caused a megatsunami.

==== c. 1600 BC: Santorini ====

* The Thera volcano erupted, the force of the eruption causing megatsunamis which affected the whole Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

==== c. 1100 BC: Lake Crescent ====
* An earthquake generated the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide, which fell from Mount Storm King in what is now Washington in the United States and entered waters at least deep in Lake Crescent, generating a megatsunami with an estimated maximum run-up height of .

=== Modern ===

==== 1674: Ambon Island, Banda Sea ====

On 17 February 1674, between 19:30 and 20:00 local time, an earthquake struck the Maluku Islands. Ambon Island received run-up heights of , making the wave far too large to be caused by the quake itself. Instead, it was probably the result of an underwater landslide triggered by the earthquake. The quake and tsunami killed 2,347 people.

==== 1731: Storfjorden, Norway====
At 10:00 p.m. on 8 January 1731, a landslide with a volume of possibly fell from the mountain Skafjell from a height of into the Storfjorden opposite Stranda, Norway. The slide generated a megatsunami in height that struck Stranda, flooding the area for inland and destroying the church and all but two boathouses, as well as many boats. Damaging waves struck as far away as Ørskog. The waves killed 17 people.

==== 1741: Oshima-Ōshima, Sea of Japan ====

An eruption of Oshima-Ōshima occurred that lasted from 18 August 1741 to 1 May 1742. On 29 August 1741, a devastating tsunami occurred. It killed at least 1,467 people along a section of the coast, excluding native residents whose deaths were not recorded. Wave heights for Gankakezawa have been estimated at based on oral histories, while an estimate of is derived from written records. At Sado Island, over away, a wave height of has been estimated based on descriptions of the damage, while oral records suggest a height of . Wave heights have been estimated at even as far away as the Korean Peninsula. There is still no consensus in the debate as to what caused it but much evidence points to a landslide and debris avalanche along the flank of the volcano. An alternative hypothesis holds that an earthquake caused the tsunami. The event reduced the elevation of the peak of Hishiyama from . An estimated section of the volcano collapsed onto the seafloor north of the island; the collapse was similar in size to the collapse which occurred during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

==== 1756: Langfjorden, Norway====
Just before 8:00 p.m. on 22 February 1756, a landslide with a volume of travelled at high speed from a height of on the side of the mountain Tjellafjellet into the Langfjorden about west of Tjelle, Norway, between Tjelle and Gramsgrø. The slide generated three megatsunamis in the Langfjorden and the Eresfjorden with heights of . The waves flooded the shore for inland in some areas, destroying farms and other inhabited areas. Damaging waves struck as far away as Veøy, from the landslide – where they washed inland above normal flood levels – and Gjermundnes, from the slide. The waves killed 32 people and destroyed 168 buildings, 196 boats, large amounts of forest, and roads and boat landings.

==== 1792: Mount Unzen, Japan ====

On 21 May 1792, a flank of the Mayamaya dome of Mount Unzen collapsed after two large earthquakes. This had been preceded by a series of earthquakes coming from the mountain, beginning near the end of 1791. Initial wave heights were , but when they hit the other side of Ariake Bay, they were only in height, though one location received waves due to seafloor topography. The waves bounced back to Shimabara, which, when they hit, accounted for about half of the tsunami&#x27;s victims. According to estimates, 10,000 people were killed by the tsunami, and a further 5,000 were killed by the landslide. As of 2011, it was the deadliest known volcanic event in Japan.

==== 1853–1854: Lituya Bay, Alaska ====
Sometime between August 1853 and May 1854, a megatsunami occurred in Lituya Bay in what was then Russian America. Studies of Lituya Bay between 1948 and 1953 first identified the event, which probably occurred because of a large landslide on the south shore of the bay near Mudslide Creek. The wave had a maximum run-up height of , flooding the coast of the bay up to inland.

==== 1874: Lituya Bay, Alaska ====
A study of Lituya Bay in 1953 concluded that sometime around 1874, perhaps in May 1874, another megatsunami occurred in Lituya Bay in Alaska. Probably occurring because of a large landslide on the south shore of the bay in the Mudslide Creek Valley, the wave had a maximum run-up height of , flooding the coast of the bay up to inland.

==== 1883: Krakatoa, Sunda Strait ====

The massive explosion of Krakatoa created pyroclastic flows which generated megatsunamis when they hit the waters of the Sunda Strait on 27 August 1883. The waves reached heights of up to 24 metres (79 feet) along the south coast of Sumatra and up to 42 metres (138 feet) along the west coast of Java. The tsunamis were powerful enough to kill over 30,000 people, and their effect was such that an area of land in Banten had its human settlements wiped out, and they never repopulated. (This area rewilded and was later declared a national park.) The steamship &quot;Berouw&quot;, a colonial gunboat, was flung over a mile (1.6 km) inland on Sumatra by the wave, killing its entire crew. Two thirds of the island collapsed into the sea after the event. Groups of human skeletons were found floating on pumice numerous times, up to a year after the event. The eruption also generated what is often called the loudest sound in history, which was heard away on Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.

==== 1905: Lovatnet, Norway ====
On 15 January 1905, a landslide on the slope of the mountain Ramnefjellet with a volume of fell from a height of into the southern end of the lake Lovatnet in Norway, generating three megatsunamis of up to in height. The waves destroyed the villages of Bødal and Nesdal near the southern end of the lake, killing 61 people – half their combined population – and 261 farm animals and destroying 60 houses, all the local boathouses, and 70 to 80 boats, one of which – the tourist boat &quot;Lodalen&quot; – was thrown inland by the last wave and wrecked. At the northern end of the long lake, a wave measured at almost destroyed a bridge.

==== 1905: Disenchantment Bay, Alaska ====
On 4 July 1905, an overhanging glacier – since known as the Fallen Glacier – broke loose, slid out of its valley, and fell down a steep slope into Disenchantment Bay in Alaska, clearing vegetation along a path wide. When it entered the water, it generated a megatsunami which broke tree branches above ground level away. The wave killed vegetation to a height of at a distance of from the landslide, and it reached heights of at different locations on the coast of Haenke Island. At a distance of from the slide, observers at Russell Fjord reported a series of large waves that caused the water level to rise and fall for a half-hour.

==== 1934: Tafjorden, Norway ====
On 7 April 1934, a landslide on the slope of the mountain Langhamaren with a volume of fell from a height of about into the Tafjorden in Norway, generating three megatsunamis, the last and largest of which reached a height of between on the opposite shore. Large waves struck Tafjord and Fjørå. At Tafjord, the last and largest wave was tall and struck at an estimated speed of , flooding the town for inland and killing 23 people. At Fjørå, waves reached , destroyed buildings, removed all soil, and killed 17 people. Damaging waves struck as far as away, and waves were detected at a distance of from the landslide. One survivor suffered serious injuries requiring hospitalization.

==== 1936: Lovatnet, Norway ====
On 13 September 1936, a landslide on the slope of the mountain Ramnefjellet with a volume of fell from a height of into the southern end of the lake Lovatnet in Norway, generating three megatsunamis, the largest of which reached a height of . The waves destroyed all farms at Bødal and most farms at Nesdal – completely washing away 16 farms – as well as 100 houses, bridges, a power station, a workshop, a sawmill, several grain mills, a restaurant, a schoolhouse, and all boats on the lake. A wave struck the southern end of the long lake and caused damaging flooding in the Loelva River, the lake&#x27;s northern outlet. The waves killed 74 people and severely injured 11.

==== 1936: Lituya Bay, Alaska ====
On 27 October 1936, a megatsunami occurred in Lituya Bay in Alaska with a maximum run-up height of in Crillon Inlet at the head of the bay. The four eyewitnesses to the wave in Lituya Bay itself all survived and described it as between high. The maximum inundation distance was inland along the north shore of the bay. The cause of the megatsunami remains unclear, but may have been a submarine landslide.

==== 1958: Lituya Bay, Alaska, US ====

On 9 July 1958, a giant landslide at the head of Lituya Bay in Alaska, caused by an earthquake, generated a wave that washed out trees to a maximum elevation of at the entrance of Gilbert Inlet. The wave surged over the headland, stripping trees and soil down to bedrock, and surged along the fjord which forms Lituya Bay, destroying two fishing boats anchored there and killing two people. This was the highest wave of any kind ever recorded. The subsequent study of this event led to the establishment of the term &quot;megatsunami,&quot; to distinguish it from ordinary tsunamis.

==== 1963: Vajont Dam, Italy ====

On 9 October 1963, a landslide above Vajont Dam in Italy produced a surge that overtopped the dam and destroyed the villages of Longarone, Pirago, Rivalta, Villanova, and Faè, killing nearly 2,000 people. This is currently the only known example of a megatsunami that was indirectly caused by human activities.

==== 1964: Valdez Arm, Alaska ====
On 27 March 1964, the 1964 Alaska earthquake triggered a landslide that generated a megatsunami which reached a height of in the Valdez Arm of Prince William Sound in Southcentral Alaska.

==== 1980: Spirit Lake, Washington, US ====

On 18 May 1980, the upper of Mount St. Helens collapsed, creating a landslide. This released the pressure on the magma trapped beneath the summit bulge which exploded as a lateral blast, which then released the pressure on the magma chamber and resulted in a plinian eruption.

One lobe of the avalanche surged onto Spirit Lake, causing a megatsunami which pushed the lake waters in a series of surges, which reached a maximum height of above the pre-eruption water level (about ASL). Above the upper limit of the tsunami, trees lie where they were knocked down by the pyroclastic surge; below the limit, the fallen trees and the surge deposits were removed by the megatsunami and deposited in Spirit Lake.

==== 2000: Paatuut, Greenland ====
On 21 November 2000, a landslide composed of of rock with a mass of 260,000,000 tons fell from an elevation of at Paatuut on the Nuussuaq Peninsula on the west coast of Greenland, reaching a speed of . About of material with a mass of 87,000,000 tons entered Sullorsuaq Strait (known in Danish as Vaigat Strait), generating a megatsunami. The wave had a run-up height of near the landslide and at Qullissat, the site of an abandoned settlement across the strait on Disko Island, away, where it inundated the coast as far as inland. Refracted energy from the tsunami created a wave that destroyed boats at the closest populated village, Saqqaq, on the southwestern coast of the Nuussuaq Peninsula from the landslide.

==== 2007: Chehalis Lake, British Columbia, Canada ====
On 4 December 2007, a landslide composed of of rock and debris fell from an elevation of on the slope of Mount Orrock on the western short of Chehalis Lake. The landslide entered the deep lake, generating a megatsunamii with a run-up height of on the opposite shore and at the lake&#x27;s exit point away to the south. The wave then continued down the Chehalis River for about .

==== 2015: Taan Fiord, Alaska, US ====

At 8:19 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time on 17 October 2015, the side of a mountain collapsed at the head of Taan Fiord, a finger of Icy Bay in Alaska. Some of the resulting landslide came to rest on the toe of Tyndall Glacier, but about of rock with a volume of about fell into the fjord. The landslide generated a megatsunami with an initial height of about that struck the opposite shore of the fjord, with a run-up height there of .

Over the next 12 minutes, the wave travelled down the fjord at a speed of up to , with run-up heights of over in the upper fjord to between or more in its middle section, and or more at its mouth. Still probably tall when it entered Icy Bay, the tsunami inundated parts of Icy Bay&#x27;s shoreline with run-ups of before dissipating into insignificance at distances of from the mouth of Taan Fiord, although the wave was detected away.

Occurring in an uninhabited area, the event was unwitnessed, and several hours passed before the signature of the landslide was noticed on seismographs at Columbia University in New York City.

==== 2017: Karrat Fjord, Greenland ====
On 17 June 2017, of rock on the mountain Ummiammakku fell from an elevation of roughly into the waters of the Karrat Fjord. The event was thought to be caused by melting ice that destabilised the rock. It registered as a magnitude 4.1 earthquake and created a wave. The settlement of Nuugaatsiaq, away, saw run-up heights of . Eleven buildings were swept into the sea, four people died, and 170 residents of Nuugaatsiaq and Illorsuit were evacuated because of a danger of additional landslides and waves. The tsunami was noted at settlements as far as away.

==== 2020: Elliot Creek, British Columbia, Canada ====
On 28 November 2020, unseasonably heavy rainfall triggered a landslide of into a glacial lake at the head of Elliot Creek. The sudden displacement of water generated a high megatsunami that cascaded down Elliot Creek and the Southgate River to the head of Bute Inlet, covering a total distance of over . The event generated a magnitude 5.0 earthquake and destroyed over of salmon habitat along Elliot Creek.

====2023: Dickson Fjord, Greenland====
On 16 September 2023 a large landslide originating above sea level entered Dickson Fjord, triggering a tsunami exceeding in run-up. Run-up of was observed along a stretch of coast. There was no major damage and there were no casualties. The tsunami was followed by a seiche that lasted for a week. The seiche produced a nine-day disturbance recorded by seismic instruments globally.

== Potential future megatsunamis ==
In a BBC television documentary broadcast in 2000, experts said that they thought that a landslide on a volcanic ocean island is the most likely future cause of a megatsunami. The size and power of a wave generated by such means could produce devastating effects, travelling across oceans and inundating up to inland from the coast. This research was later found to be flawed. The documentary was produced before the experts&#x27; scientific paper was published and before responses were given by other geologists. There have been megatsunamis in the past, and future megatsunamis are possible but current geological consensus is that these are only local. A megatsunami in the Canary Islands would diminish to a normal tsunami by the time it reached the continents. Also, the current consensus for La Palma is that the region conjectured to collapse is too small and too geologically stable to do so in the next 10,000 years, although there is evidence for past megatsunamis local to the Canary Islands thousands of years ago. Similar remarks apply to the suggestion of a megatsunami in Hawaii.

=== British Columbia ===
Some geologists consider an unstable rock face at Mount Breakenridge, above the north end of the giant fresh-water fjord of Harrison Lake in the Fraser Valley of southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to be unstable enough to collapse into the lake, generating a megatsunami that might destroy the town of Harrison Hot Springs (located at its south end).

=== Canary Islands ===
Geologists Dr. Simon Day and Dr. Steven Neal Ward consider that a megatsunami could be generated during an eruption of Cumbre Vieja on the volcanic ocean island of La Palma, in the Canary Islands, Spain. Day and Ward hypothesize that if such an eruption causes the western flank to fail, a megatsunami could be generated.

In 1949, an eruption occurred at three of the volcano&#x27;s ventsDuraznero, Hoyo Negro, and Llano del Banco. A local geologist, Juan Bonelli-Rubio, witnessed the eruption and recorded details on various phenomenon related to the eruption. Bonelli-Rubio visited the summit area of the volcano and found that a fissure about long had opened on the east side of the summit. As a result, the western half of the volcanowhich is the volcanically active arm of a triple-armed rifthad slipped approximately downwards and westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean.

In 1971, an eruption occurred at the Teneguía vent at the southern end of the sub-aerial section of the volcano without any movement. The section affected by the 1949 eruption is currently stationary and does not appear to have moved since the initial rupture.

Cumbre Vieja remained dormant until an eruption began on 19 September 2021.

It is likely that several eruptions would be required before failure would occur on Cumbre Vieja. The western half of the volcano has an approximate volume of and an estimated mass of . If it were to catastrophically slide into the ocean, it could generate a wave with an initial height of about at the island, and a likely height of around at the Caribbean and the Eastern North American seaboard when it runs ashore eight or more hours later. Tens of millions of lives could be lost in the cities and/or towns of St. John&#x27;s, Halifax, Boston, New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Miami, Havana and the rest of the eastern coasts of the United States and Canada, as well as many other cities on the Atlantic coast in Europe, South America and Africa. The likelihood of this happening is a matter of vigorous debate.

Geologists and volcanologists are in general agreement that the initial study was flawed. The current geology does not suggest that a collapse is imminent. Indeed, it seems to be geologically impossible right nowthe region conjectured as prone to collapse is too small and too stable to collapse within the next 10,000 years. A closer study of deposits left in the ocean from previous landslides suggests that a landslide would likely occur as a series of smaller collapses rather than a single landslide. A megatsunami does seem possible locally in the distant future as there is geological evidence from past deposits suggesting that a megatsunami occurred with marine material deposited above sea level between 32,000 and 1.75 million years ago. This seems to have been local to Gran Canaria.

Day and Ward have admitted that their original analysis of the danger was based on several worst case assumptions. A 2008 study examined this scenario and concluded that while it could cause a megatsunami, it would be local to the Canary Islands and would diminish in height, becoming a smaller tsunami by the time it reached the continents as the waves interfered and spread across the oceans.

=== Hawaii ===
Sharp cliffs and associated ocean debris at the Kohala Volcano, Lanai and Molokai indicate that landslides from the flank of the Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes in Hawaii may have triggered past megatsunamis, most recently at 120,000 BP. A tsunami event is also possible, with the tsunami potentially reaching up to about in height According to the documentary &quot;National Geographic&#x27;s Ultimate Disaster: Tsunami&quot;, if a big landslide occurred at Mauna Loa or the Hilina Slump, a tsunami would take only thirty minutes to reach Honolulu. There, hundreds of thousands of people could be killed as the tsunami could level Honolulu and travel inland. Also, the West Coast of America and the entire Pacific Rim could potentially be affected.

Other research suggests that such a single large landslide is not likely. Instead, it would collapse as a series of smaller landslides.

In 2018, shortly after the beginning of the 2018 lower Puna eruption, a National Geographic article responded to such claims with &quot;Will a monstrous landslide off the side of Kilauea trigger a monster tsunami bound for California? Short answer: No.&quot;

In the same article, geologist Mika McKinnon stated:

Another volcanologist, Janine Krippner, added:

Despite this, evidence suggests that catastrophic collapses do occur on Hawaiian volcanoes and generate local tsunamis.

=== Norway ===

Although known earlier to the local population, a crack wide and in length in the side of the mountain Åkerneset in Norway was rediscovered in 1983 and attracted scientific attention. It since has widened at a rate of per year. Geological analysis has revealed that a slab of rock thick and at an elevation stretching from is in motion. Geologists assess that an eventual catastrophic collapse of of rock into Sunnylvsfjorden is inevitable and could generate megatsunamis of in height on the fjord′s opposite shore. The waves are expected to strike Hellesylt with a height of , Geiranger with a height of , Tafjord with a height of , and many other communities in Norway&#x27;s Sunnmøre district with a height of several metres, and to be noticeable even at Ålesund. The predicted disaster is depicted in the 2015 Norwegian film &quot;The Wave&quot;.

<text>A maritime nation is any nation that borders the sea and is dependent on its use for the majority of the following state activities: commerce and transport, war, to define a territorial boundary, or for any maritime activity (activities using the sea to convey or produce an end result).

Historically, the term has been used to refer to a thalassocracy such as Carthage and Phoenicia but during the medieval period increasingly became associated with the Maritime Republics of Venice, Pisa, Genoa, Amalfi, Gaeta, Ancona and Ragusa.

The interests of a modern maritime state can be in conflict with those of the coastal states that do not depend on the sea trade routes in a major way. For example, when the marine pollution is concerned, the coastal states seek to protect their shores and waters, while the maritime nations are concerned with limits the protective regulations place onto the freedom of navigation. Many states have both maritime and coastal interests, so the groups of coastal and maritime states intersect to a large degree.

<text>Pornographic films (pornos), erotic films, adult films, blue films, sex films, or 18+ films, are films that represent sexually subject matter in order to arouse, fascinate, or satisfy the viewer. Pornographic films represent sexual fantasies and usually include erotically stimulating material such as nudity (softcore) and sexual intercourse (hardcore). A distinction is sometimes made between &quot;erotic&quot; and &quot;pornographic&quot; films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit sexuality, and focuses more on arousal than storytelling; the distinction is highly subjective.

Pornographic films are produced and distributed on a variety of media, depending on the demand and technology available, including traditional film stock footage in various formats, home video, DVDs, mobile devices, Internet pornography Internet download, cable TV, in addition to other media. Pornography is often sold or rented on DVD; shown through Internet streaming, specialty channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite; and viewed in rapidly disappearing adult theaters. Often due to broadcast or print censorship commissions; general public opinion; public decency laws; or religious pressure groups; overly sexualized content is generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream media, or on free-to-air television.

Films with content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s. Production of such films was profitable, and a number of producers began to specialize in their production. Various groups within society considered such depictions immoral, labeled them &quot;pornographic&quot;, and attempted to have them suppressed under other obscenity laws, with varying degrees of success. Such films continued to be produced, and could only be distributed by underground channels. Because the viewing of such films carried a social stigma, they were viewed at brothels, adult movie theaters, stag parties, home, private clubs, and night cinemas.

In the 1970s, during the Golden Age of Porn, pornographic films were semi-legitimized, to the point where actors not known for appearances in such productions would be cast members (though rarely participating in the explicit scenes); by the 1980s, pornography on home video achieved wider distribution. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s changed the way pornographic films were distributed, complicating censorship regimes around the world and legal prosecutions of &quot;obscenity&quot;.

==Classification==
Pornographic films are typically categorized as either softcore or hardcore pornography. In general, softcore pornography is pornography that does not depict explicit sexual activity, sexual penetration or extreme fetishism. It generally contains nudity or partial nudity in sexually suggestive situations. Hardcore pornography is pornography that depicts penetration or extreme fetish acts, or both. It contains graphic sexual activity and visible penetration. A pornographic work is characterized as hardcore if it has any hardcore content.

Pornographic films are generally classified into subgenres which describe the underlying theme or sexual fantasy which the film and actors attempt to create. Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the market to which each subgenre appeals. The subgenres usually conform to certain conventions, and each may appeal to a particular audience.

==History==
=== Early years: before 1920 ===

Production of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen Eugène Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner, under the name &quot;Léar&quot;, directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film had performing a bathroom striptease. Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqué films, showing women disrobing.

Also in 1896. was released as a short nickelodeon kinetoscope/film featuring a gyrating belly dancer named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risque films that featured exotic dancers. In the same year, &quot;The May Irwin Kiss&quot; contained the first kiss on film. It was a 47-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips (&quot;the mysteries of the kiss revealed&quot;). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and obscene to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform, because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution. Perhaps in defiance and &quot;to spice up a film&quot;, this was followed by many kiss imitators, including &quot;The Kiss in the Tunnel&quot; (1899) and &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1900). A tableau vivant style was used in short film &quot;&quot; (1901) featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored body stocking in a direct frontal pose that provides a provocative view of the female body. The pose is in the style of Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;.

In Austria, cinemas organised men-only nights (called ) at which adult films were shown. Johann Schwarzer formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at those screenings. Before Schwarzer&#x27;s productions, erotic films were provided by the Pathé brothers from French produced sources. In 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities which destroyed all the films they could find, though some have since resurfaced from private collections. There were a number of American films in the 1910s which featured female nudity.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Argentina may have been the first center of pornographic film production in the world. It is considered that the porn film was born in France practically at the same time as the cinematographic medium, but it was in Buenos Aires where the clandestine production of these films, known as stag films or smokers, was capitalized. Around 1905, Pathé and Gaumont moved the production of porn to Argentina to avoid censorship by the French government. These films were not intended for local or popular consumption, but were &quot;sophisticated entertainment for the enjoyment of the well-to-do class of [Europe].&quot; Writing about the origins of underground cinema, Arthur Knight and Hollis Alpert explain that hardcore films were shipped by boat from Argentina to private buyers, mostly in France and England, but also in more distant places such as Russia and the Balkans. In &quot;Black and White and Blue&quot; (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine &#x27;stag film&#x27; trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by the turn of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years. In his biography of Eugene O&#x27;Neill, Louis Sheaffer recounts that the playwright traveled to Buenos Aires in the 1900s and was a frequent visitor to the pornographic cinemas in the Barracas neighborhood. The Argentine film &quot;El Sartorio&quot; (also known as &quot;El Satario&quot;) is perhaps the oldest known pornographic film, a theory held by several authors. Filmed between 1907 and 1912 on the riverside of Quilmes or Rosario, the film depicts six nude nymphs who are surprised by a satyr or faun, who captures one of them and then has sex in a variety of positions, including the 69. &quot;El Sartorio&quot; is held currently in the Kinsey Institute&#x27;s film archive, the largest collection of stag films in the world.

Because Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. According to Patrick Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Film Facts&quot;, &quot;the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is &quot; made in France in 1908. The plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. He also notes that &quot;the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America&#x27;s Kinsey Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film (1910) is a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man in the missionary position, fellatio, and penile anal penetration.&quot;

===1920s–1940s suppression===

Pornographic movies were widespread in the silent movie era of the 1920s, and were often shown in brothels. Soon illegal, stag films, or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their bathtubs to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesmen, but anyone caught viewing or possessing them risked a prison sentence.

===1950s: home movies ===
The post-war era saw technological developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market and amateur film-making, particularly the introduction of the 8 mm and super-8 film gauges, popular for the home movie market.

Entrepreneurs emerged to meet the demand. In Britain, in the 1950s, Harrison Marks produced films which were considered risqué, and which today would be described as &quot;soft core&quot;. In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films for the 8mm market of his models undressing and posing topless, popularly known as &quot;glamour home movies&quot;. To Marks, the term &quot;glamour&quot; was a euphemism for nude modeling/photography.

===1960s: Europe and United States===

Starting in 1961, Lasse Braun was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father&#x27;s diplomatic privileges. Braun was able to accumulate funds for his lavish productions from the profit gained with so-called loops, ten-minute hardcore movies which he sold to Reuben Sturman, who distributed them to 60,000 American peep show booths. Braun was always on the move, and made his hardcore movies in a number of countries, including Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.

In December 1960, American female director Doris Wishman began producing a series of eight pornographic films, or nudist films without sex scenes, including &quot;Hideout in the Sun&quot; (1960), &quot;Nude on the Moon&quot; (1961) and &quot;Diary of a Nudist&quot; (1961). She also produced a series of sexploitation films.

In the 1960s, social and judicial attitudes towards the explicit depiction of sexuality began to change. For example, Swedish film &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot; (1967) included numerous frank nude scenes and simulated sexual intercourse. In one particularly controversial scene, Lena kisses her lover&#x27;s flaccid penis. The film was exhibited in mainstream cinemas, but in 1969 it was banned in Massachusetts allegedly for being pornographic. The ban was challenged in the courts, with the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately declaring that the film was not obscene, paving the way for other sexually explicit films. Another Swedish film &quot;Language of Love&quot; (1969) was also sexually explicit, but was framed as a quasi-documentary sex educational film, which made its legal status uncertain though controversial.

In 1969, Denmark became the first country to abolish all censorship laws, enabling pornography, including hardcore pornography. The example was followed by toleration in the Netherlands, also in 1969. There was an explosion of pornography commercially produced in those countries, including, at the very beginning, child pornography and bestiality porn. Now that being a pornographer was legal, there was no shortage of businessmen who invested in plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, needed to be smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold &quot;under the counter&quot; or (sometimes) shown in &quot;members only&quot; cinema clubs.

In the United States, producers of pornographic films formed the Adult Film Association of America in 1969, after the release of &quot;Blue Movie&quot; by Andy Warhol, to fight against censorship, and to defend the industry against obscenity charges.

===1970s: adult theaters and movie booths in the United States ===
In the 1970s, there was a more tolerant judicial attitude to non-mainstream films. Mainstream theatres did not usually screen even softcore films, leading to a rise of adult theaters in the United States and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated &quot;movie booths&quot; in sex shops that displayed pornographic &quot;loops&quot; (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).

Denmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as &quot;Bordellet&quot; (1972), the &quot;Bedside&quot;-films (1970–1976) and the &quot;Zodiac&quot;-films (1973–1978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as &quot;porno films&quot; though all except the early &quot;Bedside&quot;-films included hardcore pornographic scenes. Several of these films still rank among the most seen films in Danish film history and all remain favourites on home video.

In 1969, &quot;Blue Movie&quot; by Andy Warhol was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. The film was a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn and, according to Warhol, a major influence in the making of &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after &quot;Blue Movie&quot; was made.

The first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be &quot;Mona the Virgin Nymph&quot; (also known as &quot;Mona&quot;), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco, who created the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) 1974 cult film &quot;Flesh Gordon&quot; and later, in 1976, the X-rated musical-comedy film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

The 1971 film &quot;Boys in the Sand&quot; represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;), and, after the 1969 film &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, one of the first to be reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Other notable American hardcore feature films of the 1970s include &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (1972), &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; (1972), &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; (1973), Radley Metzger&#x27;s &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; (1976) and &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; (1978). These were shot on film and screened in mainstream movie theaters. In Britain, &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was not approved in its uncut form until 2000 and not shown publicly until June 2005.

In the U.S. &quot;Miller v. California&quot; was an important court case in 1973. The case established that obscenity was not legally protected, but the case also established the Miller test, a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to indecency (which may or may not be legal).

===1980s: new technology and new legal cases===
With the arrival of the home video cassette recorder in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like Traci Lords, Seka, Christy Canyon, Ginger Lynn, Nina Hartley, and directors such as Gregory Dark. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of videotape. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because videotape produced a different image quality. Those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry&#x27;s profits, since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realized that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people&#x27;s homes. This marked the end of the age of big-budget productions, and the beginning of the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover nearly every fetish possible, since the production of pornography was now inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands were being made, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos. One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one&#x27;s own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.

Similarly, the camcorder spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.

The &quot;de facto&quot; result of the 1987 legal case California v. Freeman effectively legalized hardcore pornography in the U.S.. The prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases to effectively outlaw the production of such movies.

===1990s: DVD and the Internet age===

In the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on DVD. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format (videotape) and allowed innovations such as &quot;interactive&quot; videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.

The introduction and widespread availability of the Internet further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously, videos were ordered from an adult bookstore or through mail-order; with the Internet, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).

Pornography can be distributed over the Internet in a number of ways, including paysites, video hosting services and peer-to-peer file sharing. While pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991, as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time, led to an explosion in online pornography.

Viv Thomas, Paul Thomas, Andrew Blake, Antonio Adamo, and Rocco Siffredi were prominent directors of pornographic films in the 1990s. In 1998, the Danish, Oscar-nominated film production company Zentropa became the world&#x27;s first mainstream film company to openly produce hardcore pornographic films, starting with &quot;Constance&quot; (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced &quot;Idioterne&quot; (1998), directed by Lars von Trier, which won many international awards and was nominated for a Golden Palm in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). &quot;Idioterne&quot; started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as Catherine Breillat&#x27;s &quot;Romance&quot;, which starred pornstar Rocco Siffredi.

In 1999, the Danish TV channel Kanal København started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any viewer in the Copenhagen area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of Innocent Pictures, a company started by Zentropa).

Once people could watch adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, a new adult market developed that far exceeded the scope of its theater-centric predecessor. The Internet served as catalyst for creating a still-larger market for porn, a market that is even less traditionally theatrical.

By the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. The market was further expanded by webcams and webcam recordings, in which thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers&#x27; demand.

===2000s to present: competition and contraction===
By the 2000s, the fortunes of the pornography industry had changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by streaming media delivery over the Internet, competition from bootleg, amateur and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size. At the same time this gave rise to video sharing platforms such as Pornhub, XVideos and xHamster.

==Pornographic film industry==

===Economics===
Globally, pornography is a large-scale business with revenues of nearly $100 billion, which includes the production of various media and associated products and services. The industry employs thousands of performers along with support and production staff. It is also followed by dedicated industry publications and trade groups as well as the mainstream press, private organizations (watchdog groups), government agencies, and political organizations. According to a 2005 Reuters article, &quot;The multi-billion-dollar industry releases about 11,000 titles on DVD each year.&quot; Pornographic films can be sold or rented out on DVD, shown through Internet and special channels and pay-per-view on cable and satellite, and in adult theaters. However, by 2012, widespread availability of illegally copied content and other low-cost competition on the Internet had made the pornographic film industry smaller and reduced profitability.

The global pornographic film industry is dominated by the United States, with the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles being the heart of the industry.

In 1975, the total retail value of all the hardcore pornography in the United States was estimated at $5–10 million. The 1979, Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that &quot;in Los Angeles alone, the porno business does $100 million a year in gross retain volume.&quot; According to the 1986 Attorney General&#x27;s Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine.

 the total current income of the country&#x27;s adult entertainment is often estimated at $10–13 billion, of which $4–6 billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by Forrester Research and was lowered in 1998. In 2007 &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper also gave a figure of $13 billion. Other sources, quoted by Forbes (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, and IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, websites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys, and magazines) mention the $2.6–3.9 billion figure (without the cellphone component). &quot;USA Today&quot; claimed in 2003 that websites such as Danni&#x27;s Hard Drive and Cybererotica.com generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time. The adult movies income (from sale and rent) was once estimated by AVN Publications at $4.3 billion but the figure obtaining is unclear. According to the 2001 &quot;Forbes&quot; data, the annual income distribution is the following:
&quot;The Online Journalism Review&quot;, published by the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California, weighed in with an analysis that favored &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; number. The financial extent of adult films, distributed in hotels, is hard to estimate—hotels keep statistics to themselves or do not keep them at all.

The world&#x27;s largest adult movie studio Vivid Entertainment generates an estimated $100 million a year in revenue, distributing 60 films annually, and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems, and on the Internet. The Spanish-based studio Private Media Group was listed on the NASDAQ until November 2011. Video rentals soared from just under 80 million in 1985 to a half-billion by 1993. Some subsidiaries of major corporations are the largest pornography sellers, like News Corporation&#x27;s DirecTV. Comcast, the nation&#x27;s largest cable company, once pulled in $50 million from adult programming. Revenues of companies such as &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Hustler&quot; were small by comparison.

=== Production ===

Pornographic films are produced and directed at a target audience, who buy and view the films. Traditionally, the audience of pornographic films have been straight males, the male actor typically acted as a proxy for the viewer. A typical pornographic film focuses on a female performer, her male partner traditionally had no distinctive features. However, there has been an increase in female viewers over time, and there have recently been efforts to increase the sexualization of male performers also. Efforts such as, men with charming facial features and well-built bodies becoming predominant in pornographic films, as well as the emergence of feminist pornography. Overtime a gay audience also developed, and the scenarios of the films adjust accordingly.

Pornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create that fantasy. The physical features of the actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is the main factor in who is cast in certain roles. Most actors specialize in certain genres.

Within the average film targeted at a heterosexual male audience, the primary focus is on the sexually attractive appearance of female actress or actresses, meanwhile most male performers in heterosexual pornography are selected less for their looks and more so for their sexual prowess. They are presented as being able to fulfill the proxy fantasy of the male watching audience.

===Legal status===

In the United States, the Supreme Court held in 1969 that State laws making mere private possession of obscene material a crime are invalid. Further attempts were made in the 1970s in the United States to close down the pornography industry, this time by prosecuting those in the industry on prostitution charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of &quot;People v. Freeman&quot;. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely &quot;portraying&quot; a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the United States Supreme Court making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.

At present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka &quot;Ray Guhn&quot;, was indicted on charges of &quot;soliciting and engaging in prostitution&quot; for his creation of pornography films which included &quot;McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.&quot; The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states&#x27; local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.

In some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California&#x27;s &quot;Freeman&quot; decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of Texas whose prostitution law specifically states:

:An offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.

In the United States, federal law prohibits the sale, distribution or dissemination of obscene materials through the mail, over the broadcast airwaves, on cable or satellite TV, on the Internet, over the telephone or by any other means that cross state lines. Most states also have specific laws banning the sale or distribution of obscene pornography within state borders. The only protection for obscene material recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States is personal possession in the home (&quot;Stanley v. Georgia&quot;).

The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed in &quot;Miller v. California&quot; that obscenity was not protected speech. Further, the court ruled that each community is responsible for setting its own standards about what is considered to be obscene material. If pornographic material is prosecuted and brought to trial, a jury can deem it obscene based on:
# whether &quot;the average person, applying contemporary community standards&quot; would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest
# whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law and
# whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

In many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce, but there are some restrictions. Pornography is also banned in some countries, in particular in the Muslim world and China, but can be accessed through the Internet in some of these nations.

=== Health issues ===
Sex acts in pornographic films have traditionally been performed without the use of condoms, with an accompanying risk of sexually transmitted disease among performers. In 1986, there was an outbreak of HIV infection which led to the deaths through AIDS of several actors and actresses. This led to the creation in 1998 of the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation (AIM), which helped set up a monitoring system in the U.S. pornographic film industry, which required pornographic film actors to be tested for HIV every 30 days. , HIV infection of performers in the U.S. pornography industry has been rare, with only a few outbreaks being recorded over the subsequent three decades. The AIM closed its doors in May 2011 and filed for bankruptcy as a result of a court case arising from an inadvertent leak by it of confidential information on clients, including names and STD results.
