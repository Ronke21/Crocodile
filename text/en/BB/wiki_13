<text>Within the realm of communication studies, organizational communication is a field of study surrounding all areas of communication and information flow that contribute to the functioning of an organization . Organizational communication is constantly evolving and as a result, the scope of organizations included in this field of research have also shifted over time. Now both traditionally profitable companies, as well as NGO&#x27;s and non-profit 
organizations, are points of interest for scholars focused on the field of organizational communication. Organizations are formed and sustained through continuous communication between members of the organization and both internal and external sub-groups who possess shared objectives for the organization. The flow of communication encompasses internal and external stakeholders and can be formal or informal.

==History==
The field traces its lineage through business information, business communication, and early mass communication studies published in the 1930s through the 1950s. Until then, organizational communication as a discipline consisted of a few professors within speech departments who had a particular interest in speaking and writing in business settings. The current field is established with its own theories and empirical concerns distinct from other fields.

Several seminal publications stand out as works broadening the scope and recognizing the importance of communication in the organizing process, and in using the term &quot;organizational communication&quot;. Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon wrote in 1947 about &quot;organization communications systems&quot;, saying communication is &quot;absolutely essential to organizations&quot;. W. Charles Redding played a prominent role in the establishment of organizational communication as a discipline.

In the 1950s, organizational communication focused largely on the role of communication in improving organizational life and organizational output. In the 1980s, the field turned away from a business-oriented approach to communication and became concerned more with the constitutive role of communication in organizing. In the 1990s, the rise of critical theory garnered influence within the field as organizational communication scholars focused more on communication&#x27;s ability to both oppress and liberate organizational members.
This shift in thought arose from the French postulations brought about by theorist Michel Foucault. Foucault is often revered as the father of Post-modern thought and has been described as a “radical relativist” by contemporaries such as Camille Paglia.

From the 2000s onward, organizational communications experienced a “discursive turn”. This turn started in the 1980s with the rise of globalization and explains the changed relationship between organizations and governments. After 1980, interpretive and critical organizational communication research expanded rapidly and combined with functionalist research, creating a much more varied and complex landscape. Governments around the world became increasingly interested in multilateral organizations and began supporting their goals and interests; this factor increased the profits for investors who were able to capitalize on the changes occurring. In the early 2000s, organizational communications saw discoveries of illegality and corruption, which led to the bankruptcies of extremely large organizations (Ex. Arthur Anderson). As a result, it changed how people see ethics and corporate social responsibility in organizational communications. Organizational communication became richer and more fragmented as structural-functional perspectives waned. For the future of this field, it is inevitable that diversity will lead to intellectual competition, and that hierarchy will be established among perspectives.

In the most recent history of the last five years, organizational communications have seen huge differences in how public opinion sees mass media. This shift has led to began to move away from traditional news sources like the newspaper and rely more on social media like Twitter for their news sources. With this change, communication is more vulnerable to things like “fake news”; however, it gives all members of the public the capability of sharing their stories. With the rapid advancement of technology, there is no telling how far the field of organizational communications will advance in years to come.

==Early underlying assumptions==

Some of the main assumptions underlying much of the early organizational communication research were:

* Humans act rationally. Some people do not behave in rational ways, they generally don&#x27;t have access to all of the information needed to make rational decisions they could articulate, and therefore will make irrational decisions, unless there is some breakdown in the communication process—which is common. Irrational people rationalize how they will rationalize their communication measures whether or not it is rational.
* Formal logic and empirically verifiable data ought to be the foundation upon which any theory should rest. All we really need to understand communication in organizations is (a) observable and replicable behaviors that can be transformed into variables by some form of measurement, and (b) formally replicable syllogisms that can extend theory from observed data to other groups and settings
* Communication is primarily a mechanical process, in which a message is constructed and encoded by a sender, transmitted through some channel, then received and decoded by a receiver. Distortion, represented as any differences between the original and the received messages, can and ought to be identified and reduced or eliminated.
* Organizations are mechanical things, in which the parts (including employees functioning in defined roles) are interchangeable. What works in one organization will work in another similar organization. Individual differences can be minimized or even eliminated with careful management techniques.
* Organizations function as a container within which communication takes place. Any differences in form or function of communication between that occurring in an organization and in another setting can be identified and studied as factors affecting the communicative activity.

Herbert A. Simon introduced the concept of &quot;bounded rationality&quot; which challenged assumptions about the perfect rationality of communication participants. He maintained that people making decisions in organizations seldom had complete information, and that even if more information was available, they tended to pick the first acceptable option, rather than exploring further to pick the optimal solution.

In the early 1990s Peter Senge developed new theories on organizational communication. These theories were learning organization and systems thinking. These have been well received and are now a mainstay in current beliefs toward organizational communications.

Robert Craig suggested that there were seven components of communication theory ,seven different ways of thinking about how communication works in the world. The seven different domains are rhetorical, semiotic, phenomenological, cybernetic, sociopsychological, sociocultural and critical. The rhetorical approach can be theorized as the practical art of discourse and the semiotic approach theorized as intersubjective mediation by signs. The phenomenological approach can be theorized as experiences of otherness; dialogue, and the cybernetic approach as information processing. The socialpsychological approach can be theorized as expression, interaction and influence. The sociocultural approach is theorized as (Re)production of social order and the critical approach theorized as discursive reflection.

===Communication networks===

Networks are another aspect of direction and flow of communication. Bavelas has shown that communication patterns, or networks, influence groups in several important ways. Communication networks may affect the group&#x27;s completion of the assigned task on time, the position of the de facto leader in the group, or they may affect the group members&#x27; satisfaction from occupying certain positions in the network. Although these findings are based on laboratory experiments, they have important implications for the dynamics of communication in formal organizations.

There are several patterns of communication, such as &quot;chain&quot;, &quot;wheel&quot;, &quot;star&quot;, &quot;all-channel&quot; network, and &quot;circle&quot;.

==Interorganization communication==

===Flow nomenclature===
Abbreviations are used to indicate the two-way flow of information or other transactions, e.g. &quot;B2B&quot; is &quot;business to business&quot;. Duplex point-to-point communication systems, computer networks, non-electronic telecommunications, and meetings in person are all possible with the use of these terms. Examples:
==Interpersonal communication==

Interpersonal communication amongst individuals can be expressed both verbally and non-verbally, such as through the use of gestures, facial expressions, and overall body language.

Managers do not need answers to operate a successful business; they need questions. Answers can come from anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world due to the plethora of electronic communication tools at our disposal. This has turned the real job of management into determining what business specifically needs to know, along with the who/what/where/when and how of learning it. To effectively solve problems, seize opportunities, and achieve objectives, questions need to be asked by managers—these are the people responsible for the operation of the enterprise as a whole.

Ideally, the meanings sent are the meanings received. This is most often the case when the messages concern something that can be verified objectively. For example, &quot;This piece of pipe fits the threads on the coupling.&quot; In this case, the receiver of the message can check the sender&#x27;s words by actual trial, if necessary. However, when the sender&#x27;s words describe a feeling or an opinion about something that cannot be checked objectively, meanings can be very unclear. &quot;This work is too hard&quot; or &quot;Watergate was politically justified&quot; are examples of opinions or feelings that cannot be verified. Thus, they are subject to interpretation and hence to distorted meanings. The receiver&#x27;s background of experience and learning may differ enough from that of the sender to cause significantly different perceptions and evaluations of the topic under discussion. As we shall see later, such differences form a basic barrier to communication.

Nonverbal content always accompanies the verbal content of messages. When speaking about nonverbal communication, Birdwhistell says &quot;it is complementary to (meaning &quot;adds to&quot;) rather than redundant with (or repeating of) the verbal behavior&quot;. For example, if someone is talking about the length of an object, they may hold out their hands to give a visual estimate of it. This is reasonably clear in the case of face-to-face communication. As Virginia Satir has pointed out, people cannot help but communicate symbolically (for example, through their clothing or possessions) or through some form of body language. In messages that are conveyed by the telephone, a messenger, or a letter, the situation or context in which the message is sent becomes part of its non-verbal content. For example, if the company has been losing money, and in a letter to the production division, the front office orders a reorganization of the shipping and receiving departments, this could be construed to mean that some people were going to lose their jobs — unless it were made explicitly clear that this would not occur.

A number of variables influence the effectiveness of communication. Some are found in the environment in which communication takes place, some in the personalities of the sender and the receiver, and some in the relationship that exists between sender and receiver. These different variables suggest some of the difficulties of communicating with understanding between two people. The sender wants to formulate an idea and communicate it to the receiver. This desire to communicate may arise from his thoughts or feelings or it may have been triggered by something in the environment. The communication may also be influenced by the relationship between the sender and the receiver, such as status differences, a staff-line relationship, or a learner-teacher relationship.

Whatever its origin, information travels through a series of filters, both in the sender and in the receiver, and is affected by different channels, before the idea can be transmitted and re-created in the receiver&#x27;s mind. Physical capacities to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch vary between people, so that the image of reality may be distorted even before the mind goes to work. In addition to physical or sense filters, cognitive filters, or the way in which an individual&#x27;s mind interprets the world around him, will influence his assumptions and feelings. These filters will determine what the sender of a message says, how he says it, and with what purpose. Filters are present also in the receiver, creating a double complexity that once led Robert Louis Stevenson to say that human communication is &quot;doubly relative&quot;. It takes one person to say something and another to decide what he said.

Physical and cognitive, including semantic s (which decide the meaning of words) combine to form a part of our memory system that helps us respond to reality. In this sense, March and Simon compare a person to a data processing system. Behavior results from an interaction between a person&#x27;s internal state and environmental stimuli. What we have learned through past experience becomes an inventory, or data bank, consisting of values or goals, sets of expectations and preconceptions about the consequences of acting one way or another, and a variety of possible ways of responding to the situation. This memory system determines what things we will notice and respond to in the environment. At the same time, stimuli in the environment help to determine what parts of the memory system will be activated. Hence, the memory and the environment form an interactive system that causes our behavior. As this interactive system responds to new experiences, new learnings occur which feed back into memory and gradually change its content. This process is how people adapt to a changing world.

==Formal and informal==

Informal and formal communication are used in an organization. Formal communication flows downward, horizontal and upward while informal communication is generally referred to as &quot;the grapevine&quot;.

Formal communication refers to the flow of official information through proper, predefined channels and routes. The flow of information is controlled and needs deliberate effort to be properly communicated. Formal communication follows a hierarchical structure and chain of command. The structure is typically top down, from leaders in various departments and senior staff in the organization, which funnel down to lower level employees.

Informal communication, generally associated with interpersonal, horizontal communication, was primarily seen as a potential hindrance to effective organizational performance. This is no longer the case. Informal communication has become more important to ensuring the effective conduct of work in modern organizations.

Grapevine is a random, unofficial means of informal communication. It spreads through an organization with access to individual interpretation as gossip, rumors, and single-strand messages. Grapevine communication is quick and usually more direct than formal communication. An employee who receives most of the grapevine information but does not pass it onto others is known as a &quot;dead-ender&quot;. An employee that receives less than half of the grapevine information is an &quot;isolate&quot;. Grapevine can include destructive miscommunication, but it can also be beneficial by allowing feelings to be expressed, and increasing the productivity of employees.

Additionally, McPhee and Zaug (1995) take a more nuanced view of communication as constitutive of organizations (also referred to as CCO). They identify four constitutive flows of communication, formal and informal, which become interrelated in order to constitute organizing and an organization:
* organizational self-structuring
* membership negotiation
* activity coordination
* institutional positioning

== Role of organizational communication ==
Organizational communication refers to exchanging and transmitting information between individuals and groups within an organization. Communication is a central function of organizations, as the success of an organization is reliant on individuals coming together for the benefit of organizational success.

=== Understanding Organizations as People ===
Organizational communication provides insights and makes sense of the human processes that occur within organizations. This encompasses power struggles, team building, conflict, decision making, compliance, and all other human aspects of an organization. In early years, organizations gave little regard to the psychological needs of employees. Organizational communication considers how to motivate individuals within an organization by ensuring human needs are met in the workplace.

Modern organizational communication studies consider work-from-home and remote work structures, a phenomenon that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic as digital communication took the forefront.

=== Effective and Ineffective Communication in Organizations ===
Organizational communication extensively covers what communication techniques are appropriate and effective in specific scenarios with a focus on effective management. Informal and formal communication are both essential to an organization’s inner workings, but must be used appropriately. Understanding effective communication techniques can be used to minimize and resolve conflict within an organization.

=== Awareness of Communication Skills ===
The field of organizational communication strives to identify and teach successful communication skills that can be applied within the organization and on a personal level. As awareness of the functions of organizational communication has increased, organizations have had an elevated need for roles that focus on organizational consulting, job training, and career development.

== Perspectives ==
Shockley-Zalabak identified the following two perspectives, essentially as ways of understanding the organizational communication process as a whole.

=== The functional tradition ===
According to Shockley-Zalabak, the functional tradition is &quot;a way of understanding organizational communication by describing what messages do and how they move through organizations.&quot; There are different functions within this process that all work together to contribute to the overall success of the organization, and these functions occur during the repetition of communication patterns in which the members of the organization engage in. The first types of functions are message functions which are &quot;What communication does or how it contributes to the overall functioning of the organization&quot;, and we describe message functions in three different categories which are organizational functions, relationship functions, and change functions. Organizing functions as Shockley-Zalabak states, are &quot;Messages that establish the rules and regulations of a particular environment&quot;. These messages can include items such as newsletters or handbooks for a specific organization, that individuals can read to learn the policies and expectations for a certain company. Relationship functions are &quot;Communication that helps individuals define their roles and assess the compatibility of individual and organizational goals&quot;. These relationship functions are a key aspect to how individuals identify with a company and it helps them develop their sense of belonging which can greatly influence their quality of work. The third and final subcategory within message functions are change functions, which are defined as &quot;messages that help organizations adapt what they do and how they do it&quot;. Change messages occur in various choice making decisions, and they are essential to meet the employee&#x27;s needs as well as have success with continual adaptations within the organization.

===The meaning centered approach===
According to Shockley-Zalabak, the meaning centered approach is &quot;a way of understanding organizational communication by discovering how organizational reality is generated through human interaction&quot;. This approach is more concerned with what communication is instead of why and how it works, and message functions as well as message movement are not focused on as thoroughly in this perspective.

== Theoretical approaches ==

=== Classical ===
Emerging out of the Industrial Revolution and the increased mechanization of work, classical approaches to organizing involve a vertical flow of communication that is highly formal and often written, mostly in a downward direction. The main idea of the classical approach of organizational communication is that the theory compares organizations to a machine. The theory observed and analyze that workers perform the task they are given to in order to contribute to the overall well-being of the organization. Each member has their purpose in the group, just like a part of a machine works does its tasks while cooperate with other parts to have a well-managed, functioning machine. Additionally, just like a machine that collapse when one part fails to function. An organization will fall apart when members are not doing their designated task appropriately. Henri Fayol&#x27;s work on classical management identifies five elements of management suggesting tasks for managers; planning, organizing, command, coordination, and control; and six principles of management suggesting how managers might enact the aforementioned elements of management; scalar chain, unity of command, unity of direction, division of labor, order, and span of control; relative to this approach.

=== Human relations ===
The human relation approach is based on several different theorists such as: Elton Mayo, McGregors&#x27;s Douglas, Abraham Maslow, Mary Parker Follett&#x27;s and Argyris. The main idea of the human relation approach of organizational communication is that the theory compares organizations to a family. As this theory compares organization to a family, it focuses on workers satisfaction and the relationship within the organizations more compared to the work performance element. The human relation approach emphasizes the importance of employee attitudes, and encourage organizations management team to focus on interpersonal relationships, group dynamics, and leadership styles in achieving organizational effectiveness. It attempts to unearth how directing attention at these areas can helps managers and other organizational actors motivative employees in order to increase productivity and organizational functioning. In using this approach, researchers commonly refer to Abraham Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs to aid in identifying how meeting employee&#x27;s individual needs have an effect on the overall wellbeing of an organization.

=== Cultural ===
The cultural approach to organizing views organizations through a cultural lens, looking at both organizational culture and cultural influences and impacts on organizing. Scholars of cultural organizational communication attempt to identify the value and attributes of strong organizational culture in order to understand its effects on organizational functioning. Edgar Schein suggests three &quot;levels of analysis&quot; for interpreting organizational culture: artifacts, or the experiential elements of an organization; beliefs and values; and the implicit assumptions about and among the organization.

=== Systems ===
The systems approach to organizing views organizations as complex organisms and sees interaction with the external environmental as essential to survival. Components of this approach include hierarchical ordering, interdependence, and permeability. Processes of exchange are central to this approach; the concept of input-throughput-output identifies how this process is identified within this system.

=== Constitutive ===
The constitutive approach is an organizational communications theory originating in Robert T. Craig’s chapter of the book Communication Theory: Communication Theory as a Field. An organizational constitutive approach views communication processes as a means of forming and maintaining organizations. Ideas of communication have evolved throughout history. As a practical solution to contemporary social problems, the constitutive model is presented. For example, traditional ideas and institutions are eroding, cultural diversity and interdependence are increasing, and democratic participation in social reality is in high demand.

=== Critical ===
Critical approaches to organizational communication maintain a focus on power structures and power imbalances in regards to organizing. Critical theory is centered around the argument that power imbalances, and therefore oppression and domination, are innate parts of social structures and organizations. The critical approach seeks to identify organizational sources of power and control in order to empower groups of oppressed people. Within this approach there is a focus on ideological and hegemonic systems.

=== Feminist ===
Feminist approaches to organizational communication is a relatively new area of scholarship, originating in the 1970&#x27;s. Similar to the critical approach, feminist theory highlights power relations in organizational structures and institutionalized male domination as an instrument of oppression against women. The feminist approach is intersectional, calling for the recognition of multiple perspectives of race, sexuality, and nationality. The underlying assumption in feminist organizational theory is that women generally adapt to male norms within the workplace but are still subject to female stereotypes. The feminist approach aims to identify structural and cultural barriers in the workplace and how to eliminate them.

=== Communicative rationality ===
Communicative rationality is a theory developed from the works of Jürgen Habermas, a german philosopher. The communicative rationality approach has been developed to explain why successful communication needs the use of human rationality to be effective. The theory derives from the philosophical study of universal pragmatics, which looks to understand what circumstances are needed for reaching understanding in communications.

== Conflict management ==
Conflict is experienced by all organizations, therefore strategies to mitigate its effects on the wellbeing of organizations have been developed over time by both researchers and scholars alike. Professionals solely aim to diminish any conflicts that may arise within the workplace in the most effective manner as possible. In order to do this, these employees must possess strong conflict resolution skills.

Since conflicts in the workplace typically arise in various magnitudes, it is important that they are dealt with as soon as possible. For instance, if an individual tends to leave their space consistently messy, it can disrupt the entire office and leave for a multitude of other conflicts to arise if not dealt in a timely manner. Another example is if another co-worker tends to be disruptive or raise their voice. Both instances can be related to both internal and external sources, however, must be dealt with the same sufficiency since they could become reoccurring, daily issues if not dealt with.

A leaders ability in conflict management is important. It was found that leaders who focus on collaboration have a higher success rate than those who focus on avoidant or dominating conflict behaviour. It is also important that leaders are trained correctly on conflict management before being placed on the floor.

==Research==

===Research methodologies===
Historically, organizational communication was driven primarily by quantitative research methodologies. Included in functional organizational communication research are statistical analyses (such as surveys, text indexing, network mapping and behavior modeling). In the early 1980s, the interpretive revolution took place in organizational communication. In Putnam and Pacanowsky&#x27;s 1983 text &quot;Communication and Organizations: An Interpretive Approach&quot;. they argued for opening up methodological space for qualitative approaches such as narrative analyses, participant-observation, interviewing, rhetoric and textual approaches readings) and philosophic inquiries.

In addition to qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, there is also a third research approach called mixed methods. &quot;Mixed methods is a type of procedural approach for conducting research that involves collecting, analyzing, and mixing quantitative and qualitative data within a single program of study. Its rationale postulates that the use of both qualitative and quantitative research provides a better and richer understanding of a research problem than either traditional research approach alone provides.&quot; Complex contextual situations are easier to understand when using a mixed methods research approach, compared to using a qualitative or quantitative research approach. There are more than fifteen mixed method design typologies that have been identified. Because these typologies share many characteristics and criteria, they have been classified into six different types. Three of these types are sequential, meaning that one type of data collection and analysis happens before the other. The other three designs are concurrent, meaning both qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time.

===Sequential explanatory design===
To achieve results from a sequential explanatory design, researchers would take the results from analyzing quantitative data and get a better explanation through a qualitative follow up. They then interpret how the qualitative data explains the quantitative data.

===Sequential exploratory design===
Although sequential exploratory design may resemble sequential explanatory design, the order in which data is collected is reversed. Researchers begin with collecting qualitative data and analyzing it, then follow up by building on it through a quantitative research method. They use the results from qualitative data to form variables, instruments and interventions for quantitative surveys and questionnaires.

===Sequential transformative design===
Researchers in line with sequential transformative design are led by a &quot;theoretical perspective such as a conceptual framework, a specific ideology, or an advocacy position and employs what will best serve the researcher&#x27;s theoretical or ideological perspective&quot;. Therefore, with this research design, it could be either the qualitative or quantitative method that is used first and priority depends on circumstance and resource availability, but can be given to either.

===Concurrent triangulation design===
With a concurrent triangulation design, although data is collected through both quantitative and qualitative methods at the same time, they are collected separately with equal priority during one phase. Later, during the analysis phase, the mixing of the two methods takes place.

===Concurrent embedded design===
In a concurrent embedded design, again, both qualitative and quantitative data is collected, although here one method supports the other. Then, one of the two methods (either qualitative or quantitative) transforms into a support for the dominant method.

===Concurrent transformative design===
The concurrent transformative design allows the researcher to be guided by their theoretical perspective, so their qualitative and quantitative data may have equal or unequal priority. Again, they are both collected during one phase.

Mixed methods capitalizes on maximizing the strengths of qualitative and quantitative research and minimizing their individual weaknesses by combining both data. Quantitative research is criticized for not considering contexts, having a lack of depth and not giving participants a voice. On the other hand, qualitative research is criticized for smaller sample sizes, possible researcher bias and a lack of generalizability.

During the 1980s and 1990s critical organizational scholarship began to gain prominence with a focus on issues of gender, race, class, and power/knowledge. In its current state, the study of organizational communication is open methodologically, with research from post-positive, interpretive, critical, postmodern, and discursive paradigms being published regularly.

Organizational communication scholarship appears in a number of communication journals including but not limited to &quot;Management Communication Quarterly&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Business Communication&quot;, &quot;Journal of Applied Communication Research&quot;, &quot;Communication Monographs&quot;, &quot;Academy of Management Journal&quot;, &quot;Communication Studies&quot;, and &quot;Southern Communication Journal&quot;.

==Current research topics==
In some circles, the field of organizational communication has moved from acceptance of mechanistic models (e.g., information moving from a sender to a receiver) to a study of the persistent, hegemonic and taken-for-granted ways in which we not only use communication to accomplish certain tasks within organizational settings (e.g., public speaking) but also how the organizations in which we participate affect us.

These approaches include &quot;postmodern&quot;, &quot;critical&quot;, &quot;participatory&quot;, &quot;feminist&quot;, &quot;power/political&quot;, &quot;organic&quot;, etc. and adds to disciplines as wide-ranging as sociology, philosophy, theology, psychology, business, business administration, institutional management, medicine (health communication), neurology (neural nets), semiotics, anthropology, international relations, and music.

Currently, some topics of research and theory in the field are:

Constitution, e.g.,

* How communicative behaviors construct or modify organizing processes or products?
* How communication itself plays a constitutive role in organizations?
* How the organizations within which we interact affect our communicative behaviors, and through these, our own identities?
* Structures other than organizations which might be constituted through our communicative activity (e.g., markets, cooperatives, tribes, political parties, social movements).
* When does something &quot;become&quot; an organization? When does an organization become (an)other thing(s)? Can one organization &quot;house&quot; another? Is the organization still a useful entity/thing/concept, or has the social/political environment changed so much that what we now call &quot;organization&quot; is so different from the organization of even a few decades ago that it cannot be usefully tagged with the same word – &quot;organization&quot;?

Narrative, e.g.,
*How do group members employ narrative to acculturate/initiate/indoctrinate new members?
*Do organizational stories act on different levels? Are different narratives purposively invoked to achieve specific outcomes, or are there specific roles of &quot;organizational storyteller&quot;? If so, are stories told by the storyteller received differently from those told by others in the organization?
*In what ways does the organization attempt to influence storytelling about the organization? under what conditions does the organization appear to be more or less effective in obtaining a desired outcome?
*When these stories conflict with one another or with official rules/policies, how are the conflicts worked out? in situations in which alternative accounts are available, who or how or why are some accepted and others rejected?

Identity, e.g.,
* Who do we see ourselves to be, in terms of our organizational affiliations?
* Do communicative behaviors or occurrences in one or more of the organizations in which we participate effect changes in us? To what extent do we consist of the organizations to which we belong?
* Is it possible for individuals to successfully resist organizational identity? what would that look like?
* Do people who define themselves by their work-organizational membership communicate differently within the organizational setting than people who define themselves more by an avocational (non-vocational) set of relationships?
* For example, researchers have studied how human service workers and firefighters use humor at their jobs as a way to affirm their identity in the face of various challenges. Others, have examined the identities of police organizations, prison guards, and professional women workers.

Interrelatedness of organizational experiences, e.g.,
* How do our communicative interactions in one organizational setting affect our communicative actions in other organizational settings?
* How do the phenomenological experiences of participants in a particular organizational setting effect changes in other areas of their lives?
* When the organizational status of a member is significantly changed (e.g., by promotion or expulsion) how are their other organizational memberships affected?
* What kind of future relationship between business and society does organizational communication seem to predict?

Power e.g.,
* How does the use of particular communicative practices within an organizational setting reinforce or alter the various interrelated power relationships within the setting? Are the potential responses of those within or around these organizational settings constrained by factors or processes either within or outside of the organization – (assuming there is an &quot;outside&quot;)?
* Do taken-for-granted organizational practices work to fortify the dominant hegemonic narrative? Do individuals resist/confront these practices, through what actions/agencies, and to what effects?
* Do status changes in an organization (e.g., promotions, demotions, restructuring, financial/social strata changes) change communicative behavior? Are there criteria employed by organizational members to differentiate between &quot;legitimate&quot; (i.e., endorsed by the formal organizational structure) and &quot;illegitimate&quot; (i.e., opposed by or unknown to the formal power structure) behaviors? When are they successful, and what do we mean by &quot;successful&quot; when there are &quot;pretenders&quot; or &quot;usurpers&quot; who employ these communicative means?
Diversity, Equity, and inclusion (DEI) in organizational communication.  

Research in this area covers a range of principles and practices aimed at fostering an inclusive organizational environment by leveraging effective communication strategies. DEI in the workplace encompasses a variety of personal and social bases of identity, including race-ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic status, religion, sexual orientation, country of origin, etc.  

Research focus under DEI organizational communication includes;  

* The application of different communication theories to better understand and address the diverse perspectives, backgrounds, orientations, and experiences within the workforce. - Research has focused on analyzing the composition of employee dynamics to first identify the diverse perspectives and second to understand them.   
* How effective communication is pivotal in creating inclusive policies ranging from employee recruitment, retention, compensation, benefits, and retirement. - Scholars have reviewed the wording of organization policies and communicated messages to identify loopholes qualifiers that might have hindered DEI in the past.   
* How implicit bias is embedded in organizational culture and practices. - Research focuses on helping employees and organizational leadership to identify their bias against minority groups through their verbal and non-verbal communication. 

Research focus of race-ethnicity under DEI in the workplace includes;  

* The underrepresentation of minority races in the workplace. 
* Challenges that hinder underrepresented minority group members from advancing to leadership positions in the workplace. 
* The emotional, social, psychological, and physical effects of the challenges that minority group members face in the workplace. 

Research focus of Gender under DEI in the workplace includes; 

* Challenges that women face in organizations. 
* Factors that hinder women from rising to leadership positions at work. 
* The stereotype against women leaders and how they have managed to succeed with workplace challenges. 
* Understanding the pressure on women to work more than men to prove themselves in the workplace. 
* The bias against women of color during hiring processes. 
* Contrast in annual renumeration between men and women holding the same position in organizations. 
* Challenges of mentoring women in organizations and how to improve. 
* How effective communication can align leadership messages with organizational values and goals during the implementation of DEI.  
* Challenges minority groups encounter while trying to progress in organizations.  
* How effective communication strategies can foster an increase in the representation of underrepresented groups.   

Further research has also focused on introducing and applying different communication theories to analyze diversity problems in the workplace and proffer solutions on improvement.  

The inclusion of DEI in organizational communications research because it can lead to significant improvement in the world by proposing viable solutions to difficult problems within important social contexts.

<doc id="228058" wikidata="Q552334" url="?curid=228058" title="Breeder reactor">
<text>A breeder reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates more fissile material than it consumes. These reactors can be fueled with more-commonly available isotopes of uranium and thorium, such as uranium-238 and thorium-232, as opposed to the rare uranium-235 which is used in conventional reactors. These materials are called fertile materials since they can be bred into fuel by these breeder reactors.

Breeder reactors achieve this because their neutron economy is high enough to create more fissile fuel than they use. These extra neutrons are absorbed by the fertile material that is loaded into the reactor along with fissile fuel. This irradiated fertile material in turn transmutes into fissile material which can undergo fission reactions.

Breeders were at first found attractive because they made more complete use of uranium fuel than light-water reactors, but interest declined after the 1960s as more uranium reserves were found and new methods of uranium enrichment reduced fuel costs.

== Types ==
Many types of breeder reactor are possible:

A &quot;breeder&quot; is simply a nuclear reactor designed for very high neutron economy with an associated conversion rate higher than 1.0. In principle, almost any reactor design could be tweaked to become a breeder. For example, the light-water reactor, a heavily moderated thermal design, evolved into the fast reactor concept, using light water in a low-density supercritical form to increase the neutron economy enough to allow breeding.

Aside from water-cooled, there are many other types of breeder reactor currently envisioned as possible. These include molten-salt cooled, gas cooled, and liquid-metal cooled designs in many variations. Almost any of these basic design types may be fueled by uranium, plutonium, many minor actinides, or thorium, and they may be designed for many different goals, such as creating more fissile fuel, long-term steady-state operation, or active burning of nuclear wastes.

Extant reactor designs are sometimes divided into two broad categories based upon their neutron spectrum, which generally separates those designed to use primarily uranium and transuranics from those designed to use thorium and avoid transuranics. These designs are:
* Fast breeder reactors (FBRs) which use &#x27;fast&#x27; (i.e. unmoderated) neutrons to breed fissile plutonium (and possibly higher transuranics) from fertile uranium-238. The fast spectrum is flexible enough that it can also breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium, if desired.
* Thermal breeder reactors which use &#x27;thermal-spectrum&#x27; or &#x27;slow&#x27; (i.e. moderated) neutrons to breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium. Due to the behavior of the various nuclear fuels, a thermal breeder is thought commercially feasible only with thorium fuel, which avoids the buildup of the heavier transuranics.

===Fast breeder reactor===
All current large-scale FBR power stations were liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBR) cooled by liquid sodium. These have been of one of two designs:
*&quot;Loop&quot; type, in which the primary coolant is circulated through primary heat exchangers outside the reactor tank (but inside the biological shield due to radioactive in the primary coolant)
*&quot;Pool&quot; type, in which the primary heat exchangers and pumps are immersed in the reactor tank

There are only two commercially operating breeder reactors : the BN-600 reactor, at 560 MWe, and the BN-800 reactor, at 880 MWe. Both are Russian sodium-cooled reactors. The designs use liquid metal as the primary coolant, to transfer heat from the core to steam used to power the electricity generating turbines. FBRs have been built cooled by liquid metals other than sodium—some early FBRs used mercury; other experimental reactors have used a sodium-potassium alloy. Both have the advantage that they are liquids at room temperature, which is convenient for experimental rigs but less important for pilot or full-scale power stations.

Three of the proposed generation IV reactor types are FBRs:
*Gas-cooled fast reactor cooled by helium.
*Sodium-cooled fast reactor based on the existing LMFBR and integral fast reactor designs.
*Lead-cooled fast reactor based on Soviet naval propulsion units.

FBRs usually use a mixed oxide fuel core of up to 20% plutonium dioxide (PuO2) and at least 80% uranium dioxide (UO2). Another fuel option is metal alloys, typically a blend of uranium, plutonium, and zirconium (used because it is &quot;transparent&quot; to neutrons). Enriched uranium can be used on its own.

Many designs surround the reactor core in a blanket of tubes that contain non-fissile uranium-238, which, by capturing fast neutrons from the reaction in the core, converts to fissile plutonium-239 (as is some of the uranium in the core), which is then reprocessed and used as nuclear fuel. Other FBR designs rely on the geometry of the fuel (which also contains uranium-238), arranged to attain sufficient fast neutron capture. The plutonium-239 (or the fissile uranium-235) fissile cross-section is much smaller in a fast spectrum than in a thermal spectrum, as is the ratio between the 239Pu/235U fission cross-section and the 238U absorption cross-section. This increases the concentration of 239Pu/235U needed to sustain a chain reaction, as well as the ratio of breeding to fission.
On the other hand, a fast reactor needs no moderator to slow down the neutrons at all, taking advantage of the fast neutrons producing a greater number of neutrons per fission than slow neutrons. For this reason ordinary liquid water, being a moderator and neutron absorber, is an undesirable primary coolant for fast reactors. Because large amounts of water in the core are required to cool the reactor, the yield of neutrons and therefore breeding of 239Pu are strongly affected. Theoretical work has been done on reduced moderation water reactors, which may have a sufficiently fast spectrum to provide a breeding ratio slightly over 1. This would likely result in an unacceptable power derating and high costs in a liquid-water-cooled reactor, but the supercritical water coolant of the supercritical water reactor (SCWR) has sufficient heat capacity to allow adequate cooling with less water, making a fast-spectrum water-cooled reactor a practical possibility.

The type of coolants, temperatures, and fast neutron spectrum puts the fuel cladding material (normally austenitic stainless or ferritic-martensitic steels) under extreme conditions. The understanding of the radiation damage, coolant interactions, stresses, and temperatures are necessary for the safe operation of any reactor core. All materials used to date in sodium-cooled fast reactors have known limits. Oxide dispersion-strengthened alloy steel is viewed as the long-term radiation resistant fuel-cladding material that can overcome the shortcomings of today&#x27;s material choices.

====Integral fast reactor====

One design of fast neutron reactor, specifically conceived to address the waste disposal and plutonium issues, was the integral fast reactor (IFR, also known as an integral fast breeder reactor, although the original reactor was designed to not breed a net surplus of fissile material).

To solve the waste disposal problem, the IFR had an on-site electrowinning fuel-reprocessing unit that recycled the uranium and all the transuranics (not just plutonium) via electroplating, leaving just short-half-life fission products in the waste. Some of these fission products could later be separated for industrial or medical uses and the rest sent to a waste repository. The IFR pyroprocessing system uses molten cadmium cathodes and electrorefiners to reprocess metallic fuel directly on-site at the reactor. Such systems co-mingle all the minor actinides with both uranium and plutonium. The systems are compact and self-contained, so that no plutonium-containing material needs to be transported away from the site of the breeder reactor. Breeder reactors incorporating such technology would most likely be designed with breeding ratios very close to 1.00, so that after an initial loading of enriched uranium and/or plutonium fuel, the reactor would then be refueled only with small deliveries of natural uranium. A quantity of natural uranium equivalent to a block about the size of a milk crate delivered once per month would be all the fuel such a 1 gigawatt reactor would need. Such self-contained breeders are currently envisioned as the final self-contained and self-supporting ultimate goal of nuclear reactor designers. The project was canceled in 1994 by United States Secretary of Energy Hazel O&#x27;Leary.

====Other fast reactors====
The first fast reactor built and operated was the Los Alamos Plutonium Fast Reactor (&quot;Clementine&quot;) in Los Alamos, NM. Clementine was fueled by Ga-stabilized delta-phase Pu and cooled with mercury. It contained a &#x27;window&#x27; of Th-232 in anticipation of breeding experiments, but no reports were made available regarding this feature.

Another proposed fast reactor is a fast molten salt reactor, in which the molten salt&#x27;s moderating properties are insignificant. This is typically achieved by replacing the light metal fluorides (e.g. LiF, BeF2) in the salt carrier with heavier metal chlorides (e.g., KCl, RbCl, ZrCl4).

Several prototype FBRs have been built, ranging in electrical output from a few light bulbs&#x27; equivalent (EBR-I, 1951) to over 1,000 MWe. As of 2006, the technology is not economically competitive to thermal reactor technology, but India, Japan, China, South Korea, and Russia are all committing substantial research funds to further development of fast breeder reactors, anticipating that rising uranium prices will change this in the long term. Germany, in contrast, abandoned the technology due to safety concerns. The SNR-300 fast breeder reactor was finished after 19 years despite cost overruns summing up to a total of 3.6 billion, only to then be abandoned. 

===Thermal breeder reactor===
The advanced heavy-water reactor is one of the few proposed large-scale uses of thorium. India is developing this technology, motivated by substantial thorium reserves; almost a third of the world&#x27;s thorium reserves are in India, which lacks significant uranium reserves.

The third and final core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station 60 MWe reactor was a light water thorium breeder, which began operating in 1977. It used pellets made of thorium dioxide and uranium-233 oxide; initially, the U-233 content of the pellets was 5–6% in the seed region, 1.5–3% in the blanket region, and none in the reflector region. It operated at 236 MWt, generating 60 MWe, and ultimately produced over 2.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity. After five years, the core was removed and found to contain nearly 1.4% more fissile material than when it was installed, demonstrating that breeding from thorium had occurred.

A liquid fluoride thorium reactor is also planned as a thorium thermal breeder. Liquid-fluoride reactors may have attractive features, such as inherent safety, no need to manufacture fuel rods, and possibly simpler reprocessing of the liquid fuel. This concept was first investigated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment in the 1960s. From 2012 it became the subject of renewed interest worldwide.

== Fuel resources ==
Breeder reactors could, in principle, extract almost all of the energy contained in uranium or thorium, decreasing fuel requirements by a factor of 100 compared to widely used once-through light water reactors, which extract less than 1% of the energy in the actinide metal (uranium or thorium) mined from the earth. The high fuel-efficiency of breeder reactors could greatly reduce concerns about fuel supply, energy used in mining, and storage of radioactive waste. With seawater uranium extraction (currently too expensive to be economical), there is enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy the world&#x27;s energy needs for 5 billion years at 1983&#x27;s total energy consumption rate, thus making nuclear energy effectively a renewable energy. In addition to seawater, the average crustal granite rocks contain significant quantities of uranium and thorium that with breeder reactors can supply abundant energy for the remaining lifespan of the sun on the main sequence of stellar evolution.

=== Nuclear waste ===

In broad terms, spent nuclear fuel has three main components. The first consists of fission products, the leftover fragments of fuel atoms after they have been split to release energy. Fission products come in dozens of elements and hundreds of isotopes, all of them lighter than uranium. The second main component of spent fuel is transuranics (atoms heavier than uranium), which are generated from uranium or heavier atoms in the fuel when they absorb neutrons but do not undergo fission. All transuranic isotopes fall within the actinide series on the periodic table, and so they are frequently referred to as the actinides. The largest component is the remaining uranium which is around 98.25% uranium-238, 1.1% uranium-235, and 0.65% uranium-236. The U-236 comes from the non-fission capture reaction where U-235 absorbs a neutron but releases only a high energy gamma ray instead of undergoing fission. 

The physical behavior of the fission products is markedly different from that of the actinides. In particular, fission products do not undergo fission and therefore cannot be used as nuclear fuel. Indeed, because fission products are often neutron poisons (absorbing neutrons that could be used to sustain a chain reaction), fission products are viewed as nuclear &#x27;ashes&#x27; left over from consuming fissile materials. Furthermore, only seven long-lived fission product isotopes have half-lives longer than a hundred years, which makes their geological storage or disposal less problematic than for transuranic materials.

With increased concerns about nuclear waste, breeding fuel cycles came under renewed interest as they can reduce actinide wastes, particularly plutonium and minor actinides. Breeder reactors are designed to fission the actinide wastes as fuel and thus convert them to more fission products. After spent nuclear fuel is removed from a light water reactor, it undergoes a complex decay profile as each nuclide decays at a different rate. There is a large gap in the decay half-lives of fission products compared to transuranic isotopes. If the transuranics are left in the spent fuel, after 1,000 to 100,000 years the slow decay of these transuranics would generate most of the radioactivity in that spent fuel. Thus, removing the transuranics from the waste eliminates much of the long-term radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel.

Today&#x27;s commercial light-water reactors do breed some new fissile material, mostly in the form of plutonium. Because commercial reactors were never designed as breeders, they do not convert enough uranium-238 into plutonium to replace the uranium-235 consumed. Nonetheless, at least one-third of the power produced by commercial nuclear reactors comes from fission of plutonium generated within the fuel. Even with this level of plutonium consumption, light water reactors consume only part of the plutonium and minor actinides they produce, and nonfissile isotopes of plutonium build up, along with significant quantities of other minor actinides.

Breeding fuel cycles attracted renewed interest because of their potential to reduce actinide wastes, particularly various isotopes of plutonium and the minor actinides (neptunium, americium, curium, etc.). Since breeder reactors on a closed fuel cycle would use nearly all of the isotopes of these actinides fed into them as fuel, their fuel requirements would be reduced by a factor of about 100. The volume of waste they generate would be reduced by a factor of about 100 as well. While there is a huge reduction in the &quot;volume&quot; of waste from a breeder reactor, the &quot;activity&quot; of the waste is about the same as that produced by a light-water reactor.

Waste from a breeder reactor has a different decay behavior because it is made up of different materials. Breeder reactor waste is mostly fission products, while light-water reactor waste is mostly unused uranium isotopes and a large quantity of transuranics. After spent nuclear fuel has been removed from a light-water reactor for longer than 100,000 years, the transuranics would be the main source of radioactivity. Eliminating them would eliminate much of the long-term radioactivity from the spent fuel.

In principle, breeder fuel cycles can recycle and consume all actinides, leaving only fission products. As the graphic in this section indicates, fission products have a peculiar &quot;gap&quot; in their aggregate half-lives, such that no fission products have a half-life between 91 and 200,000 years. As a result of this physical oddity, after several hundred years in storage, the activity of the radioactive waste from an FBR would quickly drop to the low level of the long-lived fission products. However, to obtain this benefit requires the highly efficient separation of transuranics from spent fuel. If the fuel reprocessing methods used leave a large fraction of the transuranics in the final waste stream, this advantage would be greatly reduced.

The FBR&#x27;s fast neutrons can fission actinide nuclei with even numbers of both protons and neutrons. Such nuclei usually lack the low-speed &quot;thermal neutron&quot; resonances of fissile fuels used in LWRs. The thorium fuel cycle inherently produces lower levels of heavy actinides. The fertile material in the thorium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 232, while the fertile material in the uranium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 238. That mass difference means that thorium-232 requires six more neutron capture events per nucleus before the transuranic elements can be produced. In addition to this simple mass difference, the reactor gets two chances to fission the nuclei as the mass increases: First as the effective fuel nuclei U233, and as it absorbs two more neutrons, again as the fuel nuclei U235.

A reactor whose main purpose is to destroy actinides rather than increasing fissile fuel-stocks is sometimes known as a burner reactor. Both breeding and burning depend on good neutron economy, and many designs can do either. Breeding designs surround the core by a breeding blanket of fertile material. Waste burners surround the core with non-fertile wastes to be destroyed. Some designs add neutron reflectors or absorbers.

==Design==
=== Conversion ratio ===
One measure of a reactor&#x27;s performance is the &quot;conversion ratio&quot;, defined as the ratio of new fissile atoms produced to fissile atoms consumed. All proposed nuclear reactors except specially designed and operated actinide burners experience some degree of conversion. As long as there is any amount of a fertile material within the neutron flux of the reactor, some new fissile material is always created. When the conversion ratio is greater than 1, it is often called the &quot;breeding ratio&quot;.

For example, commonly used light water reactors have a conversion ratio of approximately 0.6. Pressurized heavy-water reactors running on natural uranium have a conversion ratio of 0.8. In a breeder reactor, the conversion ratio is higher than 1. &quot;Break-even&quot; is achieved when the conversion ratio reaches 1.0 and the reactor produces as much fissile material as it uses.

=== Doubling time ===
The doubling time is the amount of time it would take for a breeder reactor to produce enough new fissile material to replace the original fuel and additionally produce an equivalent amount of fuel for another nuclear reactor. This was considered an important measure of breeder performance in early years, when uranium was thought to be scarce. However, since uranium is more abundant than thought in the early days of nuclear reactor development, and given the amount of plutonium available in spent reactor fuel, doubling time has become a less important metric in modern breeder-reactor design.

=== Burnup ===
&quot;Burnup&quot; is a measure of how much energy has been extracted from a given mass of heavy metal in fuel, often expressed (for power reactors) in terms of gigawatt-days per ton of heavy metal. Burnup is an important factor in determining the types and abundances of isotopes produced by a fission reactor. Breeder reactors by design have high burnup compared to a conventional reactor, as breeder reactors produce more of their waste in the form of fission products, while most or all of the actinides are meant to be fissioned and destroyed.

In the past, breeder-reactor development focused on reactors with low breeding ratios, from 1.01 for the Shippingport Reactor running on thorium fuel and cooled by conventional light water to over 1.2 for the Soviet BN-350 liquid-metal-cooled reactor. Theoretical models of breeders with liquid sodium coolant flowing through tubes inside fuel elements (&quot;tube-in-shell&quot; construction) suggest breeding ratios of at least 1.8 are possible on an industrial scale. The Soviet BR-1 test reactor achieved a breeding ratio of 2.5 under non-commercial conditions.

=== Reprocessing ===
Fission of the nuclear fuel in any reactor unavoidably produces neutron-absorbing fission products. The fertile material from a breeder reactor then needs to be reprocessed to remove those neutron poisons. This step is required to fully utilize the ability to breed as much or more fuel than is consumed. All reprocessing can present a proliferation concern, since it can extract weapons-usable material from spent fuel. The most common reprocessing technique, PUREX, presents a particular concern since it was expressly designed to separate plutonium. Early proposals for the breeder-reactor fuel cycle posed an even greater proliferation concern because they would use PUREX to separate plutonium in a highly attractive isotopic form for use in nuclear weapons.

Several countries are developing reprocessing methods that do not separate the plutonium from the other actinides. For instance, the non-water-based pyrometallurgical electrowinning process, when used to reprocess fuel from an integral fast reactor, leaves large amounts of radioactive actinides in the reactor fuel. More conventional water-based reprocessing systems include SANEX, UNEX, DIAMEX, COEX, and TRUEX, and proposals to combine PUREX with those and other co-processes. All these systems have moderately better proliferation resistance than PUREX, though their adoption rate is low.

In the thorium cycle, thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233, which then decays to uranium-233. If the protactinium remains in the reactor, small amounts of uranium-232 are also produced, which has the strong gamma emitter thallium-208 in its decay chain. Similar to uranium-fueled designs, the longer the fuel and fertile material remain in the reactor, the more of these undesirable elements build up. In the envisioned commercial thorium reactors, high levels of uranium-232 would be allowed to accumulate, leading to extremely high gamma-radiation doses from any uranium derived from thorium. These gamma rays complicate the safe handling of a weapon and the design of its electronics; this explains why uranium-233 has never been pursued for weapons beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations.

While the thorium cycle may be proliferation-resistant with regard to uranium-233 extraction from fuel (because of the presence of uranium-232), it poses a proliferation risk from an alternate route of uranium-233 extraction, which involves chemically extracting protactinium-233 and allowing it to decay to pure uranium-233 outside of the reactor. This process is an obvious chemical operation which is not required for normal operation of these reactor designs, but it could feasibly happen beyond the oversight of organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and thus must be safeguarded against.

==Production==

Like many aspects of nuclear power, fast breeder reactors have been subject to much controversy over the years. In 2010 the International Panel on Fissile Materials said &quot;After six decades and the expenditure of the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars, the promise of breeder reactors remains largely unfulfilled and efforts to commercialize them have been steadily cut back in most countries&quot;. In Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, breeder reactor development programs have been abandoned. The rationale for pursuing breeder reactors—sometimes explicit and sometimes implicit—was based on the following key assumptions:
*It was expected that uranium would be scarce and high-grade deposits would quickly become depleted if fission power were deployed on a large scale; the reality, however, is that since the end of the Cold War, uranium has been much cheaper and more abundant than early designers expected.
*It was expected that breeder reactors would quickly become economically competitive with the light-water reactors that dominate nuclear power today, but the reality is that capital costs are at least 25% more than water-cooled reactors.
*It was thought that breeder reactors could be as safe and reliable as light-water reactors, but safety issues are cited as a concern with fast reactors that use a sodium coolant, where a leak could lead to a sodium fire.
*It was expected that the proliferation risks posed by breeders and their &quot;closed&quot; fuel cycle, in which plutonium would be recycled, could be managed. But since plutonium-breeding reactors produce plutonium from U238, and thorium reactors produce fissile U233 from thorium, all breeding cycles could theoretically pose proliferation risks. However U-232, which is always present in U-233 produced in breeder reactors, is a strong gamma-emitter via its daughter products, and would make weapon handling extremely hazardous and the weapon easy to detect.

Some past anti-nuclear advocates have become pro-nuclear power as a clean source of electricity since breeder reactors effectively recycle most of their waste. This solves one of the most-important negative issues of nuclear power. In the documentary &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Promise&quot;, a case is made for breeder reactors because they provide a real high-kW alternative to fossil fuel energy. According to the movie, one pound of uranium provides as much energy as 5,000 barrels of oil.

=== Notable reactors ===

The Soviet Union constructed a series of fast reactors, the first being mercury-cooled and fueled with plutonium metal, and the later plants sodium-cooled and fueled with plutonium oxide. BR-1 (1955) was 100W (thermal) was followed by BR-2 at 100 kW and then the 5 MW BR-5. BOR-60 (first criticality 1969) was 60 MW, with construction started in 1965.

==Future plants==
=== India ===
India has been trying to develop fast breeder reactors for decades but suffered repeated delays. By December 2024 the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor is due to be completed and commissioned. The program is intended to use fertile thorium-232 to breed fissile uranium-233. India is also pursuing thorium thermal breeder reactor technology. India&#x27;s focus on thorium is due to the nation&#x27;s large reserves, though known worldwide reserves of thorium are four times those of uranium. India&#x27;s Department of Atomic Energy said in 2007 that it would simultaneously construct four more breeder reactors of 500 MWe each including two at Kalpakkam.

BHAVINI, an Indian nuclear power company, was established in 2003 to construct, commission, and operate all stage II fast breeder reactors outlined in India&#x27;s three-stage nuclear power programme. To advance these plans, the FBR-600 is a pool-type sodium-cooled reactor with a rating of 600 MWe.

=== China ===
The China Experimental Fast Reactor is a 25 MW(e) prototype for the planned China Prototype Fast Reactor. It started generating power in 2011. China initiated a research and development project in thorium molten-salt thermal breeder-reactor technology (liquid fluoride thorium reactor), formally announced at the Chinese Academy of Sciences annual conference in 2011. Its ultimate target was to investigate and develop a thorium-based molten salt nuclear system over about 20 years.

=== South Korea ===
South Korea is developing a design for a standardized modular FBR for export, to complement the standardized pressurized water reactor and CANDU designs they have already developed and built, but has not yet committed to building a prototype.


=== Russia ===
Russia has a plan for increasing its fleet of fast breeder reactors significantly. A BN-800 reactor (800 MWe) at Beloyarsk was completed in 2012, succeeding a smaller BN-600. It reached its full power production in 2016. Plans for the construction of a larger BN-1200 reactor (1,200 MWe) was scheduled for completion in 2018, with two additional BN-1200 reactors built by the end of 2030. However, in 2015 Rosenergoatom postponed construction indefinitely to allow fuel design to be improved after more experience of operating the BN-800 reactor, and among cost concerns.

An experimental lead-cooled fast reactor, BREST-300 will be built at the Siberian Chemical Combine in Seversk. The BREST (, ) design is seen as a successor to the BN series and the 300 MWe unit at the SCC could be the forerunner to a 1,200 MWe version for wide deployment as a commercial power generation unit. The development program is as part of an Advanced Nuclear Technologies Federal Program 2010–2020 that seeks to exploit fast reactors for uranium efficiency while &#x27;burning&#x27; radioactive substances that would otherwise be disposed of as waste. Its core would measure about 2.3 metres in diameter by 1.1 metres in height and contain 16 tonnes of fuel. The unit would be refuelled every year, with each fuel element spending five years in total within the core. Lead coolant temperature would be around 540 °C, giving a high efficiency of 43%, primary heat production of 700 MWt yielding electrical power of 300 MWe. The operational lifespan of the unit could be 60 years. The design was expected to be completed by NIKIET in 2014 for construction between 2016 and 2020. 
By the end of 2024 the cooling tower had been built, and the target for starting operation was 2026.

=== Japan ===
In 2006 the United States, France, and Japan signed an &quot;arrangement&quot; to research and develop sodium-cooled fast reactors in support of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. In 2007 the Japanese government selected Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as the &quot;core company in FBR development in Japan&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Mitsubishi FBR Systems was launched to develop and eventually sell FBR technology.

=== France ===
In 2010 the French government allocated 651.6 million to the Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique to finalize the design of ASTRID (Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration), a 600 MW fourth-generation reactor design to be finalized in 2020. the UK had shown interest in the PRISM reactor and was working in concert with France to develop ASTRID. In 2019, CEA announced this design would not be built before mid-century.

=== United States ===
Kirk Sorensen, former NASA scientist and chief nuclear technologist at Teledyne Brown Engineering, has long been a promoter of thorium fuel cycle and particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors. In 2011, Sorensen founded Flibe Energy, a company aimed to develop 20–50 MW LFTR reactor designs to power military bases.

In October 2010 GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with the operators of the US Department of Energy&#x27;s Savannah River Site, which should allow the construction of a demonstration plant based on the company&#x27;s S-PRISM fast breeder reactor prior to the design receiving full Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing approval. In October 2011 &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and senior advisers within the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) had asked for technical and financial details of PRISM, partly as a means of reducing the country&#x27;s plutonium stockpile.

The traveling wave reactor proposed in a patent by Intellectual Ventures is a fast breeder reactor designed to not need fuel reprocessing during the decades-long lifetime of the reactor. The breed-burn wave in the TWR design does not move from one end of the reactor to the other but gradually from the inside out. Moreover, as the fuel&#x27;s composition changes through nuclear transmutation, fuel rods are continually reshuffled within the core to optimize the neutron flux and fuel usage at any given point in time. Thus, instead of letting the wave propagate through the fuel, the fuel itself is moved through a largely stationary burn wave. This is contrary to many media reports, which have popularized the concept as a candle-like reactor with a burn region that moves down a stick of fuel. By replacing a static core configuration with an actively managed &quot;standing wave&quot; or &quot;soliton&quot; core, TerraPower&#x27;s design avoids the problem of cooling a highly variable burn region. Under this scenario, the reconfiguration of fuel rods is accomplished remotely by robotic devices; the containment vessel remains closed during the procedure, and there is no associated downtime.

<doc id="228059" wikidata="Q730573" url="?curid=228059" title="Organizational culture">
<text>Organizational culture encompasses the shared norms, values, behaviors observed in schools, universities, not-for-profit groups, government agencies, and businesses reflecting their core values and strategic direction. Alternative terms include business culture, corporate culture and company culture. The term corporate culture emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was used by managers, sociologists, and organizational theorists in the 1980s.

Organizational culture influences how people interact, how decisions are made (or avoided), the context within which cultural artifacts are created, employee attachment, the organization&#x27;s competitive advantage, and the internal alignment of its units. It is distinct from national culture or the broader cultural background of its workforce.

== Definition ==
Various definitions exist, without consensus. Examples include:

*Deal and Kennedy who defined organizational culture as &quot;the way things get done around here&quot;.
*According to Jaques, &quot;the culture of the factory is its customary and traditional way of thinking and doing of things, which is shared to a greater or lesser degree by all its members, and which new members must learn, and at least partially accept, in order to be accepted into service in the firm&quot;.
*Schein defined it as including a shared &quot;pattern of basic assumptions&quot; that group members acquired over time as they learn to cope with internal and external organizationally relevant problems.
*Ravasi and Schultz characterized it as a set of shared assumptions that guide behaviors. It is also the pattern of such collective behaviors and assumptions that are taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving, thinking, and feeling.
*Schein, Deal and Kennedy, and Kotter advanced the idea that cultures are diverse and may encompass subcultures linked to an individual management teams.
*Ravasi and Schultz and Allaire and Firsirotu claim that organizational culture represents the collective values, beliefs and principles of organizational members. It is influenced by factors such as history, type of product, market, technology, strategy, type of employees, management style, and national culture. Culture includes the organization&#x27;s vision, values, norms, systems, symbols, language, assumptions, environment, location, beliefs and habits. Gallup reported that just 22% of U.S. employees feel connected to their organization&#x27;s culture.
*Hofstede defined organizational culture as &quot;the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one organization from another.&quot;
* McHale defines culture as &quot;how the organization functions and its deeply embedded patterns.&quot;

== History ==
Jaques introduced the concept in his 1951 book &quot;The Changing Culture of a Factory&quot;. The book was a published report of &quot;a case study of developments in the social life of one industrial community between April, 1948 and November 1950&quot;. The case involved a publicly-held British company engaged principally in the manufacture, sale, and servicing of metal bearings. The study concerned itself with the description, analysis, and development of corporate group behaviors.

== Analysis ==
Researchers have proposed myriad dimensions individually and in combination as useful for analyzing organizational culture. Examples include external/internal, strong/weak, flexible/rigid, and many others.

=== Insularity ===
Culture can be externally focused, aiming to satisfy customers, investors, and partners. Alternatively, they can be internally focused, aiming to satisfy employees, comply with union-imposed rules, or to meet conduct standards around issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion. Many organizations lie between such extremes, attempting to balance the needs of multiple stakeholders.

===Strength ===
Any type of culture can be strongly or only tacitly supported. A strong culture is characterized by reinforcing tools such as ceremonies and policies to instill and spread it. The intent is to secure group compliance.

Researchers generally report that organizations having strong cultures are more successful.

=== Cultural ===

Organizational culture is used to control, coordinate, and integrate distinct groups across the organization. Differences in national cultures must be addressed. Such differences include organizational structure and manager/employee relationships.

=== Groupthink ===
Janis defined groupthink as &quot;a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members&#x27; strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.&quot; This is a state in which even if group members have different ideas, they do not challenge the group. Groupthink can lead to lack of creativity and decisions made without critical evaluation. Hogg and separately Deanne et al. stated that groupthink can occur, for example, when group members rely heavily on a charismatic figure or where members evince an &quot;evangelical&quot; belief in the organization&#x27;s values. Groupthink can also occur in groups characterized by a friendly climate conducive to conflict avoidance.

====Five Monkeys Experiment====
Since the late 1960s, the so-called &#x27;Five Monkeys Experiment&#x27; that serves to exemplify the adverse effects of unquestioned traditions has become part of management lore, often titled &quot;How Company Policy Is Made&quot;.

It imagines a situation where five monkeys are in a cage with a banana tied to the ceiling. Whenever a monkey climbs to reach the banana, all five are sprayed with cold water. The group quickly learn to ignore the banana and punish any monkey who attempts to reach for it. If one monkey is removed from the cage and replaced with a newcomer, they too are punished for reaching for the banana. If every monkey is subsequently replaced in this manner, so that none present remember being sprayed with cold water, the group will supposedly continue to punish any attempts to reach the banana. The monkeys are perpetuating a caution that may be redundant &quot;because that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s always been around here&quot;.

=== Rigidity ===
Kotter and Heskett define an adaptive culture as characterized by managers who pay close attention to their constituencies, especially customers, initiating change when needed, and taking risks. They claim that organizations with adaptive cultures perform better.

=== Bullying ===

Bullying manifests in workplaces that allow employees of higher status to harass those of lower status. This generally requires support or at least forbearance from company leaders. Bullying can cascade down the organizational hierarchy as supervisors experiencing bullying display the same behavior to their subordinates.

=== COVID-19 impact ===
The pandemic led many organizations to incorporate limiting spread into their cultures as a collective responsibility. Responses focused on requiring vaccines, hygiene, and masking.

In Asia, mask-wearing was part of several national cultures predating the pandemic. This was driven by experience with prior flus in Asia, such as Spanish flu, Hong Kong flu, Avian flu, and Swine flu, in addition to SARS, as well as various affronts to air quality such as volcanic eruptions.

Somers categorized cultures based on whether the need of the individual or the group was foremost. He used behaviors such as mask-wearing to measure collectivism vs individualism. Cultures otherwise rated &quot;strong&quot; were relatively resistant to change during the pandemic. However, strong cultures that emphasized innovation were more willing to change.

Mandated interventions could be seen by members either as attempts to protect them or to as attempts to exert control despite limited effectiveness, depending on how they were presented.

Digital tools such as videoconferencing, screen-sharing, file sharing, shared document authoring, digital whiteboards, and chat groups became widely accepted, replacing in-person meetings. The reduced amount of face-to-face communications may have impacted organizational cultures. New members, lacking face time with others, experienced difficulty in adapting to their organization&#x27;s culture. The loss of face-time affected existing employees as well, directly weakening cultures, in addition to the indirect effects that strengthened or weakened cultures as organizations reacted in various ways to the pandemic. Some members felt disengaged and expandable rather than essential, alienated, and exhausted.

Sull and Sull reported that employees rated their leadership higher given honest/open communication, integrity, and transparency more than in preceding years. Also, employers and leaders giving more attention to employees&#x27; welfare had a positive impact on cultural adherence. Chambers claimed that this was a short-term response rather than a culture change.

Deloitte argued that employees displayed greater sense of purpose, inspiration, and contribution. Also, leaders became more tolerant of employees&#x27; failure because of a significant increase in experimentation and risk-taking.

Daum and Maraist claimed that sense of purpose relates to customers and the society of which employees are part. They compared hospitals and retail shops. The former had a greater sense of purpose during the pandemic, while the latter had less.

== Indicators ==
Healthy cultures address members&#x27; concerns about the well-being of the organization. Whistleblowing, particularly when it damages a company&#x27;s reputation, is considered to be a sign of a dysfunctional corporate culture, indicating that internal methods of addressing problems are inadequate.

== Role of communication ==
Promulgating a corporate culture requires effort, typically from leaders, but potentially throughout the organization. Among the many types of communication that affect organizational culture are:

* Metaphors such as comparing an organization to a machine or a family.
* Stories
* Rites and ceremonies:
** Rites of passage: employees move into new roles
** Rites of humiliation: employees have power taken away from them
** Rites of enhancement: recognition for accomplishments
** Rites of renewal: strengthen existing social structures
** Rites of conflict reduction: resolve arguments
** Rites of integration: strengthen ties across individuals and groups
* Reflexive comments, explanations, justifications, and criticisms of actions:
** Plans: comments about anticipated actions
** Commentaries: comments about action in the present
** Accounts: comments about an action or event that has already occurred

== Intended effects ==
Numerous outcomes have been associated either directly or indirectly with organizational culture. The relationships between organizational culture and various outcomes include organizational performance, employee commitment, and innovation. A healthy and robust organizational culture is thought to offer various benefits, including:

* Competitive edge derived from innovation and customer service
* Consistent efficient employee performance
* Team cohesiveness
* High employee morale and job satisfaction
* Alignment towards goal achievement
* Increased member conscientiousness, leading to better compliance with procedures such as information security, and workplace safety

A Harvard Business School study reported that culture has a significant effect on an organization&#x27;s long-term economic performance. The study examined the management practices at 160 organizations over ten years and found that culture can impact performance. Performance-oriented cultures experienced better financial results. Additionally, a 2002 Corporate Leadership Council study found that cultural traits such as risk taking, internal communications, and flexibility are important drivers of performance. Furthermore, innovativeness, productivity through people, and other cultural factors cited by Peters and Waterman in &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; also have positive economic consequences.

Denison, Haaland, and Goelzer reported that culture contributes to the success of the organization, but not all dimensions contribute equally. Effects differed across nations, implying that organizational culture is rooted in national culture.

== Culture change ==
Cultures are not static and can evolve over time, either organically or through intentional change efforts by management. Culture change may be attempted to reduce member turnover, influence behavior, make improvements to the organization, reset objectives, rescale the organization, or achieve specific results.

=== Stages ===
Organizational cultures have been reported to change in stages. Organizational Communication professor Dave Logan proposed five stages:
*&quot;Life sucks&quot; (a subsystem severed from other functional systems; such as a tribe, gang or prison—2 percent of population);
*&quot;My life sucks&quot; (—25 percent of population);
*&quot;I&#x27;m great, and you&#x27;re not&quot; (—48 percent of population);
*&quot;We are great, but other groups suck&quot; (unification around more than individual competence—22 percent of population) and
*&quot;Life is great&quot; (3 percent of population).

=== Obstacles ===
Existing culture can hinder change efforts, especially where members understand the roles that they are supposed to play. Marquis et al. claimed that 70% of all change efforts fail because of the members. Organizational culture, and the structures in which they are embedded, often exhibit substantial inertia.

=== Methods ===
Change methodologies include Peter Senge&#x27;s concept of a &quot;learning organization&quot; expressed in &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; or &quot;Directive Communication&#x27;s&quot; &quot;corporate culture evolution&quot;.

Changing culture takes time. Members need time to get used to the new ways. Organizations with a strong and specific culture are harder to change.

Prior to introducing a cultural change, a needs assessment can characterize the existing culture. This involves some mixture of employ surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation, customer surveys, and other internal research. The company must then describe the new, desired culture, and then design a change process.

Cummings and Worley offer six guidelines for cultural change, in line with the eight distinct stages mentioned by Kotter.
* Formulate a strategic vision (Kotter stage 1, 2, and 3). A clear vision of the firm&#x27;s new strategy, shared values and behaviors provides direction for the culture change.
* Display top-management commitment (stage 4). Culture change must be managed from the top of the organization, as senior management&#x27;s willingness to change is an important indicator. Leadership must be strongly in favor of the change to implement the change. De Caluwé and Vermaak provide a framework with five different ways of thinking about change.
* Model change at the highest level (stage 5). In order to show that management wants the change, the change has to be visible and notable. Leadership needs to express the values and behaviors to be realized. It is important that leadership acknowledge the strengths of the current culture; it must be made clear that the culture needs adjustments rather than radical changes. This process may include creating committees, task forces, or value managers. Change agents communicate the new culture. They must embody courage, flexibility, interpersonal skills, organization knowledge, and patience. These individuals must be catalysts, rather than dictators.
* The fourth step is to modify the organization to support change. This includes identifying systems, policies, procedures and rules accordingly. This may include changes to accountability systems, compensation, benefits/reward structures, and recruitment and retention programs.
* Select and socialize newcomers and expel deviants (stage 7 and 8). A way to implement a change is to connect it to organizational membership. People may have to be selected and terminated in terms of their fit with the new culture. Encouraging employee motivation and loyalty is key and creates a healthy culture. Change managers must be able to connect the desired behavior and organizational success. Training must be provided to employees.
* Develop ethical and legal sensitivity. Changes in culture can lead to tensions between organizational and individual interests, which can create legal problems for practitioners. This is particularly relevant for changes in integrity, control, equitable treatment and job security. An evaluation process monitors progress and identifies areas that need further development. This step surfaces obstacles and resistant members, and acknowledges and rewards improvement, which encourages change. It may be necessary to incorporate new change managers, such as outside consultants. People often resist change, leaving it to leadership to convince people that gains outweigh losses. Besides institutionalization, reification is another process that tends to occur in strong cultures. The organization may come to be regarded as a source of pride, and even unique. The organization&#x27;s members develop a strong bond that transcends material returns, and begin to identify with it, turning the organization into a sort of clan.

== Research and models, cultural dimensions ==

Several methods have been used to classify organizational culture. While there is no single &quot;type&quot; of organizational culture and organizational cultures vary widely across organizations, researchers have developed models to describe different indicators of organizational cultures.

===Hofstede&#x27;s National Culture Dimensions ===
Hofstede looked for differences between over 160 000 IBM employees in 50 countries and three regions of the world, searching for aspects of culture that influence business behavior. He emphasized awareness of international differences and multiculturalism. Cultural differences reflect differences in thinking and social action, and in &quot;mental programs&quot;, a term Hofstede used for predictable behavior. Hofstede related culture to ethnic and regional differences, but also to the influence of organizations, professional, family, social and subcultural groups, national political systems, and legislation.

He suggested that changing &quot;mental programs&quot; involves changing behavior first, which then leads to value change. Though groups such as Jews and Gypsies have maintained their identity through centuries, their values reflect adaptation to the dominant cultural environment.

Hofstede described national and regional cultural groupings that affect the behavior of organizations and identified four dimensions of culture (later five) in his study of national cultures:

*Power distance – Societies adopt various approaches to social inequality. Although invisible, inside organizations&#x27; power inequality of the &quot;boss-subordinate relationships&quot; is functional. &quot;According to Mulder&#x27;s Power Distance Reduction theory subordinates will try to reduce the power distance between themselves and their bosses and bosses will try to maintain or enlarge it&quot;, but societies expect differences in power levels to exist.
*Uncertainty avoidance is a way of coping with uncertainty. Society copes using technology, law and religion/ritual, along either a rational (technology, law) or non-rational (religion/ritual). Hofstede cited rituals including memos and reports, some parts of accounting systems, parts of planning and control systems, and the invocation of experts.
*Individualism vs. collectivism – disharmony of personal and collective interests. Hofstede raised the idea that society&#x27;s expectations of Individualism/Collectivism are reflected by members. Collectivist societies have more emotional dependence; when in equilibrium an organization is expected to show responsibility to members. Individualist societies more often expect self-reliance. Some cultures have features of both.
*Masculinity vs. femininity – reflects whether a certain society emphasizes stereotypical male or female cultural values, gender roles and power relations.
* Long- versus short-term orientation – &quot;The long-term orientation dimension can be interpreted as dealing with society&#x27;s search for virtue. Societies with a short-term orientation generally have a strong concern with establishing the absolute Truth. They are normative in their thinking. They exhibit great respect for traditions, a relatively small propensity to save for the future, and a focus on achieving quick results. In societies with a long-term orientation, people believe that truth depends very much on situation, context and time. They show an ability to adapt traditions to changed conditions, a strong propensity to save and invest, thriftiness, and perseverance in achieving results.&quot;

These dimensions help define the effect of national cultures on management, and can be used to adapt to local needs.

=== Daniel Denison ===
Denison&#x27;s model assessed culture along four dimensions. Each divides into three sub-dimensions:

* Mission – Strategic Direction and Intent, Goals and Objectives and Vision
* Adaptability – Creating Change, Customer Focus and Organizational Learning
* Involvement – Empowerment, Team Orientation and Capability Development
* Consistency – Core Values, Agreement, Coordination/Integration

It separately assesses cultures along the dimensions of external/internal focus and flexible/stable evolution.

=== Deal and Kennedy ===
Deal and Kennedy characterized four types of organizations. Each focused on how quickly the organization processes along three dimensions:

* feedback
* member rewards
* risk.

*Work-hard, play-hard – Feedback: rapid; risk: low. Stress come from work quantity rather than uncertainty. High-speed action leading to high-speed recreation. Examples: Restaurants, software companies.
*Macho – Feedback: rapid; reward: rapid; risk:high. Stress comes from risk and potential reward loss/gain. Short-term focus. Examples– police, surgeons, sports.
*Process culture – Feedback: slow; reward: slow; risk: low. Low stress, plodding work, comfort and security. Stress comes from internal politics and bureaucracy. Examples: banks, insurance companies.
*Bet-the-company culture – Feedback: slow; reward: slow; risk: high. Stress comes from high risk and long payoff intervals. Detailed long-term planning. Examples: aircraft manufacturers, oil companies.

=== Artifacts, values, and tacit assumptions ===
Schein claimed that culture is the most difficult organizational attribute to change, outlasting products, services, founders and leadership and all physical attributes. His model considers culture as an observer, characterized in terms of artifacts, values and underlying assumptions.

Schein&#x27;s model considers attributes that can be experienced by the uninitiated observer – collectively known as &quot;artifacts&quot;. Included are facilities, offices, furnishings, visible awards and recognition, informal dress codes, member interactions with each other and with outsiders, and company slogans, mission statements and other creeds.

* Artifacts are physical elements that convey cultural meaning. Denison described artifacts as the tangible aspects of culture shared by members of an organization. Verbal, behavioral and physical artifacts are the surface manifestations of organizational culture. Technology and art exhibited by members of an organization are examples of physical artifacts. Rituals (myths, stories, and sagas) are artifacts that convey organizational history and influence member understanding of values and beliefs.
* Values direct individual behavior such as loyalty and customer orientation. Acceptance of stated values underlies impressions about trustworthiness and supportiveness, while also informing member behavior. This can be assessed by member interviews and surveys.
* Tacit assumptions are elements of culture that are not explicitly identified by members. Some elements may be taboo to discuss. Members may not have conscious knowledge of them. Nevertheless, they can influence member behavior. Interviews and surveys do not reveal them—much more in-depth assessment is required.

This model can enable understanding seemingly paradoxical behavior. For instance, an organization can profess high aesthetic and moral standards in terms of values, while violating those values should they conflict with tacit assumptions.

=== External adaptation and internal integration ===
Schein claimed that the two main reasons why cultures develop in organizations are external adaptation and internal integration. External adaptation helps an organization to flourish by affecting its culture. An appropriate culture holds the potential for generating sustained competitive advantage over external competitors.

Internal integration is an important function for establishing essential social structures and aiding socialization at the workplace. Culture-shaping factors include:
* External environment
* Industry
* Size and nature of the organization&#x27;s workforce
* Technologies the organization uses
* The organization&#x27;s history and ownership

=== Organizational structure, organizational culture ===
Organizational structure is linked to organizational culture. Harrison described four types of culture:

*Power culture – concentrates power among a small group or a central figure and its control radiates from its center like a web. Power cultures need few rules and little bureaucracy, but swift decisions can ensue.
*Role culture – authorities are delegated within a defined structure. These organizations form hierarchical bureaucracies, where power derives from personal position and rarely from expertise. Control is by procedures (which are highly valued), strict role descriptions and authority definitions. These organizations have consistent systems and are predictable. This culture is often represented by a &quot;Roman Building&quot; with &quot;pillars&quot;. These pillars represent the functional departments.
*Task culture – teams are formed to solve particular problems. Power is derived from the team with the expertise to complete a task. This culture uses a small team approach, where people are highly skilled and specialized in their own area of expertise. Additionally, these cultures often feature multiple reporting lines found in a matrix structure.
*Person culture: formed where all individuals believe themselves superior to the organization. It can become difficult for such organizations to operate, since the concept of an organization suggests that members are like-minded individuals who pursue common organizational goals. Some professional partnerships operate well as such cultures, because each partner brings a particular expertise and clientele to the group.

=== Cultural web ===

Johnson described a cultural web, identifying elements that can be used to describe/influence organizational culture:

*The paradigm – What the organization is about, what it does, its mission, its values.
*Control systems – Processes that monitor activity. Role cultures have vast rule-books. Power cultures rely on individualism.
*Organizational structure – Reporting lines, hierarchies, and the way that work flows through the organization.
*Power structures – Who makes the decisions, how widely spread is power, and on what is power based?
*Symbols – Organizational logos and designs, including symbols such as parking spaces and executive washroom keys.
*Rituals and routines – Management meetings, board reports...
*Stories and myths – narratives about people and events that convey values

These elements may overlap. Power structures may depend on control systems, which may exploit rituals that generate stories that may or may not be true.

=== Schemata ===

Schemata are knowledge structures derived from experience that simplify behavioral choices by providing a way to think about events. Schemata are created through interaction with others.
Harris described five categories of in-organization schemata necessary for organizational culture:

*Self-in-organization schema – individual self-concept relating to the organization, including personality, roles, and behavior
*Individual-in-organization schema – memories, impressions, and expectations of others
*Organization schema – a subset of individual schema: generalized perspective on others
*Object/concept-in-organization schema – organizational aspects
*Event-in-organization schema – knowledge of social events

These schemata represent an individual&#x27;s knowledge of the organization. Culture results when individual schemata become shared across an organization, primarily through organizational communication, reflecting shared knowledge and meaning.

=== Reciprocity ===
Adam Grant, author of &quot;Give and Take&quot;, highlights norms of reciprocity in analyzing culture. He distinguishes &quot;giver&quot;, &quot;taker&quot; and &quot;matcher&quot; cultures.

* Givers – employees operate by &quot;helping others, sharing knowledge, offering mentoring, and making connections without expecting anything in return&quot;
* Takers – &quot;get as much as possible from others while contributing less in return&quot; and winners are those who take the most and are able to build their power even at the expense of others.
* Matchers – match giving with taking, and trade favours mostly in closed loops.

In a study of the US intelligence system, giver cultures had the greatest group effectiveness.

Frank claimed that &quot;many organizations are essentially winner-take-all markets, dominated by zero-sum competitions for rewards and promotions&quot;. In particular, when leaders implement forced ranking systems to reward individual performance, giver cultures give way to taker or matcher cultures. Awarding the highest-performing individual within each team encourages a taker culture.

=== Entrepreneurial ===

McGuire&#x27;s model predicted revenue from new sources. An entrepreneurial organizational culture is a system of shared values, beliefs and norms, valuing creativity and tolerance, believing that innovating and seizing market opportunities are solutions to problems of survival and prosperity, environmental uncertainty, competition, and expects members to behave accordingly.

* People and empowerment focused
* Value creation through innovation and change
* Attention to basics
* Hands-on management
* Doing the right thing
* Freedom to grow and to fail
* Commitment and personal responsibility
* Emphasis on the future

=== Variable, process ===
Smircich described two approaches to studying organizational culture: as a variable and as a process. The former could be external or internal, encompassing values, norms, rituals, structures, principles, assumptions, and beliefs. National culture influences that variable.

Driskill and Brenton claimed that culture could be understood as shared cognition, systems of shared symbols, and as the expression of unconscious processes.

=== Organizational communication ===
The organizational communication perspective views culture as falling into three types:
* Traditional – views culture through stories, rituals, and symbols
* Interpretive – views culture through a network of shared meanings (members sharing subjective meanings)
* Critical-interpretive – views culture through a network of shared meanings as well as through power struggles created by competing meanings.

Rosauer observed organizational culture to be emergent – an incalculable state that results from the combination of various ingredients. In &quot;Three Bell Curves: Business Culture Decoded&quot;, he outlined three ingredients that he claimed guide business culture:

* employee (focus on engagement)
* work (focus on eliminating waste increasing value)
* customer (focus on likelihood of referral)

Improving these areas brings leadership, employees, work and customers together, improving culture and brand.

=== Other ===
Other frameworks include:

* Kets de Vries and Miller (1984): Paranoid, Avoidant, Charismatic, Bureaucratic, and Schizoid
* Mitroff and Kilmann (1975): Sensation thinking, Sensation feeling, Intuitive thinking, and Intuitive feeling
* Sethia and Von Gilnow in 1985: Caring, Apathetic, Integrative, and Exacting
* Deal and Kennedy (1982): organizational environment, core beliefs, heroes of the culture, folklore, myths, rites, rituals of culture, and the cultural network
* Ouchi and Jaeger (1978): type A (allows some decision making), J (tribal control), and Z (tribal decision making)
* McHale&#x27;s 4-stage Culture Disruptor: 1. Diagnose the deeply embedded patterns 2. Reframe role of the parts 3. Break the patterns 4. Consolidate one&#x27;s gains 

=== Instruments ===

==== Organizational Cultural Profile ====
O&#x27;Reilly, Chatman and Caldwell developed a model based on the belief that cultures can be distinguished by values. Their Organizational Cultural Profile (OCP) is a self-reporting tool that distinguishes eight categories:

* Innovation
* Supportiveness
* Stability
* Respect for People
* Outcome Orientation
* Attention to Detail
* Team Orientation
* Aggressiveness.

The instrument can measure how culture affects performance, as it discerns persons most suited to an organization and such organizations have an effective culture. Takeda claimed that such instruments can measure both person-situation fit and person-culture fit. Such measurements assess the level of  compatibility between employees and companies. Employee values are measured against organizational values to predict employee turnover.

==== Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument ====
Cameron and Quinn developed the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) that distinguishes four culture types, based on the Competing Values Framework.

Competing values can be assessed along dimensions of flexibility/stability and internal/external focus – they reported these to be the most important in influencing organizational success. These dimensions enable a quadrant of four culture types:

* Clan culture is flexible/internally focused.
* Adhocracy culture is flexible/externally focused. 
* Market culture is stable/externally focused.
* Hierarchy culture is stable/internally focused.

==== Organizational Culture Inventory ====
Cooke defined culture as behaviors that members believe are required to fit in and meet expectations. The Organizational Culture Inventory measures twelve behavioral norms grouped into three culture types:

* Constructive cultures – Members are encouraged to interact with people and approach tasks in ways that help them meet their higher-order satisfaction needs.
* Passive/defensive cultures – Members believe they must interact with people in ways that will not threaten their own security.
* Aggressive/defensive cultures – Members are expected to approach tasks forcefully to protect their status and security.

==Critical views==
Criticism of &quot;organizational culture&quot; began in the early 1980s. Most criticism comes from writers in critical management studies who for example express skepticism about functionalist and unitarist views. They stress the ways in which these assumptions can stifle dissent and reproduce propaganda and ideology. They suggest that organizations do not embody a single culture (diversity), and cultural engineering may not reflect the interests of all stakeholders.

Parker suggested that many of the assumptions surrounding organizational culture are not new. They reflect a long-standing tension between cultural and structural (or informal and formal) versions of organizations. Further, it is reasonable to suggest that complex organizations might have many cultures, and that such sub-cultures might overlap and contradict each other. The neat typologies of cultural forms found in textbooks rarely acknowledge such complexities, or the various economic contradictions that exist in capitalist organizations.

Smircich criticized theories that attempt to categorize or &#x27;pigeonhole&#x27; organizational culture. She applied the metaphor of a plant root to represent culture, saying that it drives organizations rather than vice versa. Organizations are the product of their organizational culture, which shapes behavior and interaction. While Schein&#x27;s underlying assumptions are that beliefs, perceptions, thoughts, and feelings are taken for granted and can be observed and considered the ultimate source of values and action. However, such assumptions undermine attempts to categorize and define organizational culture.
===Legal liability===
In the US, corporate culture can legally be found to be a cause of injuries and a reason for fining companies, such as when the US Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration levied a fine of more than US$10.8 million on Performance Coal Co. following the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in April 2010. This was the largest fine in the history of this agency.

===Subcultures===
Groups within the organization may act according to their own subcultures that are not fully aligned with that of the organization as a whole. For example, computer technicians will have expertise, language and behaviors gained independently of the organization, but their presence can influence the culture of the larger organization.

=== Shadow side ===
Egan and Tate speak of organizations having a &quot;shadow side&quot;, which Egan defined as:
Tate describes the shadow side as the &quot;often disagreeable, messy, crazy and opaque aspects of [an] organisation&#x27;s personality&quot;.

<text>[[Performance]] improvement is measuring the output of a particular business process or procedure, then modifying the process or procedure to increase the output, increase efficiency, or increase the effectiveness of the process or procedure. Performance improvement can be applied to either individual performance, such as an athlete, or organisational performance, such as a racing team or a commercial business.

The United States Coast Guard has published the &quot;Performance Improvement Guide (PIG)&quot;, which describes various processes and tools for performance management at the individual and organisational levels.

== Organisational development ==
In organisational development, performance improvement is an organisational change in which the managers and governing body of an organisation put into place and manage a program which measures the current level of performance of the organisation. It then generates ideas for modifying organisational behaviour and infrastructure which are put into place to achieve higher output. At the organisational level, performance improvement usually involves softer forms of measurement such as customer satisfaction surveys which are used to obtain qualitative information about performance from the viewpoint of customers.

The primary goals of organisational improvement are to increase organisational effectiveness and efficiency to improve the ability of the organisation to deliver goods and or services. A third area sometimes targeted for improvement is organisational efficacy, which involves the process of setting organisational goals and objectives. Performance improvement can occur at different levels: an individual performer, a team, an organisational unit, or the organisation itself.

=== Corporate or commercial ===
In business, human performance in sales, operations and employee engagement needs to be improved through psychologically rewarding experiences &quot;which can trigger a host of intrinsic human emotions and behaviour&quot; as identified by Maslow. Including rewards in a performance, improvement solution is a proven strategy to engage employees and align them with the company&#x27;s goals. Stimulating awards can be cash or non-cash. The addition of non-cash awards to the total rewards package may bring out the performance potential of people because it separates a reward from being used as or perceived as ordinary salary income. Non-cash awards are thought to motivate higher achievement of and drive greater returns on investment. Cash as a reward can also be spent on day-to-day items like food or gas and does not create the increased &quot;psychological reward&quot; of achieving special items or points to acquire items. By connecting with all levels of the organisation, a complete reward package may amplify performance across the organisation and bring personal goals into alignment with organisational goals,&quot; according to Maritz, LLC. Reward programs supporting improvement in sales and operations can be effectively paid for from the increase in revenue or profits which flow from the program, and without spending to reward for your current levels.

There is evidence that monetary rewards are not effective outside the context of very rote work. In some cases, monetary incentive plans may decrease employee morale, as in Microsoft&#x27;s stack-ranking system, where the total reward amount is fixed and employees are graded on an artificially fitted distribution.

=== Performance improvement plans ===

If an employee&#x27;s performance is unsatisfactory, the employer may set out a performance improvement plan (PIP) to help the employee improve. This may be because the employee is failing to meet the goals for their role or due to other problems such as poor behavior or interpersonal skills. A PIP is usually a written document and it should clarify expectations for the employee, articulate how the employee is failing to meet them, lay out what improvements are expected, explain whether and how managers will support the employee in improving and indicate what the consequences will be if the employee fails to improve. The expected improvements should be specific and measurable and consequences for failing to meet them might include a transfer, demotion or termination.

Typically, the employee&#x27;s manager and someone from human resources would meet with the employee to discuss the PIP. According to Donald L. Kirkpatrick, a PIP should be developed by the manager and the employee together, because it requires both of their participation in order to be successful. The American Society for Human Resource Management recommends that &quot;a PIP should be used when there is a commitment to help the employee improve&quot;, not just as a way to prepare to terminate the employee, but some companies do use PIPs simply as a way to start a termination.

== Methods ==
Performance is an abstract concept and must be represented by concrete, measurable goals or objectives. For example, baseball athlete performance is abstract as it covers many different types of activities. Batting average is a concrete measure of a particular performance attribute for a particular game role, batting, for the game of baseball.

Performance assumes an actor of some kind but the actor could be an individual person or a group of people acting in concert. The performance platform is the infrastructure or devices used in the performance act.

There are two main ways to improve performance: improving the measured attribute by using the performance platform more effectively, or by improving the measured attribute by modifying the performance platform, which in turn allows a given level of use to be more effective in producing the desired output.

For instance, in several sports such as tennis and golf, there have been technological improvements in the apparatuses used. The improved apparatus in turn allows players to achieve better performance with no improvement in skill by purchasing new equipment. The apparatus, the golf club and golf ball or the tennis racket, provide the player with a higher theoretical performance limit.

Performance is a measure of the results achieved. Performance efficiency is the ratio between effort expended and results achieved. The difference between current performance and the theoretical performance limit is the performance improvement zone.

Another way to think of performance improvement is to see it as improvement in four potential areas:
# input requirements; e.g. working capital, material, replacement or reorder time, and set-up requirements.
# throughput requirements, often viewed as process efficiency; this is measured in terms of time, waste, and resource utilisation.
# output requirements, often viewed from a cost/price, quality, functionality perspective.
# outcome requirements; i.e. did it end up making a difference.

=== Cycle ===
Business performance management and improvement can be thought of as a cycle:
# Performance planning where goals and objectives are established.
# Performance coaching where a manager intervenes to give feedback and adjust performance.
# Performance appraisal where individual performance is formally documented and feedback delivered.

=== Behaviour modification ===

In his study of innate human needs, psychologist Abraham Maslow in his concept of a hierarchy of needs identified esteem and social fulfillment, garnered by recognition by family and peers, as a basic human need, and therefore able to be tied to structured programs that increase performance. Abraham Maslow, on “Third Force” psychology, combines aspects of behavioural, cognitive, and emotional psychology, and accounts for the impact of culture and society on behaviour.

<text>A performance appraisal, also referred to as a performance review, performance evaluation, (career) development discussion, or employee appraisal, sometimes shortened to &quot;PA&quot;, is a periodic and systematic process whereby the job performance of an employee is documented and evaluated. This is done after employees are trained about work and settle into their jobs. Performance appraisals are a part of career development and consist of regular reviews of employee performance within organizations.

Performance appraisals are most often conducted by an employee&#x27;s immediate manager or line manager. While extensively practiced, annual performance reviews have also been criticized as providing feedback too infrequently to be useful, and some critics argue that performance reviews in general do more harm than good. It is an element of the principal-agent framework, that describes the relationship of information between the employer and employee, and in this case the direct effect and response received when a performance review is conducted.

==Main features==
A performance appraisal is a systematic, general and periodic process that assesses an individual employee&#x27;s job performance and productivity in relation to certain pre-established criteria and organizational objectives. Other aspects of individual employees are considered as well, such as organizational citizenship behavior, accomplishments, potential for future improvement, strengths and weaknesses, etc.

To collect PA data, there are three main methods: objective production, personnel, and judgmental evaluation. Judgmental evaluations are the most commonly used with a large variety of evaluation methods. Historically, PA has been conducted annually (long-cycle appraisals); however, many companies are moving towards shorter cycles (every six months, every quarter), and some have been moving into short-cycle (weekly, bi-weekly) PA. The interview could function as &quot;providing feedback to employees, counseling and developing employees, and conveying and discussing compensation, job status, or disciplinary decisions&quot;. PA is often included in performance management systems. PA helps the subordinate answer two key questions: first, &quot;What are your expectations of me?&quot; second, &quot;How am I doing to meet your expectations?&quot;

Performance management systems are employed &quot;to manage and align&quot; all of an organization&#x27;s resources in order to achieve highest possible performance and to eliminate distractions procured from individual agents that neglect the companies goals. &quot;How performance is managed in an organization determines to a large extent the success or failure of the organization. Therefore, improving PA for everyone should be among the highest priorities of contemporary organizations&quot;.

Some applications of PA are compensation, performance improvement, promotions, termination, test validation, and more. While there are many potential benefits of PA, there are also some potential drawbacks. For example, PA can help facilitate management-employee communication; however, PA may result in legal issues if not executed appropriately, as many employees tend to be unsatisfied with the PA process, as well as, the misuse of PA&#x27;s can incur apathy towards organizational goals and values. PAs created in and determined as useful in the United States are not necessarily able to be transferable cross-culturally.

=== Use of Performance Appraisal Results ===

Performance appraisals (PAs) have wide-ranging uses in organizations across sectors and are intended to serve various purposes including:

Performance improvement

Employee performance improvement is considered a central purpose of PAs that contributes to enhancing organizational effectiveness. Due to greater demand for transparency, accountability, and effective public service delivery. PAs in public sector organizations help identify strengths and weaknesses, and development opportunities that algin employees&#x27; efforts with organizational and public service goals, while enabling public sector employees to adjust their performance in order to foster a more effective government workforce.

Informing employment decisions

PAs are used to inform employment decisions such as promotion, termination, and transfer of employees. Transparent and objective PAs can help ensure fairness in these employment decisions as well as help identify high-potential employees from groups that may be more traditionally excluded, thus, contributing to career progression and, at the same time, increasing diversity in leadership positions.

From a labor union perspective, PAs should be embedded within fair and culturally sensitive appraisal systems and should not reinforce managerial bias or justify unfair terminations or promotions, particularly for employees of indigenous background, women, and ethnic minorities that are often at greater risk of being unfairly evaluated due to unconscious bias or inequitable standards.

The use of multisource feedback – incorporating evaluations from peers, subordinates, and customers to provide a holistic view – over traditional supervisory ratings may assist to improve rating accuracy by reducing leniency bias and centrality bias where raters may give overly positive evaluations or avoid extreme ratings, respectively.

Organizational research, tools and practices

Research shows that effective PAs are reliable indicators of employee competencies and future job performance. In public sector organizations that serve diverse populations, inclusive PAs can contribute to better hiring practices and employee development programs. Labor unions emphasize that these systems should reflect collective efforts rather than focusing solely on individual accomplishments, as collaboration is key in creating an inclusive public workforce.

Communication

PAs are used as mechanisms for feedback, to clarify job expectations and organizational goals, and to prevent misunderstandings that may arise, including those stemming from cultural differences. Transparent appraisal systems also reduce the risk of surprise negative evaluations, a concern especially pertinent for socially excluded groups that may already face systemic bias in the workplace.

Research has found that face-to-face discussions and continuous feedback help improve the performance appraisal process by enhancing clarity and mutual understanding.

Development and training

PAs can assist in identifying training needs and setting professional development goals fostering both individual growth and a more skilled workforce at an organizational level.

Cognitive biases such as the anchoring effect and halo effect can impact the accuracy of appraisals used to identify training and professional development needs by relying too heavily on initial information (anchor) when making judgments; or a rater&#x27;s overall positive impression of an individual, both of which can influence the assessment of performance, leading to biased judgments that influence evaluations.

Documenting performance

PAs serve the purpose of documenting appraisal processes and results – essential in public sector organizations, where accountability to citizens and legal regulations is required. Proper documentation ensures performance is recorded transparently, safeguarding all parties in case of disputes around wrongful termination or discrimination.

Labor unions advocate that such documentation should be accessible to employees and their representatives, ensuring that vulnerable employees are protected from biased evaluations.

Reward systems

PAs are often used to determine salary levels and rewards placing a greater emphasis on the need for transparency in how compensation decisions are made.

Research has found that clear communication of performance metrics, management support, and fair reward distribution are essential for successful reward implementation.

Job evaluation and selection

Performance appraisals also assist in formulating job criteria and selecting individuals suited for specific tasks. By identifying key competencies, PAs help ensure that recruitment and selection processes are inclusive, enabling public sector organizations to meet the needs of diverse communities.

Motivation

PAs serve as critical tools for motivating employees. In the public sector, where intrinsic motivators such as public service motivation often drive performance, PAs can enhance motivation by recognizing the contributions of employees and providing them with growth opportunities. Public sector unions emphasize the importance of non-monetary rewards, such as career development or increased responsibility, which can be particularly meaningful for employees from groups that more traditionally suffer from social exclusion, as these provide pathways to leadership and broader representation.

===Potential benefits===
There are a number of potential benefits of organizational performance management conducting formal performance appraisals (PAs). There has been a general consensus in the belief that PAs lead to positive implications of organizations. Furthermore, PAs can benefit an organization&#x27;s effectiveness. One way is PAs can often lead to giving individual workers feedback about their job performance. From this may spawn several potential benefits such as the individual workers becoming more productive.

Other potential benefits include:

*Facilitation of communication: communication in organizations is considered an essential function of worker motivation. It has been proposed that feedback from PAs aid in minimizing employees&#x27; perceptions of uncertainty. Fundamentally, feedback and management-employee communication can serve as a guide in job performance.
*Enhancement of employee focus through promoting trust: behaviors, thoughts, or other issues may distract employees from their work, and trust issues may be among these distracting factors. Such factors that consume psychological energy can lower job performance and cause workers to lose sight of organizational goals. Properly constructed and utilized PAs have the ability to lower distracting factors and encourage trust within the organization.
*Goal setting and desired performance reinforcement: organizations find it efficient to match individual worker&#x27;s goals and performance with organizational goals. PAs provide room for discussion in the collaboration of these individual and organizational goals. Collaboration can also be advantageous by resulting in employee acceptance and satisfaction of appraisal results.
*Performance improvement: well constructed PAs can be valuable tools for communication with employees as pertaining to how their job performance stands with organizational expectations. &quot;At the organizational level, numerous studies have reported positive relationships between human resource management (HRM) practices&quot; and performance improvement at both the individual and organizational levels.
*Determination of training needs: &quot;Employee training and development are crucial components in helping an organization achieve strategic initiatives&quot;. It has been argued that for PAs to truly be effective, post-appraisal opportunities for training and development in problem areas, as determined by the appraisal, must be offered. PAs can be especially instrumental for identifying training needs of new employees. Finally, PAs can help in the establishment and supervision of employees&#x27; career goals.

===Potential complications===

Despite all the potential advantages of formal performance appraisals (PAs), there are also potential drawbacks. It has been noted that determining the relationship between individual job performance and organizational performance can be a difficult task. The ones conducting performance appraisals, such as line managers also often face complexities. Generally, there are two overarching problems from which several complications spawn. One of the problems with formal PAs is there can be detrimental effects to the organization(s) involved if the appraisals are not used appropriately. The second problem with formal PAs is they can be ineffective if the PA system does not correspond with the organizational culture and system.

Potential complications that may arise:
*Detrimental impact to performance improvement: It has been proposed that the use of PA systems in organizations adversely affects organizations&#x27; pursuits of quality performance. It is believed by some scholars and practitioners that the use of PAs is unnecessary if there is total quality management.
*Subjective evaluations: Subjectivity is related to judgement based on a supervisor&#x27;s subjective impressions and opinions, which can be expressed through the use of subjective performance measures, &quot;ex post&quot; flexibility in the weighting of objective performance measures, or &quot;ex post&quot; discretional adjustment, all of which are based on factors other than performance measures specified &quot;ex ante&quot;. Traditional performance appraisals are often based upon a manager&#x27;s or supervisor&#x27;s perceptions of an employee&#x27;s performance and employees are evaluated subjectively rather than objectively. Therefore, the review may be influenced by many non-performance factors such as employee &#x27;likeability&#x27;, personal prejudices, ease of management, and previous mistakes or successes. Reviews should instead be based on data-supported, measurable behaviors and results within the performers control.
*Negative perceptions: &quot;Quite often, individuals have negative perceptions of PAs&quot;. Receiving, or the anticipation of receiving, a PA can be uncomfortable and distressful and potentially cause &quot;tension between supervisors and subordinates&quot;. If the person being appraised does not trust their employer, appraiser or believe that they will benefit from the process it may become a &quot;tick box&quot; exercise.
*Central tendency: This is where the evaluator fails to make extreme ratings to either direction-low or high but remains at the intermediate. The evaluator fails to use extremes of the scale and uses the central points e.g. rating all employees as average.
*Inflationary pressure: This is where there is low differentiation with the upper range of the rating choices defining outstanding performance as 90 or above good as 90 or above, average or above 70 or above and inadequate performance as anything below 70 leaves one wonder for a promotion. 
*Errors: Performance appraisals should provide accurate and relevant ratings of an employee&#x27;s performance as compared to pre-established criteria/goals (i.e. organizational expectations). Nevertheless, supervisors will sometimes rate employees more favorably than that of their true performance in order to please the employees and avoid conflict. &quot;Inflated ratings are a common malady associated with formal&quot; PA.
*Legal issues: When PAs are not carried out appropriately, legal issues could result that place the organization at risk. PAs are used in organizational disciplinary programs as well as for promotional decisions within the organization. The improper application and utilization of PAs can affect employees negatively and lead to legal action against the organization.
*Performance goals: Performance goals and PA systems are often used in association. Negative outcomes concerning the organizations can result when goals are overly challenging or overemphasized to the extent of affecting ethics, legal requirements, or quality. Moreover, challenging performance goals can impede an employee&#x27;s abilities to acquire necessary knowledge and skills. Especially in the early stages of training, it would be more beneficial to instruct employees on outcome goals than on performance goals.
*Derail merit pay or performance-based pay: Some researchers contend that the deficit in merit pay and performance-based pay is linked to the fundamental issues stemming from PA systems.

===Improvements===

Although performance appraisals can be biased, there are certain steps that can be taken to improve the evaluations and reduce the margin of errors through the following:

:* &quot;Training&quot; – Bringing awareness to the potential for bias by training the Evaluators to be aware of the difference of skills and abilities between employees and how to subjectively consider these traits.
:* &quot;Providing feedback to raters&quot; – Trained raters provide managers who evaluated their subordinates with feedback, including information on ratings from other managers. This has the potential to reduce leniency errors.
:* &quot;Subordinate participation&quot; – By allowing employee participation in the evaluation process, there is employee-supervisor reciprocity in the discussion for any discrepancies between self ratings and supervisor ratings, thus, increasing job satisfaction and motivation.
:* Use multiple raters to avoid the likely bias with using only one rater.
:* Conduct post appraisal interviews. interview employees after appraisal to get their comments, views and opinions on the whole exercise and general performance.
:* Use selective rating. Use people as raters on areas where they have job knowledge since no single person is knowledgeable in all areas.
:* Reward accurate appraisers. It is good practice to reward performance and hence it means those who appraise accurately have performed and should be rewarded.

===Effectiveness===
Leadership development coach Jack Zenger urges companies to find alternatives to annual performance reviews, and says that research supports the following:
* Frequent discussions with employees are better than annual reviews
* Talking about future goals is more productive than past performance, especially with clear targets, deadlines, and the participation of the employee
* Negative feedback can cause defensiveness and worsen productivity
* Positive feedback does little to improve productivity, though does improve the interpersonal relationship with the person giving the feedback
* Neither managers nor employees like performance reviews
* Higher-level employees receive performance reviews less frequently
* Annual reviews are often justified on the grounds they are needed for salary changes, but they are not actually necessary, and empirically they would make little difference for most employees

Labor union contracts often include seniority provisions, specifying that promotions, layoffs, and benefits are determined based on the length of service rather than performance. Historically, these provisions aimed to prevent favoritism, cronyism, and corruption, promoting a sense of solidarity among workers. Seniority serves as job security, protecting long-serving employees from arbitrary layoffs or demotions. It is commonly seen in sectors like manufacturing, education, and public services, offering employees a predictable path to career advancement and rewards.

====The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) Rule====
A common application of seniority is the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) rule, which dictates that employees with the shortest tenure are laid off first during downsizing. This system provides stability for longer-serving employees and is considered fair in workforce reductions. However, critics argue that LIFO can hinder productivity by retaining employees based solely on tenure, regardless of their current performance or skills. For example, in technology-driven industries, newer employees may possess valuable skills or innovative approaches that senior workers might lack. As such, organizations sometimes face difficulties maintaining a competitive edge when LIFO rules limit their ability to retain high-performing but less-tenured staff. Nevertheless, the LIFO rule remains a vital aspect of many union agreements, particularly in traditional industries where seniority is highly valued.

====Seniority&#x27;s Impact on Wages and Promotions====
Seniority significantly influences wage structures and promotions, often resulting in a wage premium for employees with longer tenures. Union-negotiated contracts may include regular wage increases based solely on years of service. This approach can enhance job satisfaction and loyalty, as employees feel rewarded for their long-term commitment. However, this system may also lead to inefficiencies if individual performance and skills are overlooked. High-performing employees with shorter tenures might feel demotivated if they see senior colleagues receiving higher wages and opportunities simply due to their length of service. This structure can also impose financial burdens on organizations during economic downturns, as they must continue paying higher wages to senior employees regardless of business performance. To address these issues, some companies have implemented hybrid wage systems that combine seniority with performance-based incentives, allowing them to recognize both experience and merit.

====Balancing Seniority and Performance====
While seniority offers job security and a sense of fairness, it also presents challenges in modern workplaces. To address this, many labor contracts have adopted flexible seniority systems, where an employee’s abilities, skills, and job performance are also considered alongside their tenure. For example, companies might use performance reviews to guide decisions related to promotions, salary increases, and even layoffs. This approach allows employers to respect seniority while ensuring that productivity and contributions to the organization are fairly acknowledged.

Union rules may also include probationary periods and warnings as mechanisms to balance seniority with performance. Employers are often required to warn poorly performing employees and give them a probationary period to improve before considering dismissal. During disputes, records from performance reviews and probation periods often play a crucial role in arbitration, helping to determine whether a firing was justified. This structured process ensures that performance issues are managed fairly without undermining the seniority system&#x27;s core principles.

====Recent Trends and Debates====
In recent years, some organizations have increasingly questioned traditional seniority-based approaches, arguing that they can stifle innovation and adaptability, especially in fast-paced markets like technology and healthcare. This has led to a push for more performance-oriented contracts that still incorporate elements of seniority to ensure a balanced approach. Mixed evaluation systems, combining seniority with performance metrics, human resource metrics, skills assessments, and peer feedback, are becoming more popular. These systems aim to balance the stability provided by seniority with the need for a dynamic, merit-based workforce. The ongoing debate reflects the complexities of modern labor relations and the need for adaptive strategies that can meet diverse business needs.

====Finding the Balance in Seniority Systems====
Seniority in labor contracts remains a complex issue. It offers job security and guards against favoritism but also poses challenges in balancing merit and productivity. Modern labor contracts increasingly seek a middle ground, integrating seniority provisions with performance-based assessments to create a fair and efficient work environment. By valuing both experience and performance, organizations can foster a culture that recognizes long-term loyalty while also rewarding high achievers. This balanced approach is key to building a workforce that is both stable and dynamic, capable of meeting the demands of a rapidly changing economy. The evolving nature of workplaces makes finding this balance more important than ever.

===Resistance from managers===

Managers who have had unsatisfactory experiences with inadequate or poorly designed appraisal programs may be skeptical about their usefulness. Academic literature has also been unable to appropriately define exclusive measure of PA effectiveness. The skepticism is also reflected in the decline in the use of traditional PA processes in the U.S. corporate sector. It is estimate of a third of the U.S. private companies have now switched to a more informal and frequent engagement between managers and employees to enhance performance. The shift is attributed to a greater focus on talent development, business agility, and a preference for teamwork over individual responsibility.

The government and public sector organizations continue to use PA worldwide. In the 2005 Merit Performance Survey (MPS) conducted by the United States (U.S.) Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), 16.41% of federal supervisors reported that they had rated their employees&#x27; PAs either higher or lower than the employees should have received. Among nine potential problems identified in the 2005 MPS on structure and operation of the U.S. federal government appraisal system; inflated ratings, flawed standards, and lack of support were ranked as the top three problems, respectively.

==== Inflated Ratings ====
Occurs when employees receive higher-than-expected performance ratings due to systematic bias by raters when conducting PA. This consequently affect the effectiveness of PA evaluations due to the impact of halo effect and anchoring effect on PA rating. Research shows that managers tend to give better ratings to subordinates they favor, influenced by both direct bias and indirect bias. Inflated ratings are more common when PAs are conducted for judgmental and administrative purposes, such as promotions, pay increases, or job retention, rather than for developmental reasons.

Research studies have identified various factors contributing to inflated ratings. First, raters may be lenient to avoid administrative burdens, such as compiling documentation to justify low ratings. This could be because managers view PAs as time-consuming and routine tasks. Second, raters may hesitate to give harsh ratings to avoid damaging work relationships and creating an unproductive environment.

Recent HRM studies also suggest raters’ experiences cognitive bias influenced by contextual factors, such as institutional, political, and cultural influences, as well as environmental factors. For instance, an environmental, such as, a national crisis can impair raters to rely on heuristic thinking rather than making an objective and cognitive evaluation of subordinates PA, as described by dual-process theory.

Third, the perceived importance of accurate PA ratings may be positively influenced by motivational factors, such as felt accountability, incentive structures, and public service motivation. Finally, close relationships between raters and subordinates can also lead to inflated ratings. For example, a line manager who regularly engages with subordinates may develop strong interpersonal relationships, which can impair objective evaluation.

Flawed performance standards or measures are attributed to the use of subjective criteria or ambiguous measures by raters during PAs. One cause of this issue is the difficulty in defining objective performance standards due to the complexity of job tasks or outcomes. This challenge may be influenced by how organizations structure their employees&#x27; duties. Factors such as job autonomy, teamwork, and job rotation affect the setting of performance standards, and in some cases, subjective criteria may be necessary due to the nature of the job. For example, empirical findings suggest that subordinates with a high degree of job autonomy may have a positive relationship with the inclusion of subjective measures in their PA, due to the variation of day-to-day job tasks need to meet performance targets and provided there is frequent level monitoring by their line managers.

Clear performance standards are shaped by well-defined organizational goals. The absence of clear goals and targets can disrupt goal alignment, which affects the effectiveness of PAs in monitoring and managing how employees&#x27; work contributes to organizational priorities. Organizational goals provide employees with a clear line of sight, helping them understand how their duties contribute to organizational performance. A study suggests that PAs help moderate the relationship between employee alignment and organizational performance. Government departments and public service organizations often face challenges in developing clear organizational goals, which makes it further challenging for managers evaluate the performance of subordinates based on individual performance goals that are not clearly aligned to organizational goals.

Lack of support from higher management can undermine raters&#x27; confidence and their ability to conduct employee PA effectively, which can compromise the independence and integrity of PA decision-making. Employees often rely on higher management to validate the organization&#x27;s decisions. When higher management emphasizes the importance of PAs by providing endorsements, resources, training, and time for participation, it can motivate raters to be more accountable and thorough in conducting accurate appraisals. However, political and institutional factors, such as, political ideologies, norms, and organizational culture can influence the effective implementation of PA outcomes.

==Conducting==
Human resource management (HRM) conducts performance management. Performance management systems consist of the activities and processes embraced by an organization in anticipation of improving employee performance, and therefore, organizational performance. Consequently, performance management is conducted at the organizational level and the individual level. At the organizational level, performance management oversees organizational performance and compares present performance with organizational performance goals. The achievement of these organizational performance goals depends on the performance of the individual organizational members. Therefore, measuring individual employee performance can prove to be a valuable performance management process for the purposes of HRM and for the organization. Many researchers would argue that &quot;performance appraisal is one of the most important processes in Human Resource Management&quot;.

The performance management process begins with leadership within the organization creating a performance management policy. Primarily, management governs performance by influencing employee performance input (e.g. training programs) and by providing feedback via output (i.e. performance assessment and appraisal). &quot;The ultimate objective of a performance management process is to align individual performance with organizational performance&quot;. A very common and central process of performance management systems is performance appraisal (PA). The PA process should be able to inform employees about the &quot;organization&#x27;s goals, priorities, and expectations and how well they are contributing to them&quot;.

==Frequency of PAs==

Performance appraisals (PAs) are conducted at least annually, and annual employee performance reviews appear to be the standard in most American organizations. However, &quot;it has been acknowledged that appraisals conducted more frequently (more than once a year) may have positive implications for both the organization and employee.&quot; It is suggested that regular performance feedback provided to employees may quell any unexpected or surprising feedback to year-end discussions. In a recent research study concerning the timeliness of PAs, &quot;one of the respondents even suggested that the performance review should be done formally and more frequently, perhaps once a month, and recorded twice a year.&quot;

Other researchers propose that the purpose of PAs and the frequency of their feedback are contingent upon the nature of the job and characteristics of the employee. For example, employees of routine jobs where performance maintenance is the goal would benefit sufficiently from annual PA feedback. On the other hand, employees of more discretionary and non-routine jobs, where goal-setting is appropriate and there is room for development, would benefit from more frequent PA feedback. Informal performance appraisals may be done more often, to prevent the element of surprise from the formal appraisal.

==Methods of collecting data==

There are three main methods used to collect performance appraisal (PA) data: objective production, personnel, and judgmental evaluation. Judgmental evaluations are the most commonly used with a large variety of evaluation methods.

===Objective production===

The objective production method consists of direct, but limited, measures such as sales figures, production numbers, the electronic performance monitoring of data entry workers, etc. The measures used to appraise performance would depend on the job and its duties. Although these measures deal with unambiguous criteria, they are usually incomplete because of criterion contamination and criterion deficiency. Criterion contamination refers to the part of the actual criteria that is unrelated to the conceptual criteria. In other words, the variability in performance can be due to factors outside of the employee&#x27;s control. Criterion deficiency refers to the part of the conceptual criteria that is not measured by the actual criteria. In other words, the quantity of production does not necessarily indicate the quality of the products. Both types of criterion inadequacies result in reduced validity of the measure. Regardless of the fact that objective production data is not a complete reflection upon job performance, such data is relevant to job performance.

====Happy-productive worker hypothesis====

The happy-productive worker hypothesis states that the happiest workers are the most productive performers, and the most productive performers are the happiest workers. Yet, after decades of research, the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance produces only a weak positive correlation. Published in 2001 by &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot;, a meta-analysis of 312 research studies produced an uncorrected correlation of 0.18. This correlation is much weaker than what the happy-productive worker hypothesis would predict.

===Personnel===

The personnel method is the recording of withdrawal behaviors (i.e. absenteeism, accidents). Most organizations consider unexcused absences to be indicators of poor job performance, even with all other factors being equal; however, this is subject to criterion deficiency. The quantity of an employee&#x27;s absences does not reflect how dedicated that employee may be to the job and its duties. Especially for blue-collar jobs, accidents can often be a useful indicator of poor job performance, but this is also subject to criterion contamination because situational factors also contribute to accidents. Once again, both types of criterion inadequacies result in reduced validity of the measure. Although excessive absenteeism or accidents often indicate poor job performance rather than good performance, such personnel data is not a comprehensive reflection of an employee&#x27;s performance.

===Judgmental evaluation===
Judgmental evaluation appears to be a collection of methods, and as such, could be considered a methodology. A common approach to obtaining PAs is by means of raters. Because the raters are human, some error will always be present in the data. The most common types of error are leniency errors, central tendency errors, and errors resulting from the halo effect. Halo effect is characterized by the tendency to rate a person who is exceptionally strong in one area higher than deserved in other areas. It is the opposite of the Horns effect, where a person is rated as lower than deserved in other areas due to an extreme deficiency in a single discipline. These errors arise predominantly from social cognition and the theory in that how we judge and evaluate other individuals in various contexts is associated with how we &quot;acquire, process, and categorize information&quot;.

An essential piece of this method is rater training. Rater training is the &quot;process of educating raters to make more accurate assessments of performance, typically achieved by reducing the frequency of halo, leniency, and central-tendency errors&quot;. Rater training also helps the raters &quot;develop a common frame of reference for evaluation&quot; of individual performance. Many researchers and survey respondents support the ambition of effectual rater training. However, it is noted that such training is expensive, time-consuming, and only truly functional for behavioral assessments.

Another piece to keep in mind is the effects of rater motivation on judgmental evaluations. It is not uncommon for rating inflation to occur due to rater motivation (i.e. &quot;organizationally induced pressures that compel raters to evaluate ratees positively&quot;). Typically, raters are motivated to give higher ratings because of the lack of organizational sanction concerning accurate/inaccurate appraisals, the rater&#x27;s desire to guarantee promotions, salary increases, etc., the rater&#x27;s inclination to avoid negative reactions from subordinates, and the observation that higher ratings of the ratees reflect favorably upon the rater.

The main methods used in judgmental performance appraisal are:

*Graphic rating scale: graphic rating scales are the most commonly used system in PA. On several different factors, subordinates are judged on &#x27;how much&#x27; of that factor or trait they possess. Typically, the raters use a 5- or 7-point scale; however, there are as many as 20-point scales.
*Employee-comparison methods: rather than subordinates being judged against pre-established criteria, they are compared with one another. This method eliminates central tendency and leniency errors but still allows for halo effect errors to occur. The rank-order method has raters ranking subordinates from &quot;best&quot; to &quot;worst&quot;, but how truly good or bad one is on a performance dimension would be unknown. The paired-comparison method requires the rater to select the two &quot;best&quot; subordinates out of a group on each dimension then rank individuals according to the number of times each subordinate was selected as one of the &quot;best&quot;. The forced-distribution method is good for large groups of ratees. The raters evaluate each subordinate on one or more dimensions and then place (or &quot;force-fit&quot;) each subordinate in a 5 to 7 category normal distribution. The method of top-grading can be applied to the forced distribution method. This method identifies the 10% lowest performing subordinates, as according to the forced distribution, and dismisses them leaving the 90% higher performing subordinates.
*Behavioral checklists and scales: behaviors are more definite than traits. The critical incidents method (or critical incident technique) concerns &quot;specific behaviors indicative of good or bad job performance&quot;. Supervisors record behaviors of what they judge to be job performance relevant, and they keep a running tally of good and bad behaviors. A discussion on performance may then follow. The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) combine the critical incidents method with rating scale methods by rating performance on a scale but with the scale points being anchored by behavioral incidents. Note that BARS are job specific. In the behavioral observation scale (BOS) approach to performance appraisal, employees are also evaluated in the terms of critical incidents. In that respect, it is similar to BARS. However, the BOS appraisal rate subordinates on the &quot;frequency&quot; of the critical incidents as they are observed to occur over a given period. The ratings are assigned on a five-point scale. The behavioral incidents for the rating scale are developed in the same way as for BARS through identification by supervisors or other subject matter experts. Similarly, BOS techniques meet equal employment opportunity because they are related to actual behavior required for successful job performance.

The frequency of an evaluation, and policies concerning them, varies widely from workplace to workplace. Sometimes, an evaluation will be given to a new employee after a probationary period lapses, after which they may be conducted on a regular basis (such as every year). According to the 2014 Performance Management survey, 96% of employers perform annual performance evaluations and 44% of employers perform a 90-day performance review for new employees.

=== Peer and self assessments ===

For assessment to be successful and effective it must be conducted as a managed process. The process must be given sufficient time and space and be supported by appropriately trained and purposed personnel. Key activities to support the appraisal process are identified as:

* A suitable model of assessment (for example: narrative self-assessment, goal-based assessment, SWOT analysis or rating scales)
* appropriately credentialed staff to manage the process
* A supported approach to the assessment (employees understand the process, are given time to engage with it and are motivated to)
* Improvement actions are identified and acknowledged where achieved, further planning is undertaken where new or unresolved improvement actions are identified.
* The improvement cycle has a ‘closed loop’ structure, allowing employees to reset prior to progressing to new goals.
* Employees can see how their development relates to the wider organisational plan. 
While performance appraisal is typically performed along reporting relationships (usually top-down), assessment can include both peer and self-assessment.

====Self Assessment====
Self-assessment incorporates a &quot;“wide variety of mechanisms and techniques through which students describe (i.e., assess) and possibly assign merit or worth to (i.e., evaluate) the qualities of their own learning processes and products”&quot; (p. 804)

Threats to successful implementation of self-assessment are scarcity of time, overemphasis on scoring tools, failure to follow-up improvement actions and lack of communication. It is a Self-reflective process meaning that structure, and the ability to remain objective about one’s own achievements and qualities are essential to the success of self-assessment.

The risk of flawed self-assessment is that self-perceptions of behaviours, knowledge and skill can fail to align with the reality of an individual’s performance. This can either absorb excessive management time in addressing flawed self-perceptions of performance or, if the behaviour is not addressed, can detract from the achievement of organisational goals. Therefore, evolved reflective skills are essential to successful self-assessment.

====Peer assessments====
In peer assessment the appraisee is subject to feedback from peers – that is members of an organisation who function at the same level as the appraisee. In general, tools are made available to peer assessors to grade the appraisee against pre-determined criteria. These tools typically take the form of a multi-format questionnaire that might include VAS, Likert scoring and the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data by a number of means.

As in any method of performance appraisal, high quality of feedback is a key to the effectiveness of peer evaluation, as is closing the loop on the appraisal process. There are threats to both the quality and perception of feedback in peer-assessment, for example peers may be biased by pre-existing relationships and less trust or value might be put in the appraisal of a peer than a senior. Additionally in an organization where peer assessment is undertaken, employees may have concern for how the analysis of other is perceived, and how this my impact on their own assessment in turn.

Potential benefits of peer assessment are:

* Decreased “social loafing” (mitigates the tendency to be less productive when part of a team).
* Improved performance.
* An environment that better reflects the culture of the team.
* Individuals take greater of each other and their relationships.

====360 Degree Feedback====
360 degree feedback contains elements of self, peer and manager appraisal as it aims to incorporate feedback from multiple sources to produce a more comprehensive evaluation of the appraisee. The feedback is divided to reflect formative and summative domains – formative feedback is taken from peers; Summative feedback is taken from managers. Both are combined to inform development, but it is the summative feedback which counts most toward organizational performance indicators and potential rewards or punishments related to performance.

The principal advantage of 360 degree feedback is that it is comprehensive and makes it possible for the “organization” to feed back on an individual, thus blunting potential biases that might occur in less fulsome processes, as such the 360 process promotes organizational trust, and mitigates against staff members’ intent to leave.

====Negotiated Performance Appraisal====
In negotiated performance appraisal the appraisal follows the typical format, but a facilitator is present who may mediate perceived risks of defensiveness, bias or conflict and can prevent the tendency of appraisers to leave areas of under-performance unaddressed. This approach has little presence in the literature around performance appraisal but may be of benefit in supporting face to face peer performance conversations.

In general, optimal PA process involves a combination of multiple assessment modalities. One common recommendation is that assessment flows from self-assessment, to peer-assessment, to management assessment – in that order. Starting with self-assessment facilitates avoidance of conflict. Peer feedback ensures peer accountability, which may yield better results than accountability to management. Management assessment comes last for need of recognition by authority and avoidance of conflict in case of disagreements. It is generally recommended that PA is done in shorter cycles to avoid high-stakes discussions, as is usually the case in long-cycle appraisals.

Research has shown that the source of the feedback (either manager or peer) does not matter in influencing employees&#x27; subsequent innovative or extra-role behaviors after the feedback is received. As long as the feedback is provided, the source does not matter.

==Principal–agent framework==
The principal–agent framework is a model describing the relationship of information held between an employer and an employee. It is used to forecast responses from employees and strategies at finding resolutions against misaligned incentives that interfere with the goals of the employer. The model makes two assumptions: the principals wants agents to work for the principal&#x27;s best interest, but agents possess different goals than the principals; and, the agents have more information than the principals resulting in the asymmetry of information between the two parties. This paradigm creates adverse selections and moral hazards for the hiring company in deciding how to effectively minimize the potential threat of shirking; disruption to daily operations; and loss in output margins due to actions of the employee.

===Incentive conflict resolutions===
Incentive pay leads to the increase of agents awareness of their own actions and seek to maximize their pay by considering the best possible actions that can be taken for the success of the firm and actively explore several options to minimize opportunity costs. The issue with this form of resolution is the firm must compensate the agents for bearing a risk premium and inequitable pay.

Fixed payment ensures a safer, standardized mode of contract that delivers reassurance in spite of performance fluctuations and external environment volatility. However, lack of motivation occurs more readily and incurs shirking and adverse selections.

==Organizational citizenship behavior==

Also referred to as contextual behavior, prosocial behavior, and extra-role behavior, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) consists of employee behavior that contributes to the welfare of the organization but is beyond the scope of the employee&#x27;s job duties. These extra-role behaviors may help or hinder the attainment of organizational goals. Research supports five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, courtesy, sportsmanship, and civic virtue. Researchers have found that the OCB dimensions of altruism and civic virtue can have just as much of an impact on manager&#x27;s subjective evaluations of employees&#x27; performances as employees&#x27; objective productivity levels. The degree to which OCB can influence judgments of job performance is relatively high. Controversy exists as to whether OCB should be formally considered as a part of performance appraisal (PA).

==Interviews==

The performance appraisal (PA) interview is typically the final step of the appraisal process. The interview is held between the subordinate and supervisor. The PA interview can be considered of great significance to an organization&#x27;s PA system. It is most advantageous when both the superior and subordinate participate in the interview discussion and establish goals together. Three factors consistently contribute to effective PA interviews: the supervisor&#x27;s knowledge of the subordinate&#x27;s job and performance in it, the supervisor&#x27;s support of the subordinate, and a welcoming of the subordinate&#x27;s participation.
The objective of performance appraisal is to assess the training development needs of employees.

==Employee reactions==

Numerous researchers have reported that many employees are not satisfied with their performance appraisal (PA) systems. Studies have shown that subjectivity as well as appraiser bias is often a problem perceived by as many as half of employees. Appraiser bias, however, appears to be perceived as more of a problem in government and public sector organizations. Also, according to some studies, employees wished to see changes in the PA system by making &quot;the system more objective, improving the feedback process, and increasing the frequency of review.&quot; In light of traditional PA operation defects, &quot;organizations are now increasingly incorporating practices that may improve the system. These changes are particularly concerned with areas such as elimination of subjectivity and bias, training of appraisers, improvement of the feedback process and the performance review discussion.&quot; 
According to a meta-analysis of 27 field studies, general employee participation in his/her own appraisal process was positively correlated with employee reactions to the PA system. More specifically, employee participation in the appraisal process was most strongly related to employee satisfaction with the PA system. Concerning the reliability of employee reaction measures, researchers have found employee reaction scales to be sound with few concerns through using a confirmatory factor analysis that is representative of employee reaction scales.

Researchers suggest that the study of employees&#x27; reactions to PA is important because of two main reasons: employee reactions symbolizes a criterion of interest to practitioners of PAs and employee reactions have been associated through theory to determinants of appraisal acceptance and success. Researchers translate these reasons into the context of the scientist-practitioner gap or the &quot;lack of alignment between research and practice.&quot;

Schultz and Schultz notes that opposition to performance appraisals generally do not receive positive ratings from anyone involved, &quot;so employees that will be directly affected by the Performance Appraisals are less than enthusiastic about participating in them&quot;. When an employee knows that their work performance has been less than perfect it is nerve-racking to be evaluated. Employees tend to be hostile knowing they could be given bad news on their performance.

Most managers prefer to begin with positive information and then add bad news or suggestions for improvement at the end. However, employees are most satisfied when bad news is addressed early in the interview and positive information is saved until the end, so that the meeting ends with a positive feeling.

===Hidden cost of control===
While performance appraisals are fundamental in the assessment of employees, frequent testing can result in the deterioration of employee performance, thus impacting overall business operations. The agent&#x27;s perception of these &#x27;control&#x27; devices are that they signal mistrust to the individual and reduce working autonomy. If these management practices are employed without consideration of the emotional response to said devices, then the agent&#x27;s willingness to engage in the company&#x27;s ambitions are greatly reduced as suggested in empirical studies.

==Legal implications==

There are federal laws addressing fair employment practices, and this also concerns performance appraisal (PA). Discrimination can occur within predictions of performance and evaluations of job behaviors. The revision of many court cases has revealed the involvement of alleged discrimination which was often linked to the assessment of the employee&#x27;s job performance. Some of the laws which protect individuals against discrimination are &quot;the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).&quot; Lawsuits may also results from charges of an employer&#x27;s negligence, defamation, or misrepresentation. A few appraisal criteria to keep in mind for a legally sound PA is to keep the content of the appraisal objective, job-related, behavior-based, within the control of the ratee, and related to specific functions rather than a global assessment. Some appraisal procedure suggestions for a legally sound PA is to standardize operations, communicate formally with employees, provide information of performance deficits and give opportunities to employees to correct those deficits, give employees access to appraisal results, provide written instructions for the training of raters, and use multiple, diverse and unbiased raters. These are valuable but not exhaustive lists of recommendations for PAs.

The Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines apply to any selection procedure that is used for making employment decisions, not only for hiring, but also for promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, discharge, or early retirement. Therefore, employment appraisal procedures must be validated like tests or any other selection device. Employers who base their personnel decisions on the results of a well-designed performance review program that includes formal appraisal interviews are much more likely to be successful in defending themselves against claims of discrimination.

==Cross-cultural implications==

Performance appraisal (PA) systems, and the premises of which they were based, that have been formed and regarded as effective in the United States may not have the transferability for effectual utilization in other countries or cultures, and vice versa. Performance &quot;appraisal is thought to be deeply rooted in the norms, values, and beliefs of a society&quot;. &quot;Appraisal reflects attitudes towards motivation and performance (self) and relationships (e.g. peers, subordinates, supervisors, organization), all of which vary from one country to the next&quot;. Therefore, appraisal should be in conjunction with cultural norms, values, and beliefs in order to be operative. The deep-seated norms, values and beliefs in different cultures affect employee motivation and perception of organizational equity and justice. In effect, a PA system created and considered effectual in one country may not be an appropriate assessment in another cultural region.

For example, some countries and cultures value the trait of assertiveness and personal accomplishment while others instead place more merit on cooperation and interpersonal connection. Countries scoring high on assertiveness consider PA to be a way of assuring equity among employees so that higher performing employees receive greater rewards or higher salaries. Countries scoring low on assertiveness but higher in interpersonal relations may not like the social separation and pay inequity of higher/lower performing employees; employees from this more cooperative rather than individualistic culture place more concern on interpersonal relationships with other employees rather than on individual interests. High assertive countries value performance feedback for self-management and effectiveness purposes while countries low in assertiveness view performance feedback as &quot;threatening and obtrusive&quot;. In this case, the PA of the high assertive countries would likely not be beneficial for countries scoring lower in assertiveness to employ. However, countries scoring lower in assertiveness could employ PA for purposes of improving long-term communication development within the organization such as clarifying job objectives, guide training and development plans, and lessen the gap between job performance and organizational expectations.

==Developments in information technology==

Computers have been playing an increasing role in PA for some time. There are two main aspects to this. The first is in relation to the electronic monitoring of performance, which affords the ability to record a huge amount of data on multiple dimensions of work performance. Not only does it facilitate a more continuous and detailed collection of performance data in some jobs, e.g. call centres, but it has the capacity to do so in a non-obvious, covert manner. The second aspect is in mediating the feedback process, by recording and aggregating performance ratings and written observations and making the information available on-line; many software packages are available for this. The use of IT in these ways undoubtedly helps in making the appraisal process more manageable, especially where multiple rating sources are involved, but it also raises many questions about appraisees&#x27; reactions and possible effects on PA outcomes. Mostly, the evidence so far is positive.

==Rater errors==

Mistakes made by raters is a major source of problems in performance appraisal. There is no simple way to eliminate these errors, but making raters aware of them through training is helpful. Rater errors are based on the feelings and it has consequences at the time of appraisal.

Varying standards
:*Problem: When a manager appraises (evaluates) his or her employees and the manager uses different standards and expectations for employees who are performing similar jobs.
:*Example: A professor does not grade the exams of all students in the same standards, sometimes it depends on the affection that the professor has towards others. This affection will make professor give students higher or lower grades.
:*Solution: The rater must use the same standards and weights for every employee. The manager should be able to show coherent arguments in order to explain the difference. Therefore, it would be easier to know if it is done, because the employee has provided a good performance, or if it because the manager perception is distorted.

Recency effects
:*Problem: When the manager rates an individual above what the performance actually merits due to only considering the very latest performance and not taking into consideration a sufficient period for quality assessment.
:*Example: When a professor gives the course grade based just in the performance of the student only in the last week.
:*Solution: In order to avoid that, the manager can employ methods that track dominant traits as well as minor traits to understand adaptation over time. Total strength can be understood as the sum of the relative strengths.

Primacy effects 
:*Problem: When the person who evaluates gives more weight according to information the manager has received first.
:*Example: During an evaluation the manager gives a higher score due to the initial impressions the employee made during their first few weeks, and is overlooking recent performance issues. 
:*Solution: When the manager has to make a decision, it is better not to do it according to what he or she remembers, but should be based on all the relevant and documented data of the employees performance.
Central tendency
:*Problem: When the manager evaluates every employee within a narrow range, as the average because he or she is dismissing the differences in the performance that employees have done.
:*Example: When a professor because the average of the class tends to grade harder. Therefore, if the performance of the class average is quite high, the professor will evaluate them more highly. On the contrary, if the average of the class is lower, he or she would appraise lower.
Leniency
:*Problem: Rating of all employees are at the high end of the scale.
:*Example: When the professor tends to grade harder, because the average of the class.
Strictness
:*Problem: When a manager uses only the lower part of the scale to rate employees.
:*Example: When the professor tends to grade lower, because the average of the class.
:*Solution: try to focus more on the individual performance of every employee regardless the average results.
Rater bias
:*Problem: Rater&#x27;s when the manager rates according to their values and prejudices which at the same time distort the rating. Those differentiations can be made due to the ethnic group, gender, age, religion, sexuality or appearance of the employee.
:*Example: Sometimes happen that a manager treats someone different, because they think that the employee is homosexual.
:*Solution: If then, the examination is done by higher-level managers, this kind of appraising can be corrected, because they are supposed to be more impartial. 
Halo effect 
:*Problem: When a manager rates an employee high on all items because of one characteristic they like.
:*Example: If a worker has few absences but the supervisor has a good relationship with that employee, the supervisor might give to the employee a high rating in all other areas of work, in order to balance the rating. Sometimes it happens due to the emotional dependability based on the good relationship they have.
:*Solution: Training raters to recognize the problem and differentiating the person with the performance they do. 
Horn effect 
:*Problem: This is the opposite to the halo effect and horns effect occurs when a manager rates an employee low on all items because of one characteristic that he or she dislikes.
:*Example: If a worker performs well but at certain times loves telling jokes, but the supervisor dislikes jokes, the supervisor might give the employee a lower rating in all other areas of work. Sometimes it happens when they do not have a close relationship and manager does not like the employee.
:*Solution: Is the same as in the halo effect. Training raters to recognize the problem and differentiating the person with the performance they provide.
Contrast 
:*Problem: The tendency to rate people relative to other people rather than to the individual performance. 
:*Example: At school, if you are sat down where all the chatty people are and you are silent but you do not pay attention and you do not do your homework, because you are drawing; when teacher gets angry with the group, you might be excluded of the bad behavior they have just because you are silent; but not because you are doing a good performance. Therefore, according to the group, you are not that chatty, but you are either doing the proper performance. However the rater will only get the idea that your behavior is not as bad as other, thus, you will be rate higher.
:*Solution: The rating should reflect the task requirement performance, not according to other people attitude.
Similar-to-me / Different-from-me
:*Problem: Sometimes, raters are influenced by some of the characteristics that people show. Depending if those characteristics are similar or different to the evaluators, they would be evaluated differently. 
:*Example: A manager with higher education degree might give subordinates with higher education degree a higher appraisal than those with only bachelor&#x27;s degrees.
:*Solution: Try to focus on the performance the employee is doing regardless the common characteristic that you have
Sampling
:*Problem: When the rater evaluates the performance of an employee relying only on a small percentage of the amount of work done. 
:*Example: An employee has to do 100 reports. Then, the manager takes five of them to check how has the work been done, and the manager finds mistakes in those five reports. Therefore the manager will appraise the work of the employee as a &quot;poor&quot; one, without having into account the other 95 reports that the manager has not seen, that have been made correctly. 
:*Solution: To follow the entire track of the performance, not just a little part of it.
It is difficult to minimize rater errors, since humans are not objective. Moreover, sometimes, managers are not aware of having preferences towards people, but there are tools to have more objective information, such as using available technology to track performances and record it.

Consultant Marcus Buckingham and executive Ashley Goodall, reporting on a large-scale Deloitte performance management survey on &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, said, contrary to the assumptions underlying performance rating, the rating mainly measured the unique rating tendencies of the rater and thus reveals more about the rater than about the person who is rated. They referred to this as the &quot;idiosyncratic rater effect&quot;. In view of this effect, they advocate a radically different approach to performance management. In their scenario, 360-degree feedback and similar time-intensive exercises are replaced by team leaders&#x27; &quot;performance snapshots&quot; that focus on what they would &quot;do&quot; with each team member rather than what they &quot;think&quot; of that individual, and yearly appraisals of past performance are replaced by weekly check-ins among team leader and team member, preferably initiated by the team member, that focus on current and upcoming work.

<doc id="228073" wikidata="Q2413064" url="?curid=228073" title="Henry Heerup">
<text>Henry Heerup (4 November 1907 – 30 May 1993) was a Danish painter, graphic artist and sculptor. Heerup was an extremely versatile artist. His works of art included paintings, lithographs, stone sculptures, linoleum cuts and drawings as well as objects which he composed from scrap.

==Biography==

Henry Heerup was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark. Heerup was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1926 and graduated in 1932. He studied painting under Axel Jørgensen and Einar Nielsen at the Royal Danish Academy of Art. He also studied sculpture under Einar Utzon-Frank. He painted &quot;The Old Oak in Wolfvalley&quot; (1924) whichj was his first oil painting.

During the 1930s he developed his trash sculptures. During the 1940s he became a member of Corner and Høst and exhibited with them. In 1949 he joined COBRA and participated in some of their exhibitions. He developed an international reputation exhibiting across Europe and North America. From 1946 until his death in 1993, he maintained a studio and gallery on Kamstrupvej in Rødovre. Large parts of his art were created in the open in his garden.

Heerup was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1968. He was also awarded the Eckersberg Medal and the Thorvaldsen Medal, and received the Storm, P. Grant, and NL Stevns Grants.Louisiana Museum of Modern Art arranged a major retrospective in celebration of Heerup&#x27;s art at the time of his sixtieth birthday in 1967. The film &quot;Et år med Henry&quot; (Jørgen Roos Film. 1967) by writer and director Jens Jørgen Thorsen focused on Henry Heerup&#x27;s garden and studio in Rødovre.

On his death in 1993, Henry Heerup was interred in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen.

==Heerup Museum==
In 1958, Heerup married conservator and painter Marion Brock.
After Heerup&#x27;s death, his widow donated their estate to Rødovre Municipality in 1995. Heerup Museum was designed by the architect Bernd Kjelland as an extension to the old farm Rødovregaard in Rødovre. The mainstay of the museum is a donation of Heerup&#x27;s works. The museum opened on May 1, 2000.

<text>The Battle of France (; 10 May – 25 June 1940), also known as the Western Campaign (German: &quot;Westfeldzug&quot;), the French Campaign (, ) and the Fall of France, during the Second World War was the German invasion of the Low Countries (Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) and France. The invasion plan for the Low Countries and France was called Fall Gelb (). Fall Rot () was planned to finish off the French and British after the evacuation at Dunkirk. The Low Countries and France were defeated and occupied by Axis troops down to the Demarcation line. In November 1942, Wehrmacht troops also occupied Vichy France ending land operations on the Western Front until the Normandy landings began on 6 June 1944.

On 3 September 1939, France and Britain declared war on Nazi Germany, over the German invasion of Poland on 1 September. In early September 1939, France began the limited Saar Offensive but by mid-October had withdrawn to their start lines. Starting 10 May 1940, Wehrmacht armies invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and parts of France.

In &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; (&quot;Case Yellow&quot;), German armoured units made a surprise push through the Ardennes and then along the Somme valley, cutting off and surrounding the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium to meet the German armies there. British, Belgian and French forces were pushed back to the sea by the Germans where the British and French navies evacuated the encircled elements of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and the French and Belgian armies from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo.

German forces began (&quot;Case Red&quot;) on 5 June 1940. The remaining Allied divisions in France, sixty French and two British, made a determined stand on the Somme and Aisne rivers but were defeated by the German combination of air superiority and armoured mobility. Italy entered the war on the German side on 10 June 1940 and began the Italian invasion of France. German armies outflanked the Maginot Line and pushed deep into France, occupying Paris unopposed on 14 June. After the flight of the French government and the collapse of the French Army, German commanders met with French officials on 18 June to negotiate an end to hostilities.

On 22 June 1940, the Second Armistice at Compiègne was signed by France and Germany. The neutral Vichy government led by Marshal Philippe Pétain replaced the Third Republic and German military occupation began along the French North Sea and Atlantic coasts and their hinterlands. The Italian invasion of France over the Alps took a small amount of ground and after the armistice, Italy occupied a small area in the south-east. The Vichy regime retained the (free zone) in the south. Following the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942, in Case Anton, the Germans and Italians took control of the zone until France was liberated by the Allies in 1944.
==Background==

===Maginot Line===


During the 1930s, the French built the Maginot Line, fortifications along the border with Germany. The line was intended to economise on manpower and deter a German invasion across the FrancoGerman border by diverting it into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the French Army. The war would take place outside French territory, avoiding the destruction of the First World War. The main section of the Maginot Line ran from the Swiss border and ended at Longwy; the hills and woods of the Ardennes region were thought to cover the area to the north. General Philippe Pétain declared the Ardennes to be &quot;impenetrable&quot; as long as &quot;special provisions&quot; were taken to destroy an invasion force as it emerged from the Ardennes by a pincer attack. The French commander-in-chief, Maurice Gamelin, also believed the area to be safe from attack, noting it &quot;never favoured large operations&quot;. French war games, held in 1938, of a hypothetical German armoured attack through the Ardennes, left the army with the impression that the region was still largely impenetrable and that this, along with the obstacle of the Meuse River, would allow the French time to bring up troops into the area to counter any attack.

===German invasion of Poland===
In 1939, the United Kingdom and France offered military support to Poland in the likely case of a German invasion. At dawn on 1 September 1939, the German invasion of Poland began. France and the United Kingdom declared war on 3 September, after an ultimatum for German forces immediately to withdraw their forces from Poland was not answered. Australia and New Zealand also declared war on 3 September, South Africa on 6 September and Canada on 10 September. While British and French commitments to Poland were met politically, the Allies failed to fulfil their military obligations to Poland, later called the Western betrayal by the Poles. The possibility of Soviet assistance to Poland had ended with the Munich Agreement of 1938, after which the Soviet Union and Germany eventually negotiated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which included an agreement to partition Poland. The Allies settled on a long-war strategy in which they would complete the rearmament plans of the 1930s while fighting a defensive land war against Germany and weakening its war economy with a trade blockade, ready for an eventual invasion of Germany.

===Phoney War===


On 7 September, in accordance with the Franco-Polish alliance, France began the Saar Offensive with an advance from the Maginot Line into the Saar. France had mobilised 98 divisions (all but 28 of them reserve or fortress formations) and 2,500 tanks against a German force consisting of 43 divisions (32 of them reserves) and no tanks. The French advanced until they met the thin and undermanned Siegfried Line. On 17 September, Gamelin gave the order to withdraw French troops to their starting positions; the last of them left Germany on 17 September, the day of the Soviet invasion of Poland. Following the Saar Offensive, a period of inaction called the Phoney War (the French , joke war or the German , sitting war) set in between the belligerents. Adolf Hitler had hoped that France and Britain would acquiesce in the conquest of Poland and quickly make peace. On 6 October, in a speech to the Reichstag he made a peace offer to the Western powers.

==German strategy==

=== (Case Yellow)===

On 9 October 1939, Hitler issued 6 (). Hitler recognised the necessity of military campaigns to defeat the Western European nations, preliminary to the conquest of territory in Eastern Europe, to avoid a two-front war but these intentions were absent from Directive N°6. The plan was based on the seemingly more realistic assumption that German military strength would have to be built up for several years. Only limited objectives could be envisaged and were aimed at improving Germany&#x27;s ability to survive a long war in the west. Hitler ordered a conquest of the Low Countries to be executed at the shortest possible notice to forestall the French and prevent Allied air power from threatening the industrial area of the Ruhr. It would also provide the basis for a long-term air and sea campaign against Britain. There was no mention in the directive of a consecutive attack to conquer the whole of France, although the directive read that as much as possible of the border areas in northern France should be occupied.

On 10 October 1939, Britain refused Hitler&#x27;s offer of peace and on 12 October, France did the same. The pre-war German codename of plans for a campaign in the Low Countries was (Deployment Instruction No. 1, Case Yellow). Colonel-General Franz Halder (Chief of the General Staff [OKH]), presented the first plan for on 19 October. entailed an advance through the middle of Belgium; envisioned a frontal attack, at a cost of half million German soldiers to attain the limited goal of throwing the Allies back to the River Somme. German strength in 1940 would then be spent and only in 1942 could the main attack against France begin. When Hitler raised objections to the plan and wanted an armoured breakthrough, as had happened in the invasion of Poland, Halder and Brauchitsch attempted to dissuade him, arguing that while the fast-moving mechanised tactics were effective against a &quot;shoddy&quot; Eastern European army, they would not work against a first-rate military like the French.

Hitler was disappointed with Halder&#x27;s plan and initially reacted by deciding that the Army should attack early, ready or not, hoping that Allied unreadiness might bring about an easy victory. Hitler proposed an invasion on 25 October 1939 but accepted that the date was probably unrealistic. On 29 October, Halder presented , with a secondary attack on the Netherlands. On 5 November, Hitler informed Walther von Brauchitsch that he intended the invasion to begin on 12 November. Brauchitsch replied that the military had yet to recover from the Polish campaign and offered to resign; this was refused but two days later Hitler postponed the attack, giving poor weather as the reason for the delay. More postponements followed, as commanders persuaded Hitler to delay the attack for a few days or weeks, to remedy some defect in the preparations or to wait for better weather. Hitler also tried to alter the plan, which he found unsatisfactory; his weak understanding of how poorly prepared Germany was for war and how it would cope with losses of armoured vehicles were not fully considered. Though Poland had been quickly defeated, many armoured vehicles had been lost and were hard to replace. This led to the German effort becoming dispersed; the main attack would remain in central Belgium, secondary attacks would be undertaken on the flanks. Hitler made such a suggestion on 11 November, pressing for an early attack on unprepared targets.

Halder&#x27;s plan satisfied no-one; General Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group A () recognised that it did not adhere to the classic principles of (war of manoeuvre) that had guided German strategy since the 19th century. A breakthrough was needed to encircle and destroy the main body of Allied forces. The most practical place to achieve this would be in the region of Sedan, which lay in the sector of Army Group A. On 21 October, Rundstedt agreed with his chief of staff, Erich von Manstein, that an alternative operational plan to reflect these principles was needed, by making Army Group A as strong as possible at the expense of Army Group B to the north.

===Manstein plan===


While Manstein was formulating new plans in Koblenz, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Heinz Guderian, commander of the XIX Army Corps, was lodged in a nearby hotel. Manstein was initially considering a move north from Sedan, directly in the rear of the main Allied mobile forces in Belgium. When Guderian was invited to contribute to the plan during informal discussions, he proposed that most of the &quot;Panzerwaffe&quot; should be concentrated at Sedan. This concentration of armour would advance to the west to the English Channel, without waiting for the main body of infantry divisions. This might lead to a strategic collapse of the enemy, avoiding the relatively high number of casualties normally caused by a &quot;Kesselschlacht&quot; (cauldron battle).

Such a risky independent use of armour had been widely discussed in Germany before the war but OKH doubted such an operation could work. Manstein&#x27;s general operational ideas won immediate support from Guderian, who understood the terrain, having experienced the conditions with the German Army in 1914 and 1918. Manstein wrote his first memorandum outlining the alternative plan on 31 October. In it he avoided mentioning Guderian and played down the strategic part of the armoured units, to avoid unnecessary resistance. Six more memoranda followed between 31 October 1939 and 12 January 1940, each becoming more radical. All were rejected by &quot;OKH&quot; and nothing of their content reached Hitler.

===Mechelen incident===

On 10 January 1940, a German aircraft, carrying a staff officer with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; plans for an offensive through central Belgium to the North Sea, force-landed near Maasmechelen (Mechelen) in Belgium. The documents were captured but Allied intelligence doubted that they were genuine. In the full moon period in April 1940, another Allied alert was called for a possible attack on the Low Countries or Holland, an offensive through the Low Countries to outflank the Maginot Line from the north, an attack on the Maginot Line or an invasion through Switzerland. None of the contingencies anticipated the German attack through the Ardennes but after the loss of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; plans, the Germans assumed that the Allied appreciation of German intentions would have been reinforced. &quot;Aufmarschanweisung&quot; N°3, &quot;Fall Gelb&quot;, an amendment to the plan on 30 January, was only a revision of details. On 24 February, the main German effort was moved south to the Ardennes. Twenty divisions (including seven panzer and three motorised divisions) were transferred from &quot;Heeresgruppe B&quot; opposite Holland and Belgium to &quot;Heeresgruppe A&quot; facing the Ardennes. French military intelligence uncovered a transfer of German divisions from the Saar to the north of the Moselle but failed to detect the redeployment from the Dutch frontier to the Eifel–Moselle area.

====Adoption of the Manstein plan====

On 27 January, Manstein was sacked as Chief of Staff of Army Group A and appointed commander of an army corps in East Prussia. To silence Manstein, Halder had instigated his transfer to Stettin on 9 February. Manstein&#x27;s staff brought his case to Hitler, who had independently suggested an attack at Sedan, against the advice of OKH. On 2 February, Hitler was told of Manstein&#x27;s plan and on 17 February, Hitler summoned Manstein, General Rudolf Schmundt (Chief of Personnel of the German Army) and General Alfred Jodl, the Chief of Operations of (OKW, Supreme Command of the Armed Forces), to a conference. The next day, Hitler ordered Manstein&#x27;s thinking to be adopted, because it offered the possibility of decisive victory. Hitler recognised the breakthrough at Sedan only in tactical terms, whereas Manstein saw it as a means to an end. He envisaged an operation to the English Channel and the encirclement of the Allied armies in Belgium; if the plan succeeded, it could have a strategic effect.

Halder then went through an &quot;astonishing change of opinion&quot;, accepting that the should be at Sedan. He had no intention of allowing an independent strategic penetration by the seven &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions of Army Group A. Much to the dismay of Guderian, this element was absent from the new plan, , issued on 24 February. The bulk of the German officer corps was appalled and called Halder the &quot;gravedigger of the &quot;Panzer&quot; force&quot;. Even when adapted to more conventional methods, the new plan provoked a storm of protest from the majority of German generals. They thought it utterly irresponsible to create a concentration of forces in a position impossible to adequately resupply, along routes that could be cut easily by the French. If the Allies did not react as expected, the German offensive could end in catastrophe. Their objections were ignored and Halder argued that, as Germany&#x27;s strategic position seemed hopeless anyway, even the slightest chance of decisive victory should be grasped. Shortly before the invasion, Hitler, who had spoken to forces on the Western Front and who was encouraged by the success in Norway, confidently predicted the campaign would take only six weeks. He was most excited over the planned military glider attack on Fort Eben-Emael.

==Allied strategy==

===Escaut plan/Plan E===


On 3 September 1939, French military strategy had been settled, taking in analyses of geography, resources and manpower. The French Army would defend in the east (right flank) and attack on the west (left flank) by advancing into Belgium, to fight forward of the French frontier. The extent of the forward move was dependent on events, which were complicated when Belgium ended the Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920 after the German Remilitarisation of the Rhineland on 7 March 1936. The neutrality of the Belgian state was reluctant openly to co-operate with France but information was communicated about Belgian defences. By May 1940, there had been an exchange of the general nature of French and Belgian defence plans but little co-ordination against a German offensive to the west, through Luxembourg and eastern Belgium. The French expected Germany to breach Belgian neutrality first, providing a pretext for French intervention or that the Belgians would request support when an invasion was imminent. Most of the French mobile forces were assembled along the Belgian border, ready to forestall the Germans.

A prompt appeal for help from the Belgians might give the French time to reach the German–Belgian frontier but if not, there were three feasible defensive lines further back. A practicable line existed from Givet to Namur, across the Gembloux Gap (), Wavre, Louvain and along the Dyle river to Antwerp, which was shorter than the alternatives. A second possibility was a line from the French border to Condé, Tournai, along the Escaut (Scheldt) to Ghent and thence to Zeebrugge on the North Sea coast, possibly further along the Scheldt (Escaut) to Antwerp, which became the Escaut plan/Plan E. The third possibility was along field defences of the French border from Luxembourg to Dunkirk. For the first fortnight of the war, Gamelin favoured Plan E, because of the example of the fast German advances in Poland. Gamelin and the other French commanders doubted that they could move any further forward before the Germans arrived. In late September, Gamelin issued a directive to &quot;Général d&#x27;armée&quot; Gaston Billotte, commander of the 1st Army Group,

giving the 1st Army Group permission to enter Belgium, to deploy along the Escaut according to Plan E. On 24 October, Gamelin directed that an advance beyond the Escaut was only feasible if the French moved fast enough to forestall the Germans.

===Dyle plan/Plan D===

By late 1939, the Belgians had improved their defences along the Albert Canal and increased the readiness of the army; Gamelin and (GQG) began to consider the possibility of advancing further than the Escaut. By November, GQG had decided that a defence along the Dyle Line was feasible, despite the doubts of General Alphonse Georges, commander of the North-Eastern Front, about reaching the Dyle before the Germans. The British had been lukewarm about an advance into Belgium, but Gamelin persuaded them; on 9 November, the Dyle plan was adopted. On 17 November, a session of the Supreme War Council deemed it essential to occupy the Dyle Line and Gamelin issued a directive that day detailing a line from Givet to Namur, the Gembloux Gap, Wavre, Louvain and Antwerp. For the next four months, the Dutch and Belgian armies laboured over their defences, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) expanded and the French army received more equipment and training. Gamelin also considered a move towards Breda in the Netherlands; if the Allies prevented a German occupation of Holland, the ten divisions of the Dutch army would join the Allied armies, control of the North Sea would be enhanced and the Germans would be denied bases for attacks on Britain.

By May 1940, the 1st Army Group was responsible for the defence of France from the Channel coast south to the Maginot Line. The Seventh Army ( Henri Giraud), BEF (General Lord Gort), First Army ( Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard) and Ninth Army ( André Corap) were ready to advance to the Dyle Line, by pivoting on the right (southern) Second Army. The Seventh Army would take over west of Antwerp, ready to move into Holland and the Belgians were expected to delay a German advance, then retire from the Albert Canal to the Dyle, from Antwerp to Louvain. On the Belgian right, the BEF was to defend about of the Dyle from Louvain to Wavre with nine divisions and the First Army, on the right of the BEF, was to hold with ten divisions from Wavre across the Gembloux Gap to Namur. The gap from the Dyle to Namur north of the Sambre, with Maastricht and Mons on either side, had few natural obstacles and was a traditional route of invasion, leading straight to Paris. The Ninth Army would take post south of Namur, along the Meuse to the left (northern) flank of the Second Army.

The Second Army was the right (eastern) flank army of the 1st Army Group, holding the line from Pont à Bar west of Sedan to Longuyon. GQG considered that the Second and Ninth armies had the easiest task of the army group, dug in on the west bank of the Meuse on ground that was easily defended and behind the Ardennes, a considerable obstacle, the traversing of which would give plenty of warning of a German attack in the centre of the French front. After the transfer from the strategic reserve of the Seventh Army to the 1st Army Group, seven divisions remained behind the Second and Ninth armies and more could be moved from behind the Maginot Line. All but one division were either side of the junction of the two armies, GQG being more concerned about a possible German attack past the north end of the Maginot Line and then south-east through the Stenay Gap, for which the divisions behind the Second Army were well placed.

====Breda variant====

If the Allies could control the Scheldt Estuary, supplies could be transported to Antwerp by ship and contact established with the Dutch Army along the river. On 8 November, Gamelin directed that a German invasion of the Netherlands must not be allowed to progress around the west of Antwerp and gain the south bank of the Scheldt. The left flank of the 1st Army Group was reinforced by the Seventh Army, containing some of the best and most mobile French divisions, which moved from the general reserve by December. The role of the army was to occupy the south bank of the Scheldt and be ready to move into Holland and protect the estuary by holding the north bank along the Beveland Peninsula (now the Walcheren–Zuid-Beveland–Noord-Beveland peninsula) in the &quot;Holland Hypothesis&quot;.

On 12 March 1940, Gamelin discounted dissenting opinion at GQG and decided that the Seventh Army would advance as far as Breda, to link with the Dutch. Georges was told that the role of the Seventh Army on the left flank of the Dyle manoeuvre would be linked to it and Georges notified Billotte that if it were ordered to cross into the Netherlands, the left flank of the army group was to advance to Tilburg if possible and certainly to Breda. The Seventh Army was to take post between the Belgians and Dutch by passing the Belgians along the Albert Canal and then turning east, a distance of , when the Germans were only distant from Breda. On 16 April, Gamelin also made provision for a German invasion of the Netherlands but not Belgium, by changing the deployment area to be reached by the Seventh Army; the Escaut plan would only be followed if the Germans forestalled the French move into Belgium.

===Allied intelligence===

In the winter of 1939–40, the Belgian consul-general in Cologne had anticipated the angle of advance that Manstein was planning. Through intelligence reports, the Belgians deduced that German forces were concentrating along the Belgian and Luxembourg frontiers. In March 1940, Swiss intelligence detected six or seven &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions on the German-Luxembourg-Belgian border and more motorised divisions were detected in the area. French intelligence were informed through aerial reconnaissance that the Germans were constructing pontoon bridges about halfway over the Our River on the Luxembourg–German border. On 30 April, the French military attaché in Bern warned that the centre of the German assault would come on the Meuse at Sedan, sometime between 8 and 10 May. These reports had little effect on Gamelin, as did similar reports from neutral sources such as the Vatican and a French sighting of a line of German armoured vehicles on the Luxembourg border trailing back inside Germany.

==Prelude==
===German Army===
Germany had mobilised 4,200,000 men of the &quot;Heer&quot; (German Army), 1,000,000 of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German Air Force), 180,000 of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German Navy) and 100,000 of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; (military arm of the Nazi Party). When consideration is made for those in Poland, Denmark and Norway, the Army had 3,000,000 men available for the offensive starting on 10 May 1940. These manpower reserves were formed into 157 divisions. Of these, 135 were earmarked for the offensive, including 42 reserve divisions. The German forces in the west in May and June deployed some 2,439 tanks and 7,378 guns. In 1939–40, 45 per cent of the army was at least 40 years old and 50 per cent of all the soldiers had just a few weeks&#x27; training. The German Army was far from motorised; ten per cent of their army was motorised in 1940 and could muster only 120,000 vehicles, compared with the 300,000 of the French Army. All of the British Expeditionary Force was motorised. Most of the German logistical transport consisted of horse-drawn vehicles. Only 50 per cent of the German divisions available in 1940 were fit for operations, often being worse equipped than the German army of 1914 or their equivalents in the British and French Armies. In the spring of 1940, the German Army was semi-modern; a small number of the best-equipped and &quot;&quot;elite&quot; divisions were offset by many second and third rate divisions&quot;.

Army Group A, commanded by Gerd von Rundstedt, comprised divisions, including seven &quot;Panzer&quot; and was to execute the main movement effort through the Allied defences in the Ardennes. The manoeuvre carried out by the Germans is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Sichelschnitt&quot;, the German translation of the phrase &quot;sickle cut&quot; coined by Winston Churchill after the event. It involved three armies (the 4th, 12th and 16th) and had three &quot;Panzer&quot; corps. The XV had been allocated to the 4th Army but the XLI (Reinhardt) and the XIX (Guderian) were united with the XIV Army Corps of two motorised infantry divisions on a special independent operational level in &quot;Panzergruppe Kleist&quot; (XXII Corps). Army Group B (Fedor von Bock), comprised divisions including three armoured, was to advance through the Low Countries and lure the northern units of the Allied armies into a pocket. It was composed of the 6th and 18th Armies. Army Group C, (General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb) comprising 18 divisions of the 1st and 7th Armies, was to prevent a flanking movement from the east and with launching small holding attacks against the Maginot Line and the upper Rhine.

====Communications====

Wireless proved essential to German success in the battle. German tanks had radio receivers that allowed them to be directed by platoon command tanks, which had voice communication with other units. Wireless allowed tactical control and far quicker improvisation than the opponent. Some commanders regarded the ability to communicate to be the primary method of combat and radio drills were considered to be more important than gunnery. Radio allowed German commanders to co-ordinate their formations, bringing them together for a mass firepower effect in attack or defence. The French numerical advantage in heavy weapons and equipment, which was often deployed in &quot;penny-packets&quot; (dispersed as individual support weapons) was offset. Most French tanks also lacked radio and orders between infantry units were typically passed by telephone or verbally.

The German communications system permitted a degree of communication between air and ground forces. Attached to &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions were the &quot;Fliegerleittruppen&quot; (Tactical Air Control Party troops) in wheeled vehicles. There were too few Sd.Kfz. 251 command vehicles for all of the army but the theory allowed the army in some circumstances to call &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; units to support an attack. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII, equipped with Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers (&quot;Stukas&quot;), was to support the dash to the Channel if Army Group A broke through the Ardennes and kept a Ju 87 and a fighter group on call. On average, they could arrive to support armoured units within 45–75 minutes of orders being issued.

====Tactics====

The German army conducted combined arms operations of mobile offensive formations, with well-trained artillery, infantry, engineer and tank formations, integrated into &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions. The elements were united by wireless communication, which enabled them to work together at a quick tempo and exploit opportunities faster than the Allies. &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions could conduct reconnaissance, advance to contact or defend and attack vital positions and weak spots. Captured ground would be occupied by infantry and artillery as pivot points for further attacks. Although many German tanks were outgunned by their opponents, they could lure Allied tanks onto the divisional anti-tank guns. The avoidance of tank-versus-tank engagements conserved German tanks for the next stage of the offensive, units carrying supplies for three to four days&#x27; operations. The &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions were supported by motorised and infantry divisions.

German tank battalions () were to be equipped with the &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot; III and &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot; IV tanks but shortages led to the use of light &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot; II and even lighter &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot; I instead. The German Army lacked a heavy tank like the French Char B1; French tanks were better designs, more numerous, with superior armour and armament but slower and with inferior mechanical reliability than the German designs. Although the German Army was outnumbered in artillery and tanks, it possessed some advantages over its opponents. The newer German &quot;Panzers&quot; had a crew of five: commander, gunner, loader, driver, and mechanic. Having a trained individual for each task allowed a logical division of labour. French tanks had smaller crews; the commander had to load the main gun, distracting him from observation and tactical deployment. The Germans enjoyed an advantage through the theory of &quot;Auftragstaktik&quot; (mission command) by which officers, NCOs and men were expected to use their initiative and had control over supporting arms, rather than the slower, top-down methods of the Allies.

===&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;===

Army Group B had the support of 1,815 combat aircraft, 487 transport aircraft and 50 gliders; 3,286 combat aircraft supported Army Groups A and C. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was the most experienced, well-equipped and well-trained air force in the world. The combined Allied total was 2,935 aircraft, about half the size of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; could provide close support with dive-bombers and medium bombers but was a broadly based force, intended to support national strategy and could carry out operational, tactical and strategic bombing operations. Allied air forces were mainly intended for army co-operation but the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; could fly air superiority missions, medium-range interdiction, strategic bombing and close air support operations, depending on circumstances. It was not a &quot;Panzer&quot; spearhead arm, since in 1939 fewer than 15 per cent of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft were designed for close support as this was not its main role.

====Flak====

The Germans had an advantage in anti-aircraft guns (&quot;Fliegerabwehrkanone&quot; [&quot;Flak&quot;]), with 2,600  heavy &quot;Flak&quot; guns and 6,700  and . Light &quot;Flak&quot; refers to the number of guns in the German armed forces, including the anti-aircraft defence of Germany and the equipment of training units. (A 9,300-gun &quot;Flak&quot; component with the field army would have needed more troops than the British Expeditionary Force.) The 88 mm Flak had an elevation of −3° to +85° and could be used as artillery i.e. against panzers. The armies which invaded the west had 85 heavy and 18 light batteries belonging to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, 48 companies of light &quot;Flak&quot; integral to divisions of the army and 20 companies of light &quot;Flak&quot; allocated as army troops, a reserve in the hands of HQs above corps, about 700 and 180 guns manned by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ground units and 816 guns manned by the army.

===Allies===

France had spent a higher percentage of its GNP from 1918 to 1935 on its military than other great powers and the government had added a large rearmament effort in 1936. France mobilised about one-third of the male population between the ages of 20 and 45, bringing the strength of its armed forces to 5,000,000. Only 2,240,000 of these served in army units in the north. The British contributed a total strength of 897,000 men in 1939, rising to 1,650,000 by June 1940. Dutch and Belgian manpower reserves amounted to 400,000 and 650,000, respectively.

====Armies====
The French Army had 117 divisions, of which 104 (including 11 in reserve) were for the defence of the north. The British contributed 13 divisions in the BEF, three of which were untrained and poorly-armed labour divisions. Twenty-two Belgian, ten Dutch and two Polish divisions were also part of the Allied order of battle. British artillery strength amounted to 1,280 guns, Belgium fielded 1,338 guns, the Dutch 656 guns and France 10,700 guns, giving an Allied total of about 14,000 guns, 45 per cent more than the Germans. The French Army was also more motorised than its opponent, which still relied on horses. Although the Belgians, British and Dutch had few tanks, the French had 3,254, outnumbering the Germans.

Despite several partial mobilisations since 1936, during the full mobilisation in September 1939, officers were unfamiliar with their duties, technical experts were simultaneously expected to hand over their vehicles, report to recruitment centres and were also exempt from service as essential workers. Reservists flooded the depots leading to shortages of beds and poor sanitary conditions. The army lacked 150,000 pairs of trousers, 350,000 blankets, 415,000 tents and 600,000 pairs of boots. Recruits often left their centres and returned home or drank excessively as they waited around for someone to take charge and integrate them. This was a disastrous process not too dissimilar from that of 1870, though the main German blow fell on Poland initially and not France.

The French mechanised light and heavy armoured divisions (DLM and DCr) were new and not thoroughly trained. Reserve B Divisions were composed of reservists above 30 years old and ill-equipped. A serious qualitative deficiency was a lack of anti-aircraft artillery, mobile anti-tank artillery and wireless, despite the efforts of Gamelin to produce mobile artillery units. Only 0.15 per cent of military spending between 1923 and 1939 had been on radio and other communications equipment; to maintain signals security, Gamelin used telephones and couriers to communicate with field units.

French tactical deployment and the use of mobile units at the operational level of war was also inferior to that of the Germans. The French had 3,254 tanks on the north-eastern front on 10 May, against 2,439 German tanks. Much of the armour was distributed for infantry support, each army having a tank brigade () of about ninety light infantry tanks. With so many tanks available, the French could still concentrate a considerable number of light, medium and heavy tanks in armoured divisions, which in theory were as powerful as German panzer divisions. Only French heavy tanks generally carried wireless but these were unreliable, hampering communication and making tactical manoeuvre difficult, compared to German units. In 1940, French military theorists still mainly considered tanks as infantry support vehicles and French tanks were slow (except for the SOMUA S35) compared to their German rivals, enabling German tanks to offset their disadvantages by out-manoeuvring French tanks. On several occasions, the French were not able to achieve the same tempo as German armoured units. The state of training was also unbalanced, with the majority of personnel trained only to man static fortifications. Very little training for mobile action was carried out between September 1939 and May 1940.

====Deployment====
The French Army comprised three army groups; the 2nd and 3rd Army Groups defended the Maginot Line to the east; the 1st Army Group (General Gaston Billotte) was on the western (left) flank, ready to move into the Low Countries. Initially positioned on the left flank near the coast, the Seventh Army, reinforced by a (DLM, mechanised light division), was intended to move to the Netherlands via Antwerp. To the south of the Seventh Army were the motorised divisions of the BEF, which would advance to the Dyle Line on the right flank of the Belgian army, from Leuven (Louvain) to Wavre. The First Army, reinforced by two DLM and with a (DCR, Armoured Division) in reserve, would defend the Gembloux Gap between Wavre and Namur. The southernmost army involved in the move forward into Belgium was the French Ninth Army, which had to cover the Meuse sector between Namur to the north of Sedan.

Gort expected to have two or three weeks to prepare for the Germans to advance to the Dyle but the Germans arrived in four days. The Second Army was expected to form the &quot;hinge&quot; of the movement and remain entrenched. It was to face the elite German armoured divisions in their attack at Sedan. It was given low priority for manpower, anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons and air support, consisting of five divisions; two were over-age reservist divisions and the 3rd North African Division. Considering their training and equipment, they had to cover a long front and formed a weak point of the French defence system. GQG had anticipated that the Ardennes Forest would be impassable to tanks, even though Belgian army and French intelligence warned them of long armour and transport columns crossing the Ardennes and being stuck in a huge traffic-jam for some time. French war games in 1937 and 1938 had shown that the Germans could penetrate the Ardennes; Corap called it &quot;idiocy&quot; to think that the enemy could not get through. Gamelin ignored the evidence, as it was not in line with his strategy.

===Air forces===

The &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; had RAF Fighter Command 680 and RAF Bomber Command could contribute about Some Allied types, like the Fairey Battle, were approaching obsolescence. In the fighter force, only the British Hawker Hurricane, the US Curtiss Hawk 75 and the Dewoitine D.520 were a match for the German Messerschmitt Bf 109, the D.520 being more manoeuvrable although being slightly slower. On 10 May 1940, only 36 D.520s had been delivered. The Allies outnumbered the Germans in fighter aircraft, with 81 Belgian, 261 British and 764 French fighters (1,106) against 836 German Bf 109s. The French and British had more aircraft in reserve.

In early June 1940, the French aviation industry was producing a considerable number of aircraft, with an estimated reserve of nearly 2,000 but a chronic lack of spare parts crippled this fleet. Only about 599 (29 per cent) were serviceable, of which 170 were bombers. The Germans had six times more medium bombers than the French. Despite its disadvantages, the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; performed far better than expected, destroying 916 enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat, a kill ratio of 2.35:1. Almost a third of the French victories were accomplished by French pilots flying the Curtiss Hawk 75, which accounted for 12.6 per cent of the French single-seat fighter force.

====Anti-aircraft defence====

In addition to 580 machine guns assigned to civilian defence, the French Army had 1,152 anti-aircraft guns, with 200 auto-cannon in the process of delivery and 688 guns and 24 guns, the latter having problems with barrel wear. There were also forty First World War-vintage anti-aircraft guns available. The BEF had ten regiments of QF 3.7-inch (94 mm) heavy anti-aircraft guns, the most advanced in the world and regiments of Bofors 40 mm light anti-aircraft guns, about 300 heavy and 350 light anti-aircraft guns. The Belgians had two heavy anti-aircraft regiments and were introducing Bofors guns for divisional anti-aircraft troops. The Dutch had 84 , 39 elderly , seven , 232 anti-aircraft guns and several hundred First World War-vintage Spandau M.25 machine guns on anti-aircraft mountings.

==Battle==

===Northern front===

At 21:00 on 9 May, the code word was relayed to all German army divisions, beginning . Security was so tight that many officers, due to the constant delays, were away from their units when the order was sent. German forces occupied Luxembourg virtually unopposed. Army Group B launched its feint offensive during the night into the Netherlands and Belgium. On the morning of 10 May, (paratroopers) from the 7th &quot;Flieger&quot; Division and 22nd &quot;Luftlande&quot; Division (Kurt Student) executed surprise landings at The Hague, on the road to Rotterdam and against the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael which helped the advance of Army Group B. The French command reacted immediately, sending the 1st Army Group north in accordance with Plan D. This move committed their best forces, diminishing their fighting power by the partial disorganisation it caused and their mobility by depleting their fuel stocks. By the time the French Seventh Army crossed the Dutch border, they found the Dutch already in full retreat and withdrew into Belgium to protect Antwerp.

====Invasion of the Netherlands====

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; effort over the Netherlands comprised 247 medium bombers, 147 fighters, 424 Junkers Ju 52 transports and 12 Heinkel He 59 seaplanes. The Dutch Air Force (&quot;Militaire Luchtvaartafdeling&quot;, ML) had a strength of 144 combat aircraft, half of which were destroyed on the first day. The remainder of the ML was dispersed and accounted for only a handful of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft shot down. The ML managed 332 sorties, losing 110 aircraft. The German 18th Army captured bridges during the Battle of Rotterdam, bypassing the New Water Line from the south and penetrating Fortress Holland. A separate operation organised by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, the Battle for The Hague, failed. Airfields around Ypenburg, Ockenburg, and Valkenburg were captured in a costly success, with many transport aircraft lost; the Dutch army re-captured the airfields by the end of the day. Ninety-six aircraft in all were lost to Dutch artillery-fire. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; operations resulted in 125 Ju 52s destroyed and 47 damaged, a 50 per cent loss. The airborne operation also cost 50 per cent of the German paratroopers: 4,000 men, including 20 per cent of its NCOs and 42 per cent of its officers; of these casualties, 1,200 were made prisoners of war and evacuated to Britain.
The French Seventh Army failed to block the German armoured reinforcements from the 9th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division, which reached Rotterdam on 13 May. That same day in the east, following the Battle of the Grebbeberg, in which a Dutch counter-attack to contain a German breach failed, the Dutch retreated from the Grebbe line to the New Water Line. The Dutch Army, still largely intact, surrendered in the evening of 14 May after the Bombing of Rotterdam by Heinkel He 111 medium bombers of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 54 (Bomber Wing 54), an act which has remained controversial. The Dutch Army considered its strategic situation to have become hopeless and feared destruction of other Dutch cities. The capitulation document was signed on 15 May, but Dutch forces continued fighting in the Battle of Zeeland with Seventh Army and in the colonies. Queen Wilhelmina established a government in exile in Britain. Dutch casualties amounted to 2,157 army, 75 air force, and 125 Navy personnel; 2,559 civilians were also killed.

====Invasion of Belgium====
The Germans quickly established air superiority over Belgium. Having completed thorough photographic reconnaissance, they destroyed 83 of the 179 aircraft of the within the first 24 hours of the invasion. The Belgians flew 77 operational missions but this contributed little to the air campaign. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was assured air superiority over the Low Countries. Because Army Group B&#x27;s composition had been so weakened compared to the earlier plans, the feint offensive by the 6th Army was in danger of stalling immediately, since the Belgian defences on the Albert Canal position were very strong. The main approach route was blocked by Fort Eben-Emael, a large fortress then generally considered the most modern in Europe, which controlled the junction of the Meuse and the Albert Canal.

Delay might endanger the outcome of the entire campaign, because it was essential that the main body of Allied troops be engaged before Army Group A established bridgeheads. To overcome this difficulty, the Germans resorted to unconventional means in the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. In the early hours of 10 May, DFS 230 gliders landed on top of the fort and unloaded assault teams that disabled the main gun cupolas with hollow charges. The bridges over the canal were seized by German paratroopers. The Belgians launched considerable counterattacks which were broken up by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Shocked by a breach in its defences just where they had seemed the strongest, the Belgian Supreme Command withdrew its divisions to the KW-line five days earlier than planned. Similar operations against the bridges in the Netherlands, at Maastricht, failed. All were blown up by the Dutch and only one railway bridge was taken, which held up the German armour on Dutch territory for a short time.

The BEF and the French First Army were not yet entrenched and the news of the defeat on the Belgian border was unwelcome. The Allies had been convinced Belgian resistance would have given them several weeks to prepare a defensive line at the Gembloux Gap. The XVI &quot;Panzerkorps&quot; (General Erich Hoepner) consisting of the 3rd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and the 4th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division, was launched over the newly captured bridges in the direction of the Gembloux Gap. This seemed to confirm the expectations of the French Supreme Command that the German &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot; (point of main effort, centre of gravity) would be at that point. Gembloux was located between Wavre and Namur, on flat, ideal tank terrain. It was also an unfortified part of the Allied line. To gain time to dig in there, René Prioux, commanding the Cavalry Corps of the French First Army, sent the 2nd DLM and 3rd DLM towards the German armour at Hannut, east of Gembloux. They would provide a screen to delay the Germans and allow sufficient time for the First Army to dig in.

====Battles of Hannut and Gembloux====
The Battle of Hannut (12–13 May) was the largest tank battle yet fought, with about 1,500 armoured fighting vehicles involved. The French knocked out about 160 German tanks for a loss of 105 machines including 30 Somua S35 tanks. The Germans were left in control of the battlefield after the French made a planned withdrawal and were able to repair many of their knocked-out tanks. The net German loss amounted to 20 tanks of the 3rd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and 29 of the 4th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division. Prioux had achieved a tactical and operational success for the French by fulfilling his objective of delaying the panzer divisions until the First Army had time to arrive and dig in. The German attack had engaged the First Army to the north of Sedan, which was the most important objective that Hoepner had to achieve but had failed to forestall the French advance to the Dyle or to destroy the First Army. On 14 May, having been held up at Hannut, Hoepner attacked again, against orders, in the Battle of Gembloux. This was the only occasion when German tanks frontally attacked a fortified position during the campaign. The 1st Moroccan Division repulsed the attack and another 42 tanks of the 4th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division were knocked out, 26 being written off. This second French defensive success was nullified by events further south at Sedan.

===Central front===

====Ardennes====

The advance of Army Group A was to be delayed by Belgian motorised infantry and French mechanised cavalry divisions (DLC, &quot;Divisions Légères de Cavalerie&quot;) advancing into the Ardennes. The main resistance came from the Belgian 1st &quot;Chasseurs Ardennais&quot;, the 1st Cavalry Division, reinforced by engineers and the French 5e &quot;Division Légère de Cavalerie&quot; (5th DLC). The Belgian troops blocked roads, held up the 1st Panzer Division at Bodange for about eight hours and then retired northwards too quickly for the French, who had not arrived. The Belgian barriers proved ineffective when not defended; German engineers were not disturbed as they dismantled the obstacles. The French had insufficient anti-tank capacity to block the surprisingly large number of German tanks they encountered and quickly gave way, withdrawing behind the Meuse.

The German advance was hampered by the number of vehicles trying to force their way along the poor road network. &quot;Panzergruppe Kleist&quot; had more than 41,140 vehicles, which had only four march routes through the Ardennes. French reconnaissance aircrews had reported German armoured convoys by the night of 10/11 May but this was assumed to be secondary to the main attack in Belgium. On the next night, a reconnaissance pilot reported that he had seen long vehicle columns moving without lights; another pilot sent to check reported the same and that many of the vehicles were tanks. Later that day, photographic reconnaissance and pilot reports were of tanks and bridging equipment. On 13 May, &quot;Panzergruppe Kleist&quot; caused a traffic jam about long from the Meuse to the Rhine on one route. While the German columns were sitting targets, the French bomber force attacked the Germans in northern Belgium during the Battle of Maastricht and had failed with heavy losses. In two days, the bomber force had been reduced from 135 to 72.
On 11 May, Gamelin ordered reserve divisions to begin reinforcing the Meuse sector. Because of the danger the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; posed, movement over the rail network was limited to night-time, slowing the reinforcement. The French felt no sense of urgency, as they believed the build-up of German divisions would be correspondingly slow; the French Army did not conduct river crossings unless assured of heavy artillery support. While they were aware that the German tank and infantry formations were strong, they were confident in their strong fortifications and artillery superiority. The capabilities of the French units in the area were dubious; in particular, their artillery was designed for fighting infantry and they were short of anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns. The German advance forces reached the Meuse line late in the afternoon of 12 May. To allow each of the three armies of Army Group A to cross, three bridgeheads were to be established, at Sedan in the south, Monthermé to the north-west and Dinant further north. The first German units to arrive hardly had local numerical superiority; the German artillery had an average of 12 rounds per gun per day, while French artillery had 30 rounds per gun per day.

====Battle of Sedan====

At Sedan, the Meuse Line consisted of a strong defensive belt deep, laid out according to the modern principles of zone defence on slopes overlooking the Meuse valley. It was strengthened by 103 pillboxes, manned by the 147th Fortress Infantry Regiment. Deeper positions were held by the 55th Infantry Division, a grade &quot;B&quot; reserve division. On the morning of 13 May, the 71st Infantry Division was inserted to the east of Sedan, allowing the 55th Infantry Division to narrow its front by a third and deepen its position to over . The division had a superiority in artillery to the German units present. On 13 May, &quot;Panzergruppe Kleist&quot; forced three crossings near Sedan, executed by the 1st &quot;Panzer&quot; Division, 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division. These groups were reinforced by the elite Infantry Regiment &quot;Großdeutschland&quot;. Instead of slowly massing artillery as the French expected, the Germans concentrated most of their air power (lacking artillery) on smashing a hole in a narrow sector of the French lines by carpet bombing and dive bombing. Guderian had been promised extraordinarily heavy air support during a continual eight-hour air attack, from 08:00 am until dusk.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; executed the heaviest air bombardment the world had yet witnessed and the most intense by the Germans during the war. Two &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; (dive bomber wings) attacked, flying 300 sorties against French positions. A total of 3,940 sorties were flown by nine &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; (Bomber Groups). Some of the forward pillboxes were undamaged and the garrisons repulsed the crossing attempts of the 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division. The morale of the troops of the 55th Infantry Division further back was broken by the air attacks and French gunners fled. The German infantry, at a cost of a few hundred casualties, penetrated up to into the French defensive zone by midnight. Even by then, most of the infantry had not crossed. Much of this success was due to the actions of just six German platoons, mainly assault engineers.

The disorder that had begun at Sedan spread further. At 19:00 on 13 May, troops of the 295th Regiment of the 55th Infantry Division were holding the last prepared defensive line at the Bulson ridge behind the river. They were panicked by alarmist rumours that German tanks were already behind them and fled, creating a gap in the French defences before any tanks had crossed the river. This &quot;Panic of Bulson&quot; also involved the divisional artillery. The Germans had not attacked their position and would not do so until 12 hours later, at 07:20 on 14 May. Recognising the gravity of the defeat at Sedan, General Gaston-Henri Billotte, commander of the 1st Army Group, whose right flank pivoted on Sedan, urged that the bridges across the Meuse be destroyed by air attack. He was convinced that &quot;over them will pass either victory or defeat!&quot; That day, every available Allied light bomber was employed in an attempt to destroy the three bridges but lost about 44 per cent of the Allied bomber strength for no result.

====Collapse on the Meuse====
Guderian had indicated on 12 May that he wanted to enlarge the bridgehead to at least . His superior, General Ewald von Kleist, ordered him, on behalf of Hitler, to limit his moves to a maximum of before consolidation. At 11:45 on 14 May, Rundstedt confirmed this order, which implied that the tank units should now start to dig in. Guderian was able to get Kleist to agree on a form of words for a &quot;reconnaissance in force&quot;, by threatening to resign and behind-the-scenes intrigues. Guderian continued the advance, despite the halt order. In the original Manstein plan, as Guderian had suggested, secondary attacks would be carried out to the south-east, in the rear of the Maginot Line. This would confuse the French command and occupy ground where French counter-offensive forces would assemble. This element had been removed by Halder but Guderian sent the 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and Infantry Regiment &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; south over the Stonne plateau.

The commander of the French Second Army, General Charles Huntziger, intended to carry out a counter-attack at the same spot by the &quot;3e Division Cuirassée&quot; (3e DCR, 3rd Armoured Division). The intended attack would eliminate the bridgehead. Both sides attacked and counter-attacked from 15 to 17 May. Huntziger considered this at least a defensive success and limited his efforts to protecting the flank. Success in the Battle of Stonne and the recapture of Bulson would have enabled the French to defend the high ground overlooking Sedan and bombard the bridgehead with observed artillery-fire, even if they could not take it. Stonne changed hands 17 times and fell to the Germans for the last time on the evening of 17 May. Guderian turned the 1st &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and the 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division westwards on 14 May, which advanced swiftly down the Somme valley towards the English Channel.

On 15 May, Guderian&#x27;s motorised infantry fought their way through the reinforcements of the new French Sixth Army in their assembly area west of Sedan, undercutting the southern flank of the French Ninth Army. The Ninth Army collapsed and surrendered &quot;en masse&quot;. The 102nd Fortress Division, its flanks unsupported, was surrounded and destroyed on 15 May at the Monthermé bridgehead by the 6th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and 8th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division without air support. The French Second Army had also been seriously damaged. The Ninth Army was also giving way because they did not have time to dig in, as Erwin Rommel had broken through French lines within 24 hours of the battle&#x27;s beginning. The 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division raced ahead. Rommel refused to allow the division rest and they advanced by day and night. The division advanced in 24 hours.
Rommel lost contact with General Hermann Hoth, having disobeyed orders by not waiting for the French to establish a new line of defence. The 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division continued to advance north-west to Avesnes-sur-Helpe, just ahead of the 1st and 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions. The French 5th Motorised Infantry Division had bivouacked in the path of the German division, with its vehicles neatly lined up along the roadsides and the 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division dashed through them. The slow speed, overloaded crews and lack of battlefield communications undid the French. The 5th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division joined in the fight. The French inflicted many losses on the division. However, they could not cope with the speed of the German mobile units, which closed fast and destroyed the French armour at close range. The remaining elements of the 1st DCR, resting after losing all but 16 of its tanks in Belgium, were also engaged and defeated. The 1st DCR retired with three operational tanks, while defeating only 10 per cent of the 500 German tanks.

By 17 May, Rommel claimed to have taken 10,000 prisoners while suffering only 36 losses. Guderian was delighted with the fast advance and encouraged XIX &quot;Korps&quot; to head for the channel, continuing until fuel was exhausted. Hitler worried that the German advance was moving too fast. Halder recorded in his diary on 17 May,

Through deception and different interpretations of orders to stop from Hitler and Kleist, the front line commanders ignored Hitler&#x27;s attempts to stop the westward advance to Abbeville.

====French leaders====
The French High Command, slow to react because of its strategy of &quot;methodical warfare&quot;, reeled from the shock of the German offensive and was overtaken by defeatism. On the morning of 15 May, the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, telephoned the new British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill and said, &quot;We have been defeated. We are beaten; we have lost the battle.&quot; Churchill, attempting to offer some comfort to Reynaud, reminded him of all the times the Germans had broken through the Allied lines in the First World War only to be stopped but Reynaud was inconsolable.

Churchill flew to Paris on 16 May. He immediately recognised the gravity of the situation when he observed that the French government was already burning its archives and was preparing for an evacuation of the capital. In a sombre meeting with the French commanders, Churchill asked General Gamelin, &quot;Where is the strategic reserve?&quot; referring to the reserve that had saved Paris in the First World War. Gamelin replied:

After the war, Gamelin claimed he said &quot;There is no longer any.&quot; Churchill later described hearing this as the most shocking moment in his life. Churchill asked Gamelin where and when the general proposed to launch a counter-attack against the flanks of the German bulge. Gamelin simply replied &quot;inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of methods.&quot;

====Allied counter-attacks====

Some of the best Allied units in the north had seen little fighting. Had they been kept in reserve, they might have been used in a counter-attack. Pre-war General Staff Studies had concluded that the main reserves were to be kept on French soil to resist an invasion of the Low Countries. They could also deliver a counterattack or &quot;re-establish the integrity of the original front&quot;. Despite having a numerically superior armoured force, the French failed to use it properly or to deliver an attack on the vulnerable German bulge. The Germans combined their fighting vehicles in divisions and used them at the point of main effort. The bulk of French armour was scattered along the front in tiny formations. Most of the French reserve divisions had by now been committed. The 1st DCr had been wiped out when it had run out of fuel and the 3rd DCr had failed to take its opportunity to destroy the German bridgeheads at Sedan. The only armoured division still in reserve, the 2nd DCr, was to attack on 16 May west of Saint-Quentin, Aisne. The division commander could locate only seven of its twelve companies, which were scattered along a front. The formation was overrun by the 8th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division while still forming up and was destroyed as a fighting unit.

The 4th DCr, led by de Gaulle, attempted to launch an attack from the south at Montcornet, where Guderian had his &quot;Korps&quot; headquarters and the 1st &quot;Panzer&quot; Division had its rear services. During the Battle of Montcornet, the French would manage to brush aside the unsuspecting Germans, catching Guderian offguard. Faced with such a threat, a hastily improvised defence was established while Guderian rushed up the 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division to threaten de Gaulle&#x27;s flank. This flank pressure and dive-bombing by &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII (General Wolfram von Richthofen) broke up the attack. French losses on 17 May amounted to 32 tanks and armoured vehicles but the French had inflicted much greater casualties on the Germans. On 19 May, after receiving reinforcements and commandeering nearby units, de Gaulle attacked again. In spite of the 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division&#x27;s arrival, the French would pierce the German defence, coming to within a mile of Guderian&#x27;s headquarters before being checked; having lost 80 out of 155 vehicles. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII relentlessly attacked the French Armour, preventing them from capitalizing on their success and overruning the Germans. Faced with increasingly stiffening German resistance, de Gaulle would ask for further reinforcements, requesting that two Infantry Divisions be brought forward to support his tanks. However, this plea was refused. With no help forthcoming, de Gaulle would finally be forced to retreat on the 20th of May, largely due to heavy German aerial attacks. The defeat of the 4th DCr and the disintegration of the French Ninth Army was caused mainly by the &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;, rather than German infantry and armour. The 4th DCr had achieved a measure of success, causing considerable delays to the German timetable and tying up enemy units, but the attacks on 17 and 19 May had only local effect.

====Channel coast====

On 19 May, General Edmund Ironside, the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), conferred with General Lord Gort, commander of the BEF, at his headquarters near Lens. He urged Gort to save the BEF by attacking south-west toward Amiens. Gort replied that seven of his nine divisions were already engaged on the Scheldt River and he had only two divisions left to mount such an attack. He then said that he was under the orders of General Billotte, the commander of the French 1st Army Group but that Billotte had issued no orders for eight days. Ironside confronted Billotte, whose own headquarters was nearby and found him apparently incapable of taking action. He returned to Britain, concerned that the BEF was doomed and ordered urgent anti-invasion measures.

The German land forces could not remain inactive any longer, since it would allow the Allies to reorganise their defence or escape. On 19 May, Guderian was permitted to start moving again and smashed through the weak 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division and the 23rd (Northumbrian) Division (both Territorial divisions) on the Somme river. The German units occupied Amiens and secured the westernmost bridge over the river at Abbeville. This move isolated the British, French, Dutch and Belgian forces in the north from their supplies. On 20 May, a reconnaissance unit from the 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division reached Noyelles-sur-Mer, to the west of their positions on 17 May. From Noyelles, they were able to see the Somme estuary and the English Channel. A huge pocket, containing the Allied 1st Army Group (the Belgian, British and French First, Seventh and Ninth armies), was created.

&quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII covered the dash to the channel coast. Heralded as the finest hour of the Ju 87 (&quot;Stuka&quot;), these units responded via an extremely efficient communications system to requests for support, which blasted a path for the army. The Ju 87s were particularly effective at breaking up attacks along the flanks of the German forces, breaking fortified positions and disrupting supply routes. Radio-equipped forward liaison officers could call upon the &quot;Stuka&quot;s and direct them to attack Allied positions along the axis of advance. In some cases, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; responded to requests within 10 to 20 minutes. &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Hans Seidemann, the &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; vIII Chief of Staff, said that &quot;never again was such a smoothly functioning system for discussing and planning joint operations achieved&quot;. Closer examination reveals the army had to wait 45–75 minutes for Ju 87 units and ten minutes for Henschel Hs 123s.

===Weygand plan===


On the morning of 20 May, Gamelin ordered the armies trapped in Belgium and northern France to fight their way south and link up with French forces attacking northwards from the Somme river. On the evening of 19 May, the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, had sacked Gamelin and replaced him with Maxime Weygand, who claimed his first mission as Commander-in-Chief would be to get a good night&#x27;s sleep. Gamelin&#x27;s orders were cancelled and Weygand took several days during the crisis to make courtesy visits in Paris. Weygand proposed a counter-offensive by the armies trapped in the north combined with an attack by French forces on the Somme front, the new French 3rd Army Group (General Antoine-Marie-Benoît Besson).

The corridor through which &quot;Panzergruppe von Kleist&quot; had advanced to the coast was narrow and to the north were the three DLMs and the BEF; to the south was the 4th DCR. Allied delays caused by the French change of command gave the German infantry divisions time to follow up and reinforce the panzer corridor. Their tanks had also pushed further along the channel coast. Weygand flew into the pocket on 21 May and met Billotte, the commander of the 1st Army Group and King Leopold III of Belgium. Leopold announced that the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations, as it lacked tanks and aircraft and that unoccupied Belgium had enough food for only two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to endanger itself to keep contact with the Belgian Army but warned that if it persisted with the southern offensive, the Belgian army would collapse. Leopold suggested the establishment of a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports.

Gort doubted that the French could prevail. On 23 May, the situation was worsened by Billotte being killed in a car crash, leaving the 1st Army Group leaderless for three days. He was the only Allied commander in the north briefed on the Weygand plan. That day, the British decided to evacuate from the Channel ports. Only two local offensives, by the British and French in the north at Arras on 21 May and by the French from Cambrai in the south on 22 May, took place. &quot;Frankforce&quot; (Major-General Harold Franklyn) consisting of two divisions, had moved into the Arras area. Franklyn was not aware of a French push north toward Cambrai and the French were ignorant of a British attack towards Arras. Franklyn assumed he was to relieve the Allied garrison at Arras and cut German communications in the vicinity. He was reluctant to commit the 5th Infantry Division and 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, with the 3rd DLM providing flank protection, in a limited objective attack. Only two British infantry battalions and two battalions of the 1st Army Tank Brigade, with 58 Matilda I and 16 Matilda II tanks and an attached motorcycle battalion, took part in the main attack.

The Battle of Arras achieved surprise and initial success against overstretched German forces but failed in its objective. Radio communication between tanks and infantry was poor and there was little combined arms co-ordination as practised by the Germans. German defences (including &quot;FlaK&quot; guns and field guns) eventually stopped the attack. The French knocked out many German tanks as they retired but the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; broke up the counter-attacks and 60 British tanks were lost. The southern attack at Cambrai also failed, because V Corps had been too disorganised after the fighting in Belgium to make a serious effort. OKH panicked at the thought of hundreds of Allied tanks smashing the best forces but Rommel wanted to continue the pursuit. Early on 22 May, OKH recovered and ordered the XIX &quot;Panzerkorps&quot; to press north from Abbeville to the Channel ports. The 1st &quot;Panzer&quot; Division advanced to Calais, the 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division to Boulogne and the 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division to Dunkirk (later, the 1st and 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions&#x27; roles were reversed). South of the German salient, limited French attacks occurred on 23 May near Peronne and Amiens. French and British troops fought the Battle of Abbeville from 27 May to 4 June but failed to eliminate the German bridgehead south of the Somme.

===BEF and the Channel ports===

====Siege of Calais====

In the early hours of 23 May, Gort ordered a retreat from Arras. By now, he had no faith in the Weygand plan, nor in Weygand&#x27;s proposal at least to try to hold a pocket on the Flemish coast, a so-called &quot;Réduit de Flandres&quot;. Gort knew that the ports needed to supply such a foothold were already being threatened. That same day, the 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division had assaulted Boulogne. The remaining French and British there surrendered on 25 May, although 4,286 men were evacuated by Royal Navy ships. The RAF also provided air cover, denying the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; an opportunity to attack the shipping.

The 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division (Ferdinand Schaal) attacked Calais on 24 May. British reinforcements (the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, equipped with cruiser tanks and the 30th Motor Brigade; the latter constituted much of the infantry force that was to have served with British 1st Armoured Division) had been hastily landed 24 hours before the Germans attacked. The defenders held on to the port as long as possible, aware that an early capitulation would free up German forces to advance on Dunkirk. The British and French held the town despite the best efforts of Schaal&#x27;s division to break through. Frustrated, Guderian ordered that, if Calais had not fallen by 14:00 on 26 May, he would withdraw the 10th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and ask the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to destroy the town. Eventually, the French and British ran out of ammunition and the Germans were able to break into the fortified city at around 13:30 on 26 May, 30 minutes before Schaal&#x27;s deadline was up. Despite the French surrender of the main fortifications, the British held the docks until the morning of 27 May. Around 440 men were evacuated. The siege lasted for four crucial days. The delaying action came at a price, about 60 per cent of Allied personnel were killed or wounded.

====Halt orders====
Frieser wrote that the Franco-British counter-attack at Arras had a disproportionate effect on the Germans because the German higher commanders were apprehensive about flank security. Kleist, the commander of , perceived a &quot;serious threat&quot; and informed Halder that he had to wait until the crisis was resolved before continuing. Colonel-General Günther von Kluge, the 4th Army commander ordered the tanks to halt, with the support of Rundstedt. On 22 May, when the attack had been repulsed, Rundstedt ordered that the situation at Arras must be restored before moved on Boulogne and Calais. At OKW, the panic was worse and Hitler contacted Army Group A on 22 May, to order that all mobile units were to operate either side of Arras and infantry units were to operate to the east.

The crisis among the higher staffs of the German army was not apparent at the front and Halder formed the same conclusion as Guderian, that the real threat was that the Allies would retreat to the channel coast too quickly and a race for the channel ports began. Guderian ordered the 2nd Panzer Division to capture Boulogne, the 1st Panzer Division to take Calais and the 10th Panzer division to seize Dunkirk. Most of the BEF and the French First Army were still from the coast but despite delays, British troops were sent from England to Boulogne and Calais just in time to forestall the XIX Corps panzer divisions on 22 May. Frieser wrote that had the panzers advanced at the same speed on 21 May as they had on 20 May, before the halt order stopped their advance for Boulogne and Calais would have fallen. (Without a halt at Montcornet on 15 May and the second halt on 21 May after the Battle of Arras, the final halt order of 24 May would have been irrelevant, because Dunkirk would have already been captured by the 10th Panzer Division.)

====Operation Dynamo====

The British launched Operation Dynamo, which evacuated the encircled British, French and Belgian troops from the northern pocket in Belgium and Pas-de-Calais, beginning on 26 May. About 28,000 men were evacuated on the first day. The French First Army – the bulk of which remained in Lille – fought the Siege of Lille owing to Weygand&#x27;s failure to pull it back along with other French forces to the coast. The 50,000 men involved capitulated on 31 May. While the First Army was mounting its sacrificial defence at Lille, it drew German forces away from Dunkirk, allowing 70,000 Allied soldiers to escape. Total Allied evacuation stood at 165,000 on 31 May. The Allied position was complicated by Belgian King Leopold III&#x27;s surrender on 27 May, which was postponed until 28 May. The gap left by the Belgian Army stretched from Ypres to Dixmude. A collapse was averted at the Battle of Dunkirk and 139,732 British and 139,097 French soldiers were evacuated by sea across the English Channel in Operation Dynamo. Between 31 May and 4 June, another 20,000 British and 98,000 French were saved; about 30,000 to 40,000 French soldiers of the rearguard remained to be captured. The total evacuated was 338,226, including 199,226 British and 139,000 French.

During the Dunkirk battle, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; did its best to prevent the evacuation. It flew 1,882 bombing missions and 1,997 fighter sorties. British losses at Dunkirk made up 6 per cent of their total losses during the French campaign, including 60 precious fighter pilots. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; failed in its task of preventing the evacuation but inflicted serious losses on the Allied forces. 89 merchantmen (of 126,518 grt) were lost; the navy lost 29 of its 40 destroyers sunk or seriously damaged. The Germans lost around 100 aircraft; the RAF lost 106 fighters. Other sources put &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; losses in the Dunkirk area at 240. Confusion still reigned. After the evacuation at Dunkirk, while Paris was enduring a short-lived siege, part of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division was sent to Brittany but was withdrawn after the French capitulation. The 1st Armoured Division under General Evans arrived in France in June and fought in the Battle of Abbeville. It did so without some of its infantry, which had earlier been diverted to the defence of Calais. At the end of the campaign, Erwin Rommel praised the staunch resistance of British forces, despite being under-equipped and without ammunition for much of the fighting.

==&quot;Fall Rot&quot;==

By the end of May 1940, the best and most modern French armies had been sent north and lost in the resulting encirclement; the French had also lost much of their heavy weaponry and their best armoured formations. Overall, the Allies had lost 61 divisions in &quot;Fall Gelb&quot;. Weygand was faced with the prospect of defending a long front (from Sedan to the channel), with a greatly depleted French Army now lacking significant Allied support. Weygand had only 64 French divisions and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division available. Weygand lacked the reserves to counter a breakthrough or to replace frontline troops, should they become exhausted from a prolonged battle on a front of . The Germans had 142 divisions and air supremacy, except over the English Channel. The French also had to deal with millions of civilian refugees fleeing the war in what became known as (the Exodus). Automobiles and horse-drawn carts carrying possessions clogged roads. As the government had not foreseen such a rapid military collapse, there were few plans to cope. Between six and ten million French fled, sometimes so quickly that they left uneaten meals on tables, even while officials stated that there was no need to panic and that civilians should stay. The population of Chartres dropped from 23,000 to 800 and Lille from 200,000 to 20,000, while cities in the south such as Pau and Bordeaux rapidly grew in population.

===Weygand line===
The Germans began their second offensive on 5 June on the Somme and the Aisne. During the next three weeks, far from the easy advance the expected, they encountered strong resistance from a rejuvenated French Army. The French armies had fallen back on their lines of supply and communications and were closer to repair shops, supply dumps and stores. About 112,000 French soldiers from Dunkirk were repatriated via the Normandy and Brittany ports, a partial substitute for the lost divisions in Flanders. The French were also able to make good a significant amount of their armoured losses and raised the 1st and 2nd DCR (heavy armoured divisions). The 4th DCR also had its losses replaced. Morale rose and was very high by the end of May 1940. Most French soldiers that joined the line only knew of German success by hearsay.

French officers had gained tactical experience against German mobile units and had more confidence in their weapons after seeing that their artillery and tanks performed better than German armour. The French tanks were now known to have better armour and armament. Between 23 and 28 May, the French Seventh and Tenth armies were reconstituted. Weygand decided to implement defence in depth and use delaying tactics to inflict maximum attrition on German units. Small towns and villages were fortified for all-round defence as tactical hedgehogs. Behind the front line, the new infantry, armoured and half-mechanised divisions formed up, ready to counter-attack and relieve the surrounded units, which were to hold out at all costs.

The 47 divisions of Army Group B attacked either side of Paris with the majority of the mobile units. After 48 hours, the German offensive had not broken through. On the Aisne, the XVI &quot;Panzerkorps&quot; employed over 1,000 AFVs in two &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions and a motorised division against the French. German offensive tactics were crude and Hoepner soon lost 80 out of 500 AFVs in the first attack. The 4th Army captured bridgeheads over the Somme but the Germans struggled to get over the Aisne. At Amiens, the Germans were repeatedly driven back by French artillery-fire and realised that French tactics were much improved.

The German Army relied on the to silence French artillery, to enable German infantry to inch forward. German progress was made only late on the third day of operations, finally forcing crossings. The French Air Force () attempted to bomb them but failed. German sources acknowledged the battle was &quot;hard and costly in lives, the enemy putting up severe resistance, particularly in the woods and tree lines continuing the fight when our troops had pushed past the point of resistance&quot;. South of Abbeville, the French Tenth Army (General Robert Altmayer) was forced to retreat to Rouen and then south over the Seine. The 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division forced the surrender of the British 51st (Highland) Division and the French IX Corps on 12 June at Saint-Valery-en-Caux, then crossed the Seine river to race through Normandy, capturing the port of Cherbourg on 18 June. German spearheads were overextended and vulnerable to counter-attack but the denied the French the ability to concentrate and the fear of air attack negated their mass and mobility.
On 10 June, Reynaud declared Paris an open city. The German 18th Army then deployed against Paris. The French resisted the approaches to the capital strongly but the line was broken in several places. Weygand asserted it would not take long for the French Army to disintegrate. On 13 June, Churchill attended a meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme War Council at Tours and suggested a Franco-British Union but this was refused. On 14 June, Paris fell. Parisians who stayed in the city found that in most cases the Germans were extremely well mannered.

The gained air supremacy as the was brought to the verge of collapse. The French had only just begun to make the majority of bomber sorties; between 5 and 9 June (during Operation Paula), over 1,815 sorties, 518 by bombers, were flown. The number of sorties declined as losses became impossible to replace. After 9 June, French aerial resistance virtually ceased; some surviving aircraft withdrew to French North Africa. The exploited its dominance, concentrating on the direct and indirect support of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. The attacked lines of resistance, which then quickly collapsed under armoured attack. The RAF attempted to divert the attention of the with 660 sorties flown against targets over the Dunkirk area but suffered many losses. On 21 June, 37 Bristol Blenheims were destroyed.

===Collapse of the Maginot line===
To the east, Army Group C was to help Army Group A encircle and capture the French forces on the Maginot line. The goal of the operation was to envelop the Metz region with its fortifications, to prevent a French counter-offensive from the Alsace region against the German line on the Somme. XIX &quot;Korps&quot; (Guderian) was to advance to the French border with Switzerland and trap the French forces in the Vosges Mountains while the XVI &quot;Korps&quot; attacked the Maginot Line from the west, into its vulnerable rear, to take the cities of Verdun, Toul and Metz. The French had moved the 2nd Army Group from Alsace and Lorraine to the &#x27;Weygand line&#x27; on the Somme, leaving only small forces guarding the Maginot line. After Army Group B had begun its offensive against Paris and into Normandy, Army Group A began its advance into the rear of the Maginot line. On 15 June, Army Group C launched Operation Tiger, a frontal assault across the Rhine and into France.

German attempts to break open or into the Maginot line prior to Tiger had failed. One assault lasted for eight hours on the extreme north of the line, costing the Germans 46 dead and 251 wounded for two French killed (one at Ferme-Chappy and one at Fermont fortress). On 15 June, the last well-equipped French forces, including the Fourth Army, were preparing to leave as the Germans struck. The French force now holding the line was exiguous; the Germans greatly outnumbered the French. They could call upon the I &quot;Armeekorps&quot; of seven divisions and 1,000 artillery pieces, although most were First World War vintage and could not penetrate the thick armour of the fortresses. Only guns could do the job and 16 were allocated to the operation. To bolster this, and eight railway batteries were also employed. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; deployed the &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; V.

The battle was difficult and slow progress was made against strong French resistance. Each fortress was overcome one by one. One fortress (Schoenenbourg) fired 15,802 rounds at attacking German infantry. It was the most heavily shelled of all the French positions but its armour protected it from fatal damage. On the day that Tiger was launched, (Operation Little Bear) began. Five divisions of the VII &quot;Armeekorps&quot; crossed the Rhine into the Colmar area with a view to advancing to the Vosges Mountains. The force had 400 artillery pieces, reinforced by heavy artillery and mortars. The French 104th Division and 105th Division were forced back into the Vosges Mountains on 17 June. On the same day, XIX &quot;Korps&quot; reached the Swiss border the Maginot defences were cut off from the rest of France. Most units surrendered on 25 June and the Germans claimed to have taken 500,000 prisoners. Some main fortresses continued the fight, despite appeals for surrender. The last only capitulated on 10 July, after a request from Georges and only then under protest. Of the 58 main fortifications on the Maginot Line, ten were captured by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

===Second BEF evacuation===

The evacuation of the second BEF took place during Operation Aerial between 15 and 25 June. The , with air supremacy, was determined to prevent more Allied evacuations after the Dunkirk . 1 was assigned to the Normandy and Brittany sectors. On 9 and 10 June, the port of Cherbourg was subject to of German bombs, while Le Havre received 10 bombing attacks that sank 2,949 GRT of Allied shipping. On 17 June, Junkers Ju 88smainly from 30sank a &quot;10,000 tonne ship&quot;, the 16,243 GRT liner off St Nazaire, killing about 4,000 Allied troops and civilians. This was nearly double the British killed in the Battle of France, yet the failed to prevent the evacuation of 190,000–200,000 Allied personnel.

===Battle of the Alps===
Italy declared war on France and Britain on 10 June but it was not prepared for war and made little impact during the last two weeks of fighting in the Italian invasion of France. The Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, sought to profit from the German success. Mussolini felt the conflict would soon end and he reportedly said to the army Chief-of-Staff, Marshal Pietro Badoglio, &quot;I only need a few thousand dead so that I can sit at the peace conference as a man who has fought&quot;. Opposite the Italians was the French Army of the Alps (General Rene Olry). In two weeks of fighting, the Italian 1st Army and 4th Army advanced a few kilometres intro French territory against determined French resistance but the offensive was halted on the negotiation of the Franco-Italian Armistice. Only the city of Menton and few Alpine towns had been captured by Italian forces.

===Armistice===

Discouraged by his cabinet&#x27;s hostile reaction to a British proposal for a Franco-British union to avoid defeat and believing that his ministers no longer supported him, Reynaud resigned on 16 June. He was succeeded by Pétain, who delivered a radio address to the French people announcing his intention to ask for an armistice with Germany. When Hitler received word from the French government that they wished to negotiate an armistice, he selected the Forest of Compiègne as the site for the negotiations. Compiègne had been the site of the 1918 Armistice, which ended the First World War with a humiliating defeat for Germany; Hitler viewed the choice of location as a supreme moment of revenge for Germany over France.

On 21 June 1940, Hitler visited the site to start the negotiations, which took place in the same railway carriage in which the 1918 Armistice was signed. It had just been removed from a museum building and placed on the spot where it was located in 1918. Hitler sat in the same chair in which Marshal Ferdinand Foch had sat when he faced the defeated German representatives. After listening to the reading of the preamble, Hitler left the carriage in a calculated gesture of disdain for the French delegates and negotiations were turned over to Wilhelm Keitel, the chief of staff of OKW. The armistice was signed on the next day at 18:36 (French time), by General Keitel for Germany and Huntziger for France. The armistice and cease-fire went into effect two days and six hours later, at 00:35 on 25 June, once the Franco-Italian Armistice had also been signed, at 18:35 on 24 June, near Rome. On 27 June, German troops occupied the coast of the Basque Country between France and Spain.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

The title of Ernest May&#x27;s book &quot;Strange Victory: Hitler&#x27;s Conquest of France&quot; (2000) nods to an earlier analysis, &quot;Strange Defeat&quot; (written 1940; published 1946) by the historian Marc Bloch (1886–1944), a participant in the battle. May wrote that Hitler had better insight into the French and British governments than vice-versa and knew that they would not go to war over Austria and Czechoslovakia, because he concentrated on politics rather than the state and national interest. From 1937 to 1940, Hitler gave his views on events, their importance and his intentions, then defended them against contrary opinion from the likes of the former Chief of the General Staff Ludwig Beck and Ernst von Weizsäcker. Hitler sometimes concealed aspects of his thinking but he was unusually frank about priority and his assumptions. May referred to John Wheeler-Bennett (1964),

May asserted that in Paris, London and other capitals, there was an inability to believe that someone might &quot;want&quot; another world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were &quot;reticent&quot; (to resist German aggression), which limited dissent at the cost of enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment and in September 1938 presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was really in Germany&#x27;s favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.

Hitler had miscalculated Franco-British reactions to the invasion of Poland in September 1939, because he had not realised that a shift in public opinion had occurred in mid-1939. May wrote that the French and British could have defeated Germany in 1938 with Czechoslovakia as an ally and also in late 1939, when German forces in the West were incapable of preventing a French occupation of the Ruhr, which would have forced a capitulation or a futile German resistance in a war of attrition. France did not invade Germany in 1939 because it wanted British lives to be at risk too and because of hopes that a blockade might force a German surrender without a bloodbath. The French and British also believed that they were militarily superior, which guaranteed victory. The run of victories enjoyed by Hitler from 1938 to 1940 could only be understood in the context of defeat being inconceivable to French and British leaders.

May wrote that when Hitler demanded a plan to invade France in September 1939, the German officer corps thought that it was foolhardy and discussed a coup d&#x27;état, only backing down when doubtful of the loyalty of the soldiers to them. With the deadline for the attack on France being postponed so often, OKH had time to revise (Case Yellow) for an invasion over the Belgian Plain several times. In January 1940, Hitler came close to ordering the invasion but was prevented by bad weather. Until the Mechelen incident in January forced a fundamental revision of &quot;Fall Gelb&quot;, the main effort () of the German army in Belgium would have been confronted by first-rate French and British forces, equipped with more and better tanks and with a great advantage in artillery. After the Mechelen Incident, OKH devised an alternative and hugely risky plan to make the invasion of Belgium a decoy, switch the main effort to the Ardennes, cross the Meuse and reach the Channel coast. May wrote that although the alternative plan was called the Manstein plan, Guderian, Manstein, Rundstedt, Halder and Hitler had been equally important in its creation.

War games held by (Major-General) Kurt von Tippelskirch, the chief of army intelligence and Oberst Ulrich Liss of (FHW, Foreign Armies West), tested the concept of an offensive through the Ardennes. Liss thought that swift reactions could not be expected from the &quot;systematic French or the ponderous English&quot; and used French and British methods, which made no provision for surprise and reacted slowly when one was sprung. The results of the war games persuaded Halder that the Ardennes scheme could work, even though he and many other commanders still expected it to fail. May wrote that without the reassurance of intelligence analysis and the results of the war games, the possibility of Germany adopting the ultimate version of would have been remote. The French Dyle-Breda variant of the Allied deployment plan was based on an accurate prediction of German intentions, until the delays caused by the winter weather and shock of the Mechelen Incident, led to the radical revision of . The French sought to assure the British that they would act to prevent the using bases in the Netherlands and the Meuse valley and to encourage the Belgian and Dutch governments. The politico-strategic aspects of the plan ossified French thinking, the Phoney War led to demands for Allied offensives in Scandinavia or the Balkans and the plan to start a war with the USSR. French generals thought that changes to the Dyle-Breda variant might lead to forces being taken from the Western Front.

French and British intelligence sources were better than the German equivalents, which suffered from too many competing agencies but Allied intelligence analysis was not as well integrated into planning or decision-making. Information was delivered to operations officers but there was no mechanism like the German system of allowing intelligence officers to comment on planning assumptions about opponents and allies. The insularity of the French and British intelligence agencies meant that had they been asked if Germany would continue with a plan to attack across the Belgian plain after the Mechelen Incident, they would not have been able to point out how risky the Dyle-Breda variant was. May wrote that the wartime performance of the Allied intelligence services was abysmal. Daily and weekly evaluations had no analysis of fanciful predictions about German intentions. A May 1940 report from Switzerland that the Germans would attack through the Ardennes was marked as a German spoof. More items were obtained about invasions of Switzerland or the Balkans, while German behaviour consistent with an Ardennes attack, such as the dumping of supplies and communications equipment on the Luxembourg border or the concentration of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air reconnaissance around Sedan and Charleville-Mézières, was overlooked.

According to May, French and British rulers were at fault for tolerating poor performance by the intelligence agencies; that the Germans could achieve surprise in May 1940, showed that even with Hitler, the process of executive judgement in Germany had worked better than in France and Britain. May referred to &quot;Strange Defeat&quot; that the German victory was a &quot;triumph of intellect&quot;, which depended on Hitler&#x27;s &quot;methodical opportunism&quot;. May further asserted that, despite Allied mistakes, the Germans could not have succeeded but for outrageous good luck. German commanders wrote during the campaign and after, that often only a small difference had separated success from failure. Prioux thought that a counter-offensive could still have worked up to 19 May but by then, roads were crowded with Belgian refugees when they were needed for redeployment and the French transport units, which performed well in the advance into Belgium, failed for lack of plans to move them back. Gamelin had said &quot;It is all a question of hours.&quot; but the decision to sack Gamelin and appoint Weygand, caused a two-day delay.

===Occupation===


France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north and west and a (free zone) in the south. Both zones were nominally under the sovereignty of the French rump state headed by Pétain that replaced the Third Republic; this rump state is often referred to as Vichy France. De Gaulle, who had been made an Undersecretary of National Defence by Reynaud in London at the time of the armistice, refused to recognise Pétain&#x27;s Vichy government as legitimate. He delivered the Appeal of 18 June, the beginning of Free France.

The British doubted Admiral François Darlan&#x27;s promise not to allow the French fleet at Toulon to fall into German hands by the wording of the armistice conditions. They feared the Germans would seize the fleet, docked at ports in Vichy France and North Africa and use them in an invasion of Britain (Operation Sea Lion). Within a month, the Royal Navy conducted the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir against French ships at Oran. The British Chiefs of Staff Committee had concluded in May 1940 that if France collapsed, &quot;we do not think we could continue the war with any chance of success&quot; without &quot;full economic and financial support&quot; from the United States. Churchill&#x27;s desire for American aid led in September to the Destroyers for Bases agreement that began the Atlantic Charter, the wartime Anglo-American partnership.

The occupation of the various French zones continued until November 1942, when the Allies began Operation Torch, the invasion of Western North Africa. To safeguard southern France, the Germans enacted &quot;Case Anton&quot; and occupied Vichy France. In June 1944, the Western Allies launched Operation Overlord, followed by the Operation Dragoon on the French Mediterranean coast on 15 August. This threatened to cut off German troops in western and central France and most began to retire toward Germany (The fortified French Atlantic U-boat bases remained as pockets until the German capitulation.). On 24 August 1944, Paris was liberated and by September 1944 most of the country was in Allied hands.

The Free French provisional government declared the re-establishment of a provisional French Republic to ensure continuity with the defunct Third Republic. It set about raising new troops to participate in the advance to the Rhine and the Western Allied invasion of Germany by using the French Forces of the Interior as military cadres and manpower pools of experienced fighters to allow a very large and rapid expansion of the French Liberation Army (&quot;Armée française de la Libération&quot;). It was well equipped and well supplied despite the economic disruption brought by the occupation thanks to Lend-Lease and grew from 500,000 men in the summer of 1944 to over 1,300,000 by V-E day, making it the fourth largest Allied army in Europe.

The 2e Division Blindée (2nd Armoured Division), part of the Free French forces that had participated in the Normandy Campaign and had liberated Paris, went on to liberate Strasbourg on 23 November 1944, fulfilling the Oath of Kufra made by General Leclerc almost four years earlier. The unit under his command, barely above company size when it had captured the Italian fort, had grown into an armoured division. The I Corps was the spearhead of the Free French First Army that had landed in Provence as a part of Operation Dragoon. Its leading unit, the 1re Division Blindée, was the first Western Allied unit to reach the Rhône (25 August), the Rhine (19 November) and the Danube (21 April 1945). On 22 April, it captured the Sigmaringen enclave in Baden-Württemberg, where the last Vichy regime exiles were hosted by the Germans in one of the ancestral castles of the Hohenzollern dynasty.

By the end of the war, some 580,000 French citizens had died (40,000 of these were killed by the western Allied forces during the bombardments of the first 48 hours of Operation Overlord). Military deaths were 55,000–60,000 in 1939–40. Some 58,000 were killed in action from 1940 to 1945 fighting in the Free French forces. Some 40,000 &quot;malgré-nous&quot; (&quot;against our will&quot;, citizens of the re-annexed Alsace-Lorraine province drafted into the Wehrmacht) became casualties. Civilian casualties amounted to around 150,000 (60,000 by aerial bombing, 60,000 in the resistance and 30,000 murdered by German occupation forces). Prisoners of war and deportee totals were around 1,900,000; of these, around 240,000 died in captivity. An estimated 40,000 were prisoners of war, 100,000 racial deportees, 60,000 political prisoners and 40,000 died as slave labourers.

===Casualties===
German casualties are hard to determine but commonly accepted figures are: 27,074 killed, 111,034 wounded and 18,384 missing. German deaths may have been as high as 45,000 men, due to non-combat causes, such as death from wounds and missing who were later listed as dead. The battle cost the 28 per cent of its front line strength; some 1,236–1,428 aircraft were destroyed (1,129 to enemy action, 299 in accidents), 323–488 were damaged (225 to enemy action, 263 in accidents), making 36 per cent of the strength lost or damaged. casualties amounted to 6,653 men, including 4,417 airmen; of these 1,129 were killed and 1,930 were reported missing or captured, many of whom were liberated from French prison camps upon the French capitulation. Italian casualties amounted to 631 or 642 men killed, 2,631 wounded and 616 reported missing. A further 2,151 men suffered from frostbite during the campaign. The official Italian numbers were compiled for a report on 18 July 1940, when many of the fallen still lay under snow and it is probable that most of the Italian missing were dead. Units operating in more difficult terrain had higher ratios of missing to killed but probably most of the missing had died.

According to the French Defence Historical Service, 85,310 French military personnel were killed (including 5,400 Maghrebis); 12,000 were reported missing, 120,000 were wounded and 1,540,000 prisoners (including 67,400 Maghrebis) were taken. Some recent French research indicates that the number of killed was between 55,000 and 85,000, a statement of the French Defence Historical Service tending to the lower end. In August 1940, 1,540,000 prisoners were taken into Germany, where roughly 940,000 remained until 1945, when they were liberated by advancing Allied forces. At least 3,000 Senegalese Tirailleurs were murdered after being taken prisoner. While in captivity, 24,600 French prisoners died; 71,000 escaped; 220,000 were released by various agreements between the Vichy government and Germany; several hundred thousand were paroled because of disability and/or sickness. Air losses are estimated at 1,274 aircraft destroyed during the campaign. French tank losses amount to 1,749 tanks (43 per cent of tanks engaged), of which 1,669 were lost to gunfire, 45 to mines and 35 to aircraft. Tank losses are amplified by the large numbers that were abandoned or scuttled and then captured.

The BEF suffered or died of wounds, and missing or taken prisoner. About 64,000 vehicles were destroyed or abandoned and 2,472 guns were destroyed or abandoned. RAF losses from 10 May – 22 June, amounted to 931 aircraft and 1,526 casualties. The Allied naval forces also lost 243 ships to bombing in Dynamo. Belgian losses were 6,093 killed, 15,850 wounded and more than 500 missing. Those captured amounted to 200,000 men, of whom 2,000 died in captivity. The Belgians also lost 112 aircraft. The Dutch Armed forces lost 2,332 killed and 7,000 wounded. Polish losses were around 5,500 killed or wounded and 16,000 prisoners, nearly 13,000 troops of the 2nd Infantry Division were interned in Switzerland for the duration of the war.

===Popular reaction in Germany===

Hitler had expected a million Germans to die in conquering France; instead, his goal was accomplished in just six weeks with only 27,000 Germans killed, 18,400 missing and 111,000 wounded, little more than a third of the German casualties in the Battle of Verdun during World War I. The unexpectedly swift victory resulted in a wave of euphoria among the German population and a strong upsurge in war-fever. Hitler&#x27;s popularity reached its peak with the celebration of the French capitulation on 6 July 1940.

On 19 July, during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony at the Kroll Opera House in Berlin, Hitler promoted 12 generals to the rank of field marshal.
* Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander in Chief of the Army
* Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (&quot;OKW&quot;)
* Gerd von Rundstedt, Commander in chief of Army Group A
* Fedor von Bock, Commander in chief of Army Group B
* Wilhelm von Leeb, Commander in chief of Army Group C
* Günther von Kluge, Commander of the 4th Army
* Wilhelm List, Commander of the 12th Army
* Erwin von Witzleben, Commander of the 1st Army
* Walther von Reichenau, Commander of the 6th Army
* Albert Kesselring, Commander of Luftflotte 2 (Air Fleet 2)
* Erhard Milch, Inspector General of the Luftwaffe
* Hugo Sperrle, Commander of the Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3)

This number of promotions to what had previously been the highest rank in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (Hermann Göring, Commander in chief of the Luftwaffe and already a Field Marshal, was elevated to the new rank of &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot;) was unprecedented. In the First World War, Kaiser Wilhelm II had promoted only five generals to Field Marshal.

===Witness accounts===
* &quot;From Lemberg to Bordeaux&quot; (&quot;Von Lemberg bis Bordeaux&quot;), written by Leo Leixner, a journalist and war correspondent, is a witness account of the battles that led to the fall of Poland and France. In August 1939, Leixner joined the Wehrmacht as a war reporter, was promoted to sergeant and in 1941 published his recollections. The book was originally issued by Franz Eher Nachfolger, the central publishing house of the Nazi Party.
* &quot;Tanks Break Through!&quot; (&quot;Panzerjäger Brechen Durch!&quot;), written by Alfred-Ingemar Berndt, a journalist and close associate of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, is a witness account of the battles that led to the fall of France. When the 1940 attack was in the offing, Berndt joined the Wehrmacht, was sergeant in an anti-tank division and afterward published his recollections. The book was originally issued by Franz Eher Nachfolger, the central publishing house of the Nazi Party, in 1940.
* &quot;Escape via Berlin&quot; (&quot;De Gernika a Nueva York&quot;), written by José Antonio Aguirre, president of the Basque Country, describes his passage through occupied France and Belgium on his way to exile. Aguirre supported the loyalist side during the Spanish Civil war and was forced to exile in France, where the German invasion took him by surprise. He joined the wave of refugees trying to flee France and finally managed to escape to the United States through a long journey involving disguise.
* &quot;Berlin Diary&quot;, published in 1941 by William L. Shirer, a foreign correspondent for &quot;CBS World News Roundup&quot; before the war, gives a day-by-day account of his reporting before, during, and after the Battle of France, including conversations with military and political leadersas well as ordinary soldiers and civilianson both sides. Unable to continue reporting the war honestly from Berlin due to increasing German censorship, Shirer returned to the United States in December 1940.

<text>Wendell Johnson (April 16, 1906 – August 29, 1965) was an American psychologist, author and was a proponent of general semantics (or GS). His life work contributed greatly to speech–language pathology, particularly in understanding the area of stuttering, as Johnson himself stuttered. The Wendell Johnson Speech and Hearing Center at University of Iowa is named after him. Aside from his contributions to stuttering, he posthumously became known for his controversial experiment nicknamed the &quot;Monster Study&quot;.

== Early life ==
Wendell Andrew Leroy Johnson was born April 16, 1906 in Roxbury, Kansas as the youngest child to Swedish immigrants Andrew and Mary Johnson. His family lived on a farm.

Johnson began to stutter when he was around the age of five or six. He requested to be sent to schools to fix his stutter and was willing to try anything to cure it, but it proved to be lifelong.

Johnson was president of his high school class, captain of the football, baseball, and basketball teams, and valedictorian. He spent 2 years at a local college before moving to Iowa City, Iowa, to attend the University of Iowa. He chose this school due to their renowned Speech Clinic in hopes to have his stutter cured.

==Professional contributions==
===Stuttering===
Considered one of the earliest and most influential speech pathologists in the field, Johnson spent most of his life trying to find the cause and cure for stuttering – through teaching, research, scholarly and other writing, lecturing, supervision of graduate students, and persuading K-12 schools, the Veterans Administration and other institutions of the need for speech pathologists. He played a major role in the creation of the American Speech and Hearing Association.

He was the first and most influential to introduce General Semantics into Speech Pathology, particularly stuttering and believed that &quot;Stuttering often begins, not in the child&#x27;s mouth, but in the parent&#x27;s ear.&quot; He posited that when children who experience disfluent moments are told that they stutter - typically by well-meaning parents or therapists - it contributes and is a driving factor for why stuttering continues.

Patricia Zebrowski, University of Iowa assistant professor of speech pathology and audiology, notes, &quot;The body of data that resulted from Johnson&#x27;s work on children who stutter and their parents is still the largest collection of scientific information on the subject of stuttering onset. Although new work has determined that children who stutter are doing something different in their speech production than non-stutterers, Johnson was the first to talk about the importance of a stutterer&#x27;s thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and feelings. We still don&#x27;t know what causes stuttering, but the &#x27;Iowa&#x27; way of approaching study and treatment is still heavily influenced by Johnson, but with an added emphasis on speech production.&quot;

===Publications===

In 1930 Johnson published the book &quot;Because I Stutter&quot;, based on his master&#x27;s thesis, which describes his struggles with stuttering from an autobiographical perspective.

:The stutterer, if I may speak for him as a type, does not want pity any more than he wants contempt, but he does want the understanding which the normal respect of one human being for another makes possible. He is a human being, trying to make a stutterer&#x27;s adaptation to a world of glib speakers.

Johnson&#x27;s book &quot;People in Quandaries: The Semantics of Personal Adjustment&quot; (1946; still in print from the Institute of General Semantics) is an introduction to general semantics applied to psychotherapy. In 1956 his &quot;Your Most Enchanted Listener&quot; was published; in 1972, his &quot;Living With Change: The Semantics of Coping,&quot; a collection of selected portions of transcriptions of hundreds of his talks, organized by Dorothy Moeller, provided further general semantic insights. He also published many articles in his lifetime, in journals, including &quot;ETC: A Review of General Semantics&quot;. [1] Neil Postman acknowledges the influence of &quot;People in Quandaries&quot; in his own general semantics book &quot;Crazy Talk, Stupid Talk&quot; (1976, Delacorte, New York)

===Monster Study===

Wendell Johnson developed a study with the hopes of gathering a better understanding into the depths of stuttering. During the fall of 1938, Wendell Johnson recruited Mary Tudor, one of his clinical psychology graduate students. His goal was to see if telling a non-stuttering child that they stuttered would cause stuttering, and if telling a stuttering child they did not stutter would cure them.

One of the issues that arose from this study was the use of children without the use of informed consent.

==Personal life==
At age 20, Wendell Johnson began his studies at the University of Iowa in 1926. He won honors in English and Journalism before switching to Psychology. He went on to earn his PhD in Clinical Psychology and Speech Pathology in 1931.

Johnson met his wife, Edna Amanda Bockwoldt, at the University of Iowa and they married May 31, 1929 in Galva, Iowa. They had 2 children.

In 1936, Johnson had to be rushed to the hospital for an appendicitis at age 30. It was at this time he read the book Science and Sanity and learned about general semantics for the first time.

His son, Nicholas Johnson (September 23, 1934) was the former American Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner from the years 1966 to 1973.

In 1965, the year of Wendell Johnson&#x27;s death, he was in the process of writing the Encyclopædia Britannica entry on “Speech Disorders”, defending both his work and his study when he had a heart attack. Although not fully completed, his 4,000 word essay was still published. He was only 59.

<text>Freda Charcilia Payne (born September 19, 1942) is an American singer and actress. Payne is best known for her career in music during the mid-1960s through the mid-1980s. Her most notable record is her 1970 hit single &quot;Band of Gold&quot;. Payne was also an actress in musicals and film as well as the host of a TV talk show. Payne is the older sister of Scherrie Payne, a former singer with the American vocal group the Supremes. She also acted on &quot;Living Single&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Payne was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up listening to jazz singers, such as Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. As a teenager, she attended the Detroit Institute of Musical Arts; she soon began singing radio commercial jingles and took part in (and won many) local TV and radio talent shows. In 1963, she moved to New York City and worked with many entertainers, including Quincy Jones, Pearl Bailey, and Bill Cosby. The next year, her debut album, a jazz recording with arranger Manny Albam titled &quot;After the Lights Go Down Low and Much More!!!&quot; was released on the Impulse! label. (This album was re-issued on CD in Japan in early 2002 and again in the United States in 2005.) In 1965 she toured Europe for the first time, recording an album in Sweden with Don Gardner and Bengt-Arne Wallin. In 1966, she released her second American album, again in the jazz idiom, &quot;How Do You Say I Don&#x27;t Love You Anymore&quot;, for MGM Records. She also made occasional guest appearances on television shows including &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

She added theatrical credits to her repertoire: she understudied Leslie Uggams for the Broadway show &quot;Hallelujah Baby&quot; in 1967, and appeared with the Equity Theatre in a production of &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;. In 1969, her old friends back home in Detroit, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland, persuaded her to sign with their newly formed record label Invictus. During that same year, her first Invictus single, &quot;Unhooked Generation&quot; (a minor R&amp;B hit), was released. Shortly thereafter, Eddie Holland offered her a song entitled &quot;Band of Gold&quot;, which he wrote along with Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Ronald Dunbar. In early 1970, the song became an instant pop smash reaching No. 3 in the US and No. 1 in the UK for six consecutive weeks; it also gave Payne her first gold record. Global sales were estimated at two million. An album of the same name proved to be fairly successful as well. Other Invictus singles included &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;, which reached No. 24 in the US and No. 33 in the UK at the end of 1970; &quot;You Brought the Joy&quot;, and the Vietnam War protest song &quot;Bring the Boys Home&quot; (U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 12, 1971), her second gold record. Her other Invictus albums were &quot;Contact&quot; (1971), &quot;The Best of Freda Payne&quot; (1972, a compilation which included four new, unissued songs), and her last Invictus album &quot;Reaching Out&quot; (1973).

In 1973, she left Invictus and recorded albums for ABC/Dunhill and Capitol, but she never found the commercial success that she had enjoyed with Invictus. She recorded a duet &quot;I Wanna See You Soon&quot; with Capitol stablemates Tavares. She released three disco albums for Capitol from 1977 to 1979, &quot;Stares and Whispers&quot;, &quot;Supernatural High&quot; and &quot;Hot&quot;. The first one features the disco hit &quot;Love Magnet&quot; produced by Frank Wilson (1977).

In 1981, she briefly hosted her own talk show &quot;Today&#x27;s Black Woman&quot;, and also found work acting in different movies, Broadway and other theatre productions throughout the 1980s. Although she was concentrating more on acting by that time, she never gave up music; in 1982, she recorded a single entitled &quot;In Motion&quot; for the Sutra label in New York, and in 1986, she recorded a remake of her old hit &quot;Band of Gold&quot; with Belinda Carlisle. In 1990, she recorded three songs for Ian Levine&#x27;s UK Motorcity label: another remake of &quot;Band of Gold&quot;, &quot;Memories and Souvenirs&quot;, and &quot;Only Minutes Away&quot;. In the mid-1990s, she released three albums for Dove Music: &quot;The (Unauthorized) I Hate Barney Songbook: A Parody&quot; (1994), &quot;An Evening with Freda Payne: Live in Concert&quot; which featured her sister Scherrie Payne on background vocals, and her first (and only) Christmas album &quot;Christmas with Freda and Friends&quot;, which featured a duet between Freda and Scherrie (both 1996). She also continued her acting career appearing in the films, &quot;Private Obsession&quot; (1995), &quot;Ragdoll&quot; (1999) as the character Gran, &quot;Nutty Professor II: The Klumps&quot; (2000), and &quot;Fire &amp; Ice&quot; (made-for-TV, 2001).

===Later career===
In early 2001, Payne released a new album entitled &quot;Come See About Me&quot; for the Volt Records label (the title track is a remake of the Supremes&#x27; hit). In early 2003, she performed in a show called &quot;Love &amp; Payne&quot;, with Darlene Love at Feinstein&#x27;s at the Regency in New York, and at the Cinegrill in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, getting excellent reviews.

During the early 2000s, the following compilation albums of her music were released: &quot;Lost in Love&quot; (which includes nine of her post-Invictus recordings), &quot;Band of Gold: The Best of Freda Payne&quot; (both 2000), &quot;Unhooked Generation: The Complete Invictus Recordings&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Best of Freda Payne: Ten Best Series&quot; (2002). In late 2002, Payne appeared with many R&amp;B stars on the &quot;Rhythm, Love, and Soul&quot; edition of the PBS series American Soundtrack. Her performance of &quot;Band of Gold&quot; was included on the accompanying live album that was released in 2004. On April 22, 2009, Payne appeared on &quot;American Idol&quot; and sang &quot;Band of Gold&quot;.

In February 2010, Payne joined Kanye West, Jordin Sparks, Jennifer Hudson, Barbra Streisand and many more on We Are the World for Haiti Relief. In 2011, Payne recorded a duet, &quot;Saving A Life&quot;, with British pop star Sir Cliff Richard for inclusion on his &quot;Soulicious&quot; album. She joined Richard on his &quot;Soulicious&quot; tour of the UK in October of the same year. She sang the new duet with Richard along with her own hit &quot;Band of Gold&quot;.

In January 2018, she performed &quot;A Tribute to Ella Fitzgerald&quot;, in the Sitnik Theatre of the Lackland Performing Arts Center, in Hackettstown, New Jersey.

==Personal life and honors==
Payne was married to American singer Gregory Abbott from 1976 until 1979. Their wedding took place in Chicago. They spent their honeymoon in Acapulco, Mexico. Payne and Abbott had a son, Gregory Abbott Jr., who was born on September 19, 1977, Payne&#x27;s 35th birthday. Payne later had a relationship with American musician Edmund Sylvers (lead singer of the Sylvers) from 1979 until January 1983. Sylvers wrote and produced her 1982 single &quot;In Motion&quot;.

In 1974, she made the cover of &quot;Jet&quot; after she was 
appointed a Dame of Justice of the Order of St John of Jerusalem by the Prince of Rumania.

In 2017, Payne was inducted into the 2017 class of the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, in her hometown of Detroit.

In 2023, the Women Songwriters Hall of Fame awarded Payne a Lifetime Achievement and Legacy Award.

<text>In many team sports, defense (American spelling) or defence (Commonwealth spelling) is the action of preventing an opponent from scoring. The term may also refer to the tactics involved in defense, or a sub-team whose primary responsibility is defense. Similarly, a defense player or defender is a player who is generally charged with preventing the other team&#x27;s forwards from being able to bear down directly on their own team&#x27;s goalkeeper or goaltender. Such positions exist in association football, ice hockey, water polo and many other sports.

==By sport==
==Field sports==

===American football===

===Association football===

===Australian rules football===

==Bat-and-ball sports==

In bat-and-ball sports, the defending team is in the field, while the offensive team sends only a few players into the field to try to score at a time. These sports generally involve a member of the defense throwing the ball to a member of the offensive team, who then tries to hit it and run to various safe areas of the field to score points. Failing to hit the ball properly, or failing to reach the safe areas before the ball is used against the offensive player, can result in that player being left unable to score.

===Baseball===
Baseball is unlike most other competitive sports in that the defense is given control of the ball. Additionally, the number of players on the field at any given time is in favor of the defense which always has nine players on the field; the offense has between one and four.

Historically, each player on the team had a role both on offense and defense. Most amateur and professional leagues have adopted the designated hitter (DH) rule introduced by the American League of Major League Baseball. In leagues that use the DH, pitchers usually do not bat, and the DH bats in lieu of the pitcher and does not play a defensive position. The main league that has not adopted the DH rule is the Central League of Nippon Professional Baseball.

Each play starts with the ball in the hands of the pitcher, whose job as a member of the defense is to use his skills to somehow prevent the batter from reaching base. The pitcher throws the ball toward the catcher, who must catch the pitched ball if it is not hit by the batter. In each half-inning, the defense attempts to force three outs.

There are three basic ways in which an out can occur:
*If three strikes are recorded against the batter, 
*if a ball hit by a batter is caught by a defensive player before it hits the ground,
*if a runner who is between bases or has not reached a base to which he is forced or put out by a defensive player in possession of the ball.

If the batter manages to hit the ball, all nine defensive players become active and use the ball in attempting to prevent the batter from reaching base and runners already on base from advancing or scoring. while the offense is busy attempting to move runners around the baseball diamond toward home plate, the defense uses the ball in various ways to achieve outs.

If the defense forces three outs, their team is moved into the offensive role. The exception is if it is the ninth or an extra inning and they are ahead, in which case, the game ends and the defensive team wins.

===Cricket===
In cricket, the fielding team is the defense, while the batting team is the offense; the batting team can only put two players on the field at a time. By getting the batting team&#x27;s batsmen out before they can hit the ball to the boundary or run between the two batsmen&#x27;s grounds, the fielding team can prevent the batting team from scoring points. Players can be gotten out if they hit the ball in the air and it is caught by a defensive player before touching the ground, or if the ball hits a batsman&#x27;s wicket, either when delivered by the bowler or when the batsman is not in his ground. By getting all but one of the batting team&#x27;s players out, the fielding team ends their opponent&#x27;s scoring turn, and may begin its own scoring turn next (though it can choose not to, in the case of the follow-on).

==Water sports==
===Beach volleyball===
===Water polo===
In water polo, if an offensive player, such as the center forward, has the ball in front of the goal, and the defender cannot steal the ball, he may intentionally commit a foul. The forward then has a free throw but must pass the ball off to another offensive player, rather than making a shot at the goal. Defensive perimeter players may also intentionally cause a foul and then move toward the goal, away from their attacker, who must take a free throw. This technique, called &#x27;sloughing&#x27;, allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the center forward and possibly steal the inbound pass. The water polo referee may refrain from declaring a foul caused by a defensive player, if in his judgment this would give the advantage to the defending team. This is known as the Advantage Rule.

==Floor and court sports==
===Futsal===
==Winter sports==
===Ice skating team sports===
There are four officially established ice skating team sports worldwide, excluding their variants. This group includes: bandy, ice hockey, ringette, and rinkball.

====Ice hockey====

In ice hockey, there are normally two designated defencemen on the ice. A defenseman can be an offensive player better known for their ability to glean goals or assists rather than for their strong defensive play. These players are referred to as &quot;offensive defensemen.&quot; Alternatively, a defenseman can play a more defensive role and rarely show up on the score sheet but remain important for their defensive prowess; these players are known as &quot;stay-at-home defense&quot;. This role, however, is becoming increasingly relegated to the past, as ice hockey teams demand more active play from their defenders. There are also defensemen who are good at both; known as &quot;two-way defensemen&quot;. Defense is a team game in hockey, and when the team is not in possession of the puck (also known as &quot;puck coverage&quot;), the aim is to effectively suppress the puck pressure coming from the opponents.

====Bandy====
In bandy, the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played, either &quot;big ice&quot; bandy which has a type of field format, or rink bandy.

====Ringette====

In ringette, there are two designated defenders on the ice in any normal game situation (the team is not serving any penalties). However, due to ringette&#x27;s first-three-in rule these situations can vary; those playing in the defensive zone are not always designated defenders.

====Rinkball====

In rinkball, the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played.

===Skateless winter team sports===
There are three known organized skateless winter team sports worldwide, that are not organized forms of snowball fighting. This group includes: broomball, Spongee ( &quot;sponge hockey&quot;), and Moscow broomball.

====Broomball====

In broomball, the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played.

====Spongee====

In spongee ( &quot;sponge hockey&quot;), the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played.

====Moscow broomball====

In Moscow broomball, the number of defenders on the ice at a given time depends on the format being played.

== Tag sports ==

=== Atya patya ===
In atya patya, the defenders aim to tag players on the offensive team in order to eliminate them and prevent them from scoring.

=== Kabaddi ===
In kabaddi, the defenders aim to avoid being touched by the opposing team&#x27;s raider; if the defenders can tackle the raider or &quot;dash&quot; the raider out-of-bounds so that the raider cannot return to the other half of the field, then the defenders score 1 point.

=== Kho kho ===
In kho kho, the defenders aim to avoid being tagged. Defenders take to the field in batches of three, with tagged defenders eliminated from play, and a new batch entering the field once the entire previous batch has been dismissed.

<doc id="228102" wikidata="Q838247" url="?curid=228102" title="Defense (legal)">
<text>In a civil proceeding or criminal prosecution under the common law or under statute, a defendant may raise a defense (or defence) in an effort to avert civil liability or criminal conviction. A defense is put forward by a party to defeat a suit or action brought against the party, and may be based on legal grounds or on factual claims.

Besides contesting the accuracy of an allegation made against the defendant in the proceeding, the defendant may also make allegations against the prosecutor or plaintiff or raise a defense, arguing that, even if the allegations against the defendant are true, the defendant is nevertheless not liable. Acceptance of a defense by the court completely exonerates the defendant and not merely mitigates the liability.

The defense phase of a trial occurs after the prosecution phase, that is, after the prosecution &quot;rests&quot;. Other parts of the defense include the opening and closing arguments and the cross-examination during the prosecution phase.

Since a defense is raised by the defendant in a direct attempt to avoid what would otherwise result in liability, the defendant typically holds the burden of proof. For example, a defendant who is charged with assault may claim provocation, but they would need to prove that the plaintiff had provoked the defendant.

== Common law defenses ==
In common law, a defendant may raise any of the numerous defenses to limit or avoid liability. These include:

* Lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction of the court, such as diplomatic immunity. (In law, this is not a defense as such but an argument that the case should not be heard at all.)
* Failure to state a cause of action or other insufficiencies of pleading.
* Any of the affirmative defenses.
* Defenses conferred by statute – such as a statute of limitations or the statute of frauds.
* &quot;Ex turpi causa non oritur actio&quot; – the action against the defendant arises from an illegality.
* &quot;Volenti non fit injuria&quot; – consent by the victim or plaintiff.
* &quot;In pari delicto&quot; – both sides equally at fault.
* Act of God is an unforeseeable natural phenomenon which involves no human agency due directly to natural causes which cannot be foreseen. 
* &quot;Necessity&quot; harm done to prevent a greater evil is not actionable even though the harm was caused intentionally. 
* Mistake whether of fact or of law is no defence to action. 
* The law permits use of reasonable force to protect one&#x27;s person or property. If force is used for self-defence they will not be liable for harm.
* Unclean hands.

In addition to defenses against prosecution and liability, a defendant may also raise a defense of justification – such as self-defense and defense of others or defense of property.

In English law, one could raise the argument of a &quot;contramandatum&quot;, which was an argument that the plaintiff had no cause for complaint.

==Strategies==
The defense in a homicide case may attempt to present evidence of the victim&#x27;s character, to try to prove that the victim had a history of violence or of making threats of violence that suggest a violent character. The goal of presenting character evidence about the victim may be to make more plausible a claim of self-defense, or in the hope of accomplishing jury nullification in which a jury acquits a guilty defendant despite its belief that the defendant committed a criminal act.

== Costs ==
Litigation is expensive and often may last for months or years. Parties can finance their litigation and pay for their attorneys&#x27; fees or other legal costs in a number of ways. A defendant can pay with their own money, through legal defense funds, or legal financing companies. For example, in the United Kingdom, a defendant&#x27;s legal fees may be covered by legal aid.

<text>In continuum mechanics, stress is a physical quantity that describes forces present during deformation. For example, an object being pulled apart, such as a stretched elastic band, is subject to &quot;tensile&quot; stress and may undergo elongation. An object being pushed together, such as a crumpled sponge, is subject to &quot;compressive&quot; stress and may undergo shortening. The greater the force and the smaller the cross-sectional area of the body on which it acts, the greater the stress. Stress has dimension of force per area, with SI units of newtons per square meter (N/m2) or pascal (Pa).

Stress expresses the internal forces that neighbouring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while &quot;strain&quot; is the measure of the relative deformation of the material. For example, when a solid vertical bar is supporting an overhead weight, each particle in the bar pushes on the particles immediately below it. When a liquid is in a closed container under pressure, each particle gets pushed against by all the surrounding particles. The container walls and the pressure-inducing surface (such as a piston) push against them in (Newtonian) reaction. These macroscopic forces are actually the net result of a very large number of intermolecular forces and collisions between the particles in those molecules. Stress is frequently represented by a lowercase Greek letter sigma (&quot;σ&quot;).

Strain inside a material may arise by various mechanisms, such as &quot;stress&quot; as applied by external forces to the bulk material (like gravity) or to its surface (like contact forces, external pressure, or friction). Any strain (deformation) of a solid material generates an internal &quot;elastic stress&quot;, analogous to the reaction force of a spring, that tends to restore the material to its original non-deformed state. In liquids and gases, only deformations that change the volume generate persistent elastic stress. If the deformation changes gradually with time, even in fluids there will usually be some &quot;viscous stress&quot;, opposing that change. Elastic and viscous stresses are usually combined under the name &quot;mechanical stress&quot;.
Significant stress may exist even when deformation is negligible or non-existent (a common assumption when modeling the flow of water). Stress may exist in the absence of external forces; such &quot;built-in stress&quot; is important, for example, in prestressed concrete and tempered glass. Stress may also be imposed on a material without the application of net forces, for example by changes in temperature or chemical composition, or by external electromagnetic fields (as in piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials).

The relation between mechanical stress, strain, and the strain rate can be quite complicated, although a linear approximation may be adequate in practice if the quantities are sufficiently small. Stress that exceeds certain strength limits of the material will result in permanent deformation (such as plastic flow, fracture, cavitation) or even change its crystal structure and chemical composition.
==History==
Humans have known about stress inside materials since ancient times. Until the 17th century, this understanding was largely intuitive and empirical, though this did not prevent the development of relatively advanced technologies like the composite bow and glass blowing.

Over several millennia, architects and builders in particular, learned how to put together carefully shaped wood beams and stone blocks to withstand, transmit, and distribute stress in the most effective manner, with ingenious devices such as the capitals, arches, cupolas, trusses and the flying buttresses of Gothic cathedrals.

Ancient and medieval architects did develop some geometrical methods and simple formulas to compute the proper sizes of pillars and beams, but the scientific understanding of stress became possible only after the necessary tools were invented in the 17th and 18th centuries: Galileo Galilei&#x27;s rigorous experimental method, René Descartes&#x27;s coordinates and analytic geometry, and Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and equilibrium and calculus of infinitesimals. With those tools, Augustin-Louis Cauchy was able to give the first rigorous and general mathematical model of a deformed elastic body by introducing the notions of stress and strain. Cauchy observed that the force across an imaginary surface was a linear function of its normal vector; and, moreover, that it must be a symmetric function (with zero total momentum).
The understanding of stress in liquids started with Newton, who provided a differential formula for friction forces (shear stress) in parallel laminar flow.

== Definition ==
Stress is defined as the force across a small boundary per unit area of that boundary, for all orientations of the boundary. Derived from a physical quantity (force) and a purely geometrical quantity (area), stress is also a physical quantity, like velocity, torque or energy, that can be quantified and analyzed without explicit consideration of the nature of the material or of its physical causes.
Following the basic premises of continuum mechanics, stress is a macroscopic concept. Namely, the particles considered in its definition and analysis should be just small enough to be treated as homogeneous in composition and state, but still large enough to ignore quantum effects and the detailed motions of molecules. Thus, the force between two particles is actually the average of a very large number of atomic forces between their molecules; and physical quantities like mass, velocity, and forces that act through the bulk of three-dimensional bodies, like gravity, are assumed to be smoothly distributed over them. Depending on the context, one may also assume that the particles are large enough to allow the averaging out of other microscopic features, like the grains of a metal rod or the fibers of a piece of wood.

Quantitatively, the stress is expressed by the &quot;Cauchy traction vector&quot; &quot;T&quot; defined as the traction force &quot;F&quot; between adjacent parts of the material across an imaginary separating surface &quot;S&quot;, divided by the area of &quot;S&quot;. In a fluid at rest the force is perpendicular to the surface, and is the familiar pressure. In a solid, or in a flow of viscous liquid, the force &quot;F&quot; may not be perpendicular to &quot;S&quot;; hence the stress across a surface must be regarded a vector quantity, not a scalar. Moreover, the direction and magnitude generally depend on the orientation of &quot;S&quot;. Thus the stress state of the material must be described by a tensor, called the (Cauchy) stress tensor; which is a linear function that relates the normal vector &quot;n&quot; of a surface &quot;S&quot; to the traction vector &quot;T&quot; across &quot;S&quot;. With respect to any chosen coordinate system, the Cauchy stress tensor can be represented as a symmetric matrix of 3×3 real numbers. Even within a homogeneous body, the stress tensor may vary from place to place, and may change over time; therefore, the stress within a material is, in general, a time-varying tensor field.

=== Normal and shear ===
In general, the stress &quot;T&quot; that a particle &quot;P&quot; applies on another particle &quot;Q&quot; across a surface &quot;S&quot; can have any direction relative to &quot;S&quot;. The vector &quot;T&quot; may be regarded as the sum of two components: the &quot;normal stress&quot; (compression or tension) perpendicular to the surface, and the &quot;shear stress&quot; that is parallel to the surface.

If the normal unit vector &quot;n&quot; of the surface (pointing from &quot;Q&quot; towards &quot;P&quot;) is assumed fixed, the normal component can be expressed by a single number, the dot product . This number will be positive if &quot;P&quot; is &quot;pulling&quot; on &quot;Q&quot; (tensile stress), and negative if &quot;P&quot; is &quot;pushing&quot; against &quot;Q&quot; (compressive stress). The shear component is then the vector .

== Units ==
The dimension of stress is that of pressure, and therefore its coordinates are measured in the same units as pressure: namely, pascals (Pa, that is, newtons per square metre) in the International System, or pounds per square inch (psi) in the Imperial system. Because mechanical stresses easily exceed a million Pascals, MPa, which stands for megapascal, is a common unit of stress.

== Causes and effects ==

Stress in a material body may be due to multiple physical causes, including external influences and internal physical processes. Some of these agents (like gravity, changes in temperature and phase, and electromagnetic fields) act on the bulk of the material, varying continuously with position and time. Other agents (like external loads and friction, ambient pressure, and contact forces) may create stresses and forces that are concentrated on certain surfaces, lines or points; and possibly also on very short time intervals (as in the impulses due to collisions). In active matter, self-propulsion of microscopic particles generates macroscopic stress profiles. In general, the stress distribution in a body is expressed as a piecewise continuous function of space and time.

Conversely, stress is usually correlated with various effects on the material, possibly including changes in physical properties like birefringence, polarization, and permeability. The imposition of stress by an external agent usually creates some strain (deformation) in the material, even if it is too small to be detected. In a solid material, such strain will in turn generate an internal elastic stress, analogous to the reaction force of a stretched spring, tending to restore the material to its original undeformed state. Fluid materials (liquids, gases and plasmas) by definition can only oppose deformations that would change their volume. If the deformation changes with time, even in fluids there will usually be some viscous stress, opposing that change. Such stresses can be either shear or normal in nature. Molecular origin of shear stresses in fluids is given in the article on viscosity. The same for normal viscous stresses can be found in Sharma (2019).

The relation between stress and its effects and causes, including deformation and rate of change of deformation, can be quite complicated (although a linear approximation may be adequate in practice if the quantities are small enough). Stress that exceeds certain strength limits of the material will result in permanent deformation (such as plastic flow, fracture, cavitation) or even change its crystal structure and chemical composition.

==Simple types==

In some situations, the stress within a body may adequately be described by a single number, or by a single vector (a number and a direction). Three such simple stress situations, that are often encountered in engineering design, are the &quot;uniaxial normal stress&quot;, the &quot;simple shear stress&quot;, and the &quot;isotropic normal stress&quot;.

===Uniaxial normal===

A common situation with a simple stress pattern is when a straight rod, with uniform material and cross section, is subjected to tension by opposite forces of magnitude formula_1 along its axis. If the system is in equilibrium and not changing with time, and the weight of the bar can be neglected, then through each transversal section of the bar the top part must pull on the bottom part with the same force, &quot;F&quot; with continuity through the full cross-sectional area&quot;, A&quot;. Therefore, the stress σ throughout the bar, across any horizontal surface, can be expressed simply by the single number σ, calculated simply with the magnitude of those forces, &quot;F&quot;, and cross sectional area, &quot;A&quot;.formula_2 On the other hand, if one imagines the bar being cut along its length, parallel to the axis, there will be no force (hence no stress) between the two halves across the cut.
This type of stress may be called (simple) normal stress or uniaxial stress; specifically, (uniaxial, simple, etc.) tensile stress. If the load is compression on the bar, rather than stretching it, the analysis is the same except that the force &quot;F&quot; and the stress formula_3 change sign, and the stress is called compressive stress.
This analysis assumes the stress is evenly distributed over the entire cross-section. In practice, depending on how the bar is attached at the ends and how it was manufactured, this assumption may not be valid. In that case, the value formula_3 = &quot;F&quot;/&quot;A&quot; will be only the average stress, called &quot;engineering stress&quot; or &quot;nominal stress&quot;. If the bar&#x27;s length &quot;L&quot; is many times its diameter &quot;D&quot;, and it has no gross defects or built-in stress, then the stress can be assumed to be uniformly distributed over any cross-section that is more than a few times &quot;D&quot; from both ends. (This observation is known as the Saint-Venant&#x27;s principle).

Normal stress occurs in many other situations besides axial tension and compression. If an elastic bar with uniform and symmetric cross-section is bent in one of its planes of symmetry, the resulting &quot;bending stress&quot; will still be normal (perpendicular to the cross-section), but will vary over the cross section: the outer part will be under tensile stress, while the inner part will be compressed. Another variant of normal stress is the &quot;hoop stress&quot; that occurs on the walls of a cylindrical pipe or vessel filled with pressurized fluid.
===Shear===
Another simple type of stress occurs when a uniformly thick layer of elastic material like glue or rubber is firmly attached to two stiff bodies that are pulled in opposite directions by forces parallel to the layer; or a section of a soft metal bar that is being cut by the jaws of a scissors-like tool. Let &quot;F&quot; be the magnitude of those forces, and &quot;M&quot; be the midplane of that layer. Just as in the normal stress case, the part of the layer on one side of &quot;M&quot; must pull the other part with the same force &quot;F&quot;. Assuming that the direction of the forces is known, the stress across &quot;M&quot; can be expressed simply by the single number formula_5, calculated simply with the magnitude of those forces, &quot;F&quot; and the cross sectional area, &quot;A&quot;.formula_6Unlike normal stress, this &quot;simple shear stress&quot; is directed parallel to the cross-section considered, rather than perpendicular to it. For any plane &quot;S&quot; that is perpendicular to the layer, the net internal force across &quot;S&quot;, and hence the stress, will be zero.

As in the case of an axially loaded bar, in practice the shear stress may not be uniformly distributed over the layer; so, as before, the ratio &quot;F&quot;/&quot;A&quot; will only be an average (&quot;nominal&quot;, &quot;engineering&quot;) stress. That average is often sufficient for practical purposes. Shear stress is observed also when a cylindrical bar such as a shaft is subjected to opposite torques at its ends. In that case, the shear stress on each cross-section is parallel to the cross-section, but oriented tangentially relative to the axis, and increases with distance from the axis. Significant shear stress occurs in the middle plate (the &quot;web&quot;) of I-beams under bending loads, due to the web constraining the end plates (&quot;flanges&quot;).

=== Isotropic ===

Another simple type of stress occurs when the material body is under equal compression or tension in all directions. This is the case, for example, in a portion of liquid or gas at rest, whether enclosed in some container or as part of a larger mass of fluid; or inside a cube of elastic material that is being pressed or pulled on all six faces by equal perpendicular forces — provided, in both cases, that the material is homogeneous, without built-in stress, and that the effect of gravity and other external forces can be neglected.

In these situations, the stress across any imaginary internal surface turns out to be equal in magnitude and always directed perpendicularly to the surface independently of the surface&#x27;s orientation. This type of stress may be called &quot;isotropic normal&quot; or just &quot;isotropic&quot;; if it is compressive, it is called &quot;hydrostatic pressure&quot; or just &quot;pressure&quot;. Gases by definition cannot withstand tensile stresses, but some liquids may withstand very large amounts of isotropic tensile stress under some circumstances. see Z-tube.

=== Cylinder ===
Parts with rotational symmetry, such as wheels, axles, pipes, and pillars, are very common in engineering. Often the stress patterns that occur in such parts have rotational or even cylindrical symmetry. The analysis of such cylinder stresses can take advantage of the symmetry to reduce the dimension of the domain and/or of the stress tensor.

== General types ==
Often, mechanical bodies experience more than one type of stress at the same time; this is called &quot;combined stress&quot;. In normal and shear stress, the magnitude of the stress is maximum for surfaces that are perpendicular to a certain direction formula_7, and zero across any surfaces that are parallel to formula_7. When the shear stress is zero only across surfaces that are perpendicular to one particular direction, the stress is called &quot;biaxial&quot;, and can be viewed as the sum of two normal or shear stresses. In the most general case, called &quot;triaxial stress&quot;, the stress is nonzero across every surface element.

== Cauchy tensor ==

Combined stresses cannot be described by a single vector. Even if the material is stressed in the same way throughout the volume of the body, the stress across any imaginary surface will depend on the orientation of that surface, in a non-trivial way.

Cauchy observed that the stress vector formula_9 across a surface will always be a linear function of the surface&#x27;s normal vector formula_10, the unit-length vector that is perpendicular to it. That is, formula_11, where the function formula_12 satisfies
formula_13
for any vectors formula_14 and any real numbers formula_15.
The function formula_12, now called the (Cauchy) stress tensor, completely describes the stress state of a uniformly stressed body. (Today, any linear connection between two physical vector quantities is called a tensor, reflecting Cauchy&#x27;s original use to describe the &quot;tensions&quot; (stresses) in a material.) In tensor calculus, formula_12 is classified as a second-order tensor of type (0,2) or (1,1) depending on convention.

Like any linear map between vectors, the stress tensor can be represented in any chosen Cartesian coordinate system by a 3×3 matrix of real numbers. Depending on whether the coordinates are numbered formula_18 or named formula_19, the matrix may be written as
formula_20 or formula_21
The stress vector formula_11 across a surface with normal vector formula_10 (which is covariant - &quot;row; horizontal&quot; - vector) with coordinates formula_24 is then a matrix product formula_25 (where T in upper index is transposition, and as a result we get covariant (row) vector) (look on Cauchy stress tensor), that is
formula_26

The linear relation between formula_9 and formula_10 follows from the fundamental laws of conservation of linear momentum and static equilibrium of forces, and is therefore mathematically exact, for any material and any stress situation. The components of the Cauchy stress tensor at every point in a material satisfy the equilibrium equations (Cauchy&#x27;s equations of motion for zero acceleration). Moreover, the principle of conservation of angular momentum implies that the stress tensor is symmetric, that is formula_29, formula_30, and formula_31. Therefore, the stress state of the medium at any point and instant can be specified by only six independent parameters, rather than nine. These may be written
formula_32
where the elements formula_33 are called the &quot;orthogonal normal stresses&quot; (relative to the chosen coordinate system), and formula_34 the &quot;orthogonal shear stresses&quot;.

===Change of coordinates===

The Cauchy stress tensor obeys the tensor transformation law under a change in the system of coordinates. A graphical representation of this transformation law is the Mohr&#x27;s circle of stress distribution.

As a symmetric 3×3 real matrix, the stress tensor formula_12 has three mutually orthogonal unit-length eigenvectors formula_36 and three real eigenvalues formula_37, such that formula_38. Therefore, in a coordinate system with axes formula_36, the stress tensor is a diagonal matrix, and has only the three normal components formula_40 the principal stresses. If the three eigenvalues are equal, the stress is an isotropic compression or tension, always perpendicular to any surface, there is no shear stress, and the tensor is a diagonal matrix in any coordinate frame.

===Tensor field===
In general, stress is not uniformly distributed over a material body, and may vary with time. Therefore, the stress tensor must be defined for each point and each moment, by considering an infinitesimal particle of the medium surrounding that point, and taking the average stresses in that particle as being the stresses at the point.
=== Thin plates ===

Human-made objects are often made from stock plates of various materials by operations that do not change their essentially two-dimensional character, like cutting, drilling, gentle bending and welding along the edges. The description of stress in such bodies can be simplified by modeling those parts as two-dimensional surfaces rather than three-dimensional bodies.

In that view, one redefines a &quot;particle&quot; as being an infinitesimal patch of the plate&#x27;s surface, so that the boundary between adjacent particles becomes an infinitesimal line element; both are implicitly extended in the third dimension, normal to (straight through) the plate. &quot;Stress&quot; is then redefined as being a measure of the internal forces between two adjacent &quot;particles&quot; across their common line element, divided by the length of that line. Some components of the stress tensor can be ignored, but since particles are not infinitesimal in the third dimension one can no longer ignore the torque that a particle applies on its neighbors. That torque is modeled as a &quot;bending stress&quot; that tends to change the curvature of the plate. These simplifications may not hold at welds, at sharp bends and creases (where the radius of curvature is comparable to the thickness of the plate).

=== Thin beams ===

The analysis of stress can be considerably simplified also for thin bars, beams or wires of uniform (or smoothly varying) composition and cross-section that are subjected to moderate bending and twisting. For those bodies, one may consider only cross-sections that are perpendicular to the bar&#x27;s axis, and redefine a &quot;particle&quot; as being a piece of wire with infinitesimal length between two such cross sections. The ordinary stress is then reduced to a scalar (tension or compression of the bar), but one must take into account also a &quot;bending stress&quot; (that tries to change the bar&#x27;s curvature, in some direction perpendicular to the axis) and a &quot;torsional stress&quot; (that tries to twist or un-twist it about its axis).

== Analysis ==
Stress analysis is a branch of applied physics that covers the determination of the internal distribution of internal forces in solid objects. It is an essential tool in engineering for the study and design of structures such as tunnels, dams, mechanical parts, and structural frames, under prescribed or expected loads. It is also important in many other disciplines; for example, in geology, to study phenomena like plate tectonics, vulcanism and avalanches; and in biology, to understand the anatomy of living beings.
=== Goals and assumptions ===
Stress analysis is generally concerned with objects and structures that can be assumed to be in macroscopic static equilibrium. By Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, any external forces being applied to such a system must be balanced by internal reaction forces, which are almost always surface contact forces between adjacent particles — that is, as stress. Since every particle needs to be in equilibrium, this reaction stress will generally propagate from particle to particle, creating a stress distribution throughout the body.
The typical problem in stress analysis is to determine these internal stresses, given the external forces that are acting on the system. The latter may be body forces (such as gravity or magnetic attraction), that act throughout the volume of a material; or concentrated loads (such as friction between an axle and a bearing, or the weight of a train wheel on a rail), that are imagined to act over a two-dimensional area, or along a line, or at single point.

In stress analysis one normally disregards the physical causes of the forces or the precise nature of the materials. Instead, one assumes that the stresses are related to deformation (and, in non-static problems, to the rate of deformation) of the material by known constitutive equations.

=== Methods ===
Stress analysis may be carried out experimentally, by applying loads to the actual artifact or to scale model, and measuring the resulting stresses, by any of several available methods. This approach is often used for safety certification and monitoring. Most stress is analysed by mathematical methods, especially during design.
The basic stress analysis problem can be formulated by Euler&#x27;s equations of motion for continuous bodies (which are consequences of Newton&#x27;s laws for conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum) and the Euler-Cauchy stress principle, together with the appropriate constitutive equations. Thus one obtains a system of partial differential equations involving the stress tensor field and the strain tensor field, as unknown functions to be determined. The external body forces appear as the independent (&quot;right-hand side&quot;) term in the differential equations, while the concentrated forces appear as boundary conditions. The basic stress analysis problem is therefore a boundary-value problem.

Stress analysis for elastic structures is based on the theory of elasticity and infinitesimal strain theory. When the applied loads cause permanent deformation, one must use more complicated constitutive equations, that can account for the physical processes involved (plastic flow, fracture, phase change, etc.). Engineered structures are usually designed so the maximum expected stresses are well within the range of linear elasticity (the generalization of Hooke&#x27;s law for continuous media); that is, the deformations caused by internal stresses are linearly related to them. In this case the differential equations that define the stress tensor are linear, and the problem becomes much easier. For one thing, the stress at any point will be a linear function of the loads, too. For small enough stresses, even non-linear systems can usually be assumed to be linear.
Stress analysis is simplified when the physical dimensions and the distribution of loads allow the structure to be treated as one- or two-dimensional. In the analysis of trusses, for example, the stress field may be assumed to be uniform and uniaxial over each member. Then the differential equations reduce to a finite set of equations (usually linear) with finitely many unknowns. In other contexts one may be able to reduce the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional one, and/or replace the general stress and strain tensors by simpler models like uniaxial tension/compression, simple shear, etc.

Still, for two- or three-dimensional cases one must solve a partial differential equation problem.
Analytical or closed-form solutions to the differential equations can be obtained when the geometry, constitutive relations, and boundary conditions are simple enough. Otherwise one must generally resort to numerical approximations such as the finite element method, the finite difference method, and the boundary element method.

<doc id="228108" wikidata="Q2091584" url="?curid=228108" title="Young's modulus">
<text>Young&#x27;s modulus (or Young modulus) is a mechanical property of solid materials that measures the tensile or compressive stiffness when the force is applied lengthwise. It is the modulus of elasticity for tension or axial compression. Young&#x27;s modulus is defined as the ratio of the stress (force per unit area) applied to the object and the resulting axial strain (displacement or deformation) in the linear elastic region of the material.

Although Young&#x27;s modulus is named after the 19th-century British scientist Thomas Young, the concept was developed in 1727 by Leonhard Euler. The first experiments that used the concept of Young&#x27;s modulus in its modern form were performed by the Italian scientist Giordano Riccati in 1782, pre-dating Young&#x27;s work by 25 years. The term modulus is derived from the Latin root term &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;measure&quot;.

==Definition==
Young&#x27;s modulus, formula_1, quantifies the relationship between tensile or compressive stress formula_2 (force per unit area) and axial strain formula_3 (proportional deformation) in the linear elastic region of a material:
formula_4

Young&#x27;s modulus is commonly measured in the International System of Units (SI) in multiples of the pascal (Pa) and common values are in the range of gigapascals (GPa).

Examples:
* Rubber (increasing pressure: &quot;length increases quickly, meaning low formula_1&quot;)
* Aluminium (increasing pressure: &quot;length increases slowly, meaning high formula_1&quot;)

===Linear elasticity===

A solid material undergoes elastic deformation when a small load is applied to it in compression or extension. Elastic deformation is reversible, meaning that the material returns to its original shape after the load is removed.

At near-zero stress and strain, the stress–strain curve is linear, and the relationship between stress and strain is described by Hooke&#x27;s law that states stress is proportional to strain. The coefficient of proportionality is Young&#x27;s modulus. The higher the modulus, the more stress is needed to create the same amount of strain; an idealized rigid body would have an infinite Young&#x27;s modulus. Conversely, a very soft material (such as a fluid) would deform without force, and would have zero Young&#x27;s modulus.

===Related but distinct properties===
Material stiffness is a distinct property from the following:
* Strength: maximum amount of stress that material can withstand while staying in the elastic (reversible) deformation regime;
* Geometric stiffness: a global characteristic of the body that depends on its shape, and not only on the local properties of the material; for instance, an I-beam has a higher bending stiffness than a rod of the same material for a given mass per length;
* Hardness: relative resistance of the material&#x27;s surface to penetration by a harder body;
* Toughness: amount of energy that a material can absorb before fracture.
*The point E is the elastic limit or the yield point of the material within which the stress is proportional to strain and the material regains its original shape after removal of the external force.

==Usage==
Young&#x27;s modulus enables the calculation of the change in the dimension of a bar made of an isotropic elastic material under tensile or compressive loads. For instance, it predicts how much a material sample extends under tension or shortens under compression. The Young&#x27;s modulus directly applies to cases of uniaxial stress; that is, tensile or compressive stress in one direction and no stress in the other directions. Young&#x27;s modulus is also used in order to predict the deflection that will occur in a statically determinate beam when a load is applied at a point in between the beam&#x27;s supports.

Other elastic calculations usually require the use of one additional elastic property, such as the shear modulus formula_7, bulk modulus formula_8, and Poisson&#x27;s ratio formula_9. Any two of these parameters are sufficient to fully describe elasticity in an isotropic material. For example, calculating physical properties of cancerous skin tissue, has been measured and found to be a Poisson’s ratio of 0.43±0.12 and an average Young’s modulus of 52 KPa. Defining the elastic properties of skin may become the first step in turning elasticity into a clinical tool. For homogeneous isotropic materials simple relations exist between elastic constants that allow calculating them all as long as two are known:
:formula_10

===Linear versus non-linear===
Young&#x27;s modulus represents the factor of proportionality in Hooke&#x27;s law, which relates the stress and the strain. However, Hooke&#x27;s law is only valid under the assumption of an &quot;elastic&quot; and &quot;linear&quot; response. Any real material will eventually fail and break when stretched over a very large distance or with a very large force; however, all solid materials exhibit nearly Hookean behavior for small enough strains or stresses. If the range over which Hooke&#x27;s law is valid is large enough compared to the typical stress that one expects to apply to the material, the material is said to be linear. Otherwise (if the typical stress one would apply is outside the linear range), the material is said to be non-linear.

Steel, carbon fiber and glass among others are usually considered linear materials, while other materials such as rubber and soils are non-linear. However, this is not an absolute classification: if very small stresses or strains are applied to a non-linear material, the response will be linear, but if very high stress or strain is applied to a linear material, the linear theory will not be enough. For example, as the linear theory implies reversibility, it would be absurd to use the linear theory to describe the failure of a steel bridge under a high load; although steel is a linear material for most applications, it is not in such a case of catastrophic failure.

In solid mechanics, the slope of the stress–strain curve at any point is called the tangent modulus. It can be experimentally determined from the slope of a stress–strain curve created during tensile tests conducted on a sample of the material.

===Directional materials===
Young&#x27;s modulus is not always the same in all orientations of a material. Most metals and ceramics, along with many other materials, are isotropic, and their mechanical properties are the same in all orientations. However, metals and ceramics can be treated with certain impurities, and metals can be mechanically worked to make their grain structures directional. These materials then become anisotropic, and Young&#x27;s modulus will change depending on the direction of the force vector. Anisotropy can be seen in many composites as well. For example, carbon fiber has a much higher Young&#x27;s modulus (is much stiffer) when force is loaded parallel to the fibers (along the grain). Other such materials include wood and reinforced concrete. Engineers can use this directional phenomenon to their advantage in creating structures.

===Temperature dependence===
The Young&#x27;s modulus of metals varies with the temperature and can be realized through the change in the interatomic bonding of the atoms, and hence its change is found to be dependent on the change in the work function of the metal. Although classically, this change is predicted through fitting and without a clear underlying mechanism (for example, the Watchman&#x27;s formula), the Rahemi-Li model demonstrates how the change in the electron work function leads to change in the Young&#x27;s modulus of metals and predicts this variation with calculable parameters, using the generalization of the Lennard-Jones potential to solids. In general, as the temperature increases, the Young&#x27;s modulus decreases via formula_11 where the electron work function varies with the temperature as formula_12 and formula_13 is a calculable material property which is dependent on the crystal structure (for example, BCC, FCC). formula_14 is the electron work function at T=0 and formula_15 is constant throughout the change.

==Calculation==
Young&#x27;s modulus is calculated by dividing the tensile stress, formula_16, by the engineering extensional strain, formula_3, in the elastic (initial, linear) portion of the physical stress–strain curve:

formula_18
where
* formula_1 is the Young&#x27;s modulus (modulus of elasticity);
* formula_20 is the force exerted on an object under tension;
* formula_21 is the actual cross-sectional area, which equals the area of the cross-section perpendicular to the applied force;
* formula_22 is the amount by which the length of the object changes (formula_22 is positive if the material is stretched, and negative when the material is compressed);
* formula_24 is the original length of the object.

===Force exerted by stretched or contracted material===
Young&#x27;s modulus of a material can be used to calculate the force it exerts under specific strain.

:formula_25
where formula_20 is the force exerted by the material when contracted or stretched by formula_22.

Hooke&#x27;s law for a stretched wire can be derived from this formula:
:formula_28
where it comes in saturation
:formula_29 and formula_30

Note that the elasticity of coiled springs comes from shear modulus, not Young&#x27;s modulus. When a spring is stretched, its wire&#x27;s length doesn&#x27;t change, but its shape does. This is why only the shear modulus of elasticity is involved in the stretching of a spring. 

===Elastic potential energy===
The elastic potential energy stored in a linear elastic material is given by the integral of the Hooke&#x27;s law:

:formula_31

now by explicating the intensive variables:

:formula_32

This means that the elastic potential energy density (that is, per unit volume) is given by:
:formula_33

or, in simple notation, for a linear elastic material: formula_34, since the strain is defined formula_35.

In a nonlinear elastic material the Young&#x27;s modulus is a function of the strain, so the second equivalence no longer holds, and the elastic energy is not a quadratic function of the strain:

: formula_36

==Examples==
Young&#x27;s modulus can vary somewhat due to differences in sample composition and test method. The rate of deformation has the greatest impact on the data collected, especially in polymers. The values here are approximate and only meant for relative comparison.

<text>Antonio José de Sucre y Alcalá (; 3 February 1795 – 4 June 1830), known as the &quot;Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho&quot; (), was a Venezuelan general and politician who served as the president of Bolivia from 1825 to 1828. A close friend and associate of Simón Bolívar, he was one of the primary leaders of South America&#x27;s struggle for independence from the Spanish Empire.

Born to an aristocratic family in Cumaná, Sucre joined the revolt against Spanish rule in 1814 and quickly established himself as a highly capable military leader. In 1822, he led the Patriot forces to triumph at the Battle of Pichincha and liberated Quito, from which modern Ecuador would eventually emerge. As Bolívar&#x27;s chief lieutenant, he went on to score a decisive victory over the Spanish Royalist army at the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824, which effectively secured the independence of Peru. Afterwards he moved into Upper Peru, pacified the Royalist resistance and set up an administration on Bolívar&#x27;s orders. The region achieved independence as the Bolivia, and Sucre was inaugurated as president of the new republic after Bolívar passed on the duty.

Sucre&#x27;s tenure as president was beset by difficulties, and opposition to his rule mounted as the populace turned against Bolívar and his followers. He was forced to resign in 1828, but was recalled to military duty on the outbreak of the Gran Colombia–Peru War, in which he commanded Colombian forces and fought the Peruvian invaders to a standstill. He was assassinated in Berruecos, Colombia in 1830, and the identity of the conspirators remains a subject of historical speculation.

==Family==
The aristocratic Sucre family traces its roots back to origins in Flanders. It arrived in Venezuela through Charles de Sucre y Franco Perez, a Flemish nobleman, son of Charles Adrian de Sucre, Marquess of Peru and Buenaventura Carolina Isabel Garrido y Pardo, a Spanish noblewoman. Charles de Sucre y Pardo served as a soldier in Catalonia in 1698 and was later named Governor of Cartagena de Indias and Captain General of Cuba. On 22 December 1779, Charles de Sucre y Pardo arrived in Cumaná, Venezuela, having been named Governor of New Andalucia, which includes present-day Sucre State.

==Military career==
In 1814, Antonio José de Sucre joined the fight for South American independence from Spain. The Battle of Pichincha took place on 24 May 1822, on the slopes of the Pichincha volcano, near Quito in what is now Ecuador. The encounter, fought in the context of the Spanish American wars of independence, pitted a Patriot army under Sucre against a Royalist army commanded by Field Marshal Melchor Aymerich. The defeat of the Royalist forces brought about the liberation of Quito and secured the independence of the provinces belonging to the &quot;Real Audiencia de Quito&quot;, or &quot;Presidencia de Quito&quot;, the Spanish colonial administrative jurisdiction from which the Republic of Ecuador would eventually emerge.

As of late 1824, Royalists still had control of most of southern Peru as well as Real Felipe Fort in the port of Callao. On 9 December 1824, the Battle of Ayacucho took place at Pampa de La Quinua, near the town of Quinua, between Royalist and Patriot forces. Sucre, as Simón Bolívar&#x27;s lieutenant, led the Patriot forces to victory over the Viceroy José de la Serna, who was wounded. After the battle, second commander-in-chief José de Canterac signed the final capitulation of the Royalist army on his behalf. As a result, he was promoted, at the request of the Peruvian Congress, to Marshal and as General in Chief by the Colombian legislature.
After the victory at Ayacucho, following precise orders from Bolívar, Sucre, nominated as Ayacucho&#x27;s Grand Marshal, entered Upper Peru (known today as Bolivia) territory on 25 February 1825. Besides having orders of installing an immediately independent administration, his role was limited to giving an appearance of legality to the process that Upper Peruvians themselves had begun already.

Royalist general Pedro Antonio Olañeta stayed in Potosí, where he received by January the &quot;Union&quot; Infantry Battalion coming from Puno under the command of colonel José María Valdez. Olañeta then summoned a War Council, which agreed to continue the resistance in the name of Ferdinand VII. Next, Olañeta distributed his troops between Cotagaita fortress with the &quot;Chichas&quot; Battalion. in charge of colonel Medinacelli, while Valdez was sent to Chuquisaca with the &quot;Union&quot; Infantry Battalion and loyalist militias, and Olañeta himself marched toward Vitichi, with 60,000 pieces of gold from the Coin House in Potosí. But for the Spanish military personnel in Upper Peru, it was too little too late, as since 1821 all out guerilla warfare had raged in this part of the continent.

However, in Cochabamba the First Battalion of the Infantry Regiment &quot;Ferdinand VII&quot;, led by colonel José Martínez, rebelled and sided with the independence movement, only to be followed later by the Second Battalion, &quot;Ferdinand VII&quot; Infantry Regiment in Vallegrande, resulting in the forced resignation of Brigadier Francisco Aguilera on 12 February. Royalist colonel José Manuel Mercado occupied Santa Cruz de la Sierra on 14 February, as Chayanta stayed in the hands of lieutenant colonel Pedro Arraya, with the cavalry squadrons &quot;Santa Victoria&quot; (Holy Victory) and &quot;Dragones Americanos&quot; (American Dragoons), and in Chuquisaca the cavalry squadron &quot;Dragones de la Frontera&quot;(Frontier Dragoons) under colonel Francisco López claimed victory for the independence forces on 22 February. At this point, the majority of royalist troops of Upper Peru refused to continue fighting against the powerful army of Sucre and switched allegiances. Colonel Medinacelli with 300 soldiers also revolted against Olañeta, and on 2 April 1825 they faced each other in the Battle of Tumusla, which ended with the death of Olañeta. A few days later, on 7 April, general José Mario Valdez surrendered in Chequelte to general Urdininea, putting an end to the war in Upper Peru and signalling victory to the local independence movement which had been active since 1811.

== Role in the foundation of Bolivia ==


After the Constituent Assembly in Chuquisaca was reconvened by Marshal Sucre on 8 July 1825 and later concluded, it was determined the complete independence of Upper Peru under the republican form. Finally, the Assembly president José Mariano Serrano, together with a commission, wrote down the &quot;Independence Act of the Upper Peruvian Departments&quot; which carries the date of 6 August 1825, in honor of the Battle of Junín won by Bolívar. Independence was declared by 7 representatives from Charcas, 14 from Potosí, 12 from La Paz, 13 from Cochabamba and 2 from Santa Cruz. The act of Independence, wrote by the president of the Congress, Serrano, states in its expositive part:

Through a decree it was determined that the new state in Upper Peru would carry the name of &quot;República Bolívar&quot;, in honor of the liberator, who was designated as &quot;Father of the Republic and Supreme Chief of State&quot;. Bolívar thanked them for these honors, but declined the presidency of the Republic, a duty he gave instead to the victor of Ayacucho, Grand Marshal Sucre, who would later be sworn in the same day as the first President of Bolivia. After some time, the subject of the name of the Young nation arose again, and a Potosían deputy named Manuel Martín Cruz offered a solution, suggesting that in the same manner which from Romulus comes Rome, from Bolívar ought to come the new nation of Bolivia.

When Bolívar got the news of the decision, he felt flattered by the young nation, but until then he had not willingly accepted Upper Peru&#x27;s independence because he was worried about its future, due to Bolivia&#x27;s location in the center of South America. According to Bolívar, this would create a nation that would face many future wars. Bolívar wished that Bolivia would become part of another nation, preferably Peru (given the fact that it had been part of Viceroyalty of Peru for centuries), or Argentina (since during the last decades of colonial domain it had been part of Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata), but what deeply convinced him otherwise was the attitude of the people. On 18 August, upon his arrival to La Paz, there was a demonstration of popular rejoicing. The same scene repeated when the Liberator arrived to Oruro, then to Potosí and finally to Chuquisaca, where he met his lieutenant of many years once more. Such a fervent demonstration by the people touched Bolívar, who called the new nation his &quot;Predilect Daughter&quot; and was called by the peoples of the new republic their &quot;Favorite Son.&quot;

After the foundation of Bolivia, he became also the commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Bolivia, which he created the following day on the basis of the guerrilla forces and active Patriot armies stationed at the time of the declaration. He gave the young republic its first Constitution in 1828.

== Battle of Tarqui ==

In the Battle of Tarqui, fought on 27 February 1829, heavily outnumbered two to one, Sucre defeated a Peruvian invasion force led by third President and General of Peru José de La Mar, whose intentions had been to annex Guayaquil and the rest of Ecuador to Peru.

==Post-independence==
When a strong movement arose against Bolívar, his followers, and the Bolivian constitution in 1828, Sucre resigned.

==Death==
Sucre was killed on 4 June 1830. General Juan José Flores wanted to separate the southern departments (Quito, Guayaquil, and Azuay), called the District of Ecuador, from the Gran Colombia so as to form an independent country and become its first President. General Flores believed that if Antonio José de Sucre arrived in Quito from Bogotá, he could thwart his plans, since Sucre was very popular due to his reputation as a hero and leader in the Battles of Pichincha, Tarqui and Ayacucho. General Juan José Flores put himself in contact with the anti-Bolívar and anti-Sucre leader Brigadier-General and the Commanding General of Cauca, José María Obando, who was not present at Sucre&#x27;s death but who delegated this criminal act to the Venezuelan Colonel Apolinar Morillo, Commander Juan Gregorio Sarria (who later confessed he had been paid by Obando), José Erazo (a highway bandit and guerrilla fighter), and three peons as accomplices. The plan was to ambush José Antonio de Sucre on the morning of June 4, 1830, in the cold and bleak forested district of Berruecos, along a narrow path that was perennially covered with fog.

The five assassins were hiding behind trees along the part of the trail known as La Jacoba waiting for Sucre&#x27;s party, which would be passing the area single file. Sucre&#x27;s retinue comprised seven persons: two muleteers with the baggage, two sergeants, one being the Marshal&#x27;s orderly, a representative to the Congress from Cuenca, and his servant, and finally Sucre himself. When Sucre approached La Jacoba, he was struck by three bullets, two inflicting superficial wounds to his head and one piercing his heart. He fell from his horse, which had been shot in the neck, and died almost instantly. His body remained there for twenty-four hours, as his companions, fearful of a similar fate, had fled in panic.

Later, Juan Gregorio Sarria and Colonel Apolinar Morillo confessed that it was Obando who had convinced them to assassinate Sucre. Commander Juan Gregorio Sarria also confessed that Obando had paid him to kill Sucre, since there were anti-Bolívar politicians and officers in Bogotá that wanted to see both Bolívar and Sucre eliminated. The ringleader of the anti-Bolívar faction in Bogotá was Francisco de Paula Santander, who had previously given a military position to Obando and remained his associate. Santander has also been implicated (without direct proof) as a conspirator in the attempt to assassinate Bolívar on September 25, 1828. Following a quick military trial in which he was sentenced to death, Santander was granted leniency via the Council of Ministers, and despite having reservations Bolívar commuted Santander&#x27;s sentence and exiled him instead until his return to New Granada in 1832. The three peons who were part of the Sucre assassination party were poisoned by Apolinar Morillo to prevent them from testifying about Sucre&#x27;s murder. In the end, Colonel Apolinar Morillo was convicted and shot in the main square of Bogotá for the murder of Sucre on 30 November 1842, and José Erazo died in prison that same year. José Maria Obando was granted immunity due to the fact that he was too powerful in the Cauca Department.

===Burial and aftermath===

The following day Sucre&#x27;s orderly, a sergeant named Lorenzo Caicedo, with some help from others, buried the body and marked the makeshift grave with a cross formed of branches. When the widow received news of the assassination, she promptly brought Sucre&#x27;s remains from Berruecos to Quito, where they were interred in secret in the oratory of the chapel of &quot;El Dean&quot; on one of her haciendas. Subsequently, she had the remains transferred, also in secret, to the Carmen Bajo Convent in Quito, where they were placed facing the main altar of the church. Seventy years later, in April 1900, Sucre&#x27;s remains were discovered and, their authenticity scrupulously verified, transferred to the Quito Cathedral on 4 June 1900, in a sumptuous parade led by the Executive and his Ministers, the high dignitaries of the Church, and the diplomatic corps. At the time, the government ordered the building of a crypt, but it was not inaugurated until thirty-two years later, on 4 August 1932. This mausoleum consisted of a nine-ton monolith of granite from the quarries of the Pichincha volcano. Its cover, on which a cross is carved in high relief, was so heavy that thirty persons were required to move it into place.

According to the 19 December 1830 &quot;Gaceta de Colombia&quot;, Issue No. 495, a power-hungry, ambitious General Obando paid an assassin to kill Sucre by falsely informing the assassin that Sucre was a traitor and had to be stopped because Sucre&#x27;s intentions were to go to Quito and separate the Department of Cauca and the three southern departments of Colombia and unite them with Peru. In reality, Sucre, a protégé of Bolívar, was going to Quito to stop the separation of the District of Ecuador from the Gran Colombia and to retire as soon as possible in Quito to live a quiet life with his wife. Some have argued that Sucre was ordered assassinated by General Obando so as to leave no clear successor to Bolívar in the Gran Colombia. Before his death, Bolívar believed Sucre to be the only man who could have reunited the Gran Colombia; however, Bolívar&#x27;s generals and the majority of the politicians running the separate departments of the Gran Colombia had other selfish and ambitious plans. Sucre represented, according to historian Tomás Polanco Alcántara, &quot;the indispensable complement to Simón Bolívar&quot;. Upon hearing the news of Sucre&#x27;s death, Bolívar said, &quot;Se ha derramado, Dios excelso, la sangre del inocente Abel...&quot; (&quot;The blood of the innocent Abel has been spilled, oh, Most High God...&quot;). Bolívar later wrote (&quot;Gaceta de Colombia&quot;, 4 July 1830):

Sucre is buried in the Cathedral of Quito, Ecuador, as he had said, &quot;I want my bones to be forever in Quito&quot;, where his wife, Mariana de Carcelén y Larrea, Marquise of Solanda, was from.

<doc id="228115" wikidata="Q1095126" url="?curid=228115" title="Neckerchief">
<text>A neckerchief (from &quot;neck&quot; (n.) + &quot;kerchief&quot;), sometimes called a necker, kerchief or scarf, is a type of neckwear associated with those working or living outdoors, including farm labourers, cowboys and sailors. It is most commonly still seen today in the Scouts, Girl Guides and other similar youth movements. A neckerchief consists of a triangular piece of cloth or a rectangular piece folded into a triangle. The long edge is rolled towards the point, leaving a portion unrolled. The neckerchief is then fastened around the neck with the ends either tied or clasped with a slide or woggle.

==Naval==

Neckerchiefs worn by sailors are shaped like a square, and are folded in half diagonally before rolling, with rolling occurring from the tip of the resulting triangle to its hypotenuse. Either neckerchief is then placed on the wearer&#x27;s back, under or over the shirt collar with the ends at the front of the wearer. The rolled ends then pass around the neck until they meet in front of it, where they are secured together, either with a knot, such as a reef knot or a slip knot, or with a rubber band or other fastener (called a &quot;woggle&quot; or &quot;neckerchief slide&quot;) and allowed to hang. A slip knot (vs. a simple reef or square knot) will give way if the neckerchief gets caught and is thus less likely to choke the wearer.

Sailors in the United States Navy have worn a rolled black neckerchief since the American Civil War. It is currently part of the men&#x27;s service dress uniform for junior enlisted sailors as well as the women&#x27;s summer dress uniform.
==Scouting==

The Scouting movement makes the neckerchief part of its uniform. A generally ceremonial item, the neckerchief is taught to be a practical wilderness item in the Scouting tradition. The neckerchief, unrolled, is designed to be the perfect size for use as a triangular bandage for first aid.

The origin of the Scouting neckerchief seems to be in Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s participation in the Second Matabele War in 1896; where he worked with Frederick Russell Burnham, an American-born scout employed by the British Army. Baden-Powell copied Burnham&#x27;s practical style of dress, including &quot;a grey-coloured handkerchief, loosely tied around the neck to prevent sunburn&quot;. When Baden-Powell launched the Scout Movement with the book &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; in 1908, he prescribed a neckerchief or scarf as part of the Scout uniform, which he stated was &quot;very like the uniform worn by my men when I commanded the South African Constabulary&quot;. He continued; &quot;Every Troop has its own scarf colour, since the honour of your Troop is bound up in the scarf, you must be very careful to keep it tidy and clean.&quot; Initially, Scout neckerchiefs were tied with a variety of knots, but the use of a &quot;woggle&quot; or slide, originated in the United States in the early 1920s and quickly spread around the Scouting world.

Each Scout group would have a neckerchief of different design and colours. In most countries each Scout Troop uses its own colour neckerchief. The colours are usually the &quot;Troop Colours&quot; which may have a particular historical significance to the troop or to the local community.

At Scouting camps and jamborees these neckerchiefs represent units, subcamps or the camp as a whole. Fun scarves are also used as memorabilia at Scout events and country scarves are often traded at international gatherings

In Canada, while most groups use colour neckerchiefs, there is also an optional alternate universal pattern tartan neckerchief: white plaid on red for Scouts, gold plaid on dark green for Cubs. Alternating thick and thin lines of the plaid spell out &quot;CANADA&quot; in Morse code.

In Australia, Queensland uses a single maroon necker for the whole state, while the other states allow groups, Venturer Units and Rover Crews to choose their own necker. Region and Branch Teams also have their own neckers.

In Hungary, as well as the Hungarian diaspora communities in countries such as the US, the necktie color is national rather than distinctive for each troop, being light blue for ages 10 and younger and grass green for ages 11 and up.

In other countries individual patrols are identifiable by their neckerchiefs and so troops may have many different neckerchiefs all at once. In both of these cases the neckerchief and its colours are an issue of identity, and become emblematic of a troop or a patrol.

Neckerchiefs can also have important ceremonial functions in Scouting, for example, the 1st Gilwell Scout Group present a special neckerchief on completion of the Wood Badge.

Some Traditional Scouting Associations use a square neckerchief folded over, as Scouts originally wore.

==Political youth movements==

In Nazi Germany, the Hitler Jugend, Deutsches Jungvolk and Bund Deutscher Mädel all wore a black neckerchief as part of their uniform, usually folded under the shirt collar. It has been suggested that it was copied from Scouting, which was banned in Germany in 1935.

In many Communist states, members of the Pioneer movement wore a red neckerchief which was sometimes worn without the rest of the uniform. This continues at present in China, Vietnam, and North Korea.

<doc id="228125" wikidata="Q7740892" url="?curid=228125" title="The Human Zoo (radio)">
<text>The Human Zoo, was a radio program that was presented by Tommy Boyd, with his engineer Asher Gould acting as co-presenter. It was broadcast from May 2000 until Boyd&#x27;s dismissal in March 2002. The program was named after the 1969 book by Desmond Morris.

== Format ==
The program adopted a &#x27;phone-in&#x27; format where callers were not pre-screened and could freely discuss topics within broadcasting regulations. 

To ensure compliance, a dump button was utilized, a common method in radio to prevent the broadcast of offensive or illegal content. The station&#x27;s output was delayed slightly, enabling the station to silence any unwanted remarks from callers before they aired. The Human Zoo welcomed a diverse range of callers, some of whom contributed short performances, played prepared audio pieces, or simply shared catchphrases.

== Demise ==
Boyd was dismissed from Talksport, the radio station the program was hosted on, in March 2002 after failing to use the profanity delay to &quot;dump&quot; a caller&#x27;s remarks that the British Royal Family should be shot.

<text>The Naked Eye is a 1956 American documentary film about the history of photography directed by Louis Clyde Stoumen.

==Technique==
In a 1961 letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the photographer-filmmaker surveyed earlier uses of the technique of moving still images by himself and others:

“Curt Oertel made his ‘Michaelangelo,’ with important storytelling use of still material, in 1940 (released as Robert Flaherty’s ‘The Titan’ around 1949). Belgium’s Henri Starc began imparting dramatic film form to still images in 1936, and his lyric ‘World of Paul Delvaux’ (1947) is an acknowledged classic. Paul Haesaerts made ‘Rubens’ in 1948. Americans Paul Falkenberg and Lewis Jacobs made ‘Lincoln Speaks at Gettysburg’ entirely out of nineteenth-century engravings, 1950. Ben Berg and Herbert Block of Hollywood have for years been making a series of story-telling dramas out of paintings and prints, including a life story of Goya. I myself pioneered the dramatic use of still photographs (rather than paintings or prints) in a story-telling sequence for Arch Oboler’s 1950 Columbia feature ‘Five,’ and have for more than a decade continued development of this form—in my independent feature ‘The Naked Eye’ (1956), the featurette ‘The True Story of the Civil War’ (an Academy Award winner, 1956), Warner Brothers’ ‘The James Dean Story’ (1957), and most recently...for...ABC-TV’s ‘Winston Churchill, the Valiant Years.”

==Accolades==
It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

<doc id="228148" wikidata="Q199687" url="?curid=228148" title="Remote sensing">
<text>Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, in contrast to in situ or on-site observation. The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geophysics, geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines (e.g. exploration geophysics, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology). It also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications, among others.

In current usage, the term &quot;remote sensing&quot; generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. It includes the surface and the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It may be split into &quot;active&quot; remote sensing (when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft to the object and its reflection is detected by the sensor) and &quot;passive&quot; remote sensing (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor).

== Overview ==

Remote sensing can be divided into two types of methods: &quot;Passive remote sensing&quot; and &quot;Active remote sensing.&quot; Passive sensors gather radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors. Examples of passive remote sensors include film photography, infrared, charge-coupled devices, and radiometers. Active collection, on the other hand, emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. RADAR and LiDAR are examples of active remote sensing where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, speed and direction of an object.
Remote sensing makes it possible to collect data of dangerous or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing applications include monitoring deforestation in areas such as the Amazon Basin, glacial features in Arctic and Antarctic regions, and depth sounding of coastal and ocean depths. Military collection during the Cold War made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas. Remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground, ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.

Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as El Niño and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the earth sciences such as natural resource management, agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation, greenhouse gas monitoring, oil spill detection and monitoring, and national security and overhead, ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas.

== Types of data acquisition techniques ==
The basis for multispectral collection and analysis is that of examined areas or objects that reflect or emit radiation that stand out from surrounding areas. For a summary of major remote sensing satellite systems see the overview table.
=== Applications of remote sensing ===
* Conventional radar is mostly associated with aerial traffic control, early warning, and certain large-scale meteorological data. Doppler radar is used by local law enforcements&#x27; monitoring of speed limits and in enhanced meteorological collection such as wind speed and direction within weather systems in addition to precipitation location and intensity. Other types of active collection includes plasmas in the ionosphere. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar is used to produce precise digital elevation models of large scale terrain (See RADARSAT, TerraSAR-X, Magellan).
* Laser and radar altimeters on satellites have provided a wide range of data. By measuring the bulges of water caused by gravity, they map features on the seafloor to a resolution of a mile or so. By measuring the height and wavelength of ocean waves, the altimeters measure wind speeds and direction, and surface ocean currents and directions.
* Ultrasound (acoustic) and radar tide gauges measure sea level, tides and wave direction in coastal and offshore tide gauges.
* Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is used for weapon ranging, laser illuminated homing of projectiles, and to detect and measure the concentration of various chemicals in the atmosphere while airborne LIDAR can be used to measure the heights of objects and features on the ground more accurately than radar technology. LIDAR can be used to detect ground surface changes. Vegetation remote sensing is a principal application of LIDAR.
* Radiometers and photometers are the most common instrument in use, collecting reflected and emitted radiation in a wide range of frequencies. The most common are visible and infrared sensors, followed by microwave, gamma-ray, and rarely, ultraviolet. They may also be used to detect the emission spectra of various chemicals, providing data on chemical concentrations in the atmosphere.
* Radiometers are also used at night, because artificial light emissions are a key signature of human activity. Applications include remote sensing of population, GDP, and damage to infrastructure from war or disasters.
* Radiometers and radar onboard of satellites can be used to monitor volcanic eruptions 
* Spectropolarimetric Imaging has been reported to be useful for target tracking purposes by researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. They determined that manmade items possess polarimetric signatures that are not found in natural objects. These conclusions were drawn from the imaging of military trucks, like the Humvee, and trailers with their acousto-optic tunable filter dual hyperspectral and spectropolarimetric VNIR Spectropolarimetric Imager.
* Stereographic pairs of aerial photographs have often been used to make topographic maps by imagery and terrain analysts in trafficability and highway departments for potential routes, in addition to modelling terrestrial habitat features.
* Simultaneous multi-spectral platforms such as Landsat have been in use since the 1970s. These thematic mappers take images in multiple wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation (multi-spectral) and are usually found on Earth observation satellites, including (for example) the Landsat program or the IKONOS satellite. Maps of land cover and land use from thematic mapping can be used to prospect for minerals, detect or monitor land usage, detect invasive vegetation, deforestation, and examine the health of indigenous plants and crops (satellite crop monitoring), including entire farming regions or forests. Prominent scientists using remote sensing for this purpose include Janet Franklin and Ruth DeFries. Landsat images are used by regulatory agencies such as KYDOW to indicate water quality parameters including Secchi depth, chlorophyll density, and total phosphorus content. Weather satellites are used in meteorology and climatology.
* Hyperspectral imaging produces an image where each pixel has full spectral information with imaging narrow spectral bands over a contiguous spectral range. Hyperspectral imagers are used in various applications including mineralogy, biology, defence, and environmental measurements.
* Within the scope of the combat against desertification, remote sensing allows researchers to follow up and monitor risk areas in the long term, to determine desertification factors, to support decision-makers in defining relevant measures of environmental management, and to assess their impacts.
* Remotely sensed multi- and hyperspectral images can be used for assessing biodiversity at different scales. Since the spectral properties of different plants species are unique, it is possible to get information about properties that relates to biodiversity such as habitat heterogeneity, spectral diversity and plant functional trait.
* Remote sensing has been used to detect rare plants to aid in conservation efforts. Prediction, detection, and the ability to record biophysical conditions were possible from medium to very high resolutions.
* Agricultural and environmental statistics, usually combining classified satellite images with ground truth data collected on a sample selected on an area sampling frame

=== Geodetic ===

* Geodetic remote sensing can be gravimetric or geometric. Overhead gravity data collection was first used in aerial submarine detection. This data revealed minute perturbations in the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field that may be used to determine changes in the mass distribution of the Earth, which in turn may be used for geophysical studies, as in GRACE. Geometric remote sensing includes position and deformation imaging using InSAR, LIDAR, etc.

=== Acoustic and near-acoustic ===
* Sonar: &quot;passive sonar&quot;, listening for the sound made by another object (a vessel, a whale etc.); &quot;active sonar&quot;, emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes, used for detecting, ranging and measurements of underwater objects and terrain.
* Seismograms taken at different locations can locate and measure earthquakes (after they occur) by comparing the relative intensity and precise timings.
* Ultrasound: Ultrasound sensors, that emit high-frequency pulses and listening for echoes, used for detecting water waves and water level, as in tide gauges or for towing tanks.

To coordinate a series of large-scale observations, most sensing systems depend on the following: platform location and the orientation of the sensor. High-end instruments now often use positional information from satellite navigation systems. The rotation and orientation are often provided within a degree or two with electronic compasses. Compasses can measure not just azimuth (i. e. degrees to magnetic north), but also altitude (degrees above the horizon), since the magnetic field curves into the Earth at different angles at different latitudes. More exact orientations require gyroscopic-aided orientation, periodically realigned by different methods including navigation from stars or known benchmarks.

== Data characteristics ==
The quality of remote sensing data consists of its spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions.

; Spatial resolution: The size of a pixel that is recorded in a raster image – typically pixels may correspond to square areas ranging in side length from .
; Spectral resolution: The wavelength of the different frequency bands recorded – usually, this is related to the number of frequency bands recorded by the platform. Current Landsat collection is that of seven bands, including several in the infrared spectrum, ranging from a spectral resolution of 0.7 to 2.1 μm. The Hyperion sensor on Earth Observing-1 resolves 220 bands from 0.4 to 2.5 μm, with a spectral resolution of 0.10 to 0.11 μm per band.
; Radiometric resolution: The number of different intensities of radiation the sensor is able to distinguish. Typically, this ranges from 8 to 14 bits, corresponding to 256 levels of the gray scale and up to 16,384 intensities or &quot;shades&quot; of colour, in each band. It also depends on the instrument noise.
; Temporal resolution: The frequency of flyovers by the satellite or plane, and is only relevant in time-series studies or those requiring an averaged or mosaic image as in deforesting monitoring. This was first used by the intelligence community where repeated coverage revealed changes in infrastructure, the deployment of units or the modification/introduction of equipment. Cloud cover over a given area or object makes it necessary to repeat the collection of said location.

== Data processing ==
In order to create sensor-based maps, most remote sensing systems expect to extrapolate sensor data in relation to a reference point including distances between known points on the ground. This depends on the type of sensor used. For example, in conventional photographs, distances are accurate in the center of the image, with the distortion of measurements increasing the farther you get from the center. Another factor is that of the platen against which the film is pressed can cause severe errors when photographs are used to measure ground distances. The step in which this problem is resolved is called georeferencing and involves computer-aided matching of points in the image (typically 30 or more points per image) which is extrapolated with the use of an established benchmark, &quot;warping&quot; the image to produce accurate spatial data. As of the early 1990s, most satellite images are sold fully georeferenced.

In addition, images may need to be radiometrically and atmospherically corrected.

; Radiometric correction: Allows avoidance of radiometric errors and distortions. The illumination of objects on the Earth&#x27;s surface is uneven because of different properties of the relief. This factor is taken into account in the method of radiometric distortion correction. Radiometric correction gives a scale to the pixel values, e. g. the monochromatic scale of 0 to 255 will be converted to actual radiance values.
; Topographic correction (also called terrain correction): In rugged mountains, as a result of terrain, the effective illumination of pixels varies considerably. In a remote sensing image, the pixel on the shady slope receives weak illumination and has a low radiance value, in contrast, the pixel on the sunny slope receives strong illumination and has a high radiance value. For the same object, the pixel radiance value on the shady slope will be different from that on the sunny slope. Additionally, different objects may have similar radiance values. These ambiguities seriously affected remote sensing image information extraction accuracy in mountainous areas. It became the main obstacle to the further application of remote sensing images. The purpose of topographic correction is to eliminate this effect, recovering the true reflectivity or radiance of objects in horizontal conditions. It is the premise of quantitative remote sensing application.
; Atmospheric correction: Elimination of atmospheric haze by rescaling each frequency band so that its minimum value (usually realised in water bodies) corresponds to a pixel value of 0. The digitizing of data also makes it possible to manipulate the data by changing gray-scale values.

Interpretation is the critical process of making sense of the data. The first application was that of aerial photographic collection which used the following process; spatial measurement through the use of a light table in both conventional single or stereographic coverage, added skills such as the use of photogrammetry, the use of photomosaics, repeat coverage, Making use of objects&#x27; known dimensions in order to detect modifications. Image Analysis is the recently developed automated computer-aided application that is in increasing use.

Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is a sub-discipline of GIScience devoted to partitioning remote sensing (RS) imagery into meaningful image-objects, and assessing their characteristics through spatial, spectral and temporal scale.

Old data from remote sensing is often valuable because it may provide the only long-term data for a large extent of geography. At the same time, the data is often complex to interpret, and bulky to store. Modern systems tend to store the data digitally, often with lossless compression. The difficulty with this approach is that the data is fragile, the format may be archaic, and the data may be easy to falsify. One of the best systems for archiving data series is as computer-generated machine-readable ultrafiche, usually in typefonts such as OCR-B, or as digitized half-tone images. Ultrafiches survive well in standard libraries, with lifetimes of several centuries. They can be created, copied, filed and retrieved by automated systems. They are about as compact as archival magnetic media, and yet can be read by human beings with minimal, standardized equipment.

Generally speaking, remote sensing works on the principle of the &quot;inverse problem&quot;: while the object or phenomenon of interest (the state) may not be directly measured, there exists some other variable that can be detected and measured (the observation) which may be related to the object of interest through a calculation. The common analogy given to describe this is trying to determine the type of animal from its footprints. For example, while it is impossible to directly measure temperatures in the upper atmosphere, it is possible to measure the spectral emissions from a known chemical species (such as carbon dioxide) in that region. The frequency of the emissions may then be related via thermodynamics to the temperature in that region.

=== Data processing levels ===
To facilitate the discussion of data processing in practice, several processing &quot;levels&quot; were first defined in 1986 by NASA as part of its Earth Observing System and steadily adopted since then, both internally at NASA (e. g.,) and elsewhere (e. g.,); these definitions are:
A Level 1 data record is the most fundamental (i. e., highest reversible level) data record that has significant scientific utility, and is the foundation upon which all subsequent data sets are produced. Level 2 is the first level that is directly usable for
most scientific applications; its value is much greater than the lower levels. Level 2 data sets tend to be less voluminous than Level 1 data because they have been reduced temporally, spatially, or spectrally. Level 3 data sets are generally smaller than lower level data sets and thus can be dealt with without incurring a great deal of data handling overhead. These data tend to be generally more useful for many applications. The regular spatial and temporal organization of Level 3 datasets makes it feasible to readily combine data from different sources.

While these processing levels are particularly suitable for typical satellite data processing pipelines, other data level vocabularies have been defined and may be appropriate for more heterogeneous workflows.

==Applications==
Satellite images provide very useful information to produce statistics on topics closely related to the territory, such as agriculture, forestry or land cover in general. The first large project to apply Landsata 1 images for statistics was LACIE (Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment), run by NASA, NOAA and the USDA in 1974–77. Many other application projects on crop area estimation have followed, including the Italian AGRIT project and the MARS project of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. Forest area and deforestation estimation have also been a frequent target of remote sensing projects, the same as land cover and land use

Ground truth or reference data to train and validate image classification require a field survey if we are targetting annual crops or individual forest species, but may be substituted by photointerpretation if we look at wider classes that can be reliably identified on aerial photos or satellite images. It is relevant to highlight that probabilistic sampling is not critical for the selection of training pixels for image classification, but it is necessary for accuracy assessment of the classified images and area estimation. Additional care is recommended to ensure that training and validation datasets are not spatially correlated.

We suppose now that we have classified images or a land cover map produced by visual photo-interpretation, with a legend of mapped classes that suits our purpose, taking again the example of wheat. The straightforward approach is counting the number of pixels classified as wheat and multiplying by the area of each pixel. Many authors have noticed that estimator is that it is generally biased because commission and omission errors in a confusion matrix do not compensate each other 

The main strength of classified satellite images or other indicators computed on satellite images is providing cheap information on the whole target area or most of it. This information usually has a good correlation with the target variable (ground truth) that is usually expensive to observe in an unbiased and accurate way. Therefore it can be observed on a probabilistic sample selected on an area sampling frame. Traditional survey methodology provides different methods to combine accurate information on a sample with less accurate, but exhaustive, data for a covariable or proxy that is cheaper to collect. For agricultural statistics, field surveys are usually required, while photo-interpretation may better for land cover classes that can be reliably identified on aerial photographs or high resolution satellite images. Additional uncertainty can appear because of imperfect reference data (ground truth or similar).

Some options are: ratio estimator, regression estimator, calibration estimators and small area estimators

If we target other variables, such as crop yield or leaf area, we may need different indicators to be computed from images, such as the NDVI, a good proxy to chlorophyll activity.

== History ==


The modern discipline of remote sensing arose with the development of flight. The balloonist G. Tournachon (alias Nadar) made photographs of Paris from his balloon in 1858. Messenger pigeons, kites, rockets and unmanned balloons were also used for early images. With the exception of balloons, these first, individual images were not particularly useful for map making or for scientific purposes.

Systematic aerial photography was developed for military surveillance and reconnaissance purposes beginning in World War I. After WWI, remote sensing technology was quickly adapted to civilian applications. This is demonstrated by the first line of a 1941 textbook titled &quot;Aerophotography and Aerosurverying,&quot; which stated the following:
The development of remote sensing technology reached a climax during the Cold War with the use of modified combat aircraft such as the P-51, P-38, RB-66 and the F-4C, or specifically designed collection platforms such as the U2/TR-1, SR-71, A-5 and the OV-1 series both in overhead and stand-off collection. A more recent development is that of increasingly smaller sensor pods such as those used by law enforcement and the military, in both manned and unmanned platforms. The advantage of this approach is that this requires minimal modification to a given airframe. Later imaging technologies would include infrared, conventional, Doppler and synthetic aperture radar.

The development of artificial satellites in the latter half of the 20th century allowed remote sensing to progress to a global scale as of the end of the Cold War. Instrumentation aboard various Earth observing and weather satellites such as Landsat, the Nimbus and more recent missions such as RADARSAT and UARS provided global measurements of various data for civil, research, and military purposes. Space probes to other planets have also provided the opportunity to conduct remote sensing studies in extraterrestrial environments, synthetic aperture radar aboard the Magellan spacecraft provided detailed topographic maps of Venus, while instruments aboard SOHO allowed studies to be performed on the Sun and the solar wind, just to name a few examples.

Recent developments include, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, the development of image processing of satellite imagery. The use of the term &quot;remote sensing&quot; began in the early 1960s when Evelyn Pruitt realized that advances in science meant that aerial photography was no longer an adequate term to describe the data streams being generated by new technologies. With assistance from her fellow staff member at the Office of Naval Research, Walter Bailey, she coined the term &quot;remote sensing&quot;. Several research groups in Silicon Valley including NASA Ames Research Center, GTE, and ESL Inc. developed Fourier transform techniques leading to the first notable enhancement of imagery data. In 1999 the first commercial satellite (IKONOS) collecting very high resolution imagery was launched.

== Training and education ==
Remote Sensing has a growing relevance in the modern information society. It represents a key technology as part of the aerospace industry and bears increasing economic relevance – new sensors e.g. TerraSAR-X and RapidEye are developed constantly and the demand for skilled labour is increasing steadily. Furthermore, remote sensing exceedingly influences everyday life, ranging from weather forecasts to reports on climate change or natural disasters. As an example, 80% of the German students use the services of Google Earth; in 2006 alone the software was downloaded 100 million times. But studies have shown that only a fraction of them know more about the data they are working with. There exists a huge knowledge gap between the application and the understanding of satellite images.
Remote sensing only plays a tangential role in schools, regardless of the political claims to strengthen the support for teaching on the subject. A lot of the computer software explicitly developed for school lessons has not yet been implemented due to its complexity. Thereby, the subject is either not at all integrated into the curriculum or does not pass the step of an interpretation of analogue images. In fact, the subject of remote sensing requires a consolidation of physics and mathematics as well as competences in the fields of media and methods apart from the mere visual interpretation of satellite images.

Many teachers have great interest in the subject &quot;remote sensing&quot;, being motivated to integrate this topic into teaching, provided that the curriculum is considered. In many cases, this encouragement fails because of confusing information. In order to integrate remote sensing in a sustainable manner organizations like the EGU or Digital Earth encourage the development of learning modules and learning portals. Examples include: &quot;FIS – Remote Sensing in School Lessons&quot;, &quot;Geospektiv&quot;, &quot;Ychange&quot;, or Spatial Discovery, to promote media and method qualifications as well as independent learning.

== Software ==

Remote sensing data are processed and analyzed with computer software, known as a remote sensing application. A large number of proprietary and open source applications exist to process remote sensing data.

== Remote Sensing with gamma rays ==
There are applications of gamma rays to mineral exploration through remote sensing. In 1972 more than two million dollars were spent on remote sensing applications with gamma rays to mineral exploration. Gamma rays are used to search for deposits of uranium. By observing radioactivity from potassium, porphyry copper deposits can be located. A high ratio of uranium to thorium has been found to be related to the presence of hydrothermal copper deposits. Radiation patterns have also been known to occur above oil and gas fields, but some of these patterns were thought to be due to surface soils instead of oil and gas.

<text>The Vanier Cup () is a post season university football championship game, used to determine the national champion in U Sports football. The game is the final for the winners of the Uteck Bowl and the Mitchell Bowl. In turn, the participating teams are determined by the winners of 4 bowl games: the Loney Bowl (AUS), Hardy Cup (Canada West), Dunsmore Cup (RSEQ), and Yates Cup (OUA).

The Laval Rouge et Or have won the most Vanier Cups (12), while the Western Mustangs have the most appearances (15). Eighteen teams have won the Vanier Cup, while three others have played for the championship but never won. There are six active teams that have never appeared in the championship game. The most recent game, the 59th Vanier Cup, was played on November 23, 2024, at Kingston, Ontario. In this game, the Laval Rouge et Or defeated the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks 22–17 to win their twelfth championship.

==History==
The Vanier Cup was created in 1965 as the championship trophy of the Canadian College Bowl. For the first two years of competition, the Canadian College Bowl was an invitational event, with a national panel selecting two teams to play, similar to other U.S. collegiate bowl games. In 1967, the Canadian College Bowl was declared the national football championship of the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union, later Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) and now U Sports, with a playoff system determining the two participants.

The Vanier Cup was played in Toronto, Ontario, from its inception in 1965 through 2003. However, after the CIS opened the game to host conference bids in 2001, the possibility arose to have games held outside Toronto. As of 2023, 41 of the 61 Vanier Cups have been played in Toronto, eight in Quebec City, five in Hamilton, one in Regina, one in Saskatoon, one in Vancouver, one in London, Ontario, one in Montreal, and one in Kingston. No games have been staged in the Atlantic region. Four times, the game has been played in the same city and during the same weekend as the Grey Cup: 1973, 2007 and 2012 in Toronto and in 2011 in Vancouver at BC Place Stadium.

The winners trophy is named after Georges Vanier, the former governor general of Canada and was first awarded in 1965 to the winner of an invitational event contested between two teams that were selected by a panel. In 1967, the trophy was declared the official &quot;CIAU National Football Championship&quot; and a playoff system was instituted. From its creation until 1982, it was known as the Canadian College Bowl. The game typically occurs in late November, although it is occasionally played in December.

On June 8, 2020, U Sports announced that all fall athletics championships for the 2020–21 season had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Appearances by team==
E. The Wilfrid Laurier record includes three games played as Waterloo Lutheran.

Six active teams have never played for the Vanier Cup: Bishop&#x27;s Gaiters (AUS/RSEQ/OQIFC), Carleton Ravens (OUA), Sherbrooke Vert-et-Or (RSEQ), Waterloo Warriors (OUA), Windsor Lancers (OUA), and York Lions/Yeomen (OUA).

== Awards ==
The Vanier Cup&#x27;s most valuable player is awarded the Ted Morris Memorial Trophy. It was first awarded at the first championship in 1965 and named in honour of Teddy Morris, who died the same year. Morris, a Hall of Fame former Toronto Argonauts player and coach, was an organizer of the first bowl and champion for developing Canadian players.

The Bruce Coulter Award was first awarded in 1992 and is dependent on what position the winner of the Ted Morris Trophy played. If the winner is from the offence, then the Bruce Coulter Award winner will be the most outstanding defensive player or vice versa. It was named after Bruce Coulter, long-time Head Coach of the Bishop&#x27;s Gaiters and former offensive and defensive player with the Montreal Alouettes in the 1950s. Coulter was inducted as a builder in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1997.

== Broadcasting ==

The Vanier Cup final game is regularly broadcast nationally. From 1965 though 1976 it was broadcast on CBC Television, from 1977 through 1988 it was broadcast on the CTV Television Network. In 1989, TSN acquired rights to the game, lasting through to 2012 (besides a one-year stint on The Score in 2008).

In November 2010, the rights to the Vanier Cup were purchased by sports marketing company MRX. The 2011 game was held in Vancouver, on the same weekend as the 99th Grey Cup and for the first time it was fully integrated into the Grey Cup Festival as a festival event.

In 2012, the 48th Vanier Cup, played between Laval and McMaster at Rogers Centre in Toronto became both the most attended and most watched Vanier Cup ever. Held the same weekend and in the same city as the 100th Grey Cup, the game was attended by 37,098. The previous record was set in 1989 at the 25th Vanier Cup, when 32,847 watched the game between Western and Saskatchewan that was also played at SkyDome (now Rogers Centre). The game, broadcast on TSN and RDS was watched by 910,000.

In February 2013, the CIS terminated the option years on their agreement with MRX opting for an open bid process for the hosting of the game. Laval University, in Quebec City, was the only bidder for the game and won the right to host the 49th Vanier Cup. In May, CIS terminated its agreement with TSN, and entered into a six-year deal with Sportsnet to broadcast its championships, including the Vanier Cup.

The switch in venues, the decoupling of the Vanier Cup from Grey Cup week, and the change in broadcaster, led to a precipitous drop in attendance and viewership. A total of 301,000 viewers watched Laval defeat the Calgary Dinos 25–14 Saturday, November 23, 2013, which was a decline of 64 per cent from the previous year. A standing room crowd of 18,543 were on hand at the Telus Stadium which was a decline of 50 per cent from the previous year in Toronto (although a sellout in that venue). In 2019, after several more years of declines, the Vanier Cup returned to CBC.

<text>The International Actuarial Association (IAA) is a worldwide association of local professional actuarial associations.

== History ==
The IAA is the continuation of the &quot;Comité Permanent des Congrès d’Actuaires&quot;, established in 1895, as an association of individuals. It was renamed the IAA in 1968. At the 26th International Congress of Actuaries, held in Birmingham on 7–12 June 1998, the General Assembly of the International Actuarial Association restructured itself.

The restructure created a single unified framework to ensure unity of direction and efficient coordination with respect to issues of a worldwide nature. The major responsibilities of the IAA are now in the hands of the actuarial associations, which bring together the actuaries in their respective countries and is the link between the actuaries and the actuarial associations worldwide. The IAA is the unique international organization dedicated to the research, education and development of the profession and of actuarial associations.

== Sections ==
The IAA has six sections, AFIR-ERM, ASTIN, IAAHS, IAALS, IACA, PBSS.

=== Actuarial Approach for Financial Risks ===
The &quot;Actuarial Approach for Financial Risks&quot; (AFIR-ERM) section and was founded in 1988. It has as its objective the promotion of actuarial research in financial risks and enterprise risk management, and its most important function is the organizing of annual colloquia.

=== Actuarial Studies In Non-Life Insurance ===
The &quot;Actuarial Studies In Non-life insurance&quot; (ASTIN) section was founded in 1957. ASTIN organises annual colloquia and jointly publishes with the other sections, the ASTIN Bulletin, an internationally renowned referenced scientific journal.

=== International Actuarial Association Health Section ===
The &quot;International Actuarial Association Health Section&quot; (IAAHS) was founded in 2003 to provide an international perspective on health actuarial practice, public and private health insurance, and health policy matters.

=== International Actuarial Association Life Section ===
The &quot;International Actuarial Association Life Section&quot; (IAALS) has as its objectives to promote and facilitate an international exchange of views, advice, research and practical information among actuaries involved with life insurance issues.

=== International Association of Consulting Actuaries ===
The &quot;International Association of Consulting Actuaries&quot; (IACA) is the consulting section of the IAA.

The IACA first met in 1960, and was formally constituted in 1968. It held international meetings every other year to consider issues of concern to consulting actuaries. Much of the impetus for early meetings was stimulated by Max Lander and Geoffrey Heywood, who continued to play a prominent role in the Association for many years and were elected Emeritus Members of its Committee in 1976.

In 1999, following a restructuring of the IAA, the IACA was admitted as the consulting section of the IAA.

=== Pensions, Benefits and Social Security ===
The &quot;Pensions, Benefits, Social Security Section&quot; (PBSS) was founded in 2003 to serve actuaries around the world who have personal, professional, educational or research interests in social protection and the commercial, social and public policy issues concerning the provision of pensions and other benefits.

== Governance ==
The IAA Council comprises the President whose term of office is one year, the officers and one delegate per full member association and one delegate per section. The committees and the council normally meet twice a year in different countries.

The Officers for the period January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 are:

* Bozenna Hinton, President
* Mike Lombardi, President-Elect
* Charles Cowling, Immediate Past President

The Council elects an Executive Committee to coordinate activities and operations, and propose strategies, budgets, membership fees and Council meeting venues. The President chairs the Executive Committee, which comprises the Officers and 8 elected at-large members.

== Member associations ==
Currently, the IAA has 73 full member associations, 27 associate member associations, six partners organisations and 3 patrons. All individual actuaries can elect to join any section of the IAA, which currently are ASTIN, AFIR-ERM, IACA, IAAHS, IAALS and PBSS by paying the required contribution.

<text>Heroes of Might and Magic (commonly abbreviated HoMM), known as Might &amp; Magic Heroes in 2011–2024, is a series of video games created and developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing. 

As part of the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; franchise, the series changed ownership when NWC was acquired by 3DO and again when 3DO closed down and sold the rights to Ubisoft.&lt;ref name=&quot;3DO/Ubi&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The games feature turn-based, fantasy-themed conflicts in which players control armies of mythical creatures. The series began in 1995 with the release of the first title. A seventh installment, &quot;Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII&quot;, was released on September 29, 2015.

New World Computing closed after the production of &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic IV&quot;, and since then the rights to the franchise have been owned by Ubisoft. Nival Interactive developed the first game in the series since the changeover, &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic V&quot;. Black Hole Entertainment developed its sequel &quot;Might &amp; Magic Heroes VI.&quot; Still, Limbic Entertainment developed later patches and the DLC, as well as &quot;Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII&quot;. Virtuos developed the &quot;Shades of Darkness&quot; standalone expansion for &quot;Heroes VI&quot;.

The series is directed primarily at the DOS and Windows platforms, with sporadic support for macOS over the years. In addition to Windows and Mac platforms, &quot;Heroes II&quot; was ported to RISC OS and &quot;Heroes III&quot; was ported to Linux. GameTap carried the first four games in the series beginning in 2006. Remakes have also appeared in Game Boy Color.

==Games==

===Precursors===
&quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot;, produced by New World Computing in 1990, largely anticipated the design of &quot;Heroes&quot; and is included in some &quot;Heroes&quot; anthologies as the series forerunner. It was remade for the PlayStation 2 in 2001 under the new title &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff&quot;. Multiple sequels to &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; unrelated to the &quot;Heroes&quot; series have been released by 1C Company starting in 2008 with &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: The Legend&quot;.

The release of the first &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; was preceded by the first five entries in the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; series, but &quot;Heroes&quot; took place on the planet Enroth, which had not been featured in the parent series yet. This would change with the sixth through eighth &quot;Might and Magic&quot; games, which were also set on Enroth and featured storylines overlapping or connecting with the first three &quot;Heroes&quot; titles. Both the fourth &quot;Heroes&quot; title and ninth &quot;Might and Magic&quot; title were set on the planet Axeoth, following Enroth&#x27;s destruction, but their storylines were independent of each other.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Heroes&quot; series is within the genre of turn-based strategy. The titular heroes are player characters who can recruit armies, move around the map, capture resources, and engage in combat. The heroes also incorporate some role-playing game elements; they possess a set of statistics that confer bonuses to an army, artifacts that enhance their powers, and knowledge of magical spells that can be used to attack enemies or produce strategic benefits. Also, heroes gain experience levels from battle, such that veteran heroes are significantly more powerful than inexperienced ones. Experienced heroes may persist through a campaign, but generally do not carry over between scenarios.

On a typical map, players begin a game with one town of a chosen alignment. The number of different alignments varies throughout the series, with the lowest count of four appearing initially in &quot;Heroes I&quot; and peaking at nine in the &quot;Heroes III&quot; expansion packs &quot;Armageddon&#x27;s Blade&quot;. Each town alignment hosts a unique selection of creatures from which the player can build an army. Town alignment also determines other unique traits such as native hero classes, special bonuses or abilities, and leanings toward certain skills or kinds of magic.

Towns play a central role in the games since they are the primary source of income and new recruits. A typical objective in each game is to capture all enemy towns. Maps may also start with neutral towns, which do not send out heroes but may still be captured by any player. It is therefore possible, and common, to have more towns than players on a map. When captured, a town retains its alignment type, allowing the new owner to create a mixed army, although Heroes VI introduces the ability to change a town&#x27;s alignment to the capturing player&#x27;s. A player or team is eliminated when no towns or heroes are left under their control, or they do not control a town for seven consecutive days. Barring any special conditions, the last player or team remaining is the victor.

A side objective commonly appearing in the series is the acquisition of a powerful object called the &quot;ultimate artifact&quot; (&quot;Heroes I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;), grail (&quot;III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;), or Tear of Asha (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;VI&quot;, and &quot;VII&quot;), buried somewhere on the map. In all games except &quot;Heroes VI&quot;, heroes visit special locations (called obelisks, or oracles in &quot;Heroes IV&quot;) to gradually reveal a map of the location of the artifact; in &quot;Heroes VI&quot;, a hero must instead collect four Fragments of the Moon Disc, which then causes the Tear of Asha to appear somewhere on the map. The ultimate artifact provides immense bonuses to the hero that carries it; the grail or Tear of Asha allows the hero to construct a special building in one of their towns that confers immense bonuses to the player.

===Time and resource model===
Each turn (consisting of all players&#x27; moves) is represented as a single day, and days are organized into cycles of weeks and months (measured as four weeks). The primary resource is gold, which is generated by towns on a daily basis. Gold alone is sufficient for obtaining basic buildings and most creatures. As construction progresses, increasing amounts of secondary resources such as wood, ore, gems, crystals, sulfur, and mercury are required. These resources, as well as gold, are produced at mines and other secondary structures, which are located on the map and require heroes to capture them. As with towns, mines can also be captured by enemy heroes, presenting an additional avenue for conflict.

At the start of each week (each day in &quot;Heroes IV&quot;), creature dwellings produce new recruits, and in most cases neutral armies will increase in size (by default; can be turned off if desired). In some of the games, the start of a new month causes neutral armies to spawn all over the map, providing fresh challenges and opportunities.

===Combat===
Whenever a player engages in battle, the game changes from the adventure map display to a combat screen, which is based on either a hexagonal or square grid. In this mode, the game mimics the turn-based tactics genre, as the engaged armies must carry through the battle without the opportunity to reinforce or gracefully retreat. With few exceptions, combat must end with the losing army deserting, being destroyed, or paying a heavy price in gold to surrender. Surrendering allows the player to keep the remaining units intact.

Creatures in an army are represented by unit stacks, each of which consists of a single type of creature, in any quantity. A limited number of stacks are available to each army, varying by game. Players generally maneuver their stacks attempting to achieve the most favorable rate of attrition for themselves. The games also have an automatic combat option that allows the computer to make tactical choices for a player. Heroes participate in battle as well: passively by granting bonuses to their army, and actively by engaging in combat and casting spells. In most of the games, heroes do not act as units, and cannot be harmed. However, in &quot;Heroes IV&quot; they do act as regular units and can be &quot;killed&quot;; these dead heroes are transferred to the nearest town&#x27;s dungeon where they can be freed if their team captures the town.

Combat is affected by several random factors. In addition to simulating dice rolls to determine damage, a variety of influences including hero abilities and special bonuses determine a unit&#x27;s luck and morale ratings, which affect the likelihood of those units triggering a bonus during combat. A unit that triggers good luck deals more (or receives less) damage, and a unit that triggers high morale receives an extra turn. In some other games, luck and morale can also be negative, with opposite corresponding effects. Luck and morale can be improved by hero abilities, artifacts, and spells. Morale may suffer with overwhelming odds in combat or by mixing incompatible unit types (e.g. Chaos with Order.)

===History of changes===
Knowledge allows heroes to cast more spells, either through a spell memorization (HoMM I) or spell point (II-V) system.

&quot;Heroes II&quot; introduced secondary skills. Heroes can learn a limited variety of secondary skills with several levels of proficiency. Secondary skills give specific, miscellaneous bonuses to heroes and their armies. For example, skill in logistics increases the distance a hero&#x27;s army can travel, while skill in leadership gives their army a morale bonus.

Beginning with &quot;Heroes II&quot;, some creatures were able to be upgraded. By &quot;Heroes III&quot;, every creature (excluding those not found in any castle) was able to be upgraded.

&quot;Heroes III&quot; also introduced a new artifact platform; rather than having 14 spaces for any artifact, the player instead has a much larger backpack, but can only use a limited number. For example, only one headpiece can be used at a time, as well as only one pair of boots, etc.

===Replay value===
Games in the series often include a map editor and/or random map generator. Several fansites collect and rate user-generated maps.

==Storyline==
===Old world===

Aside from &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic V&quot;, &quot;VI&quot;, and &quot;VII&quot;, the &quot;Heroes&quot; series take place in the same fictional universe as the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; series, and later &quot;Might and Magic&quot; installments heavily referenced the games, with some taking place on the same world.

&quot;Heroes I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; take place on the planet of Enroth, on a northerly continent of the same name, and chronicle the adventures of the Ironfist dynasty. The protagonist of &quot;Heroes I&quot; is Lord Morglin Ironfist, a knight originally from the world of Varn (the setting of &quot;Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum&quot;), who discovers a portal to the realm of Enroth while fleeing from his throne&#x27;s usurpers and goes on to conquer and dominate the continent, establishing a unified kingdom and a new royal family.

&quot;Heroes II&quot; featured a two-sided conflict between Morglin&#x27;s sons, Roland and Archibald, both vying for their deceased father&#x27;s throne. Canonically, the good-natured Roland defeats the evil Archibald, though the player can choose to align themself with either side and experience either outcome. It was the first game in the series to feature playable heroes as campaign characters—the main characters of &quot;Heroes I&quot; were represented by the player&#x27;s presence rather than as commanders on the battlefield.

The storylines of &quot;Heroes III&quot; and the &quot;Heroes Chronicles&quot; shift focus to the Gryphonheart dynasty on the southern continent of Antagarich, and introduces the Kreegan as playable characters and enemies. In &quot;Heroes III&quot;, Queen Catherine Gryphonheart, King Roland Ironfist&#x27;s wife, is called home to attend her father&#x27;s funeral, only to discover Antagarich being torn apart by various factions. &quot;Heroes III&quot;″s expansion packs build on the setting with more prominent character development, featuring new and old heroes from the series in differing roles.

The events preceding &quot;Heroes IV&quot; precipitated the destruction of the planet Enroth due to a clash between Armageddon&#x27;s Blade and the Sword of Frost. The ensuing destruction prompts the opening of portals leading to another world, Axeoth, through which many refugees escape. &quot;Heroes IV&quot;″s campaigns focus on the scattered survivors from Enroth and Antagarich as they form new kingdoms and alliances in the new world.

The 2025 game &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&quot; returned to the old world after the fifth through seventh &quot;Heroes&quot; entries had been set in a new continuity. It takes place 500 years before the first game, and is set on the planet Enroth&#x27;s continent of Jadame, which was the setting of &quot;Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer&quot; but had not been featured in the &quot;Heroes&quot; series before.

===New world===
&quot;Heroes of Might and Magic V&quot; was the first &quot;Might and Magic&quot; title to take place on the previously unheard of world of Ashan, as part of Ubisoft&#x27;s franchise-wide continuity reboot. Its six campaigns are each centered around a faction leader, tied together by the character of Isabel Greyhound, Queen of the Holy Griffin Empire. The &quot;Heroes V&quot; expansion packs both continued this storyline, leading into the events of &quot;Dark Messiah of Might and Magic&quot;. &quot;Heroes VI&quot; acts as a prequel, occurring 400 years prior. &quot;Heroes VII&quot; occurs centuries after &quot;Heroes VI&quot; but still 100 years before &quot;Heroes V&quot;.

==Reception==
Critical reception for the series has been generally positive, with GameRankings scores averaging from the high 70s to high 90s.

By October 1997, overall sales of the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; series had surpassed 500,000 copies. This number had risen to 1.5 million copies by December 1999. The &quot;Might and Magic&quot; franchise as a whole, including the &quot;Heroes&quot; series, surpassed 4.5 million copies in sales by May 2001.

In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; series as number 31 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;With beautiful 2D characters and maps and absolutely brilliant strategy, &quot;Heroes&quot; managed to be a completely engrossing game that never once replaced quality design with new-fangled flash.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Ellendun or Battle of Wroughton was fought between Ecgberht of Wessex and Beornwulf of Mercia in September 825. Sir Frank Stenton described it as &quot;one of the most decisive battles of English history&quot;. It effectively established West Saxon dominance in southern England.

== Background ==

During the 8th century and early 9th centuries, the kings of Mercia exercised a fluctuating hegemony over the kingdoms of south-eastern England, imposing their overlordship and at times exercising direct rule. While Wessex had at times been obliged to recognise the overlordship of Æthelbald of Mercia, it appears to have escaped the dominance of the Mercians thereafter and was certainly not subject to the more intrusive forms of Mercian control imposed on other kingdoms.

Ecgberht&#x27;s father Ealhmund had been king of Kent in the 780s, which had brought his family into conflict with the ambitions of Offa of Mercia, who sought to impose direct rule on Kent. After his father&#x27;s death, Ecgberht was driven from England into exile by Offa, with the co-operation of Beorhtric of Wessex and his accession to the throne of Wessex on Beorhtric&#x27;s death in 802 was immediately followed by a violent clash with Mercia. However, the available sources reveal no further conflict between the two kingdoms before 825.

Beornwulf seized the Mercian throne from Ceolwulf, who had in 821 succeeded on the death of his brother, the long-reigning and powerful Coenwulf. His attack on Wessex two years later may have been part of an effort to consolidate his own authority and reassert that of Mercia after this upheaval.

Beornwulf may also have been seeking to take advantage of Ecgberht&#x27;s preoccupation with warfare against the Britons of Cornwall. Ecgberht had devastated Cornish territory in 815 and in the autumn of 825 he was again campaigning against the Britons, at Gafulford.

== Location ==

The Battle of Ellendun is thought to have taken place south of Swindon, in Wiltshire, but the exact site has not been determined. William Camden, in his 1610 gazetteer &quot;A Chronological description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland&quot;, suggests that the battle took place close to Wilton, just to the west of Salisbury. Charles Oman used geographical information and contemporary boundaries as evidence to suggest the battle occurred at Wroughton, which is south of Swindon. T. Spicer has suggested the battle took place on the grounds of what is now Lydiard Park, in Swindon.

== Consequences ==

Ecgberht&#x27;s victory permanently transformed the political situation in south-eastern England. The king at once sent his son Æthelwulf with an army into the south-east. The West Saxons succeeded in conquering Sussex (hitherto under direct Mercian rule), Kent, and Essex, which had been governed by under-kings who had accepted Mercian overlordship. All of these territories were annexed to Wessex, roughly doubling the kingdom&#x27;s size.

Meanwhile, Beornwulf&#x27;s defeat emboldened the East Angles to revolt against Mercian rule and reassert their independence, in alliance with Wessex. Beornwulf fought the East Angles, but was defeated and killed. His successor Ludeca met the same fate the following year and East Anglian independence was successfully re-established.

Ecgberht&#x27;s power peaked in 829, when he occupied Mercia and secured recognition of his supremacy by the Northumbrians, making him temporarily the overlord of all England. Mercian independence was restored in the following year by Wiglaf, who achieved a significant recovery of Mercian prestige and was even able to extend his power over Berkshire. The independence of East Anglia and the West Saxon conquest of the south-east proved irreversible and Mercia never regained the primacy it had enjoyed in the century before Ellendun.

<text>West Jersey and East Jersey were two distinct parts of the Province of New Jersey. The political division existed for 28 years, between 1674 and 1702. Determination of an exact location for a border between West Jersey and East Jersey was often a matter of dispute.

==Background==
The Delaware Valley had been inhabited by the Lenape (or Delaware) Indians prior to European exploration and settlement starting around 1609, undertaken by the Dutch, Swedish and English. The Dutch West India Company had established one or two Delaware River settlements, but by the late 1620s, it had moved most of its inhabitants to the island of Manhattan. This became the center of New Netherland. West Jersey and East Jersey were two sections of New Jersey.

The development of the colony of New Sweden in the lower Delaware Valley began in 1638. Most of the Swedish population was on the west side of the Delaware. After the English re-established New Netherland&#x27;s Fort Nassau to challenge the Swedes, the latter constructed Fort Nya Elfsborg in present-day Salem County. Fort Nya Elfsborg was located between present day Salem and Alloway Creek. The New Sweden colony established two primary settlements in New Jersey: Sveaborg, now Swedesboro, and Nya Stockholm, now Bridgeport. Trinity Church, located in Swedesboro, was the site of the Church of Sweden for the area.

The Dutch defeated New Sweden in 1655. Settlement of the West Jersey area by Europeans was thin until the English conquest in 1664. Beginning in the late 1670s, Quakers settled in great numbers in this area, first in present-day Salem County and then in Burlington. The latter became the capital of West Jersey.

Before 1674, land surveyors for New Jersey considered it as a hundred and partitioned it into tenths. West Jersey comprised five of the tenths. But demarcation of the boundaries awaited settlement, the quit-rents the settlers would pay, and the land surveying which the money would purchase. Thus it took years and multiple surveys to settle boundary disputes. Burlington County was formed on May 17, 1694 by combining the first and second tenths. At least three surveys were conducted of West Jersey. Richard Tindall was surveyor-general of Fenwick&#x27;s Colony, the fifth tenth.

<doc id="228161" wikidata="Q2346201" url="?curid=228161" title="Bernoulli polynomials">
<text>In mathematics, the Bernoulli polynomials, named after Jacob Bernoulli, combine the Bernoulli numbers and binomial coefficients. They are used for series expansion of functions, and with the Euler–MacLaurin formula.

These polynomials occur in the study of many special functions and, in particular, the Riemann zeta function and the Hurwitz zeta function. They are an Appell sequence (i.e. a Sheffer sequence for the ordinary derivative operator). For the Bernoulli polynomials, the number of crossings of the &quot;x&quot;-axis in the unit interval does not go up with the degree. In the limit of large degree, they approach, when appropriately scaled, the sine and cosine functions.

A similar set of polynomials, based on a generating function, is the family of Euler polynomials.

==Representations==

The Bernoulli polynomials &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be defined by a generating function. They also admit a variety of derived representations.

===Generating functions===
The generating function for the Bernoulli polynomials is
formula_1
The generating function for the Euler polynomials is
formula_2 

===Explicit formula===

formula_3
formula_4
for formula_5, where formula_6 are the Bernoulli numbers, and formula_7 are the Euler numbers. It follows that formula_8 and formula_9.

===Representation by a differential operator===

The Bernoulli polynomials are also given by
formula_10
where formula_11 is differentiation with respect to and the fraction is expanded as a formal power series. It follows that 
formula_12
cf. below. By the same token, the Euler polynomials are given by
formula_13

===Representation by an integral operator===

The Bernoulli polynomials are also the unique polynomials determined by
formula_14

The integral transform
formula_15
on polynomials &quot;f&quot;, simply amounts to 
formula_16
This can be used to produce the inversion formulae below.

== Integral Recurrence ==

In, it is deduced and proved that the Bernoulli polynomials can be obtained by the following integral recurrence
formula_17

==Another explicit formula==

An explicit formula for the Bernoulli polynomials is given by
formula_18

That is similar to the series expression for the Hurwitz zeta function in the complex plane. Indeed, there is the relationship
formula_19
where formula_20 is the Hurwitz zeta function. The latter generalizes the Bernoulli polynomials, allowing for non-integer values 

The inner sum may be understood to be the th forward difference of formula_21 that is,
formula_22
where formula_23 is the forward difference operator. Thus, one may write
formula_24

This formula may be derived from an identity appearing above as follows. Since the forward difference operator equals
formula_25
where is differentiation with respect to , we have, from the Mercator series,
formula_26

As long as this operates on an th-degree polynomial such as formula_21 one may let go from only up 

An integral representation for the Bernoulli polynomials is given by the Nörlund–Rice integral, which follows from the expression as a finite difference.

An explicit formula for the Euler polynomials is given by
formula_28

The above follows analogously, using the fact that
formula_29

==Sums of &quot;p&quot;th powers==
Using either the above integral representation of formula_30 or the identity formula_31, we have
formula_32
(assuming 00 = 1).

==Explicit expressions for low degrees==
The first few Bernoulli polynomials are:
formula_33

The first few Euler polynomials are:
formula_34

==Maximum and minimum==

At higher the amount of variation in formula_35 between formula_36 and formula_37 gets large. For instance, formula_38formula_39 but formula_40formula_41 showed that the maximum value () of formula_35 between and obeys
formula_43
unless is in which case
formula_44
(where formula_45 is the Riemann zeta function), while the minimum () obeys
formula_46
unless in which case
formula_47

These limits are quite close to the actual maximum and minimum, and Lehmer gives more accurate limits as well.

==Differences and derivatives==

The Bernoulli and Euler polynomials obey many relations from umbral calculus:
formula_48
( is the forward difference operator). Also,
formula_49
These polynomial sequences are Appell sequences:
formula_50

===Translations===

formula_51
These identities are also equivalent to saying that these polynomial sequences are Appell sequences. (Hermite polynomials are another example.)

===Symmetries===

formula_52
Zhi-Wei Sun and Hao Pan established the following surprising symmetry relation: If and , then
formula_53
where
formula_54

==Fourier series==

The Fourier series of the Bernoulli polynomials is also a Dirichlet series, given by the expansion
formula_55
Note the simple large &quot;n&quot; limit to suitably scaled trigonometric functions.

This is a special case of the analogous form for the Hurwitz zeta function
formula_56

This expansion is valid only for when and is valid for when .

The Fourier series of the Euler polynomials may also be calculated. Defining the functions
formula_57
for formula_58, the Euler polynomial has the Fourier series
formula_59
Note that the formula_60 and formula_61 are odd and even, respectively:formula_62

They are related to the Legendre chi function formula_63 as
formula_64
==Inversion==
The Bernoulli and Euler polynomials may be inverted to express the monomial in terms of the polynomials.

Specifically, evidently from the above section on integral operators, it follows that 
formula_65
and
formula_66

==Relation to falling factorial==
The Bernoulli polynomials may be expanded in terms of the falling factorial formula_67 as
formula_68
where formula_69 and
formula_70
denotes the Stirling number of the second kind. The above may be inverted to express the falling factorial in terms of the Bernoulli polynomials:
formula_71
where
formula_72
denotes the Stirling number of the first kind.

==Multiplication theorems==
The multiplication theorems were given by Joseph Ludwig Raabe in 1851:

For a natural number ,
formula_73
formula_74

==Integrals==
Two definite integrals relating the Bernoulli and Euler polynomials to the Bernoulli and Euler numbers are:
*formula_75
*formula_76

Another integral formula states
*formula_77
with the special case for formula_78
*formula_79
*formula_80
*formula_81
*formula_82

==Periodic Bernoulli polynomials==
A periodic Bernoulli polynomial is a Bernoulli polynomial evaluated at the fractional part of the argument . These functions are used to provide the remainder term in the Euler–Maclaurin formula relating sums to integrals. The first polynomial is a sawtooth function.

Strictly these functions are not polynomials at all and more properly should be termed the periodic Bernoulli functions, and is not even a function, being the derivative of a sawtooth and so a Dirac comb.

The following properties are of interest, valid for all formula_83:
* formula_84 is continuous for all formula_85
* formula_86 exists and is continuous for formula_87
* formula_88 for formula_87

<doc id="228165" wikidata="Q4686372" url="?curid=228165" title="Advancement and recognition in Scouting America">
<text>Advancement and recognition in Scouting America is a tradition dating from the inception of the Scouting movement. A fundamental purpose of advancement is the self-confidence a young man or woman acquires from his participation in Scouting. Advancement is one of the methods used in the &quot;Aims and Methods of Scouting&quot;– character development, citizenship training and personal fitness.

There are separate advancement and recognition programs for the main program divisions: Cub Scouting (ages six through 10), Scouts BSA (formerly Boy Scouting) (11–17), Venturing (14–20), and Sea Scouting (14–20) (and, formerly, through the now discontinued Varsity Scouting (14–18)). Each program is designed for its age group and goals.

== Cub Scouting ==

Scouting uses eight methods to fulfill its aims of character development, citizenship training, leadership, and physical fitness. Advancement is one of the eight methods. Cub Scouts use activities call Adventures to earn promotion, following a three step process of: preparation, qualification, and recognition. Cub Scouting is designed to function around the traditional school year with the goal of earning advancement by the end of the year. Youth participate in Cub Scouting from age 5 to 10, working through Lion, Bobcat, Tiger, Wolf, Bear, Webelos, and Arrow of Light.

In addition to the Adventures used to earn promotion, Cub Scouts can work to earn multiple other individual awards though participation in special programs, many of which happen during the summer time. These include Outdoor Activity Award, Shooting Sports Award, World Conservation Award, National Summer Time Pack Award, Whittling Chip (For Bears and Webelos), Cyber-chip, Interpreter Strip, Messenger of Peace, Nova and Supernova, Recruiter Strip, Religious Emblems, and Service Stars.

== Scouts BSA ==

=== Advancement in Scouts BSA ===
The advancement program for Scouting America (formerly known as Scouts BSA) has two phases. The first phase of Scout to First Class is designed to teach the Scoutcraft skills, how to participate in a group and to learn self-reliance. Scout is the joining rank, and is awarded when the Scout demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals. Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class have progressively harder requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and Scout Spirit.

Focus turns toward individual achievement, leadership and community service once First Class is earned. The ranks of Star, Life and Eagle require a set number of merit badges (minimum of 21 for Eagle Scout, with 13 from a compulsory list), as well as a minimum of time spent in a troop leadership position, and community service requirements, among other things. The rank of Eagle Scout requires the Scout plan, develop and lead their own service project that benefits their community or an organization other than Scouting. In 2010, the Life Scout rank added a specific teaching requirement, where a Star-rank Scout must teach a younger Scout certain requirements for one of the early ranks.

Several religious emblems programs are administered by various religious institutions and recognized by Scouting America. These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot. Many other advancement and recognitions—such as the 50-Miler Award, Aquatics Awards, Outdoor Ethics Awards, Crime Prevention Award, Emergency Preparedness Award and World Conservation Award —are available to Scouts who show performance in special areas.

Scouts may earn the Den Chief Service Award for their service as a Cub Scout Den Chief.

There are also several positions of responsibility within each troop, which is usually divided into patrols, with patrol leaders and assistant patrol leaders. The troop itself has a senior patrol leader as its youth leader, along with an assistant senior patrol leader, and several other positions of responsibility, such as scribe, quartermaster, librarian, instructor, historian and chaplain&#x27;s aide. Holding some sort of responsibility in the troop is a requirement for higher advancement ranks.

=== Order of the Arrow ===
The Order of the Arrow (OA) is Scouting America&#x27;s national honor society for experienced campers, based on American Indian traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service.

Awards are separate and distinct from the membership levels of Ordeal and Brotherhood. Awards available through the Order of the Arrow include: Vigil Honor, Founder&#x27;s Award, Distinguished Service Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Red Arrow Award, E. Urner Goodman Camping Award, E. Urner Goodman, Scholarship Fund, National Service Award. Scholastic awards are also available to Arrowmen to aid in education expenses.

== Varsity Scouting ==

Advancement was a key part of the Varsity program. Varsity Scouts could earn any award or recognition that were available to Boy Scouts, including merit badges, ranks advancements, and other awards. There were also several awards that were only available to Varsity Scouts, and sometimes their leaders. Due to the decision by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to cease participation in the Varsity Scouting program, the Boy Scouts of America decided to end the Varsity Scouting program, effective January 1, 2018.

== Venturing ==

=== Youth advancement ===

A Bronze Award may be earned for each category of arts and hobbies, outdoor, community and religious life, sea Scouting and sports. After earning at least one Bronze Award and meeting tenure, leadership, personal growth and other requirements the Venturer may earn the Gold Award. To earn the Silver Award, the Venturer must earn the Gold Award, earn first aid and CPR certifications, show leadership and participate in ethics training.

Venturers may also earn expert awards that build on some areas of the Bronze Awards.
These include the Venturing Ranger Award (Outdoors);
the TRUST Award (Community and Religious Life);
the Quest Award (Sports);
and the Quartermaster Award (Sea Scouting).

Male members under the age of 18 may also earn Merit Badges and the Star, Life, and Eagle Scout ranks from the Boy Scouting program if they have earned at least First Class rank in a Boy Scout troop or Varsity Scout team.

=== Venturing Leadership Award ===

Both youth and adults are eligible for the Venturing Leadership Award. There are three levels of these awards: council (for those at the crew, district, and/or council levels), region (for those at the area or region levels) and National. A limited number of these awards are presented on an annual basis to those involved in Venturing who have made exceptional contributions to Venturing at their particular level and who exemplify the Venturing Code. These awards are similar in scope to the Silver Beaver Award, Silver Antelope Award, and Silver Buffalo Award.

== Sea Scouting ==
In Sea Scouts, the traditional advancement program consists of the 4 ranks in the following order Apprentice, Ordinary, Able, and finally Quartermaster. Quartermaster is the highest Sea Scout Rank and is equivalent to Eagle Scout or Venturing Silver Award.

SEAL Training, (Sea Scout Experience Advanced Leadership Training ), is the highest level of Leadership Training. The program originated in 1996 and at the time was under the name of Sea Exploring, however in 1998 when Venturing was formed the organization was known as Sea Scouts. The name SEAL training did not change. There are about 4-6 course per year held around the country. Participants age over 14.5 to less than 18 years old. Participants must have earned the rank of Ordinary before attending the course. Approximately 80% of participants pass the course. The course is similar to NAYLE or what was previously known as NJLIC. Upon successful graduation from the course the student may wear the SEAL Pin on their uniform. This is the only youth earned pin that an Adult may wear.

Sea Scouts may choose to earn any Venturing awards, advancement, and training if they wish to. A male Sea Scout who has earned the rank of 1st Class in a Boy Scout Troop may complete further Boy Scout ranks and training from within his Sea Scout Ship.

== Outdoor Code ==
Since March 1954, the &quot;Outdoor Code&quot; has represented the core teachings of &quot;Scouting&#x27;s Outdoor Ethics&quot; and serves as both a goal and a promise:
As an American, I will do my best to –&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Be clean in my outdoor manners.&lt;br&gt;
Be careful with fire.&lt;br&gt;
Be considerate in the outdoors.&lt;br&gt;
Be conservation minded.&lt;br&gt;
== Lifesaving and meritorious action awards ==
BSA&#x27;s &quot;National Court of Honor&quot; is responsible for lifesaving and meritorious awards. All Courts of Honor for Eagle Scout rank are convened as National Courts of Honor also.

;Honor Medal With Crossed Palms
:A lifesaving award presented to a registered BSA member (youth or adult leader) who has demonstrated both unusual heroism and extraordinary skill or resourcefulness in saving or attempting to save a life at extreme risk to self; may be awarded posthumously.
;Honor Medal
:A lifesaving award presented to a registered BSA member (youth or adult leader) who has demonstrated unusual heroism in saving or attempting to save a life at considerable risk to self.
;Heroism Award
:A lifesaving award presented to a registered BSA member (youth or adult leader) who has demonstrated heroism and skill in saving or attempting to save life at minimal personal risk.
;Medal of Merit
:Awarded to BSA members (youth or adult leaders) who have performed an outstanding act of service and exceptional character by putting into practice Scouting skills and ideals. It does not need to involve risk to self.
;National Certificate of Merit
:This award may be presented by the National Court of Honor to a registered BSA member (youth or adult leader) who has performed a significant act of service that is deserving of special national recognition. Such action need not involve attempts of rescue or risk to self, but puts into practice Scouting skills or ideals.
;Local Council Certificate of Merit (No. 606760)
:This may be awarded by local BSA councils for individual meritorious actions by a registered BSA member (youth or adult leader) that do not merit national recognition.

== Nova and Supernova Awards ==
These STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) awards are for all three levels of youth scouting. Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers may all earn up to four Nova awards, each based on one of the four STEM principles. The Supernova award is a culmination of the youth&#x27;s work on the Nova award and there are a number of various Supernova awards that the scout may earn.

== Adult leader awards ==
=== Cub Scout leader recognition ===
Cub Scout leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Cub Scout Den Leader Training Award is available for Den Leaders, the Scouter&#x27;s Training Award is for any registered Cub Scout leader, and the Scouter&#x27;s Key and Unit Leader Award of Merit are for Cubmasters.

<doc id="228169" wikidata="Q3899058" url="?curid=228169" title="Penis Envy (album)">
<text>Penis Envy, released in 1981, was the third LP by the anarchist punk band Crass. The album was included at #36 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;40 Greatest Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list in 2016.

The &quot;Crassical Collection&quot; version of this release, including new artwork by Gee Vaucher, remastered sound, liner notes by Eve Libertine and Penny Rimbaud and bonus material, was released in November 2010.

==Background and release==
Named as a reference to some of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s ideas concerning sexuality, this release marked something of a departure from the hardcore image that &quot;The Feeding of the 5000&quot; and its follow up, &quot;Stations of the Crass&quot;, had to some extent given the group, for it featured more obviously complex musical arrangements, as well as exclusively female vocals by Eve Libertine and Joy De Vivre (although Steve Ignorant remained a group member and is credited on the record sleeve as &quot;not on this recording&quot;). The album addressed feminist issues and once again attacked the institutions of &#x27;the system&#x27; such as marriage and sexual repression.

One track, not actually listed on the album cover, was a deliberately saccharine (described in fact by the band themselves as &quot;pure, unadulterated shit&quot;) parody of a &quot;middle of the road&quot; love song entitled &quot;Our Wedding&quot;. This was given away as a flexi disc with a teenage girl&#x27;s romance magazine called &quot;Loving&quot; after having been offered it by an organisation calling itself Creative Recording And Sound Services (a backronym of Crass). A minor tabloid furore erupted once the hoax was revealed, with the &quot;News of the World&quot; going so far as to state that the album&#x27;s title was &quot;too obscene to print&quot;. (A leaflet giving the background to this Situationist-style prank was subsequently issued by the band). Now considered a rarity, the original flexi-disc fetches high prices on the collectors&#x27; market.

The album was banned by the retailer HMV. During the mid-1980s, Greater Manchester Police under the direction of James Anderton seized copies along with other records by Crass and the Dead Kennedys, from Eastern Bloc record shop. Frank Schofield was charged with displaying &quot;obscene articles for publication for gain&quot;. The band Flux of Pink Indians, its two record labels and its publishing company were also charged under the Obscene Publications Act. The judge ruled against Crass in the ensuing court case, although this decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal, apart from the lyrics to one song, &quot;Bata Motel&quot;. The heavy costs incurred by this episode were a contributing factor in Crass deciding to disband.

<text>Vipāka (Sanskrit and Pāli) is a Jain and Buddhist term for the ripening or maturation of &quot;karma&quot; (Pāli &quot;kamma&quot;), or intentional actions. The theory of karmic action and result (&quot;kamma-vipāka&quot;) is a central belief within the Buddhist tradition.

==Alternate translations==
The term &quot;vipaka&quot; is translated as:
* effect (Ven. D. Mahinda Thera)
* maturation (Keown, 2000, loc 810–813)
* ripening (Harvey, 1990, p. 39)
* result
This is the meaning given for &quot;Vipaka&quot; in tipitaka.lk / dictionary: please find text copied from it directly, given below
Vipaka (විපාක) :පු ඵලය, විපාකය, ආනිසංසය.
විපාක
ND&#x27;kamma-result&#x27;, is any kammically (morally) neutral mental phenomenon (e.g. bodily agreeable or painful feeling, sense-consciousness, etc. ), which is the result of wholesome or unwholesome volitional action (kamma, q.v.) through body, speech or mind, done either in this or some previous life. Totally wrong is the belief that, according to Buddhism, everything is the result of previous action. Never, for example, is any kammically wholesome or unwholesome volitional action the result of former action, being in reality itself kamma. On this subject s. titthāyatana, kamma, Tab. I; Fund II. Cf. A. III, 101; Kath. 162 (Guide, p. 80).

Kamma-produced (kammaja or kamma-samuṭṭhāna) corporeal things are never called kamma-vipāka, as this term may be applied only to mental phenomena.
(Vipaka)විපාක PTS [fr. vi+pac] fruit, fruition, product; always in pregnant meaning of &quot;result, effect, consequence (of one&#x27;s action),&quot; either as good &amp; meritorious (;kusala or bad &amp; detrimental (;akusala).

<doc id="228180" wikidata="Q486690" url="?curid=228180" title="Hideo Nomo">
<text>is a Japanese former baseball pitcher who played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and Major League Baseball (MLB). He achieved early success in his native country, where he played with the Kintetsu Buffaloes from to . He then exploited a loophole to free himself from his contract, and became the first Japanese major leaguer to permanently relocate to MLB in the United States, debuting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in . Although he was not the first Japanese player in American professional baseball, Nomo is often credited with opening the door for Japanese players in MLB, due to his star status.

Nomo pitched over a span of 13 seasons in the American major leagues with eight different teams, before retiring in . In 1995, he won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award and was named an MLB All-Star. He twice led MLB in strikeouts and also threw two no-hitters, including the first No-Hitter in Coors Field history, a ballpark notoriously hard to pitch in due to elevation from sea level affecting pitched and batted balls. He was the only Japanese pitcher in MLB to throw a no-hitter until the Seattle Mariners&#x27; Hisashi Iwakuma did so on August 12, 2015, against the Baltimore Orioles.

Nomo was well known for his distinctive &quot;tornado&quot; pitching windup and delivery. In 2014, Nomo was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame. He currently resides in Los Angeles, California.

==Early life==
Nomo was born in Minato-ku, Osaka, Japan, into the working-class family of Shizuo, a fisherman and postal worker, and Kayoko, a part-time supermarket employee. As a youth, Nomo was shy and withdrawn, although passionate about baseball. He developed his corkscrew-style pitching motion in order to impress his father while playing catch. He believed that rotating from having his back turned to his target would help him add speed to his pitches.

Nomo graduated from Seijo Industrial High School in Osaka where he grew to and . However, he was not selected in the Nippon Professional Baseball draft due to issues with his control. Instead, in 1988, Nomo joined Shin-Nittetsu Sakai, an Industrial League team representing Nippon Steel&#x27;s branch in Sakai, Osaka. During this time, Nomo slept with a tennis ball taped between his fingers in order to perfect his forkball grip.

==Professional career==
Nomo honed his forkball and his control while pitching in the Industrial League. At the 1988 Summer Olympics, Nomo played for the silver medal-winning Japanese baseball team.

===Kintetsu Buffaloes===
The Kintetsu Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) drafted him in . Nomo debuted with them in 1990 and was an immediate success, going 18–8 but more impressively striking out 287 hitters in just 235 innings. The strikeout numbers were attributed to his unorthodox wind-up, where he turned his back to the hitter, raised his pivot leg, and paused for a second before throwing. The delivery increased his pitch speed and made it more difficult for batters to spot the ball coming out of his hand. The windup gave him the nickname &quot;Tornado&quot;. Nomo won the Triple Crown that year.

In his first four seasons, Nomo was as consistent, and consistently good, as any pitcher in Japanese baseball, winning 17 or 18 games each year. His fifth season in 1994 was marred by a shoulder injury and netted him only eight wins. Nomo&#x27;s forkball became famous for being unpredictable for hitters and catchers alike.

Nomo had become one of the most popular baseball players in Japan but after the 1994 season, Nomo got into a contract dispute with team management. The Buffaloes rebuffed Nomo&#x27;s demands to have a contract agent and multi-year contract. Because he was drafted by Kintetsu, the Buffaloes retained exclusive rights to Nomo; however, Nomo&#x27;s agent, Don Nomura, found a loophole in the Japanese Uniform Players Contract to enable him to become a free agent. The &quot;voluntary retirement clause&quot; allowed a player who retired to play for whomever he wished after returning to active status. This led to him heading to the U.S., where in February 1995, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Nomo made his U.S. pro baseball debut with the Bakersfield Blaze on April 27, 1995, against the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. Placed on a 90-pitch limit, and throwing mainly fastballs, Nomo pitched innings, taking the 2–1 loss against the Quakes. On May 2, after a month in the minors necessitated by a player&#x27;s strike, he became the first Japanese-born Major Leaguer to appear in a game since Masanori Murakami in . He was also the first Japanese-born player to relocate permanently to the American major leagues, as Murakami played only two seasons with the San Francisco Giants and then returned to the Japanese major leagues for the remainder of his career. The pressure on Nomo would be tremendous, and Japanese media and fans appeared in large numbers in games he started. Nomo&#x27;s games were regularly broadcast live to Japan, despite the fact most people would be waking up when he started games.

The tornado delivery that baffled batters in Japan had the same effect on major league hitters, and he led the league in strikeouts in 1995 (while finishing second in walks) and was second with a 2.54 ERA. He struck out 11.101 batters per 9 innings to break Sandy Koufax&#x27;s single-season franchise record of 10.546 in . He also started that year&#x27;s All-Star Game, striking out three of the six batters he faced. He topped out at 93 mph in that game. Nomo was named NL Rookie of the Year honors that year over future Hall of Famer Chipper Jones. Nomo had another fine season in which was capped by a no-hitter thrown on September 17 in the unlikeliest of places, Denver&#x27;s Coors Field, a notorious hitters&#x27; park because of its high elevation, semi-arid climate, and lack of foul territory. Nomo&#x27;s no-hitter remains the only one in Coors Field, and he was the last Dodger to throw a no-hitter until Josh Beckett completed one on May 25, 2014.

As batters caught on to his delivery, his effectiveness waned a bit in , although he still went 14–12, joining Dwight Gooden as the only other pitcher to strike out at least 200 batters in each of his first three seasons.

===1998–2000===
Nomo pitched poorly in , starting the season 2–7, and was dealt to the New York Mets. His performance did not improve and he was released that season. In , he signed with the Chicago Cubs and made three starts for their Triple-A minor league team before refusing to make further starts in the minors, and received a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, where he went 12–8 with a 4.54 ERA. He reached the 1,000 strikeout mark in 1999, the third fastest in major league history. The Brewers waived him after contract issues and the Philadelphia Phillies claimed him, then granted him free agency only 24 hours later after more contract issues. Finally signed by the Detroit Tigers in , he went 8–12 with a 4.74 ERA and was again released.

===2001–2003===
Nomo signed with the Boston Red Sox in and started the season in spectacular fashion, throwing his second no-hitter in his Sox debut, on April 4, against the Baltimore Orioles, walking three and striking out 11. This no-hitter was the first in the 10-year history of Oriole Park at Camden Yards and made Nomo the first Red Sox to pitch a no-hitter since Dave Morehead in . Nomo also became just the fourth player in baseball history to have thrown a no-hitter in both leagues (joining Cy Young, Jim Bunning and Nolan Ryan. Randy Johnson later joined them, becoming the fifth player after throwing a perfect game in 2004). It was the earliest, calendar-wise, that a Major League Baseball no-hitter had been pitched until Ronel Blanco of the Houston Astros threw a no-hitter on April 1, 2024. Nomo also led the league in strikeouts for the first time since his first season in MLB.

A free agent after the end of the year, Nomo returned to the Dodgers in . He had his best season since 1996, posting a 16–6 record, 193 strikeouts, and 3.39 ERA. The following year, he had another strong season, going 16–13 with 177 K and a 3.09 ERA. During September , however, he began to exhibit signs of injury and fatigue.

===2004–2008===

Nomo began to struggle again in . After undergoing shoulder surgery in October 2003, he was benched after going 4–11 with an 8.25 ERA for the Dodgers (the worst ERA in the history of baseball for a player with at least 15 decisions in a season).

Before the start of spring training for , he signed a $800,000 contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The contract also included a $700,000 incentive that kicked in if Nomo started 20 games. The stipulation was allegedly included because Devil Rays upper management was unsure if Nomo had fully recovered from his injury. After a poor start in which he posted a 7.24 ERA, he was released on July 25. Coincidentally or not, this was two days before he was slated to make his twentieth major league start. On July 27, Nomo was picked up off waivers by the New York Yankees, who signed him to a minor league contract, but never recalled him. Nomo was signed to a minor league contract by the Chicago White Sox during spring training in to play for the Triple-A Charlotte Knights of the International League, but the White Sox released him on June 7 of that year.

In , Nomo signed on with the Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Winter League, managed by his former catcher, Carlos Hernández. His participation in the Venezuelan league was viewed as a first step toward an eventual Major League comeback. He made his debut on October 20, 2007, against Tiburones de La Guaira. Nomo pitched one inning, allowing one hit and no runs.

On January 4, , Nomo signed a minor league contract for 2008 with the Kansas City Royals. If added to the roster Nomo would have received a $600,000 one-year contract and the chance to earn $100,000 in performance bonuses. On April 5, his contract was bought by the Royals, and he was added to the 25-man roster. On April 10, Nomo made his first major league appearance since 2005, facing the New York Yankees in relief to start the seventh inning of a game the Yankees were leading 4–1. Nomo loaded the bases, but was able to retire his countryman Hideki Matsui to strand all three runners. But he surrendered back-to-back homers to Alex Rodriguez and Jorge Posada in the ninth inning. On April 20, Nomo was designated for assignment. The Royals released him on April 29. On July 17, Nomo officially retired from Major League Baseball.

Nomo earned 123 wins in the Major Leagues and 78 in Japan, winning his 200th overall game on June 15, 2005. Nomo&#x27;s success helped inspire other stars from Japan such as Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui, and Daisuke Matsuzaka to come over to the States as well. In addition, Nomo is one of only five players to pitch at least one no-hitter in both the National League and American League in Major League Baseball history. He has, to date, thrown the only no-hitters at Oriole Park at Camden Yards and at Coors Field.

==Post-playing career==
Nomo was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014, only the third ever to be selected in their first year of eligibility. At the time, he was also the youngest player ever elected to that Hall of Fame, although his record was broken in 2018 by Hideki Matsui.

Prior to the 2016 season, the San Diego Padres hired Nomo as Advisor for Baseball Operations, to assist the club with player development and expand their international profile. David Bednar has said that he learned his splitter from Nomo.

==Playing style==
With an overhand delivery, Nomo threw a fastball topping out at 95 mph and a forkball as his primary pitches.

Nomo was known for his signature windup, known as &quot;The Tornado&quot;. He began by slowly raising his arms high above his head before lifting his front leg and twisting his torso until his back faced home plate. Then, he hurtled toward the plate with an explosive delivery that featured the same arm speed for all his pitches.

==In popular culture==
During his time with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Nomo found commercial success in the States. He had a signature sneaker, the Air Max Nomo, produced by Nike in 1996. Also, he appeared on a Segata Sanshiro commercial for the Sega Saturn in 1997.

A song about Nomo, &quot;There&#x27;s No One Like Nomo&quot; performed by Jack Sheldon, written by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman, was released by GNP Crescendo Records (GNPD 1406) in 1996.

Nomo has been referenced in hip-hop lyrics by rappers such as Pusha T and Wale.

Professional wrestler Mitsuhide Hirasawa adopted the ring name Hideo Saito, partially in homage to Nomo.

In the Japanese dub of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; episode &quot;Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village&quot;, when Pidgeotto blows the stadium away, James makes a reference to Nomo, who was playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers at the time of the episode&#x27;s initial airing.

<text>Charles Alfred Coulson (13 December 1910 – 7 January 1974) was a British applied mathematician and theoretical chemist.

Coulson&#x27;s major scientific work was as a pioneer of the application of the quantum theory of valency to problems of molecular structure, dynamics and reactivity. He was also a Methodist lay preacher, served on the World Council of Churches from 1962 to 1968, and was chairman of Oxfam from 1965 to 1971.

==Early life==
The parents of Charles Coulson and his younger twin brother John Metcalfe Coulson were educators who hailed from the Midlands. The twins were born when their father, Alfred, was principal of Dudley Technical College and superintendent of the Methodist Sunday School, and their mother Annie Sincere Hancock was Headmistress of Tipton Elementary School, close by. Coulson&#x27;s parents maintained a religious Methodist home.

When the Coulson brothers were 10, their father was appointed Superintendent of Technical Colleges for the South-West of England, and the family moved to Bristol. When Charles was 13 he was awarded a scholarship to Clifton College in Bristol, which placed a strong emphasis on science and mathematics.

Coulson&#x27;s academic success at Clifton earned him an Entrance Scholarship in Mathematics to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1928.

His brother John also excelled at school, and went on to become Professor of Chemical Engineering at Newcastle University, and author of a major series of texts on chemical engineering.

==The Cambridge years==
At Cambridge, Coulson first studied the Mathematics Tripos. He was awarded a College Senior Scholarship during his studies, and received a First Class in the university examinations in 1931. He continued to take the Physics Part II examination a year later, receiving another First. He was awarded several College and University prizes during his undergraduate days. Lord Rutherford, J. J. Thomson, A.S. Besicovitch, Sir Arthur Eddington, G.H. Hardy, J.E. Littlewood, F.P. Ramsey and Ebenezer Cunningham were amongst his teachers.

In 1932, Coulson started graduate work with R. H. Fowler but switched to Sir John Lennard-Jones, and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1936 for work on the electronic structure of methane. By this time, he had published 11 papers. He continued as a research Fellow at Cambridge for another two years.

Coulson was accredited as a lay preacher in 1929, but he said his religion was perfunctory until a particular event in 1930, which he described in a documented sermon that he gave the following year. His religious beliefs were influenced by the physicist Sir Arthur Eddington, the theologian Charles Raven and, in particular, by Alex(ander) Wood, Fellow of Emmanuel College, authority on acoustics and pacifist, and Labour parliamentary candidate.

On the social side, Eileen Florence Burrett was studying in Cambridge to become a school teacher when Charles was an undergraduate. They came together in meetings of the University Methodists. They married in 1938, and had four children, two boys and two girls.

==St. Andrews and Oxford before King&#x27;s==
In 1939, Coulson was appointed as senior lecturer in mathematics at University College, Dundee. Administratively, this was still part of the University of St. Andrews. Coulson was a conscientious objector during World War II. He carried a very heavy work load, teaching mathematics, physics and chemistry. E. T. Copson was head of department, on the main St. Andrews campus. Coulson collaborated with C. E. Duncanson at University College, London, brought George Stanley Rushbrooke from Cambridge and acted technically as his Ph.D. supervisor, and wrote the first edition of &quot;Waves&quot;.

In 1941 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1950 as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

In 1945, Coulson became a lecturer in physical chemistry at Oxford University, attached to University College and, concurrently, held a Fellowship awarded by Imperial Chemical Industries. Coulson&#x27;s students at Oxford included:
* H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins, later a professor at Cambridge, then Edinburgh.
* John Maddox, who went with Coulson to King&#x27;s College, London, turned to publishing and was knighted.
* Roy McWeeny, later, a professor at Sheffield and then Pisa.
* William E. (Bill) Moffitt, later on the Chemistry faculty at Harvard.

==King&#x27;s College, London==
In 1947, Coulson accepted a university chair in theoretical physics at King&#x27;s College, London. A news item in &quot;Nature&quot; described him as &quot;among the foremost workers in Great Britain on the wave-mechanical side of quantum theory&quot;. It extolled his breadth of interests that took in the action of radiation on bacteria and the theory of liquids and solutions, besides the molecular orbital treatment of small molecules and ions, the approximation methods needed for large organic molecules for studies of bond lengths in coronene and conductivity of graphite, chemical reactivity, the treatment of momentum distribution functions and Compton-line profiles and his &quot;well deserved reputation for his kindly and helpful encouragement of younger research workers.&quot;

Initially, Coulson&#x27;s group were assigned offices on the top floor of a building (reached by a rickety wooden staircase) that overlooked the Strand, with considerable benefit when cavalcades paraded by on Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day and Royal occasions. In 1952, the group moved down to offices in the new Physics Department, interspersed with Biophysics and other experimental groups. With developments in computing opening new vistas for the theoreticians, along with the developments in laboratory methods, the entire department enjoyed the intellectual ferment of the 1950s.

In his account of the official opening of the new Physics Department, Maurice Wilkins wrote: &quot;the theoretical group deals with applications of wave mechanics and statistical mechanics ... the theory of the chemical bond ... questions of chemical reactivity ... stability of crystal structures, biological properties of cancer-producing compounds and other molecules, electrical and magnetic properties of metals, ... properties of electrolytes and colloidal solutions, including ... electrophoresis ... more than one hundred papers have been published during the past five years.&quot;

Coulson&#x27;s group consisted of (1) graduate students who conducted research on electronic structure and valence theory, for a Ph.D. degree directly under Coulson&#x27;s supervision, (2) students working for a Ph.D. in statistical thermodynamics under the supervision of Fred Booth and, later, in nuclear physics supervised by Louis Elton and then Dr. Percy, (3) students working for an M.Sc. on topics in applied mathematics to be followed by a Ph.D. with another supervisor in the Mathematics Department, and (4) visitors, some of whom held senior academic and industrial appointments. The valence theory Ph.D. students included Simon J. Altmann, Michael P Barnett, Aagje Bozeman, Peter J. Davies, Harry H. Greenwood, Peter Higgs, Julianne Jacobs, Roland Lefebvre, George Lester, John Maddox, Norman H. March, and Robert Taylor. Statistical mechanics was pursued by Geoffrey V. Chester, John Enderby, Alec Gaines and Alan B. Lidiard. The students who went on to the Mathematics Department included Godfrey Lance, Eric Milner and Geoffrey Sewell. Collectively, these wrote nearly 30 books in later years. Visitors who stayed for months included Professor Inga Fischer-Hjalmars of the University of Stockholm, Dr. John van der Waals of Shell Oil, and Dr. Joop der Heer from the University of Amsterdam.

==Oxford after King&#x27;s==
In 1952, Coulson was appointed Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics and Fellow of Wadham College at the University of Oxford. The chair was held previously by E. A. Milne, the mathematician and astrophysicist, and Roger Penrose succeeded Coulson. His inaugural lecture expressed the following view of applied mathematics: &quot;an intellectual adventure in which are combined creative imagination and authentic canons of beauty and fitness; they combine to give us insight into the nature of that world of which we ourselves, and our minds, are part.&quot;

Coulson was active in the formation of the Mathematical Institute, and soon became its director. On the institute website Coulson is described as &quot;a man who packed into his life twice as much as any normal academic person ... he had a gift for lucid exposition and was ... indefatigable in his work, not only for science and mathematics, but also on behalf of people, whether black or white, young or old.&quot;

In 1972, Coulson was appointed to the newly created chair of theoretical chemistry.

==Books and journals==
Coulson wrote several books. &quot;Valence&quot;, first published in 1952, and also reissued posthumously, was the most influential. Coulson also wrote popular works on atomic and molecular structure:

* &quot;Waves&quot; (1941)
* &quot;Electricity&quot; (1948)
* &quot;The Place of Science as a Cohesive Force in Modern Society&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Christianity in an Age of science&quot; (1953)

Coulson was a founder member of the board of the journal &quot;Molecular Physics&quot; and its first editor.

==Religious and social activities==
Beside his scientific works, Coulson was a committed Christian, and served as a Methodist local preacher. He wrote &quot;Science, Technology and the Christian&quot; (1953) and &quot;Science and Christian Belief&quot; (1955), integrating his scientific and religious views. Coulson apparently coined the phrase God of the gaps. Coulson believed religious faith was essential for the responsible use of science. He was a pacifist and conscientious objector, but championed the development of nuclear energy. He encouraged scientists to help improve Third World food production. He was chairman of Oxfam from 1965 to 1971. Charles&#x27; widest religious impact on the general public was in his BBC broadcasts. In these, and in general interaction with people, he conveyed his religiosity in a gentle and sometimes humorous manner, for example, when he claimed in his inaugural lecture at King&#x27;s College, that he had received mail addressed to him as Professor of Theological Physics.

<text>Vanillin is an organic compound with the molecular formula . It is a phenolic aldehyde. Its functional groups include aldehyde, hydroxyl, and ether. It is the primary component of the extract of the vanilla bean. Synthetic vanillin is now used more often than natural vanilla extract as a flavoring in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals.

Vanillin and ethylvanillin are used by the food industry; ethylvanillin is more expensive, but has a stronger note. It differs from vanillin by having an ethoxy group (−O−CH2CH3) instead of a methoxy group (−O−CH3).

Natural vanilla extract is a mixture of several hundred different compounds in addition to vanillin. Artificial vanilla flavoring is often a solution of pure vanillin, usually of synthetic origin. Because of the scarcity and expense of natural vanilla extract, synthetic preparation of its predominant component has long been of interest. The first commercial synthesis of vanillin began with the more readily available natural compound eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol). Today, artificial vanillin is made either from guaiacol or lignin.

Lignin-based artificial vanilla flavoring is alleged to have a richer flavor profile than that from guaiacol-based artificial vanilla; the difference is due to the presence of acetovanillone, a minor component in the lignin-derived product that is not found in vanillin synthesized from guaiacol.

== Natural history ==
Although it is generally accepted that vanilla was domesticated in Mesoamerica and subsequently spread to the Old World in the 16th century, in 2019, researchers published a paper stating that vanillin residue had been discovered inside jars within a tomb in Israel dating to the 2nd millennium BCE, suggesting the possible cultivation of an unidentified, Old World-endemic &quot;Vanilla&quot; species in Canaan since the Middle Bronze Age. Traces of vanillin were also found in wine jars in Jerusalem, which were used by the Judahite elite before the city was destroyed in 586 BCE.

Vanilla beans, called &quot;tlilxochitl,&quot; were discovered and cultivated as a flavoring for beverages by native Mesoamerican peoples, most famously the Totonacs of modern-day Veracruz, Mexico. Since at least the early 15th century, the Aztecs used vanilla as a flavoring for chocolate in drinks called &quot;xocohotl&quot;.

== Synthetic history ==
Vanillin was first isolated as a relatively pure substance in 1858 by Théodore Nicolas Gobley, who obtained it by evaporating a vanilla extract to dryness and recrystallizing the resulting solids from hot water. In 1874, the German scientists Ferdinand Tiemann and Wilhelm Haarmann deduced its chemical structure, at the same time finding a synthesis for vanillin from coniferin, a glucoside of isoeugenol found in pine bark. Tiemann and Haarmann founded a company Haarmann and Reimer (now part of Symrise) and started the first industrial production of vanillin using their process (now known as the Reimer–Tiemann reaction) in Holzminden, Germany. In 1876, Karl Reimer synthesized vanillin (2) from guaiacol (1).
By the late 19th century, semisynthetic vanillin derived from the eugenol found in clove oil was commercially available.

Synthetic vanillin became significantly more available in the 1930s, when production from clove oil was supplanted by production from the lignin-containing waste produced by the sulfite pulping process for preparing wood pulp for the paper industry. By 1981, a single pulp and paper mill in Thorold, Ontario, supplied 60% of the world market for synthetic vanillin. However, subsequent developments in the wood pulp industry have made its lignin wastes less attractive as a raw material for vanillin synthesis. Today, approximately 15% of the world&#x27;s production of vanillin is still made from lignin wastes, while approximately 85% is synthesized in a two-step process from the petrochemical precursors guaiacol and glyoxylic acid.

Beginning in 2000, Rhodia began marketing biosynthetic vanillin prepared by the action of microorganisms on ferulic acid extracted from rice bran. This product, sold at USD$700/kg under the trademarked name Rhovanil Natural, is not cost-competitive with petrochemical vanillin, which sells for around US$15/kg. However, unlike vanillin synthesized from lignin or guaiacol, it can be labeled as a natural flavoring.

== Occurrence ==

Vanillin is most prominent as the principal flavor and aroma compound in vanilla. Cured vanilla pods contain about 2% by dry weight vanillin. Relatively pure vanillin may be visible as a white dust or &quot;frost&quot; on the exteriors of cured pods of high quality.

It is also found in &quot;Leptotes bicolor&quot;, a species of orchid native to Paraguay and southern Brazil, and the Southern Chinese red pine.

At lower concentrations, vanillin contributes to the flavor and aroma profiles of foodstuffs as diverse as olive oil, butter, raspberry, and lychee fruits.

Aging in oak barrels imparts vanillin to some wines, vinegar, and spirits.

In other foods, heat treatment generates vanillin from other compounds. In this way, vanillin contributes to the flavor and aroma of coffee, maple syrup, and whole-grain products, including corn tortillas and oatmeal.

==Chemistry==

===Natural production===
Natural vanillin is extracted from the seed pods of &quot;Vanilla planifolia&quot;, a vining orchid native to Mexico, but now grown in tropical areas around the globe. Madagascar is presently the largest producer of natural vanillin.
As harvested, the green seed pods contain vanillin in the form of glucovanillin, its β--glucoside; the green pods do not have the flavor or odor of vanilla. Vanillin is released from glucovanillin by the action of the enzyme β-glucosidase during ripening and during the curing process.

After being harvested, their flavor is developed by a months-long curing process, the details of which vary among vanilla-producing regions, but in broad terms it proceeds as follows:

First, the seed pods are blanched in hot water, to arrest the processes of the living plant tissues. Then, for 1–2 weeks, the pods are alternately sunned and sweated: during the day they are laid out in the sun, and each night wrapped in cloth and packed in airtight boxes to sweat. During this process, the pods become dark brown, and enzymes in the pod release vanillin as the free molecule. Finally, the pods are dried and further aged for several months, during which time their flavors further develop. Several methods have been described for curing vanilla in days rather than months, although they have not been widely developed in the natural vanilla industry, with its focus on producing a premium product by established methods, rather than on innovations that might alter the product&#x27;s flavor profile.

===Biosynthesis===

Although the exact route of vanillin biosynthesis in &quot;V. planifolia&quot; is currently unknown, several pathways are proposed for its biosynthesis. Vanillin biosynthesis is generally agreed to be part of the phenylpropanoid pathway starting with -phenylalanine, which is deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to form t-cinnamic acid. The &quot;para&quot; position of the ring is then hydroxylated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H/P450) to create &quot;p&quot;-coumaric acid. Then, in the proposed ferulate pathway, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase (4CL) attaches &quot;p&quot;-coumaric acid to coenzyme A (CoA) to create &quot;p&quot;-coumaroyl CoA. Hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) then converts &quot;p&quot;-coumaroyl CoA to 4-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate. This subsequently undergoes oxidation by the P450 enzyme coumaroyl ester 3’-hydroxylase (C3’H/P450) to give caffeoyl shikimate/quinate. HCT then exchanges the shikimate/quinate for CoA to create caffeoyl CoA, and 4CL removes CoA to afford caffeic acid. Caffeic acid then undergoes methylation by caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) to give ferulic acid. Finally, vanillin synthase hydratase/lyase (vp/VAN) catalyzes hydration of the double bond in ferulic acid followed by a retro-aldol elimination to afford vanillin. Vanillin can also be produced from vanilla glycoside with the additional final step of deglycosylation. In the past &quot;p&quot;-hydroxybenzaldehyde was speculated to be a precursor for vanillin biosynthesis. However, a 2014 study using radiolabelled precursor indicated that &quot;p&quot;-hydroxybenzaldehyde is not used to synthesise vanillin or vanillin glucoside in the vanilla orchids.

===Chemical synthesis===
The demand for vanilla flavoring has long exceeded the supply of vanilla beans. , the annual demand for vanillin was 12,000 tons, but only 1,800 tons of natural vanillin were produced. The remainder was produced by chemical synthesis. Vanillin was first synthesized from eugenol (found in oil of clove) in 1874–75, less than 20 years after it was first identified and isolated. Vanillin was commercially produced from eugenol until the 1920s. Later it was synthesized from lignin-containing &quot;brown liquor&quot;, a byproduct of the sulfite process for making wood pulp. Counterintuitively, though it uses waste materials, the lignin process is no longer popular because of environmental concerns, and today most vanillin is produced from guaiacol. Several routes exist for synthesizing vanillin from guaiacol.

At present, the most significant of these is the two-step process practiced by Rhodia since the 1970s, in which guaiacol (1) reacts with glyoxylic acid by electrophilic aromatic substitution. The resulting vanillylmandelic acid (2) is then converted by 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglyoxylic acid (3) to vanillin (4) by oxidative decarboxylation.

===Wood-based vanillin===
15% of the world&#x27;s production of vanillin is produced from lignosulfonates, a byproduct from the manufacture of cellulose via the sulfite process. The sole producer of wood-based vanillin is the company Borregaard located in Sarpsborg, Norway.

Wood-based vanillin is produced by copper-catalyzed oxidation of the lignin structures in lignosulfonates under alkaline conditions and is claimed by the manufacturing company to be preferred by their customers due to, among other reasons, its much lower carbon footprint than petrochemically synthesized vanillin.

===Fermentation===
The company Evolva has developed a genetically modified microorganism which can produce vanillin. Because the microbe is a processing aid, the resulting vanillin would not fall under U.S. GMO labeling requirements, and because the production is nonpetrochemical, food using the ingredient can claim to contain &quot;no artificial ingredients&quot;.

Using ferulic acid as an input and a specific non GMO species of &quot;Amycolatopsis&quot; bacteria, natural vanillin can be produced.

===Biochemistry===
Several studies have suggested that vanillin can affect the performance of antibiotics in laboratory conditions.

== Uses ==

The largest use of vanillin is as a flavoring, usually in sweet foods. The ice cream and chocolate industries together comprise 75% of the market for vanillin as a flavoring, with smaller amounts being used in confections and baked goods.

Vanillin is also used in the fragrance industry, in perfumes, and to mask unpleasant odors or tastes in medicines, livestock fodder, and cleaning products. It is also used in the flavor industry, as a very important key note for many different flavors, especially creamy profiles such as cream soda.

Additionally, vanillin can be used as a general-purpose stain for visualizing spots on thin-layer chromatography plates. This stain yields a range of colors for these different components.

Vanillin–HCl staining can be used to visualize the localisation of tannins in cells.

Vanillin is becoming a popular choice for the development of bio-based plastics. 

===Manufacturing===
Vanillin has been used as a chemical intermediate in the production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other fine chemicals. In 1970, more than half the world&#x27;s vanillin production was used in the synthesis of other chemicals. As of 2016, vanillin uses have expanded to include perfumes, flavoring and aromatic masking in medicines, various consumer and cleaning products, and livestock foods.

== Adverse effects ==
Vanillin can trigger migraine headaches in a small fraction of the people who experience migraines.

Some people have allergic reactions to vanilla. They may be allergic to synthetically produced vanilla but not to natural vanilla, or the other way around, or to both.

Vanilla orchid plants can trigger contact dermatitis, especially among people working in the vanilla trade if they come into contact with the plant&#x27;s sap. An allergic contact dermatitis called vanillism produces swelling and redness, and sometimes other symptoms. The sap of most species of vanilla orchid which exudes from cut stems or where beans are harvested can cause moderate to severe dermatitis if it comes in contact with bare skin. The sap of vanilla orchids contains calcium oxalate crystals, which are thought to be the main causative agent of contact dermatitis in vanilla plantation workers.

A pseudophytodermatitis called vanilla lichen can be caused by flour mites (&quot;Tyroglyphus farinae&quot;).

== Ecology ==
&quot;Scolytus multistriatus&quot;, one of the vectors of the Dutch elm disease, uses vanillin as a signal to find a host tree during oviposition.

<text>A banyan, also spelled banian ( ), is a fig that develops accessory trunks from adjacent prop roots, allowing the tree to spread outwards indefinitely. This distinguishes banyans from other trees with a strangler habit that begin life as an epiphyte, i.e. a plant that grows on another plant, when its seed germinates in a crack or crevice of a host tree or edifice. &quot;Banyan&quot; often specifically denotes &quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot; (the &quot;Indian banyan&quot;), which is the national tree of India, though the name has also been generalized to denominate all figs that share a common life cycle and used systematically in taxonomy to denominate the subgenus Urostigma.

==Characteristics==
Like other fig species, banyans also bear their fruit in the form of a structure called a &quot;syconium&quot;. The syconium of &quot;Ficus&quot; species supply shelter and food for fig wasps and the trees depend on the fig wasps for pollination.

Frugivore birds disperse the seeds of banyans. The seeds are small, and because most banyans grow in woodlands, a seedling that germinates on the ground is unlikely to survive. However, many seeds fall on the branches and stems of other trees or on human edifices, and when they germinate they grow roots down toward the ground and consequently may envelop part of the host tree or edifice.
This is colloquially known as a &quot;strangler&quot; habit, which banyans share with a number of other tropical &quot;Ficus&quot; species, as well as some other unrelated genera such as &quot;Clusia&quot; and &quot;Metrosideros&quot;.

The leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy, green, and elliptical. Like most figs, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales abscise. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.

Older banyan trees are characterized by aerial prop roots that mature into thick, woody trunks, which can become indistinguishable from the primary trunk with age. These aerial roots can become very numerous. The Great Banyan of Kolkata, which has been tracked carefully for many years, currently has 2,880 supplementary trunks. Such prop roots can be sixty feet (eighteen meters) in height. Old trees can spread laterally by using these prop roots to grow over a wide area. In some species, the prop roots develop over a considerable area that resembles a grove of trees, with every trunk connected directly or indirectly to the primary trunk. The topology of this massive root system inspired the name of the hierarchical computer network operating system &quot;Banyan VINES&quot;.
In a banyan that envelops its host tree, the mesh of roots growing around the latter eventually applies considerable pressure to and commonly kills it. Such an enveloped, dead tree eventually decomposes, so that the banyan becomes a &quot;columnar tree&quot; with a hollow, central core. In jungles, such hollows are very desirable shelters to many animals.

From research, it is known that the longevity of banyan tree is due to multiple signs of adaptive (MSA) evolution of genes.

==Etymology==
The name was originally given to &quot;F. benghalensis&quot; and comes from India, where early European travelers observed that the shade of the tree was frequented by &quot;Banyans&quot; (a corruption of Baniyas, a community of Indian traders).

==Classification==
The original banyan, &quot;F. benghalensis&quot;, can grow into a giant tree covering several hectares. Over time, the name became generalized to all strangler figs of the &quot;Urostigma&quot; subgenus. The many banyan species also include:
* &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot;, which is native to Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, China, Taiwan, the Malay Archipelago, Mainland Southeast Asia, New Guinea, Australia, Ryukyu Islands and New Caledonia, is a significant invasive species elsewhere.
* The Central American banyan (&quot;Ficus pertusa&quot;) is native to Central America and northern South America, from southern Mexico south to Paraguay.
* The shortleaf fig (&quot;Ficus citrifolia&quot;) is native to South Florida, the Caribbean islands, Central America, and South America south to Paraguay. One theory is that the Portuguese name for &quot;F. citrofolia&quot;, &quot;os barbados&quot;, gave Barbados its name.
* The Florida strangler fig (&quot;Ficus aurea&quot;) is also native to South Florida and the Caribbean islands, and distinguished from the above by its coarser leaf venation.
* The Moreton Bay fig (&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot;) and Port Jackson fig (&quot;Ficus rubiginosa&quot;) are other related species.
==In horticulture==
Due to the complex structure of the roots and extensive branching, the banyan is used as a subject specimen in penjing and bonsai. The oldest living bonsai in Taiwan is a 240-year-old banyan tree housed in Tainan.

==In culture==

===Religion and mythology===
Banyan trees figure prominently in several Asian and Pacific religions and myths, including:
* In Hinduism, the leaf of the banyan tree is said to be the resting place for the god Krishna.
:In the Bhagavat Gita, Krishna said, &quot;There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.&quot; (Bg 15.1) Here the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside down. The branches go downward and the roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow of reality. In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can understand that there is substance and reality.
:Vat Purnima is a Hindu festival related to the banyan tree. Vat Purnima is observed by married women in North India and in the Western Indian states of Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat. During the three days of the month of Jyeshtha in the Hindu calendar (which falls in May–June in the Gregorian calendar) married women observe a fast and tie threads around a banyan tree and pray for the well-being of their husbands.
* In Buddhism&#x27;s Pali canon, the banyan (Pali: &quot;nigrodha&quot;) is referenced numerous times. Typical metaphors allude to the banyan&#x27;s epiphytic nature, likening the banyan&#x27;s supplanting of a host tree as comparable to the way sensual desire (&quot;kāma&quot;) overcomes humans.
* In Guam, the Chamorro people believe in tales of &quot;taotaomona&quot;, &quot;duende&quot;s, and other spirits.&quot; Taotaomona&quot; are spirits of the ancient Chamorro that act as guardians to banyan trees.
* In Vietnamese mythology of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the dark markings on the Moon are a banyan, a magical tree originally planted by a man named Cuội on Earth. When his wife watered it with unclean water, the tree uprooted itself with the man hanging on it and flew to the Moon, where he eternally accompanied the Moon Lady and the Jade Rabbit.
* In the Philippines, they are usually referred to as balete trees, which are home to certain deities and spirits.
* In Okinawa, the tree is referred to as gajumaru, which, according to traditional folklore, is the home for the mythical Kijimuna.

===Notable banyan trees===
* Thimmamma Marrimanu is a banyan tree in Anantapur, located circa from the town of Kadiri in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. It is recognized as the world&#x27;s largest banyan tree. It is present in the Indian Botanical Gardens and is more than 550 years old. Its canopy covers 
* One of the largest trees, the Great Banyan is found in Kolkata, India. Its canopy covers 
* Another such tree, Dodda Aalada Mara as in &quot;Big Banyan Tree&quot;, is found in the village of Ramohalli, on the outskirts of Bangalore, India; it has a spread of circa 2.5 acres.
* The Iolani Palace banyans in Honolulu, Hawaii. In the 1880s Queen Kapiolani planted two banyan trees within the Iolani Palace grounds. These trees have since grown into large groupings of trees on the old historic palace grounds.
* Maui, Hawaii has the Banyan tree in Lahaina planted by William Owen Smith on 24 April 1873, in Lahaina&#x27;s Courthouse Square to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the first American Protestant mission. It has grown to cover two-thirds of an acre. The tree was severely damaged by the 2023 Hawaii wildfires from 8–9 August which also severely damaged the town of Lahaina.
* One large banyan tree, Kalpabata, is inside the premises of Jagannath Temple in Puri. It is considered sacred by the devotees and is supposed to be more than 500 years old.
* A large banyan tree lives in Cypress Gardens, at the Legoland theme park located in Winter Haven, Florida. It was planted in 1939 in a 5-gallon bucket.
* Adayar Banyan Tree, located in the Theosophical Society Campus in Adayar, Chennai, India, is around 450 years old.
* The banyan tree from Miary, Madagascar which is said to be 1,700 years old.

===Other===
* The banyan tree is depicted in the coat of arms of Indonesia as a manifestation of the third principle of Pancasila (the unity of all of Indonesia). It is also used in the emblem of Golkar.
* &quot;The Economist &quot;magazine features an opinion column covering topics pertaining to Asia named &quot;Banyan&quot;.
* In southern Vanuatu, the clearings under banyan trees are used as traditional meeting places. The quarterly newsletter of the British Friends of Vanuatu Society is named &quot;Nabanga&quot;, after the local word for banyan.
* &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; is a notoriously difficult room in the 1984 ZX Spectrum platform game &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot;.
* The Foggy Swamp in &quot;&quot; consists of a single banyan grove tree.
* The title track from Steely Dan&#x27;s 1977 album Aja contains the lyric &quot;Chinese music under banyan trees, here at the dude ranch, above the sea.&quot;
* On 13 December 2021, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping personally intervened to punish and demote 10 CCP officials in Guangzhou after they cut down or uprooted thousands of banyan trees.
* During the age of sail, &#x27;Banyan&#x27; was used as an expression for a party, especially one at the fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle. This is likely due to religious festivals in India being held under the tree, of which East Indiamen would have been familiar.

<text>Ficus benghalensis, Ficus indica, or Ficus audrey commonly known as the [[banyan]], banyan fig and Indian banyan, is a tree native to the Indian Subcontinent. Specimens in India are among the largest trees in the world by canopy coverage. It is also known as a &quot;strangler fig&quot; because like many other trees in the genus &quot;Ficus&quot; it starts out as epiphyte, that is, leaning on another tree that it ends up suffocating.

==Description==
&quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot; is an evergreen, monoecious, fast-growing tree found mainly in monsoon and rainforests, that can reach a height of up to 30 meters. It is resistant to drought and mild frost. It produces propagating aerial roots that grow downward. Once these roots reach the ground, they take root and become supportive woody trunks.

The figs produced by the tree are eaten by birds such as the Indian myna. Fig seeds that have passed through the digestive system of birds are more likely to germinate than those that have not.

==Reproduction==

Banyan trees reproduce easily by seed or by stake, and they often spread from the original place by means of aerial roots that anchor in the ground and begin to grow and thicken to the point that they &quot;become independent&quot; from the original trunk, thus managing to &quot;emigrate&quot; sometimes at great distances. The figs are eaten by all kinds of frugivorous birds such as the coppersmith barbet and the common myna. Seeds that have passed through the digestive system of birds are more likely to germinate and grow faster.

Banyan seeds can fall and grow near a tree, sometimes from the very tree from which they come, and they also usually germinate in a hollow in a trunk or in a wall or rock. Gradually they begin to grow as they have plenty of support as epiphytes on any object they can use to climb in search of sunlight. Under normal conditions, the tree grows until it reaches a level where it gets the most sunlight, so its height can vary considerably. For this reason, where this tree predominates in a place, rather than growing in height, they spread on the surface, looking for the gaps that are left without vegetation. In general, the crown of this tree extends over a diameter well above its height.

==Cultural significance==
&quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot; is the national tree of India.

The tree is considered sacred in India, and temples are often built nearby. Due to the large size of the tree&#x27;s canopy, it provides useful shade in hot climates.

In Theravada Buddhism, this tree is said to have been used as the tree for achieved enlightenment, or Bodhi by the twenty fourth buddha called &quot;Kassapa - කස්සප&quot;. The sacred plant is known as &quot;Nuga - නුග&quot; or &quot;Maha nuga - මහ නුග&quot; in Sri Lanka.

It is the tree under which Adhinath the first Jain Tirthankara attained Kewal Gyan or spiritual enlightenment.

==Notable specimens==

The giant banyans of India are the largest trees in the world by area of canopy coverage. Notable individual trees include:
*Thimmamma Marrimanu
*Kabirvad
*The Great Banyan

The largest known tree in the world in terms of the two dimensional area covered by its canopy is Thimmamma Marrimanu in Andhra Pradesh, India, which covers . Its perimeter, , is also the gratest of any known tree.

Nearchus, an admiral of Alexander the Great, described a large specimen on the banks of the Narmada River in contemporary Bharuch, Gujarat, India; he may have described the tree presently named &quot;Kabirvad&quot;. The canopy of the tree that Nearchus described was said to be so extensive that it sheltered 7,000 men. James Forbes later described it in his &quot;Oriental Memoirs&quot; (1813–5) as almost in circumference and having more than 3,000 trunks. Currently its canopy has an area of and a perimeter of .

Other notable Indian specimens include The Great Banyan in the Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanic Garden in Shibpur, Howrah, which has a canopy area of and is about 250 years old, and Dodda Aladha Mara in Kettohalli, Karnataka, which has a canopy area of and is about 400 years old.

<doc id="228204" wikidata="Q112015" url="?curid=228204" title="Town Musicians of Bremen">
<text>The &quot;Town Musicians of Bremen&quot; () is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; in 1819 (KHM 27).

It tells the story of four ageing domestic animals, who after a lifetime of hard work are neglected and mistreated by their former masters. Eventually, they decide to run away and become town musicians in the city of Bremen. Contrary to the story&#x27;s title the characters never arrive in Bremen, as they succeed in tricking and scaring off a band of robbers, capturing their spoils, and moving into their house. It is a story of Aarne–Thompson Type 130 (&quot;Outcast animals find a new home&quot;).

== Origin ==
The Brothers Grimm first published this tale in the second edition of &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; in 1819, based on the account of the German storyteller Dorothea Viehmann (1755–1815).

==Synopsis==
In the story, a donkey, a dog, a cat, and a rooster, all past their prime years in life and usefulness on their respective farms, were soon to be discarded or mistreated by their masters. One by one, they leave their homes and set out together. They decide to go to Bremen, known for its freedom, to live without owners and become musicians there (&quot;Something better than death we can find anywhere&quot;).

On the way to Bremen, they see a lighted cottage; they look inside and see three robbers enjoying their ill-gotten gains. Standing on each other&#x27;s backs, they decide to scare the robbers away by making a din; the men run for their lives, not knowing what the strange sound is. The animals take possession of the house, eat a good meal, and settle in for the evening.

Later that night, the robbers return and send one of their members in to investigate. He sees the cat&#x27;s eyes shining in the darkness and thinks he is seeing the coals of the fire. The robber reaches over to light his candle. Things happen in quick succession; the cat scratches his face with her claws, the dog bites him on the leg, the donkey kicks him with his hooves, and the rooster crows and chases him out the door. The terrified robber tells his companions that he was beset by a horrible witch who had scratched him with her long fingernails (the cat), a dwarf who has a knife (the dog), a black monster who had hit him with a club (the donkey), and worst of all, a judge calling out from the rooftop (the rooster). The robbers abandon the cottage to the strange creatures who have taken it, where the animals live happily for the rest of their days.

In the original version of this story, which dates from the twelfth century, the robbers are a bear, a lion, and a wolf, all animals featured in heraldic devices. When the donkey and his friends arrive in Bremen, the townsfolk applaud them for having rid the district of the terrible beasts. An alternate version involves the animals&#x27; master(s) being deprived of his livelihood (because the thieves stole his money and/or destroyed his farm or mill) and having to send his or their animals away, unable to take care of them any further. After the animals dispatch the thieves, they take the ill-gotten gains back to their master so he can rebuild. Other versions involve at least one wild, non-livestock animal, such as a lizard, helping the domestic animals out in dispatching the thieves.

== Analysis ==
=== Tale type ===
The tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 130, &quot;The Animals in Night Quarters (Bremen Town Musicians)&quot;. Folklorists Stith Thompson and Barre Toelken see a deep relation between this type and type ATU 210, &quot;Cock (Rooster), Hen, Duck, Pin, and Needle on a Journey&quot;.

Folklorist Antti Aarne proposed an Asian origin for the tale type ATU 130, &quot;Die Tiere auf der Wanderschaft&quot; (&quot;Wandering Animals and Objects&quot;).

French folklorist Paul Delarue identified two forms of the tale type: a Western one, wherein the animals in exile are always domestic animals (represented by Grimm&#x27;s tale), and an Eastern one, wherein the characters are &quot;inferior animals&quot;. This second form is popular in Japan, China, Korea, Melanesia and Indonesia.

=== Variants ===

The story is similar to other AT-130 tales like the German/Swiss &quot;The Robber and the Farm Animals&quot;, the Norwegian &quot;The Sheep and the Pig Who Set Up House&quot;, the Finnish &quot;The Animals and the Devil&quot;, the Flemish &quot;The Choristers of St. Gudule&quot;, the Scottish &quot;The Story of the White Pet&quot;, the English &quot;The Bull, the Tup, the Cock, and the Steg&quot;, the Irish &quot;Jack and His Comrades&quot;, the Spanish &quot;Benibaire&quot;, the American &quot;How Jack Went to Seek His Fortune&quot; and &quot;The Dog, the Cat, the Ass, and the Cock&quot;, and the South African &quot;The World&#x27;s Reward&quot;.

Joseph Jacobs also cited this as a parallel version of the Irish &quot;Jack and His Comrades&quot;, and the English &quot;How Jack went to seek his fortune&quot;. Variants also appears in American folktale collections, and in Scottish Traveller repertoires.

Variants also appear in tale compilations from Indian, Malay and Japanese sources.

==Cultural legacy==
The tale has been retold through animated pictures, motion pictures (often musicals), theatre plays and operas.

===Screen and stage adaptations===
* In 1935, Ub Iwerks created &quot;The Brementown Musicians&quot; which was an adaptation made for Iwerk&#x27;s series of ComiColor Cartoons.
* Terrytoons released an adaption called &quot;The Hopeful Donkey&quot; in 1943, which added The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs to the story.
* German-U.S. composer Richard Mohaupt created the opera &quot;Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten&quot;, which premiered in Bremen 1949.
* The tale was adapted in humorous fashion for the British children&#x27;s series &quot;Wolves, Witches and Giants&quot; narrated by Spike Milligan, but with the action taking place in &#x27;Brum&#x27; (short for Birmingham) rather than Bremen.
* In the Soviet Union, the story was loosely adapted into an animated musical in 1969 by Yuri Entin and Vasily Livanov at the studio Soyuzmultfilm, &quot;The Bremen Town Musicians&quot;. It was followed by a sequel called &quot;On the Trail of the Bremen Town Musicians&quot;. In 2000, a second sequel was made, called &quot;The New Bremen Town Musicians&quot;.
* In 1972, Jim Henson produced a version with his Muppets called &quot;The Muppet Musicians of Bremen&quot;, set in the Louisiana countryside instead of Germany, where the original story took place.
* In 1976, in Italy, Sergio Bardotti and Luis Enríquez Bacalov adapted the story into a musical play called &quot;I Musicanti&quot;, which two years later was translated into Portuguese by the Brazilian composer Chico Buarque. The musical play was called &quot;Os Saltimbancos&quot;, was later released as an album, and became one of the greatest classics for children in Brazil. This version was also made into a film. 
* In Spain, the story inspired the animated feature film titled, &quot;Los 4 músicos de Bremen&quot; in 1989, directed by Cruz Delgado, a cartoonist and animation filmmaker, this being his last film. After gaining fame and recognition by winning the Goya Award for Best Animated Film, the animated television series &quot;Los Trotamúsicos&quot;, was aired with a total of 26 episodes. The synopsis follows the story of four animal friends: &quot;Koki&quot; the rooster, &quot;Lupo&quot; the dog, &quot;Burlón&quot; the cat and &quot;Tonto&quot; the donkey, who form a band in the playing respectively guitar, trumpet, saxophone and drums with the aim of winning a contest in the city of Bremen.
* Rik Mayall performed as a storyteller in British children&#x27;s television programme Grim Tales and told the story, which aired on 13th January 1991. The episode was directed by Bob Baldwin 
* In Japan, Tezuka Productions made a loose science fiction themed animated television film adaptation titled , which premiered in 1981. It revolves around an alien visiting Earth during a military invasion of a fictional Bremen and giving four animals based on the ones from the original tale a device that can transform them into humans. Despite being aimed at children, the film has a substantial amount of gun violence and depictions of war crimes, but its core theme is anti-war.
* In Germany and the United States, the story was adapted into an animated feature in 1997 under the title &quot;The Fearless Four&quot; (&quot;Die furchtlosen Vier&quot;), though it varied considerably from the source material; while the general plot is the same, the four arrive in Bremen and help to free it from the grasp of the corrupt corporation Mix Max, along with rescuing animals that the company plans to turn into sausage. It starred R&amp;B singer James Ingram as Buster the dog, guitarist B.B. King as Fred the donkey, singer and pianist Oleta Adams as Gwendolyn the cat and Italian musician Zucchero Fornaciari as Tortellini the Rooster in the English dub. 
* The obscure 1997 Dingo Pictures film, &quot;Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten&quot;, is a mockbuster of the aforementioned &quot;The Fearless Four&quot;.
* On Cartoon Network in between cartoon breaks during the &quot;Out of Tune Toons&quot; marathon and on Cartoonetwork Video, there are cartoon shorts (called &quot;Wedgies&quot;) of an animal garage band based on the tale called &quot;The Bremen Avenue Experience&quot; featuring a cat (Jessica), dog (Simon), donkey (Barret) and rooster (Tanner). They are either a modern adaptation of &quot;Town Musicians of Bremen&quot; or descendants of the old musicians of Bremen.
* The HBO Family animated series, &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot;, adapted this story in Season 3 and did a country/African-American twist on it featuring Jenifer Lewis as Hazel (the dog), Gladys Knight as Chocolate (the donkey), Dionne Warwick as Miss Kitty (the cat), and George Clinton as Scratchmo (the rooster).
* The 2020 Japanese tokusatsu series &quot;Kamen Rider Saber&quot; adopts the story as a &quot;Wonder Ride Book&quot; called , which is utilized by one of the protagonists, Kamen Rider Slash.
* The independent film production company Storybook Studio is in development of a new musical film adaptation of the poem, written and directed by John Patrick.
* The 2024 Netflix anime series &quot;The Grimm Variations&quot; retells the story as a science fiction Western, with human women with the names of the animals replacing the animals themselves. Ex-Deputy Sheriff &quot;Mad Dog&quot; forms a group with muscular foundry-worker Donkey and former prostitute Cat, who run a gang out of town with the help of a girl held hostage by the gang called Rooster.

===Literature===
* Richard Scarry wrote an adaptation of the story in his book &quot;Richard Scarry&#x27;s Animal Nursery Tales&quot; in 1975. In it, the donkey, dog, cat, and rooster set out as a musical band since they are bored with farming. This work was portrayed in a 1986 cartoon produced by Western Publishing.
* In the Japanese adventure game &quot;Morenatsu&quot;, the dog character Kōya is part of a rock band with three other performers, who are a cat, a bird, and a horse. The protagonist makes note of the resemblance to the Town Musicians of Bremen, with a brief monologue explaining the fairy tale.
* Carl Sommer adapted the story for his Sommer-Time Learning series of books. In Sommer&#x27;s adaptation, the animals help the Bremen police catch the robbers and are given the opportunity to actually be musicians in the end.
* In the comic &quot;Blacksad&quot;&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;A Silent Hell&quot;, a mystery unfolds in New Orleans around the remaining members of a defunct musical group formerly composed of a dog, a cat, a rooster, and a donkey, all of whom had migrated to the city from their home on a Southern island.
* In &quot;Black Clover&quot;, Nacht Faust is a host to four devils; Gimodelo, Plumede, Slotos and Walgner, a dog, a cat, a horse and rooster respectively.

===Music===
* In the early 20th century, the American folk/swing/children&#x27;s musician Frank Luther popularized the musical tale as the &quot;Raggletaggletown Singers&quot;, presented in children&#x27;s school music books and performed in children&#x27;s plays.
* &quot;The Musicians of Bremen&quot; (1972), based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, the &quot;Town Musicians of Bremen&quot;, for male voices: two countertenors, tenor, two baritones and bass; composed by Malcolm Williamson, and premiered by The King&#x27;s Singers in Sydney on 15 May 1972.
* In 2012, American artists PigPen Theatre Co. released their debut album titled &quot;Bremen&quot;, with the fifth track &quot;Bremen&quot;&#x27;s lyrics telling the story of the Town Musicians of Bremen.
* In 2015, Japanese rock musician Kenshi Yonezu released his third album titled &quot;Bremen&quot;, with the sixth track &quot;Will-O-Wisp&quot;&#x27;s lyrics being centred on the Town Musicians of Bremen.
*Also in 2015, radical Canadian musician Geoff Berner released the klezmer-punk album &quot;We Are Going to Bremen To Be Musicians&quot;, inspired by the tale. In the same year, Berner collaborated with artists Tin Can Forest in a comnic-book retelling of the tale.
* In 2022, Japanese pop group Yorushika released the single &quot;Bremen&quot; (ブレーメン) which features the Town Musicians of Bremen on the cover. The lyrics reference the Musicians and are loosely inspired by the fairy tale.

===Art and sculpture===

* Statues modeled after the Town Musicians of Bremen statue now reside in front of each of the five German veterinary schools. 
* Another replica of the statue can be found in the Lynden Sculpture Garden, located in Milwaukee.
* A persiflage of this tale can be found on the wall in the Fort Napoleon, Ostend, Belgium. Heinrich-Otto Pieper, a German soldier during World War I, painted the German and the Austro-Hungarian eagles throned on a rock, under the light of a Turkish crescent. They look with contempt on the futile efforts of the Town Musicians of Bremen to chase them away. These animals are symbols for the Allied Forces: on top the French cock, standing on the Japanese jackal, standing on the English bulldog, standing on the Russian bear. Italy is depicted as a twisting snake and Belgium a tricolored beetle.
* A sculpture in Riga shows the animals breaking through a wall (symbolising the Iron Curtain).
* A junction in Pune City of India has been named after Bremen as &#x27;Bremen Chowk&#x27; and has sculpture of instrument that four musicians had used.
* The city of Fujikawaguchiko in Japan has its own statue of the Town Musicians of Bremen.
* The City of Kawasaki in Japan has a Bremen Street that features a replica statue.

===Video games===
* In &quot;Super Tempo&quot;, the second stage is set in Bremen, and the player&#x27;s goal is to find and reunite the ghosts of the four deceased Town Musicians—referred to as &quot;The Bremens&quot;, akin to a band name—to perform a song.
* In &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, there is a musician playing a hurdy-gurdy who tells his story about how he was in a musical troupe run by animals. For listening to his tale, the player receives an item called the Bremen Mask (which allows the player to play a musical march on their ocarina, thus allowing the player to lead animals), which is a reference to the Town Musicians of Bremen.
* In &quot;Agatha Knife&quot;, there is an in-game quiz where the players are asked about the animals that make up the Town Musicians of Bremen, allowing them to go to the zoo for free.
* In &quot;Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier&quot;, the four members of the Orchestral Army are named Ezel, Katze, Henne, and Kyon—the German words for donkey, cat, and hen and the Greek word for dog, respectively. Their organization being called the Orchestral Army is a further reference to the story.
* In &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;, the Town Musicians of Bremen appear as NPCs in the &quot;Blood and Wine&quot; DLC.
* In &quot;&quot;, the card &quot;Musicians of Blaviken&quot; depicts the four animals balancing on each other.
* In &quot;Library of Ruina&quot;, there is a syndicate based on the Musicians of Bremen, with each of its original members representing a different animal from the story&#x27;s cast.
* Shari Lewis adapted the story in the computer game &quot;Lamb Chop Loves Music&quot;, replacing the donkey with a horse and Lamb Chop taking the place of the rooster. After fleeing the robbers&#x27; den, other animals join the group as they try to become musicians in Bremen.
* In &quot;The Sims 3&quot;, the item &quot;An Accumulation of Animals&quot; depicts the Musicians of Bremen stacked on one another.

===German Fairy Tale Route===
The sculpture of the Town Musicians of Bremen in Bremen, Germany, is the starting point of a tourist attraction, the German Fairy Tale Route (Deutsche Märchenstraße). The German Fairy Tale Route is a popular tourist attraction in Germany that celebrates the country&#x27;s rich heritage of fairy tales. Beginning in Hanau in Hesse, the birthplace of the Brothers Grimm, and ending in Bremen, the home of the famed Town Musicians of Bremen, this scenic route meanders through various landscapes that inspired many of the tales we still know and love today.

<text>Interbrew is subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV is based in Breda, Netherlands. It has one subsidiary, Ambev S.A. of São Paulo, Brazil.

==Brands==
Interbrew brands have historically included Budweiser, Stella Artois, Boddingtons, Beck&#x27;s, Staropramen, Bass and Leffe, although many have spun off to their own companies including Bass, which is now owned by Molson Coors.

==History==
Having its roots in Leuven(Belgium), Interbrew was formed in 1987 when &quot;Brouwerij Artois&quot;, the Flemish brewers of Stella Artois (established before 1366) merged with Walloon-based brewer Piedboeuf. International expansion began when Interbrew acquired the notable Canadian brand Labatt. The transaction also included Labatt&#x27;s assets, which included the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club, the Toronto Argonauts football club, and The Sports Network (the latter being immediately resold to NetStar Communications due to Canadian media ownership regulations).

In 2000, Interbrew acquired Bass and Whitbread in the UK. In December 2000, the company issued an IPO.

In 2001, the company entered Germany with the acquisition of Diebels and also acquired Beck&#x27;s &amp; Co. that year.

In 2004, Interbrew merged with Brazilian brewer AmBev to form InBev, becoming the largest brewer in the world by volume, with approximately 14% global market share. Before the merger with AmBev, Interbrew was the third largest in the world by volume, and AmBev was the fifth largest. In 2008, InBev further merged with American brewer Anheuser-Busch to form Anheuser-Busch InBev (abbreviated AB InBev). Interbrew became a division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV after the latter acquired SABMiller in October 2016.

<doc id="228211" wikidata="Q73622" url="?curid=228211" title="Futurama">
<text>Futurama is an American animated science fiction sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company and later revived by Comedy Central, and then Hulu. The series follows Philip J. Fry, who is cryogenically preserved for 1,000 years and revived on December 31, 2999. Fry finds work at the interplanetary delivery company Planet Express, working alongside the one-eyed mutant Leela and the robot Bender. The series was envisioned by Groening in the mid-1990s while working on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; he brought David X. Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.

Following its initial cancellation by Fox, &quot;Futurama&quot; began airing reruns on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim programming block, which lasted from 2003 to 2007. It was revived in 2007 as four direct-to-video films, the last of which was released in early 2009. Comedy Central entered into an agreement with 20th Century Fox Television to syndicate the existing episodes and air the films as 16 new, half-hour episodes, constituting a fifth season.

In June 2009, Comedy Central picked up the show for 26 new half-hour episodes, which began airing in 2010 and 2011. The show was renewed for a seventh season, with the first half airing in 2012 and the second in 2013. An audio-only episode featuring the original cast members was released in 2017 as an episode of &quot;The Nerdist Podcast&quot;. On February 9, 2022, Hulu revived the series with a 20-episode order, which premiered on July 24, 2023. In November 2023, the show was renewed by Hulu for two more broadcast seasons, which will air through 2026.

&quot;Futurama&quot; received critical acclaim throughout its run and was nominated for 17 Annie Awards, winning nine of them, and 12 Emmy Awards, winning six. It was nominated four times for a Writers Guild of America Award, winning for the episodes &quot;Godfellas&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner of Benda&quot;. It was nominated for a Nebula Award and received Environmental Media Awards for the episodes &quot;The Problem with Popplers&quot; and &quot;The Futurama Holiday Spectacular&quot;. Merchandise includes a tie-in comic book series, video games, calendars, clothes, and action figures. In 2013, TV Guide ranked &quot;Futurama&quot; one of the top 60 Greatest TV Cartoons of All Time.

==Premise==
===Characters===
&quot;Futurama&quot; is essentially a workplace sitcom, the plot of which revolves around the Planet Express interplanetary delivery company and its employees, a small group that largely fails to conform to future society. Episodes usually feature the central trio of Fry, Leela, and Bender, though occasional storylines center on the other main characters.

* Philip J. Fry (voiced by Billy West) – Fry is an immature, slovenly, yet good-hearted and sensitive pizza delivery boy who falls into a cryogenic pod, causing it to activate and freeze him just after midnight on January 1, 2000. He reawakens on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2999 and gets a job as a cargo delivery boy at Planet Express, a company owned by his only living relative, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth. Fry&#x27;s love for Leela is a recurring theme throughout the series.
* Turanga Leela (voiced by Katey Sagal) – Leela is the competent, one-eyed captain of the Planet Express Ship. Abandoned as a baby, she grows up in the Cookieville Minimum Security Orphanarium believing herself to be an alien from another planet, but learns that she is actually a mutant from the sewers in the episode &quot;Leela&#x27;s Homeworld&quot;. Prior to becoming the ship&#x27;s captain, Leela works as a career assignment officer at the cryogenics lab where she first meets Fry. She is Fry&#x27;s primary love interest and eventually becomes his wife. Her name is a reference to the &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot; by Olivier Messiaen.
* Bender Bending Rodriguez (voiced by John DiMaggio) – Bender is a foul-mouthed, heavy-drinking, cigar-smoking, kleptomaniacal, misanthropic, egocentric, ill-tempered robot manufactured by Mom&#x27;s Friendly Robot Company. He is originally programmed to bend girders for suicide booths, and is later designated as assistant sales manager and cook at Planet Express, despite lacking a sense of taste. He is Fry&#x27;s best friend and roommate. He must drink heavily to power his fuel cells and becomes the robot equivalent of drunk when low on alcohol.
* Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth (voiced by Billy West) – Professor Farnsworth, also known simply as &quot;the Professor&quot;, is Fry&#x27;s distant nephew, and technically descendant. Farnsworth founds Planet Express Inc. to fund his work as a mad scientist. Although he is depicted as a brilliant scientist and inventor, at more than 160 years old he is extremely prone to age-related forgetfulness and fits of temper. In the episode &quot;A Clone of My Own&quot;, the Professor clones himself to produce a successor, Cubert Farnsworth (voiced by Kath Soucie), whom he treats like a son.
* Hermes Conrad (voiced by Phil LaMarr) – Hermes is the Jamaican accountant of Planet Express. A 36th-level bureaucrat (demoted to level 37 during the series) and proud of it, he is a stickler for regulation and enamored of the tedium of paperwork and bureaucracy. Hermes is also a former champion in Olympic Limbo, a sport derived from the popular party activity. He gave up limbo after the 2980 Olympics when a young fan, imitating him, broke his back and died. Hermes has a wife, LaBarbara, and a 12-year-old son, Dwight.
* Dr. John A. Zoidberg (voiced by Billy West) – Zoidberg is a Decapodian, a lobster-like alien from the planet Decapod 10, and the neurotic staff physician of Planet Express. Although he claims to be an expert on humans, his knowledge of human anatomy and physiology is woefully inaccurate (at one point, he states that his doctorate is actually in art history). Zoidberg&#x27;s expertise seems to be with extra-terrestrial creatures. Homeless and penniless, he lives in the dumpster behind Planet Express. Although Zoidberg is depicted as being Professor Farnsworth&#x27;s long-time friend, he is held in contempt by everyone on the crew.
* Amy Wong (voiced by Lauren Tom) – Amy is an incredibly rich, blunt, ditzy, and accident-prone yet sweet-hearted long-term intern at Planet Express. She is an astrophysics student at Mars University and heiress to the western hemisphere of Mars. In the second episode of season one, the Professor states that he likes having Amy around because she has the same bloodtype as him. Born on Mars, she is ethnically Chinese and is prone to cursing in Cantonese and using 31st-century slang. Her parents are the wealthy ranchers Leo and Inez Wong. She is promiscuous in the beginning of the series, but eventually enters a monogamous relationship with Kif Kroker. In the show&#x27;s sixth season, she acquires her doctorate, and in the eighth season, she and Kif become parents.

===Setting===

&quot;Futurama&quot; is set in New New York at the turn of the 31st century, in a time filled with technological wonders. The city of New New York has been built over the ruins of present-day New York City, which has become a catacomb-like space that acts as New New York&#x27;s sewer, referred to as &quot;Old New York&quot;. Parts of the sewers are inhabited by mutants. Various devices and architecture are similar to the Populuxe style. Global warming, inflexible bureaucracy, and substance abuse are a few of the subjects given a 31st-century exaggeration in a world where the problems have become both more extreme and more common. Just as New York has become a more extreme version of itself in the future, other Earth locations are given the same treatment; Los Angeles, for example, is depicted as a smog-filled apocalyptic wasteland.

Numerous technological advances have been made between the present day and the 31st century. The Head Museum, which keeps a collection of heads alive in jars thanks to technology invented by Ron Popeil (who has a guest cameo in &quot;A Big Piece of Garbage&quot;), has resulted in many historical figures and current celebrities being present, including Groening himself; this became the writers&#x27; device to feature and poke fun at contemporary celebrities in the show. Several of the preserved heads shown are those of people who were already dead well before the advent of this technology; one of the most prominent examples of this anomaly is former U.S. president Richard Nixon, who died in 1994 and appears in numerous episodes. The Internet, while being fully immersive and encompassing all senses—even featuring its own digital world (similar to &quot;Tron&quot; or &quot;The Matrix&quot;)—is slow and largely consists of pornography, pop-up ads, and &quot;filthy&quot; (or Filthy Filthy) chat rooms. Some of it is edited to include educational material ostensibly for youth. Television is still a primary form of entertainment. Self-aware robots are a common sight, and are the main cause of global warming due to the exhaust from their alcohol-powered systems. The wheel is obsolete (no one but Fry even seems to recognize the design), having been forgotten and replaced by hover cars and a network of large, clear pneumatic transportation tubes.

Environmentally, common animals still remain, alongside mutated, cross-bred (sometimes with humans) and extraterrestrial animals. Ironically, spotted owls are often shown to have replaced rats as common household pests. Although rats still exist, sometimes rats act like pigeons, though pigeons still exist, as well. Anchovies have been extinct for 800 years because of the Decapodians. Earth still suffers the effects of greenhouse gases, although in one episode Leela states that its effects have been counteracted by nuclear winter. In another episode, the effects of global warming have been somewhat mitigated by the dropping of a giant ice cube into the ocean, and later by pushing Earth farther away from the sun, which also extended the year by one week.

Religion is a prominent part of society, although the dominant religions have evolved. A merging of the major religious groups of the 20th century has resulted in the First Amalgamated Church, while Voodoo is now mainstream. New religions include Oprahism, Robotology, and the banned religion of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom. Religious figures include Father Changstein-El-Gamal, the Robot Devil, Reverend Lionel Preacherbot, and passing references to the Space Pope, who appears to be a large crocodile-like creature. Several major holidays have robots associated with them, including the murderous Robot Santa and Kwanzaa-bot. While very few episodes focus exclusively on religion within the &quot;Futurama&quot; universe, they do cover a wide variety of subjects including predestination, prayer, the nature of salvation, and religious conversion.

&quot;Futurama&quot;″s setting is a backdrop, and the writers are not above committing continuity errors if they serve to further the gags. For example, while the pilot episode implies that the previous Planet Express crew was killed by a space wasp, the later episode &quot;The Sting&quot; is based on the crew having been killed by space bees instead. The &quot;world of tomorrow&quot; setting is used to highlight and lampoon issues of today and to parody the science-fiction genre.

==Episodes==

This list follows the season box sets, which feature the episodes in the original production season order, ignoring the order of broadcast. The Hulu revival has alternatively been titled the eighth and ninth seasons (production), and the eleventh and twelfth seasons (broadcast). The tenth and eleventh production seasons will also be considered as &quot;Futurama&quot; thirteenth and fourteenth broadcast seasons.
==Production==
===Development===

The television network Fox expressed a strong desire in the mid-1990s for Matt Groening to create a new series after the success of his previous series, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; Groening began conceiving &quot;Futurama&quot; during this period. In 1995, he enlisted David X. Cohen, then a writer and producer for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, to assist in developing the show. The two spent time researching science fiction books, television shows, and films. When they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and story lines; Groening claimed they had gone &quot;overboard&quot; in their discussions. Groening described trying to get the show on the air as &quot;by far the worst experience of my grown-up life&quot;.

Fox ordered thirteen episodes. Immediately after, however, Fox feared the themes of the show were not suitable for the network and Groening and Fox executives argued over whether the network would have any creative input into the show. With &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the network has no input. Fox was particularly disturbed by the concept of suicide booths, Doctor Zoidberg, and Bender&#x27;s anti-social behavior. Groening explains, &quot;When they tried to give me notes on &quot;Futurama&quot;, I just said: &#x27;No, we&#x27;re going to do this just the way we did &quot;Simpsons&quot;.&#x27; And they said, &#x27;Well, we don&#x27;t do business that way anymore.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Oh, well, that&#x27;s the only way I do business.&#x27;&quot; The episode &quot;I, Roommate&quot; was produced to address Fox&#x27;s concerns, with the script written to their specifications. Fox strongly disliked the episode, but after negotiations, Groening received the same independence with &quot;Futurama&quot;.

The name &quot;Futurama&quot; comes from a pavilion at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Designed by Norman Bel Geddes, the Futurama pavilion depicted how he imagined the world would look in 1959. Many other titles were considered for the series, including &quot;Aloha, Mars!&quot; and &quot;Doomsville&quot;, which Groening notes were &quot;resoundly rejected, by everyone concerned with it&quot;. It takes approximately six to nine months to produce an episode of &quot;Futurama&quot;. The long production time results in several episodes being worked on simultaneously.

===Writing===
The planning for each episode began with a table meeting of writers, who discussed the plot ideas as a group. The writers are given index cards with plot points that they are required to use as the center of activity in each episode. A single staff writer wrote an outline and then produced a script. Once the first draft of a script was finished, the writers and executive producers called in the actors for a table read. After this script reading, the writers collaborated to rewrite the script as a group before sending it to the animation team. At this point the voice recording was also started and the script was out of the writers&#x27; hands.

The writing staff held three Ph.D.s, seven master&#x27;s degrees, and cumulatively had more than 50 years at Harvard University. Series writer Patric M. Verrone stated, &quot;we were easily the most overeducated cartoon writers in history&quot;.

===Voice actors===

&quot;Futurama&quot; had eight main cast members. Billy West performed the voices of Philip J. Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Doctor Zoidberg, Zapp Brannigan, and many other incidental characters. West auditioned for &quot;just about every part&quot;, landing the roles of the Professor and Doctor Zoidberg. Although West read for Fry, his friend Charlie Schlatter was initially given the role. Due to a casting change, West was called back to audition again and was given the role. West claims that the voice of Fry is deliberately modeled on his own, so as to make it difficult for another person to replicate the voice. Doctor Zoidberg&#x27;s voice was based on Lou Jacobi and George Jessel. The character of Zapp Brannigan was originally created for and intended to be performed by Phil Hartman. Hartman insisted on auditioning for the role, and &quot;just nailed it&quot; according to Groening. Due to Hartman&#x27;s death, West was given the role. West states that his version of Zapp Brannigan was an imitation of Hartman and also &quot;modeled after a couple of big dumb announcers I knew&quot;.

Katey Sagal voiced Leela, and is the only member of the main cast to voice only one character. The role of Leela was originally assigned to Nicole Sullivan. In an interview in June 2010, Sagal remarked that she did not know that another person was to originally voice Leela until many years after the show first began.

John DiMaggio performed the voice of the robot Bender Bending Rodríguez and other, more minor, characters. Bender was the most difficult character to cast, as the show&#x27;s creators had not decided what a robot should sound like. DiMaggio originally auditioned for the role of Professor Farnsworth, using the voice he uses to perform Bender, and also auditioned for Bender using a different voice. DiMaggio described Bender&#x27;s voice as a combination of a sloppy drunk, Slim Pickens and a character his college friend created named &quot;Charlie the sausage-lover&quot;.

Phil LaMarr voices Hermes Conrad, his son Dwight, Ethan Bubblegum Tate, and Reverend Preacherbot. Lauren Tom voices Amy Wong, and Tress MacNeille voices Mom and various other characters. Maurice LaMarche voices Kif Kroker and several supporting characters. LaMarche won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 2011 for his performances as Lrrr and Orson Welles in the episode &quot;Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences&quot;. David Herman voiced Scruffy and various supporting characters. During seasons 1–4, LaMarche is billed as supporting cast and Tom, LaMarr and Herman billed as guest stars, despite appearing in most episodes. LaMarche was promoted to main cast and Tom, LaMarr and Herman to supporting cast in season 5, and promoted again to main cast in season 6.

In addition to the main cast, Frank Welker voiced Nibbler and Kath Soucie voiced Cubert and several supporting and minor characters. Like &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, many episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot; feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, entertainers, bands, musicians, and scientists. Many guest-stars voiced supporting characters, although many voiced themselves, usually as their own head preserved in a jar. Recurring guest stars included Tom Kenny, Dan Castellaneta (as the Robot Devil), Dawnn Lewis, Nicole St. John, Al Gore, Phil Hendrie, Coolio and George Takei, among others. Bumper Robinson used to be a cast member of the series (who played Hermes&#x27; son Dwight), but left the series after season 4 which caused Phil LaMarr to take over the role afterwards. John Goodman was meant to reprise the role of Robot Santa after &quot;Xmas Story&quot; in future episodes but was unable to reprise the role due to scheduling problems. As a result, John DiMaggio took over that role starting with &quot;A Tale of Two Santas&quot;. In that same episode, Dan Castellaneta was unable to reprise the Robot Devil due to his work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Maurice LaMarche took over that role for that episode only as Castellaneta did reprise the role in future episodes. Following Coolio&#x27;s death in 2022, David X. Cohen has revealed on TMZ that he recorded new dialogue for Kwanzaabot before his death in an upcoming episode, scheduled to be released in 2023.

===Animation===

&quot;Futurama&quot; is produced by The Curiosity Company and 20th Television Animation (which was previously credited as 30th Century Fox Television and is now credited as 30th Television Animation) with the animation being done by Rough Draft Studios. The studio would receive the completed script of an episode and create a storyboard consisting of more than 100 drawings. It would then produce a pencil-drawn animatic with 1,000 frames. Rough Draft&#x27;s sister studio in South Korea would render the 30,000-frame finished episode.

In addition to traditional cartoon drawing, Rough Draft Studios often used CGI for fast or complex shots, such as the movement of spaceships, explosions, nebulae, large crowds, and snow scenes. The opening sequence was entirely rendered in CGI. The CGI was rendered at 24 frames per second (as opposed to hand-drawn often done at 12 frames per second) and the lack of artifacts made the animation appear very smooth and fluid. CGI characters looked slightly different due to spatially &quot;cheating&quot; hand-drawn characters by drawing slightly out of proportion or off-perspective features to emphasize traits of the face or body, improving legibility of an expression. PowerAnimator and Maya were used to draw the comic-like CGI whilst Toonz was used for digital ink and paint and compositing.

The series began high-definition production in season 6, with &quot;&quot;. The opening sequence was re-rendered and scaled to adapt to the show&#x27;s transition to 16:9 widescreen format.

For the final episode of season 6, &quot;Futurama&quot; was completely reanimated in three different styles: the first segment of the episode features black-and-white Fleischer- and Walter Lantz-style animation, the second was drawn in the style of a low-resolution video game, and the final segment was in the style of Japanese anime.

==Hallmarks==
===Opening sequence===
Much like the opening sequence in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; with its chalkboard gags, Lisa’s sax solo, and couch gags, &quot;Futurama&quot; has a distinctive opening sequence featuring minor gags. As the show begins, blue lights fill the screen and the &quot;Planet Express Ship&quot; flies across the screen with the title of the show being spelled out in its wake. Underneath the title is a joke caption such as &quot;Painstakingly drawn before a live audience&quot; or &quot;When you see the robot: DRINK!&quot; After flying through downtown New New York and past various recurring characters, the Planet Express ship crashes through a large screen showing a short clip from a classic cartoon. These have included clips from &quot;Quasi at the Quackadero&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts, cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios, a short of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; from a &quot;Tracey Ullman&quot; episode, the show&#x27;s own opening sequence in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Hands Are Idle Playthings&quot; or a scene from the episode. Most episodes in Season 6 and Season 7 use an abridged opening sequence, omitting the brief clip of a classic cartoon. &quot;Rebirth&quot;, &quot;That Darn Katz!&quot;, &quot;Benderama&quot;, &quot;Yo Leela Leela&quot;, &quot;Decision 3012&quot;, &quot;Forty Percent Leadbelly&quot;, &quot;T.: The Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Leela and the Genestalk&quot;, and &quot;Stench and Stenchability&quot; have been the only episodes since &quot;Spanish Fry&quot; to feature a classic cartoon clip. Several episodes begin with a cold opening before the opening sequence, although these scenes do not always correspond with the episode&#x27;s plot. The opening sequence has been lampooned several times within the show, in episodes including &quot;That&#x27;s Lobstertainment!&quot;, &quot;The Problem with Popplers&quot;, as &quot;Future-roma&quot; in &quot;The Duh-Vinci Code&quot; and as &quot;Futurella&quot; in &quot;Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences&quot;. &quot;Decision 3012&quot; and &quot;The Problem with Popplers&quot; are the only episodes that directly tie into the opening, with Bender deliberately crashing the ship after seeing an advertisement for free beer in &quot;Decision 3012&quot;, while in &quot;The Problem with Popplers&quot;, Leela crashes through it during an ad for Popplers, with Fry saying &quot;That&#x27;s the second billboard you&#x27;ve crashed through this week!&quot;. &quot;Viva Mars Vegas&quot; features a unique handmade variant of the opening, using cardboard, plastic, and model ships guided by strings and rods.

Series director Scott Vanzo has remarked on the difficulty of animating the sequence. It took four to five weeks to fully animate the sequence, and it consists of over 80 levels of 3D animation composited together. It takes approximately one hour to render a single frame, and each second of the sequence consists of around 30 frames.

The &quot;Futurama&quot; theme was created by Christopher Tyng. The theme is played on the tubular bells but is occasionally remixed for use in specific episodes, including a version by the Beastie Boys used for the episode &quot;Hell Is Other Robots&quot;, in which they guest starred as their own heads for both a concert and as part of the Robot Devil&#x27;s song. The original version of the theme also samples a drum break originating from &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; by American soul group The Winstons. The theme has been noted for its similarities to Pierre Henry&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Psyché Rock&quot;.

It was originally intended for the &quot;Futurama&quot; theme to be remixed in every episode. This was first trialled in the opening sequence for &quot;Mars University&quot;, however it was realized upon broadcast that the sound did not transmit well through most television sets and the idea was subsequently abandoned. Despite this, beatbox renditions of the theme performed by Billy West and John DiMaggio are used for the episodes &quot;Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV&quot; and &quot;Spanish Fry&quot;.

As the series began high-definition production in 2007 with the four direct-to-DVD movies and season 6 on Comedy Central, the opening sequence was updated to match, and a slightly slower and revamped remix of the theme song, which replaced the Amen break with a higher-fidelity drum recording and was previously used in the &quot;Futurama&quot; video game, replaced the original theme. &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot; has an extended opening sequence, introducing each of the main characters. In &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; the ship passes through the screen&#x27;s glass and temporarily becomes part of the environment depicted therein—a pastiche of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; respectively—before crashing through the screen glass on the way out. In &quot;&quot;, a completely different opening sequence involves a trip through a futuristic version of Las Vegas located on Mars. The theme tune is sung by Seth MacFarlane and is different from the standard theme tune. The end of the film incorporates a unique variation of the opening sequence; as the &quot;Planet Express Ship&quot; enters a wormhole, it converts into a pattern of lights similar to the lights that appear in the opening sequence. All four movies&#x27; end credits utilized an edited version from the full-length remix of the theme instead of the original end credits theme, and an even shorter edit was introduced in season 6. Another update of the opening sequence in season 8 for Hulu added more visual gags, and the end credits theme was replaced again with an edit of the 2012 digital download release version, which added an extra layer of beats.

===Languages===

There are three alternative alphabets that appear often in the background of episodes, usually in the forms of graffiti, advertisements, or warning labels. Nearly all messages using alternative scripts transliterate directly into English. The first alphabet consists of abstract characters and is referred to as Alienese, a simple substitution cipher from the Latin alphabet. The second alphabet uses a more complex modular addition code, where the &quot;next letter is given by the summation of all previous letters plus the current letter&quot;. The codes often provide additional jokes for fans dedicated enough to decode the messages. The third language sometimes used is Hebrew. Aside from these alphabets, most of the displayed wording on the show uses the Latin alphabet.

The show predicts that several English expressions will have evolved by the year 3000. For example, in the show the word &quot;Christmas&quot; has been replaced with &quot;Xmas&quot; (pronounced &quot;&quot;ex&quot;-mas&quot;), and the word &quot;&quot; with &quot;aks&quot; (pronounced &quot;axe&quot;). According to David X. Cohen, it is a running joke that the French language is extinct in the &quot;Futurama&quot; universe (though the culture remains alive), much like Latin is in the present. In the French dubbing of the show, German is used as the extinct language instead.

===30th Century Fox===
A modified version of the 20th Century Fox Television logo is displayed at the end of each episode, reading &quot;30th Century Fox Television&quot; to fit the show&#x27;s setting in the 31st century. Syndicated episodes use a 30th Television closing logo instead of the 20th Television one, while episodes from Season 8 onward use a 30th Television Animation logo. Initially, Fox did not want this logo to be used on the show, but when creator Matt Groening purchased the rights to the logo, the network had a change of heart and allowed the altered version to be aired.

===Humor===
Although the series uses a wide range of styles of humor, including self-deprecation, black comedy, off-color humor, slapstick, and surreal humor, its primary source of comedy is its satirical depiction of everyday life in the future and its parodical comparisons to the present. Groening notes that, from the show&#x27;s conception, his goal was to make what was, on the surface, a goofy comedy that would have underlying &quot;legitimate literary science fiction concepts&quot;. The series contrasted &quot;low culture&quot; and &quot;high culture&quot; comedy; for example, Bender&#x27;s catchphrase is the insult &quot;Bite my shiny metal ass&quot; while his most terrifying nightmare is a vision of the number 2, a joke referring to the binary numeral system (Fry assures him, &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as two&quot;).

The series developed a cult following partially due to the large number of in-jokes it contains, most of which are aimed at &quot;nerds&quot;. In commentary on the DVD releases, David X. Cohen points out and sometimes explains his &quot;nerdiest joke[s]&quot;. These included mathematical jokes such as &quot;Loew&#x27;s formula_1-plex&quot; (aleph-null-plex) movie theater as well as various forms of science humor for example, Professor Farnsworth, at a racetrack, complains about the use of a quantum finish to decide the winner, exclaiming &quot;No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it&quot;, a reference to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. In the season six episode &quot;Law and Oracle&quot;, Fry and the robot peace officer URL track down a traffic violator who turns out to be Erwin Schrödinger, the 20th-century quantum physicist. On the front seat of the car is a box, and when questioned about the contents, Schrödinger replies &quot;A cat, some poison, and a cesium atom&quot;. Fry asks if the cat is alive or dead, and Schrödinger answers &quot;It&#x27;s a superposition of both states until you open the box and collapse the wave function.&quot; When Fry opens the box, the cat jumps out and attacks him. The run is a reference to the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat thought experiment of quantum mechanics. The series makes passing references to quantum chromodynamics (the appearance of Strong Force-brand glue), computer science (two separate books in a closet labeled &quot;P&quot; and &quot;NP&quot; respectively, referring to the possibility that P and NP-complete problem classes are distinct), electronics (an X-ray or more accurately, an &quot;F-ray&quot; of Bender&#x27;s head reveals a 6502 microprocessor), and genetics (a mention of Bender&#x27;s &quot;robo- or R-NA&quot;).

The show often features subtle references to classic science fiction. These are most often to &quot;Star Trek&quot; many soundbites are used in homage but also include the reference to the origin of the word &quot;robot&quot; made in the name of the robot-dominated planet Chapek 9, and the black rectangular monolith labeled &quot;Out of Order&quot; in orbit around Jupiter (a reference to Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; series). Bender and Fry sometimes watch a television show called &quot;The Scary Door&quot;, a humorous parody of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

Journalist/critic Frank Lovece in &quot;Newsday&quot; contrasted the humor tradition of Groening&#x27;s two series, finding that 

Animation maven Jerry Beck concurred: 

In an interview with Diego Molano, creator of &quot;Victor and Valentino&quot;, in April 2019, he said that he found &quot;Futurama&quot; &quot;incredibly influential&quot;, calling the humor smart but &quot;not alienating&quot;. He added that it makes him &quot;feel smart&quot; and adding that Groening&#x27;s &quot;sense of comedic timing is masterful&quot;.

==Cancellations, syndications and revivals==
===Fox cancellation===
Groening and Cohen wanted &quot;Futurama&quot; to be shown at 8:30 pm on Sunday, following &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The Fox network disagreed, opting instead to show two episodes in the Sunday night lineup before moving the show to a regular time slot on Tuesday. Beginning with its second broadcast season, &quot;Futurama&quot; was again placed in the 8:30 pm Sunday spot, but by mid-season the show was moved again, this time to 7:00 pm on Sunday, its third position in less than a year. Even by the fourth season, &quot;Futurama&quot; was being aired erratically. Because the show was regularly pre-empted by sporting events, it became difficult to predict when new episodes would air. The erratic schedule resulted in Fox not airing several episodes that had been produced for seasons three and four, instead holding them for a fifth broadcast season. According to Groening, Fox executives were not supporters of the show. Although &quot;Futurama&quot; was never officially cancelled, midway through the production of the fourth season, Fox decided to stop buying episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot;, letting it go out of production before the fall 2003 lineup.

===Adult Swim reruns===
In 2003, Cartoon Network acquired syndication rights to &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;, another animated show Fox had cancelled, for its Adult Swim block. Both shows proved to be successful immediately, leading to sister network TBS picking up the show later in 2003. The run on Adult Swim revived interest in both series, and when &quot;Family Guy&quot; found success in direct-to-DVD productions, &quot;Futurama&quot;″s producers decided to try the same. In 2005, Comedy Central entered negotiations to take over the syndication rights, during which they discussed the possibility of producing new episodes. In 2006, it was announced that four straight-to-DVD films would be produced, and later split into 16 episodes comprising a fifth season of the show. Since no new &quot;Futurama&quot; projects were in production at the time of release, the final movie release &quot;Into the Wild Green Yonder&quot; was designed to stand as the &quot;Futurama&quot; series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the franchise in some form, including a theatrical film. In an interview with CNN, Groening said that &quot;we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don&#x27;t know... We&#x27;re having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s just me.&quot; &quot;Futurama&quot; left Adult Swim&#x27;s lineup on December 31, 2007, following a week-long marathon of the entire series. Comedy Central began airing the show the next day, with season 5 making its broadcast debut on March 23, 2008.

===Comedy Central revival===
In June 2009, 20th Century Fox Television announced that Comedy Central had picked up the show for 26 new half-hour episodes that began airing on June 24, 2010. The returning writing crew was smaller than the original crew. It was originally announced that main voice actors West, DiMaggio, and Sagal would return as well, but on July 17, 2009, it was announced that a casting notice was posted to replace the entire cast when 20th Century Fox Television would not meet their salary demands. The situation was later resolved, and the entire original voice-cast returned for the new episodes.

Near the end of a message from Maurice LaMarche sent to members of the &quot;Save the Voices of Futurama&quot; group on Facebook, LaMarche announced that the original cast would be returning for the new episodes. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; confirmed, announcing on their website that the original cast of &quot;Futurama&quot; signed contracts with Fox to return for 26 more episodes. Similarly, an email sent to fans from Cohen and Groening reported that West, Sagal, DiMaggio, LaMarche, MacNeille, Tom, LaMarr, and Herman would all be returning for the revival.

Cohen told &quot;Newsday&quot; in August 2009 that the reported 26-episode order means &quot;[i]t will be up to 26. I can&#x27;t guarantee it will be 26. But I think there&#x27;s a pretty good chance it&#x27;ll be exactly 26. Fox has been a little bit cagey about it, even internally. But nobody&#x27;s too concerned. We&#x27;re plunging ahead&quot;. Two episodes were in the process of being voice-recorded at that time, with an additional &quot;six scripts ... in the works, ranging in scale from &#x27;it&#x27;s a crazy idea that someone&#x27;s grandmother thought of&#x27; to &#x27;it&#x27;s all on paper&#x27;.

When &quot;Futurama&quot; aired June 24, 2010, on Comedy Central, it helped the network to its highest-rated night in 2010 and its highest-rated Thursday primetime in the network&#x27;s history. In March 2011, it was announced that &quot;Futurama&quot; had been renewed for a seventh season, consisting of at least 26 episodes, scheduled to air in 2012 and 2013. The first episode of season 7 premiered June 20, 2012, on Comedy Central.

In July 2011, it was reported that the show had been picked up for syndication by both local affiliates and WGN America. Broadcast of old episodes began in September 2011. On September 19, 2011, WGN America began re-running &quot;Futurama&quot;, carrying it until 2014. &quot;Futurama&quot; doubled its viewership in syndication in 2012.

Due to the uncertain future of the series, there have been four designated series finales. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Hands Are Idle Playthings&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Overclockwise&quot;, and &quot;Meanwhile&quot; have all been written to serve as a final episode for the show.

===Comedy Central cancellation===
Comedy Central announced in April 2013 that they would be airing the final episode &quot;Meanwhile&quot; on September 4, 2013. The producers said that they are exploring options for the future of the series as &quot;[they] have many more stories to tell&quot;, but would gauge fan reaction to the news. Groening and Cohen had previously expressed a desire to produce a theatrical film or another direct-to-video film upon conclusion of the series.

In an August 2013 interview with &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot;, Katey Sagal said regarding the series finale, &quot;So I don&#x27;t believe it... I just hold out hope for it because it has such a huge fan base, it&#x27;s such a smart show, and why wouldn&#x27;t somebody want to keep making that show; so that&#x27;s my thought, I&#x27;m just in denial that it&#x27;s over&quot;. Sagal also mentioned during the same interview that Groening told her at Comic-Con that &quot;we&#x27;ll find a place&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not going to end&quot;.

===&quot;Simpsorama&quot;===
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Simpsorama&quot; is an official crossover with &quot;Futurama&quot;. It originally aired during the twenty-sixth season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on Fox on November 9, 2014, over a year after the &quot;Futurama&quot; series finale aired on Comedy Central.

=== Further syndication ===
In October 2017, Syfy announced that they had acquired syndication rights to all 140 episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot;, adding it to its lineup on November 11, 2017, with a weekend long marathon. &quot;Futurama&quot; was Syfy&#x27;s first ever American animated series (the network had an anime programming block in the past), and eventually became paired with Syfy&#x27;s TZGZ block of animated original series on Saturday nights. Comedy Central continued to air the series concurrently with Syfy, usually in the mornings and early afternoon. Syfy aired episodes from the first four seasons cropped to 16:9 instead of airing them in their original 4:3 aspect ratio; Comedy Central (since 2017) and FXX would do the same.

In September 2021, FXX, which already carries &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and other 20th Television animated programming, announced that it would begin airing &quot;Futurama&quot; that November. Syfy stopped airing the show on November 10, 2021, and FXX began airing the show on November 15, 2021. Adult Swim then picked the show back up on December 27, 2021. Unlike FXX, Adult Swim airs the first four seasons in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, pillarboxed. However, seasons 5 through 7, which were produced in 16:9, are cropped to 4:3. As of 2024, Comedy Central still holds rights to the series, usually airing it in the early morning.

===Hulu revival===
In February 2022, Hulu revived the series with a 20-episode order to premiere in 2023. At the time of the announcement, the majority of the main voice cast was set to return, while John DiMaggio was still in negotiations. The next day, Disney+ (Hulu&#x27;s sister streaming service) announced in a press release that the new season would stream internationally as a Star Original. DiMaggio stated that he had not accepted the role in mid-February 2022 because he believed the entire cast of &quot;Futurama&quot; should be paid more. He stated, &quot;Bender is part of my soul and nothing about this is meant to be disrespectful to the fans or my &quot;Futurama&quot; family. It&#x27;s about self-respect. And honestly, [it&#x27;s about] being tired of an industry that&#x27;s become far too corporate and takes advantage of artists&#x27; time and talent... I wish I could give you every detail so you would understand, but it&#x27;s not my place.&quot;

In March, DiMaggio officially rejoined the series after working out a new deal, calling the prior events &quot;Bendergate&quot;. He later revealed that he did not get a raise, &quot;but what I did get was a lot of respect&quot;. Had he not returned, Bender would have been voiced by a different guest star in each episode. In August 2022, the titles of the first ten episodes were announced by Hulu, and by November 2022, the production team was aiming to complete the episodes by the end of the year. In February 2023, a new release date was set sometime around the 2023 summer season. On May 18, 2023, a teaser trailer was released, announcing the premiere date as July 24, 2023. This second revival has alternatively been titled the eighth and ninth seasons (production) and the eleventh and twelfth seasons (broadcast). With the revival on Hulu, the season carries a new version of the opening title sequence, containing a briefly altered name &quot;Hulurama&quot; before reverting to &quot;Futurama&quot;.

On November 2, 2023, Hulu renewed the series for tenth and eleventh production seasons; a total of 20 episodes were ordered for the new seasons, which will air from 2025 to 2026.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The show received critical acclaim. The first season holds an 82% approval rating at review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews, an average rating of 8.75/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;Good news, everyone! &quot;Futurama&quot; is an inventive, funny, and sometimes affecting look at the world of tomorrow.&quot; Season 5 holds a rating of 100%, based on seven reviews, and an average score of 8.67/10. Season 6 has an approval rating of 100%, based on 16 reviews, and the average rating is 8.31/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Good news everyone! &quot;Futurama&quot; is as funny and endearing as ever in its sixth season.&quot; The next season received a rating of 92%, and an 8.24/10 average score based on 12 reviews. The critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Futurama&quot; makes the most of its second life with biting social satire, kooky sci-fi scenarios, and a stirringly sweet series finale.&quot; For the eighth season, 86% of 29 reviews are positive, while the consensus states, &quot;Shut up and take our money!&quot;.

===Ratings===
&quot;Futurama&quot;″s 7:00 p.m. Sunday time slot caused the show to often be pre-empted by sports and usually have a later-than-average season premiere. It also allowed the writers and animators to get ahead of the broadcast schedule so that episodes intended for one season were not aired until the following season. By the beginning of the fourth broadcast season, all the episodes to be aired that season had already been completed and writers were working at least a year in advance.

When &quot;Futurama&quot; debuted in the Fox Sunday night lineup at 8:30 p.m. between &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot; on March 28, 1999, it managed 19 million viewers, tying for 11th overall in that week&#x27;s Nielsen ratings. The following week, airing at the same time, &quot;Futurama&quot; drew 14.2 million viewers. The third episode, the first airing on Tuesday, drew 8.85 million viewers. Though its ratings were well below &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the first season of &quot;Futurama&quot; rated higher than competing animated series: &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Dilbert&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, and &quot;The PJs&quot;.

When &quot;Futurama&quot; was effectively canceled in 2003, it had averaged 6.4 million viewers for the first half of its fourth broadcast season.

In late 2002, Cartoon Network acquired exclusive cable syndication rights to &quot;Futurama&quot; for a reported $10 million (equivalent to $ million in ). In January 2003, the network began airing &quot;Futurama&quot; episodes as the centerpiece to the expansion of their Adult Swim cartoon block. In October 2005, Comedy Central picked up the cable syndication rights to air &quot;Futurama&quot;″s 72-episode run at the start of 2008, following the expiration of Cartoon Network&#x27;s contract. A Comedy Central teaser trailer announced the return of &quot;Futurama&quot; March 23, 2008, which was &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot; divided into four episodes followed by the other three movies.

On June 24, 2010, the season 6 premiere, &quot;Rebirth&quot;, drew 2.92 million viewers in the 10:00 p.m. time slot on Comedy Central. The second episode of the sixth season, &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela&quot;, aired at 10:30 p.m., immediately following the season premiere. &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela&quot; drew 2.78 million viewers. This was the series&#x27; premiere on the network, with original episodes—the fifth season had previously aired on the network, but it had originally been released in the form of the four direct-to-video films.

===Accolades===

===Other honors===
*In January 2009, IGN named &quot;Futurama&quot; as the eighth best in the &quot;Top 100 Animated TV Series&quot;.
*At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, Guinness World Records presented &quot;Futurama&quot; with the record for &quot;Current Most Critically Acclaimed Animated Series&quot;.
*In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it as the thirty-ninth best science fiction television show ever.

==Other media==
===Comic books===
First started in November 2000, &quot;Futurama Comics&quot; is a comic book series published by Bongo Comics based in the &quot;Futurama&quot; universe. While originally published only in the US, a UK, German and Australian version of the series is also available. In addition, three issues were published in Norway. Other than a different running order and presentation, the stories are the same in all versions. While the comics focus on the same characters in the &quot;Futurama&quot; fictional universe, the comics may not be canonical as the events portrayed within them do not necessarily have any effect upon the continuity of the show.

Like the TV series, each comic (except US comic #20) has a caption at the top of the cover. For example: &quot;Made In The USA! (Printed in Canada)&quot;. Some of the UK and Australian comics have different captions on the top of their comics (for example, the Australian version of #20 says &quot;A 21st Century Comic Book&quot; across the cover, while the US version does not have a caption on that issue). All series contain a letters page, artwork from readers, and previews of other upcoming Bongo comics.

===Films===

When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air &quot;Futurama&quot; reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. Negotiations were already underway with the possibility of creating two or three straight-to-DVD films. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four films would be produced. On April 26, 2006, Groening noted in an interview that co-creator David X. Cohen and numerous writers from the original series would be returning to work on the movies. All the original voice actors participated. In February 2007, Groening explained the format of the new stories: &quot;[The crew is] writing them as movies and then we&#x27;re going to chop them up, reconfigure them, write new material and try to make them work as separate episodes.&quot;

The first film, &quot;&quot;, was written by Ken Keeler and Cohen, and includes return appearances by the Nibblonians, Seymour, Barbados Slim, Robot Santa, the &quot;God&quot; space entity, Al Gore, and Zapp Brannigan. It was animated in widescreen and was released on standard DVD on November 27, 2007, with a possible Blu-ray Disc release to follow. A release on HD DVD was rumored but later officially denied. &quot;Futurama: Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot; was the first DVD release for which 20th Century Fox implemented measures intended to reduce the total carbon footprint of the production, manufacturing, and distribution processes. Where it was not possible to completely eliminate carbon, output carbon offsets were used, thus making the complete process carbon neutral.

The second movie, &quot;&quot;, was released on June 24, 2008. The third movie, &quot;&quot;, was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on November 3, 2008, in the UK, November 4, 2008, in the US, and December 10, 2008, in Australia. The fourth movie, &quot;&quot;, was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on February 24, 2009.

Following the series&#x27; revival, the show&#x27;s executive producer Claudia Katz had announced more upcoming movies for Hulu while also hinting a theatrical release.

===Video games===

On September 15, 2000, Unique Development Studios acquired the license to develop a &quot;Futurama&quot; video game for consoles and handheld systems. Fox Interactive signed on to publish the game. Sierra Entertainment later became the game&#x27;s publisher, and it was released on August 14, 2003. Versions are available for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, both of which use cel-shading technology. However, the game was subsequently canceled on the GameCube and Game Boy Advance in North America and Europe.

In 2012, an app inspired by the head in a jar gag was launched by Matt Groening.

In September 2016, &quot;Futurama&quot; characters and content would be playable in a crossover free-to-play digital collectable card video game &quot;Animation Throwdown: The Quest for Cards&quot;, which also contained characters and content from other 20th Television Animation properties; particularly &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, and (as of 2023) &quot;Archer&quot;. The game was released on September 27, 2016 and is available for Android, iOS, Steam, Kartridge and on the web via the game&#x27;s developer Kongregate.

Licensing for mobile games were done in 2016 with &quot;Futurama: Game of Drones&quot; and in 2017 with &quot;&quot;, which was released for Android and iOS in 2017.

On July 25, 2023, &quot;Fortnite&quot; released an update that included theme content centered on the show &quot;Futurama&quot;, including purchasable outfits. These outfits include Bender Bending Rodríguez, Philip J. Fry, and Turanga Leela, as well as other themed accessories. The weapon &quot;Bender&#x27;s Shiny Metal Raygun&quot; has also been included in the game.

<text>Apogee Entertainment, formerly Apogee Software, LLC, is an American video game publisher based in Rowlett, Texas. The company was founded by Terry Nagy in 2008 after he licensed the rights to the name and logo from Scott Miller and his company, 3D Realms, which had used both previously. After reorganizing as Apogee Entertainment in 2021, it hired Miller for its publishing operations.

== History ==
The original Apogee Software was founded by Scott Miller in 1987 and utilized the Apogee name and logo until 1996, when the company adopted the trade name &quot;3D Realms&quot;. In 2008, Terry Nagy, a college friend of Miller, licensed the rights to the &quot;Apogee Software&quot; name and logo, as well as the rights to several games developed under that name, and established a company to publish further titles using the moniker. The publisher&#x27;s opening was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on July 14, 2008.

The company immediately announced the &quot;Duke Nukem Trilogy&quot;, three new games in the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; series—&quot;Critical Mass&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, and &quot;Proving Grounds&quot;—to be released on Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. A co-publishing deal was reached with Deep Silver to ensure wide distribution of the titles. &quot;Critical Mass&quot; was released for Nintendo DS in May 2011, however, its PlayStation Portable version, as well as &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; and &quot;Proving Grounds&quot;, ultimately stayed unreleased. Apogee Software, LLC released Interceptor Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; and the &quot;Apogee Throwback Pack&quot; in July 2013, as well as &quot;Radical Heroes: Crimson City Crisis&quot; from Mad Unicorn Games in 2016.

During 3D Realms&#x27; &quot;Realms Deep 2020&quot; event in September 2020, Apogee Software, LLC announced remastered editions of the original &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; (co-published by 3D Realms) and &quot;Crystal Caves&quot;.

The company announced it was rebranding itself to Apogee Entertainment in April 2021 and focusing solely on indie game publishing. Alongside this announcement, the company announced that they brought on Miller to assist in publishing efforts.

<text>Orthorexia nervosa (; ON; also known as orthorexia) is a proposed eating disorder characterized by an excessive preoccupation with eating healthy food. The term was introduced in 1997 by American physician Steven Bratman, who suggested that some people&#x27;s dietary restrictions intended to promote health may paradoxically lead to unhealthy consequences, such as social isolation, anxiety, loss of ability to eat in a natural, intuitive manner, reduced interest in the full range of other healthy human activities, and, in rare cases, severe malnutrition or even death.

In 2009, Ursula Philpot, chair of the British Dietetic Association and senior lecturer at Leeds Metropolitan University, described people with orthorexia nervosa as being &quot;solely concerned with the quality of the food they put in their bodies, refining and restricting their diets according to their personal understanding of which foods are truly &#x27;pure&#x27;.&quot; This differs from other eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, where those affected focus on the quantity of food eaten.

Orthorexia nervosa also differs from anorexia nervosa in that it does not disproportionally affect one gender. Studies have found that orthorexia nervosa is equally found in both men and women with no significant gender differences at all. Furthermore, research has found significant positive correlations between orthorexia nervosa and both narcissism and perfectionism, but no significant correlation between orthorexia nervosa and self esteem. This suggests that intense orthorexia nervosa individuals likely take pride over their healthy eating habits over others and that is the driving force behind their orthorexia as opposed to body image like anorexia. 

Orthorexia nervosa is not recognized as an eating disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, and so is not mentioned as an official diagnosis in the widely used &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM).

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of orthorexia nervosa include &quot;obsessive focus on food choice, planning, purchase, preparation, and consumption; food regarded primarily as source of health rather than pleasure; distress or disgust when in proximity to prohibited foods; exaggerated faith that inclusion or elimination of particular kinds of food can prevent or cure disease or affect daily well-being; periodic shifts in dietary beliefs while other processes persist unchanged; moral judgment of others based on dietary choices; body image distortion around sense of physical &quot;impurity&quot; rather than weight; persistent belief that dietary practices are health-promoting despite evidence of malnutrition.&quot;

==Cause==
While the current research on the causes of orthorexia nervosa is limited, significant evidence supports the idea of associated risk factors. Generally, eating disorders are influenced by a variety of factors including: biological, psychological, and sociocultural influences.

; Biological Influences

The biological components relating to orthorexia nervosa specifically have not been directly identified. However, studies of other eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder have noticed several biological influences. These factors include hormone levels, neurotransmitters, and even genetic components. Additionally, researchers have found strong correlations between orthorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

; Psychological Influences

Orthorexic tendencies typically occur in individuals with lower self-esteem, stemming from social comparison. Excessive dieting may also reflect patterns of perfectionism and the need for control. These same tendencies also act as ways to cope with difficult emotions or traumatic experiences. Some have even noticed associations between orthorexia nervosa and substance abuse.

; Sociocultural Influences

Similar to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, orthorexia nervosa typically also stems from social pressures, distorted body image, and desires to be thin. The Tripartite Influence Model identifies parents, peers, and media as key influences on body image and disordered eating.

==Diagnosis==
In 2016, formal criteria for orthorexia were proposed in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Eating Behaviors&quot; by Thom Dunn and Steven Bratman. These criteria are as follows:

Criterion A. Obsessive focus on &quot;healthy&quot; eating, as defined by a dietary theory or set of beliefs whose specific details may vary; marked by exaggerated emotional distress in relationship to food choices perceived as unhealthy; weight loss may ensue, but this is conceptualized as an aspect of ideal health rather than as the primary goal. As evidenced by the following:

#Compulsive behavior and/or mental preoccupation regarding affirmative and restrictive dietary practices believed by the individual to promote optimum health. (Footnotes to this criterion add: Dietary practices may include use of concentrated &quot;food supplements&quot;. Exercise performance and/or fit body image may be regarded as an aspect or indicator of health.) 
#Violation of self-imposed dietary rules causes exaggerated fear of disease, sense of personal impurity and/or negative physical sensations, accompanied by anxiety and shame.
#Dietary restrictions escalate over time, and may come to include elimination of entire food groups and involve progressively more frequent and/or severe &quot;cleanses&quot; (partial fasts) regarded as purifying or detoxifying. This escalation commonly leads to weight loss, but the desire to lose weight is absent, hidden or subordinated to ideation about healthy food.

Criterion B. The compulsive behavior and mental preoccupation becomes clinically impairing by any of the following:

# Malnutrition, severe weight loss or other medical complications from restricted diet
# Intrapersonal distress or impairment of social, academic or vocational functioning secondary to beliefs or behaviors about healthy diet
# Positive body image, self-worth, identity and/or satisfaction excessively dependent on compliance with self-defined &quot;healthy&quot; eating behavior.

A diagnostic questionnaire has been developed for orthorexia sufferers, similar to questionnaires for other eating disorders, named the ORTO-15. However, Dunn and Bratman critique this survey tool as lacking appropriate internal and external validation.

== Epidemiology ==
Results across scientific findings have yet to find a definitive conclusion to support whether nutrition students and professionals are at higher risk than other population subgroups, due to differing results in the research literature. There are only a few notable scientific works that, in an attempt to explore the breadth and depth of the still vaguely-understood illness, have tried to identify which groups in society are most vulnerable to its onset. This includes a 2008 German study, which based its research on the widespread suspicion that the most nutritionally-informed, such as university nutrition students, are a potential high-risk group for eating disorders, due to a substantial accumulation of knowledge on food and its relationship to health; the idea being that the more one knows about health, the more likely an unhealthy fixation about being healthy can develop. This study also inferred that orthorexic tendencies may even fuel a desire to study the science, indicating that many within this field might suffer from the disorder before commencing the course. However the results found that the students in the study, upon initial embarkation of their degree, did not have higher orthorexic values than other non-nutrition university students, and thus the report concluded that further research is needed to clarify the relationship between food-education and the onset of ON.

Similarly, in a Portuguese study on nutrition tertiary students, the participants&#x27; orthorexic scores (according to the ORTO-15 diagnostic questionnaire) actually decreased as they progressed through their course, as well as the overall risk of developing an eating disorder being an insignificant 4.2 percent. The participants also answered questionnaires to provide insight into their eating behaviours and attitudes, and despite this study finding that nutrition and health-science students tend to have more restrictive eating behaviours, these studies however found no evidence to support that these students have &quot;more disturbed or disordered eating patterns than other students&quot;. These two aforementioned studies conclude that the more understanding of food one has is not necessarily a risk factor for ON, explaining that the data gathered suggests dietetics professionals are not at significant risk of it.

However, these epidemiologic studies have been critiqued as using a fundamentally flawed survey tool that inflates prevalence rates. Scholars have questioned both the reliability and validity of the ORTO-15.

Most scientific findings tend to agree, however, young adults and adolescents are extremely susceptible to developing eating disorders. One study found that there was no relationship between BOT score and college major, which may indicate the prevalence of mental health issues and eating disorders on college campuses and that health and science majors are no longer the only ones affected. More studies have also been conducted on the link between increased Instagram use and Orthorexia nervosa. The social media based healthy community has recently grown in popularity especially on platforms such as Instagram. The hashtag #food is one of the top 25 most popular hashtags on Instagram. A study that investigated this relationship found that increased use of Instagram correlated between symptoms of ON with no other social media platform having the same effect. With young adults and adolescents making up the majority of social media users, exposure to this type of content can lead to developing unhealthy behavior.

== History ==
In a 1997 article in the magazine &quot;Yoga Journal&quot;, the American physician Steven Bratman coined the term &quot;orthorexia nervosa&quot; from the Greek ὀρθο- (&quot;ortho&quot;, &quot;right&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;), and ὄρεξις (&quot;orexis&quot;, &quot;appetite&quot;), literally meaning &#x27;correct appetite&#x27;, but in practice meaning &#x27;correct diet&#x27;. The term is modeled on &quot;anorexia&quot;, literally meaning &quot;without appetite&quot;, as used in the definition of the condition anorexia nervosa. (In both terms, &quot;nervosa&quot; indicates an unhealthy psychological state.) Bratman described orthorexia as an unhealthy fixation with what the individual considers to be healthy eating. Beliefs about what constitutes healthy eating commonly originate in one or another dietary theory such as raw foodism or macrobiotics, but are then taken to extremes, leading to disordered eating patterns and psychological and/or physical impairment. Bratman based this proposed condition on his personal experiences in the 1970s, as well as behaviors he observed among his patients in the 1990s. 

Following the publication of the book, in 2004 a team of Italian researchers from La Sapienza University of Rome, published the first empirical study attempting to develop a tool to measure the prevalence of orthorexia, known as the ORTO-15.

In 2015, responding to news articles in which the term orthorexia is applied to people who merely follow a non-mainstream theory of healthy eating, Bratman specified the following: &quot;A theory may be conventional or unconventional, extreme or lax, sensible or totally wacky, but, regardless of the details, followers of the theory do not necessarily have orthorexia. They are simply adherents of a dietary theory. The term &#x27;orthorexia&#x27; only applies when an eating disorder develops around that theory.&quot; Bratman elsewhere clarifies that with a few exceptions, most common theories of healthy eating are followed safely by the majority of their adherents; however, &quot;for some people, going down the path of a restrictive diet in search of health may escalate into dietary perfectionism.&quot; Karin Kratina, PhD, writing for the National Eating Disorders Association, summarizes this process as follows: &quot;Eventually food choices become so restrictive, in both variety and calories, that health suffers – an ironic twist for a person so completely dedicated to healthy eating.&quot;

Although orthorexia is not recognized as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, and it is not listed in the DSM-5, as of January 2016, four case reports and more than 40 other articles on the subject have been published in a variety of peer-reviewed journals internationally. According to a study published in 2011, two-thirds of a sample of 111 Dutch-speaking eating disorder specialists felt they had observed the syndrome in their clinical practice.

According to the &quot;Macmillan English Dictionary,&quot; the word is entering the English lexicon. The concept of orthorexia as a newly developing eating disorder has attracted significant media attention in the 21st century.

== Orthorexia and other disorders ==
Orthorexia differs from anorexia and bulimia in its relationship to food. Instead of focusing on food intake in an attempt to lose weight and eat less, orthorexia is an &quot;obsession about the quality of food intake&quot; and is fueled by a feeling of achieving perfection and purity by only consuming &quot;healthy&quot; foods.

Orthorexic behaviors can often lead to malnutrition and weight loss, and it is often associated with anorexia nervosa. Studies have also shown that obsessive-compulsive tendencies are linked to the development of orthorexia, and some researchers suggest that orthorexia should be diagnosed as OCD because it is driven by an obsession for attaining a perfect diet.
