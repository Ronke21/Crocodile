<text>The just price is a theory of ethics in economics that attempts to set standards of fairness in transactions. With intellectual roots in ancient Greek philosophy, it was advanced by Thomas Aquinas based on an argument against usury, which in his time referred to the making of any rate of interest on loans. It gave rise to the contractual principle of &quot;laesio enormis&quot;.

==Unjust price: a kind of fraud==
The argument against usury was that the lender was receiving income for nothing, since nothing was actually lent, rather the money was exchanged. Furthermore, a dollar can only be fairly exchanged for a dollar, so asking for more is unfair. Aquinas later expanded his argument to oppose any unfair earnings made in trade, basing the argument on the Golden Rule. The Christian should &quot;do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot;, meaning he should trade value for value. Aquinas believed that it was specifically immoral to raise prices because a particular buyer had an urgent need for what was being sold and could be persuaded to pay a higher price because of local conditions:

:If someone would be greatly helped by something belonging to someone else, and the seller not similarly harmed by losing it, the seller must not sell for a higher price: because the usefulness that goes to the buyer comes not from the seller, but from the buyer&#x27;s needy condition: no one ought to sell something that doesn&#x27;t belong to him.
::— &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot;, 2-2, q. 77, art. 1

Aquinas would therefore condemn practices such as raising the price of building supplies in the wake of a natural disaster. Increased demand caused by the destruction of existing buildings does not add to a seller&#x27;s costs, so to take advantage of buyers&#x27; increased willingness to pay constituted a species of fraud in Aquinas&#x27;s view.

Aquinas believed all gains made in trade must relate to the labour exerted by the merchant, not to the need of the buyer. Hence, he condoned moderate gain as payment even for unnecessary trade, provided the price were regulated and kept within certain bounds:

:...there is no reason why gain [from trading] may not be directed to some necessary or even honourable end; and so trading will be rendered lawful; as when a man uses moderate gains acquired in trade for the support of his household, or even to help the needy...

==Later reinterpretations of the doctrine==
=== School of Salamanca ===
With their reflexions on Contract law and fairness in exchange, the members of the School of Salamanca were often confronted with the notion of just price.

The just price of something, which respects the principle of commutative justice, depend on many factors. It have a certain latitude because it&#x27;s not the result of God&#x27;s will or of labor but of the common estimation of the people (communis aestimatio hominum). On this Luis Saravia de la Calle wrote in 1544:
Those who measure the just price by the labour, costs, and risk incurred by the person who deals in the merchandise or produces it, or by the cost of transport or the expense of traveling...or by what he has to pay the factors for their industry, risk, and labour, are greatly in error... For the just price arises from the abundance or scarcity of goods, merchants, and money...and not from costs, labour, and risk... Why should a bale of linen brought overland from Brittany at great expense be worth more than one which is transported cheaply by sea?... Why should a book written out by hand be worth more than one which is printed, when the latter is better though it costs less to produce?... The just price is found not by counting the cost but by the common estimation.

However, as this quote might suggest, the just price isn&#x27;t always the market price. the members of the School of Salamanca thought that authories were sometimes required to intervene and to control prices, especially in monopoly cases or for staples.

Every violation of the just price constitutes a &quot;laesio&quot; for one, and an unjust enrichment, an infraction to the seventh Commandments and a sin for the other. Only a restitution of the undue prince enables the absolution and bring back the contractual equilibrium.

=== Capitalism ===
With the rise of Capitalism, the use of just price theory faded, largely replaced by the microeconomic concept of supply and demand from Locke, Steuart, Ricardo, Ibn Taymiyyah, and especially Adam Smith. In modern economics regarding returns to the means of production, interest is seen as payment for a valuable service, which is the use of the money, though most banking systems still forbid excessive interest rates.

Likewise, during the rapid expansion of capitalism over the past several centuries the theory of the just price was used to justify popular action against merchants who raised their prices in years of dearth. The Marxist historian E. P. Thompson emphasized the continuing force of this tradition in his article on the &quot;Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century.&quot; Other historians and sociologists have uncovered the same phenomenon in variety of other situations including peasants riots in continental Europe during the nineteenth century and in many developing countries in the twentieth. The political scientist James C. Scott, for example, showed how this ideology could be used as a method of resisting authority in &quot;The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Subsistence and Rebellion in Southeast Asia&quot;.

==&quot;Laesio enormis&quot;==

Although the Imperial Roman Code, the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; had stated that the parties to an exchange were entitled to try to outwit one another, the view developed that a contract could be unwound if it was significantly detrimental to one party: if there were abnormal harm (&quot;laesio enormis&quot;). This meant that if an agreement was significantly imbalanced to the detriment of one party, the courts would decline to enforce it, and have jurisdiction to reverse unjust enrichment. Through the 19th century, the codifications in France and Germany declined to adopt the principle while common law jurisdictions attempted to generalise the doctrine of freedom of contract. However, in practice, and increasingly over the 20th century and early 21st century, the law of consumer protection, tenancy contracts, and labour law was regulated by statute to require fairness in exchange. Certain terms would be compulsory, others would be regarded as unfair, and courts could substitute their judgment for what would be just in all the circumstances.

<text>Tokaji ( ) or Tokay is the name of the wines from the Tokaj wine region (also &quot;Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region&quot; or &quot;Tokaj-Hegyalja&quot;) in Hungary or the adjoining Tokaj wine region in Slovakia. This region is noted for its sweet wines made from grapes affected by noble rot, a style of wine which has a long history in this region. The &quot;nectar&quot; coming from the grapes of Tokaj is also mentioned in the national anthem of Hungary.

The Slovak wine region of Tokaj may use the &quot;Tokajský/-á/-é&quot; label (&quot;of Tokaj&quot; in Slovak) if they apply the Hungarian quality control regulation. This area used to be part of the greater Tokaj-Hegyalja region within the Kingdom of Hungary, but was divided between Hungary and Czechoslovakia after the Treaty of Trianon.

==Cultivation==

Six grape varieties are officially approved for Tokaji wine production:

* Furmint
* Hárslevelű
* Yellow Muscat (Hungarian: &quot;Sárgamuskotály&quot;)
* Zéta (previously called Oremus – a cross of Furmint and Bouvier grapes)
* Kövérszőlő
* Kabar (a cross of Hárslevelű and Bouvier grapes)

Furmint accounts for 60% of the area and is by far the most important grape in the production of Aszú wines. Hárslevelű stands for further 30%. Nevertheless, an impressive range of different types and styles of wines are produced in the region, ranging from dry whites to the Eszencia, the world&#x27;s sweetest wine.

The area where Tokaji wine is traditionally grown is a small plateau, above sea level, near the Carpathian Mountains. The soil is of volcanic origin, with high concentrations of iron and lime. The location of the region has a unique climate, beneficial to this particular viniculture, due to the protection of the nearby mountains. Winters are bitterly cold and windy; spring tends to be cool and dry, and summers are noticeably hot. Usually, autumn brings rain early on, followed by an extended Indian summer, allowing a very long ripening period.

The Furmint grapes begin maturation with thick skins, but as they ripen the skins become thinner, and transparent. This allows the sun to penetrate the grape and evaporate much of the liquid inside, producing a higher concentration of sugar. Other types of grapes mature to the point of bursting, however, unlike most other grapes, Furmint will grow a second skin which seals it from rot. This also has the effect of concentrating the grape&#x27;s natural sugars. The grapes are left on the vine long enough to develop the &quot;noble rot&quot; (Botrytis cinerea) mold. Grapes then are harvested, sometimes as late as December (and in the case of true Eszencia, occasionally into January).

Typical yearly production in the region runs to a relatively small .

==Types of Tokaji wine==
* Dry Wines: The fine quality dry Tokaji Furmint is a relatively new development in the region. For centuries the main product of the area was the sweet wine, mainly the Botrytised selections. The dry Furmint got into the attention of wine connoisseurs and experts of the world when the Úrágya 2000 single vineyard selection had been introduced by István Szepsy. The wine expressed great minerality, complexity and structure, which has been experienced only in the finest white wines of historic regions like Burgundy or the Mosel before. The aging potential was also promising. In 2003 more producers of Mád village produced single vineyard selected dry Furmint wines with great success. Mád village with its almost 1200 ha had the opportunity to produce high quality dry Furmint wine in significant quantity as a commune level wine, which can express the unique volcanic terroir of the region, this wine is named after its appellation Mad and produced by István Szepsy Jr. in the Szent Tamás Winery.

These wines, once referred to as common, &quot;ordinárium&quot;, are now named after their respective grape varieties: Tokaji Furmint, Tokaji Hárslevelű, Tokaji Sárgamuskotály and Tokaji Kövérszőlő.

* Szamorodni: This type of wine was initially known as &quot;főbor&quot; (prime wine), but from the 1820s Polish merchants popularised the name &quot;samorodny&quot;, (The word stems from Slovak, the Prekmurje dialect of Slovene, and Kajkavian Croatian, which used to be spoken before the hungarization of the Pannonian Basin. The word is an adjective and means &quot;self-grown&quot;, &quot;the way it was grown&quot;, or &quot;made by itself&quot;). What sets Szamorodni apart from ordinary wines is that it is made from bunches of grapes which contain a high proportion of botrytised grapes. Szamorodni is typically higher in alcohol than ordinary wine. Szamorodni often contains up to 100-120 g of residual sugar and thus is termed &quot;édes&quot; (sweet). However, when the bunches contain less botrytised grapes, the residual sugar content is much lower, resulting in a &quot;száraz&quot; (dry) wine. Its alcohol content is typically 14%.

* Aszú: This is the world-famous sweet, topaz-colored wine known throughout the English-speaking world as Tokay. The original meaning of the Hungarian word &quot;aszú&quot; was &quot;dried&quot;, but the term aszú came to be associated with the type of wine made with botrytised (i.e. &quot;nobly&quot; rotten) grapes. The process of making Aszú wine is as follows:
** Aszú berries are individually picked, then collected in huge vats and trampled into the consistency of paste (known as aszú dough).
** Must or wine is poured on the aszú dough and left for 24–48 hours, stirred occasionally.
** The wine is racked off into wooden casks or vats where fermentation is completed and the aszú wine is left to mature. The casks are stored in a cool environment, and are not tightly closed, so a slow fermentation process continues in the cask, usually for several years.
: The concentration of aszú was traditionally defined by the number of &quot;puttony&quot; (large baskets, holding about 25 kilograms) of dough added to a Gönc cask (136 liter barrel) of must. Nowadays the &quot;puttony&quot; number is based on the content of sugar and sugar-free extract in the mature wine. Aszú ranges from 3 &quot;puttonyos&quot; to 6 &quot;puttonyos&quot;, with a further category called Aszú-Eszencia representing wines above 6 &quot;puttonyos&quot;. Unlike most other wines, alcohol content of aszú typically runs higher than 14%. Annual production of aszú is less than one percent of the region&#x27;s total output.
* Eszencia: Also called nectar, this is often described as one of the most exclusive wines in the world, although technically it cannot even be called a wine because its enormous concentration of sugar means that its alcohol level never rises above 5-6 percent. Eszencia is the juice of aszú berries which runs off naturally from the vats in which they are collected during harvesting. The sugar concentration of eszencia is typically between 500 g and 700 g per litre, although the year 2000 vintage produced eszencia exceeding 900 g per liter. Eszencia is traditionally added to aszú wines, but may be allowed to ferment (a process that takes at least 4 years to complete) and then bottled pure. The resulting wine has a concentration and intensity of flavor that is unequaled, but is so sweet that it can only be drunk in small quantities. Unlike virtually all other wines, Eszencia maintains its quality and drinkability when stored for 200 years or more.
* Fordítás: (meaning &quot;turning over&quot; in Hungarian), wine made by pouring must on aszú dough which has already been used to make aszú wine.
* Máslás: (derived from the word &quot;copy&quot; in Hungarian), wine made by pouring must on the lees of aszú.
* Other sweet wines: In the past few years reductive sweet wines have begun to appear in Tokaj. These are ready for release a year to 18 months after harvest. They typically contain 50-180 g/L of residual sugar and a ratio of botrytised berries comparable to Aszú wines. They are usually labeled as &quot;késői szüretelésű&quot; (late harvest) wines. Innovative producers have also marketed tokaji wine that does not fit the appellation laws of the above categories but is often of high quality and price, and in many ways comparable to aszú. These wines are often labeled as &quot;tokaji cuvée.&quot;

===Imperial Tokay===
Prior to 1918 (the end of World War I and the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), the finest eszencia Tokaji was not sold but was reserved for the Imperial cellars of the Habsburg monarchy. By the mid 18th century these finest eszencia Tokaji originally held by the Habsburgs were called &quot;Imperial Tokay&quot;. Cases, barrels, and bottles of it often passed between European monarchs as gifts. In 2008, a bottle of Imperial Tokay bearing the seal of the wine cellar of the Royal Saxon Court sold at auction at Christie&#x27;s for £1,955.

==History==

It is not known for how long vines have been grown on the volcanic soil of the fork of the rivers Bodrog and Hernád. This predates the settlement of the Magyar tribes to the region. According to legend, the first aszú was made by Laczkó Máté Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from aszú grapes had already appeared in the &quot;Nomenklatura&quot; of Fabricius Balázs Sziksai which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of aszú predates this reference by five years.

Tokaji wine became the subject of the world&#x27;s first appellation control, established several decades before Port wine, and over 120 years before the classification of Bordeaux. Vineyard classification began in 1730 with vineyards being classified into three categories depending on the soil, sun exposure and potential to develop noble rot, botrytis cinerea, first class, second class and third class wines. A royal decree in 1757 established a closed production district in Tokaj. The classification system was completed by the national censuses of 1765 and 1772.

In 1920, following the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a small part of the Tokaj wine region (approx. 1.75 km2) became part of Czechoslovakia due to the Treaty of Trianon, while the rest remained part of Hungary. After World War II, when Hungary became a Soviet-influenced state, Tokaji production continued with as many as 6,000 small producers, but the bottling and distribution were monopolized by the state-owned organization.
Since the collapse of the communist regimes in 1990, a number of independent wineries have been established in the Tokaj wine region. A state-owned producer continues to exist and handles approximately 20% of the overall production.

==Famous consumers of Tokaji==
Voivode Stephen the Great of Moldavia was said to be a very big fan of Tokay wines. He introduced to Moldavia the Kövérszőlő cultivar, that lead to the development of Grasă de Cotnari wine.

Tokaji has since the 18th century been known as &quot;Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum&quot; (&quot;Wine of Kings, King of Wines&quot;), an epithet sometimes attributed to King Louis XIV of France. In 1703, Francis Rákóczi II, Prince of Transylvania, gave Louis XIV some Tokaji wine from his Tokaj estate as a gift. The Tokaji wine was served at the French Royal court at Versailles, where it became known as Tokay.

Emperor Franz Josef (who was also King of Hungary) had a tradition of sending Queen Victoria Tokaji Aszú wine, as a gift, every year on her birthday, one bottle for every month she had lived, twelve for each year. On her eighty-first and final birthday (1900), this totaled an impressive 972 bottles.

Tokaji wine has received accolades from numerous great writers and composers including Beethoven, Liszt, Schubert, Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich von Schiller, Bram Stoker, Johann Strauss II, and Voltaire. The composer Joseph Haydn&#x27;s favorite wine was Tokaji. Besides Louis XIV, several other European monarchs are known to have been keen consumers of the wine. Louis XV and Frederick the Great tried to outdo one another when they treated guests such as Voltaire with Tokaji. Napoleon III, the last Emperor of the French, ordered 30–40 barrels of Tokaji at the French Royal Court every year. Pope Pius IV (1499–1565) at the Council of Trent in 1562, exclaimed: &quot;Summum pontificem talia vina decent!&quot; (This is the type of wine that should be on the papal table.) Gustav III, King of Sweden, loved Tokaji – it has been said he never had any other wine to drink. In Russia, customers included Peter the Great and Empress Elizabeth of Russia. A newspaper account of the 1933 wedding of Polish president Ignacy Mościcki notes that toasts were made with 250-year-old wines, and goes on to say &quot;The wine, if good, could only have been Essence of Tokay, and the centuries-old friendship between Poland and Hungary would seem to support this conclusion.&quot;

Grand Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn of Lubavitch was known to drink Kosher Tokaji wines on celebratory occasions, such as on completion of his famous series of discourses titled &quot;Vekocho&quot; in the year 1878.

==Other uses of the Tokaji appellation==
Tokaji wines have been famous for a long time, which has resulted in their name being &quot;adopted&quot; by other wines:

* Historically Tokaji was a white wine from the region of Tokaj in the Kingdom of Hungary. Tokaji wine was mentioned as early as 1635 with reference to the sweet dessert aszú (botrytised) wine. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic in the 1880s, wine was grown in Tokaj from various types of mainly white grape varieties. In English and French the spelling &quot;Tokay&quot; was commonly used.
* Under Hungary&#x27;s and Slovakia&#x27;s accession treaty to the European Union, and an earlier 1993 agreement, the &quot;Tokaj&quot; name (including other forms of spelling) has been given Protected Designation of Origin status. From March 2007, wine producers in France and Italy have no longer been allowed to use the &quot;Tokay&quot; or &quot;Tocai&quot; name for their wines, which were made from two unrelated varieties.
** The name &quot;Tokay&quot; came to be used in the Alsace region of France for wines made with the Pinot gris grape, typically as &quot;Tokay d&#x27;Alsace&quot;. Following the 1993 agreement, the name &quot;Tokay Pinot gris&quot; was adopted as an intermediate step, and by 2007 the use of the Tokay part was no longer allowed nor used. Many Alsace producers switched to the name Pinot gris several years before the deadline.
** In Italy the name &quot;Tocai&quot; came to refer to the grape Sauvignon vert from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, under the designation &quot;Tocai Friulano&quot;. It is currently known simply as Friulano.
* In Slovenia, in line with the EU prohibition, the wine of Goriška Brda and Vipava regions was renamed Sauvignonasse.

* There has also been a long-running dispute between Hungary and Slovakia over the right to use the name &quot;Tokaj&quot;. Negotiations between the two governments resulted in an agreement being signed in June 2004. Under this agreement, wine produced on 5.65 km2 of land in Slovakia is allowed to use the &quot;Tokajský/-á/-é&quot; label. However, a number of practical issues remain. Slovakia has pledged to introduce the same standards enshrined in Hungarian wine laws since 1990, but it has not yet been decided who will monitor or enforce those laws. In November 2012, the European Court ruled against Hungary&#x27;s request to erase the Slovak entry &quot;Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj&quot; from &quot;E-Bacchus&quot;, an electronic database containing a register of designations of origin and geographical indications protected in the EU. Hungary lodged an appeal against the judgement of the General Court. In February 2013, the EU Court of Justice has turned down the Hungarian appeal against an earlier ruling concerning Slovakia&#x27;s registration of &quot;Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj&quot; (Tokaj Wine Region), which contains the name of Hungary&#x27;s Tokaj region. In its ruling, the court said that Slovakia&#x27;s registering its &quot;Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj&quot; in the European database E-Bachus did not constitute an actionable measure. As a result, under the current EU legislation the wine-growing region of Tokaj is located in both Hungary and Slovakia.
* The Rutherglen wine region in Australia produces a dessert wine made from Muscadelle grapes that has usually been referred to as Tokay, but which has little resemblance to the grapes or the processes of Hungarian Tokaji. Following a change in regulations in 2007, this variety of dessert wine has been sold under the name &quot;Topaque&quot; by some wineries, but as of 2012 some others continue to label theirs Tokay.
* Ukraine also produces wines labelled &quot;Tokay,&quot; which are generally produced in Transcarpathia. This wine is made from similar cultivars is bottled in similar 500 mL bottles, but does not necessarily adhere to the same standards; this issue is being negotiated.

==In popular culture==
* In Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, in the scene in the Auerbach&#x27;s Cellar, Mephistopheles offers the other characters a choice of any one wine each, which he then produces by boring holes in the table with a corkscrew. Frosch wishes for Rhine wine, Brander for Champagne, and Siebel wishes for a sweet wine, after which Mephistopheles chooses Tokay for him.
* In the first chapter of Alexander Dumas&#x27; The Queen&#x27;s Necklace (1849, 1850), the Marshal of Richelieu&#x27;s butler makes him wait one hour for lunch, so he can offer a special tokaji wine bottle to the king of Sweden who, under the name Count of Haga, is one of the marshal&#x27;s guest.
* In Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; (1884), the guests at the party in act 1 drink Tokay. In the scene, the main character, Hjalmar Ekdal, is revealed to be quite ignorant of vintage differences of fine wines.
* In chapter four of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; (1890), Thaddeus Sholto offers Miss Morstan Chianti or Tokay, as the only two refreshments he had on hand.
* In Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897), Jonathan Harker is served a bottle of Tokay on his first night in Dracula&#x27;s castle.
* In another Sherlock Holmes story, &quot;His Last Bow&quot; (1917), the German spy Von Bork tells a confederate that &quot;Altamont&quot; (Holmes in disguise) had taken, &quot;a fancy to my Tokay&quot;. Later, Holmes offers Watson a glass, saying, &quot;A remarkable wine, Watson. Our friend upon the sofa has assured me that it is from Franz Josef’s special cellar at the Schönbrunn Palace&quot;.
* Imperial Tokay is served in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;.
* A bottle of &quot;genuine imperial Tokay&quot; plays a prominent part in the Lord Peter Wimsey short story &quot;The Bibulous Business of a Matter of Taste&quot; (1928), which centers on identifying wines by taste. It is described as &#x27;both sweet and coarse&#x27; and as &#x27;horribly over-rated&#x27;.
* The occult novel &quot;Moonchild&quot;, published in 1929 by the notorious Aleister Crowley, features a feast in Chapter IV with several rare wines, including &quot;a Tokay that really was Imperial&quot;.
* In H. Warner Allen&#x27;s short story &quot;Tokay of the Comet Year&quot; (1930), a rare Tokay features prominently in a complex plot involving spies and a missing treaty.
* Sniffing the aromatic essence of Tokaji, as well as its sympathetic effect upon being imbibed, serves as an important and amusing plot device in the 1936 novel &quot;My Talks with Dean Spanley&quot;, by Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany. The 2008 film adaptation of the novel, &quot;Dean Spanley&quot; also features this device.
* In Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1959 poem, October in the Railroad Earth, Kerouac is described as enjoying &quot;a fifth of Tokay, no tea&quot; on the weekend when not working at the railyard. In Kerouac’s 1957 novel On the Road he writes, “Another hour it would come streaming through the Golden Gate to shroud the romantic city in white, and a young man would hold his girl by the hand and climb slowly up a long white sidewalk with a bottle of Tokay in his pocket.”
* In Terry Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988), the Baron and the Sultan make a wager over whether the Baron can obtain, from &quot;the imperial cellars at Vienna,&quot; a bottle of Tokaji superior to that proffered by the Sultan.
* In Philip Pullman&#x27;s novel &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (1995, also known as &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;), there is an attempted poisoning by the Master of Jordan College (the novel and television series) or an official of the Magisterium (the film) of one of the major characters, Lord Asriel, via a decanter of Tokaji (spelt &#x27;Tokay&#x27;) in the first chapter, titled &quot;The Decanter of Tokay&quot;. Tokaji is said to be Lord Asriel&#x27;s favorite wine.
* In the eighth episode &quot;The Hobo Code&quot; (2007) of the American television series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Don Draper argues with a beatnik. When the beatnik says advertising &quot;won&#x27;t bring back those ten dead kids in Biloxi,&quot; Don replies that &quot;neither will buying some Tokaj wine and leaning up against a wall in Grand Central pretending you&#x27;re a vagrant.&quot;
* In Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, the titular character Erik offers Christine Daae a meal consisting of Tokay during her first visit to his home beneath the Paris Opera House. 
* In the Traveller science fiction role-playing game Tokaj Escenzia (aka Tokaji Essencia) is considered such a fine wine that the entirety of Earth&#x27;s production of it is reserved for the sole use of the Emperor of the interstellar Third Imperium. A famous event aboard an Azhanti High Lightning class cruiser involved an attempt to steal the Emperor&#x27;s wine shipment.

<text>Charles Francis Richter (; April 26, 1900September 30, 1985) was an American seismologist and physicist. He is the namesake and one of the creators of the Richter scale, which, until the development of the moment magnitude scale in 1979, was widely used to quantify the size of earthquakes. Inspired by Kiyoo Wadati&#x27;s 1928 paper on shallow and deep earthquakes, Richter first used the scale in 1935 after developing it in collaboration with Beno Gutenberg; both worked at the California Institute of Technology.

==Childhood and education==
Richter was born in Overpeck, Ohio. Richter had German heritage: his great-grandfather was a Forty-Eighter, coming from Baden-Baden (today in Baden-Württemberg, Germany) in 1848 in the wake of the German revolutions of 1848–1849. Richter&#x27;s parents Frederick William and Lillian Anna (Kinsinger) Richter, were divorced when he was very young. He grew up with his maternal grandfather, who moved the family (including his mother) to Los Angeles in 1909. After graduating from Los Angeles High School he attended Stanford University and received his undergraduate degree in 1920. In 1928, he began work on his PhD in theoretical physics from the California Institute of Technology, but, before he finished it, he was offered a position at the Carnegie Institute of Washington. At this point, he became fascinated with seismology (the study of earthquakes and the waves they produce in the earth). Thereafter, he worked at the new Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena, under the direction of Beno Gutenberg. In 1932, Richter and Gutenberg developed a standard scale to measure the relative sizes of earthquake sources, called the Richter scale. In 1937, he returned to the California Institute of Technology, where he spent the rest of his career, eventually becoming professor of seismology in 1952.

==Career==
Richter went to work at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1927 after Robert Andrews Millikan offered him a position as a research assistant there, where he began a collaboration with Beno Gutenberg. The Seismology Lab at the California Institute of Technology wanted to begin publishing regular reports on earthquakes in southern California and had a pressing need for a system of measuring the strength of earthquakes for these reports. Together, Richter and Gutenberg devised the scale that would become known at the Richter scale to fill this need, based on measuring quantitatively the displacement of the earth by seismic waves, as Kiyoo Wadati had suggested.

The pair designed a seismograph that measured this displacement and developed a logarithmic scale to measure intensity. The name &quot;magnitude&quot; for this measurement came from Richter&#x27;s childhood interest in astronomy – astronomers measure the intensity of stars in magnitudes. Gutenberg&#x27;s contribution was substantial, but his aversion to interviews contributed to his name being left off the scale. After the publication of the proposed scale in 1935, seismologists quickly adopted it for use in measuring the intensity of earthquakes.

Richter remained at the Carnegie Institution until 1936, when he obtained a post at the California Institute of Technology, where Beno Gutenberg worked. Gutenberg and Richter published &quot;Seismicity of the Earth&quot; in 1941. Its revised edition, published in 1954, is considered a standard reference in the field.

Richter became a full professor at the California Institute of Technology in 1952. In 1958, he published &quot;Elementary Seismology&quot; based on his undergraduate teaching notes. As Richter seldom published in peer reviewed scientific journals, that is often considered his most important contribution to seismology. Richter spent 1959 and 1960 in Japan as a Fulbright scholar. Around this time in his career, he became involved in earthquake engineering through development of building codes for earthquake prone areas. The city government of Los Angeles removed many ornaments and cornices from municipal buildings in the 1960s as a result of Richter&#x27;s awareness campaigns.

After the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, the city cited Richter&#x27;s warnings as important in preventing many deaths. Richter had retired in 1970.

==Richter magnitude scale==
At the time when Richter began a collaboration with Gutenberg, the only way to rate shocks was a scale developed in 1902 by the Italian priest and geologist Giuseppe Mercalli. The Mercalli scale uses Roman numerals and classifies earthquakes from I to XII, depending on how buildings and people responded to the tremor. A shock that set chandeliers swinging might rate as a I or II on this scale, while one that destroyed huge buildings and created panic in a crowded city might count as an X. The obvious problem with the Mercalli scale was that it relied on subjective measures of how well a building had been constructed and how used to these sorts of crises the population was. The Mercalli scale also made it difficult to rate earthquakes that happened in remote, sparsely populated areas.

The scale developed by Richter and Gutenberg (which became known by Richter&#x27;s name only) was instead an absolute measure of an earthquake&#x27;s intensity. Richter used a seismograph, an instrument generally consisting of a constantly unwinding roll of paper, anchored to a fixed place, and a pendulum or magnet suspended with a marking device above the roll, to record actual earth motion during an earthquake. The scale takes into account the instrument&#x27;s distance from the epicenter, or the point on the ground that is directly above the earthquake&#x27;s origin.

Richter chose to use the term &quot;magnitude&quot; to describe an earthquake&#x27;s strength because of his early interest in astronomy; stargazers use the word to describe the brightness of stars. Gutenberg suggested that the scale be logarithmic so an earthquake of magnitude 7 would be ten times stronger than a 6, a hundred times stronger than a 5, and a thousand times stronger than a 4. (The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that shook San Francisco was magnitude 6.9.) The quote &quot;logarithmic plots are a device of the devil&quot; is attributed to Richter.

The Richter scale was published in 1935 and immediately became the standard measure of earthquake intensity. Richter did not seem concerned that Gutenberg&#x27;s name was not included at first; but in later years, after Gutenberg was already dead, Richter began to insist for his colleague to be recognized for expanding the scale to apply to earthquakes all over the globe, not just in southern California. Since 1935, several other magnitude scales have been developed.

==Personal life==
Richter was an active and avowed naturist. He travelled to many Naturist resorts with his wife, who died in 1972.

At his retirement party, a group of Caltech colleagues called the &quot;Quidnuncs&quot; played and sang a ditty titled &quot;Richter Scale&quot;, which told in ballad style of earthquakes in American history. Richter was initially shy about the song, thinking it demeaned science. However, the author of the song, Kent Clark, stated in a 1989 interview that eventually Richter enjoyed it.

Richter died of congestive heart failure on September 30, 1985, in Pasadena, California. He is buried in Altadena, California&#x27;s Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum.

<doc id="230733" wikidata="Q1723031" url="?curid=230733" title="Prime Minister of Portugal">
<text>The prime minister of Portugal (; ) is the head of government of Portugal. As head of government, the prime minister coordinates the actions of ministers, represents the Government of Portugal to the other bodies of state, is accountable to parliament and keeps the president informed. The prime minister can hold the role of head of government with the portfolio of one or more ministries. As Portugal is a semi-presidential parliamentary republic, the prime minister is the country&#x27;s leading political figure and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive.

There is no limit to the number of terms a person can serve as prime minister. The prime minister is appointed by the president following legislative elections, after having heard the parties represented in the parliament. Usually, the person named is the leader of the largest party in the previous election, but there have been exceptions over the years.

== History ==
Since the Middle Ages, some officers of the Portuguese Crown gained precedence over the others, serving as a kind of prime ministers. Over time, the role of principal officer of the Crown fell upon the &quot;chanceler-mor&quot; (chancellor), the &quot;mordomo-mor&quot; (mayor of the palace) and the &quot;escrivão da puridade&quot; (king&#x27;s private secretary).

The first modern prime minister of Portugal was Pedro de Sousa Holstein, 1st Duke of Palmela, who was sworn in on 24 September 1834, as &quot;Presidente do Conselho de Ministros&quot; (President of the Council of Ministers). In 1911, the official title of the prime minister became &quot;Presidente do Ministério&quot; (President of the Ministry). In 1933, it became again &quot;Presidente do Conselho de Ministros&quot;.

The present title &quot;Primeiro-Ministro&quot; (Prime Minister), attributed to the head of the Government of Portugal, was officially established by the Constitution of 1976 after the revolution of 25 April 1974

== Officeholders ==
The incumbent prime minister of Portugal is Luís Montenegro, who took office on 2 April 2024 as the 14th prime minister of the Third Portuguese Republic. The official residence of the prime minister is the Palacete de São Bento, a mansion next to São Bento Palace, which, in confusion, is sometimes also called &quot;São Bento Palace&quot;.

Portuguese prime ministers of the Third Portuguese Republic:
* 1st Mário Soares (two terms);
* 2nd Alfredo Nobre da Costa;
* 3rd Carlos Mota Pinto;
* 4th Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo;
* 5th Francisco Sá Carneiro;
* (interim) Diogo Freitas do Amaral – Deputy Prime Minister;
* 6th Francisco Pinto Balsemão (two terms);
* 1st Mário Soares (third term);
* 7th Aníbal Cavaco Silva (three terms);
* 8th António Guterres (two terms);
* 9th José Manuel Barroso;
* 10th Pedro Santana Lopes;
* 11th José Sócrates (two terms);
* 12th Passos Coelho (two terms);
* 13th António Costa (three terms);
* 14th Luís Montenegro;

==Prime minister&#x27;s residence==
Just behind the main building of the Assembly of the Republic, there is a mansion that serves as residence and office for the prime minister of Portugal. The mansion, dated from 1877, was built within the garden of the old monastery that held the Portuguese parliament. It has been the prime minister&#x27;s official residence since 1938, when Salazar moved in. Although it is the official residence of the prime minister, not all incumbents have lived in the mansion during their term in office.

==Historical rankings of prime ministers==
In 2012 and 2014 newspaper &quot;i&quot; and the polling agency Pitagórica conducted polls asking for the best Portuguese prime minister among the seven most recent ones (i.e. in the previous 30 years). The results revealed that the public clearly separated the seven evaluated prime ministers between the three best ones (each receiving more than 20% of the votes) and the four worst (each receiving from 4 to 8% of the votes). In both polls, António Guterres (1995–2002) ranked as the best prime minister. Mário Soares (1976–78 and 1983–85) and Aníbal Cavaco Silva (1985–95) were also among the best prime ministers. On the other hand, José Manuel Durão Barroso (2002–04), Pedro Santana Lopes (2004–05), José Sócrates (2005–11) and Pedro Passos Coelho (2011–15, incumbent at the time of the polls) ranked as the worst prime ministers. Pedro Santana Lopes was ranked the worst in the 2012 poll while Barroso ranked as the worst in the 2014 one. Together, the three best prime ministers ruled Portugal uninterruptedly from 1983 to 2002, while the four worst ruled from 2002 to 2015.

<doc id="230735" wikidata="Q2623919" url="?curid=230735" title="Cost-of-production theory of value">
<text>In economics, the cost-of-production theory of value is the theory that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production (including labor, capital, or land) and taxation.

The theory makes the most sense under assumptions of constant returns to scale and the existence of just one non-produced factor of production. With these assumptions, minimal price theorem, a dual version of the so-called non-substitution theorem by Paul Samuelson, holds. Under these assumptions, the long-run price of a commodity is equal to the sum of the cost of the inputs into that commodity, including interest charges.

==Historical development of the theory==
Historically, the best-known proponent of such theories is probably Adam Smith. Piero Sraffa, in his introduction to the first volume of the &quot;Collected Works of David Ricardo&quot;, referred to Smith&#x27;s &quot;adding-up&quot; theory. Smith contrasted natural prices with market price. Smith theorized that market prices would tend toward natural prices, where outputs would stand at what he characterized as the &quot;level of effectual demand&quot;. At this level, Smith&#x27;s natural prices of commodities are the sum of the natural rates of wages, profits, and rent that must be paid for inputs into production. (Smith is ambiguous about whether rent is price determining or price determined. The latter view is the consensus of later classical economists, with the Ricardo-Malthus-West theory of rent.)

David Ricardo mixed this cost-of-production theory of prices with the labor theory of value, as that latter theory was understood by Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and others. This is the theory that prices tend toward proportionality to the socially necessary labor embodied in a commodity. Ricardo sets this theory at the start of the first chapter of his &quot;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot;, but contextualizes it as only relating to commodities with elastic supply. Taknaga advances a new interpretation that Ricardo had cost-of-production theory of value from the start and presents a more coherent interpretation based on texts of &quot;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot;. This alleged refutation leads to what later became known as the transformation problem. Karl Marx later takes up that theory in the first volume of &quot;Capital&quot;, while indicating that he is quite aware that the theory is untrue at lower levels of abstraction. This has led to all sorts of arguments over what both David Ricardo and Karl Marx &quot;really meant&quot;. Nevertheless, it seems undeniable that all the major classical economics and Marx explicitly rejected the labor theory of price().

A somewhat different theory of cost-determined prices is provided by the &quot;neo-Ricardian School&quot; of Piero Sraffa and his followers. Yoshnori Shiozawa presented a modern interpretation of Ricardo&#x27;s cost-of-production theory of value.

The Polish economist Michał Kalecki distinguished between sectors with &quot;cost-determined prices&quot; (such as manufacturing and services) and those with &quot;demand-determined prices&quot; (such as agriculture and raw material extraction).

==Market price==

Market price is a familiar economic concept: it is the price that a good or service is offered at, or will fetch, in the marketplace. It is of interest mainly in the study of microeconomics. Market value and market price are equal only under conditions of market efficiency, equilibrium, and rational expectations.

In economics, &quot;returns to scale&quot; and &quot;economies of scale&quot; are related terms that describe what happens as the scale of production increases. They are different, non-interchangeable concepts.

==Labor theory of value==

The labor theories of value are economic theories according to which the true values of commodities are related to the labor needed to produce them.

There are many accounts of labor value, with the common element that the &quot;value&quot; of an exchangeable good or service is, or ought to be, or tends to be, or can be considered as, equal or proportional to the amount of labor required to produce it (including the labor required to produce the raw materials and machinery used in production).

Different labor theories of value prevailed among classical economists through the mid-19th century. This theory is especially associated with Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Since that time, it has been most often associated with Marxian economics, while among modern mainstream economists it is considered to be superseded by the marginal utility approach.

==Taxes and subsidies==

Taxes and subsidies change the price of goods and services. A marginal tax on the sellers of a good will shift the supply curve to the left until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit tax; other things remaining equal, this will increase the price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and decrease the price received by the sellers. Marginal subsidies on production will shift the supply curve to the right until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit subsidy; other things remaining equal, this will decrease price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and increase the price received by the producers.

<text>Serbian epic poetry () is a form of epic poetry created by Serbs originating in today&#x27;s Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia. The main cycles were composed by unknown Serb authors between the 14th and 19th centuries. They are largely concerned with historical events and personages. The instrument accompanying the epic poetry is the &quot;gusle&quot;.

Serbian epic poetry helped in developing the Serbian national consciousness. The cycles of Prince Marko, the Hajduks and Uskoks inspired the Serbs to restore freedom and their heroic past. The Hajduks in particular, are seen as an integral part of national identity; in stories, the hajduks were heroes: they had played the role of the Serbian elite during Ottoman rule, they had defended the Serbs against Ottoman oppression, and prepared for the national liberation and contributed to it in the Serbian Revolution.

==History==
The earliest surviving record of an epic poem related to Serbian epic poetry is a ten verse fragment of a bugarštica song from 1497 in Southern Italy about the imprisonment of Sibinjanin Janko (John Hunyadi) by Đurađ Branković, however the regional origin and ethnic identity of its Slavic performers remains a matter of scholarly dispute. From at least the Ottoman period up until the present day, Serbian epic poetry was sung accompanied by the &quot;gusle&quot; and there are historical references to Serb performers playing the gusle at the Polish–Lithuanian royal courts in the 16th and 17th centuries, and later on in Ukraine and Hungary. Hungarian historian Sebestyén Tinódi wrote in 1554 that &quot;there are many gusle players here in Hungary, but none is better at the Serbian style than Dimitrije Karaman&quot;, and described Karaman&#x27;s performance to Turkish lord Uluman in 1551 in Lipova: the guslar would hold the gusle between his knees and go into a highly emotional artistic performance with a sad and dedicated expression on his face. Chronicler and poet Maciej Stryjkowski (1547–1582) included a verse mentions the Serbs singing heroic songs about ancestors fighting the Turks in his 1582 chronicle. Józef Bartłomiej Zimorowic used the phrase &quot;to sing to the Serbian gusle&quot; in his 1663 idyll &quot;Śpiewacy&quot; (Singers).

In 1824, Vuk Karadžić sent a copy of his folksong collection to Jacob Grimm, who was particularly enthralled by &quot;The Building of Skadar&quot;. Grimm translated it into German, and described it as &quot;one of the most touching poems of all nations and all times&quot;.

Many of the epics are about the era of the Ottoman occupation of Serbia and the struggle for the liberation. With the efforts of ethnographer Vuk Karadžić, many of these epics and folk tales were collected and published in books in the first half of the 19th century. Up until that time, these poems and songs had been almost exclusively an oral tradition, transmitted by bards and singers. Among the books Karadžić published were:

*A Small Simple-Folk Slavonic-Serbian Songbook, 1814; Serbian Folk Song-Book (Vols, I-IV, Leipzig edition, 1823-8133; Vols. I-IV, Vienna edition, 1841-1862)
*Serbian Folk Tales (1821, with 166 riddles; and 1853)
*Serbian Folk Proverbs and Other Common Expressions, 1834.
*&quot;Women&#x27;s Songs&quot; from Herzegovina (1866) - which was collected by Karadžić&#x27;s collaborator and assistant Vuk Vrčević

These editions appeared in Europe when romanticism was in full bloom and there was much interest in Serbian folk poetry, including from Johann Gottfried Herder, Jacob Grimm, Goethe and Jernej Kopitar.

==Gusle==
The &quot;gusle&quot; () instrumentally accompanies heroic songs (epic poetry) in the Balkans. The instrument is held vertically between the knees, with the left hand fingers on the neck. The strings are never pressed to the neck, giving a harmonic and unique sound. There is no consensus about the origin of the instrument, while some researchers believe it was brought with the Slavs to the Balkans, based on a 6th-century Byzantine source. Teodosije the Hilandarian (1246–1328) wrote that Stefan Nemanjić (r. 1196–1228) often entertained the Serbian nobility with musicians with drums and &quot;gusle&quot;. Reliable written records about the &quot;gusle&quot; appear only in the 15th century. 16th-century travel memoirs mention the instrument in Bosnia and Serbia.

It is known that Serbs sang to the &quot;gusle&quot; during the Ottoman period. Notable Serbian performers played at the Polish royal courts in the 16th- and 17th centuries, and later on in Ukraine and in Hungary. There is an old mention in Serbo-Croatian literature that a Serbian guslar was present at the court of Władysław II Jagiełło in 1415. In a poem published in 1612, Kasper Miaskowski wrote that &quot;the Serbian gusle and gaidas will overwhelm Shrove Tuesday&quot;. Józef Bartłomiej Zimorowic used the phrase &quot;to sing to the Serbian gusle&quot; in his 1663 idyll &quot;Śpiewacy&quot; (&quot;Singers&quot;).

==Corpus==
The corpus of Serbian epic poetry is divided into cycles:
*Non-historic cycle (Неисторијски циклус/Neistorijski ciklus) - poems about Slavic mythology, characteristically about dragons and nymphs
*Pre-Kosovo cycle (Преткосовски циклус/Pretkosovski ciklus) - poems about events that predate the Battle of Kosovo (1389)
*Kosovo cycle (Косовски циклус/Kosovski ciklus) - poems about events that happened just before and after the Battle of Kosovo
*Post-Kosovo cycle (Покосовски циклус/Pokosovski ciklus) - poems about post-Battle events
*Cycle of Kraljević Marko (Циклус Краљевића Марка/Ciklus Kraljevića Marka)
*Cycle of hajduks and uskoks (Хајдучки и ускочки циклус, Хајдучке и ускочке песме) – poems about brigands and rebels
*Poems about the liberation of Serbia and Montenegro (циклус ослобођења Србије, Песме о ослобођењу Србије и Црне Горе) - poems about the 19th-century battles against the Ottomans
*Unsorted (Неразврстане/Nerazvrstane) – poems that do not belong to any of the cycles mentioned above

Poems depict historical events with varying degrees of accuracy.

==Notable people==
* Benedikt Kuripečič (16th century), diplomat who traveled through Ottoman Bosnia and Serbia in 1530 and recorded that epic songs about Miloš Obilić are popular not only among Serbs in Kosovo but also in Bosnia and Croatia. He also recorded some legends about the Battle of Kosovo.
* Dimitrije Karaman ( 1551), oldest known Serbian gusle player
* Avram Miletić (1755–after 1826), merchant and songwriter best known for writing the earliest collection of urban lyric poetry in Serbian.
* Old Rashko, one of the most important sources of epic poetry recorded by Vuk Karadžić.
* Filip Višnjić (1767–1834), Serbian guslar dubbed the &quot;Serbian Homer&quot; both for his blindness and poetic gift.
* Tešan Podrugović (1783–1815), Serb hajduk, storyteller and guslar who participated in the First Serbian Uprising and was one of the most important sources for Serbian epic poetry.
* Živana Antonijević (d. 1822), known as &quot;Blind Živana&quot;, one of the favorite female singers of Vuk Karadžić.
* Vuk Karadžić (1787—1864) was a Serbian philologist and linguist who was the major reformer of the Serbian language. He deserves, perhaps, for his collections of songs, fairy tales, and riddles to be called the father of the study of Serbian folklore.
*Vuk Vrčević (1811-1882), collector of lyric poetry
* Petar Perunović (1880–1952), known as &quot;Perun&quot;, famous guslar who performed for Nikola Tesla and the first to record Serbian epic poetry in a studio.

==Modern Serbian epic poetry==
Epic poetry is recorded still today. Some modern songs are published in books or recorded, and under copyright, but some are in public domain, and modified by subsequent authors just like old ones. There are new songs that mimic old epic poetry, but are humorous and not epic in nature; these are also circulating around with no known author. In the latter half of the 19th century, a certain MP would exit the Serbian parliament each day, and tell of the debate over the monetary reform bill in the style of epic poetry. Modern epic heroes include: Radovan Karadžić, Ratko Mladić and Vojislav Šešelj. Topics include: Yugoslav wars, NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and the Hague Tribunal.

Popular modern Serbian epic performers, &quot;guslari&quot; (Guslars) include: Milomir &quot;Miljan&quot; Miljanić, Đoko Koprivica, Boško Vujačić, Vlastimir Barać, Sava Stanišić, Miloš Šegrt, Saša Laketić and Milan Mrdović.

<text>The Saulteaux (pronounced , or in imitation of the French pronunciation , also written Salteaux, Saulteau and other variants), otherwise known as the Plains Ojibwe, are a First Nations band government in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. They are a branch of the Ojibwe who pushed west. They formed a mixed culture of woodlands and plains Indigenous customs and traditions.

==Ethnic classification==
The Saulteaux are a branch of the Ojibwe Nations within Canada. They are sometimes called the Anihšināpē (Anishinaabe). &quot;Saulteaux&quot; is a French term meaning &#x27;waters (&quot;eaux&quot;) - fall (&quot;sault&quot;)&#x27;, and by extension &quot;People of the rapids/water falls&quot;, referring to their former location in the area of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, on the St. Marys River (Michigan–Ontario) which connects Lake Superior with Lake Huron. They are primarily hunters and fishers, and when still the primary dwellers of their sovereign land, they had extensive trading relations with the French, British and later Americans at that post.

==Location==
The Saulteaux historically were settled around Lake Superior and Lake Winnipeg, principally in the areas of present-day Sault Ste. Marie and northern Michigan. Pressure from European Canadians and Americans gradually pushed the tribe westward to Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, with one community in British Columbia. Today most of the Saulteaux live in the Interlake District; Swan River, Duck Bay, Camperville, the southern part of Manitoba, and in Saskatchewan (Kamsack and surrounding areas). Because they were forced to move to land ill-suited for European crops, they were lucky to escape European-Canadian competition for their lands and have kept much of that assigned territory in reserves. Generally, the Saulteaux have three major divisions.

===Ontario Saulteaux===
The Eastern Saulteaux, better known as the Ontario Saulteaux, are located around Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods in Northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba. Many of the Ontario Saulteaux First Nations are signatories to Treaty 3. Their form of &quot;Anishinaabemowin&quot; (Anishinaabe language) is sometimes called Northwestern Ojibwa language (ISO 639-3: OJB), or simply &quot;Ojibwemowin&quot; (Ojibwe). Today English is the first language of many members. The Ontario Saulteaux culture is descended from the Eastern Woodlands culture.

===Manitoba Saulteaux===
The Central Saulteaux, better known as Manitoba Saulteaux, are found primarily in eastern and southern Manitoba, extending west into southern Saskatchewan. During the late 18th century and early 19th century, as partners with the Cree in the fur trade, the Saulteaux migrated northwest into the Swan River and Cumberland districts of west-central Manitoba, and into Saskatchewan along the Assiniboine River, as far its confluence with the Souris (Mouse) River. Once established in the area, the Saulteaux adapted some of the cultural traits of their allies, the Plains Cree and Assiniboine.

Consequently, together with the Western Saulteaux, the Manitoba Saulteaux are sometimes called Plains Ojibwe. Many of the Manitoba Saulteaux First Nations are signatories to Treaty 1 and Treaty 2. The Manitoba Saulteaux culture is a transitional one from the Eastern Woodlands culture of their Ontario Saulteaux neighbours and Plains culture of the Western Saulteaux neighbours. Often, the term &quot;Bungi&quot; or &quot;Bungee&quot; (from &quot;bangii,&quot; meaning &quot;a little bit&quot;) has been used to refer to either the Manitoba Saulteaux (who resemble the Cree in culture) or their Métis population (who are a little bit Anishinaabe). The language of their Métis population is described as the Bungi language.

===Western Saulteaux===
The Western Saulteaux are found primarily in central Saskatchewan, but extend east into southwestern Manitoba and west into central Alberta and eastern British Columbia. They call themselves ()—an autonym that is a general term for the Saulteaux. The neighbouring Plains Cree call them the (), a word of related etymology. Their form of (Anishinaabe language), known as () or Western Ojibwa language (ISO 639-3: OJW), is also an Algonquian language. Like most First Nations, most members use English as the first language. Many of the Western Saulteaux First Nations are signatories to Treaty 4 and Treaty 6; Saulteau First Nations in North Eastern British Columbia are a signatory to Treaty 8. The Western Saulteaux culture is that of the Plains culture.

<doc id="230751" wikidata="Q364153" url="?curid=230751" title="Gerard Reve">
<text>Gerard Kornelis van het Reve (14 December 1923 – 8 April 2006) was a Dutch writer. He started writing as Simon Gerard van het Reve and adopted the shorter Gerard Reve in 1973. Together with Willem Frederik Hermans and Harry Mulisch, he is considered one of the &quot;Great Three&quot; (&quot;De Grote Drie&quot;) of Dutch post-war literature. His 1981 novel &quot;De vierde man&quot; (The Fourth Man) was the basis for Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s 1983 film.

Reve was one of the first homosexual authors to come out in the Netherlands. He often wrote explicitly about erotic attraction, sexual relations and intercourse between men, which many readers considered shocking. However, he did this in an ironic, humorous and recognizable way, which contributed to making homosexuality acceptable for many of his readers. Another main theme, often in combination with eroticism, was religion. Reve himself declared that the primary message in all of his work was salvation from the material world we live in.

Gerard Reve was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and was the brother of the Slavicist and essayist Karel van het Reve, who became a staunch anti-communist in his own way; the personal rapport between the brothers was not good. They broke off relations altogether in the 1980s.

== Themes ==

He often insisted that homosexuality was merely a motif (providing idiom – as Roman Catholicism based phrases would differ from e.g. Buddhist wording – and, over time, idiosyncratic Reve-slang) in his work, the deeper theme being the inadequacy of human love (as opposed to divine love). Since the publication of &quot;Op weg naar het einde&quot; (Towards the end) (1963) and &quot;Nader tot U&quot; (Nearer to Thee) (1966), marking his breakthrough to a large audience, he articulated his views on God&#x27;s creation and human fate, especially in the many collections of letters that he published.

These writings stress a symbolic, rather than (&quot;...only the blind...&quot;) literal, understanding of religious texts as the only intellectually acceptable one, and the irrelevance of the Gospel&#x27;s historical truth. Religion, according to Reve, has nothing to do with the literal, the factual, the moral or the political. It has no quarrel with modern science, because religious truths and empirical facts are in different realms. The observable world has no meaning beyond comparing facts, and, while revelation may not make sense, it has meaning, and it is this meaning that Reve was after in everything he wrote. Philosophically, Reve was influenced by Arthur Schopenhauer, whose works he re-read every winter, and even more so by Carl Jung, according to a Dutch painter who spent some time with the author in France to paint several portraits of him.

Reve&#x27;s erotic prose deals partly with his own sexuality, but aims at something more universal. Reve&#x27;s work often depicts sexuality as ritual. Heavily influenced by French writer Marquis de Sade, many scenes bear a sado-masochistic character, but this is never meant as an end in itself. &#x27;Revism&#x27;, a term coined by him, can roughly be described as consecrating sexual acts of punishment, dedicating these acts to revered others, and, ultimately, to higher entities (God). This is again a quest for higher significance in a human act (sex) that is devoid of meaning in its material form.

== Style ==
His style combines the formal (in the kind of language one would find in a seventeenth-century Bible) with the colloquial, in a highly recognisable way. Similarly, his humour and often paradoxical view of the world relies on the contrast between exalted mysticism and common sense. The irony that pervades his work and his tendency towards extreme statements has caused confusion among readers. Many doubted the sincerity of his conversion to Catholicism, although Reve remained adamant about the truthfulness of his faith, claiming his right to individual notions about religion and his personal experience of it.

== International reception ==
The year 2016 saw Sam Garret&#x27;s translation of Reve&#x27;s debut, &quot;The Evenings&quot;. Although Reve was long thought to be untranslatable because of his stylistic brilliance, the work received critical acclaim throughout the English speaking world. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Tim Parks opened his review as follows:It is so rare, as a reviewer, to come across a novel that is not only a masterpiece but a cornerstone manque of modern European literature, that I hesitate before setting down a response: what can I say, in a world of hype, that will put this book where it belongs, in readers’ hands and minds?

== Controversies ==
Reve&#x27;s literary career was marked by many controversies. Early on, the Dutch ministry of culture intervened when Reve was to receive a grant, citing the obscene nature of his work.

A member of the Dutch senate, the Calvinist senator Hendrik Algra, spoke on the same subject in a plenary debate. Reve sometimes welcomed the publicity, but also complained about his continual struggle with the authorities, public opinion and the press.

Reve was prosecuted in 1966 for allegedly breaking a law against blasphemy. In &quot;Nader tot U&quot; he describes the narrator&#x27;s love-making to God, a visitor to his house incarnated in a one-year-old mouse-grey donkey. In April 1968 he was acquitted by the Supreme Court. Although it would take decades for the Netherlands to decriminalize blasphemy, in 2013 the law was abolished, the outcome of this case — known as the “Donkey Trial” — rendered the existing law virtually obsolete 

Reve came from a communist and atheistic family, but converted to Roman Catholicism. Although liturgically traditional, he took a liberal stance on Roman Catholic ethics. His ridiculing of some aspects of Catholicism led to tensions in the Dutch Roman Catholic community in the 1960s. Nevertheless, he contributed as a literary advisor to the translation of St. Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans within the larger context of the Dutch &#x27;Willibrord Translation&#x27; of the Bible.

One of Reve&#x27;s main themes, along with religion and love, is his intense hatred of communism, its regimes and the tolerance toward it in leftist circles in the western world.

In 1975, he appeared at a Dutch poetry festival, wearing (among other things, a crucifix and peace symbol) a swastika as well as a hammer and sickle on his clothes, and read a poem that spoke of immigration in racist terms, though stressing cultural differences and using &quot;zwart&quot; (black) rather than &quot;neger/nikker&quot; (negro/nigger), in a solemn language that insulted many people, especially Afro-Surinamese, many of whom had arrived recently on the eve of the decolonization of Surinam that was to take place in November 1975.

This event led to much controversy, and many people have since wondered whether Reve had lost his mind, or had been alluding to something else. In the face of a wave of criticism Reve did not move an inch, and his claims of being &#x27;too intelligent to be a racist&#x27; and never wanting to inflict any harm on any racial grounds partly got lost in the confusion generated by his ever-present irony.

Like WF Hermans, he invited controversy by visiting South Africa in 1984 in defiance of a cultural boycott that was declared on that country because of its apartheid policy.

In 2001, he was awarded the Prijs der Nederlandse Letteren, the most prestigious prize for Dutch-language authors, but King Albert II of Belgium refused to present it to him because his partner had been accused of pedophilia. The money was awarded by bank transfer and the certificate delivered.

During the last years of his life, he began to suffer from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and he died of it, in Zulte, Belgium, on 8 April 2006 at the age of 82. Reve was buried on April 15 in the centre of the cemetery &quot;Nieuwe Begraafplaats&quot; in Machelen-aan-de-Leie.

<text>A paragraph () is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. Though not required by the orthographic conventions of any language with a writing system, paragraphs are a conventional means of organizing extended segments of prose.

==History==

The oldest classical British and Latin writings had little or no space between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized. Word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original &#x27;, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group. The Greek &#x27; evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. 
Ancient manuscripts also divided sentences into paragraphs with line breaks (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly. Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph white space, or put in the indentation space.

A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create &quot;block paragraphs.&quot; On a typewriter, a double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or word processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email. Wikipedia itself employs this format.

==Typographical considerations==
Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should &quot;Set opening paragraphs flush left.&quot; Bringhurst explains as follows:

The function of a paragraph is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.

&quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot; states that &quot;at least one en [space]&quot; should be used to indent paragraphs after the first, noting that that is the &quot;practical minimum&quot;. An em space is the most commonly used paragraph indent. Miles Tinker, in his book &quot;Legibility of Print&quot;, concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases readability by 7%, on average.

When referencing a paragraph, typographic symbol may be used: &quot;See § Background&quot;.

In modern usage, paragraph initiation is typically indicated by one or more of a preceding blank line, indentation, an &quot;Initial&quot; (&quot;drop cap&quot;) or other indication. Historically, the pilcrow symbol() was used in Latin and western European languages. Other languages have their own marks with similar function.

Widows and orphans occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.

==In computing==

In word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical white space or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.

How such documents are actually stored depends on the file format. For example, HTML uses the &lt;p&gt; tag as a paragraph container. In plaintext files, there are two common formats. The pre-formatted text will have a newline at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line. An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.

A line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a paragraph break, although this is typically not done in prose. HTML&#x27;s &lt;br /&gt; tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the W3C recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each &quot;paragraph&quot; is a stanza), or in a street address.

==Numbering==
Paragraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson&#x27;s 1921 &quot;A Course of Modern Analysis&quot;, chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter §9.6 introduces Riemann&#x27;s theory, the following section §9.61 treats an associated function, following §9.62 some properties of that function, following §9.621 a related lemma, while §9.63 introduces Riemann&#x27;s main theorem, and so on. Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to Giuseppe Peano on their &quot;Contents&quot; page, although this attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere. Gradshteyn and Ryzhik is another book using this scheme since its third edition in 1951.

== Section breaks ==


Many published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time. This extra space, especially when co-occurring at a page or section break, may contain a special symbol known as a dinkus, a fleuron, or a stylistic dingbat.

==Style advice==

The crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate. The form varies among different types of writing. For example, newspapers, scientific journals, and fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement of paragraph breaks.

A common English usage misconception is that a paragraph has three to five sentences; single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists often use single-sentence paragraphs.

English students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a topic sentence or &quot;main idea&quot;, preferably first, and multiple &quot;supporting&quot; or &quot;detail&quot; sentences that explain or supply evidence. One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, is known as the Schaffer paragraph. Topic sentences are largely a phenomenon of school-based writing, and the convention does not necessarily obtain in other contexts. This advice is also culturally specific, for example, it differs from stock advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese (translated as &quot;danraku&quot; 段落).

<text>William Johnson Jr. (December 27, 1771 – August 4, 1834) was an American attorney, state legislator, and jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1804 until his death in 1834. When he was 32 years old, Johnson was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Thomas Jefferson. He was the first Jeffersonian Republican member of the Court as well as the second Justice from the state of South Carolina. During his tenure, Johnson restored the act of delivering seriatim opinions. He wrote about half of the dissents during the Marshall Court, leading historians to nickname him the &quot;first dissenter&quot;.

Johnson wrote the majority opinion for two major cases (including &quot;United States v. Hudson&quot;) and hundreds of majority opinions in minor admiralty, land, and insurance cases. He supported a strong federal government in economic matters, leading him to join the majority in cases such as &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;, &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;, and &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot; to the dismay of Jefferson and other Republicans.

Johnson&#x27;s strong federalist opinions while sitting as a circuit justice for the District of South Carolina made him a social pariah in his home state. In 1834, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he died later that year from surgery complications. Like most justices on the Marshall Court, Johnson&#x27;s contributions to the law were overshadowed by Chief Justice John Marshall. Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, Johnson&#x27;s jurisprudence became a topic of limited scholarship.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in St. James Goose Creek Parish (now part of Berkeley County, South Carolina) to William Johnson Sr., a blacksmith who moved to South Carolina from New York, and Sarah Johnson, née Nightingale. Both of his parents were supporters of the American Revolution. During the Revolution, Johnson Sr. was considered by British authorities to be &quot;one of the most dangerous and important of the rebels.&quot; He led Charleston revolutionaries alongside Christopher Gadsden and was the originator of Charleston&#x27;s Liberty Tree. Following the siege of Charleston, both Johnson Sr. and Gadsden were imprisoned in St. Augustine, Florida by British commander Sir Henry Clinton. Johnson Jr., alongside his brother and mother (who was also a revolutionary), subsequently fled to New York City, where they lived for the remainder of the Revolution. Following the war, Johnson Sr. was a representative for Charleston in the South Carolina General Assembly.

Johnson was fourteen in the summer of 1787 when delegates met at the Constitutional Convention. According to one Supreme Court historian, &quot;nothing shaped Johnson’s habits of mind more powerfully than the experience of revolution.&quot;

In 1790, William Johnson graduated from Princeton University first in his class. Three years later, he passed the bar after tutelage under Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Johnson was an adherent of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he represented Charleston in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1794 to 1800. In his last term, from 1798 to 1800, he served as Speaker of the House. In 1799, Johnson helped pass a bill to reorganize the state judiciary. Later that year, he was also appointed an associate justice of the state Court of General Sessions and Common Pleas, a position created by Johnson&#x27;s reorganization. The service on that court also included a position on the state Constitutional Court, the highest court in the state at the time.

In 1794, he married Sarah Bennett, the sister of Thomas Bennett Jr., who later served as Governor of South Carolina. Johnson and Bennett were close friends. Johnson and his wife named their son Thomas Bennett in honor of him. The couple had eight children together, six of whom survived. They also adopted two refugees from Santo Domingo.

In 1808, Johnson constructed a 2½-story Charleston single house home on Rutledge Avenue. While on the Supreme Court, Johnson owned slaves.

==Supreme Court career==
On March 22, 1804, President Thomas Jefferson nominated Johnson to be an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, as the successor of Alfred Moore. He was confirmed by the United States Senate by voice vote on March 24, 1804, and was sworn into office on May 7, 1804. Jefferson nominated the 32-year-old Johnson because he was from a similar geographic region as Moore, because Johnson&#x27;s health would allow him to travel regularly (a requirement of the position at the time), and because Johnson adhered to republican principles. He was the first member of the Court who was not a Federalist.

In his years on the Court, Johnson developed a reputation as a frequent and articulate dissenter from the Federalist majority. While Chief Justice John Marshall was frequently able to steer the opinions of most of the justices, Johnson demonstrated an independent streak. Johnson restored the practice of delivering seriatim opinions (a separate opinion from the opinion of the Court) and from 1805 through 1833, he wrote nearly half of the Supreme Court&#x27;s dissenting opinions. For this reason, he has been nicknamed the &quot;first dissenter.&quot;

During his tenure, Johnson wrote the majority opinion for only two major cases: &quot;United States v. Hudson and Goodwin&quot; in 1812&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Mechanics&#x27; Bank of Alexandria v. Bank of Columbia&quot; in 1820. In &quot;U.S. v. Hudson&quot;, the Court held that federal courts lacked the power to develop common law crimes, a decision which was celebrated by Jeffersonians. However, in &quot;Mechanics&#x27; Bank,&quot; the Court established federal common law precedent that a federal judge could hear parol evidence to explain a written contractual agreement if the agreement&#x27;s meaning was ambiguous. Johnson also wrote over a hundred majority opinions for &quot;arcane land, admiralty, and insurance cases&quot; as well as numerous concurrences. Following 1820, Johnson wrote fewer majority opinions and more dissents. The increase in dissents from Johnson may have been due to influence from Jefferson, who praised the practice and urged Johnson to publish more. Ultimately, Johnson wrote about half of the dissents during the Marshall Court.

=== &quot;Gilchrist v. Collector of Charleston&quot; (1808) ===
Following the Chesapeake–Leopard affair in 1807, President Thomas Jefferson signed the Embargo Act, which &quot;expressly granted discretion to the state port collectors to detain any ship that appeared to be violating, or attempting to violate, the embargo.&quot; In 1808, shipowner Adam Gilchrist filed a mandamus action with the circuit court after his ship was detained following the direction of Secretary of Treasury Albert Gallatin. In &quot;Gilchrist v. Collector of Charleston&quot; (1808), Johnson, presiding over the court, ruled that &quot;the collector’s actions would not be justified by Gallatin’s letter because in the embargo act Congress did not sanction the President (or the Department of Treasury) with the discretion to detain ships.&quot;

The case resulted in immediate backlash. While the Federalist press celebrated the decision, it remained unpopular with the majority of citizens. Between July and October 1808, Johnson publicly debated the decision with Attorney General Caesar Augustus Rodney in a series of letters published in Charleston newspapers. Ultimately, the Jefferson administration believed that the circuit court did not have the right to enforce a writ of mandamus. However, the case remains an important yet often forgotten judicial landmark that helped establish judicial independence.

The decision, Johnson&#x27;s first major act of independence, was not appreciated by Jefferson. The two men stopped corresponding for a number of years after &quot;Gilchrist&quot;, and their friendship did not rekindle until Johnson restored their correspondence by offering &quot;rare botanical seeds&quot; to Jefferson. Johnson was nominated for Collector of the Port of Charleston on January 23, 1819, but chose to remain on the Court.

=== Contract Clause jurisprudence ===
In &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot; (1810), Johnson joined the majority of the Court to hold that a Georgia law voiding land grants given by the state the year prior was unconstitutional. It was the first time the Supreme Court ruled a state law as such. Johnson wrote a concurrence in &quot;Fletcher.&quot; He did not disagree with the Court&#x27;s overall holding, but he feared the case may have been &quot;feigned&quot; due to possible collusion between the parties in order to establish precedent. He also disagreed with Marshall&#x27;s reasoning that the Georgia law violated the Contract Clause. He believed that Marshall&#x27;s interpretation of the Contract Clause, that impairments to contract obligations violated it, was overly broad and unnecessarily restrictive of state powers in favor of private rights. Instead, he believed the law violated the general principle of law that one could not revoke ownership in something one no longer owned.

In 1819, Johnson joined the majority in &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward.&quot; In &quot;Dartmouth&quot;, the Court held the Contract Clause applied to private corporations, that a private charter constituted a contract between parties, and that states could not interfere with that contract. Uncharacteristically, Johnson did not write a separate opinion in the case.

However, when the Supreme Court decided the 1823 case of &quot;Green v. Biddle&quot;, Johnson wrote a separate opinion. In &quot;Green&quot;, Johnson wrote an opinion that was part dissent, part concurrence. He concurred with the majority opinion that Kentucky&#x27;s legislative act to restrict the rights of titleholders to their land was illegal but once again, as in &quot;Fletcher&quot; (1810), Johnson believed that the illegality of the act was due to its violation of general principles of law, and not due to it violating the Contract Clause. He forwent analyzing the Contract Clause as he felt it was unnecessary to the legal question in the case. &quot;Green v. Biddle&quot; was one of the Court&#x27;s most important Contract Clause cases of the era, further expanding the clause to include public agreements such as the Virginia-Kentucky compact of 1792.

In 1827, Johnson joined Justice Bushrod Washington&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;Ogden v. Saunders&quot; (1827). The opinion held that the Contract Clause barred only retrospective laws affecting contracts, not prospective laws affecting contracts not yet signed. It was the only constitutional case in which Chief Justice Marshall ever dissented.

=== Federalism jurisprudence ===
In 1813, the Court of Appeals of Virginia, the state&#x27;s highest court at the time, refused to follow the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Fairfax v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee&quot;, a case in which Johnson had dissented, by arguing that the Supreme Court&#x27;s appellate power did not extend to its court. In that case, the Supreme Court, using powers bestowed to it in the Judiciary Act of 1789, held that Virginia had improperly divested a family of title and reversed the state court. In 1816, the Supreme Court answered the defiance of the Court of Appeals of Virginia in &quot;Martin v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee&quot;. In &quot;Martin&quot;, Justice Joseph Story wrote for a unanimous court that &quot;the appellate power of the United States does extend to cases pending in the State courts, and that the 25th section of the judiciary act, which authorizes the exercise of this jurisdiction in the specified cases by a writ of error, is supported by the letter and spirit of the Constitution.&quot;

The opinion written by Story frustrated Johnson&#x27;s wish for a more &quot;forceful assertion of Federal authority.&quot; In a concurring opinion, Johnson wrote that the Supreme Court was &quot;constituted by the voice of the union, and when decisions take place which nothing but a spirit to give ground and harmonize can reconcile, [the Supreme Court&#x27;s voice] is the superior claim upon the comity of the state tribunals.&quot; Johnson further expanded on federalism by stating that:
Johnson also joined two other landmark decisions on federalism. In 1819, he joined a unanimous Court in &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;, a case that struck down an attempt by the Maryland General Assembly to tax the Second Bank of the United States. &quot;McCulloch&quot; established that states could not interfere with the federal government&#x27;s execution of constitutional powers and that the Necessary and Proper Clause gives Congress implied powers that are not enumerated in the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, in 1821, Johnson joined the unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Marshall in &quot;Cohens v. Virginia&quot;, which held that the Supreme Court had the ability to review state criminal proceedings.

=== Denmark Vesey trial and &quot;Elkison v. Deliesseline&quot; (1822) ===
In 1822, Denmark Vesey, a free man of color, and several others were charged with allegedly planning a slave revolt in Charleston. City officials believed Vesey and his followers were planning on overrunning and killing the city&#x27;s white slave owners and then fleeing to Haiti. The alleged Vesey conspiracy was a watershed moment in the lives of many white South Carolinians, but Johnson doubted the alleged threat and magnitude of the plot, which put him at odds with the beliefs of most white citizens, including his own daughter.

Johnson openly questioned the fairness of the resulting trial. He wrote a letter to the &quot;Charleston Courier&quot; in June 1822 and detailed an account of another previously-purported slave rebellion along the border of Georgia and South Carolina. The rebellion that Johnson cited had turned out to be only hearsay and resulted in the murder of an innocent man. Johnson claimed he believed the story &quot;contained an useful moral, and might check the causes of agitation which were then operating upon the public mind&quot; in Charleston.

Johnson was not alone in his criticism. Governor Thomas Bennett criticized the proceedings for being unfair since the trials were held privately, and the accused were not present when witnesses testified. The criticism from both Governor Bennett and Justice Johnson outraged members of the court trying the alleged plotters. In July 1822, the members published a rebuttal in the &quot;Charleston Courier&quot;, and the arrests and executions more than doubled.

After Denmark Vesey&#x27;s arrest and trial, the South Carolina legislature amended the Negro Seaman&#x27;s Act of 1820 to remove the exception for &quot;free negro or mulatto seamen&quot; from being temporarily arrested and imprisoned while their ship ported. Johnson feared that the case would lead to creditor-ship owners leaving free seamen in jail to avoid paying wages, as well as lead to other bans based on racial classification. In the case of &quot;Elkison v. Deliesseline&quot; (1822), Johnson, presiding over his duties on the Circuit Court for the District of South Carolina, found that &quot;the transfer of commerce and treaty powers to the national government eliminated state authority to enact conflicting legislation&quot; and therefore invalidated the statute. It was the first time since 1789 that a federal court invalidated state legislation because of its conflict with the Commerce Clause since it violated a treaty with the United Kingdom. The ruling enraged the white populations of the slave-holding states, and South Carolina nullified the ruling.

=== &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; (1824) ===

In 1824, the Marshall Court unanimously held in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; that the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution gave the federal government the right to regulate instrumentalities of commerce. In the majority opinion, Marshall held that a federal licensing law expressed Congress&#x27;s intent to regulate steamboat commerce and that it invalidated a New York law creating a steamboat monopoly. In contrast, in Johnson&#x27;s concurring opinion, he uncompromisingly argued that it was the federal government&#x27;s exclusive power regardless of federal licensing laws. He further stated that because &quot;[c]ommerce, in its simplest signification, means an exchange of goods&quot;, societal advances would lead to various mediums of exchange (such as labor and intelligence) entering into commerce, and therefore becoming &quot;the objects of [federal] commercial regulation.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s concurrence was unexpectedly nationalist. He had been appointed to be a check on the nationalist Marshall, but instead he &quot;outmarshalled Marshall.&quot; The opinion foreshadowed future constitutional debates regarding the Commerce Clause. In 2018, Justice Anthony Kennedy cited the concurrence in his majority opinion for &quot;South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc.&quot; and wrote that had Johnson&#x27;s view &quot;prevailed and States been denied the power of concurrent regulation, history might have seen sweeping federal regulations at an early date that foreclosed the States from experimentation with laws and policies of their own...&quot;

=== Native American jurisprudence ===
The Georgia Gold Rush in the early 1830s led to two important cases regarding Native American sovereignty that Johnson heard on the bench. In &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; (1831), the Cherokee Nation sought an injunction preventing Georgia from utilizing a series of laws to strip them of their rights and their land, asserting the laws violated treaties that the Nation had signed with the United States. The Court held that it did not have jurisdiction because &quot;an Indian tribe or nation within the United States is not a foreign state in the sense of the constitution, and cannot maintain an action in the courts of the United States&quot;. In Johnson&#x27;s concurrence, he stated that Indian tribes were &quot;nothing more than wandering hordes, held together only by ties of blood and habit, and having neither rules nor government beyond what is required in a savage state.&quot;

The next year, Johnson again joined the majority in &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1832), a landmark decision that held that the &quot;Cherokee nation ... is a distinct community occupying its own territory in which the laws of Georgia can have no force.&quot;

=== Judicial philosophy ===
Johnson was a pioneer of judicial restraint and believed that the legislature and executive branch had a &quot;superior competency and fitness&quot; to deal with evolving problems. His jurisprudence relied on the idea of personal sovereignty enforced by legislation. While he believed an independent judiciary was important, he also believed that the legislature had the right to control the courts in order to protect its own sovereignty. His view of the judicial function differed significantly from the view of Chief Justice Marshall (as well as Justice Washington and Justice Story). Johnson&#x27;s view on expanding federal jurisdiction, as seen in his lone dissent in &quot;Osborn v. Bank of the United States&quot; (1824), also differed from the Chief Justice&#x27;s.

In 1807, Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the majority of the Court, granted two men who were implicated in the Burr conspiracy a writ of habeas corpus in &quot;Ex parte Bollman.&quot; Johnson dissented from the Marshall opinion, stating that the Supreme Court lacked both original and appellate jurisdiction and that the Judiciary Act did not give the Court the ability to issue the writ.

According to one historian, Johnson &quot;valued commonsense argument, factual and doctrinal accuracy, solid annotation, and full disclosure of the circumstances of the case.&quot; Like Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes (who Johnson is theorized to have influenced), Johnson rarely cited cases.

== Career as author ==
In 1822, Johnson authored the two-volume &quot;Sketches of the Life and Correspondence of Nathanael Greene&quot;, a comprehensive work about Major General Nathanael Greene, who played a vital role in the defeat of the British during the American Revolution. The volume was ultimately a financial and critical failure at the time. One contemporary critic ridiculed it by stating that the book had a &quot;poor developed arraignment of topics, an improper use of obscene sentences, and a dismal failure in its use of affected language.&quot; However, the historian Craig Newton in 1964 identified Johnson&#x27;s volumes as a part of the historiography of South Carolina and stated that Johnson &quot;spoke not only for the more competent biographers and historians but also for all others diligent in the preservation of the sources of the Revolution...&quot; Several other historians have theorized that Johnson&#x27;s political attachment to Jefferson was due in part to the power of Jefferson&#x27;s recommendation and introduction to publishers. In the only surviving note in Andrew Jackson&#x27;s correspondence which mentions Justice William Johnson, Jackson suggests Johnson was &quot;interested mainly in literary fame and so could not be trusted to write a friend’s biography.&quot;

== Death and historic appraisal ==
=== Illness and death ===
Johnson became a social pariah in South Carolina following the nullification crisis in 1832 and 1833 because the state &quot;was captured by a party with whose principles he unalterably opposed.&quot; In 1834, he became &quot;fatally ill&quot;, and chose to move his residence to Brooklyn, New York. On August 4, 1834, following particularly painful surgery on his jaw to heal an infection, he died. Johnson had been told the surgery would likely kill him beforehand; however, he opted to proceed with the procedure, which may have been &quot;botched&quot;. It has often been reported that he was buried in the churchyard of St. Philip&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where a large statue of him remains. However, the church does not have record of him ever being interred there.

=== Historic appraisal ===
Like most other Justices on the Marshall Court, Johnson&#x27;s contributions to the Supreme Court were eclipsed by the chief justice. His views on the Constitution are considered &quot;on the losing side&quot; of historic constitutional debate. Historian Sandra Vanburkleo stated that Johnson fell &quot;short of greatness&quot; and that when &quot;reputation depends on permanent contributions to doctrine, too much about Johnson was oppositionist or dyspeptic, and too little survived as precedent.&quot; Historian Fred Rodell, by contrast, named him as &quot;the most underrated of all justices.&quot;

Until the 1950s and 1960s, scholarship on Justice Johnson was almost nonexistent. A biography on Johnson by Donald G. Morgan (the only book-length biography on Johnson thus far) published in 1954 spurred scholarship focusing on Johnson&#x27;s dissents, republicanism, and independence. However, further research on Johnson has been inhibited by limited access to historical documents as families from South Carolina rarely preserved family papers.

<doc id="230757" wikidata="Q152658" url="?curid=230757" title="Sobibor extermination camp">
<text>Sobibor ( ; ) was an extermination camp built and operated by Nazi Germany as part of Operation Reinhard. It was located in the forest near the village of Żłobek Duży in the General Government region of German-occupied Poland.

As an extermination camp rather than a concentration camp, Sobibor existed for the sole purpose of murdering Jews. The vast majority of prisoners were gassed within hours of arrival. Those not killed immediately were forced to assist in the operation of the camp, and few survived more than a few months. In total, some 170,000 to 250,000 people were murdered at Sobibor, making it the fourth-deadliest Nazi camp after Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Belzec.

The camp ceased operation after a prisoner revolt which took place on 14 October 1943. The plan for the revolt involved two phases. In the first phase, teams of prisoners were to discreetly assassinate each of the SS officers. In the second phase, all 600 prisoners would assemble for evening roll call and walk to freedom out the front gate. However, the plan was disrupted after only eleven SS men had been killed. The prisoners had to escape by climbing over barbed wire fences and running through a mine field under heavy machine gun fire. About 300 prisoners made it out of the camp, of whom roughly 60 survived the war.

After the revolt, the Nazis demolished most of the camp in order to hide their crimes from the advancing Red Army. In the first decades after World War II, the site was neglected and the camp had little presence in either popular or scholarly accounts of the Holocaust. It became better known after it was portrayed in the TV miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot; (1978) and the film &quot;Escape from Sobibor&quot; (1987). The Sobibor Museum now stands at the site, which continues to be investigated by archaeologists. Photographs of the camp in operation were published in 2020 as part of the Sobibor perpetrator album.

==Background==

=== Operation Reinhard ===


Sobibor was one of four extermination camps established as part of Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Holocaust. The extermination of Europe&#x27;s Jews did not originate as a single top-down decision, but was rather a patchwork of decisions made regarding particular occupied areas. Following the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Germans began implementing the Nisko Plan in which Jews were deported from ghettos across Europe to the forced labour camps which comprised the &quot;Lublin Reservation&quot;. Lublin District region was chosen in particular for its inhospitable conditions. The Nisko Plan was abandoned in 1940 but many forced labour camps continued operations in the area, including Trawniki, Lipowa 7, and Dorohucza.
In 1941, the Nazis began experimenting with gassing Jews. In December 1941, SS officials at Chełmno conducted experiments using gas vans and the first mass gassings were conducted at Auschwitz concentration camp in January. At the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, Reinhard Heydrich announced a plan for systematically murdering the Jews through a network of extermination camps. This plan was realized as Operation Reinhard.

Nothing is known for certain about the early planning for Sobibor in particular. Some historians have speculated that planning began as early as 1940, on the basis of a railway map from that year which omits several major cities but includes Sobibór and Bełżec. The earliest hard evidence for Nazi interest in the site comes from the testimony of local Poles, who noticed in Autumn 1941 that SS officers were surveying the land opposite the train station. When a worker at the station cafeteria asked one of the SS men what was being built, he replied that she would soon see and that it would be &quot;a good laugh.&quot;

===Camp construction===

In March 1942, &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Richard Thomalla took over construction work at Sobibor, which had begun at an unknown earlier date. Thomalla was a former building contractor and committed Nazi whose service as an auxiliary police commander and adviser on Jewish forced labour had earned him a high-ranking position in Odilo Globočnik&#x27;s construction department. Having previously overseen the construction of Bełżec extermination camp, he applied lessons learned there to Sobibor. Thomalla allotted a much larger area for Sobibor than he had for Bełżec, allowing more room to maneuver as well as providing space for all of the camp&#x27;s facilities to be constructed within its perimeter.

The camp incorporated several pre-war buildings including a post office, a forester&#x27;s lodge, a forestry tower, and a chapel. The forester&#x27;s lodge became the camp administration building, while the post office was used as lodging for the SS (though not, as commonly reported, for the commandant). The former post office, located near the railroad tracks, still stands today. The SS adapted the preexisting railroad infrastructure, adding an 800-meter railroad spur that ended inside the camp. This third set of tracks allowed regular rail traffic to continue uninterrupted while the camp unloaded transports of new prisoners. Some building materials were supplied by the SS Central Construction Office in Lublin, while others were procured from local sawmills and brickworks, as well as from the remains of demolished houses of Jews.

The first group of workers who built the camp were primarily locals from neighbouring villages and towns. It is unknown to what extent these were Polish or Jewish forced labourers. After Thomalla&#x27;s arrival, the Jewish council in nearby Włodawa was ordered to send 150 Jews to assist in the construction of the camp. These workers were constantly harassed as they worked, and were shot if they showed signs of exhaustion. Most were murdered upon completion of construction, but two escaped back to Włodawa, where they attempted to warn the Jewish council about the camp and its purpose. Their warnings were met with disbelief.

The first gas chambers at Sobibor were built following the model of those at Belzec, but without any furnaces. To provide the carbon monoxide gas, &quot;SS-Scharführer&quot; Erich Fuchs acquired a heavy gasoline engine in Lemberg, disassembled from an armoured vehicle or a tractor. Fuchs installed the engine on a cement base at Sobibor in the presence of SS officers Floss, Bauer, Stangl, and Barbl, and connected the engine exhaust manifold to pipes leading to the gas chamber. In mid-April 1942, the Nazis conducted experimental gassings in the nearly finished camp. Christian Wirth, the commander of Bełżec and Inspector of Operation Reinhard, visited Sobibor to witness one of these gassings, which murdered thirty to forty Jewish women brought from the labour camp at Krychów.

The initial construction of Sobibor was finished by summer 1942, and a steady stream of prisoners began thereafter. However, the SS camp was continuously expanded and renovated throughout its existence. After only a few months of operation, the wooden walls of the gas chambers had absorbed too much sweat, urine, blood, and excrement to be cleanable. Thus, the gas chambers were demolished in the summer of 1942, and new larger ones were built made out of brick. Later that summer, the SS also embarked on a beautification project, instituting a more regular cleaning schedule for the barracks and stables, and expanding and landscaping the &quot;Vorlager&quot; to give it the appearance of a &quot;Tyrolean village&quot; much noted by later prisoners. When Sobibor ceased operations in mid-1943, the SS were part way through the construction of a munitions depot known as Lager IV.

===Layout===

Sobibor was surrounded by double barbed wire fences which were thatched with pine branches in order to block the view inside. At its southeast corner, it had two side-by-side gates; one for trains and another for foot traffic and vehicles. The site was divided into five compounds: the &quot;Vorlager&quot; and four &quot;Lagers&quot; numbered &quot;I–IV&quot;.

The &quot;Vorlager&quot; (front compound) contained living quarters and recreational buildings for the camp personnel. The SS officers lived in cottages with colorful names such as &quot;Lustiger Floh&quot; (the Merry Flea), &quot;Schwalbennest&quot; (the Swallow&#x27;s Nest), and &quot;Gottes Heimat&quot; (God&#x27;s Own Home). They also had a canteen, a bowling alley, a hairdresser, and a dentist, all staffed by Jewish prisoners. The watchmen, drawn from Soviet POWs, had separate barracks, and their own separate recreational buildings, including a hair salon and a canteen.

The Nazis paid great attention to the appearance of the &quot;Vorlager&quot;. It was neatly landscaped, with lawns and gardens, outdoor terraces, gravel-lined paths, and professionally painted signs. This idyllic appearance helped hide the nature of the camp from prisoners, who would arrive on the adjacent ramp. Survivor Jules Schelvis recalled feeling reassured upon arrival by the &quot;Vorlager&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Tyrolean cottage-like barracks with their bright little curtains and geraniums on the windowsills&quot;.

&quot;Lager I&quot; contained barracks and workshops for the prisoners. These workshops included a tailor&#x27;s shop, a carpenter&#x27;s shop, a mechanic&#x27;s shop, a sign-painter&#x27;s shop, and a bakery. &quot;Lager I&quot; was accessible only through the adjacent &quot;Vorlager&quot;, and its western boundary was made escape-proof with a water-filled trench.

&quot;Lager II&quot; was a larger multi-purpose compound. One subsection called the &quot;&quot;Erbhof&quot;&quot; contained the administration building, as well as a small farm. The administration building was a pre-war structure previously used by the local Polish forestry service. As part of the camp, this building was adapted to provide accommodation for some SS officers, storage for goods stolen from victims&#x27; luggage, as well as a pharmacy, whose contents were also taken from victims&#x27; luggage. On the farm, Jewish prisoners raised chickens, pigs, geese, fruits and vegetables for consumption by the SS men.

Outside the &quot;Erbhof&quot;, &quot;Lager II&quot; contained facilities where new arrivals were prepared before being murdered. It contained the sorting barracks and other buildings used for storing items taken from the victims, including clothes, food, hair, gold, and other valuables. At the east end was a yard where new arrivals had their luggage taken from them and were forced to undress. This area was beautified with flower beds to hide the camp&#x27;s purpose from newcomers. This yard led into the narrow enclosed path called the &quot;Himmelstrasse&quot; (road to heaven) or the &quot;Schlauch&quot; (tube), which led straight to the gas chambers in &quot;Lager III&quot;. The &quot;Himmelstrasse&quot; was covered on both sides by fences woven with pine branches.

&quot;Lager III&quot; was the extermination area. It was isolated from the rest of the camp, set back in a clearing in the forest and surrounded by its own thatched fence. Prisoners from &quot;Lager I&quot; were not allowed near it, and were killed if they were suspected of having seen inside. Due to a lack of eyewitness testimony, little is known about &quot;Lager III&quot; beyond the fact that it contained gas chambers, mass graves, and special separate housing for the Sonderkommando prisoners who worked there.

&quot;Lager IV&quot; (also called the &quot;Nordlager&quot;) was added in July 1943, and was still under construction at the time of the revolt. Located in a heavily wooded area to the north of the other camps, it was being developed as a munitions depot for processing arms taken from Red Army soldiers.

==Life in the camp==

===Prisoner life===

Because Sobibor was an extermination camp, the only prisoners who lived there were the roughly 600 slave labourers forced to assist in the operation of the camp. While survivors of Auschwitz use the term &quot;selected&quot; to mean being selected for murder, at Sobibor being &quot;selected&quot; meant being selected to live, at least temporarily. The harsh conditions in the camp took the lives of most new arrivals within a few months.

====Work====

Prisoners worked from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, with a short lunch break in the middle. Sundays were designated as half days, but this policy was not always observed. The prisoner population included many labourers with specialized skills such as goldsmithing, painting, gardening, or tailoring. While such prisoners were officially spared death only to support the camp&#x27;s primary operations, much of their labour was in fact diverted for the SS officers&#x27; personal enrichment. Renowned Dutch Jewish painter Max van Dam was nominally kept as a sign painter, but the SS also forced him to paint landscapes, portraits, and hagiographic images of Hitler. Similarly, Shlomo Szmajzner was placed in charge of the machine shop in order to conceal his work making gold jewelry for SS officers. Prisoners with specialized skills were considered especially valuable and were afforded privileges not available to others.

Those without specialized skills performed a variety of other jobs. Many worked in the &quot;Lager II&quot; sorting barracks, where they were forced to comb through luggage left behind by gas chamber victims, repackaging valuable items as &quot;charity gifts&quot; for German civilians. These workers could also be called on to serve in the railway brigade which greeted new prisoners. The railway brigade was considered a relatively appealing job, since it gave famished workers access to luggage which often contained food. Younger prisoners commonly worked as &quot;putzers&quot;, cleaning for the Nazis and the watchmen and attending to their needs. A particularly horrifying job was that of the &quot;barbers&quot; who cut the hair of women on their way to the gas chamber. This job was often forced upon young male prisoners in an attempt to humiliate both them and the naked women whose hair they were cutting. Armed watchmen supervised the process in order to ensure that barbers did not respond to victims&#x27; questions or pleas.

In &quot;Lager III&quot;, a special unit of Jewish prisoners was forced to assist in the extermination process. Its tasks included removing bodies, searching cavities for valuables, scrubbing blood and excrement from the gas chambers, and cremating the corpses. Because the prisoners who belonged to this unit were direct witnesses to genocide, they were strictly isolated from other prisoners and the SS would periodically liquidate those unit members who had not already succumbed to the work&#x27;s physical and psychological toll. Since no workers from &quot;Lager III&quot; survived, nothing is known about their lives or experiences.

When construction of &quot;Lager IV&quot; began in the summer of 1943, the Nazis assembled a forest commando who worked there cutting timber for heat, cooking, as well as cremation pyres.

Prisoners struggled with the fact that their labour made them complicit in mass murder, albeit indirectly and unwillingly. Many committed suicide. Others endured, finding ways to resist, if only symbolically. Common symbolic forms of resistance included praying for the dead, observing Jewish religious rites, and singing songs of resistance. However, some prisoners found small ways of materially fighting back. While working in the sorting shed, Saartje Wijnberg would surreptitiously damage fine items of clothing to prevent them from being sent to Germany. After the war, Esther Terner recounted what she and Zelda Metz did when they found an unattended pot of soup in the Nazis&#x27; canteen: &quot;We spit in it and washed our hands in it... Don&#x27;t ask me what else we did to that soup... And they ate it.&quot;

====Social relations====

Prisoners found it difficult to forge personal relationships. This was in part due to the constant turnover in the camp population, but also to an atmosphere of mutual distrust which was often exacerbated by national or linguistic divisions. Dutch Jews were particularly subject to derision and suspicion because of their assimilated manners and limited Yiddish. German Jews faced the same suspicion as the Dutch, with the added implication that they might identify more with their captors than with their fellow prisoners. When social groups did form, they were generally based on family ties or shared nationality, and were completely closed off to outsiders. Chaim Engel even found himself shunned by fellow Polish Jews after he began a romantic relationship with Dutch-born Saartje Wijnberg. These divisions had dire consequences for many prisoners from Western Europe, who were not trusted with crucial information about goings-on in the camp.

Because of the expectation of imminent death, prisoners adopted a day-at-a-time outlook. Crying was rare and evenings were often spent enjoying whatever of life was left. As revolt organizer Leon Feldhendler recounted after the war, &quot;The Jews only had one goal: &quot;carpe diem&quot;, and in this they simply went wild.&quot; Prisoners sang and danced in the evenings and sexual or romantic relations were frequent. Some of these affairs were likely transactional or coerced, especially those between female prisoners and &quot;kapos&quot;, but others were driven by genuine bonds. Two couples that met in Sobibor were married after the war. The Nazis allowed and even encouraged an atmosphere of merriment, going so far as to recruit prisoners for a choir at gunpoint. Many prisoners interpreted these efforts as attempts by the Nazis to keep the prisoners docile and to prevent them from thinking about escape.

Prisoners had a pecking order largely determined by one&#x27;s usefulness to the Germans. As survivor Toivi Blatt observed, there were three categories of prisoners: the expendable &quot;drones&quot; whose lives were entirely at the mercy of the SS, the privileged workers whose special jobs provided some relative comforts, and finally the artisans whose specialized knowledge made them indispensable and earned them preferential treatment. Moreover, as at other camps, the Nazis appointed &quot;kapos&quot; to keep their fellow prisoners in line. &quot;Kapos&quot; carried out a variety of supervisory duties and enforced their commands with whips. &quot;Kapos&quot; were involuntary appointees, and they varied widely in how they responded to the psychological pressures of their position. &quot;Oberkapo&quot; Moses Sturm was nicknamed &quot;Mad Moisz&quot; for his mercurial temperament. He would beat prisoners horrifically without provocation and then later apologize hysterically. He talked constantly of escape, sometimes merely berating the other prisoners for their passivity, other times attempting to formulate actionable plans. Sturm was executed after being betrayed by a lower ranking &quot;kapo&quot; named Herbert Naftaniel. Naftaniel, nicknamed &quot;Berliner&quot;, was promoted to &quot;Oberkapo&quot; and became a notorious figure in the camp. He viewed himself as German rather than Jewish, and began a reign of terror which came to an end shortly before the revolt, when a group of prisoners beat him to death with &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Karl Frenzel&#x27;s permission.

Despite these divisions in the camp, prisoners found ways to support each other. Sick and injured prisoners were given clandestine food as well as medicine and sanitary supplies stolen from the camp pharmacy. Healthy prisoners were expected to cover for sick prisoners who would otherwise be killed. The camp nurse Kurt Ticho developed a method of falsifying his records so that sick prisoners could take more than the allotted three day recovery period. Members of the railway brigade attempted to warn new arrivals of their impending murder but were met with incredulity. The most successful act of solidarity in the camp was the revolt on 14 October 1943, which was expressly planned so that all of the prisoners in the camp would have at least some chance of escape.

====Health and living conditions====

Prisoners suffered from sleep deprivation, malnourishment, and the physical and emotional toll of grueling labour and constant beatings. Lice, skin infections, and respiratory infections were common, and typhoid swept the camp on occasion. When Sobibor first opened, prisoners were regarded as expendable and shot at the first sign of illness or injury. After a few months, the SS grew concerned that the enormous death rate was limiting the camp&#x27;s efficiency. In order to increase the continuity of its labour force and alleviate the need to constantly train new workers, the SS instituted a new policy allowing incapacitated prisoners three days to recover. Those still unable to work after three days were shot.

Food in the camp was extremely limited. As at other Lublin district camps, prisoners were given about 200 grams of bread for breakfast along with Ersatz coffee. Lunch was typically a thin soup sometimes with some potatoes or horse meat. Dinner could be once again simply coffee. Prisoners forced to live on these rations found their personalities changing due to hunger. Others supplemented these rations surreptitiously, for instance by helping themselves to food from victims&#x27; luggage while working in the sorting barracks or in the railway brigade. A barter system developed in the camp, which included not only prisoners but also the watchmen, who would serve as intermediaries between the Jews and local peasants, exchanging jewels and cash from the sorting barracks for food and liquor in exchange for a large cut.

Most prisoners had little or no access to hygiene and sanitation. There were no showers in &quot;Lager I&quot; and clean water was scarce. Although clothing could be washed or replaced from the sorting barracks, the camp was so thoroughly infested that there was little point. However, some prisoners worked in areas of the camp such as the laundry which gave them occasional access to better hygiene.

===Camp personnel===

The personnel at Sobibor included a small cadre of German and Austrian SS officers, and a much larger group of &quot;watchmen&quot;, generally of Soviet origin.

====SS garrison====

Sobibor was staffed by a rotating group of eighteen to twenty-two German and Austrian SS officers. The SS officers were generally from lower-middle-class backgrounds, having previously worked as merchants, artisans, farmhands, nurses, and policemen. Almost all the Sobibor SS officers had previously served in Aktion T4, the Nazi forced euthanasia program. In particular, a large contingent had previously served together at Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many practices developed at Hartheim were continued at Sobibor, including methods for deceiving victims on the way to the gas chambers. Before beginning work at Sobibor, they had met with Odilo Globočnik in Lublin and signed a confidentiality agreement. Over the course of its operation, roughly 100 SS officers served at Sobibor.

When Sobibor first opened, its commandant was &quot;SS-Obersturmführer&quot; Franz Stangl, a meticulous organizer who worked to increase the efficiency of the extermination process. Stangl had little interaction with the prisoners, with the exception of Shlomo Szmajzner who recalled Stangl as a vain man who stood out for &quot;his obvious pleasure in his work and his situation. None of the others—although they were, in different ways, so much worse than he—showed this to such an extent. He had this perpetual smile on his face.&quot; Stangl was transferred to Treblinka in August 1942, and his job at Sobibor was filled by &quot;SS-Obersturmführer&quot; Franz Reichleitner. Reichleitner was an alcoholic and a determined anti-semite who took little interest in what went on in the camp aside from the extermination process. SS-&quot;Untersturmführer&quot; Johann Niemann served as the camp&#x27;s deputy commandant.

Day-to-day operations were generally handled by &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Gustav Wagner, the most feared and hated man in Sobibor. Prisoners regarded him as brutal, demanding, unpredictable, observant, and sadistic. They referred to him as &quot;The Beast&quot; and &quot;Wolf&quot;. Reporting to Wagner was &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Karl Frenzel, who oversaw &quot;Lager I&quot; and acted as the camp&#x27;s &quot;judicial authority&quot;. Kurt Bolender and oversaw &quot;Lager III&quot;, the extermination area, while &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Erich Bauer and &quot;SS-Scharführer&quot; Josef Vallaster typically directed the gassing procedure itself.

The SS men considered their job appealing. At Sobibor, they could enjoy creature comforts not available to soldiers fighting on the Eastern Front. The officer&#x27;s compound in the camp had a canteen, a bowling alley, and a barber shop. The &quot;officers&#x27; country club&quot; was a short distance away, on nearby Perepsza Lake. Each SS man was allowed three weeks of leave every three months, which they could spend at &quot;Haus Schoberstein&quot;, an SS-owned resort in the Austrian town of Weissenbach on Lake Attersee. Moreover, the job could be lucrative: each officer received base pay of 58 ℛℳ per month, plus a daily allowance of 18 ℛℳ, and special bonuses including a &quot;Judenmordzulage&quot; (Jew murder supplement). In all, an officer at Sobibor could earn 600 ℛℳ per month in pay. In addition to the official compensation, a job at Sobibor offered endless opportunities for the SS officers to covertly enrich themselves by exploiting the labour and stealing the possessions of their victims. In one case, the SS officers enslaved a 15-year-old goldsmith prodigy named Shlomo Szmajzner, who made them rings and monograms from gold extracted from the teeth of gas chamber victims.

During post-war trials, SS officers from all of the Operation Reinhard camps claimed that they would have been executed if they had not participated in the murders. However, the judges in the Treblinka trial could not find any evidence of SS officers being executed for desertion, and at least one Sobibor officer (Alfred Ittner) successfully got himself transferred.

====Watchmen====

Sobibor was guarded by approximately 400 watchmen. Survivors often refer to them as &quot;blackies&quot;, &quot;Askaris&quot;, or &quot;Ukrainians&quot; (even though many were not Ukrainian). They were captured Soviet prisoners of war who had volunteered for the SS in order to escape the abominable conditions in Nazi POW camps. Watchmen were nominally guards, but they were also expected to supervise work details and perform manual labour including punishments and executions. They also took an active part in the extermination process, unloading transports and escorting the victims into the gas chambers. Watchmen dressed in mixed-and-matched pieces of Nazi, Soviet, and Polish uniforms, often dyed black (giving rise to the term &quot;blackies&quot;). They received pay and rations similar to those of Waffen-SS, as well as a family allowance and holiday leave.

Although the watchmen inspired terror among the prisoners, their loyalty to the SS was not unwavering. They played an active role in Sobibor&#x27;s underground barter economy, and drank copiously despite being prohibited from doing so. The SS officers were wary of the watchmen, and limited their access to ammunition. Watchmen were also transferred frequently between different camps in order to prevent them from building up local contacts or knowledge of the surrounding area. After the prisoner uprising, the SS feared that the watchmen would themselves revolt, and sent them all back to Trawniki under armed guard. Their fears proved correct, as the watchmen killed their SS escort and fled.

===Interactions between prisoners and perpetrators===

Prisoners lived in constant fear of their captors. They were punished for transgressions as inconsequential as smoking a cigarette, resting while working, and showing insufficient enthusiasm when forced to sing. Punishment was used not only to enforce the official camp rules, but also the guards&#x27; personal whims. The most common punishment was flogging. SS officers carried 80 centimeter whips which had been specially made by slave labour prisoners using leather taken from the luggage of gas chamber victims. Even when flogging was not in itself lethal, it would prove a death sentence if it left the recipient too injured to work. Many survivors remember an unusually large and aggressive St. Bernard named Barry that Kurt Bolender and Paul Groth would sic on prisoners. In the summer of 1943, &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Gustav Wagner and &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Hubert Gomerski formed a penal brigade, consisting of prisoners who were forced to work while running. Prisoners were assigned to the penal brigade for a period of three days, but most died before their time was up.

The SS exercised absolute authority over the prisoners and treated them as a source of entertainment. They forced prisoners to sing while working, while marching, and even during public executions. Some survivor testimonies recount prisoners performing mock cockfights for the SS, with their arms tied behind their backs. Others recount being forced to sing demeaning songs such as &quot;I am a Jew with a big nose&quot;. Female prisoners were sexually abused on several occasions. For instance, at a postwar trial, Erich Bauer testified that two Austrian Jewish actresses, named Ruth and Gisela, were confined in an SS barracks and gang raped by &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Kurt Bolender and &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Gustav Wagner, among others.

Unique among the SS officers, &quot;Unterscharführer&quot; Johann Klier was known to be relatively humane, and several survivors testified on his behalf at his trial. In an interview with Richard Rashke, Esther Terner commented &quot;I don&#x27;t even know why he was in Sobibor ... even the other Nazis picked on him.&quot;

Prisoners regarded the watchmen as the most dangerous among the Sobibor staff, their cruelty surpassing that of the SS officers. In the words of historian Marek Bem, &quot;It can be said that the Ukrainian guards&#x27; cynicism was in no way inferior to the SS men&#x27;s premeditation.&quot; However, some individual watchmen were sympathetic to the Jews, doing the minimum possible while on duty and even assisting with prisoners&#x27; escape attempts. In one documented instance, two watchmen named Victor Kisiljow and Wasyl Zischer escaped with six Jewish prisoners, but were betrayed and killed.

Prisoners developed complex relationships with their tormenters. In order to avoid the most extreme cruelties, many tried to ingratiate themselves with the SS officers, for instance by choosing maudlin German folk songs when ordered to sing. In other cases, prisoners found themselves unwillingly favored. &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Karl Frenzel took a liking to Saartje Wijnberg, constantly smiling at her and teasingly referring to her and Chaim Engel as &quot;bride and groom&quot;. He was protective towards her, excusing her from torturous work inflicted on other Dutch prisoners and sparing her when he liquidated the sick barracks on 11 October 1943. She struggled with this attention and felt angry at herself when she noticed herself feeling grateful to him. At his trial, Frenzel declared &quot;I actually do believe the Jews even liked me!&quot; though both prisoners and other SS officers regarded him as exceptionally cruel and brutal. Similarly, camp commandant &quot;SS-Obersturmführer&quot; Franz Stangl &quot;made a pet&quot; of the 14 year old goldsmith Shlomo Szmajzner and regarded his post-war trial testimony as a personal betrayal. Stangl particularly objected to the implication that his habit of bringing Smajzner sausages on the sabbath had been a deliberate attempt to torment the starving teenager. Szmajzner himself was not sure of Stangl&#x27;s intentions: &quot;it&#x27;s perfectly true that he seemed to like me... still, it was funny, wasn&#x27;t it, that he always brought it on a Friday evening?&quot;

==Extermination==

===Killing process===

On either 16 or 18 May 1942, Sobibor became fully operational and began mass gassings. Trains entered the railway siding with the unloading platform, and the Jews on board were told they were in a transit camp. They were forced to hand over their valuables, were separated by sex and told to undress. The nude women and girls, recoiling in shame, were met by the Jewish workers who cut off their hair in a mere half a minute. Among the &quot;Friseur&quot; (barbers) was Toivi Blatt (age 15). The condemned prisoners, formed into groups, were led along the long &quot;Road to Heaven&quot; (&quot;Himmelstrasse&quot;) to the gas chambers, where they were murdered using carbon monoxide released from the exhaust pipes of a tank engine. During his trial, &quot;SS-Oberscharführer&quot; Kurt Bolender described the killing operations as follows:

Local Jews were delivered in absolute terror, many amongst them screaming and pounding. Foreign Jews, on the other hand were treated with deceitful politeness. Passengers from Westerbork, Netherlands, had a comfortable journey. There were Jewish doctors and nurses attending them and no shortage of food or medical supplies on the train. To them, Sobibor did not seem like a genuine threat.

The non-Polish victims included 18-year-old Helga Deen from the Netherlands, whose diary was discovered in 2004; the writer Else Feldmann from Austria; Dutch Olympic gold medalist gymnasts Helena Nordheim, Ans Polak, and Jud Simons; gym coach Gerrit Kleerekoper; and magician Michel Velleman.

After the killing in the gas chambers, the corpses were collected by &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; and taken to mass graves or cremated in the open air. The burial pits were long, wide, and deep, with sloping sandy walls in order to facilitate the burying of corpses.

===Death toll===
Between 170,000 and 250,000 Jews were murdered at Sobibor. The precise death toll is unknown, since no complete record survives. The most commonly cited figure of 250,000 was first proposed in 1947 by a Polish judge named Zbigniew Łukaszewicz, who interviewed survivors, railwaymen, and external witnesses to estimate of the frequency and capacity of the transports. Later research has reached the same figure drawing on more specific documentation, although other recent studies have given lower estimates such as Jules Schelvis&#x27;s figure of 170,165. According to historian Marek Bem, &quot;The range of scientific research into this question shows how rudimentary our current knowledge is of the number of victims of this extermination camp.&quot;

One major source which can be used to estimate the death toll is the Höfle Telegram, a collection of SS cables which give precise numbers of &quot;recorded arrivals&quot; at each of the Operation Reinhard camps prior to 31 December 1942. Identical numbers are found in the Korherr Report, another surviving Nazi document. These sources both report 101,370 arrivals at Sobibor during the year 1942, but the meaning of this figure is open to interpretation. Some scholars, such as Bem, suggest that it refers only to Jews arriving from within the General Government. However, others such as Jules Schelvis take it as a record of the total arrivals during that year and thus combine it with an estimate of the killings in 1943 to reach a total estimate.

Other key sources of information include records of particular transports sent to Sobibor. In some cases, this information is detailed and systematic. For instance, the Dutch Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies archive contains precise records of each transport sent to Sobibor from the Netherlands, totaling 34,313 individuals. In other cases, transports are only known through incidental evidence, such as when one of its passengers was among the survivors.
Many of the difficulties in reaching a firm death toll arise from the incompleteness of surviving evidence. Records of deportations are more likely to exist when they took place by train, meaning that estimates likely undercount the number of prisoners brought on trucks, horse-drawn carts, or by foot. Moreover, even records of trains appear to contain gaps. For example, while a letter from Albert Ganzenmüller to Karl Wolff mentions past trains from Warsaw to Sobibor, no itineraries survive. On the other hand, estimates may count small numbers of individuals as Sobibor victims who in fact died elsewhere, or conceivably even survived. This is because small groups of new arrivals were occasionally selected to work in one of the nearby labour camps, rather than being gassed immediately as was the norm. For instance, when Jules Schelvis was deported to Sobibor on a transport carrying 3,005 Dutch Jews, he was one of 81 men selected to work in Dorohucza, and the only one to survive. Although these instances were rare and some are documented well enough to be accounted for, they could still have a small cumulative effect on estimates of the death toll.

Other figures have been given which differ from what is indicated by reliable historical evidence. Numbers as high as 3 million appear in reports requested immediately after the war by the Central Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland. During the Sobibor trials in the 1960s, the judges adopted a figure of 152,000 victims, though they stressed that this was not a complete estimate but rather a minimum limited by the procedural rules concerning evidence. Survivors have suggested numbers of victims significantly higher than what historians accept. Many recall a camp rumour that Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s visit in February 1943 was intended to celebrate the millionth victim, and others suggest figures even higher. Bem suggests that survivors&#x27; estimates disagree with the record because they reflect &quot;the state of their emotions back then, as well as the drama and the scale of tragedy which happened in Sobibor&quot;. Another high figure comes from one of the perpetrators, &quot;SS-Oberscharfuhrer&quot; Erich Bauer, who recalled his colleagues expressing regret that Sobibor &quot;came last&quot; in the competition among the Operation Reinhard camps, having claimed only 350,000 lives.

==Uprising==

On the afternoon of 14 October 1943, members of the Sobibor underground covertly killed eleven of the on-duty SS men and then led roughly 300 prisoners to freedom. This revolt was one of three uprisings by Jewish prisoners in extermination camps, the others being those at Treblinka extermination camp on 2 August 1943 and at Auschwitz-Birkenau on 7 October 1944.

===Lead up===

In the summer of 1943, rumors began to circulate that Sobibor would soon cease operations. The prisoners understood that this would mean certain death for them all, since the final cohort of Bełżec prisoners had been murdered at Sobibor after dismantling their own camp. The Sobibor prisoners knew this since the Bełżec prisoners had sewn messages into their clothing:

We worked at Bełżec for one year and did not know where we would be sent next. They said it would be Germany... Now we are in Sobibór and know what to expect. Be aware that you will be killed also! Avenge us!

An escape committee formed in response to these rumors. Their leader was Leon Feldhendler, a former member of the Judenrat in Żółkiewka. His job in the sorting barracks gave him access to additional food, sparing him from the hunger which robbed other workers of their mental acuity. However, the escape committee made minimal progress that summer. In light of previous betrayals and the ever-looming threat of collective punishment, they needed to keep their discussions limited to roughly seven Polish Jews, but this insularity severely limited their capacity to form a plan, since none of their members had the military or strategic experience necessary to carry out a mass escape. By late September, their discussions had stalled.

On 22 September, the situation changed dramatically when roughly twenty Jewish Red Army POWs arrived at Sobibor on a transport from the Minsk Ghetto and were selected for labour. Among them was Alexander Pechersky, an actor, songwriter, and political commissar who would go on to lead the revolt. The members of the escape committee approached the newly-arrived Russians with excitement, but also caution. On one hand, the Russians were soldiers and thus had the expertise to pull off an escape. But on the other hand, it was not clear whether there was sufficient mutual trust.

Feldhendler introduced himself to Pechersky using the alias &quot;Baruch&quot; and kept an eye on him for his first several days in the camp. In those days, Pechersky distinguished himself by not only standing up to the SS officers, but by showing discretion in how he did so. Feldhendler invited Pechersky to share news from outside the camp at a meeting in the women&#x27;s barracks. Feldhendler was initially shocked to discover Pechersky&#x27;s limited ability to speak Yiddish, the common language of Eastern European Jews. However, the two were able to communicate in Russian, and Pechersky agreed to attend. At the meeting, Pechersky gave a speech and took questions while his friend Solomon Leitman translated into Yiddish. (Leitman was a Polish Jew who had befriended Pechersky in the Minsk Ghetto.) Feldhendler and the other members of the escape committee were concerned about Pechersky&#x27;s blatant communist propaganda, but were nonetheless impressed by him. They were particularly struck by Pechersky&#x27;s response to a question about whether Soviet partisans would liberate the camp: &quot;No one can do our work for us.&quot;

Over the next few weeks, Pechersky met regularly with the escape committee. These meetings were held in the women&#x27;s barracks under the pretext of him having an affair with a woman known as &quot;Luka&quot;. Pechersky and Feldhendler agreed that the revolt would allow all 600 prisoners at least some chance of escape, though they later concluded that they would not be able to include the over fifty &quot;sonderkommando&quot; workers who were kept under strict isolation in &quot;Lager III&quot;. At first, Pechersky and Leitman discussed a plan to dig a tunnel from the carpenter&#x27;s workshop in &quot;Lager I&quot;, which was close to the south fence. This idea was abandoned as too difficult. If the tunnel was too deep, it would hit the high water table and flood. Too shallow, and it would detonate one of the mines surrounding the camp. Furthermore, the organizers doubted that they could get all 600 prisoners through the tunnel without getting caught.

The ultimate idea for the revolt came to Pechersky while he was assigned to the forest brigade, chopping wood near &quot;Lager III&quot;. While working, he heard a child in the gas chamber screaming &quot;Mama! Mama!&quot;. Overcome with his feeling of powerlessness and reminded of his own daughter Elsa, he decided that the plan could not be a mere escape. Rather, it would have to be a revolt. Over the next week, Pechersky and Leitman developed what became the ultimate plan.

=== Revolt ===

The revolt began late in the afternoon on 14 October 1943. The plan consisted of two phases. In the first phase, the prisoners would lure the SS officers to secluded locations around the camp and kill them. These covert killings would take place in the hour before evening roll call. The second phase would begin at evening roll call, after all the prisoners had assembled in the &quot;Lager I&quot; roll call yard. The &quot;kapos&quot; would announce that the SS had ordered a special work detail in the forest outside the camp, and the entire group would calmly march to freedom out the front gate. If the watchmen found this unusual, they would not be able to confirm their suspicions or coordinate a response since the SS men would be dead.

==== Covert killings ====

At 4:00 pm, Deputy Commandant SS-Untersturmführer Johann Niemann rode up to the &quot;Lager I&quot; tailor&#x27;s barracks on his horse. Earlier in the day, the head tailor had scheduled an appointment with him to be fitted for a leather jacket taken from a murdered Jew. The conspirators had prioritized Niemann&#x27;s execution, since he was acting commandant while Commandant Reichleitner was on leave. Even if the rest of the plan failed, they anticipated that Niemann&#x27;s death alone would cause enough chaos to allow some chance of escape. While admiring the jacket, Niemann spotted one of the Russian prisoners standing by with an axe. Niemann asked what he was doing there, but was satisfied with the head tailor&#x27;s explanation that he was simply there to repair a table. At the tailor&#x27;s request, Niemann removed his pistol holster and put on the jacket. The tailor asked Niemann to turn around, ostensibly to check if any alterations were needed in the back. When Niemann complied, two prisoners crept up behind him with axes and split his head open. Niemann&#x27;s body was shoved under a table and his blood was covered up with sawdust.

Over the next hour, one SS officer was killed roughly every six minutes. Other than Niemann, those killed in &quot;Lager I&quot; included SS-Unterscharführer Josef Vallaster, SS-Oberscharführer Siegfried Graetschus, Sturmführer Ivan Klatt, SS-Unterscharführer Friedrich Gaulstich, and SS-Unterscharführer Fritz Konrad. Those killed in &quot;Lager II&quot; included SS-Scharführer Josef Wolf and SS-Oberscharführer Rudolf Beckmann. Unterscharführer Walter Ryba was killed in the &quot;Vorlager&quot;. Other officers killed include Max Bree, Anton Nowak, Thomas Steffl, Ernst Stengelin. The details of many of these killings are unknown.

The conspirators had originally planned to kill SS-Oberscharführer Rudolf Beckmann in a &quot;Lager II&quot; storage barracks, but on his way to the appointment, Beckmann had suddenly turned around and headed back to the administration building. Chaim Engel volunteered to kill Beckmann in his office, after overhearing Feldhendler discussing the situation with &quot;Kapo&quot; Hersh Pozyczki, the younger brother of &quot;Oberkapo&quot; Pozyczki. Engel and the younger Pozyczki went together to the administration building, and Engel stabbed Beckmann while Pozyczki restrained him. When Engel stabbed Beckmann, he shouted &quot;For my father! For my brother! For all the Jews!&quot; Beckmann struggled as Engel stabbed him, causing Engel&#x27;s knife to slip and cut his own hand. Once Beckmann was dead, the two prisoners pushed his body under the desk, not having time to better hide him or clean up.

While the killings proceeded, Szlomo Szmajzner went to the &quot;Vorlager&quot; to acquire additional guns from the watchmens&#x27; barracks. During the last organizational meeting, on 12 October, he had offered to do so himself. As the camp machinist, Smajzner was often called to the &quot;Vorlager&quot; to clean and repair the stoves there, so he was able to enter the barracks carrying a replacement stovepipe over his shoulder. He entered the watchmens&#x27; barracks and helped himself to six rifles and ammunition. However, he could only fit two of the rifles inside the stovepipe, so he wrapped the others in a blanket. Once he was ready to go, he decided that it might be safer to hunker down in the &quot;Vorlager&quot; and not return to &quot;Lager I&quot; until the bugle call. That way, it would seem like he had been acting alone if he was caught. Just before the bugle at 5:00 pm, he found two child prisoners and ordered them to carry the blanket with the rifles. They were scared, so he forced them to do it at knifepoint. After the bugle call, he delivered the rifles to the Russians, but demanded that they let him keep one for himself.

==== Breakout ====

As roll call drew closer, Pechersky became increasingly concerned that the revolt would soon be discovered. He was surprised that the plan had succeeded so far, but nonetheless several killings had not gone as intended. In particular, while his plan had required that the SS men be killed discreetly, an impulsive prisoner had killed Unterscharführer Walter Ryba in the outdoor &quot;Vorlager&quot; garage. Pechersky considered beginning the breakout early, but was reluctant to do so while SS-Oberscharführer Karl Frenzel was still alive. Frenzel, regarded as one of the most dangerous officers in the camp, had dallied in the shower and was late for his appointment in the carpenter&#x27;s shop. Close to 5:00 pm, Pechersky and Leitman finally decided to give up on Frenzel and sent the bugler Judah to climb the forester&#x27;s tower and blow the bugle announcing the end of the workday.

At this point, many prisoners in &quot;Lager I&quot; had already left their jobs and were standing around in the roll call yard or hiding in the adjacent buildings. In &quot;Lager II&quot;, the prisoners were confused by the early bugle call and gathered haphazardly for the march back to &quot;Lager I&quot;. Feldhendler was concerned that their unusual and disorderly lineup would attract attention from the guards, so he decided to lead the march on his own. He lined them up and they marched, singing the German sentimental tune &quot;Es war ein Edelweiss&quot;. As the prisoners gathered in the roll call yard, rumours about the revolt began to spread among them. When a watchman prodded them to line up faster, a group of prisoners shouted &quot;don&#x27;t you know the war is over&quot; and killed him out in the open, to the shock of many others. Realizing that the yard had become a powder keg, Pechersky attempted to inform the group of what was going on. Blatt recalled Pechersky&#x27;s speech as follows:

As the prisoners began to disperse, they heard shots from &quot;Lager II&quot;. These shots were fired by SS-Oberscharführer Erich Bauer, who had returned from Chełm with a truck full of vodka. Just before the bugle sounded, Bauer had ordered two child prisoners to unload the vodka and carry it into the storeroom in the administration building where Beckmann had been killed. At approximately the moment when Pechersky was making his speech in &quot;Lager I&quot;, a watchman ran over to Bauer shouting &quot;Ein deutsch kaput!&quot; Thinking that the children were responsible, Bauer fired his pistol, killing one of the children but missing the other. When the prisoners in &quot;Lager I&quot; heard these shots, they ran in every direction. A group of them dragged a watchman off his bicycle and killed him. Many prisoners had to make a split-second decision without knowing exactly what was going on. The plan had been kept on a need-to-know basis, so even those who were aware of the revolt knew few details. Pechersky and Feldhendler ran around the yard trying to shepherd prisoners out, but around 175 nonetheless stayed back.

As the crowd surged forward, there was a moment of confusion in which the watchmen in the towers did not react. Itzhak Lichtman reported seeing some of the remaining SS men hiding, perhaps thinking that the camp was being attacked by partisans. After a moment, the watchmen began shooting into the crowd, and some of the prisoners shot with the rifles procured by Szmajzner and with pistols taken from dead SS officers. Szmajzner hit a watchman in a tower, later recalling &quot;I did not do that; God did.&quot;

One group of prisoners ran behind the carpenters shop. The carpenters had left ladders, pliers, and axes lying in the weeds next to the south fence, as a backup plan in case the main gate in the &quot;Vorlager&quot; proved inaccessible. These prisoners scaled the fence, traversed the ditch, and began running through the minefield towards the forest. As they ran, the mines exploded, killing some of the escapees and attracting the attention of the watchmen in the towers who began shooting. Esther Raab felt a bullet graze her head above her right ear. She kept running, but felt herself losing strength. She reached out to hold onto a woman running next to her, but the woman pushed her off and shouted &quot;leave me alone!&quot;

A larger group of prisoners headed for the &quot;Vorlager&quot;. These prisoners tried to escape through the main gate or over the south fence, while a group of Soviet prisoners attempted to raid the armoury. There, they were met with Frenzel, who at this point had gotten out of the shower and was getting himself a pre-roll call drink in the canteen. Attracted by the commotion, Frenzel had grabbed a machine gun and run outside. Seeing the crowd of prisoners heading to the main gate, he opened fire, spraying the crowd of prisoners. Pechersky fired at Frenzel using Vallaster&#x27;s pistol but missed. A group of prisoners attempted to rush the main gate, but were met with another SS officer there shooting into the crowd. Some scattered, but others were pushed forward by the force of those behind them. They trampled the main gate and flooded out.

Others in the &quot;Vorlager&quot; tried to escape over the barbed wire behind the SS officers&#x27; barracks, correctly guessing that there would be fewer mines there. Many prisoners who attempted to get out this way got stuck on the barbed wire. Among these prisoners was Thomas Blatt, who survived because the fence collapsed on top of him. As he lay on the ground, he saw the prisoners in front of him blown up as they crossed the minefield. Blatt freed himself by slipping out of his coat which was stuck on the barbed wire and running across the exploded mines and into the forest.

Roughly 300 prisoners escaped to the forest.

===Aftermath===

Immediately after the escape, in the forest, a group of fifty prisoners followed Pechersky. After a few days, Pechersky and seven other Russian POWs left, claiming that they would return with food. However, they instead left to cross the Bug River and make contact with the partisans. After Pechersky did not return, the remaining prisoners split into smaller groups and sought separate ways.

In 1980, Blatt asked Pechersky why he abandoned the other survivors. Pechersky answered,

Dutch historian and Sobibor survivor Jules Schelvis estimates that 158 inmates perished in the Sobibor revolt, killed by the guards or in the minefield surrounding the camp. A further 107 were killed either by the SS, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers sent by Siegfried Haenicke, or &quot;Orpo&quot; police units pursuing them. Some 53 insurgents died of other causes between the day of the revolt and 8 May 1945. There were 58 known survivors, 48 male and 10 female, from among the &quot;Arbeitshäftlinge&quot; prisoners performing slave-labour for the daily operation of Sobibor. Their time in the camp ranged from several weeks to almost two years.

===Liquidation and demolition===

Once the shooting stopped, the surviving SS secured the camp. They held the remaining prisoners in &quot;Lager I&quot; at gunpoint and executed those found hiding in other areas of the camp. They searched for Niemann, who had been left in charge of the camp while Commandant Reichleitner was on holiday. After the sun set, the search continued in the dark, since the prisoners had cut the powerlines.

Around 8:00 pm, Niemann&#x27;s corpse was found in the tailor&#x27;s barracks and Frenzel assumed command. His first undertaking was to summon reinforcements, thinking that the remaining prisoners would resist and worried that the escapees might launch a second attack. After discovering that the prisoners had cut the phone lines, he went to use the phone at the Sobibór train station, located a few metres outside the camp. He called multiple SS outposts in Lublin and Chełm, as well as a nearby battalion of &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers. Reinforcements were delayed by bureaucratic confusion as well as the railway lines having been blown up by partisans. However, a group of SS officials arrived later that night, including Gottlieb Hering and Christian Wirth. Wirth ordered Erich Bauer to go to summon the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; from Chełm in person, since Frenzel had been unable to reach them by phone. Bauer balked, afraid that he would be attacked on the way.

During the night, the SS combed the camp for hiding prisoners. Many were armed and fought back. Jakub Biskubicz, the &quot;putzer&quot; who Bauer had shot at during the revolt, witnessed this part of the search before escaping:

Until midnight I lay on the earth. I could hear shouts and screams from all directions. At midnight, I heard shooting close to me and the voices of Germans say: &quot;Nobody is here.&quot; They left... I reached [&quot;Lager&quot;] IV. I saw the open door of a watchtower. Nobody was around. I climbed the ladder of the tower and jumped outside over the fences and mines. I fell on the railway and escaped to the forest. 

Early the next day, 15 October, the Sobibor SS were joined by numerous SS including Hermann Höfle, as well as eighty &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers. They marched the remaining 159 prisoners to &quot;Lager III&quot; and shot them. The Nazis launched a manhunt, worried that the advancing Red Army would find the Polish countryside scattered with witnesses to their crimes. SS officers, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers, and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airplanes swept the surrounding area, while locals were offered bounties for assisting. Several SS officers involved in the manhunt were put up for medals for their &quot;incisive action&quot;.

Surviving German documents show that 59 escapees were caught in the nearby villages of Sobibór and Różanka on 17 and 18 October. The Germans recovered weapons from them, including a hand grenade. A few days later, on 21 October, another five Jews were killed by &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers near Adampol and an additional eight in Sawin. In all, records indicate that at least 107 escapees were killed specifically by the Germans, while another 23 are known to have been killed by non-Germans. Jules Schelvis estimates that roughly 30 died in other ways before the end of the war.

On 19 October, SS chief Himmler ordered that the camp be closed. Jewish slave labourers were sent to Sobibor from Treblinka in order to dismantle the camp. They demolished the gas chambers and most of the camp buildings, but left behind several barracks for future use by &quot;Baudienst&quot;. The work was finished by the end of the October, and all of the Jews brought from Treblinka were shot between 1 November and 10 November.

==Aftermath==

===Survivors===
Several thousand deportees to Sobibor were spared the gas chambers because they were transferred to slave-labour camps in the Lublin reservation, upon arriving at Sobibor. These people spent several hours at Sobibor and were transferred almost immediately to slave-labour projects including Majdanek and the Lublin airfield camp, where materials looted from the gassed victims were prepared for shipment to Germany. Other forced labour camps included Krychów, Dorohucza, and Trawniki. Most of these prisoners were murdered in the November 1943 massacre Operation Harvest Festival, or perished in other ways before the end of the war. Of the 34,313 Jews deported to Sobibor from the Netherlands according to train schedules, 18 are known to have survived the war. In June 2019 the last known survivor of the revolt, Simjon Rosenfeld, who was born in what is now Belarus, died at a retirement home near Tel Aviv, Israel, aged 96.

===Trials===
Most perpetrators of Operation Reinhard were never brought to trial. However, there were several Sobibor trials after the war. &quot;SS-Oberscharführer&quot; Erich Bauer was the first SS officer from Sobibor to be tried. Bauer was arrested in 1946 when two former Jewish prisoners from Sobibor, Samuel Lerer and Esther Terner, recognized him at a fairground in the Kreuzberg neighborhood of Berlin. On 8 May 1950, Bauer was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity, though his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment due to West Germany&#x27;s abolition of capital punishment. Terner testified against Bauer, and later recalled thinking &quot;This &quot;nothing&quot; had such power?&quot; The second Sobibor trials occurred shortly after, against Hubert Gomerski and Johann Klier. Gomerski was given a life sentence while Johann Klier was acquitted, in part due to favorable testimony from Terner. 

The third Sobibor trials were the Hagen Trials, which took place in West Germany. The twelve defendants included Karl Frenzel and Kurt Bolender. Frenzel was sentenced to life imprisonment for personally killing 6 Jews and participating in the mass murder of an additional 150,000. Bolender committed suicide before sentencing. Five other defendants were given sentences of less than eight years, and the rest were acquitted.

In the 1970s and 1980s, several SS men were retried. Gomerski was ultimately freed on procedural grounds since he was deemed too ill to participate in the proceedings. Subsequently, Frenzel&#x27;s life sentence was upheld after a retrial in which Gomerski testified.

In the Soviet Union, there were several rounds of trials against Soviet citizens who had served at Sobibor as watchmen. In April 1963, a court in Kyiv convicted eleven former watchmen, sentencing ten to death and one to 15 years in prison. In June 1965, three more watchmen from Sobibor were convicted in Kyiv and executed. Another six were put to death in Krasnodar.

In May 2011, John Demjanjuk was convicted for being an accessory to the murder of 28,060 Jews while serving as a watchman at Sobibor. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released pending appeal. He died in a German nursing home on 17 March 2012, aged 91, while awaiting the hearing.

===The site===


The Germans were driven out of the area in July 1944. In August, Lieutenant Colonel Semion Volsky of the Red Army photographed the site and prepared a report which is on file in the Central Archives of the Russian Ministry of Defence. After the end of the German occupation, the camp&#x27;s remaining barracks were briefly used to house Ukrainian civilians waiting to be resettled. These deportees dismantled several remaining buildings for use as firewood. Parts of the Vorlager were subsequently sold to private individuals, though most of the camp site was returned to the Polish forestry administration.

A September 1945 report by Polish authorities noted that locals had dismantled most of the remaining camp buildings, reusing parts of them in their own houses. This report was corroborated in 2010 when a resident of nearby Żłobek Duży discovered unusual woodwork during a renovation project. Knowing that the previous owner of the house had worked near the camp, they alerted researchers from the Sobibor Museum who concluded that the woodwork was taken from the exterior of a camp barracks. The site was also a target for grave-diggers, who scoured the site for valuables left by the camp&#x27;s victims. When the Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation studied the site in 1945, they found trenches dug by treasure-seekers, who had left the surface strewn with ashes and human remains. Grave-digging continued in the area, despite several prosecutions in the 1960s.

In the first twenty years after the war, the site of the camp was practically deserted. A journalist visiting the site in the early 1950s reported &quot;there is nothing left in Sobibor&quot;. When Gitta Sereny visited the site in March 1972, she initially drove past it without realizing. She later commented that she was struck by &quot;the quiet, the loneliness, above all the vastness of the place, which left everything to the imagination&quot;

The first monuments to Sobibor victims were erected on the site in 1965. Installed by the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites, these consisted of a memorial wall, an obelisk symbolizing the gas chambers, a sculpture of a mother and her child, and a mausoleum called the &quot;Memory Mound&quot;. The memorial wall originally listed Jews as just one of the groups persecuted at Sobibor, but the plaque was revised in 1993 to reflect the general historical consensus that all or nearly all victims of Sobibor were Jews.

In 1993, the Włodawa Museum took over the memorial from the forestry administration. They established the Sobibór Museum which opened on 14 October 1993, the 50th anniversary of the revolt. The museum was housed in a post-war building within the former site of Lager II, which had previously served as a kindergarten. In 2012, the memorial changed hands once again, this time falling under the control of the Majdanek State Museum, who held a design competition sponsored by the governments of Poland, Israel, the Netherlands and Slovakia.

In 2018, the mass graves in the former area of Lager III were covered with white stones, and construction began on a new museum building. However, most of the area of the site is still either privately owned or under the control of the forestry administration, and the camp&#x27;s arrival ramp was used for loading lumber as recently as 2015. Since the forestry tower was demolished in 2004 (after decaying nearly to the point of collapse), the only remaining building from the camp is the green post office. This building is privately owned.

===Research===

In the immediate aftermath of the war, several investigations were carried out. Starting in 1945, the Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation and Central Committee of Polish Jews investigated Sobibor, interviewing witnesses and surveying the site. In 1946, Nachman Blumental published a study entitled &quot;The Death Camp – Sobibór&quot; in 1946, which drew on work by the other investigations, and information about Sobibor was gathered for &quot;The Black Book of Polish Jewry&quot;.

Until the 1990s, little was known about the physical site of the camp beyond what survivors and perpetrators could recall. Archaeological investigations at Sobibor began in the 1990s. In 2001, a team led by Andrzej Kola from Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń investigated the former area of &quot;Lager III&quot;, finding seven pits with a total volume of roughly 19,000 cubic meters. While some of these pits appear to have been mass graves, others may have been used for open air cremation. The team also found pieces of barbed wire embedded in trees, which they identified as remnants of the camp&#x27;s perimeter fence. Thus, they were able to partially map out the perimeter of the former camp site, which had not previously been known.

In 2007, two archaeologists named Wojciech Mazurek and Yoram Haimi began to conduct small-scale investigations. Since 2013, the camp has been excavated by a joint team of Polish, Israeli, Slovak, and Dutch archeologists led by Mazurek, Haimi, and Ivar Schute. In accordance with Jewish law, these excavations avoided mass graves and were supervised by Polish rabbis. Their discovery of the foundations of the gas chambers, in 2014, attracted worldwide media attention. Between 2011 and 2015, thousands of personal items belonging to victims were uncovered by the teams. At the ramp, large dumps of household items, including &quot;glasses, combs, cutlery, plates, watches, coins, razors, thimbles, scissors, toothpaste&quot; were found, but few valuables; Schute suggests that these items are indicative of victims&#x27; hopes to survive as forced labourers. In Lager III, the extermination area, household items were not found but &quot;gold fillings, dentures, pendants, earrings, and a gold ring&quot; were. Schute notes that such objects could have been concealed by naked individuals, and argues that it is evidence for the &quot;processing&quot; of bodies at this location.

In 2020, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum acquired a collection of photographs and documents from the descendants of Johann Niemann. These photos show daily life amongst the camp staff. Many show the perpetrators drinking, playing music, and playing chess with one another. These photos are significant because there had previously only been two known photographs of Sobibor during its operation. These materials have been published in a German language book and ebook by Metropol Verlag entitled &quot;Fotos aus Sobibor&quot;. The photos received voluminous press coverage because two of them appear to show John Demjanjuk in the camp.

===Dramatisations===
The mechanics of Sobibor death camp were the subject of interviews filmed on location for the 1985 documentary film &quot;Shoah&quot; by Claude Lanzmann. In 2001, Lanzmann combined unused interviews with survivor Yehuda Lerner shot during the making of &quot;Shoah&quot;, along with new footage of Lerner, to tell the story of the revolt and escape in his followup documentary &quot;Sobibor, October 14, 1943, 4 p.m.&quot;

A highly fictionalized version of the Sobibor revolt was depicted in the 1978 American TV miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot;.

The revolt was dramatized in the 1987 British TV film &quot;Escape from Sobibor&quot;, directed by Jack Gold and adapted from the book by Richard Rashke. The film&#x27;s consultants included survivors Thomas Blatt, Shlomo Szmajzner, and Esther Raab.

More recently, the revolt was depicted in the 2018 Russian movie &quot;Sobibor&quot;, directed by Konstantin Khabensky. The movie presents Sasha Pechersky as a Russian patriotic figure, a depiction criticized by Garry Kasparov among others.

<text>The General Intelligence and Security Service ( ; AIVD) is the intelligence and security agency of the Netherlands, tasked with domestic, foreign and signals intelligence and protecting national security as well as assisting the Five Eyes in investigating foreign citizens. The military counterpart is the Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), which operates under the Ministry of Defence.

==History==
The history of Dutch intelligence can trace itself back to 1914 with the creation of the Generale Staf III (GS III) during the outbreak of World War I.
The year following the end of the war, GS III was replaced by the Centrale Inlichtingendienst (CI) in 1919. After Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, the Dutch government-in-exile deemed the CI to be inadequate for their war efforts and so created the Bureau Inlichtingen (BI) in 1942.

After the war, in 1945, Netherlands replaced the Bureau of National Security (&quot;Bureau voor Nationale Veiligheid&quot;) and in 1947, was later known as the Domestic Security Service (Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst) (BVD) which would be the predecessor of the AIVD. For the gathering of intelligence abroad, the Foreign Intelligence Service — Buitenlandse Inlichtingendienst (BID), renamed to Inlichtingendienst Buitenland (IDB) in 1972 — had existed since 1946. This service was located in Villa Maarheeze in Wassenaar, just north of The Hague. IDB was dissolved in 1994 after heavy internal turmoil. The foreign intelligence task was eventually handed over to the BVD, which in doing so turned into a combined intelligence and security service. For this reason, it was rebranded Algemene Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdienst (AIVD) on 29 May 2002.

==Mission==
The AIVD focuses mostly on domestic non-military threats to Dutch national security, whereas the Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) focuses on international threats, specifically military and government-sponsored threats such as espionage. The AIVD is charged with collecting intelligence and assisting in combating domestic and foreign threats to national security.

== List of directors-general ==
==Oversight and accountability==
The Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations is politically responsible for the AIVD&#x27;s actions. Oversight is provided by three bodies:
* A review board for the use of special powers by intelligence and security services (Dutch: &quot;Toetsingscommissie Inzet Bevoegdheden&quot;, TIB) appointed by the Second Chamber of the States General.
* An oversight committee (Dutch: &quot;Commissie van Toezicht op de Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdiensten&quot;, CTIVD) also appointed by the Second Chamber of the States General.
* The Committee for the Intelligence and Security Services (Dutch: &quot;Commissie voor de Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdiensten&quot;, CIVD), comprising the leaders of all political parties represented in the Second Chamber of the States General, although until 2009 the Socialist Party (SP) was not and did not want to be part of this committee.

The AIVD publishes an annual report which includes its budget. The published version contains redactions where information is deemed sensitive.

The AIVD can be forced by the courts to publish any records held on a private citizen, but it may keep secret information that is relevant to current cases. No information that is less than five years old will be provided under any circumstance to private citizens about their records.

==Activities==
Its main activities include:
* monitoring specific people and groups of people, such as political and religious extremists
* sourcing intelligence to and from foreign and domestic intelligence services
* performing background checks on individuals employed in &quot;positions of trust&quot;, specifically public office and higher-up or privileged positions in industry (such as telecommunications, banks, and the largest companies)this includes members of parliamentary oversight committees
* investigating incidents such as terrorist bombings and threats
* giving advice and warning about risks to national security, including advising on the protection of national leadership
* Netherlands National Communications Security Agency, advising on communication security for government users

==Methods and authorities==
Its methods and authorities include:
* telephone and internet taps authorized by the minister of internal affairs (as opposed to a court order)
* infiltration (rarely by employees of the service, but rather by outsiders who would have easy access to a particular group)
* the use of informants (existing members of groups that are recruited)
* open sources intelligence
* unfettered access to police intelligence
* the use of foreign intelligence service liaisons who reside in the Netherlands under a diplomatic status (including full diplomatic immunity) to collect intelligence in excess of the AIVD&#x27;s authority

The latter is technically the same as sourcing intelligence from a foreign intelligence service; this method has not been confirmed.

The AIVD operates in tight concert with the Regional Intelligence Service (Regionale Inlichtingen Dienst, RID), to which members of the police are appointed in every police district. It also co-operates with over one hundred intelligence services.

==Criticism==
The service has been criticized for:
* Soon after the arrest of the Dutch businessman Frans van Anraat, who has been convicted of complicity in war crimes for selling raw materials for the production of chemical weapons to Iraq during the reign of Saddam Hussein, Dutch newspapers reported that van Anraat had been an informer of the Dutch secret service AIVD and has enjoyed AIVD&#x27;s protection.
* Letting go of Abdul Qadeer Khan, who stole Dutch nuclear knowledge and used it for Pakistan to produce its nuclear bomb. However, former Prime Minister of the Netherlands Ruud Lubbers claimed in 2005 that this was done on a foreign request.
* Not having enough focus and intelligence on Islamist groups, particularly following the September 11, 2001, attacks and the murder of Theo van Gogh by Mohammed Bouyeri, a member of the Hofstad Network of Islamist terrorism
* Not having enough focus and intelligence on political violence or environmental groups, particularly following the murder of Pim Fortuyn by an environmental radical
* Delivering hand grenades to members of the Hofstadgroep through alleged informer Saleh Bouali
* Investigating family members of the Queen that had had a family rift (Princess Margarita and ), though this was not ordered by the minister of internal affairs, but rather by the Queen&#x27;s office
* Losing a laptop and a floppy disk with classified information from a regional office of the AIVD. The disk was found by an employee of a car rental agency, and subsequently given to Dutch crime-journalist Peter R. de Vries. Information on the disks indicated that the service collected information on Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn and members of his party, as well as on left-wing activists. Among other things, the documents accuse Pim Fortuyn of having sex with underage Moroccan boys.
* During the Cold War the BVD had a reputation for interviewing potential employers of persons they deemed suspicious for any reason, thereby worrying corporations about the employment of these persons. Reasons for being suspect included leftist ideals, membership of the Communist Party, or a spotty military record (such as being a conscientious objector with regard to conscription), although no evidence of the latter has ever been produced.
* In 2024 it was reported that the AIVD and MIVD had recruited journalists to act as their agents domestically and abroad, for which they were paid. This was confirmed in a CTIVD Oversight Committee report. The Dutch Association of Journalists criticized this, with its general-secretary Thomas Bruning saying: &quot;I am ashamed of those who cooperate with this.&quot; The CTIVD also criticized the use of journalists by the AIVD and MIVD, saying they did not properly take into account the risks involved in this activity, particularly in high-risk foreign countries.

==Cozy Bear==
On January 25, 2018, &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; and TV program &quot;Nieuwsuur&quot; reported that in 2014, the AIVD successfully infiltrated the computers of Cozy Bear and observed the hacking of the head office of the Democratic National Committee and subsequently the White House, as well as being the first to alert the National Security Agency (NSA) about the cyber-intrusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenthal_1/25/2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
&quot;In the Lair of the Cozy Bear&quot; (allegedly a translation of the Dutch novel &quot;In het hol van de Cozy Bear&quot;) relates the story of the infiltration of Cozy Bear told from the perspective of an American liaison officer attached to the AIVD.

<doc id="230760" wikidata="Q1754535" url="?curid=230760" title="Pine Gap">
<text>Pine Gap is a joint Australian-United States satellite communications and signals intelligence surveillance base and Australian Earth station approximately south-west of the town of Alice Springs. It is jointly operated by Australia and the United States, and since 1988 it has been officially called the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap (JDFPG); previously, it was known as Joint Defence Space Research Facility. It plays a crucial role in supporting the intelligence activities and military operations of the US around the world. The base&#x27;s role has caused much controversy in Australia leading to various protests.

The station is jointly run by the Australian Defence Force (Australian Signals Directorate), the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), US National Security Agency (NSA), and US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and is a key contributor to the NSA&#x27;s global interception/surveillance effort, which included the ECHELON program. The classified NRO name for the Pine Gap base is Australian Mission Ground Station (AMGS), while the unclassified cover term for the NSA function of the facility is RAINFALL.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC/intercept2017&quot;&gt;Peter Cronau, The Base: Pine Gap&#x27;s Role in US Warfighting , &quot;Background Briefing&quot;, ABC Radio National, 20 August 2017; Ryan Gallagher and Peter Cronau, The U.S. Spy Hub in the Heart of Australia , &quot;The Intercept&quot;, 20 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Base==
The facilities at the base consist of a massive computer complex with 38 radomes protecting radio dishes and operates with over 800 employees. Former NSA employee David Rosenberg indicated that the chief of the facility was a senior CIA officer at the time of his service there.

Australian personnel stationed at the installation have access to the entire facility (depending on role and clearance). However, all Australian personnel are banned from entering the NSA&#x27;s cryptology room, similarly how all US Personnel are banned from the Australian Signals Directorate&#x27;s cryptology room.

The location is strategically significant because it controls United States spy satellites as they pass over one-third of the globe, including China, North Korea, the Asian parts of Russia, and the Middle East. Central Australia was chosen because it was too remote for spy ships passing in international waters to intercept its signals. The facility has become a key part of the local economy.

=== Military activities ===
Pine Gap&#x27;s activities have become more military-focused over time. One of its roles is to detect and geolocate the source of electronic signals, such as those emitted by mobile phones. This information is used by Five Eyes to identify and geolocate targets of interest, which it can then attack using special forces or lethal unmanned drones, for example.

Since it was established, Pine Gap has assisted the US in planning for nuclear war.

Leaked Department of Defence documents revealed that satellites controlled by the Pine Gap and Joint Defence Facility Nurrungar facilities were used during the Vietnam War to pinpoint targets for bombings in Cambodia.

Joint Defence Facility Nurrungar relayed warnings of Scud missile launches to the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) during the Gulf War in the early 1990s. By 2003, this function had been fully transferred to Pine Gap.

Location data provided by Pine Gap was used by the US to kill al-Qaeda and the Taliban soldiers with drones. US drones have also killed hundreds of civilians.

During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, it is alleged Pine Gap provided the IDF with communications and electronic intelligence which it had collected using two geosynchronous Orion satellites located over the Indian Ocean.

==Operational history==
In late 1966, during the Cold War, a joint US–Australian treaty called for the creation of a US satellite surveillance base in Australia, to be titled the &quot;Joint Defence Space Research Facility&quot;. The purpose of the facility was initially referred to in public as &quot;space research&quot;. It was officially referred to as a &quot;joint space research facility&quot; until 1988. The Pine Gap treaty was signed on 9 December 1966 and stated that, after an initial nine years, either Australia or the US could cancel the agreement on giving one year&#x27;s notice.

Operations started in 1970 when about 400 American families moved to Central Australia. The function of the base when it first opened was to monitor military activities such as missile tests in Russia, China, Pakistan, Japan, Korea, and India..

The base was placed on nuclear alert by the US Government during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 when US secretary of state Henry Kissinger issued a DEFCON 3 force-wide alert. Australian personnel at the base, the Australian Government and Prime Minister Gough Whitlam were not informed of the alert.

Since the end of the Cold War in 1991 and the rise of the war on terror in 2001, the base has seen a refocusing from mere nuclear treaty monitoring and missile launch detection, to become a vital warfighting base for US military forces. In 1999, with the Australian Government refusing to give details to an Australian Senate committee about the relevant treaties, intelligence expert Professor Des Ball from the Australian National University was called to give an outline of Pine Gap. According to Ball, since 9 December 1966 when the Australian and United States governments signed the Pine Gap treaty, Pine Gap had grown from the original two antennas to about 18 in 1999, and 38 by 2017. The number of staff had increased from around 400 in the early 1980s to 600 in the early 1990s and then to 800 in 2017, the biggest expansion since the end of the Cold War.

Ball described the facility as the ground control and processing station for geosynchronous satellites engaged in signals intelligence collection, outlining four categories of signals collected:

*telemetry from advanced weapons development, such as ballistic missiles, used for arms control verification;
*signals from anti-missile and anti-aircraft radars;
*transmissions intended for communications satellites; and
*microwave emissions, such as long-distance telephone calls.

Ball described the operational area as containing three sections: Satellite Station Keeping Section, Signals Processing Station and the Signals Analysis Section, from which Australians were barred until 1980. Each morning the Joint Reconnaissance Schedule Committee meets to determine what the satellites will monitor over the next 24 hours.

With the closing of Nurrungar in 1999, an area in Pine Gap was set aside for the United States Air Force&#x27;s control station for Defense Support Program satellites that monitor heat emissions from missiles, giving first warning of ballistic missile launches. In 2004, the base began operating a new satellite system known as the Space-Based Infrared System, which is a vital element of US missile defence.

Since the end of the Cold War, the station has mainly been employed to intercept and record weapons and communications signals from countries in Asia, such as China and North Korea. The station was active in supporting the wars in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq and every US war since the September 11 attacks.

The Menwith Hill Station (MHS) in the UK is operated by the NSA and also serves as ground station for these satellite missions.

One of Pine Gap&#x27;s primary functions is to locate radio signals in the Eastern Hemisphere, with the collected information fed into the US drone program. This was confirmed by an NSA document from 2013, which says that Pine Gap plays a key role in providing geolocation data for intelligence purposes, as well as for military operations, including air strikes.

On 11 July 2013, documents revealed through former NSA analyst Edward Snowden showed that Pine Gap, amongst three other locations in Australia and one in New Zealand, contributed to the NSA&#x27;s global interception and collection of internet and telephone communications, which involves systems like XKEYSCORE. Journalist Brian Toohey states that Pine Gap intercepts electronic communications from Australian citizens including phone calls, emails and faxes as a consequence of the technology it uses.

According to documents published in August 2017, Pine Gap is used as a ground station for spy satellites on two secret missions:
*Mission 7600 with 2 geosynchronous satellites to cover Eurasia and Africa
*Mission 8300 with 4 geosynchronous satellites that covered the former Soviet Union, China, South Asia, East Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and countries on the Atlantic Ocean
After the inexplicable March 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370, a Boeing 777 passenger jet, authorities suggested that Pine Gap or Jindalee (JORN) radar site might have data to help locate the missing aircraft.

==Whitlam dismissal==
Gough Whitlam, Prime Minister of Australia (between 1972 and 1975), considered closing the base. Victor Marchetti, a former CIA officer who had helped set up the facility, said that this consideration &quot;caused apoplexy in the White House, [and] a kind of Chile [coup] was set in motion&quot;, with the CIA and MI6 working together to get rid of the Prime Minister. On 11 November 1975, the day Whitlam was scheduled to brief the Australian Parliament on the secret CIA presence in Australia, as well as it being &quot;the last day of action if an election of any kind was to be held before Christmas&quot;, he was dismissed from office by ceremonial representative of monarch Elizabeth II, Governor-General John Kerr, using reserve powers, described as &quot;archaic&quot; by critics of the decision. 

In 2020, previously confidential private correspondences between the Palace and the Governor-General were released. In one of the letters, John Kerr describes his alleged CIA connections as &quot;Nonsense of course&quot;, and assured the Queen of his continued loyalty. Nonetheless, according to revelations from CIA whistleblower Christopher John Boyce, Kerr allegedly maintained ties with CIA-funded organizations and was referred to as &#x27;our man Kerr&#x27; by the agency.

==Allegations of Christopher Boyce==
During his trial for espionage, US defence industry employee Christopher Boyce made a number of allegations related to the intelligence gathered at Pine Gap (including claiming that the CIA was involved in the Whitlam Dismissal). He stated that, despite the US agreeing to share intelligence from Pine Gap with Australia, he was told that the US did and would withhold some information from the Australians. Boyce also said that Pine Gap was monitoring telephone calls and telex messages to and from Australia of a political nature.

==Protests==
*On 11 November 1983, Aboriginal women led 700 women to the Pine Gap gates where they fell silent for 11 minutes to commemorate Remembrance Day and the Greenham Common protest in Britain. This was the beginning of a two-week, women-only peace camp, organised under the auspices of &quot;Women For Survival&quot;. The gathering was nonviolent but several women trespassed onto the military base. 111 women were arrested on one particular day and gave their names as Karen Silkwood, an American nuclear worker who died after campaigning for nuclear safety. There were allegations of police brutality and an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry ensued.
*On 5–7 October 2002, a number of groups (including Quakers and the National Union of Students) gathered at the gates of Pine Gap to protest the use of the base in the then-impending Iraq war.
*In December 2005, six members of the Christians Against All Terrorism group staged a protest outside Pine Gap. Four of them later broke into the facility and were arrested. Their trial began on 3 October 2006 and was the first time that Australia&#x27;s Defense (Special Undertakings) Act 1952 was used. The Pine Gap Four cross-appealed to have their convictions quashed. In February 2008, the four members successfully appealed their convictions and were acquitted.
*On 28 September 2016, a group of five people calling themselves “Peace Pilgrims” entered the prohibited zone around Pine Gap and were arrested and tried for trespass.
*On 20 October 2023, pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked Hatt Road, the entryway to Pine Gap, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Protesters blockaded Hatt Road, the main access road to Pine Gap in late November 2023 due to concerns that information collected at the facility was being passed to the IDF and being used to identify targets within Gaza during the 2023 Israel-Hamas War.

==In popular culture==
Peter &quot;Turbo&quot; Teatoff is seen delivering heavy machinery to JDFPG in season 4&#x27;s 11th episode of series &quot;Outback Truckers&quot;.

Pine Gap features prominently in the third and fourth thriller novels of the &quot;Jack West Jr.&quot; series—&quot;The Five Greatest Warriors&quot; and &quot;The Four Legendary Kingdoms&quot;, respectively—by the Australian writer Matthew Reilly.

Pine Gap is featured in the 2018 Australian television series of the same name. The series is a political thriller, portraying the lives of the members of the joint American–Australian intelligence team.

In the novel, &quot;The Secret History of Twin Peaks&quot; by Mark Frost, President Richard Nixon claims that Pine Gap is actually the site of an underground facility constructed by extraterrestrials.

In 1982 the Australian band Midnight Oil released &quot;Power and the Passion&quot;, which contains a reference to Pine Gap.

On 6 March 2024, Australian YouTubers Aleksa Vulović, Alex Apollonov and Jordan Shanks uploaded a video to Vulović&#x27;s channel Boy Boy, in which the trio attempted to enter Pine Gap. The trio were briefly detained and questioned after being denied entry at the front gate. The next day, upon arrival at Sydney Airport, the trio were further questioned by the Australian Federal Police immediately after leaving the aircraft. The video featured an interview with Donna Mulhearn, one of the six members of the Christians Against All Terrorism group who attempted to sneak into Pine Gap in 2006, along with the discussion of the alleged CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal.

<text>The Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism () is a non-profit cultural institute based in Denmark.

It was founded in 1961 by the Danish artist Asger Jorn, Peter Glob and Werner Jacobsen from the National Museum of Denmark and Holger Arbman of the University of Lund, Sweden. Jorn had recently left the Situationist International, although he continued to support them financially. The stated purpose of the institute was to throw new light upon the Scandinavian culture in the age of migrations and Vikings. For several years, Jorn toured around Scandinavia and Europe with photographer Gérard Franceschi, former photographer for French writer and onetime culture minister André Malraux on his &quot;Musée imaginaire&quot; project, photographing ancient, Romanesque, Scandinavian, and Gothic figurative and decorative motifs in order to trace the connections between Scandinavian and European motifs. Jacqueline de Jong was also involved in several of these excursions.

In 1965, the Silkeborg municipal government provided a building to store over 20,000 photographs taken by Jorn, Gerard Franceschi and Ulrik Ross. Jorn was working with the publisher Skandinavisk Forlag in Odense to publish a series of books based on his research and documentation called &quot;10,000 Years of Nordic Folk Art&quot; (&quot;10 000 års nordisk folkekunst&quot;). Jorn gave up the project that year, however, when the press Skandinavisk Forlag refused to proceed unless the project was run by a committee of scholars, with Jorn having only one vote. He wanted total control of the subject of each volume. The Institute remained as a sort of imaginary museum, now housed in the Silkeborg Kunstmuseum, home of Jorn&#x27;s art collection and archives. Jorn continued to publish articles and books on the subject of Nordic art as a tradition independent of what he called the &quot;Classical-Latin&quot; tradition.

A publication series of theoretical texts (without illustration) in the name of the institute (&quot;Meddelelse fra Skandinavisk institut for sammenlignende vandalisme&quot;) encompasses four books, all by Jorn

<doc id="230762" wikidata="Q507699" url="?curid=230762" title="Edward Young">
<text>Edward Young ( – 5 April 1765) was an English poet, best remembered for &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot;, a series of philosophical writings in blank verse, reflecting his state of mind following several bereavements. It was one of the most popular poems of the century, influencing Goethe and Edmund Burke, among many others, and at the end of the century was illustrated by William Blake.

Young took holy orders, and wrote many fawning letters in search of preferment, attracting accusations of insincerity.

==Early life==
Young was a son of Edward Young, later Dean of Salisbury, and was born at his father&#x27;s rectory at Upham, near Winchester, where he was baptised on 3 July 1683. He was educated at Winchester College, and matriculated at New College, Oxford, in 1702. He later migrated to Corpus Christi, and in 1708 was nominated by Archbishop Tenison to a law fellowship at All Souls. He took his degree of Doctor of Canon Law in 1719.

==Literary career==
Young&#x27;s first publication was an &quot;Epistle to ... Lord Lansdoune&quot; (1713). This was followed by a &quot;Poem on the Last Day&quot; (1713), dedicated to Queen Anne; &quot;The Force of Religion: or Vanquished Love&quot; (1714), a poem on the execution of Lady Jane Grey and her husband, dedicated to the Countess of Salisbury; and an epistle to Joseph Addison, &quot;On the late Queen&#x27;s Death and His Majesty&#x27;s Accession to the Throne&quot; (1714), in which he rushed to praise the new king. The fulsome style of the dedications jars with the pious tone of the poems, and they are omitted from his own edition of his works.

About this time he came into contact with Philip, Duke of Wharton, whom he accompanied to Dublin in 1717. In 1719 his play, &quot;Busiris&quot; was produced at Drury Lane, and in 1721 his &quot;The Revenge&quot;. The latter play was dedicated to Wharton, to whom it owed, said Young, its &quot;most beautiful incident&quot;. Wharton promised him two annuities of £100 each and a sum of £600 in consideration of his expenses as a candidate for parliamentary election at Cirencester. In view of these promises Young refused two livings in the gift of All Souls College, Oxford, and sacrificed a life annuity offered by the Marquess of Exeter if he would act as tutor to his son. Wharton failed to discharge his obligations, and Young, who pleaded his case before Lord Chancellor Hardwicke in 1740, gained the annuity but not the £600. Between 1725 and 1728 Young published a series of seven satires on &quot;The Universal Passion&quot;. They were dedicated to the Duke of Dorset, George Bubb Dodington, Sir Spencer Compton, Lady Elizabeth Germain and Sir Robert Walpole, and were collected in 1728 as &quot;Love of Fame, the Universal Passion&quot;. This is qualified by Samuel Johnson as a &quot;very great performance&quot;, and abounds in striking and pithy couplets. Herbert Croft asserted that Young made £3000 by his satires, which compensated losses he had suffered in the South Sea Bubble. In 1726 he received, through Walpole, a pension of £200 a year. To the end of his life he continued to seek preferment, but the king regarded his pension as an adequate settlement.

Young, living in a time when patronage was slowly fading out, was notable for urgently seeking patronage for his poetry, his theatrical works, and his career in the church: he failed in each area. He never received the degree of patronage that he felt his work had earned, largely because he picked patrons whose fortunes were about to turn downward.

Though his praise was often unearned, often fulsome, he could write, &quot;False praises are the whoredoms of the pen / And prostitute fair fame to worthless men.&quot;

In 1728 Young became a royal chaplain, and in 1730 he obtained the college living of Welwyn, Hertfordshire. In 1731 he married Lady Elizabeth Lee, daughter of the 1st Earl of Lichfield. Her daughter, by a former marriage with her cousin Francis Lee, married Henry Temple, son of the 1st Viscount Palmerston. Mrs Temple died at Lyons in 1736 on her way to Nice. Her husband and Lady Elizabeth Young died in 1740. These successive deaths are supposed to be the events referred to in the &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; as taking place &quot;ere thrice yon moon had filled her horn.&quot;

==&quot;Night-Thoughts&quot;==
In the preface to &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; Young states that the occasion of the poem was real, and Philander and Narcissa have been rather rashly identified with Mr and Mrs Temple. It has also been suggested that Philander represents Thomas Tickell, an old friend of Young&#x27;s, who died three months after Lady Elizabeth Young. The infidel Lorenzo was thought by some to be a sketch of Young&#x27;s own son, but he was only eight years old at the time of publication. &quot;The Complaint&quot;, or &quot;Night Thoughts on Life, Death and Immortality&quot;, was published in 1742, and was followed by other &quot;Nights,&quot; the eighth and ninth appearing in 1745. In 1753, his tragedy of &quot;The Brothers&quot;, written many years previous but suppressed because he was about to enter the Church, was produced at Drury Lane. &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; had made him famous, but he lived in almost uninterrupted retirement. He was made clerk of the closet to the Princess Dowager, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, in 1761. He never recovered from his wife&#x27;s death. He fell out with his son, who had apparently criticised the excessive influence exerted by his housekeeper Mrs Hallows. The old man refused to see his son until shortly before he died, but left him everything. A description of him is to be found in the letters of his curate and executor, John Jones, to Dr Thomas Birch (in Brit. Lib. &quot;Addit. M/s&quot; 4311). He died at Welwyn, reconciled with his spendthrift son: &quot;he expired a little before 11 of the clock at the night of Good Friday last, the 5th instant, and was decently buried yesterday about 6 in the afternoon&quot; (Jones to Birch).

Young is said to have been a brilliant talker. Although &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; is long and disconnected, it abounds in brilliant isolated passages. Its success was enormous. It was translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Welsh, Polish and Magyar. In France it became a classic of the romantic school. Questions as to the &quot;sincerity&quot; of the poet did arise in the 100 years after his death. The publication of fawning letters from Young seeking preferment led many readers to question the poet&#x27;s sincerity. In a famous essay, &quot;Worldliness and Other-Worldliness&quot;, George Eliot discussed his &quot;radical insincerity as a poetic artist.&quot; If Young did not invent &quot;melancholy and moonlight&quot; in literature, he did much to spread the fashionable taste for them. Madame Klopstock thought the king ought to make him Archbishop of Canterbury, and some German critics preferred him to John Milton. Young&#x27;s essay, &quot;Conjectures on Original Composition&quot;, was popular and influential on the continent, especially among Germans, as a testament advocating originality over neoclassical imitation. Young wrote good blank verse, and Samuel Johnson pronounced &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; to be one of &quot;the few poems&quot; in which blank verse could not be changed for rhyme but with disadvantage. The poem was a poetic treatment of sublimity and had a profound influence on the young Edmund Burke, whose philosophic investigations and writings on the Sublime and the Beautiful were a pivotal turn in 18th-century aesthetic theory.

Young&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; emerged from obscurity by being mentioned in Edmund Blunden&#x27;s World War One memoir, &quot;Undertones of War&quot; (1928), as a source of comfort during time in the trenches. This latter work emerged from the darkness of the more recent past thanks to its mention and discussion in Paul Fussell&#x27;s &quot;The Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (1975), which discussed Blunden&#x27;s reliance on &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot;. Blunden&#x27;s mention of Young&#x27;s poem reintroduced an interesting, sometimes bombastic precursor to the early Romantics to students of English literature.

Samuel Richardson in a letter to bookseller Andrew Millar discussed a new edition of Young&#x27;s poem, &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; (1750), which was already very popular, and which would become one of the most frequently-printed poems of the eighteenth century. Millar had purchased the copyright to the second volume of &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; (parts 7–11) from Young for £63 on 7 April 1749; the edition under discussion was the first in which Millar was involved, and it would be advertised for sale in the General Advertiser on 30 January 1750.

William Hutchinson included a gloss on &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; in his series of lectures &quot;The Spirit of Masonry&quot; (1775), underlining the masonic symbolism of the text.

==Influence on romanticism==

In 1759, at the age of 76, he published a piece of critical prose under the title of &quot;Conjectures on Original Composition&quot; which put forward the vital doctrine of the superiority of &quot;genius,&quot; of innate originality being more valuable than classic indoctrination or imitation, and suggested that modern writers might dare to rival or even surpass the &quot;ancients&quot; of Greece and Rome. 

The Conjectures was a declaration of independence against the tyranny of classicism and was at once acclaimed as such becoming a milestone in the history of English, and European, literary criticism. It was immediately translated into German at Leipzig and at Hamburg and was widely and favourably reviewed. The cult of genius exactly suited the ideas of the Sturm und Drang movement and gave a new impetus to the cult of Young’ (Harold Forster, ‘Some uncollected authors XLV: Edward Young in translation I’).

The young Goethe told his sister in 1766 that he was learning English from Young and Milton, and in his autobiography he confessed that Young&#x27;s influence had created the atmosphere in which there was such a universal response to his seminal work &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;. Young&#x27;s name soon became a battle-cry for the young men of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement. Young himself reinforced his reputation as a pioneer of romanticism by precept as well as by example.

==Clerical career==
Young was forty-seven when he took holy orders. It was reported that the author of &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; was not, in his earlier days, &quot;the ornament to religion and morality which he afterwards became&quot;, and his friendships with the Duke of Wharton and with Dodington did not improve his reputation. A statement attributed to Alexander Pope is that: &quot;He had much of a sublime genius, though without common sense; so that his genius, having no guide, was perpetually liable to degenerate into bombast. This made him pass a foolish youth, the sport of peers and poets; but his having a very good heart enabled him to support the clerical character when he assumed it, first with decency and afterwards with honour&quot; (O Ruffhead, &quot;Life of A. Pope&quot;, p. 291).

==Other works==
Other works by Young are:
* &quot;Busiris, King of Egypt&quot; (1719), a play
* &quot;The Revenge&quot; (1721), a play 
*&quot;The Instalment&quot; (to Sir R. Walpole, 1726)
*&quot;Cynthio&quot; (1727)
* &quot;The Brothers&quot; (1728), a play
*&quot;A Vindication of Providence ...&quot; (1728), a sermon
*&quot;An Apology for Punch&quot; (1729), a sermon
*&quot;Imperium Pelagi, a Naval Lyrick ...&quot; (1730)
*&quot;Two Epistles to Mr Pope concerning the Authors of the Age&quot; (1730)
*&quot;A Sea-Piece ...&quot; (1733)
*&quot;The Foreign Address, or The Best Argument for Peace&quot; (1734)
*&quot;The Centaur not Fabulous; in Five Letters to a Friend&quot; (1755)
*&quot;An Argument ... for the Truth of His [Christ&#x27;s] Religion&quot; (1758), a sermon preached before the king
*&quot;Conjectures on Original Composition ...&quot; (1759), addressed to Samuel Richardson
*&quot;Resignation ...&quot; (1762), a poem.

&quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; was illustrated by William Blake in 1797, and by Thomas Stothard in 1799. &quot;The Poetical Works of the Rev. Edward Young ...&quot; were revised by himself for publication, and a completed edition appeared in 1778. &quot;The Complete Works, Poetry and Prose, of the Rev. Edward Young ..., with a life by John Doran&quot;, appeared in 1854. Sir Herbert Croft wrote the life included in Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;, but the critical remarks are by Johnson. Selections from &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; was also set by New England Congregationalist composer William Billings in his &quot;Easter Anthem&quot;.

<text>The Bördekreis was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from north clockwise) Ohrekreis, district-free city of Magdeburg, Schönebeck, Aschersleben-Staßfurt, Quedlinburg, Halberstadt and the district Helmstedt in Lower Saxony.

== History ==
The district was created in 1994 when the two districts Oschersleben and Wanzleben were merged. Both precursor districts were created in 1816 under the Prussian government, and only underwent small changes in the time until their inclusion into the new district. In 2007 the districts of Bördekreis and Ohrekreis were merged into a new .

== Geography ==
The district got its name from the landscape it is located in, the &quot;Magdeburger Börde&quot;. Due to the fertile loess soil it was for long an agricultural area.

The highest elevation is the Heidberg (211 m) east of Sommersdorf. There are several small rivers in the district, the most known one is the Aller.

<doc id="230771" wikidata="Q75852" url="?curid=230771" title="Hartmann von Aue">
<text>Hartmann von Aue, also known as Hartmann von Ouwe, (born &quot;c.&quot; 1160–70, died &quot;c.&quot; 1210–20) was a German knight and poet. With his works including &quot;Erec&quot;, &quot;Iwein&quot;, &quot;Gregorius&quot;, and &quot;Der arme Heinrich&quot;, he introduced the Arthurian romance into German literature and, with Wolfram von Eschenbach and Gottfried von Strassburg, was one of the three great epic poets of Middle High German literature.

==Life==
Hartmann belonged to the lower nobility of Swabia, where he was born. After receiving a monastic education, he became retainer (&quot;Dienstmann&quot;) of a nobleman whose domain, Aue, has been identified with Obernau on the River Neckar. He also took part in the Crusade of 1197. The date of his death is as uncertain as that of his birth; he is mentioned in Gottfried von Strassburg&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot; () as still alive, and in the &quot;Crône&quot; of Heinrich von dem Türlin, written about 1220, he is mourned for as dead.

==Works==
Hartmann produced four narrative poems which are of importance for the evolution of the Middle High German court epic. The first of these, &quot;Erec&quot;, which may have been written as early as 1191 or 1192, and the last, &quot;Iwein&quot;, belong to the Arthurian cycle and are based on epics by Chrétien de Troyes (&quot;Erec and Enide&quot; and &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, respectively). While the story of Chretien&#x27;s &quot;Yvain&quot; refers to events in Chretien&#x27;s &quot;Lancelot&quot;, to explain that Arthur is not present to help because Guinevere has been kidnapped, Hartmann did not adapt Chretien&#x27;s &quot;Lancelot&quot;. The result is that Hartmann&#x27;s &quot;Erec&quot; introduces entirely different explanations for Guinevere&#x27;s kidnapping, which do not correspond to what occurred in the shared literary tradition of Chretien&#x27;s Arthurian romances.

His other two narrative poems are &quot;Gregorius&quot;, also an adaptation of a French epic, and &quot;Der arme Heinrich&quot;, which tells the story of a leper cured by a young girl who is willing to sacrifice her life for him. The source of this tale evidently came from the lore of the noble family whom Hartmann served. &quot;Gregorius&quot;, &quot;Der arme Heinrich&quot; and Hartmann&#x27;s lyrics, which are all fervidly religious in tone, imply a tendency towards asceticism, but, on the whole, Hartmann&#x27;s striving seems rather to have been to reconcile the extremes of life; to establish a middle way of human conduct between the worldly pursuits of knighthood and the ascetic ideals of medieval religion. Translations have been made into modern German of all Hartmann&#x27;s poems, while &quot;Der arme Heinrich&quot; has repeatedly attracted the attention of modern poets, both English (Longfellow, Rossetti) and German (notably, Gerhart Hauptmann).

He was also a Minnesänger, and 18 of his songs survive.

<text>Gerhart Johann Robert Hauptmann (; 15 November 1862 – 6 June 1946) was a German dramatist and novelist. He is counted among the most important promoters of literary naturalism, though he integrated other styles into his work as well. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1912.

==Life==
===Childhood and youth===
Gerhart Hauptmann was born in 1862 in Obersalzbrunn, now known as Szczawno-Zdrój, in Lower Silesia (then a part of the Kingdom of Prussia, now a part of Poland). His parents were Robert and Marie Hauptmann, who ran a hotel in the area. As a youth, Hauptmann had a reputation of being loose with the truth. His elder brother was Carl Hauptmann.

Beginning in 1868, he attended the village school and then, in 1874, the Realschule in Breslau for which he had only barely passed the qualifying exam. Hauptmann had difficulties adjusting himself to his new surroundings in the city. He lived, along with his brother Carl, in a somewhat run-down student boarding house before finding lodging with a pastor.

He ran into problems with the Prussian-influenced school. Above all were the strictness of the teachers and the better treatment of his noble classmates. His dislike and numerous illnesses kept him from attending class, which led to his having to repeat his first year. Over time, he came to appreciate Breslau because of the opportunity to visit the theater.

In the spring of 1878, Hauptmann left the Realschule to learn agriculture on his uncle&#x27;s farm in Lohnig (today Łagiewniki Średzkie in Gmina Udanin, Poland). After a year and a half, however, he had to break off his training. He was not physically prepared for the work and he had contracted a life-threatening lung ailment that troubled him for the next twenty months.

===Studies and life as a sculptor===

After he failed to pass an officer entry exam for the Prussian Army, Hauptmann entered the sculpture school at the Royal Art and Vocational School in Breslau in 1880. There he met Josef Block who became a lifelong friend. He was temporarily expelled for &quot;poor behavior and insufficient diligence,&quot; but quickly reinstated on the recommendation of the sculptor and Professor Robert Härtel. Hauptmann left the school in 1882.

For his brother&#x27;s wedding, he wrote a short play, &quot;Liebesfrühling&quot;, which was performed on the night before. Also at the wedding, he met the bride&#x27;s sister, Marie Thienemann. They became secretly engaged and she began supporting him financially, which enabled him to begin a semester of philosophy and literary history at the University of Jena, which he soon quit.

After he left Jena, Marie financed a Mediterranean trip, which he undertook with his brother Carl. There he decided to settle in Rome as a sculptor, but with little success. His attempt to establish himself as part of Rome&#x27;s German expatriate community also failed and his large clay sculpture of a German warrior collapsed. Hauptmann returned disappointed to Germany, where he began a brief stint at the Royal Academy in Dresden before beginning to study history at the University of Berlin. While there, he devoted his interests to the theater rather than to his studies. In 1891 he moved to Schreiberhau in Silesia.

===Marriage and beginning as a writer===
Hauptmann married Marie Thienemann in Radebeul on 5 May 1885. In July, they took their honeymoon to Rügen along with Carl and his wife, Marie&#x27;s sister, Martha. They visited the island of Hiddensee, which would become a favorite retreat of Hauptmann&#x27;s. Because the city air bothered Gerhart&#x27;s lungs, the couple spent the first four years of their marriage in the town of Erkner, where their three sons were born. In 1889, they moved to Charlottenburg in Berlin. There he joined the naturalist literary club &quot;Durch&quot;, which included among others Karl Bleibtreu and Wilhelm Bölsche.

During this period he began to write. His 1887 novella &quot;Bahnwärter Thiel&quot; was published the following year. His first play, &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, was first staged in 1889, directed by Otto Brahm. It inaugurated the naturalistic movement in modern German literature. It was followed by &quot;The Reconciliation&quot; (1890), &quot;Lonely People&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Weavers&quot; (1892), a powerful drama depicting the rising of the Silesian weavers in 1844, for which he is best known outside of Germany. His work also included comedies, including &quot;Colleague Crampton&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Beaver Coat&quot; (1893).

In 1893, he also took actress Margarete Marschalk as his lover. In order to get some distance, Marie moved to the US with their sons. Hauptmann prepared the first French performance of his play &quot;The Assumption of Hannele&quot; and then went after Marie, without even staying for the premiere. The rift, however, was not to be bridged. After several years of separation, the marriage was ended in July 1904. However, Marie continued to live in the villa Hauptmann had built in Dresden.

===Recognition and World War I===
From 1901, Hauptmann lived with Margarete Marschalk in Agnetendorf (today Jagniątków in Poland). He called it &quot;the mystical protective sheathing of my soul&quot;. In the preceding year, Margarete had borne him a son, Benvenuto. In September 1904, they were married; this second marriage lasted until his death, though it was thrown into a serious crisis in 1905 and 1906 by his affair with a 16-year-old actress, Ida Orloff.

In 1910, Hauptmann&#x27;s first full-length novel was published, &quot;The Fool in Christ, Emanuel Quint&quot;, which told the story of a wandering preacher who mixed sun worship with Christianity. His 1912 novel, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, became the basis for a Danish silent film of the same name. The novel was written one month before the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster, and the film&#x27;s 1913 release was less than one year after the event.

The storyline for both involved a romance aboard a doomed ocean liner, and the similarity to the disaster became obvious. This coincidental untimeliness caused the film to be banned in Norway, due to perceived insensitivity. Nevertheless, excited by the possibilities of this new medium, Hauptmann wrote several screenplays, none of which were ever filmed.

Around the turn of the century, Hauptmann began to receive official recognition. Three times he was awarded the Austrian Franz-Grillparzer-Preis. He also received honorary doctorates from Worcester College at Oxford in 1905 and from the University of Leipzig in 1909. In 1912, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature &quot;primarily in recognition of his fruitful, varied and outstanding production in the realm of dramatic art&quot;, after he had been nominated in that year by Erich Schmidt, member of the Prussian Academy of Science.

Kaiser Wilhelm II, however, did not care for the &quot;social democratic&quot; poet. He vetoed the awarding of the 1896 Schiller Preis (for &quot;The Assumption of Hannele&quot;) and at the instigation of his son, Crown Prince Wilhelm, in 1913, a Breslau production of Hauptmann&#x27;s play &quot;Commemoration Masque&quot; (&quot;Festspiel in deutschen Reimen&quot;) was canceled, because in it the hundredth anniversary of the Liberation of Germany from Napoleon was depicted with a pacifistic rather than patriotic tone. However, the very same Hauptmann who had criticized militarism in the &quot;Masque&quot;, the very next year was among those who supported the war.

Hauptmann signed the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, a manifesto signed by 93 German scientists, scholars and artists, declaring their unequivocal support of German military actions at the beginning of World War I. He published supportive poems (many of which read as unintentional satires and which he later crossed out in the manuscript).

In 1915, Wilhelm II awarded him the Order of the Red Eagle, Fourth Class. After Germany&#x27;s military defeat and the fall of the monarchy, Hauptmann fled to the pacifist colony Monte Verità in Locarno, Switzerland. Several years later, he wrote &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;, a poetic memorial to Hans Paasche, the pacifist and reformer who was assassinated by ultra-nationalists.

===Representative poet of Germany===

In 1918, he joined a declaration, signed by a number of German intellectuals and published in the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; newspaper, showing solidarity with the Republic. During the early years of the republic, he was considered as a candidate for the Reichspräsident and offered the position of Reichskanzler, which he turned down.

In the following years, he was the first recipient of the Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches (The Eagle Shield of the German Reich) an award for scholarly or artistic achievement. During this period, the demand for Hauptmann&#x27;s work had declined, to the point where, in order to maintain his lifestyle, he had begun to do films and serializations. Despite this, he continued to enjoy popularity. He was seen abroad as the representative of German Literature. In 1932, in honor of the centenary of Goethe&#x27;s death, he went on a lecture tour of the United States and was awarded and honorary doctorate from Columbia University. In addition he was awarded the Goethe Prize of the city of Frankfurt am Main.

On his 70th birthday, he was awarded several honorary citizenships. There were countless exhibitions and performances of his work, many with well-known performers. Max Reinhardt played the lead in the premiere of Hauptmann&#x27;s new play &quot;Before Sunset.&quot; From 1926 to 1943, Hauptmann summered with his family in Hiddensee.

===The Nazi era===
After the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Hauptmann signed a loyalty oath of the German Academy of Literature, a section of the Prussian Academy of Arts. In the summer of the same year, according to writer and historian Ernst Klee, he applied for membership in the Nazi party but his application was denied by the regional party office.

Hauptmann&#x27;s copy of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, which can now be found in the Hauptmann collection at the Berlin State Library, was heavily annotated. He regarded himself as being fundamentally a poet, above the political fray; and certainly nothing from the Nazi ideology was incorporated into his works. However, he had earlier been a founding member of the eugenics organization the German Society for Racial Hygiene, in Berlin in 1905, and his play &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; is deeply concerned with hereditary alcoholism, a popular idea with eugenicists, and the main character rejects his fiancée due to concerns about his potential children&#x27;s genetics.

Because Hauptmann remained highly regarded by the German people, the Nazis did everything to keep him from leaving the country, despite the emigration of many of his colleagues. At times he suffered from official disapproval. The censors of the Propaganda Minister Goebbels kept an eye on Hauptmann&#x27;s work and even banned a new edition of his novella &quot;The Shot in the Park&quot; because it featured a black character. Hauptmann was told that reprinting was impossible because of a paper shortage. The film versions of &quot;The Beaver Coat&quot; and &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; were censored, and the film adaptation of &quot;Schluck and Jau&quot; was banned. For Hauptmann&#x27;s 80th birthday, in 1942, representatives of the Nazi regime cooperated with honors, celebrations, and celebratory performances. Hauptmann was presented by his publisher with the first copy of his 17-volume Complete Works.
Hauptmann lived through the end of World War II at his house, Wiesenstein. In 1944, he published his Atreus Tetralogy, which he had been working on for four years. It comprises &quot;Iphigenia in Delphi&quot;, &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot;, &quot;Agamemnon&#x27;s Death&quot;, and &quot;Electra&quot;. In 1944, Hauptmann&#x27;s name was included in the Gottbegnadeten list (the &quot;God-gifted list&quot;), a list of artists considered crucial to the German culture, who were therefore exempt from mobilization in the war effort. He was one of the six most important writers in the special list of the &quot;irreplaceable artists.&quot;.

During the bombing of Dresden, Hauptmann was staying at a Dresden sanatorium due to severe pneumonia. He said of the inferno, &quot;Whoever had forgotten how to cry learned again at the destruction of Dresden. I stand at the end of my life and envy my dead comrades, who were spared this experience.&quot;

After the war, Silesia, where Hauptmann was living, became part of Poland, but Hauptmann was temporarily allowed to stay due to a letter of protection. Then, on 7 April 1946, he was informed by the Soviet military authorities that the Polish government was insisting on his resettlement. Before his expulsion, he became very ill.

===Death===

At the beginning of May 1946, Hauptmann learned that the Polish government was insisting on the expulsion of all Germans without exception. On 6 June, he died of bronchitis in Agnieszków (present-day Jagniątków, a part of &quot;Hirschberg im Riesengebirge&quot;, now Jelenia Góra). His last words were reported to be, &quot;Am I still in my house?&quot; Despite his final wishes, as expressed in his last will, Hauptmann was not buried at his home.

An official letter from the Soviet Administration in favor of the writer, who was highly regarded in the Soviet Union, proved ineffective, though the family was permitted to take its belongings. Only an hour after his death, the local militia had gathered outside the window directly under his deathbed and banging pots and pans and blowing whistles and trumpets.

==Funeral==

At a funeral service held in Stralsund, near Hauptmann&#x27;s summer home on Hiddensee island, Wilhelm Pieck, then co-chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany spoke, along with poet Johannes R. Becher, and Soviet official Sergei Ivanovich Tiulpanov all spoke.

On the morning of 28 July, 52 days after his death, he was buried before sunrise at the cemetery in Hiddensee. His widow mixed a small sack of earth from the Riesengebirge/Karkonosze Mountains (Krkonoše) in Silesia with the sandy soil of the Baltic coast where he was buried. In 1951, a granite block was unveiled as the grave stone. It bears, as per Hauptmann&#x27;s wish, only his name. In 1983, his wife Margarete&#x27;s remains were moved to lie beside her husband&#x27;s, though she had died in 1957.

==Work==
===Influences===
Hauptmann first encountered the various representatives of the naturalist movement through the avant-garde society &quot;Durch&quot; in 1885, which was an important influence. The society hearkened back to historical examples from the Sturm und Drang movement, especially the circle centered on the Hart Brothers up until the Vormärz period before the revolutions of 1848.

At their meetings, aesthetic questions about idealism, Realism and the naturalist movement were discussed. Hauptmann gave a lecture about the theretofore largely forgotten poet and dramatist Georg Büchner. With that, he also established his naturalistic orientation.

At the end of the 1880s, he was confronted with the incipient anti-socialist movement. The first of the Anti-Socialist Laws was passed in 1878 and strengthened in 1887. Hauptmann was in 1887 called before the court in Breslau, because he had been a follower of the &quot;Icharians,&quot; whose ideas hearkened back to the ideas of French communist Etienne Cabet.

He sought refuge in his brother&#x27;s house in Zurich in order to avoid prosecution. While there he encountered psychiatrist August Forel and the preacher Johannes Guttzeit, whose ideas influenced &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;. Hauptmann&#x27;s early dream of a utopian-socialist community were further fed by his encounter with the poet Gusto Gräser, whose communal colony Hauptmann would visit several times in 1919. The story &quot;The Heretic of Soana&quot;, the novel &quot;The Fool in Christ Emmanuel Quint&quot;, and the final chapter of &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; deal with his experience of a Dionysian-Jesuanic itinerant prophet.

===Naturalism===
Hauptmann began producing naturalistic works in Zurich. From there, he sent the manuscript of &quot;Bahnwärter Thiel&quot;, his first naturalistic work, to Munich to be read by the critic Michael Georg Conrad. Hauptmann&#x27;s 1889 play &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; caused one of the largest scandals in German theater history. The bourgeois audience was shocked by the frank depictions of alcoholism and sexuality.

According to Franz-Josef Payrhuber, &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; was an epoch-making work, but it is not the representative example of naturalistic drama, that label would go to &quot;Die Familie Selicke&quot; by Arno Holz and Johannes Schlaf. Hauptmann however did have an important role, with the support of Otto Brahm, in establishing naturalistic drama on the German stage. Theaters under Brahm&#x27;s leadership premiered 17 of Hauptmann&#x27;s plays. Those plays, and the numerous performances across Germany, gave Naturalism its first broad exposure and social impact.

With his most important play, &quot;The Weavers&quot;, which he had already been contemplating during his stay in Zurich, Hauptmann achieved world renown and reached the high point of his Naturalistic phase.

===Critical reception===
Hauptmann&#x27;s early work received differing reviews. Conservative circles and also the government were not excited about his socially critical dramas, which made itself felt through censorship. His position in the opposition raised his profile in progressive, intellectual circles, which appreciated these aspects of his work. After many naturalistic-influenced works, Hauptmann&#x27;s style changed and he grew increasingly well-received among the educated and upper classes.

Nevertheless, he was still in demand as a writer and was regarded abroad as the representative poet of Germany. The Hungarian philosopher and literature critic, Georg Lukacs later called Hauptmann the &quot;representative poet of bourgeois Germany,&quot; by which he did not mean to underscore Hauptmann&#x27;s prominent position. Rather, he expressed displeasure with Hauptmann&#x27;s fickleness and lack of attachment to his &quot;revolutionary beginnings.&quot; Despite his preeminence, the sale of his works steadily declined as other poets and playwrights took the spotlight.

Hauptmann had taken up a lavish lifestyle, lived in expensive hotels, often received guests, and took trips to Italy. He summered in his large house on the Hiddensee, that Günter Kunert called a &quot;do-it-yourself Olympia.&quot; Thomas Mann referred to this lavish lifestyle when he called him in 1922 the &quot;King of the Republic.&quot; Mann met Hauptmann at an Alpine resort and wrote to his brother, &quot;I hobnob every evening with Hauptmann, who is a really good fellow.&quot; In addition Mann adapted some of Hauptmann&#x27;s traits for his character Mynheer Peeperkorn in his book &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;.

When Hauptmann continued to live in Germany after the Nazis came to power, they attempted to use Hauptmann for their own purposes. Various works that displeased the party leaders were banned but others continued to be performed. At his 80th birthday, in 1942 he was honored by the government with a festival and tributes, which he accepted. Hauptmann&#x27;s ebb-and-flow character was highlighted in William L. Shirer&#x27;s &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;. Shirer offered in a first-person account:

After his death, the fame he had enjoyed in life began to fade. His reputation was further diminished by his uncritical attitude toward the Nazis. Nevertheless, centenary celebrations were held in many German cities in 1962, and his works continued to be performed on West German stages into the 1970s, especially &quot;Der Biberpelz&quot; and &quot;Die Ratten&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, security (engineering) protocol notation, also known as protocol narrations and Alice &amp; Bob notation, is a way of expressing a protocol of correspondence between entities of a dynamic system, such as a computer network. In the context of a formal model, it allows reasoning about the properties of such a system.

The standard notation consists of a set of principals (traditionally named Alice, Bob, Charlie, and so on) who wish to communicate. They may have access to a server S, shared keys K, timestamps T, and can generate nonces N for authentication purposes.

A simple example might be the following:

:formula_1

This states that Alice intends a message for Bob consisting of a plaintext X encrypted under shared key KA,B.

Another example might be the following:

:formula_2

This states that Bob intends a message for Alice consisting of a [[Security protocol notation|n]]once NB encrypted using public key of Alice.

A key with two subscripts, KA,B, is a symmetric key shared by the two corresponding individuals. A key with one subscript, KA, is the public key of the corresponding individual. A private key is represented as the inverse of the public key.

The notation specifies only the operation and not its semantics — for instance, private key encryption and signature are represented identically.

We can express more complicated protocols in such a fashion. See Kerberos as an example. Some sources refer to this notation as &quot;Kerberos Notation&quot;. Some authors consider the notation used by Steiner, Neuman, &amp; Schiller as a notable reference.

Several models exist to reason about security protocols in this way, one of which is BAN logic.

Security protocol notation inspired many of the programming languages used in choreographic programming.

<text>John Shaw (177317 September 1823) was an Irish-born American officer in the United States Navy.

==Personal life==
A third-generation Anglo-Irishman, John Shaw&#x27;s father and father&#x27;s father were both officers of the British Armed Forces. The family of his mother—Elizabeth Barton—were also English emigrants to Ireland. John Shaw himself was born in Mountmellick, Kingdom of Ireland in 1773. In 1790, 17-year-old Shaw and his brother left Ireland for the fledgling United States, arriving in New York City before heading to the nation&#x27;s capitol of Philadelphia.

On 9 August 1798, Shaw married the Philadelphia Quaker, Elizabeth Palmer, with whom he had two surviving daughters: Elizabeth Shaw married Francis Gregory and had seven children; her younger sister Virginia married William F. Lynch and bore two children. After the death of Elizabeth, Shaw wedded Mary Breed of Charleston, Massachusetts in her hometown on 13 October 1820. Shaw died from illness in Philadelphia on 17 September 1823 at the age of 50.

==Pre-Naval work==
Having discovered a taste for life on the ocean, Shaw sailed from the US in 1791 and worked aboard ships, making four round-trips to Guangdong through 1797. During his second trip to Qing-ruled China, Shaw was on aboard the ship &quot;Sampson&quot; when it repelled an attack by British Malayan proas in the Bangka Strait; on his third voyage, he served as third officer, and by his fourth excursion to East Asia, Shaw was his ship&#x27;s first officer.

Shaw was one of several-hundred members of the Macpherson&#x27;s Blues irregular military; Shaw was a Blues private in the 1794 suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion, and didn&#x27;t return to Philadelphia until the end of the year.

==Naval sailing==
===Quasi-War===
In late 1797, Shaw was the sailing master of a brig that traveled to the West Indies and returned to the States in spring 1798, having been harassed by French Naval ships in the lead-up to the Quasi-War. Having suffered these, and with the support of Brigadier General Samuel Smith, the 25-year-old Shaw applied for a commission with the nascent United States Navy. Shaw was appointed a lieutenant on 3 August 1798, and his first assignment was , patrolling the West Indies from November 1798 through October 1799 under Alexander Murray. On 20 October 1799, was placed under his command.

The schooner &quot;Victory&quot; was laden with &quot;valuable cargo from Norfolk&quot;, and had been sailing under the French flag for five days when Shaw recaptured the ship for the United States. Two days later he recaptured the brig &quot;Androscoggin&quot;, which had been under French control for six days. In spring 1800, Lieutenant Shaw sparred with an Imperial Spanish brig, captured two French privateers (&quot;Citoyenne&quot; and the schooner &quot;Seine&quot;), and a French Naval lugger carrying a divisional general of the French Army. On his own initiative, Shaw traded the French general for two American mariners held prisoner in Puerto Rico. Mid-1800 saw Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot; capture: the French brig &quot;Flambeau&quot;; the French privateers &quot;l&#x27;Aigle&quot;, &quot;Cygne&quot;, and &quot;Pauline&quot; (the latter carrying the French consul to Puerto Rico); the French letter-of-marque &quot;Guadaloupéenne&quot; with the same French divisional general as had been captured that spring; and eleven further captured American ships.

Unwell, Shaw heeded his medics in autumn and requested to be relieved of command to seek treatment. After his replacement by Andrew Sterett, Shaw returned to the US aboard in November 1800. Shaw&#x27;s one-year tenure as &quot;Enterprise&quot; skipper made the schooner &quot;one of the famous vessels of the Navy&quot;; the two together captured more French privateers than any other American ship in the West Indies. The following January, he was personally thanked for his service by US President John Adams and Secretary of War Samuel Dexter. Shaw was promised command of the captured French corvette, &quot;Berceau&quot;, but was brought up short when the Convention of 1800 ended the conflict, and &quot;Berceau&quot; was repatriated to the French First Republic. With the end of hostilities, Shaw&#x27;s exceptional service commanding &quot;Enterprise&quot; kept him in the service at his then-current rank, even in the face of 70–75% reductions in Naval manning.

===1801–1811===
Taking command of on 4 May 1801, Shaw sailed the vessel to deliver tribute to Algiers, and repatriated Americans who had been captured by the deys there. When he returned to the US after his tour abroad, new laws reduced his monthly pay to . Taking a furlough from the US Navy, Shaw mastered an East Indiaman for 18 months: from the US to Isle de France to Guangdong and back to the US. When he returned to the Navy in September 1804, pursuant a new 22-May law, Shaw was promoted to master commandant. The following May, Shaw was given to serve US interests in the First Barbary War, but he arrived after the declaration of peace; Shaw returned &quot;Adams&quot; to Washington, D.C. in December 1805.

Shaw was assigned to New Orleans in January 1806, instructed to commission a gunboat flotilla to patrol the Gulf of Mexico. Before the year&#x27;s end, Shaw learned of the Burr conspiracy, and pushed for the construction of more gunboats—to stand against Burr&#x27;s revolution, should it come to pass—without instruction to do so. In February 1807 at Natchez, Mississippi, Shaw mustered 61 guns, 448 US Military men, and the ketches &quot;Ætna&quot; and &quot;Vesuvius&quot; to capture the former vice president of the United States (VP). After Burr&#x27;s capture, Shaw testified against him in Richmond, Virginia.

In the aftermath of the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair, Shaw sat on the court-martial of Commodore James Barron. On 27 August 1807, Shaw was promoted to captain, and from March 1808 to July 1810, he served at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.

On 7 July 1810, Shaw was made commander of the New Orleans naval station—an assignment that was &quot;proof of the Department&#x27;s confidence, as he had given satisfaction when there before, and was very acceptable to the inhabitants.&quot; This assignment placed Captain Shaw under Major General James Wilkinson, the commander of all United States Armed Forces in the Louisiana Purchase since 1803. Wilkinson had been part of the Burr conspiracy before betraying the former VP, and though repeatedly acquitted, Shaw disliked serving under the man; his protestations to the Navy Department earned him naught but an order to cooperate with the senior Army officer. Before the 1812 outbreak of war with Great Britain, Shaw assisted in suppressing an &quot;insurrection of the blacks.&quot;

===War of 1812===
When the War of 1812 broke out with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, of the 14 gunboats vital to the defense of New Orleans, Shaw only had ten operational. Also under his command were the brigs , , and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;; Shaw also purchased the commercial vessel &quot;Remittance&quot; on behalf of the Navy to become , a ship in poor condition that nonetheless met muster at the Battle of New Orleans.

While combat eschewed the Gulf until the war&#x27;s waning years, and Shaw worked to prepare coastal defenses (including a blockship), he also had to contend with &quot;extensive&quot; piracy and smuggling on his coast.  Pirate ships were duplicitously flying the flags of the newly independent United Provinces of New Granada and Captaincy General of Venezuela, and illegal attacks on Spanish ships were coming from a pirate base in Louisiana&#x27;s Barataria Bay. In March 1813, Shaw commanded the naval component of General Wilkinson&#x27;s seizure of the Imperial Spanish city of Mobile. When he left in October 1813, Shaw was succeeded at New Orleans by his second-in-command, Daniel Patterson.
In spring 1814, Shaw was given command of a squadron of blockaded ships (, USS &quot;Macedonian&quot;, and ) in Connecticut&#x27;s Thames River; &quot;Hornet&quot; escaped and captured , but Shaw&#x27;s &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;Macedonian&quot; remained stuck until March 1815.

===1815–1823===
With the declaration of the Second Barbary War, Shaw captained &quot;United States&quot; and left for Algiers. When he arrived at Málaga in September 1815 with Commodore William Bainbridge, the conflict was already over. Bainbridge therefore took the bulk of US Naval forces back to the states, leaving Shaw in command of the US Naval assets in the Mediterranean: &quot;United States&quot;, , , , and . When he was relieved by Commodore Isaac Chauncey in autumn 1816, Shaw remained in-theater until the following November when he left for the US commanding &quot;Constellation&quot;, which was in need of repair; Shaw arrived at Hampton Roads on 26 December 1817, ending his deployment after 28 months.
In April 1818, Shaw was placed in charge of the Naval Station Norfolk through the following July when he stepped down on account of poor health. Shaw took command of on 2 October 1819, and captained that ship based out of Boston Harbor for over two years. Excepting his 20 March20 September suspension by court-martial for &quot;unofficer like conduct&quot;, Shaw remained in Greater Boston until requesting transfer to a warmer climate on 26 May 1823. On 23 August, he was offered command of Charleston Navy Yard, &quot;a station rather of honor, however, than of active duty.&quot; Shaw accepted the assignment on 26 August, but died 22 days later in Philadelphia.

===Legacy===
The first US Naval ship named for Shaw was , commissioned on 9 April 1917 with Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Milton S. Davis in command. The second was , commissioned on 18 September 1936 with LCDR E. A. Mitchell in command.

<doc id="230780" wikidata="Q10531" url="?curid=230780" title="Luther Blissett">
<text>Luther Loide Blissett (born 1 February 1958) is a former professional footballer and manager who played for the England national team during the 1980s. Born in Jamaica, Blissett played as a striker, and is best known for his time at Watford, whom he helped win promotion from the Fourth Division to the First Division. As of 2022, Blissett holds Watford&#x27;s all-time records for appearances and goals, having played 503 games and scored 186 goals.

Blissett&#x27;s other clubs included A.C. Milan, who paid £1m for him in 1983 before selling him back to Watford for £550,000 in 1984, and AFC Bournemouth, for whom he had a goals-to-games ratio of nearly one goal in every two appearances. Blissett was capped 14 times by England, scoring a hat-trick on his debut. After retiring from playing, Blissett turned to coaching, initially under the management of Graham Taylor at Watford, and managed Chesham United from 2006 until 2007.

Since the mid-1990s, Luther Blissett has frequently been used as a pseudonym, most notably by members of the Luther Blissett Project.

==Club career==

===Watford===
Born in Falmouth, Jamaica, Blissett began his career with Watford as an apprentice on leaving school in the summer of 1974. He turned professional for the 1975–76 season, making three appearances in the Football League Fourth Division and scoring one goal. Four goalless appearances came in the 1976–77 season, before he broke into the first team under new manager Graham Taylor in 1977–78, when his six goals in 33 games helped Watford win promotion to the Football League Third Division. 21 goals the following campaign played a big part in a second successive promotion which took them into the Football League Second Division. He remained among the club&#x27;s top goalscorers over the next three seasons as Watford consolidated in the Second Division and finally reached the First Division for the first time in their history in 1982, at the end of a season in which Blissett scored 19 league goals.

Blissett and his teammates made the headlines in the 1982–83 season as they surprised many by proving successful in the First Division. Watford briefly led the league in the autumn, before finishing second to Liverpool and qualified for the UEFA Cup. In Watford&#x27;s first ever First Division season, Blissett was the division&#x27;s top goalscorer that season with 27 goals.

===A.C. Milan===
He subsequently moved to A.C. Milan for £1 million in June 1983, but he was not as successful as he had been in England, scoring only five goals in 30 appearances. It has since been rumoured that A.C. Milan confused him with his Watford teammate John Barnes. However Italian football journalist Gabriele Marcotti believes this story is untrue. &quot;There are two main reason for which I think it&#x27;s not true,&quot; he says. &quot;First, even the most ignorant and provincial person could see that Blissett and Barnes looked absolutely nothing alike. Second, the fact is that at that time Milan were looking for an out-and-out goalscorer and Barnes just wasn&#x27;t that type of player.&quot; &quot;No matter how much money you have here&quot;, Blissett famously complained about Italy, &quot;you can&#x27;t seem to get Rice Krispies,&quot; though he later claimed this was a joking response to what he considered a stupid question from a journalist.

===Return to Watford===
Blissett was sold back to Watford for £550,000 after one season with AC Milan. In his absence, Watford had reached their first FA Cup final, but lost to Everton, while new signing Mo Johnston was top scorer with 20 goals in the First Division.

On Blissett&#x27;s return, Watford failed to achieve their successes of the previous two seasons, but survived another four seasons in the First Division. Blissett scored 21 goals in his first season back in the First Division, though the Hornets could only manage a mid table finish. He also helped them reach the FA Cup semi finals in 1986–87, but a year later they were relegated with Blissett scoring just four times in the league. He remained with the club until November 1988, when he signed for AFC Bournemouth.

===Bournemouth===
Blissett was successful at Dean Court, scoring 19 times from 30 league games in 1988–89 as the Cherries finished 10th in the Second Division, after emerging as surprise promotion contenders in only their second season at that level. He scored 18 goals in 1989–90, though a slump in the second half of the season dragged the Cherries down the table and on the last day of the season they were beaten at home by Leeds United in a result which gave the visitor&#x27;s promotion as Second Division champions and relegated the Cherries to the Third Division. Undeterred, Blissett continued his fine form for Harry Redknapp&#x27;s team, scoring 19 goals, though it wasn&#x27;t enough to earn promotion at the end of the 1990–91 campaign.

===Third spell at Watford===
Blissett returned to Watford for a third spell at the start of the 1991–92 season. They were still in the Second Division, and his 10 goals in the league that season were not enough for Watford to look like promotion contenders, meaning that they would be founder members of the rebranded Division One – rather than the new FA Premier League – for the 1992–93 season. Blissett never played a first team game for Watford again, his only action in 1992–93 coming in shape of a three-match loan spell at West Bromwich Albion, which resulted in one Division Two goal.

===Lower leagues===
He ended his English league career in late 1993 with a five-match spell with Division Three club Mansfield Town (where he scored once) that had followed 10 games club Bury. After that came a five-match spell in the Football Conference at Southport, producing two goals, and four games and a goal for Derry City in the League of Ireland, before he finally retired from playing in 1995 after a season playing for Fakenham Town in the Eastern Counties Football League.

==International career==
Although born in Jamaica, Blissett was eligible to play for England having moved to the country at a young age. After making four appearances for England under-21s, Blissett became one of the first black footballers to play for the senior team. He scored a hat-trick on his full international debut – a 9–0 win over Luxembourg, in doing so becoming the first black player ever to score for England. He never scored in any other international, however, despite playing for England a further 13 times.

==Coaching career==
He rejoined Watford as a coach in February 1996, coming in with returning manager Graham Taylor. He left the club in June 2001, following the appointment of Gianluca Vialli as manager. Vialli wanted to appoint his own backroom staff, and Blissett was among those deemed surplus to requirements. Taylor was publicly critical of the decision not to retain long-serving members of staff such as Blissett and Kenny Jackett.

In May 2002, he moved to York City to carry out a coaching role. He later left that post and on 15 February 2006 was appointed manager of Southern League team Chesham United, which he even made two appearances for as a substitute. However, in April 2007, it was announced that Blissett would leave Chesham at the end of the season to concentrate on his involvement with the Windrush Motorsport project, which aimed to enter the Le Mans 24-hour race.

On 27 March 2010, it was confirmed that Blissett had signed to Hemel Hempstead Town as a coach.

In the summer of 2016, Blissett was appointed Director of Football at Burnham, briefly serving as caretaker after the departures of both Dave Tuttle and Gifton Noel-Williams.

==Personal life and cultural impact==
Blissett has worked as a television pundit for Channel 4 and Bravo&#x27;s coverage of Serie A.

With fellow former Watford and England footballers John Barnes and Les Ferdinand, he founded Team48 Motorsport; a team aiming to promote young racing drivers of Afro-Caribbean background. In 2008, Blissett entered a team into the British Touring Car Championship, aiming to run Alfa Romeos for white Jamaican Matthew Gore and 18-year-old black Briton Darelle Wilson. However, the project never got off the starting line and the team failed to show up for any of the races.

Soccer AM, a football magazine programme on Sky Sports, refers to the area where &#x27;fans of the week&#x27; sit as the &#x27;Luther Blissett Stand&#x27;.

In 2011, Blissett took part in a celebrity motor race at the 2011 Silverstone Classic. He had a large crash on the opening lap, rolling the car several times. He was unhurt. Rick Parfitt Jnr won the race, with Heston Blumenthal second and Brendan Cole third. They were all raising money for the Bobby Moore fund for Cancer Research. From 2014, Blissett was racing an Alfa 156 in the BRSCC Alfashop Alfa Romeo Championship.

Blissett was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to association football and charity.

==Blissett and the &quot;Luther Blissett Project&quot;==

Blissett&#x27;s name has been adopted by many people in radical activist circles as a &quot;nom de plume&quot; or collective alias when engaged in unusual performances, situationist pranks, media hoaxes, and the production of radical theory. The Luther Blissett multiple name project first began in 1994 in Italy, no doubt a consequence of his link with A.C. Milan, and has since then been widely used by artists, underground reviews, poets, performers and squatters&#x27; collectives in cities throughout Europe and South America. In 1999 &quot;Luther Blissett&quot; authored a historical novel called Q, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies in over ten languages.

On 30 June 2004, the real Luther Blissett took part in the British television sports show &quot;Fantasy Football League – Euro 2004&quot;, broadcast on ITV. He jokingly claimed that he himself was part of the Luther Blissett Project, and read aloud the following sentence from an LBP manifesto (in Italian): &quot;Chiunque può essere Luther Blissett, semplicemente adottando il nome Luther Blissett&quot; [Anyone can be Luther Blissett simply by adopting the name Luther Blissett].

<text>The Irish state came into being in 1919 as the 32 county Irish Republic. In 1922, having seceded from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty, it became the Irish Free State. It comprised 26 counties with 6 counties under the control of Unionists which became Northern Ireland in 1921. Bunreacht na hÉireann 1937 constitution renamed the 26 states &#x27;Ireland&#x27;. In 1949, only 26 counties explicitly became a republic under the terms of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, definitively ending its tenuous membership of the British Commonwealth. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the European Communities (EC) as a member state which would later become the European Union (EU).

Upon its foundation, the Irish Free State was embroiled in a civil war between nationalists supporting the Treaty and opponents who supported the existing Republic. The pro-Treaty side, organised as Cumann na nGaedheal, emerged victorious from the conflict and won subsequent elections. They formed the government of the state until 1932, when they peacefully handed over power to the anti-Treaty faction in Fianna Fáil, who defeated them in an election. The Irish state, despite its violent beginnings, has remained a democracy throughout its existence. Changes in the 1930s removed many of the links with Britain established under the Treaty and Ireland&#x27;s neutrality in the Second World War demonstrated its independence in foreign policy matters from Britain.

In the economic sphere, the Irish state has had a mixed performance. On independence, it was one of the wealthier countries in Europe per head of population. However it also inherited from British rule the problems of unemployment, emigration, uneven geographical development and lack of a native industrial base. For much of its history, the state struggled to rectify these problems. Particular peaks of emigration were recorded during the 1930s, 1950s and 1980s, when the Irish economy recorded little growth.

In the 1930s, Fianna Fáil governments attempted to create Irish domestic industries using subsidies and protective tariffs. In the late 1950s, these policies were dropped in favour of free trade with selected countries and encouraging of foreign investment with low taxes. This was expanded when Ireland entered the European Economic Community in 1973. In the 1990s and 2000s, Ireland experienced an economic boom known as the Celtic Tiger, in which the country&#x27;s GDP surpassed many of its European neighbours. Immigration also surpassed emigration, bringing the state&#x27;s population up to over 4 million. However, since 2008, Ireland has experienced a severe crisis in the banking sector and with sovereign debt. The resultant economic slump has deepened the effect of the world recession on Ireland till 2012. Since 2012 unemployment rates and the economy has grown except around Covid. In the global GDP per capita tables, Ireland ranks 4th of 186 in the IMF table and 4th of 187 in the World Bank ranking.

From 1937 to 1998, the Irish constitution included an irredentist claim on Northern Ireland as a part of the national territory. However, the state also opposed and used its security forces against those armed groups – principally the Provisional Irish Republican Army – who tried to unite Ireland by force. This occurred in the 1950s, throughout the 1970s and 1980s and has continued on a reduced scale. Irish governments meanwhile tried to broker an agreement to the conflict known as the Troubles within Northern Ireland from 1968 to the late 1990s. The British government officially recognised the right of the Irish government to be a party to the Northern negotiations in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985. In 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish constitution was altered by referendum to remove the territorial claim to Northern Ireland and instead extend the right of Irish citizenship to all the people of the island should they wish to have it.

==Background to independence==

===Separatism, rebellion and partition===

From Union in 1801 until 6 December 1922 the whole of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. However, from the 1880s, there had been long-standing nationalist agitation for autonomy or Home Rule. Other, more radical voices such as the Irish Republican Brotherhood called for independence, but these were in a minority.

In 1912–1913, the Liberal government in Britain proposed a Bill for Home Rule. Alarmed, unionists in the north organized the Ulster Volunteers, an armed militia proposing to resist Home Rule by force. Nationalists in response founded the Irish Volunteers. Arising out of this stand off, the partition of Ireland was proposed in three way talks between the Irish Parliamentary Party, the Unionist Party and the British government. In 1914, the UK Parliament enacted a Third Irish Home Rule Bill but suspended its effect until after World War I.

The nationalist leader John Redmond pledged support for the British war effort and many Irishmen served in the British Army (see Ireland and World War I), but the war and the frustration of nationalist ambitions regarding Home Rule led to a radicalisation of Irish nationalism. In 1916, a group of IRB activists within the Irish Volunteers led an insurrection aimed at Irish independence in Dublin, known as the Easter Rising. The rebellion did not have popular support and was put down within a week, but the execution of its leaders, and the subsequent wholesale arrest of radical nationalist activists proved very unpopular with the nationalist public. Coming directly after the Rising, a further attempt was made at the Irish Convention to resolve the impasse over Home Rule, but without success. Finally, the British proposal to extend conscription for the war to Ireland provoked widespread resistance, (see Conscription Crisis of 1918) and discredited the Irish Parliamentary Party who had supported the British war effort.

All of these factors led to a swing towards support for Sinn Féin – the party which was led by veterans of the Easter Rising and which stood for an independent Irish Republic. In the 1918 Irish general election, Sinn Féin won the vast majority of seats, many of which were uncontested. Sinn Féin&#x27;s elected candidates refused to attend the UK Parliament at Westminster and instead assembled in Dublin as a new revolutionary parliament called &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot;. They declared the existence of a new state called the &quot;Irish Republic&quot; and established a system of government to rival the institutions of the United Kingdom.

The first meeting of the Dáil coincided with an unauthorised shooting of two RIC men in Tipperary, now regarded as the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence. From 1919 to 1921 the Irish Volunteers (now renamed as the Irish Republican Army, being deemed by the Dáil to be the army of the new Irish Republic) engaged in guerrilla warfare against the British army, the RIC and paramilitary police units known as the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries. The violence started out slowly, with only 19 deaths in 1919, but escalated sharply from the second half of 1920 and in the first six months of 1921 alone there were 1,000 deaths on all sides. The principle political leader of the republican movement was Éamon de Valera – the President of the Republic. However he spent much of the conflict in the United States, raising money and support for the Irish cause. In his absence, two young men, Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy rose to prominence as the clandestine leaders of the IRA – respectively Director of Intelligence and Chief of Staff of the guerrilla organisation.

There were several failed attempts to negotiate an end to the conflict. In the summer of 1920, the British government proposed the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (which passed into law on 3 May 1921) that envisaged the partition of the island of Ireland into two autonomous regions &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; (six northeastern counties) and &quot;Southern Ireland&quot; (the rest of the island, including its most northerly county, Donegal). However, this was not acceptable to southern republicans and only the entity of Northern Ireland was established under the Act in 1921. The political entity of Southern Ireland was superseded in 1922 by the creation of the Irish Free State.

After further failed talks in December 1920, the guerrilla conflict was brought to an end in July 1921, with a truce agreed between the IRA and the British. Talks were then formally begun in pursuit of a peace settlement.

To some extent, the War of Independence exposed political and religious fissures in Irish society. The IRA killed over 200 civilians as alleged informers in the conflict. It has been alleged that groups like Protestants and ex-servicemen were disproportionately represented in this figure – an argument disputed by other historians. However whether due to violence and intimidation or due to their loyalty to the British presence in Ireland, between 1911 and 1926 some 34 percent of the Free State&#x27;s Protestant population – or about 40,000 people – left the 26 counties, mostly for Northern Ireland or Great Britain. While there were many reasons for this, secession from the United Kingdom was a factor in Protestant emigration.

===Anglo-Irish Treaty===

Negotiations between the British and Irish negotiating teams produced the Anglo-Irish Treaty, concluded on 6 December 1921. The Irish team was led by Michael Collins, who had organised the IRA intelligence during the War of Independence. The British team led by David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were prepared to make concessions on Irish independence but would not concede a republic. Towards the end of negotiations, Lloyd George threatened, &quot;immediate and terrible war&quot; if the Irish did not accept the terms offered.

The Treaty envisaged a new system of Irish self-government, known as &quot;dominion status&quot;, with a new state, to be called the Irish Free State. The Free State was considerably more independent than a Home Rule Parliament would have been. It had its own police and armed forces and control over its own taxation and fiscal policy, none of which had been envisaged under Home Rule. However, there were some limits to its sovereignty. It remained a dominion of the British Commonwealth and members of its parliament had to swear an oath of loyalty to the British monarch. The British also retained three naval bases, known as the Treaty Ports. In addition, the Irish state was obliged to honour the contracts of the existing civil service—with the exception of the Royal Irish Constabulary, which was disbanded, albeit with full pensions—payable by the Irish state.

There was also the question of partition, which pre-dated the Treaty but which was copper-fastened by it. In theory, Northern Ireland was included under the terms of the Treaty but under Article 12 was, given the option to opt out within a month. (See Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922) Thus for three days from midnight on 6 December 1922 the newly established Irish Free State, in theory included all of the island of Ireland (including Northern Ireland). However, in practice, Northern Ireland was already a functioning autonomous area by this time and it formally left the Irish Free State on 8 December 1922.

As a result of these limits to the Free State&#x27;s sovereignty, and because the Treaty dismantled the Republic declared by nationalists in 1918, the Sinn Féin movement, the Dáil and the IRA were all deeply split over whether to accept the Treaty. Éamon de Valera, the President of the Republic was the most prominent leader of those who rejected the Treaty. Among other things, he objected to the fact that Collins and the negotiating team had signed it without the authorisation of the Dáil Cabinet.

===Civil War===

On a vote of 64 to 57, the Dáil narrowly passed the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 7 January 1922. Éamon de Valera, President of the Republic and several other cabinet members resigned in protest.
The pro-Treaty leadership of Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, organised in a Provisional Government, set about establishing the Irish Free State created by the Treaty. To this end, they began recruiting for a new army, based initially at Beggars Bush Barracks in Dublin, composed of pro-Treaty IRA units. They also began recruiting for a new police, the Civic Guard, to replace the RIC which was disbanded as of August 1922.

However a majority of the IRA led by Rory O&#x27;Connor opposed the Treaty, on the grounds that it disestablished the Irish republic, which they argued they were sworn to defend, and that it imposed a declaration of fidelity to the British monarch on Irish parliamentarians. The IRA held a convention in March 1922, in which they renounced their allegiance to the Dáil and vested it in their own Army Council. O&#x27;Connor in April led the occupation by anti-Treaty forces of several public buildings in Dublin, notably the Four Courts – centre of the Irish legal system. Éamon de Valera, while not in command of the anti-Treaty IRA, also led political opposition to the Treaty in a new party named Cumann na Poblachta.

With two rival Irish armed forces now in the country, civil war looked likely from the spring of 1922. Three events set it off. The first was the election of 18 June 1922, which the pro-Treaty Sinn Féin party won, giving the Free State a popular mandate. The second was the assassination by Irish republicans in London of a retired British general Henry Hughes Wilson. While it is not clear who ordered the killing, the British government assumed it was the anti-Treaty IRA and ordered Collins to act against them or risk armed British intervention to do it. The third trigger was the kidnapping by the IRA in the Four Courts of Free State general, JJ &quot;Ginger&quot; O&#x27;Connell. This combination of events forced the Collins government to assault and take the anti-Treaty positions in Dublin, which it succeeded in doing after a week&#x27;s fighting in July 1922. Éamon de Valera declared his support for the anti-Treaty IRA after the outbreak of hostilities.

A further military offensive secured the Free State control over the other major towns and cities in its territory by the beginning of August. Despite their defeat in open warfare, the IRA regrouped and took up a guerrilla campaign, as they saw it, to restore the Irish Republic. The war dragged on in a guerrilla form until April 1923. In August 1922, the Free State was rocked by the death of its two main leaders. Michael Collins was killed in an ambush at Béal na mBláth, Cork, on 22 August 1922 and Arthur Griffith died of a stroke a week earlier. W. T. Cosgrave assumed control of both the Irish Republic&#x27;s cabinet and the Provisional Government and both administrations disappeared simultaneously shortly afterwards, replaced by the institutions of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922.

The anti-Treaty IRA under Liam Lynch tried to use the same guerrilla tactics against the Free State as they had against the British in 1919–1921. However, without the same degree of popular support, they were less effective. By late 1922, the Irish National Army had taken all the major towns in the country and reduced the IRA&#x27;s campaign to small scale attacks. A very large number of anti-Treaty fighters, some 12,000 in all, were interned by the Free State. Moreover, as it went on the war produced acts of great cruelty on both sides. The Free State embarked on a policy of selective executions – 77 prisoners were judicially shot with over 100 more &#x27;unofficially&#x27; killed in the field. The anti-Treaty forces assassinated one pro-Treaty member of Parliament, and several other civilian politicians, wounded more and burned their houses. However the Free State&#x27;s tactics of internment and executions combined to cripple the anti-Treaty forces by April 1923.

The death in action of Liam Lynch in this month led to the anti-Treaty IRA, under the orders of Frank Aiken and on the urgings of civilian leader de Valera, calling a ceasefire and to &quot;dump arms&quot;. There was no negotiated end to the war however.

The Civil War between Irish nationalists created a great deal of bitterness and the Civil War cleavage also produced the two main parties of independent Ireland in the 20th century. The number of dead has yet to be accurately counted but is considered to be around 2,000; at least as high as the number killed in the preceding War of Independence.

==The Irish state, 1922–1939==

Immediately after the Civil War, elections were held in which anti-Treaty Sinn Féin were allowed to participate. Although many of their candidates, including Éamon de Valera, were imprisoned, they won about one third of the vote. However the pro-Treaty side, organised in Cumann na nGaedheal, won a comfortable majority and went on to form the government of the new state until 1932.

The Cumann na nGaedheal governments, led by WT Cosgrave, were highly conservative – being more concerned with establishing the state&#x27;s basic institutions after the havoc of the Civil War than with social or political reform. According to Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, the Minister for Justice, &quot;we were the most conservative group of revolutionaries ever to have carried out a successful revolution&quot;.

The Irish Civil Service was largely inherited intact from the British and senior civil servants such as C.J. Gregg were &#x27;lent&#x27; to the Irish from London to get the new state&#x27;s bureaucracy off the ground. The new service, and especially its comptroller, Joseph Brennan were initially most concerned with balancing the state&#x27;s budget and avoiding long-term in-debtedness The Free State printed its own notes (the punt), and minted its own coins but their value remained tied to British sterling currency until the 1970s.

Whereas the British had devolved much power to local government in the 1890s, one of the Free State&#x27;s first acts was to abolish many of the powers of County Councils and replace them with unelected County managers. This was partly due to the allegiance of some councils to the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War, but also due to the belief that giving power to local government bred corruption. One of the major successes of the Cumann na nGaedheal governments was to establish the police, the Garda Síochána, as an unarmed and politically neutral force, relatively untainted by the bitterness of the civil war.

On the economic front, the Cosgrave administration saw its role as supporting the Irish agricultural export sector by consolidating farms and improving the quality of their produce. Ernest Blythe, the first Minister for Finance, in a bid to reduce the public debt, cut public expenditure from £42 million in 1923 to £27 million in 1926. The Cumann na nGeadhael governments did not see providing social services as a priority and instead cut income tax from 5 to 3 shillings. One exception to the generally low level of public spending was the Shannon hydroelectric scheme, which provided Ireland&#x27;s first autonomous source of electricity.

While the last prisoners of the Civil War were released in 1924, the Free State retained extensive emergency powers to intern and even execute political opponents, under a series of Public Safety Acts (1923, 1926 and 1931). These powers were used after the IRA assassinated Minister Kevin O&#x27;Higgins (in revenge for the executions during the Civil War) in 1927 after which several hundred IRA suspects were interned.

===Fianna Fáil comes to power===

The political representatives of the anti-Treaty side had re-grouped in 1926 as Fianna Fáil, leaving only a minority of intransigent republicans in Sinn Féin and the IRA who refused to recognise the legitimacy of the state. Fianna Fáil initially refused to take their seats after being elected to the Dáil. However, they entered the parliament in 1927, in part to disassociate themselves from the killing of Kevin O&#x27;Higgins.

Initially Cumann na nGaedheal had been popular as the party that had established the state, but by 1932, their economic conservatism and continued repression of anti-Treaty Republicans was becoming unpopular. Fianna Fáil won the 1932 election on a programme of developing Irish industry, creating jobs, providing more social services and cutting the remaining links with the British Empire. In 1932, Fianna Fáil entered government in coalition with the Labour Party, but a year later they won an absolute majority. They would be in government without interruption until 1948 and for much of the rest of the 20th century.

One of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s first actions in government was to legalise the IRA and to release imprisoned republicans. IRA members began attacking Cumann na nGaedhal supporters, who they considered &quot;traitors&quot; at rallies. This greatly antagonised pro-Treaty Civil War veterans, who in response formed the quasi-fascist Blueshirts (initially the &quot;Army Comrades Association&quot;), led by the former Garda Commissioner Eoin O&#x27;Duffy to oppose the IRA. There were frequent riots and occasional shootings between the two factions in the early 1930s. De Valera banned the Blueshirts in 1933, after a threatened march on the Dáil, in imitation of Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome. Not long afterwards, in 1936, de Valera made a clean break with political violence when he banned the increasingly left-wing IRA after they murdered a landlord&#x27;s agent, Richard More O&#x27;Farrell, in a land dispute and fired shots at police during a strike of Tramway workers in Dublin. In 1939 it enacted the Offences against the State Act for the prosecution of illegal armed groups, an act similar to those passed by previous governments to combat dissident militant groups.

===Economic nationalism and trade war with Britain===

Fianna Fáil&#x27;s economic programme marked a sharp break with their predecessors in Cumann na nGaedheal. Instead of free trade, which benefited mainly substantial farmers, Fianna Fáil pursued the nationalist aim of establishing Irish domestic industries, which were protected from foreign competitors by tariffs and subsidies. Fianna Fáil made it mandatory for foreign companies to have a quota of Irish members on their boards. They also set up a large number of semi-state companies such as the Electricity Supply Board and the Turf Development Board. While this state-led strategy had some positive results, emigration remained high throughout this period, with up to 75,000 leaving for Britain in the late 1930s.

In the course of their pursuit of economic independence, Fianna Fáil also provoked what is known as the Anglo-Irish Trade War with Britain in 1933, by refusing to continue paying back &quot;land annuities&quot; money provided under the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 by the British Government to enable Irish farmers purchase their own land. The British in retaliation raised tariffs on Irish agricultural produces, hurting Ireland&#x27;s export trade. De Valera in turn raised taxes on the importation of British goods. The burden of this standoff fell on the cattle farmers, who could no longer sell their cattle at competitive rates in Britain. Additionally the Fianna Fáil government continued to collect half the land annuities as taxation. Police and sometimes troops were used to seize cattle off farmers who would not or could not pay. Farmers aggrieved at these policies were one of the principal support bases of the Blueshirt movement

The dispute with Britain was finally settled in 1939. Half of the land annuity debt (c. £90 million) was written off and the rest paid as lump sum. The British also returned to Ireland the Treaty ports, which they had retained since the Treaty of 1922. Irish control over these bases made possible Irish neutrality in the looming Second World War.

===Constitutional status===

The Free State from 1922 to 1937 was a constitutional monarchy over which the British monarch reigned (from 1927 with the title &quot;King of Ireland&quot;). The Representative of the Crown was known as the Governor-General. The Free State had a bicameral parliament and a cabinet, called the &quot;Executive Council&quot; answerable to the lower house of parliament, the Free State Dáil. The head of government was called the President of the Executive Council.

The parliament of the UK passed The Statute of Westminster 1931, which granted legislative independence to the six Dominions, Australia, Canada, the Irish Free State, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa.
In 1932, after Éamon de Valera and Fianna Fáil&#x27;s victory in the general election, the 1922 Irish Free State constitution was amended through a series of legislative changes, was subsequently replaced with a new constitution. This document was drawn up by the de Valera administration. It was approved by the electorate in a plebiscite by a simple majority.

On 29 December 1937, the new &quot;Constitution of Ireland&quot; came into effect, renaming the Irish Free State to simply &quot;Éire&quot; or in the English language &quot;Ireland&quot;. The Governor-General was replaced by a President of Ireland and a new more powerful prime minister, called the &quot;Taoiseach&quot;, came into being, while the Executive Council was renamed the &quot;Government&quot;. Though it had a president, the new state was not a republic. The British monarch continued to reign theoretically as &quot;King of Ireland&quot;, and was used as an &quot;organ&quot; in international and diplomatic relations, with the President of Ireland relegated to symbolic functions within the state but never outside it.

===Status of Northern Ireland===

The AngloIrish Treaty provided that should Northern Ireland choose not to be included in the Free State, a Boundary Commission would be set up to revise the borders between the two jurisdictions. The Irish perspective was that this was intended to allow largely nationalist areas of Northern Ireland to join the Free State, and shortly after the establishment of the Free State this commission came into being. However the commission concentrated on economic and topographic factors, rather than the political aspirations of the people who would be living near the new border. In 1925, the Boundary Commission report, contrary to expectations, proposed ceding some small areas of the Free State to Northern Ireland. For a variety of reasons the governments agreed to accept the original Northern Ireland/Southern Ireland delineation in return for Britain dropping the Irish obligation to share in paying Britain&#x27;s Imperial debts. The Dáil approved the boundary by a large margin of 71 to 20.

==World War II, neutrality, and &quot;the Emergency&quot; 1939–1945==
The outbreak of the Second World War put the state and the de Valera government in a difficult situation. It came under pressure from Britain and later the US, to enter the war, or at least to allow the allies to use its ports. However, there remained a minority who felt that national independence had yet to be achieved and who were resolutely opposed to any alliance with Britain. For this reason, de Valera ensured that the state remained neutral throughout the War which was officially known as the &quot;Emergency&quot;. The state&#x27;s decision to adopt neutrality was influenced by memories of the AngloIrish War and the Civil War, and the state&#x27;s lack of military preparedness for involvement in a war.

The remnants of the IRA, which had split several times into ever smaller groupings since 1922, embarked on a bombing campaign in Britain (see Sabotage Campaign (IRA)) and some attacks in Northern Ireland (see Northern Campaign), intended to force a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Some of its leadership, notably Seán Russell, sought help from Nazi Germany for this project. De Valera, considering this activity a threat to Irish neutrality and therefore to the state&#x27;s vital interests, interned all active IRA members and executed several. Another was hanged in Northern Ireland for shooting a policeman.

Behind the scenes the Irish state worked with the Allies; in 1940, the government agreed provisionally with Britain that it would accept the entry of British troops and put its own armed forces under their command should the Germans invade Ireland – see Plan W. There was a provisional German plan for an invasion of Ireland, known as Operation Green, but it was never carried out. Additionally, Irish fire fighters were sent to Northern Ireland to help fight the fires caused by the German bombing of Belfast in 1941 (See Belfast Blitz).

There were a number of further examples of cooperation. German pilots who crashed in Ireland were interned while Allied airmen were returned to Britain. There was also mutual sharing of intelligence. For example, the date of the D-Day Normandy landings was decided on the basis of transatlantic weather reports supplied by the Irish state. It is estimated that between 43,000 and 150,000 men from Ireland took part, with that number roughly evenly divided between Northern Ireland and the southern state.

Conversely, following the suicide of Adolf Hitler, de Valera, following diplomatic protocol, controversially offered condolences to the German ambassador.

Economically, the war was a difficult time for the state. Industrial production fell by 25%. Unlike the First World War, when Irish farmers had made substantial profits selling food to Britain, in the Second World War, Britain imposed strict price controls on Irish agricultural imports. Due to the war, imports to Ireland dried up, leading to a drive for self-sufficiency in food and strict rationing, which continued until the 1950s. Nevertheless, as a result of neutrality, Ireland emerged from the war having been spared the physical destruction and extreme hardship undergone by combatant nations on the European mainland.

==Relationship with Northern Ireland 1945–present==
The official position of the Irish state, as laid out in the 1937 constitution, was that the territory of the state comprised the whole island of Ireland, but that its laws applied only to the territory of the Free State, as outlined in the 1922 Treaty. Thereafter the policies of Irish governments pursued the peaceful unification of Ireland through the pressure groups such as the anti-Partition League. However, at the same time, the state recognised that paramilitary groups – in particular the IRA – were also a threat to its own security. Furthermore, their attacks on Northern Ireland could drag the Irish state into an unwanted confrontation with Britain.

In the 1950s, the IRA launched a campaign of attacks on Northern security targets along the border (the Border Campaign). The Irish government first detained the IRA&#x27;s leaders under the Offences Against the State Act and later introduced internment for all IRA activists. This helped to halt the campaign in its tracks, and the IRA called it off in 1962. In the aftermath of this episode, the southern government under Seán Lemass, himself an IRA veteran of the War of Independence and Civil War, tried to forge closer ties with the authorities in Northern Ireland to promote peaceful co-operation on the island. He and Northern premier Terence O&#x27;Neill exchanged visits, the first of the respective heads of state to do so since the very early days of partition in 1922.

However, in 1969, the Irish government found itself placed in a very difficult position when conflict erupted in Northern Ireland in the form of rioting in Derry, Belfast and other urban centres. The violence arose out of agitation by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association for the redress of grievances of Catholics and nationalists in Northern Ireland. Two episodes in particular caused concern – the Battle of the Bogside in Derry, in which nationalists fought the police for three days and the rioting in Belfast, in which several Catholic neighbourhoods were attacked and burned by loyalists.

Taoiseach Jack Lynch in a televised address, said, &quot;we can not stand by and watch innocent people being injured and perhaps worse&quot;, comments taken to mean that Irish troops would be sent over the border to assist Northern nationalists. This was not done, but Irish Army field hospitals were set up and some money and arms were covertly supplied to nationalist groups for self-defence. Government ministers, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, were later put on trial for allegedly supplying arms to republican paramilitaries.

At the same time, the Provisional IRA, emerged from the 1969 rioting intending to launch an armed campaign against the Northern state. By 1972, their campaign was of considerable intensity, killing over 100 British soldiers in that year alone. Unlike the IRA campaign of the 1950s, this campaign was viewed as having considerable public support among Northern nationalists and for this reason, Irish governments did not introduce internment as they had previously, in the absence of a political settlement in Northern Ireland. The Irish government also refused to allow British and Northern Ireland security units to pursue Republican paramilitaries over the border into the Republic and arrested those soldiers or police who did enter its territory armed.

The Irish government, however, continued to view armed activity by republicans on its territory as a major security risk. The Gardaí and the Irish Army were used to try to impede the activities of republican paramilitary groups throughout the conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles (c. 1968–1998). The paramilitaries&#x27; activities in the south included bank robberies, kidnappings and occasional attacks on the Irish security forces (killing 6 gardaí and one Irish soldier) as well as attacks on British forces over the border. Representatives of republican paramilitaries were forbidden from appearing on television or radio by Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, (1971). There were also some attacks by loyalist paramilitary groups in the southern territory, notably the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people.

However, the PIRA successfully used the South as a safe haven in order to sustain its campaign against the British in Northern Ireland, widely owing to the sympathy of the Southern Irish population. Irish historian Gearóid Ó Faoleán wrote for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that &quot;[t]hroughout the country, republicans were as much a part of their communities as any others. Many were involved in the GAA or other local organisations and their neighbours could, to paraphrase [Irish writer Tim Pat] Coogan, quietly and approvingly mutter about the &#x27;boys&#x27; – and then go off without a qualm the next day to vote for a political party aggressively opposed to the IRA.&quot; Shannon Airport and Cork and Cobh harbours were used extensively by the IRA for arms importation overseas during the early 1970s aided by sympathetic workers on-site. Most IRA training camps were located in the republic, as did safe houses and arms factories. The vast majority of the finances used in the IRA campaign came from criminal and legitimate activities in the Republic of Ireland rather than overseas sources. Large numbers of improvised explosive devices and firearms were manufactured by IRA members and supporters in Southern Ireland and then transported into Northern Ireland and England for use against targets in these regions. For example, one IRA arms factory near Stannaway Road, Dublin, was producing six firearms a day in 1973. An arms factory in the County Dublin village of Donabate in 1975 was described as &quot;a centre for the manufacture of grenades, rockets and mortars.&quot; Gelignite stolen from quarries, farms and construction sites in the Republic was behind the 48,000lbs of explosives detonated in Northern Ireland in the first six months of 1973 alone. IRA training ranged from basic small arms and explosives manufacturing to heavy machine guns, overseen by Southern Irish citizens, including a former member of the Irish Defence Forces. Thousands of Irish citizens in the Republic joined the IRA throughout the conflict; for example, the assassination of Louis Mountbatten in August 1979 was carried out by IRA member Thomas McMahon from Monaghan.

In 1985, the Irish government was part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in which the British government recognised that the Irish government had a role to play in a future peace settlement in the North. In 1994, the Irish government was heavily involved in negotiations which brought about an IRA ceasefire.

In 1998, the Irish authorities were again party to a settlement, the Good Friday Agreement, which set up power-sharing institutions within Northern Ireland, north–south instructions and links between the various components of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The Irish state also changed Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution to acknowledge both the existence of Northern Ireland and the desire of Irish nationalists for a united Ireland. Even in the wake of the post-Good Friday Agreement incorporation of the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin into electoral politics, there remain several republican paramilitary groups who wish to use force to destabilise Northern Ireland – such as the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA. Irish security forces continue to be used to try to prevent attacks by such groups.

==1949 – Declaring a republic==

On 18 April 1949 the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which had been enacted by the Oireachtas, came into force. That legislation described Ireland as the Republic of Ireland but did not change the country&#x27;s name. The international and diplomatic functions previously vested in or exercised by the king were now vested in the President of Ireland who finally became unambiguously the Irish head of state. Under the Commonwealth rules then in force, the declaration of a republic automatically terminated the state&#x27;s membership of the British Commonwealth. Unlike India, which became a republic shortly afterwards, Ireland chose not to reapply for admittance to the Commonwealth. In 1949 the IRA Army Council issued a statement which outlined its position on the declaration of the Republic: 

Though a republic since 1949, the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 that had established the Kingdom of Ireland was not finally repealed until 1962, along with many other obsolete Parliament of Ireland statutes. However, long before that, the British Government in its Ireland Act 1949 recognised that &quot;the Republic of Ireland had ceased to be part of His Majesty&#x27;s dominions&quot; (but would not be &quot;a foreign country&quot; for the purposes of any law).

The state joined the United Nations in December 1955, after a lengthy veto by the Soviet Union. Turned away by the veto of France in 1961, the state finally succeeded in joining the European Communities (now known as the European Union) in 1973.

==Current history==
===Economic, political and social history, 1945–1998===
Ireland emerged from the Second World War in better condition than many European countries, having been spared direct involvement in the war and with an income per capita higher than that of most belligerent countries. Ireland also benefited from a loan under the Marshal Plan; $36 million, at 2% interest. The money was spent on an extensive housing and slum-clearing project and a successful campaign to eradicate tuberculosis.

However, whereas most European countries experienced a sustained economic boom in the 1950s, Ireland did not, its economy growing by only 1% a year during the decade. Ireland as a result experienced sharp emigration of around 50,000 per year during the decade and the population of the state fell to an all-time low of 2.81 million. The policies of protectionism and low public spending which had predominated since the 1930s were widely viewed to be failing.

Fianna Fáil&#x27;s political dominance was broken in 1948–51 and in 1954–1957, when coalitions led by Fine Gael (descendants of Cumann na nGaedheal), and including the Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta won elections and formed the government. However, the periods of coalition rule did little to radically alter government policies. An initiative by Noël Browne, the Minister for Health, to introduce the Mother and Child Scheme, providing free medical care to mothers and children, came to nothing when opposed by the Catholic Church and by private medical practitioners.

Poor economic growth and lack of social services led Seán Lemass, who succeeded the veteran Éamon de Valera as leader of Fianna Fáil and as Taoiseach in 1958, to state that if economic performance did not improve, the very future of the independent Irish state was at risk. &quot;[Something] has got to be done now... If we fail everything else goes with it and all the hopes of the past will have been falsified&quot;.
Lemass, along with T. K. Whitaker as Secretary of the Department of Finance, set specific plans for economic growth, including planned investment in industrial infrastructure and dropping of many protective tariffs and giving tax incentives to foreign manufacturing companies to set up in Ireland. Attracting foreign direct investment has remained a central part of Irish economic planning since that time. The economic plans of the Lemass era yielded economic growth of 4% a year between 1959 and 1973. A result of having more public revenue was more investment in social infrastructure – free secondary education, for instance, was instituted in 1968, by the then Minister for Education, Donough O&#x27;Malley. Emigration fell as living standards in Ireland went up by 50% and began to catch up with the European average.

However, in the 1970s, the world energy crisis – where OPEC countries withheld supplies of oil – resulted in rising inflation and a budget deficit in Ireland. From 1973 to 1977 a coalition government of Fine Gael and Labour tried to keep spending under control by imposing a series of cuts in public spending.

The period of economic crisis of the late 1970s provoked a new economic crisis in Ireland that would endure throughout the 1980s. Fianna Fáil, back in power after the 1977 election, tried to reactivate the economy by increasing public spending, which by 1981 amounted to 65% of Irish GNP. Irish national debt in 1980 was £7 billion or 81% of GNP. By 1986, it was over £23 billion – 142% of Irish GNP.

This massive public debt hindered Irish economic performance throughout the 1980s. The governments of Charles Haughey (Fianna Fáil) and Garret FitzGerald (Fine Gael/Labour) borrowed even more, and income tax rates went up to between 35% and 60% of wage earners&#x27; income. The combination of high taxes and high unemployment caused emigration to pick up again, with up to 40,000 leaving the country each year in that decade. Power alternated between the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, with some governments not even lasting a year, and in one case, three elections in a period of 18 months.

Starting in 1989 there were significant policy changes with economic reform, tax cuts, welfare reform, an increase in competition, and a ban on borrowing to fund current spending. There was also a &quot;Social Partnership Agreement&quot; with the trade unions, whereby unions agreed not to strike in return for gradual, negotiated pay increases. These policies was started by the 1989–1992 Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat government, with the support of the opposition Fine Gael, and continued by the subsequent Fianna Fáil/Labour government (1992–1994) and Fine Gael/Labour Party/Democratic Left governments (1994–1997). This was known as the Tallaght Strategy, where the opposition promised not to oppose certain necessary economic measures brought in by the government of the day.

The Irish economy returned to growth by the 1990s but unemployment remained high until the second half of that decade.
===&quot;Celtic Tiger;&quot; Economic growth of 1990s===

The state had had a disappointing economic performance for much of its existence, but it became one of the fastest growing economies in the world by the 1990s, a phenomenon known as the Celtic Tiger. One factor in this was a policy of attracting foreign investment by offering very low taxes on profits (&quot;corporations taxes&quot;, which were set at 12%) and by investing in education – offering a well-educated work force at relatively low wages and access to the now-open European market. The second factor was getting public spending under control by a series of agreements, termed &#x27;social partnership&#x27; with the trade unions – where gradual increases in pay were awarded in return for no industrial action. However it was not until the second half of the 1990s that figures for unemployment and emigration were reversed.

===21st century===
By the beginning of the 21st century, in 2000s, Ireland had become the second richest (in terms of GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity) member of the European Union, had moved from being a net recipient of EU funds to a net contributor, and from a position of net emigration to one of net immigration. In 2005, its &quot;per capita&quot; GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity) became the second highest in the world (behind Switzerland) with 10 percent of the population born abroad. The population grew to an all-time high for the state of about 4.5 million.

By 2001, Ireland had a substantial budget surplus and the first decade of the new millennium also saw a significant expansion of public spending on infrastructure and social services. As against this, several state-run industries were also privatised – Eircom for instance. In 2002, Irish national debt was 32% of GNP and fell further until 2007.

The Celtic Tiger started in the mid-1990s and boomed until 2001, when it slowed down, only to pick up again in 2003. It slowed again in 2007 and in June 2008 the Irish Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) predicted that Ireland would go into recession briefly before growth would resume.

However, since 2001, the Irish economy had been heavily dependent of the property market and when this crashed in 2008, the country&#x27;s economy was badly hit.

The Irish banks had invested heavily in loans to property developers and were facing ruin as result of the property markets&#x27; collapse and also the international &#x27;Credit crunch&#x27; or drying up of loans from abroad. Much of the Irish economy and public finances had also depended on the property market and its collapse at roughly the same time as the banking crisis impacted all parts of the Irish economy. It also meant that revenue collected by the state fell radically.

This situation was compounded by the assumption by the state of the banks&#x27; debts in 2008. The Irish government led by Brian Cowen, following a late-night meeting with all the senior banking officials in the country on 30 September 2008, agreed to cover all of the banks&#x27; debts. This debt, now estimated at over €50 billion, (over half of which will be paid to Anglo Irish Bank) imposed a heavy burden on the tax-payer and severely damaged Ireland&#x27;s ability to borrow money from the International Bond markets.

The second problem is that public spending, which rose steeply in the 2000s, was now unsustainable. The total Irish budget deficit as of December 2010, stood at 93.4 billion with General Government Debt at 148.6 billion or 94.2% of GDP. As it was not clear how much money would be needed to revitalise the banks – to clear their debts and supply them with enough money to start lending again – the international markets were unwilling to lend Ireland money at an interest rate it could afford.

Under pressure from the European Union, which feared a &#x27;run&#x27; (selling causing a collapse in value) of the euro, Ireland was forced to accept a 16-year loan of €85 billion at just under 6% interest from IMF and EU itself. Not only were the interest rates of the loan high, but the deal also involved a humiliating loss of sovereignty, in which Irish budgets had to first be approved by other parliaments of the EU – notably that of Germany.

The political result of this crisis was the fall of the Cowen government and a shattering defeat for Fianna Fáil in the 2011 Irish general election, in which the party won just 17% of the vote and retained only 20 out of its 71 seats in the Dáil. Emigration from Ireland has again picked up and many remain anxious about the economic future. Leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny, became the new Prime Minister after the election to succeed Brian Cowen.

In the 2016 Irish general election, Fine Gael remained the largest party in parliament, but lost seats. After the resignation of Enda Kenny, Leo Varadkar became the new Prime Minister and leader of Fine Gael, in June 2017. The background of Varadkar, as the gay son of an Indian immigrant, made this choice historical.

In early 2020, the general election was an unprecedented three-way race, with the three largest parties each winning a share of the vote between 20% and 25%. Fianna Fáil finished with 38 seats (including the Ceann Comhairle). Sinn Féin made significant gains; it received the most first-preference votes, and won 37 seats, the party&#x27;s best result since its modern iteration in 1970. Fine Gael, the governing party led by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, finished third both in seats (35) and in first-preference votes.

International news outlets described the result as a historic break from the two-party system, as it was the first time in almost a century that neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael won the most votes. Furthermore, the combined vote share of the two traditional main parties fell to a historic low. The leaders of those parties had long ruled out forming a coalition government with Sinn Féin.

In June 2020, leader of Fianna Fáil, Micheál Martin, became the new Irish prime minister (taoiseach). He formed a historical three-party coalition consisting of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party. It was the first time in history that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were in the same government. The previous prime minister and leader of Fine Gael, Leo Varadkar, became the deputy prime minister (tánaiste). Martin was scheduled to lead the country as Prime Minister until December 2022, before changing posts with Varadkar.

In December 2022, Varadkar returned as Taoiseach and Martin took the deputy role as Tánaiste. In the coalition agreement, they had officially agreed to share the role of Taoiseach. In April 2024, Varadkar was replaced as Irish prime minister by the new leader of the Fine Gael, Simon Harris.

==Social liberalisation==
In the late 20th century, Irish society underwent rapid social change. After the introduction of free education in the late 1960s, many more people had access to second and third level qualifications. The relative economic success of the 1960s and 1970s also decreased emigration, meaning that Ireland became a younger and much more urban society than before. The spread of television and other mass media also exposed Irish citizens to a far wider range of influences than previously. All of these factors loosened the power of the traditional political parties and the Catholic Church over society.

By the 1980s, some were calling for liberalisation of the state&#x27;s laws, particularly a review of the bans on divorce, contraception, and homosexuality. However, they were also opposed by well-organised groups who accused the reformers of being irreligious and &quot;anti-family&quot;. That decade saw bitter disagreement between socially conservative, principally religious, elements and liberals over a series of referendums.

In 1983, the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign campaigned for and won a referendum, explicitly including a ban on abortion into the constitution – the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland.

The liberals had a victory in 1985, when it was made legal to buy condoms and spermicides without prescription. Nevertheless, it was not until 1993 that all restrictions on information and sale of contraceptives were abolished. In 1986, the Fine Gael/Labour coalition proposed to remove the ban on divorce. This was opposed by Fianna Fáil and the Catholic Church and the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1986 was defeated in a referendum.

Since 1992, the state has become less socially conservative. Liberalisation has been championed by figures like Mary Robinson, a radical feminist senator who became President of Ireland, and David Norris, who led the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform. Homosexual sex was decriminalised by an act of parliament in 1993.

The constitutional ban on abortion was softened somewhat in 1992. After a referendum in that year, the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1992 was approved, it was made legal to perform an abortion to save the life of a mother, to give information about abortion and to travel to another country for an abortion.

In 1995, after a referendum, the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland legalised divorce.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, these questions were deeply divisive in the Republic of Ireland and exposed deep social cleavages between religious and secular-minded people, urban and rural, middle and working classes. Issues such as divorce, contraception and homosexuality have since become accepted by many and have ceased to be matters of serious political debate. However, legalising abortion remained controversial. Opinion poll evidence on the subject of abortion was mixed.

In 2015, Ireland became the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage by means of popular referendum, when the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed by just over 60% of voters.

In 2018, a referendum repealing the ban on abortion was passed, the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. Legislation to allow elective abortion care up to 12 weeks and under restrictions after that time was enacted in the form of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018. Abortion services began on 1 January 2019.

==National scandals==

Social liberalisation was widely accepted by the 1990s due in part to a series of a very damaging scandals in that decade. The revelation that one senior Catholic bishop, Eamon Casey, fathered a child by a divorcée caused a major reaction, as did the discovery of a child abuse ring whereby offenders became clerics in order to use their position in the Roman Catholic Church to obtain access to victims—notably the infamous paedophile Father Brendan Smyth. Some other bishops, including John Magee and Brendan Comiskey, subsequently resigned between 2002 and 2010 over their mishandling of child abuse cases in their dioceses.
It was also revealed, in the 2000s, after an inquiry, the Ryan Commission, that there had been widespread physical and sexual abuse of children in secular and Church-run industrial schools and orphanages from the 1920s until the 1960s. These were institutions which were set up to house children without families or with very poor parents. In some cases, it was claimed, these children had been removed from their parents only to be put into institutions worse than their previous state.

While other factors also played a role, the scandals in the Catholic Church contributed to a steep decline in church attendance among Irish Catholics. While in 1991, 92% of the Republic&#x27;s population identified themselves as Roman Catholics, by 2006 this had dropped to 86%. More starkly, whereas in 1990, 85% of Catholics attended mass weekly, by 2008 this had fallen to 43% among Catholics and 40% of the population in general. (See also Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland)

In the 1990s, a series of tribunals began inquiring into major allegations of corruption against senior politicians. Ray Burke, who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1997 was sentenced to six months in prison following his conviction on charges of tax evasion in January 2005. The Beef Tribunal in the early 1990s found that major food companies, notably in Iraq had been given preferential treatment by the Fianna Fáil government in return for donations to that party. Former Taoisigh Charles Haughey and Bertie Ahern were also brought before Tribunals to explain their acceptance of very large personal donations of money to them by private businessmen.

<doc id="230786" wikidata="Q1581069" url="?curid=230786" title="Luther Blissett (pseudonym)">
<text>Luther Blissett is a multiple-use name, an &quot;open pop star&quot; informally adopted and shared by hundreds of artists and activists all over Europe and the Americas since 1994. The pseudonym first appeared in Bologna, Italy, in mid-1994, when a number of cultural activists began using it for staging a series of urban and media pranks and to experiment with new forms of authorship and identity. From Bologna the multiple-use name spread to other European cities, such as Rome and London, as well as countries such as Germany, Spain, and Slovenia. Sporadic appearances of Luther Blissett have been also noted in Canada, the United States, Finland, and Brazil.

For reasons that remain unknown, though according to one former member the decision was based purely on the perceived comic value of the name, the pseudonym was borrowed from a real-life Luther Blissett, a notable association football player, who played for A.C. Milan, Watford F.C. and England in the 1980s. In December 1999, the Italian activists who had launched the Luther Blissett Project in 1994 decided to discontinue usage of the name by committing symbolic ritual suicide, or seppuku. After authoring the best-selling historic novel &quot;Q&quot; as &quot;Luther Blissett&quot;, five of them went on to found the writers&#x27; collective Wu Ming.

==Luther Blissett&#x27;s mythmaking and politics==
While the folk heroes of the early-modern period and the nineteenth century served a variety of social and political purposes, the Luther Blissett Project (LBP) were able to utilize the media and communication strategies unavailable to their predecessors. According to Marco Deseriis, the main purpose of the LBP was to create &quot;a folk hero of the information society&quot; whereby knowledge workers and immaterial workers could organize and recognize themselves. Luther Blissett became a positive mythic figure that was supposed to embody the very process of community and cross-media storytelling rather than being understood only as a media prankster and culture jammer. Roberto Bui, one of the co-founders of the LBP and Wu Ming, explains the function of Luther Blissett and other radical folk heroes as mythmaking or mythopoesis:

Mythopoesis is the social process of constructing myths, by which we do not mean &quot;false stories,&quot; we mean stories that are told and shared, re-told and manipulated, by a vast and multifarious community, stories that may give shape to some kind of ritual, some sense of continuity between what we do and what other people did in the past. A tradition. In Latin the verb &quot;tradere&quot; simply meant &quot;to hand down something,&quot; it did not entail any narrow-mindedness, conservatism or forced respect for the past. Revolutions and radical movements have always found and told their own myths.

Another important element was relationship of the Italian LBP to the autonomist-Marxist theory of labor known as workerism. Drawing from the work of Italian workerists, such as Antonio Negri, Paolo Virno, Maurizio Lazzarato and others, the activists of the LBP envisioned Blissett as the expression of the capacity of immaterial workers to produce forms of wealth that cannot be properly measured and attributed to an individual producer. The incalculability of these new forms of labor is articulated in the &quot;Declaration of Rights of Luther Blissett&quot;, redacted by the Roman LBP in 1995. In this manifesto, the LBP claims that because in late capitalism any social activity can potentially generate value, the culture and media industries should guarantee a basic income to every citizen detached from individual productivity:

The industry of the integrated spectacle and immaterial command owes me money. I will not come to terms with it until I will not have what is owed to me. For all the times I appeared on TV, films, and on the radio as a casual passersby or as an element of the landscape, and my image has not been compensated . . . for all the words or expressions of high communicative impact I have coined in peripheral cafes, squares, street corners, and social centers that became powerful advertising jingles, without seeing a dime; for all the times my name and my personal data have been put at work inside
stats, to adjust the demand, refine marketing strategies, increase the productivity of firms to which I could not be more indifferent; for all the advertising I continuously make by wearing branded t-shirts, backpacks, socks, jackets, bathing suits, towels, without my body being remunerated as a commercial billboard; for all of this and much more, the industry of the integrated spectacle owes me money! I understand it may be difficult to calculate how much they owe me as an individual. But this is not necessary at all, because I am Luther Blissett, the multiple and the multiplex.
And what the industry of the integrated spectacle owes me, it is owed to the many that I am, and is owed to me because I am many. From this viewpoint, we can agree on a generalized compensation. You will not have peace until I will not have the money! LOTS OF MONEY BECAUSE I AM MANY: CITIZEN INCOME FOR LUTHER BLISSETT!

==Limited selection of Blissett&#x27;s stunts, pranks, and media hoaxes==
* January 1995 — Harry Kipper, a British conceptual artist, disappears at the Italo-Slovenian border while touring Europe on a mountain bike, allegedly with the purpose of tracing the word &quot;ART&quot; on the map of the continent. The victim of the prank is a famous missing-persons prime-time show on the Italian state television. They send out a TV crew to look for a person that never existed. They go as far as London, where novelist Stewart Home and Richard Essex of the London Psychogeographical Association pose as close friends of Kipper&#x27;s. The hoax goes on until &quot;Luther Blissett&quot; claims responsibility for it.
* September 1994–May 1995 — In September 1994, a Bolognese community radio began broadcasting Radio Blissett, a late-night show featuring a variable number of Luther Blissetts who &quot;patrolled&quot; the city on foot and called the studio from local phone booths. Inspired by the Lettrist-Situationist urban drift or dérive—a seemingly aimless wandering through the city whereby psychogeographers go in search of heightened emotional experiences—Radio Blissett allowed players to interact at a distance in real time. Listeners could also call in from home and direct the patrols to various locations to join or create unexpected social events, including guerrilla-theater interventions, street parties, three-sided football matches, and &quot;psychic attacks&quot; against public buildings and institutions. In the Spring 1995, the experiment was duplicated in Rome, where the wider extension of the city required the simultaneous use of car patrols and cell phones. The Saturday night show, which aired on the frequencies of Radio Città Futura, featured psychic attacks against the Italian copyright office, the office of employment, and other semi-improvised direct actions which culminated in one of the most well-known episodes of the Blissett’s saga.
* 17 June 1995 – A few dozen participating in the Roman Radio Blissett boarded a night tram at different consecutive stops. A rave party took place on the vehicle until the police decided to stop it. Requested to disembark and identify themselves, the ravers refused to identify themselves other than with the multiple-use name. A riot ensued in which the police fired three shots in the air. A journalist from Radio Citta&#x27; Futura covered the event with his cell phone broadcasting the riot and the shots on the radio program. The radio program caused a media sensation.
* June 1995 — Loota is a female chimpanzee whose paintings are to be exhibited at the Venice Biennale of Contemporary Arts. In the context of the hoax, Loota is described as a former victim of sadistic experiments in a pharmaceutical lab. The ape was then saved by the Animal Liberation Front, and later became a talented artist. Some newspapers announced the event. However, Loota did not exist.
* November 1995 — An article in the &quot;Workshop For A Non-Linear Architecture&quot; journal &quot;Viscosity&quot; stating that the K Foundation had announced a 23-year moratorium on &quot;all further activity&quot; following their burning of a million pounds in cash on the Isle of Jura is credited to Luther Blissett.
* 1998–2000 — In 1998, Italian art magazines such as &quot;Tema Celeste&quot; and &quot;Flesh Art&quot; begin reporting about the activities of Darko Maver, a hitherto unknown radical Serbian performance artist who has been disseminating hyper-realistic replicas of dismembered bodies in public spaces and hotel rooms across the former Yugoslavia. The magazines and a web site called &quot;Free Art Campaign&quot; report that the artist has been arrested by the Serbian authorities for his performances, which are meant to offer a scathing meditation on the hyperreality and media representation of the Yugoslav Wars. On 30 April 1999 the Free Art Campaign announces that Maver has been found dead in a prison cell in Podgorica, Montenegro. In March 2000, after alternative art spaces such as Kapelica Gallery in Ljubljana, Forte Prenestino in Rome, and major art venues such as the Venice Biennale have dedicated retrospectives and paid tribute to the artist, the Luther Blissett Project, along with the newborn net art collective 0100101110101101.org, announce that Darko Maver is himself a work of art.
* 2007 — A month before the appearance on the bookshelves of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, an email was sent to the &quot;Full Disclosure&quot; mailing list. In the e-mail, a self-declared group of Catholic hackers purportedly gave away the ending of the book, declaring they violated the computer systems of Bloomsbury (exclusive publisher of the Harry Potter books) to obtain it. The e-mail quoted Joseph Ratzinger&#x27;s words against Harry Potter. The news escalated from niche IT security mailing lists to mainstream media outlets, and in about 48 hours, it was run by CNN, BBC, Reuters, and over 9000 blogs (declared in the claim). Three days after, Luther Blissett claimed responsibility for the hoax in a public email in which he described how easily the media could be manipulated and how this could be used for psyops purposes. The revelation was ignored by most media outlets, with the notable exception of Noticiasdot, which published an interview with Luther Blissett. The psyop may be the cause of the 5% drop of Bloomsbury Publishing PLC stock quoted on the London Stock Exchange.

==&quot;Q&quot;==

The novel &quot;Q&quot; was written by four Bologna-based members of the LBP (Roberto Bui, Giovanni Cattabriga, Federico Guglielmi and Luca Di Meo), as a final contribution to the project, and published in Italy in 1999. So far, it has been translated into English (British and American), Spanish, German, Dutch, French, Portuguese (Brazilian), Danish, Polish, Greek, Czech, Russian, Turkish, Basque, Serbian and Korean. In August 2003 the book was nominated for the &quot;Guardian&quot; First Book Prize.

In January 2000, after their &quot;seppuku&quot;, the authors of &quot;Q&quot; formed a new group called Wu Ming (Chinese for &quot;nameless&quot;), under which name many novels were published in several languages and countries.

==Real Luther Blissett==

The multiple identity is named after the association footballer Luther Blissett, who used to play for Watford F.C. and A.C. Milan in the 1980s, among other teams. It is particularly popular among Italian subcultural activists and artists, possibly because of the Milan connection. The reasons the group chose the name remain unclear to mainstream journalists (e.g. the BBC suggested that Blissett, one of the first black footballers to play in Italy, may have been chosen to make a statement against right-wing extremists in the country). It has also been suggested that, when being scouted by A. C. Milan, the Watford player they were impressed with was in fact John Barnes and they mistakenly bid for Blissett being one of the two black strikers at the club. If this is the case, the group may have taken the name as a reference to a red herring.

Since the beginning of the project, the real Blissett has been aware of the group taking his name. However, early reports differed widely in saying whether he liked the attention he received because of them. On 30 June 2004 he appeared on the British television sports show &quot;Fantasy Football League - Euro 2004&quot;, broadcast on ITV, and joked about his own (alleged) involvement in the Luther Blissett Project. After host Frank Skinner read a line from the novel &quot;Q&quot; prologue (&quot;The coin of the kingdom of the mad dangles on my chest to remind me of the eternal oscillation of human fortunes&quot;), Blissett produced a copy of Luther Blissett&#x27;s Italian book &quot;Totò, Peppino e la guerra psichica&quot; (Toto, Peppino and the psychic war) and quoted extensively from it, in the original Italian: &quot;Chiunque può essere Luther Blissett, semplicemente adottando il nome Luther Blissett&quot; (Anyone can be Luther Blissett simply by adopting the name Luther Blissett). At the end of the show, hosts and guests all said in unison: &quot;I am Luther Blissett!&quot; Two years later, highlights of this broadcast were posted on YouTube.

<text>Cecil Court is a pedestrian street with Victorian shop-frontages in Westminster, England, linking Charing Cross Road and St Martin&#x27;s Lane. Since the 1930s, it has been known as the new Booksellers&#x27; Row.

==Early background==
One of the older thoroughfares in Covent Garden, Cecil Court dates to the end of the 17th century and earlier maps clearly identify a hedgerow running down the street&#x27;s course. A tradesman&#x27;s route at its inception, it much later acquired the nickname &quot;Flicker Alley&quot; from the concentration of early film companies in the Court. It is now known as home to about a dozen antiquarian and second-hand independent bookshops, including specialists in modern first editions, collectible children&#x27;s books, early printing, rare maps and atlases, antique prints, music, and esoterica, as well as art galleries, an antiques shop, shops specialising in antique silver, militaria, numismatics, porcelain, jewellery and art deco.

The street is sometimes nicknamed &quot;Booksellers&#x27; Row&quot;; an earlier &quot;Booksellers&#x27; Row&quot; existed at Holywell Street, London, demolished circa 1900.

It has been suggested that the street was named after Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, the 1st Earl of Salisbury, an important courtier to Queen Elizabeth I and renowned as a trailblazing spymaster. However, it seems to be one of a number of nearby streets and places that have been named after the land-owning family including Cranbourn Street and The Salisbury pub on St Martin&#x27;s Lane.

A substantial part of Cecil Court was razed to the ground in 1735, almost certainly arson on the part of a tenant, Mrs. Colloway, who was running a brandy shop/brothel in the street at the time: she purchased kindling, emptied her brandy barrels, over-insured her stock and made certain that she was drinking nearby with friends at the time the fire took hold. However, she was acquitted.

==Association with Mozart==
The street rose from the ashes to become the temporary home of an eight-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart while he was touring Europe in 1764. For almost four months, the Mozart family lodged with barber John Couzin. Tickets for Mozart&#x27;s first London concerts were sold from Couzin&#x27;s shop and, while living there, the young Mozart performed twice for King George III and was tested for his musical ability by Dr. Charles Burney. According to some modern authorities, Mozart composed his first symphony while a resident of Cecil Court. In September 2011, the Cecil Court Traders&#x27; Association installed a plaque commemorating Mozart&#x27;s relatively brief, but significant, period of residence in the street. The plaque sits at Number 9 Cecil Court, which—contrary to earlier assumptions placing the Mozart lodgings at Number 19—has been confirmed as the site of John Couzin&#x27;s barber shop. Cecil Court bookseller Tim Bryars consulted original source material, including the parish rate books of the time and a number of antique maps, to establish where in the street the young Mozart lived.

The plaque was unveiled by actor and author Simon Callow, who created the role of Amadeus on stage. The ceremony was accompanied with music from members of Opera Holland Park and the City of London Sinfonia including pieces from Mozart&#x27;s London Sketchbook which it is quite possible might have been composed in Cecil Court.

==Flicker Alley==
Cecil Court was an important focus of the early British cinema industry, with over forty entries to be found in the database of the study of the film business in London, 1894–1914, organised by the AHRB Centre for British Film and Television Studies, searchable online as part of the London Project. Arising from this, the street is sometimes called &quot;Flicker Alley&quot;. The first film-related company arrived in Cecil Court in 1897, a year after the first demonstration of moving pictures in the United Kingdom and a decade before London&#x27;s first purpose-built cinema opened its doors. The street was renowned as the place to buy or hire a film in Edwardian London, associated with many of the most important film-makers and distributors in early cinema. Home-grown pioneers including Cecil Hepworth and James Williamson had their offices there; but so did international companies including Gaumont, Nordisk, and American Vitagraph.

Cecil Court&#x27;s importance has been frequently cited by filmmakers and historians. It was the location for the UK&#x27;s first concentration of film-related businesses, which were almost exclusively new companies, bringing new skills to the industry and sharing products, resources, information and clientele (for example, dividing the costs of transporting the film reels themselves, and offering joint screenings to the showmen who hired them). The earlier businesses tended to be &quot;one-stop shops&quot;—filmmakers and dealers in films and equipment. From 1907, this new wave of businesses were often more specialised: dealers in the import and distribution of foreign films, or specialists in film rental or equipment alone. One business specialised in cinema confectionery, and for a time the trade periodical &quot;The Bioscope&quot; was published from number 8.

The US-based Flicker Alley home video and film distribution company, founded in 2002, is named as a homage to Cecil Court&#x27;s history.
In December 2012, Simon Callow returned to Cecil Court to unveil a plaque celebrating &quot;Flicker Alley&quot; and the street&#x27;s significant role in the British film industry.

==Present-day==
The street is still owned by the Cecil family and the buildings one can see today were laid out c. 1894 during the tenure of long-serving British Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. Today, Cecil Court is part of the Jubilee Walkway (opened in 1977 as the Silver Jubilee Walkway). The nearest Underground station is Leicester Square.

==In popular culture==
The street is sometimes used as a location by film companies. On film, Cecil Court bookshops feature in &quot;Victim&quot; (1961), &quot;The Human Factor&quot; (1979), &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; (1987), &quot;Miss Potter&quot; (2006) and &quot;Last Christmas&quot; (2019). Bookshops set in Cecil Court feature briefly in a number of novels, such as Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s &quot;Broken Homes&quot;.

Cecil Court is one of several locations which has been touted as an inspiration for Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter franchise. When asked directly in 2020, author J. K. Rowling denied that there is any connection: &quot;I&#x27;m laughing here... I had no idea how many streets were claiming to be the inspiration for Diagon Alley...  [it was not] based on any real place&quot;.

Vinyl stickers in the style of blue heritage plaques were put on shop windows across the court, indicating which productions companies were located in each address between 1900 and 1915. Several lectures were organised, and the first &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; film (Hepworth, 1903) was screened in Tenderpixel Gallery with live musical accompaniment.
*Cecil Court appeared in the 1 December 2010 episode of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.

<text>Piccadilly Circus is a London Underground station in Central London. It is located directly beneath Piccadilly Circus itself, with entrances at every corner. The station is served by the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines and is located in Travel-card Zone 1. 

On the Bakerloo line, the station is between Oxford Circus and Charing Cross stations. On the Piccadilly line, it is between Green Park and Leicester Square stations.

==History==
The station was opened on 10 March 1906 by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (now the Bakerloo line) with the platforms of the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (now the Piccadilly line) being opened on 15 December 1906. As originally built it had, like other stations, a surface booking hall (designed, like many in central London built at that time, by Leslie Green). The development of traffic before and after World War I meant that the need for improved station facilities was acute – in 1907 1.5 million passengers used the station, by 1922 it had grown to 18 million passengers. It was decided to construct a sub-surface booking hall and circulating area, which would also provide public pedestrian subways. Work began in February 1925 and was completed in 1928. The architect was Charles Holden and the builder was John Mowlem &amp; Co: the whole complex cost more than half-a-million pounds. Eleven escalators were provided in two flights, leading to the two lines serving the station. Above these escalators was once a mural by artist Stephen Bone, showing the world with London at its centre. This mural was later replaced by advertising. The famous Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain (alias &quot;Eros&quot;), directly above the station, had to be moved to Victoria Embankment Gardens while the construction work was taking place.

The old station building designed by Leslie Green finally closed for traffic on 21 July 1929, it was demolished in the 1980s when the large building on the corner of Jermyn Street, Piccadilly and Haymarket was constructed; although parts of it remain preserved in disused areas.

The Bakerloo line platforms at Piccadilly Circus offer a unique view on the network: the back to back layout is itself unusual, but the single tunnel containing a crossover at the north end of the station allows passengers to see both platforms at once. 

This station can act as an intermediate terminus for southbound Bakerloo line trains. Piccadilly Circus is one of the few London Underground stations which have no associated buildings above ground.

London Transport Museum frequently runs guided tours of the original Edwardian parts of the station through its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme.

== Artwork ==

In 2016, Art on the Underground commissioned artists Langlands &amp; Bell to create an artwork to commemorate Frank Pick, the former CEO of London Transport, on the 75th anniversary of his death. The artwork &quot;Beauty &lt; Immortality&quot; is located in a prominent place on the wall of the ticket hall, with a Frank Pick tube roundel and bronze lettering in Johnston – a typeface commissioned by Pick in 1915, which is still used across the London transport network today.

==Future==
Piccadilly Circus is a proposed stop on the Chelsea-Hackney Line, also known as the Crossrail 2. It would be between Victoria and Tottenham Court Road stations. Effectively a new station would have to be built under the existing levels, possibly as part of a major overhaul of the existing buildings. However, there will only be a stop at Piccadilly Circus if the Chelsea-Hackney Line is part of the London Underground network and not part of the National Rail network. This is the same situation with many stations on the proposed route in Central London.

==Connections==
London Buses day and night routes serve the station.

<doc id="230811" wikidata="Q2640783" url="?curid=230811" title="New Black Panther Party">
<text>The New Black Panther Party (NBPP) is an American black nationalist organization founded in Dallas, Texas, in 1989. Despite its name, the NBPP is not an official successor to the Black Panther Party. Members of the original Black Panther Party have insisted that the new party has no legitimacy and &quot;there is no new Black Panther Party&quot;.

The Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights consider the NBPP to be a hate group, accusing the organization and its leaders of racism, antisemitism and anti-Zionism.

The NBPP traces its origins to the Black Panther Militia created in 1990 by original Panther Michael McGee in Milwaukee. However, as McGee expanded his organization, it later came under the control of Aaron Michaels in Dallas. In turn, Aaron Michaels lost control of the leadership of the group to Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a former leading member of the Nation of Islam, who proceeded to fill the ranks of the New Panthers with ex-Nation of Islam members and other Black Muslims. Under Muhammad and his successors&#x27; leadership, the New Panthers shifted radically from the ideology of the original Black Panther Party towards an extremist form of Black nationalism.

The NBPP is currently led by Krystal Muhammad. Malik Zulu Shabazz announced on an October 14, 2013 online radio broadcast that he was stepping down and that Hashim Nzinga, then national chief of staff, would replace him. This move created a schism within the group. A vote was held and Krystal Muhammad was elected leader of the group. However, those loyal to Nzinga left and formed a splinter group called the &quot;New Black Panther Party for Self Defence&quot; or &quot;NBPP SD&quot;.

==History==
In 1987, Michael McGee, an alderman in Milwaukee, threatened to disrupt white events throughout the city unless more jobs were created for black people. He held a &quot;state of the inner city&quot; press conference in 1990 at City Hall to announce the creation of the Black Panther Militia. Aaron Michaels, a community activist and radio producer in Dallas, Texas established a chapter of the Black Panther Militia in 1992, but choose to refer to his chapter as &quot;The New Black Panther Party&quot;.

Over time, McGee lost influence over the overall groups while Michaels&#x27; grew, and eventually, it would be Aaron Michaels who took overall leadership of the Panthers groups, now using &quot;New Black Panther Party&quot; as their banner. Michaels became increasingly radical, and so too did the group.

In 1994, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a prominent member of the Nation of Islam, survived an assassination attempt from a former member of that group. Following the attempt on his life, Muhammad left the Nation of Islam and went to Dallas to recover, and it was during this time that Muhammad became aligned to Aaron Michaels, and subsequently joined the NBPP. By 1998 Muhammad had seized entire control of the NBPP from Michaels by filling with former members of the Nation of Islam and other Black Muslims. In 2012, Michaels claimed it was at this point he departed from the NBPP.

In 1998, Khalid Abdul Muhammad brought the organization into the national spotlight when he led an armed group of NBPP members to provide armed protection to the family of James Byrd Jr., who had just been murdered in Jasper, Texas by three white supremacists. Events escalated into a confrontation between the NBPP and the Ku Klux Klan. Muhammad continued to seek out high profile and confrontational events, and that same year sought to organise a &quot;Million Youth March&quot; in Harlem, New York City. On the surface, the purpose of the march was to build solidarity amongst the black youth of America but Muhammad also sought to march into the heartland of Nation of Islam support and demonstrate he had a group to compete for their support. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sought to block the march but was overruled by a federal judge. The March went ahead on 5 September 1998 and Muhammad gave a racist and anti-semitic speech to an audience of 6,000. When the police attempted to end the march at the designated end time, Muhammad encouraged those in attendance to physically confront them, leading to a riot. It was in this same time period that Muhammad and the NBPP featured in an episode of Louis Theroux&#x27;s Weird Weekends entitled &quot;Black Nationalism&quot;.

Khalid Muhammad died of a brain aneurysm on February 17, 2001, and was succeeded by Malik Zulu Shabazz, a protege of Muhammad&#x27;s as well as his personal attorney. Like Muhammad, Shabazz continued to push the NBPP in an increasingly anti-Semitic and racial segregationist direction. Under Shabazz&#x27;s leadership, the group would continue to appear across America during instances of racial tension and conflict, however, Shabazz was never able to return the group to the high profile it had in the media and public&#x27;s mind during Muhammad&#x27;s time.

==Ideology==
The New Black Panther Party identifies with the original Black Panther Party and it claims to uphold its legacy. It also says that many others see the organization similarly. The NBPP is largely seen by both the general public and prominent members of the original party as illegitimate. Huey Newton Foundation members, containing a significant number of the original party&#x27;s leaders, once successfully sued the group; their ultimate objective in doing so—to prevent the NBPP from using the Panther name—appears to have been unsuccessful. In response to the suit, Aaron Michaels branded the original Panthers &quot;has-been wannabe Panthers&quot;, adding: &quot;Nobody can tell us who we can call ourselves.&quot;

Although the NBPP says it sees capitalism as the fundamental problem with the world and revolution as the solution, the new party does not draw its influences from Marxism or Maoism as the original party did. Instead, it promotes the Kawaida theory of Maulana Karenga, which includes black unity, collective action, and cooperative economics. The NBPP says it fights the oppression of black and brown people and that its members are on top of current issues facing black communities across the world. Also, it notes that not all of its members are members of the Nation of Islam, although the group acknowledges universal spirituality practices within the organization.

Over time, many groups subscribing to varying degrees of radicalism have called for the &quot;right to self-determination&quot; for black people, particularly US blacks. Critics of the NBPP say that the group&#x27;s politics represent a dangerous departure from the original intent of black nationalism; specifically, that they are starkly anti-white, and also antisemitic. The group blames the September 11 attacks on Jews. The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies the NBPP as a black separatist hate group and says that its leaders &quot;have advocated the killing of Jews and white people&quot;.

==Organization==
===Membership size===
As of 2009, the NBPP claimed a few thousand members organized in 45 chapters, while independent estimates by the Anti-Defamation League suggest that the group is much smaller but is nevertheless able to attract a large turnout of non-members to its events by focusing on specific issues of local interest.

===French Wing===
In April 2010, Malik Zulu Shabazz appointed French Black leader Kémi Séba as the representative of the movement in France. However, Séba left the position in 2011.

===2013 schism===
In October 2013, Malik Zulu Shabazz announced he was stepping down as leader of the organization. He attempted to place Hashim Nzinga as his main successor. However, this move prompted a body of the group to gather for a meeting, where they elected Krystal Muhammad as their new chairperson. These events prompted a split of the organization into two competing factions. Muhammad&#x27;s faction retained the name &quot;New Black Panther Party&quot;, while the Nzinga faction dubbed themselves &quot;The New Black Panther Party for Self Defence&quot; or &quot;NBPP SD&quot;. The two groups remain at odds, each attempting to control the name recognition of &quot;The New Panthers&quot;.

==Controversies==

The New Black Panther Party became involved in a melee outside Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney&#x27;s campaign headquarters after she lost a Democratic primary election to her opponent, Hank Johnson. The NBPP&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Hashim Nzinga, had been acting as security detail for McKinney when he physically attacked reporters, calling them Jews and insisting that they must focus on Hank Johnson rather than on McKinney, since Johnson, he alleged, was a &quot;Tom.&quot; In a subsequent appearance on the Fox News Channel program &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, Nzinga defended these actions. He accused his interviewers of being part of a &quot;Zionist&quot; media complex bent on defaming African Americans and, by extension, the New Black Panthers.

In 2006, the New Black Panther Party regained the media spotlight by intervening in the 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal, organizing marches outside Duke University and making numerous media appearances to demand that the jury organized by then-District Attorney Mike Nifong convict the accused lacrosse players. 

On April 12, 2007, after the case brought by Nifong collapsed and the Duke Lacrosse players were exonerated, Malik Zulu Shabazz appeared on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. He refused to apologize for his actions in the lead-up to the Duke University lacrosse rape scandal, stating that he did not know whether or not anything happened to the young accuser. He stated his beliefs that the rich white families of Duke had placed political pressure on the investigation and forced the charges to be dropped. When questioned by guest host Michelle Malkin, he labeled her a political prostitute and mouthpiece for a male, chauvinist, racist Bill O&#x27;Reilly. Malkin said, &quot;There&#x27;s only one whore on this split screen and it&#x27;s you, Mr. Shabazz.&quot; Shabazz replied, &quot;You should be ashamed of yourself for defending and being a spokesman for Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who has no respect for women.&quot;

Calling the NBPP extremist, critics have cited Muhammad&#x27;s Million Youth March in Harlem, a youth equivalent of the Million Man March, in which the protest against police brutality included speakers calling for the extermination of white South Africans. The rally ended in scuffles with the New York Police Department as Muhammad urged the crowd to attack officers who had attempted to confiscate firearms. Chairs and bottles were thrown at the police, but only a few in the clash suffered injuries. The Million Youth March was subsequently named an annual event.

King Samir Shabazz, a former Nation of Islam member and head of the New Black Panther Party&#x27;s Philadelphia chapter, has a long history of confrontational racist behavior. He advocated racial separation and made incendiary racial statements while promoting anti-police messages in the media and on the streets of Philadelphia. He publicly announced, &quot;I hate white people. All of them.&quot; He also suggested the killing of white babies. Shabazz was arrested in June 2013 for carrying a loaded, unlicensed weapon. The party has claimed his arrest is part of an &quot;onslaught of attacks against the New Black Panther Party.&quot;

===Alleged voter intimidation in Philadelphia===
During the 2008 presidential election, poll watchers found two New Black Panther militia members shouting racial slurs outside a polling place in Philadelphia. One of the two was a credentialed poll watcher, while the other was a New Black Panther member who had brought a police-style nightstick baton. A University of Pennsylvania student, Stephen Robert Morse, was hired by the local Republican Party on behalf of the John McCain presidential campaign to tape the incident. His video aired on several news outlets throughout the country. Republican poll watcher Chris Hill stated that voters were complaining about intimidation, while the District Attorney&#x27;s office stated that they had not been contacted by any voters. The New Black Panther with the nightstick was escorted away by the police.

On January 7, 2009, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil suit against the New Black Panther Party and three of its members alleging violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 over the incident at the Philadelphia polling place. The suit accused members King Samir Shabazz and Jerry Jackson of being outside a polling location wearing the uniform of the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, and said that Shabazz repeatedly brandished a police-style baton weapon. The suit sought an injunction preventing further violations of the Voting Rights Act. After the defendants did not appear for court, a default judgment was entered. On May 29, 2009, the Department of Justice requested and received an injunction against the member who had carried the nightstick, but against the advice of prosecutors who had worked on the case, department superiors ordered the suit dropped against the remaining members. On July 6, 2010, J. Christian Adams, a former lawyer for the Justice Department, testified before the Commission on Civil Rights and alleged that the case was dropped because &quot;[w]e abetted wrongdoing and abandoned law-abiding citizens&quot;. Former Civil Rights Division Voting Section Chief Christopher Coates testified on September 24, 2010, &quot;I am here today to testify about the Department of Justice&#x27;s final disposition of the New Black Panther Party case and the hostility in the Civil Rights Division and the Voting Section toward the equal enforcement of some of the federal voting laws.&quot; (pp. 7, 22–25; pp. 8, 1–2) Abigail Thernstrom, the Republican-appointed vice chairwoman of the Commission, wrote that the Panthers should perhaps have been prosecuted under section 11 (b) of the Voting Rights Act for [its] actions of November 2008, but the legal standards that must be met to prove voter intimidation—the charge—are very high. And &quot;The incident involved only two Panthers at a single majority-black precinct in Philadelphia. So far—after months of hearings, testimony and investigation no one has produced actual evidence that any voters were too scared to cast their ballots.&quot;

According to an April 23, 2010 press release from the New Black Panther Party, the Philadelphia member involved in the nightstick incident was suspended until January 2010. &quot;The New Black Panther Party made it clear then and now we don&#x27;t support voter intimidation ... The charges against the entire organization and the chairman were dropped. The actions of one individual cannot be attributed to an entire organization any more than every act of any member of the Catholic Church be charged to the Vatican.&quot;

===Bounty for George Zimmerman&#x27;s capture===
Another controversy occurred in 2012 after the NBPP offered a $10,000 bounty for the citizen&#x27;s arrest of George Zimmerman, the man who killed Trayvon Martin. The group also stated that it believed in &quot;a life for a life&quot;. The bounty offer was condemned and repudiated by Martin&#x27;s family and others, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The NBPP&#x27;s organizer, Mikhail Mohammed, said that the United States Constitution granted the right to a citizen&#x27;s arrest.

===Prevented from entering Canada===
In May 2007, Chairman Shabazz was invited by Black Youth Taking Action (BYTA) to speak at a rally at Queen&#x27;s Park in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and to give a lecture to students at Ryerson University. The Ryerson Students&#x27; Union (RSU) had endorsed the event as it called for grade-school curricula to acknowledge the historical contribution of African-Canadians and African-Americans, and for the Brampton, Ontario, super jail project to be dismantled. A spokesperson for the RSU later stated that support for the event was given &quot;before they knew that Shabazz was the speaker.&quot;

Shabazz arrived at Toronto Pearson International Airport as planned but Canada border officials prevented him from entering Canada because of past rhetoric that violated Canadian hate laws. Although Canada&#x27;s airports and borders are within the federal jurisdiction, the Ontario Community Safety and Correctional Services Minister, Monte Kwinter, justified the barring of Shabazz. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty expressed concern about Shabazz. The press reported that Shabazz was denied entry to Canada because of a minor criminal record. Shabazz flew back to Buffalo, New York and attempted to cross the border by car, but border agents spotted him and again prevented him from entering Canada.

The rally at Queen&#x27;s Park went ahead without Shabazz, with approximately 100 people, plus at least two dozen journalists. Ryerson University canceled the planned lecture. The university administration alerted the RSU that it had received e-mails of threats of violent disruption of the event. The RSU canceled Shabazz&#x27;s lecture because of safety concerns. Heather Kere, RSU&#x27;s Vice-President of Education, said, &quot;We definitely recognize there was some criticism of his views&quot; and &quot;we were endorsing the campaign&#x27;s goals and not the individual speaker.&quot; Kere added, &quot;He deflected attention away from the main point of the campaign. We still strongly believe in the campaign.&quot;

Hashim Nzinga, Shabazz&#x27;s chief of staff, blamed Jewish groups for the incident, stating in a telephone interview, &quot;They let these groups like the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) and the JDL (Jewish Defense League), which is nothing but a bunch of gangsters, dictate what happens in the world today,&quot; and &quot;They told Canada not to let us in and Canada followed [its] rules, because this country is run from Israel.&quot; Nkem Anizor, president of the BYTA, also blamed the &quot;Jewish lobby&quot; for the government&#x27;s decision to deny Shabazz entry to Canada, Shabazz later said, &quot;Canada is on Malik alert,&quot; and &quot;B&#x27;nai Brith has won this one, and I&#x27;m starting to see the power of the Jewish lobby in Canada, full force. I thought Canada was free. I think this is evidence that black people are being oppressed in Canada.&quot;

===Involvement of Micah Xavier Johnson===

Micah Xavier Johnson, who ambushed and shot at police officers in Dallas, Texas, in July 2016 after a peaceful protest against police killings of African-American men elsewhere in the United States, had &quot;liked&quot; the Facebook pages of several black nationalist organizations, including the NBPP, Mauricelm-Lei Millere and African American Defense League, who according to the Southern Poverty Law Center may have radicalized Johnson. Quanell X, the leader of the NBPP in Houston, Texas, said Johnson had been a member of that city&#x27;s chapter several years earlier, for about six months. He also said Johnson had been asked to leave the group for espousing dangerous rhetoric and violating the organization&#x27;s &quot;chain of command&quot;, and that Johnson questioned NBPP&#x27;s tactics, asking why they had not purchased more weapons and ammunition. In a written statement, the NBPP said Johnson was not a member of the organization and that &quot;a simple like ... via a social media website does not represent membership, affiliation, or endorsement. It simply is what it is ... a like on the page.&quot;

== Criticism ==
===Criticism by former members of the original Black Panther Party===
The Huey P. Newton Foundation issued a news release denouncing the New Black Panther Party. Its release read in part:

Bobby Seale, one of the co-founding members of the Black Panther Party, also spoke out against the New Black Panther Party. In a 2010 interview, he called the group&#x27;s rhetoric xenophobic and described its leaders&#x27; remarks as &quot;absurd, racial, [and] categorical&quot;.

Reacting to a video of two NBPP members positioned outside of a polling place on Election Day in 2008 in Philadelphia, Seale agreed with &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; anchor Kyra Phillips &quot;to some degree&quot; that the incident was voter intimidation. He also described what he saw as significant differences between the original Black Panthers and the New Black Panthers, particularly between their respective Ten-Point Programs.

===2002 intimidation of original Panthers===
In April 2002, an event was held in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the creation of the Black Panther Party. Ron Scott, a co-founder of the Detroit chapter of the Panthers, was a guest speaker, and many in attendance were also original members of the Black Panther Party. During the course of the night, the event was interrupted by 30 members of the New Black Panther Party dressed in motorcycle helmets and steel-capped boots, led by Malik Zulu Shabazz. Shabazz and his NBPP member seized control of the event and ordered under threat of violence that the original Panthers cease criticism of the New Panthers.

===2015 assault of Dhoruba Bin Wahad===
On August 19, 2015, Dhoruba Bin Wahad (a member of the original Black Panther Party) and an associate were assaulted by a faction of the New Black Panther Party. Bin Wahad had been attending a conference in Atlanta, Georgia held by the Nzinga faction of the &quot;New&quot; Panthers. Bin Wahad confronted the group about their adoption of the Black Panther name and their rhetoric. The two were ordered to leave but when they refused, Bin Wahad was assaulted. Wahad was left with a concussion, a broken jaw and lacerations from the attack. The event led founding member of the original Black Panthers, Elbert &quot;Big Man&quot; Howard, to denounce the group as &quot;reactionaries&quot; and &quot;thugs&quot;.

<doc id="230812" wikidata="Q1431823" url="?curid=230812" title="Private Pluto">
<text>Private Pluto is a 1943 propaganda comedy cartoon produced by Walt Disney Productions. In this cartoon, Pluto is in the army and he gets antagonized by two chipmunks, later known as Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, in their first official appearance. While the chipmunks became regular antagonists of Donald Duck, they did continue to pester Pluto in &quot;Squatter&#x27;s Rights&quot; (1946) and one last time in &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Christmas Tree&quot; (1952).

This story and characters previously appeared in the October 1942 issue of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;. This was a 4-page text story with illustrations.

==Plot==
This short showcases Pluto as a military working dog during the World War II when he is a guard dog on a U.S military base. He is told there are saboteurs, and is assigned to guard a pill-box (gun emplacement). First, Pluto tries to follow marching orders, contorting himself into quite a mess. Then, he engages in hijinks with two chipmunks who are using a cannon to store and crack their nuts, and a war of wits naturally ensues.

==Voice cast==
* Pluto: Pinto Colvig
* Chip: Norma Swank
* Dale: Dessie Flynn

==Home media==
The short was released on May 18, 2004, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Walt Disney on the Front Lines&quot; and on December 7 of the same year, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Pluto: 1930–1947&quot;.

<doc id="230814" wikidata="Q1239547" url="?curid=230814" title="Three-sided football">
<text>Three-sided football (often referred to as 3SF) is a variation of association football played with three teams instead of the usual two. Played on a hexagonal pitch, the game can be adapted to other versions of football.

Unlike conventional football, where the winner is determined by the highest scoring of the three teams, the winner in three-sided football is the team that concedes the fewest goals.

It was devised by the Danish Situationist Asger Jorn to explain his notion of triolectics, which was his refinement on the Marxian concept of dialectics, as well as to disrupt everyone&#x27;s general idea of football.

== History ==
The first known game of 3SF, played on Friday 28 May 1993, was organized by the London Psychogeographical Association on Glasgow Green as part of the Glasgow Anarchist Summer School. Participants included Richard Essex, Stewart Home and the members of The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture.

Three-sided football has been practiced in various training sessions of the Association of Autonomous Astronauts in England, France, Italy and Austria, including the 1st Intergalactic Conference in Vienna (1997), the 2nd Intergalactic Conference in Bologna (1998), the Space 1999 in London, or as a protest event in Parc de La Villette during the 1998 two-sided football World Cup in Paris.

The Deptford Three Sided Football Club (D3FC) was founded in February 2012 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Jorn&#x27;s invention of the game in his 1962 book Naturens Orden. Games were held every other Sunday between D3FC and other local clubs at the Deptford Green Hexagon in Fordham Park, South East London.

From 2013 to 2021 the Sports Organization &quot;Futbol 3 Colombia - F3C&quot; has been conducting Three Sided Football (soccer 3) tournaments in public parks and universities in Bogotá - Colombia for children and young people (men and women) of low income and vulnerable. The Three Sided Football matches are held in various public parks such as: Servita Park, La Gaitana Park, Ciudad Montes Park, and since 2018 every Saturday in the Normandía neighborhood park in the city of Bogotá (https://futbol3colombia.jimdofree.com/)

The first three-sided football match in Turkey was organized by InEnArt on 14 September 2013, to coincide with the 13th Istanbul Biennial. The match was played in front of Kadir Has University, Istanbul between Philosophy Football FC from the UK, FSC Dynamo Windrad Kassel from Germany and Ayazma FC from Turkey. The referee was Halil İbrahim Dinçdağ, who was suspended by the Turkish Football Federation in 2009 because of his sexuality. Geoff Andrews, manager of Philosophy Football FC, launched the International Three Sided Football Federation before this match.

The first three sided football match in Australia was held on 4 May 2014. It was held at St Kilda Primary School in Melbourne and featured the St Kilda All Sartres, Pythagoras 3FC (the Pys) and Atletico Geometry (the Geometers). The teams were mixed - an important feature of Australian Three Sided Football.

== 3SF World Cup ==

=== Silkeborg, 2014 ===
The first 3SF World Cup took place in cooperation with the International Three Sided Football Federation and the Museum Jorn in Silkeborg, Denmark, 23 May until 25 May 2014. Teams from France, Germany, Poland, England, Lithuania and Denmark sought to win the Cup. The Danish team Silkeborg KFUM were crowned champions.

=== Kassel, 2017 ===
The second 3SF World Cup was held at the Hessenkampfbahn in Kassel, Germany on Sat 19 August 2017. The tournament was hosted by Dynamo Windrad as part of documenta 14 and featured twelve teams originating from Germany, England, Poland and Lithuania.

The final was contested between local side F2 Versenkt and two teams from the SE London league, Polish Husaria and New Cross Internationals. In a very tight and tactical game, New Cross Internationals scored the only goal of the game against F2 Versenkt. Although Polish Husaria and New Cross Internationals both finished the game with clean sheets, the rules of the tournament stated that in cases of a winning draw the team who scored the most goals in the match would be considered the winner. Therefore, New Cross Internationals were declared winners of the tournament.

After the final it transpired that Polish Husaria had not been aware of the rule regarding goals scored, and because of this New Cross Internationals offered to share the title with Polish Husaria.

=== London, 2020 ===
The next 3SF World Cup was scheduled to be held in London in 2020, however, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Domestic leagues ==

=== Deptford 3SF League (New Cross, South East London) ===
In September 2014 Deptford Three Sided Football Club embarked on a new experiment in triolectics by establishing a formal league structure with five other teams from the local area. The inaugural teams involved in the league were Aesthetico Athletico, New Cross Irregulars 3FC, Philosophy Football Club, Polsky Budowlancy (now named Husaria), Strategic Optimists Football Club and, of course, Deptford Three Sided Football Club.[17]

==== 2014–15 ====
The inaugural season ended on 7 June 2015 with New Cross Irregulars being awarded the trophy, having mathematically won the title in the penultimate game of the season.

==== 2015–16 ====
The same six teams played in the 2015–16 season. It was decided on the final game of the season, with Husaria, Aesthetico Athletico and New Cross Irregulars 3FC playing each other in a match where all three teams could win the title. Defending champions NXI were taken out of contention early on, conceding 5 goals in total, and Husaria were crowned new champions courtesy of a single goal against Aesthetico.

NXI, Aesthetico and Strategic Optimists all ended in joint second place, a single point behind winners Husaria.

==== 2016–17 ====
NXI reclaimed the league title in the penultimate game of the season on 7 May 2017 with a win over Deptford and Aesthetico.

Up to this point Husaria still had a chance of defending their title, but they came second in their May match to concede the point that handed the league to NXI.

=== Triball (London Bridge, South London) ===
In January 2017 the first season of the Triball 3SF league was established. Duplicating the Deptford points structure for the league table, Triball is played in a 4-a-side format between seven league teams. The league also hosts a cup competition called the Triball Open Cup.

== Tournaments ==
On 31 October 2009, a three-sided football competition was organised in Lyon during the Biennale d&#x27;art contemporain de Lyon. The subversive event was a confrontation of the non spectacular sense of the original game with the main title of the Biennale, Le Spectacle du Quoditidien. The manifestation took place in Stade Laurent Gérin, Vénissieux and was organised by Pied La Biche association.[2]

In an event called &quot;Thinking Football&quot;, aiming to reflect on the role of football in modern society, the Athletic de Bilbao Foundation organised among other things a three-sided football championship taking place from October 2011 to April 2012 with 37 participant teams.

== Exhibition matches ==
In August 2009, a three-sided football game was played in Alytus as part of the Art Strike events there. Stewart Home acted as referee.

In the run-up to the 2010 UK General Election, a three-sided football game was played on 2 May 2010 in Haggerston Park, with each team representing one of the main political parties. This match was organised by Whitechapel Gallery in conjunction with Philosophy Football FC. The match was won by Philosophy Football FC, representing Labour, who conceded no goals to the Conservatives&#x27; 2 and Lib Dems&#x27; 3.[4] Philosophy Football FC later organised and competed in the first ever three-sided football match to be played in Spain, on 7 May 2011, which was discussed by journalist Sid Lowe in the &quot;Guardian&quot;&#x27;s football podcast. Lowe&#x27;s team won 3-5-5.

== 3SF in South London ==
Home to two different Three-sided football leagues, South London hosts an active community of 3SF, mostly played in New Cross at Fordham Park, and London Bridge at Tabard Gardens.

== Three Sided Football Stadium ==
In 2017, Essex based architect Adam Leatherbarrow entered a Non-Architecture competition to showcase a conceptual design for a Three Sided Football Stadium. The design was based on pitch parameters, UEFA stadium guidance documents and inspired by German football stadia. The Stadium comprises six single tier stands and infilled with triangular seating to chamfer the hexagonal shape. The design was recognised by TalkSport&#x27;s &quot;The Late Tackle Podcast&quot; where Adam gave an interview.

Shortly after the interview, Leatherbarrow&#x27;s stadium concept featured in the June 2017 edition of Four Four Two magazine Titled &quot;A Game of Three Halves&quot;. Adam stated &quot;Something has got to be purpose-built, because I really hope the sport kicks off. Just imagine a game between West Ham, Chelsea and Spurs - it would be mad!&quot;

<doc id="230818" wikidata="Q2414737" url="?curid=230818" title="USS Austin (LPD-4)">
<text>The third USS &quot;Austin&quot; (LPD-4) was the lead ship of her class of amphibious transport dock ships in the United States Navy. &quot;Austin&quot; was named in honor of the city of Austin, Texas which in turn was named in honor of Stephen F. Austin, a Texian patriot during the Texas War for Independence and the first Secretary of State of the Republic of Texas.

&quot;Austin&quot; was laid down on 4 February 1963 at Brooklyn, New York, by the New York Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 27 June 1964 (sponsored by Miss Lynda Bird Johnson, the daughter of President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson), and commissioned on 6 February 1965.

== 1960s ==

The amphibious transport dock remained at Brooklyn through May, then sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, on 26 May to complete her outfitting. During September and October, she was engaged in shakedown training in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. The ship then made a port call at Corpus Christi, Texas, before returning to her home port of Norfolk in November.

From November 1965 through April 1966, &quot;Austin&quot; operated in the Norfolk area before entering the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 5 May for repairs and alterations. When this work was completed, she headed for the Caribbean to conduct two weeks of trials off Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. The ship next sailed to the Dominican Republic to assist in the withdrawal of units of the Inter-American Peace Force which had helped restore stability during a political crisis. These units were disembarked at Sunny Point, North Carolina, on 9 August, and she then returned, via Norfolk, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she arrived on 21 August for adjustments to her main propulsion plant. On 3 November &quot;Austin&quot; returned to Norfolk.

She spent the next four and one-half months in preparation for an extended deployment as a unit of the Caribbean Amphibious Ready Group. On 15 April 1967, &quot;Austin&quot; touched at Morehead City, North Carolina, to embark United States Marine Corps units and then proceeded to the Caribbean. While there, she participated in numerous amphibious training exercises and made port visits at Ponce, Puerto Rico, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, Willemstad, Netherlands Antilles, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Colón, Panama, and Guantánamo Bay. The vessel returned her marines to Morehead City on 17 August and arrived at Norfolk on 19 August for a leave and upkeep period. She got underway again on 4 November to become a part of the recovery force for the Apollo 4 space mission. From 13 to 16 November, &quot;Austin&quot; held amphibious training exercises, then returned to Norfolk for the holidays.

She sailed on 8 January 1968 to carry naval personnel and equipment to Key West, Florida. After continuing on to Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, the ship arrived back in Norfolk 25 January. During February, March, and April, she took part in several training exercises along the east coast. On 13 May, another cruise to the Caribbean began which included visits to Bermuda, Nassau, Bahamas, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Key West, Florida. The vessel briefly returned to Norfolk on 3 June and then retraced her route to take part in Operation Race Run at Vieques Island. &quot;Austin&quot; was back in home port on 30 June and entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 19 July for an overhaul.

Refresher training at Guantánamo Bay in late January 1969 was followed by two weeks of amphibious warfare training in the Virginia Capes area. In April, &quot;Austin&quot; took part in special amphibious exercises before beginning another deployment to the Caribbean on 18 May. During the four-month cruise, she was involved in Operation Exotic Dancer II, held off Puerto Rico and visits included San Juan and Roosevelt Roads, La Guaira, Venezuela; Colón, Panama; Guantánamo Bay; Bridgetown, Barbados; and St. Thomas. This deployment ended on 10 September, and the ship began a period of leave and upkeep at Norfolk. She sailed again on 4 November as a recovery ship in support of the Apollo 12 spaceshot and remained on station until 24 November when she began the voyage back to Norfolk. &quot;Austin&quot; made a brief stop at Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 29–30 November and arrived at Norfolk on 6 December.

== 1970s ==

&quot;Austin&quot; spent the first two and one-half months of 1970 in port, before sailing on 17 March with Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 2 for the Mediterranean. The deployment included amphibious landing exercises and stops at Rota, Spain, and Málaga, Spain, Genoa, Italy, and Naples, Italy, Cannes, France, and Valletta, Malta. &quot;Austin&quot; lost her stern gate on 6 June, and temporary repairs were made at Malta from 16 to 30 June. The ship arrived back in Norfolk on 13 July to begin a yard period for permanent repairs. She emerged from the shipyard on 22 September and began refresher training. &quot;Austin&quot; again deployed with PhibRon 2 on 16 November. During the cruise, &quot;Austin&quot; held numerous amphibious and antisubmarine warfare exercises. She also visited Genoa, Livorno, and Naples, Italy, Barcelona and Rota, Spain, Mersin, Turkey, and Athens, Greece. On 7 May 1971, &quot;Austin&quot; ended the cruise at Norfolk.

The ship got underway again on 14 July for operations in conjunction with the recovery of the Apollo 15 space capsule.

The first two weeks in August were spent in naval mine countermeasures exercises held in the area of Charleston, South Carolina. &quot;Austin&quot; then entered a period of type training and amphibious exercises followed by more mine warfare exercises in early November. She returned to Norfolk on 12 November for the holidays.

&quot;Austin&quot; began 1972 with Exercise Snowy Beach, a large-scale landing exercise held off the coast of Maine. From 15 February to 20 March, she participated in Operation Springboard in the Caribbean. The ship visited the United States Naval Academy from 17 to 20 April to hold indoctrination tours for midshipmen. During the next two months, she conducted type training and took part in Exercises &quot;Exotic Dancer&quot;, and &quot;Escort Tiger.&quot; On 5 July, the vessel unloaded all ammunition in preparation for overhaul. She entered the Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Baltimore, Maryland, on 11 July. Work continued there until 11 October, when she was towed to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for completion of the yard work.

On 15 March 1973, &quot;Austin&quot; began post-repair trials. She sailed to Guantánamo Bay on 22 March and, after refresher training, returned to Norfolk 24 April. After another two months of preparation, the vessel sailed on 7 June for another Mediterranean deployment. Her ports of call included Alicante, Barcelona, and Rota, Spain; Trieste and Venice, Italy, and Corfu, Athens, and Rhodes, Greece. She took part in several exercises, including NATO Exercise &quot;Deep Furrow&quot;, from 18 September to 4 October. On 10 October, &quot;Austin&quot; got underway for Souda Bay, Crete, as a part of the Sixth Fleet response to the Yom Kippur War. In early December, she began the trip back to Norfolk. After pausing briefly at Morehead City on 19 December, she arrived at Norfolk the next day for post-deployment standdown.

The ship got underway on 8 February 1974 for Guantánamo Bay as a unit of the Caribbean Amphibious Ready Group. She operated from various points in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands through August. In early September, &quot;Austin&quot; visited Caracas, Venezuela, and Willemstad, Netherlands Antilles. While in Curaçao, 154 Dutch marines were embarked for Exercise &quot;Doria Salute VII.&quot; The marines disembarked at Vieques Island; then &quot;Austin&quot; returned to Norfolk (via San Juan, Aruba, and Curaçao) on 19 March. However, she headed back toward the Caribbean on 24 April. The first country visited was Panama, where marines disembarked for jungle warfare training. Her subsequent ports of call included Cartagena, Colombia, Vieques, Puerto Rico, and St. John&#x27;s, Antigua and Barbuda. From 25 May to 2 June, &quot;Austin&quot; was back in Norfolk for upkeep. She resumed duty on 30 October by sailing to the Canal Zone. The ship continued her routine of shuttling marines and their equipment between various Caribbean ports through 16 December, when she arrived back at Norfolk.

On 25 February 1975, &quot;Austin&quot; deployed once more to the Mediterranean and carried out amphibious training exercises and midshipmen training cruises in that area, visiting ports in Spain, Italy, and France before returning to Norfolk on 20 August. She then began an extended period of availability.

The ship got underway on 14 January 1976 to load ammunition and sailed a week later for the Caribbean. After a brief training period at Guantánamo Bay, she continued on to Curaçao. From 4–16 February, &quot;Austin&quot; took part in Exercise &quot;Rum Punch 76&quot;. She was back in home port on 21 February for upkeep.

For the next four months, the amphibious transport dock was involved in a series of inspections, training exercises, and Naval Reserve training cruises. On 9 June, she returned briefly to the Caribbean and then made a short visit to New York City in early July. &quot;Austin&quot; was back in Norfolk on 10 July and began preparations for overseas movement. She sailed on 20 August for northern Europe. Her ports of call during the cruise included Ørland, Norway; Edinburgh, Scotland; Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands; Esbjerg, Denmark; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Bremerhaven, Germany, and Portsmouth, England. After a stop at Morehead City to disembark marines she arrived in Norfolk on 11 November.

The ship went to Yorktown, Virginia, on 17 January 1977 to unload ammunition prior to her scheduled overhaul. She proceeded to Baltimore on 2 February and commenced overhaul at the Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. The work was finished on 16 February 1978, and &quot;Austin&quot; returned the next day to Norfolk. After a brief stay, she sailed to Guantánamo Bay for refresher training, but was back in Norfolk on 25 April. After several months of training, the vessel got underway 22 August for the north Atlantic. There she took part in Operation Northern Wedding, in conjunction with other NATO naval units, and made stops in Norway, Denmark, and England, before returning to Norfolk 31 October.

== 1980s ==

&quot;Austin&quot; sailed on 30 January 1980 for another Mediterranean deployment. On her first stop during this trip, she supported USMC and Portuguese Fuzileiros combined arms operations. Next, she made a port call in Lisbon, and a supply stop in Rota, Spain. After leaving Rota and passing through the Straits of Gibraltar, at approximately 0125, with the C.O. resting in his stateroom, she plowed into a large container ship thirty miles off the coast of Spain, avoiding capsizing and all-hands-lost by mere seconds. She limped into Cartagena Spain. The marines (3/8) on board were moved to the other ships in the fleet, and &quot;Austin&quot; cruised to Athens, Greece for repairs. Once repaired, the ship stopped in Naples, Genoa, and Venice, Italy. The ship returned to her home port on 11 July. After a brief respite, she sailed for South America on 15 October and participated in Operation Unites, and Operation Allied Caribe 80. The warship took part in an amphibious operation with Brazilian naval forces. Operation Allied Caribe 80 was held in the Antilles in conjunction with units from the United Kingdom, Canada and the Netherlands. &quot;Austin&quot; later provided hurricane relief assistance to the inhabitants of Dominica. The ship returned to Norfolk 7 December, and she continued operations from that port into 1981.

On 3 February 1981, &quot;Austin&quot; put to sea from Norfolk on her way to Morehead City to embark Marine Corps units. From Morehead City, she headed for the Arctic Circle near Norway where she participated in cold weather training. The warship returned to Norfolk on 17 April and resumed normal operations out of that port. Late in June, she voyaged south and west to the gulf coast of Florida to perform a special project for the Chief of Naval Operations. During the trip home, &quot;Austin&quot; visited Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Nassau, Bahamas. Arriving back at Norfolk on 8 July, she resumed a normal schedule of operations until the beginning of September when she entered the yard at the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Company to begin an 11-month overhaul.

&quot;Austin&quot; completed the repair period on 2 August 1982 and spent most of the remainder of the year undergoing post-overhaul inspections and examinations at Norfolk. She began 1983 with a cruise to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to conduct post-overhaul refresher training. During the early part of February, the warship took an extended break from training to make a 12-day port visit to New Orleans, Louisiana, for the Mardi Gras festival. &quot;Austin&quot; resumed refresher training on 19 February and concluded it 1 March. In March and early April, she operated out of Norfolk and then spent the last three weeks of April in port preparing to deploy to the troubled eastern Mediterranean. On 5 May &quot;Austin&quot; set sail for Morehead City where she embarked the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines (BLT 1/8), and the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU 24) before heading out across the Atlantic.

The warship arrived in the Mediterranean late in May and disembarked the Marine Corps units at Beirut, Lebanon, where a guerilla-style civil war among a virtual rainbow of factions complicated by military incursions on the parts of Syria and Israel, had been in progress at varying levels of intensity for some time. In September 1982, the assassination of President-elect Bachir Gemayel touched off atrocities that brought a multinational peacekeeping force into the country soon thereafter. In May 1983, the marines of BLT 1/8 and MAU 24 replaced the part of that force protecting Beirut International Airport. &quot;Austin, &quot;for her part, remained in the vicinity providing support for the troops, anchoring nearby during the day and steaming out to sea at night.

As tense as the situation in Lebanon was, ship and marines quickly settled into a routine. Too quickly perhaps, for on 23 October 1983, a terrorist shattered that routine when he drove an explosives-laden truck into the lobby of the headquarters of the Marine Corps units stationed ashore. The detonation of the mobile bomb destroyed the headquarters, killed 241 men and injured over 100 others. &quot;Austin&quot; responded to the emergency quickly by providing men to stand security watches and help in the search for survivors. In November, the amphibious transport dock departed the eastern Mediterranean and began the voyage home. On 7 December, she disembarked the remnants of BLT 1/8 and MAU 24 at Morehead City. The following day &quot;Austin&quot; put into port at Little Creek, Virginia, and began post-deployment leave and upkeep.

The warship remained in port at Little Creek for the first six weeks of 1984. On 13 February, she put to sea to participate in a minesweeping exercise off the coast of North Carolina before heading for Scandinavian waters. During the Atlantic transit and during her time in the Arctic waters near Norway, &quot;Austin&quot; and other Navy warships joined elements of the navies of Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom in conducting the two-part NATO Exercise &quot;United Effort Teamwork &#x27;84.&quot;

Following the conclusion of the exercise, the amphibious transport dock made ceremonial visits to ports in Norway, the Netherlands, and in the United Kingdom. She returned to Little Creek on 28 April after a brief stop at Morehead City to disembark marines and unload their equipment.

In June, at the conclusion of the usual post-deployment stand down, &quot;Austin&quot; embarked upon a schedule of normal operations along the east coast. That employment occupied her time for the remainder of 1984 and during the first half of 1985. On 2 July 1985, she made the brief voyage to Morehead City where she embarked Marine Corps units and their equipment for another tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet. The amphibious transport dock arrived in Rota, Spain, on 13 July and entered the Mediterranean Sea the following day. While the problems in Lebanon continued, direct American military involvement there had ceased. The Austin was involved in the hijacking of the Achilles Lauro Italian cruise ship..did 45 days underway, Thus &quot;Austin&quot; accomplished her 1985 Mediterranean deployment in a more routine fashion. It consisted of bilateral and multilateral exercises punctuated by visits to ports throughout the Mediterranean. She completed turnover procedures at Rota, Spain, 4–7 December and then put to sea for the voyage home. &quot;Austin&quot; stopped at Morehead City on 18–19 December to disembark marines and stood into Norfolk on 20 December.

In January 1986, the amphibious transport dock began a restricted availability at pierside in Norfolk. She finished repairs late in April and resumed normal operations out of Norfolk. &quot;Austin&quot; pursued those activities until the middle of August. She departed Norfolk 12 August and, after embarking Marine Corps units at Morehead City the next day, set sail for northern Europe and another series of exercises with forces of other NATO nations. The cruise – highlighted by visits to Germany, and England – lasted through the first week in October. On 8 October, &quot;Austin&quot; stood out of Dover, England, and sailed back to the United States.

In September 1987, &quot;Austin&quot; was part of LF6F 1-89/22d MEU (HMM-162, BLT 318, and MSSG-22). The group was part of a Mediterranean deployment. &quot;Austin&quot; embarked elements of 3d Battalion, 8th Marines from Camp Lejeune (primarily Kilo Company) at Morehead City on 29 September 1987. &quot;Austin&quot; and 22d MEU participated in Operations Sierra de Retin, Phinia 89, Noble Shirley, and the NATO exercise Dragon Hammer in Sardinia, returning to Morehead City 18 March 1988. The Austin visited Rota and Cartagena, Spain, Marseille and Toulon, France, Naples, Italy, Antalya, Turkey, and Haifa, Israel.

== 1990s ==
The &quot;Austin&quot; played an important role during the Iraqi War. In late 1990 &quot;Austin&quot; was undergoing maintenance, which was stopped short due to the impending Gulf War and the &quot;Austin&quot; redeployed. In January 1991 inchoped in Rota for turnover with and proceeded into the Mediterranean. While there, &quot;Austin&quot; conducted exercises with other countries before the call came to support Operation Provide Comfort. &quot;Austin&quot;, and all assisted in this mission with one port of call for liberty in Haifa, Israel. The MARG (Marine Amphibious Readiness Group) was extended by two weeks while they waited to back load Marines who were in northern Iraq. On 7 August 1991, &quot;Austin&quot; pulled into Morehead City to offload Marines, and returned to Norfolk on 8 August for post deployment stand down. In November, &quot;Austin&quot; entered Metro Machine for dry dock repairs and maintenance. In April 1992, &quot;Austin&quot; returned to Norfolk to finish repairs and prepare for subsequent work ups and prepared to redeploy in 1993.

In late October 1990 the USS Austin supported Marines in Operation Sharp Edge, the non-combatant evacuation and defense of the US Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia. In January 1991 the Austin returned to the Mediterranean.

In late 1994 she was given a refit after returning form the Mediterranean and was assigned to Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage. The ship was too wide to traverse the Panama Canal. In the early part of 1995 the Austin went to Guantanamo to begin service to that mission. She was on the mission for 30 days before returning to Norfolk, Virginia.

== 2000s ==

In 2002–2003 &quot;Austin&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean in support of operations in Kosovo, as well as providing support to marines as they deployed to Kenya for humanitarian aid operations and Djibouti as the marines provided security for Predator UAV airbases. They then deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

In May 2005, &quot;Austin&quot; set sail from Naval Base Norfolk. to Port-au-Prince, Haiti in order to pick up National Guard and Army Corps of Engineers troops who were responsible for providing humanitarian aid and completing numerous public works projects in and around the city of Port-au-Prince. After roughly a week anchored off the coast of Haiti, the &quot;Austin&quot; set sail for Guantánamo Bay (GITMO), Cuba. After about a week at Guantánamo Bay, &quot;Austin&quot; set sail for St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. After nearly a month away from her homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, the &quot;Austin&quot; and her crew returned home. &quot;Austin&quot;″s final deployment was from November 2005 – May 2006. &quot;Austin&quot; transported Marines to the Persian Gulf and provided support during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

== Decommissioning ==

&quot;Austin&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Station Norfolk on 27 September 2006. After the ceremonies, she was taken in tow by to be taken to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 30 September 2009, a contract to dismantle &quot;Austin&quot; was issued to International Shipbreaking Ltd, Brownsville, Texas, where scrapping was completed on 10 September 2010. The anchor and bell of &quot;Austin&quot; is now on display at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, in the Building 92 visitor center which includes a museum about the Yard&#x27;s history.

<doc id="230825" wikidata="Q9285562" url="?curid=230825" title="Haxey Hood">
<text>The Haxey Hood is a traditional event in Haxey, North Lincolnshire, England. It consists of a game in which a large rugby scrum (the &quot;sway&quot;) pushes a leather tube (the &quot;hood&quot;) to one of four pubs in the town, where it remains until the following year&#x27;s game. The game is played on 6 January, the Twelfth Day of Christmas (unless the 6th falls on a Sunday, in which case the event is held on the Saturday).

==History==

Haxey, Upperthorpe and Westwoodside lie in an area of North Lincolnshire known as the Isle of Axholme. The official story is that in the 14th century, Lady de Mowbray, wife of an Isle landowner, John De Mowbray, was out riding towards Westwoodside on the hill that separates it from Haxey. As she went over the hill her silk riding hood was blown away by the wind. Thirteen farm workers in the field rushed to help and chased the hood all over the field. It was finally caught by one of the farm workers, but being too shy to hand it back to the lady, he gave it to one of the others to hand back to her. She thanked the farm worker who had returned the hood and said that he had acted like a Lord, whereas the worker who had actually caught the hood was a Fool. So amused was she by this act of chivalry and the resulting chase, that she donated of land on condition that the chase for the hood would be re-enacted each year. This re-enactment over the centuries has become known as &quot;The Haxey Hood&quot;.
In folklore, when a custom is too old for its origins to be remembered, a story is often devised to rationalise what would otherwise be baffling. However the &quot;official&quot; story of the Hood&#x27;s origins is not that unlikely. Others have noted possible similarities between the Hood and hoods worn by bog burials in Northern Europe and noted that the game takes place on the border of bogs where naturally-preserved mummies of supposed prehistoric sacrifices have been found. However, hoods have been found on deposited bodies in Scandinavia but not in Britain or in Ireland.

The nobles mentioned in the story did exist. Records show that John De Mowbray (29 November 1310 – 4 October 1361), the 3rd Baron Mowbray of Axholme, would be the most likely candidate for the husband of the lady. This would date the Hood to about 1359 when a deed granting land to commoners was enacted by the baron. This would make the Hood around 650 years old, making it likely to be the oldest surviving tradition in England.

It has similarities to other village combats, such as Ashbourne&#x27;s Royal Shrovetide Football, the Shrove Tuesday Football Games in Sedgefield, Durham and Alnwick, Northumberland and the Hallaton Bottle Kicking contest in Leicestershire.

The song &quot;Drink Old England Dry&quot; (Roud 882) is associated with the hood and has only rarely been recorded elsewhere.

==Preparations==
In the weeks before the event, the Fool and the Boggins tour nearby villages in order to collect money (traditionally to pay for the event, but now to raise money for local charities). Traditionally they sing a number of well-known folk songs including &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, &quot;Cannons (Drink England Dry)&quot; and &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Boy&quot;. All wear their full festival costumes, the only exception being that the Fool&#x27;s face is not marked.

At 12 noon, work in the parish comes to a standstill and people start to make their way to Haxey village to gather and take part in the traditional ritual. At about 12:30 the officials start a tour of the ale houses involved, and drink free drinks at each pub, provided by the landlord as a token of good luck to try to bring the Hood its way. Many people follow this tour and consider it a vital part of the day. They start at the Carpenters Arms where they sing the traditional folk songs and ceremoniously paint the Fool&#x27;s face. Then they move to the Kings Arms and then up towards the church, taking in the Loco and the Duke William on the way, drinking and singing as they go. Around 2:30 pm the officials leave the Duke and process up to the church.
The Fool leads the procession and has the right to kiss any woman on the way. Once at the green in front of the Parish Church, at around 2:30, the Fool makes his traditional speech of welcome standing on an old mounting block in front of the church known as the Mowbray Stone. During this speech a fire is lit with damp straw behind him. The smoke rises up and around him and this is known as &quot;Smoking the Fool&quot;. This is a watered-down version of the earlier custom (abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century due to its obvious danger) in which a more substantial fire was lit with damp straw beneath a tree. The Fool was then suspended over the fire and swung back and forth until he was almost suffocated before being cut down and dropped into the fire, from where he had to make his escape as best he could. The Fool finishes his speech with the traditional words that the crowd chant along with him. They are: &quot;hoose agen hoose, toon agen toon, if a man meets a man knock &#x27;im doon, but doan&#x27;t &#x27;ot &#x27;im,&quot; which translates as: &quot;house against house, town against town, if a man meets a man, knock him down but don&#x27;t hurt him.&quot;

The Towns mentioned are the villages of Westwoodside and Haxey, and Houses are the public houses (pubs) of those villages.
The pubs are:
*The Carpenters Arms – Newbigg, Westwoodside
*Duke William Hotel since 1730 – Church Street, Haxey
*The Loco – 31 Church Street, Haxey
*The Kings Arms – Low Street, Haxey

After the speech, the Fool leads the crowd to the middle of a field where the game is to be played.

==Venue==

Haxey is a large parish on the southern border of the Isle of Axholme. It consists of the villages of Haxey and Westwoodside with the hamlets of High Burnham, Low Burnham, East Lound and Graizelound. In earlier days, Westwoodside was divided into Park, Newbigg, Nethergate, Upperthorpe (or Overthorpe) and Commonside.

==Playing the game==

The thirteen characters from the original story are represented as follows: there is the Lord, the Fool and eleven Boggins, one of the Boggins being the chief Boggin.

The Lord and chief Boggin are dressed in hunting pink (red) coats and top hats decorated with flowers and badges. The Lord also carries his wand of office. This is a staff made from twelve willow wands with one more upside down in the centre. These are bound thirteen times with willow twigs and a red ribbon at the top. The thirteen willow wands are supposed to represent the twelve apostles and the upside down one represents Judas. The staff is supposed to represent the sword and the blood from when the game was played with a bullock&#x27;s head after it had been slaughtered. The Fool has multi-coloured strips of material attached to his trousers and top. He wears a feathered hat decorated with flowers and rags, and his face is smeared with soot and red ochre. He carries a whip and sock filled with bran, with which he belabours anyone who comes within reach. The remaining ten Boggins wear red jumpers. The game is played by locals, although anyone can join in. There are no official teams, but everyone involved tries to push the Hood towards their favoured pub. 
Proceedings start at around 3pm with the throwing of twelve Sack Hoods. These are rolled hessian sacks sewn up to prevent them unrolling. This is a prequel to the main game, mainly for children. The youngsters in the crowd run for them when thrown and attempt to get them off the field. If they are tackled then they must immediately throw it in the air unless the challenger is a Boggin in which case the hood is ‘boggined’ and it is returned to the Lord who starts it off again.

The first two or three of these are stopped by the Boggins on the edge of the field and the hoods returned to the Lord. After a while the Boggins let the Sack Hoods be taken off the field in which case they can be returned later for a cash reward, currently two pounds.

After this bit of fun to warm up the crowd the Sway Hood is then thrown up in the air. The rugby type scrum (or Sway to give it its official title) then converges on the Hood and the game starts in earnest. The idea is to get the Sway Hood into one of the four pubs in either Haxey or Westwoodside.

The Hood, which cannot be thrown or run with, is moved slowly by &#x27;swaying&#x27;, that is pushing and pulling the Hood and people within the &#x27;Sway&#x27; toward the direction of their pub. Although everyone is trying to push in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams. The Sway makes very slow progress, as it snakes around, stopping quite often when it collapses, in order to pull bodies out, that became crushed into the mud. Safety is of prime concern and the whole thing is supervised by the Boggins. The Lord is referee and sees that the game is played fairly. At any one time there are usually around 200 people in the Sway and about one thousand people watching. Games can last anything from a couple of hours onwards and have been known to go on well into the night. Everything in the path of the Sway goes down before it, including hedges and walls. Another of the Boggins&#x27; jobs is to stop the Sway destroying everything in its path.

Nobody parks on the roads where the Sway may go, and with good reason. In 2002, a couple of drivers parked opposite the Duke William. The Sway headed right for them and pushed one of the cars 10 feet down the road and into the other.

The game ends when the Hood arrives at one of the pubs and is touched by the landlord from his front step. The landlord then takes charge of the Hood for the year, and is supposed to give everyone a free drink. The winning pub pours beer over the Hood and then hangs it behind the bar (each pub has two hooks especially for this purpose). According to legend, it used to be roasted on a spit over the pub fire having been doused with ale, which was then drunk by those present.

The Hood hangs in the winning pub until New Year&#x27;s Eve when it is collected by the Boggins in time for the next game.

<text>Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories, sometimes abbreviated WDC&amp;S, is an American anthology comic book series featuring characters from The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s films and shorts, including Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Mickey Mouse, Chip &#x27;n Dale, Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf, Scamp, Bucky Bug, Grandma Duck, Brer Rabbit, Winnie the Pooh, and others. With more than 700 issues, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics &amp; Stories&quot; is the longest-running Disney comic book in the United States, making it the flagship title, and is one of the best-selling comic books of all time.

The book was originally published by Dell Comics (1940–1962), and there have been many revivals over the years, continuing the same legacy numbering. The revivals have been published by Gold Key Comics (1962–1984), Gladstone Publishing (1986–1990), Disney Comics (1990–1993), back to Gladstone Publishing (1993–1999), Gemstone Publishing (2003–2008), Boom! Studios (2009–2011) and IDW Publishing (2015–2020).

==Publication history==

The precursor to WDC was &quot;Mickey Mouse Magazine&quot;, published in several incarnations from 1933 to 1940. WDC itself was launched in October 1940, and initially consisted of reprints taken from the Disney comic strips &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, and &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;, reformatted for comic books and colored. The first original story created for WDC was an adaptation of &quot;The Flying Gauchito&quot;, illustrated by Walt Kelly, in issue No. 24 (August 1942).

To facilitate birthday and holiday gift giving to youngsters, Western Publishing offered to send subscription recipients illustrated letters that announced the gift. Various premiums were also offered for new subscribers, including a mini-poster attributed to &quot;Pogo&quot; creator Walt Kelly advertised on the back cover of issue No. 100 (Jan. 1949). Walt Kelly would do the cover art for many issues between No. 34 and No. 118 and provided interior art for issues # 34–41 and 43.

The anthology format usually began with a 10-page story featuring Donald Duck and for most of the run ended with a serial or single story featuring Mickey Mouse. The most popular issues featured the Donald Duck 10-pagers written and drawn by Carl Barks, who began the run with issue No. 31 (April 1943) and ended with original stories in issue No. 312 (September 1966), but have been continually reprinted. Almost all of these stories co-starred Donald&#x27;s nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, with frequent guest appearances by Barks&#x27; most famous creation, Scrooge McDuck, as well as the Beagle Boys, Gyro Gearloose, and Gladstone Gander.

Many 1940s issues featured Mickey Mouse serials by Floyd Gottfredson which were reprinted from newspaper daily comic strips; later, Paul Murry took over drawing original Mickey Mouse serials, with stories written by Carl Fallberg and Don Christensen among others. The 1980s saw numerous Murry reprints; the 1990s and more recent times saw new Mickey Mouse stories by Noel Van Horn and (usually only drawn by) Cesar Ferioli, as well as some Gottfredson serials not previously anthologized in comic book format.

Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf stories began in issue No. 52 (January 1945) and remained a regular feature for more than ten years, continuing to appear in the majority of issues even after the continuous run stopped. Carl Buettner (1945–1946), Gil Turner (1948–1956), and Dick Matena (2005–2008) are generally regarded as the most notable Wolf creators featured in the title. In the 2000s, Big Bad Wolf often supplanted his son as title character of the stories.

Bucky Bug stories began in issue No. 20 (May 1942) with a series of newspaper reprints; original Bucky stories started a while later, in issue No. 39 (December 1943). Bucky stories were monthly through 1950, were not seen for several decades, then returned on an occasional basis from 1988 onwards, with a mixture of old and new material.

By the mid-1950s, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; was the best selling comic book in the United States, with a monthly circulation of over three million. Mark Evanier described the high circulation as the product of &quot;an aggressive subscription push.&quot;

In many 1980s issues, as well as scattered issues from 2006 onward, new Donald Duck stories by Daan Jippes or Freddy Milton would lead off the title. Issues No. 523, 524, 526, 528, 531, and 547 (all 1987–1990) featured lead-off stories drawn (and usually written) by Don Rosa, while most issues published between 1993 and 2005 featured lead-offs by William Van Horn.

After reaching its 600th issue, the title converted to prestige format and remained that way until the end of Gemstone&#x27;s run at issue No. 698.

In September 2009, with the publishing rights of the &quot;core four&quot; comics being moved to Boom! Studios, the comic was cut down to 24 pages per issue and began focusing on printing multi-part story arcs that would run for about four issues each, the first being the infamous &quot;Ultraheroes&quot; arc (which would be concluded in its own series that ran for eight issues). As with all of Boom!&#x27;s Disney comics, each issue had at least two different variant covers, though this was eventually stopped at issue No. 709. At the start of 2011, to celebrate the comic&#x27;s 70th anniversary, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; returned to its original anthology format. However, due to &quot;The Incredibles&quot; comic book being cancelled on a cliffhanger the previous year, coupled with Disney having acquired Marvel Comics two years earlier, Disney opted not to renew their deal with Boom! Studios, forcing Boom! to abruptly end their run with the title at issue No. 720. It was later announced that their first issue of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; would be published on July 22, 2015. Similar to the Boom! issues, each of IDW&#x27;s issues were published with at least two different variant covers, with at least one cover being based on Disney theme parks and attractions in the first year.

Under IDW, issue No. 726 featured the first appearance of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in the series.

To make room for the inclusion of the localized &quot;Duck Avenger&quot; title in the line, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; switched to bimonthly publication in July 2016, alternating with &quot;Duck Avenger&quot; each month. Due to IDW&#x27;s Disney line expanding to include &quot;Tangled&quot; and &quot;DuckTales&quot; in July 2017, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; switched to quarterly publication from that point onward. It switched back to monthly publication when its name was shortened to &quot;Disney Comics and Stories&quot; in September 2018.

Unlike the other three &quot;core four&quot; comics, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; retained its original numbering system when IDW launched its Disney line; however, when the book&#x27;s title was shortened, IDW restarted the numbering system as if it were a new series, instead including the legacy numbering (#744–756) in the issues&#x27; indicia.

===Publishing history===
==Notable stories==

The following is a list of notable stories that had their first American printings in an issue of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;.

==Numbering==
While the issues are now referred to with sequential numbers, the format for the first ten years of the comic was to use the volume and number. Each volume contained 12 issues thus issue No. 13 (October 1941) was labeled &quot;Vol. 2 No. 1&quot; and included several stories about superstitions, especially about the number 13. The title started using whole numbers with issue No. 124, in January 1951.

===Publishers===
The publishers of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; have been:

The first issue of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; sold 252,000 copies. By issue No. 23 (August 1942), the comic was printing 1,000,000 copies per issue. They reached 2 million copies by issue No. 66 (March 1946) and 3 million by issue No. 131 (August 1951). The magazine hit its peak at 3,115,000 copies of issue No. 144 (September 1952).

==Collections==
Between 1984 and 1990, Another Rainbow Publishing collected all of Carl Barks&#x27;s Disney comics as &quot;The Carl Barks Library&quot;. Gladstone Publishing released further reprints of Barks&#x27;s stories in the 1990s.

In 2011, KaBOOM! published the first volume of an &quot;Archives&quot; series collecting issues from the beginning of the comic&#x27;s run. In 2018, IDW released an anthology of its stories.

<text>The Big Bad Wolf is a fictional wolf appearing in several cautionary tales, including some of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;. Versions of this character have appeared in numerous works, and it has become a generic archetype of a menacing predatory antagonist.

==Interpretations==
&quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids&quot;, &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; and the Russian tale &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, reflect the theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its belly, but the general theme of restoration is very old.

The dialogue between the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; from the &quot;Elder Edda&quot;; the giant Þrymr had stolen Mjölner, Thor&#x27;s hammer, and demanded Freyja as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor&#x27;s unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, Loki explains them as Freyja not having slept, or eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding.

19th-century Folklorists and cultural anthropologists such as P. Saintyves and Edward Burnett Tylor saw Little Red Riding Hood in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles, stating that the wolf represents the night swallowing the sun, and the variations in which Little Red Riding Hood is cut out of the wolf&#x27;s belly represent the dawn. In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and Skoll or Fenrir, the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow the sun at Ragnarök.

Ethologist Dr. Valerius Geist of the University of Calgary, Alberta wrote that the fable was likely based on genuine risk of wolf attacks at the time. He argues that wolves are in fact dangerous predators, and fables served as a valid warning not to enter forests where wolves were known to live, and to be on the look out for such. Both wolves and wilderness were treated as enemies of humanity in that region and time.

==Modern standard adaptations==
===Disney version===
The Big Bad Wolf, also known as Zeke Midas Wolf or Br&#x27;er Wolf, is a fictional character from Walt Disney&#x27;s cartoon short &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, directed by Burt Gillett and first released on May 27, 1933. The Wolf&#x27;s voice was provided by Billy Bletcher. As in the folktale, he was a cunning and threatening menace. The short also introduced the Wolf&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot;, written by Frank Churchill.

The Wolf is shown as wearing a top hat, red pants, green suspenders and white gloves. However, he does not wear a shirt or shoes. The Wolf has a taste for disguising himself, but both the audience and the Practical Pig can easily see through the Wolf&#x27;s disguises. With each successive short, the Wolf exhibits a fondness for dressing in drag and, even &quot;seduces&quot; Fiddler and Fifer Pigs, who become increasingly clueless as to his disguises with each installment, with such disguises as &quot;Goldilocks the Fairy Queen&quot;, Little Bo Peep and a mermaid.

In an interview with Melvyn Bragg in the early 1980s, the British actor Laurence Olivier said that Disney&#x27;s Big Bad Wolf was supposedly based on a widely detested American theatre director and producer called Jed Harris. When Olivier produced a film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, he based some of his mannerisms on Harris, and his physical appearance on the wolf.

The short was so popular that Walt Disney produced several sequels, which also featured the Wolf as the villain. The first of them was named after him: &quot;The Big Bad Wolf&quot;, also directed by Burt Gillett and first released on April 14, 1934. In the next of the sequels, &quot;Three Little Wolves&quot; (1936), he was accompanied by three just-as-carnivorous sons. (These three sons were later reduced to just one who, in contrast to his father, was full of goodness and charm and a friend of the Three Little Pigs.) The fourth cartoon featuring the Three Little Pigs and the Wolf, &quot;The Practical Pig&quot;, was released in 1939. During World War II, a final, propaganda cartoon followed, produced by The National Film Board of Canada: &quot;The Thrifty Pig&quot; (1941).

At the end of each short, the Wolf is dealt with by the resourceful thinking and hard work of Practical Pig. In the original short, he falls into a boiling pot prepared by the pigs. In &quot;The Big Bad Wolf&quot;, Practical pours popcorn and hot coals down his pants. In the final two shorts, Practical invents an anti-Wolf contraption to deal with the Wolf, who is shown to be powerless against the marvels of modern technology. The &quot;Wolf Pacifier&quot; in &quot;Three Little Wolves&quot; entraps him, chases him with a buzz-saw, hits his head with rolling pins, kicks him in the butt with boots, punches his face with boxing gloves, and finally tars and feathers him before firing him out of a cannon, all accomplished automatically and in time to a version of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot;. In &quot;The Practical Pig&quot;, the wolf falls into Practical Pig&#x27;s trap and is subjected to the Lie Detector, which washes his mouth out with soap, whacks his hands with rulers, or pulls down his pants and spanks him when he tells a lie. The machine&#x27;s punishment grows harsher and harsher the more he lies, until it is finally spinning him around, smacking his head and scrubbing his bottom. When he finally tells the truth, he is shot away by a rocket stuck up his shirt.

The Big Bad Wolf also made appearances in other Disney cartoons. In &quot;Toby Tortoise Returns&quot;, Practical and the Wolf made cameo appearances during the boxing match between Toby Tortoise and Max Hare. The Wolf also appeared in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Polo Team&quot;, as part of a game of Polo between four of Disney&#x27;s animated characters (one of whom was the Wolf) and four animated caricatures of noted film actors.

He also appeared in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, dressed as a streetcorner Santa Claus at the beginning of the featurette.

The Wolf made a couple of brief cameo appearances in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, first hiding behind a lamppost in Toontown, and later at the end of the film when all the toons are gathered, wearing a sheep costume and mask which he instantly stripped off to reveal his true wolfish features. He was voiced by Tony Pope in this one (who was perhaps well known for providing the voice of the original Furby).

====Comic books ====
In 1936, Disney&#x27;s Big Bad Wolf came to Sunday newspaper comics, which were reformatted and reprinted in the monthly &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; in 1941. They were popular enough there that a demand for new Big Bad Wolf comics arose. From 1945, the original WDC&amp;S series &quot;Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf&quot; nominally starred Big Bad Wolf&#x27;s good little cub, but &quot;Pop&quot; repeatedly stole the spotlight. Carl Buettner, Gil Turner and Jack Bradbury were among the noted creators to work on the series in its early years, with Buettner giving Big Bad Wolf his proper name of Zeke (1946) and Turner supplying his middle name of Midas (1949).

In the comics, Big Bad Wolf generally wants his son to become a bad guy like himself; but, unlike the three little wolves who appeared in the shorts, the gentle Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf does not live up to his father&#x27;s expectations. Indeed, Li&#x27;l Bad is friends with the Pigs, Thumper, and other forest characters whom the comics portray as Zeke&#x27;s intended prey. A running gag in the comics typically comes when in trying to catch the Pigs, Zeke runs afoul of Br&#x27;er Bear, who ends up pounding &quot;Br&#x27;er Wolf&quot; for one offense or another. Another gag is that Br&#x27;er/Zeke Wolf never succeeds at anything such as camping or stealing farm products; once he actually caught a duck for dinner but it ended up tasting awful and later he ended up with a whole pack of ducks-which turn out to be mud hens! Another time even when he twice caught chickens {once by accident} he still loses as usual! In Disney&#x27;s comics his appearance is a little different than original: he usually wears an all-blue clothing but white gloves; and his son follows the same pattern of his father clothes, but he uses red instead of blue.

=====Disney&#x27;s Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf=====
Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf (or just Li&#x27;l Wolf as referred to by his friends) is Zeke &quot;Big Bad&quot; Wolf&#x27;s son. In spite of his name, Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf wants to be a good little wolf; badness is really the domain of his father. Zeke wants his son to be just as bad as he is, but the kindhearted (or, at worst, naive) Li&#x27;l Wolf, despite wanting to please his father, cannot bring himself to do others harm. Even worse for Zeke, Li&#x27;l Wolf&#x27;s best friends are the Three Little Pigs themselves, and he constantly saves them from his father&#x27;s appetite. Despite disappointing his father, Zeke Wolf was shown to be very fond of his son, and Li&#x27;l Wolf of his father.

Li&#x27;l Wolf debuted in his own self-titled series, beginning in the comic book &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #52 (1945). The first story was written by Dorothy Strebe and illustrated by Carl Buettner. The feature ran regularly through 1957, when it temporarily moved to the back pages of &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;. Li&#x27;l Wolf returned to &quot;Comics and Stories&quot; in 1961, after which he continued to appear there frequently through 2008. Li&#x27;l Wolf has in fact starred in more issues of &quot;Comics and Stories&quot; than any other character except for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.

Apart from &quot;Comics and Stories&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, Li&#x27;l Wolf has also appeared in many different Disney anthology comic books, including a number of giant-size specials and a series of one-page text stories in &quot;Donald Duck&quot;.

Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf&#x27;s only comic strip appearance was in the &quot;Disney Christmas Story&quot; for 1963, &quot;Three Little Pigs Christmas Story&quot;. This sequence was drawn by Floyd Gottfredson, who reinstated Li&#x27;l Wolf&#x27;s sharp teeth.

From 2003 to 2008, reflecting a trend initiated in European Disney comics, Zeke Wolf increasingly often featured as the title character in new stories himself, although Li&#x27;l Wolf continued to play a minor role.

Li&#x27;l Wolf&#x27;s first animated appearance was in the &quot;Raw Toonage&quot; short &quot;The Porker&#x27;s Court&quot;. However, he later appeared, in a more traditional role, in a self-titled short on &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. The voice for the animated Li&#x27;l Wolf in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; was provided by Sam Gifaldi. Li&#x27;l Wolf is not to be confused with the Three Little Wolves, Big Bad Wolf&#x27;s three mischievous sons who appeared in the cartoon shorts &quot;The Three Little Wolves&quot; and &quot;The Practical Pig&quot;, although he closely resembles them.

====TV series appearances====
Along with other Disney characters, the Big Bad Wolf appears in the animated opening of the television series &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;.

In the series &quot;Bonkers&quot;, the Big Bad Wolf appears in the episode &quot;The 29th Page&quot; at a prison line-up along with other Disney criminals, and in &quot;CasaBonkers&quot; where Katya tosses him out of his car so she can go after Bonkers.

The Big Bad Wolf has been a recurring character in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, where he is voiced by Jim Cummings. His first appearance on this show featured him as a jazz artist called &quot;Big Bad Wolf Daddy&quot; (a parody of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy), performing a swing version of his song with the Pigs as his backup band (they are under a contract that states he will eat them if they do not play for him). In this episode, his tendency to destroy houses by exhaling is shown to be an allergy-like reaction to the sight of a door. Later appearances on &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, however, returned the Wolf to his more traditional role; one episode even featured a newly made short starring the character, based on the aforementioned Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf comic stories. Apart from the series appearances, Big Bad Wolf was one of the villains in the direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot;.

In the TV short series &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, the Big Bad Wolf appears in the episode &quot;Sock Burglar&quot;, as one of the villains suspected of stealing the town&#x27;s socks, and in &quot;The Perfect Dream&quot; as a rogue biker. In the spinoff series &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;, he is a central character in the episode &quot;The Big Good Wolf&quot; (voiced by Clancy Brown), where Mickey tries to reform him, but while characters are found that can help him be good, he ends up devouring them one by one, until Mickey manages to rescue them from his stomach.

====Other appearances====
As a walkaround costumed character, Big Bad Wolf appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts for meet-and-greets, parades and shows.

In the video game &quot;Magical Tetris Challenge&quot;, Big Bad Wolf is one of Pete&#x27;s henchmen, along with a Weasel and is the boss the player fights before Pete, the final boss. His levels theme seems to be a disco remix, with him wearing a purple top hat with a matching tailcoat, white dress shirt, red bow tie, purple trousers and brown Oxfords.

The Big Bad Wolf also appeared in &quot;The Kingdom Keepers&quot; series, in the fourth book, &quot;Power Play&quot;, where he appeared non anthropomorphized. In the book, he attempted to eat Pluto and the main characters, Finn and Amanda. He ends up falling into the Rivers of America.

The Big Bad Wolf makes a cameo on an Old West Wanted poster in &quot;Disney Magical World 2&quot;.

The character has also appeared as a playable character in video games such as &quot;Disney Sorcerer&#x27;s Arena&quot; and &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;.

===MGM/Tex Avery&#x27;s Big Bad Wolf===

Created by animation director Tex Avery, this variation of the Big Bad Wolf&#x27;s cartoons included many sexual overtones, violence, and very rapid gags, and never became as successful as the Disney incarnation.

He debuted in &quot;Blitz Wolf&quot; (1942)—as Adolf Wolf, the Three Pigs&#x27; Hitler-like foe—similar to the classic Disney Big Bad Wolf; Adolf Wolf, who is set on invading the pig&#x27;s nation of Pigmania. The pig who built his house of stone, &quot;Sergeant Pork&quot; (an homage to Sergeant York), take his precautions and outfits his house with defense machinery, but the two pigs who built their houses of straw and sticks claim they do not have to take precautions against the wolf because they signed a non-aggression pact with him. Adolf Wolf invades Pigmania, despite the two pigs protesting that he signed a treaty with them. He destroys their houses, the straw house with &quot;Der Mechanized Huffer Und Puffer&quot; and the stick house with an artillery shell, forcing the pigs to take shelter in the third pig&#x27;s house, prompting a battle between the two parties. Towards the end of the cartoon, Adolf Wolf is blown out of his bomber plane by the pigs&#x27; artillery shells, fired from their multi-barreled &quot;secret weapon&quot; and filled with Defense bonds, and plummets down to Earth followed by a bomb from his own plane, which promptly blows him to Hell upon impact.

The Avery Wolf returned as a Hollywood swinger in &quot;Red Hot Riding Hood&quot; (1943), memorably aroused by Red&#x27;s song and dance performance. Further girl-chasing roles came to the Wolf in &quot;Wild and Wolfy&quot;, &quot;Swing Shift Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Little Rural Riding Hood&quot;; simultaneously, the Wolf was used as foe against Avery&#x27;s Droopy, a role he would keep into the 1950s. He would later reprise the role in the &quot;Droopy and Dripple&quot; segments of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; (1990).

The Avery Wolf was voiced by Bill Thompson (&quot;Blitz Wolf&quot;), Frank Graham (&quot;Dumb-Hounded, Red Hot Riding Hood, The Shooting of Dan McGoo, Swing Shift Cinderella, Northwest Hounded Police&quot;), Kent Rogers (&quot;Red Hot Riding Hood&quot; and &quot;One Ham&#x27;s Family&quot;), Billy Bletcher (&quot;The Screwy Truant&quot;), Patrick McGeehan (&quot;The Screwy Truant&quot; and &quot;Wild and Woolfy&quot;), Tex Avery (&quot;Wild and Woolfy&quot;), Daws Butler (&quot;Little Rural Riding Hood&quot;), Manuel Paris (&quot;Caballero Droopy&quot;), Frank Welker (&quot;The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show&quot;, &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot;, &quot;Droopy Master Detective&quot;), Lou Scheimer (&quot;The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show&quot;), Will Ryan (&quot;Thanks a Latte&quot;), Dave Redl (&quot;Web Premiere Toons&quot;), John DiMaggio (&quot;Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse&quot;) and Stephen Stanton (&quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot;).

The Avery Wolf&#x27;s actual name has varied over time. It was seldom given in the 1940s, but a 1945 studio announcement called him Wally Wolf. In modern-day appearances, the Wolf&#x27;s name is often given as Slick Wolf or McWolf.

The Avery Wolf was referenced in the film &quot;The Mask&quot; (1994), when Stanley/The Mask (performed by Jim Carrey) briefly transforms into him while watching Tina Carlyle perform in a Red Hot Riding Hood-like performance, howling and whistling at her and then banging his head with a mallet. The Mask also changes into his wolf-like form on occasion in the spin-off animated series of the same name, particularly in the animated crossover featuring &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;.

A similar wolf appeared in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;Bacall to Arms&quot;, as a theater patron whose lustful mannerisms echoed that of Avery&#x27;s character. The director had left Warner Brothers&#x27; employ five years before after a dispute, so it is not certain if this was supposed to be an homage, or if Avery originally had plans to use the wolf on a project that were not realized at the time of his suspension.

====Featured shorts====
===&quot;Nu Pogodi!&quot;===
In the Soviet animated series &quot;Nu Pogodi&quot;, the wolf, commonly translated into English as &quot;Volk&quot; (), is portrayed as a hooligan who eagerly turns to vandalism, abuses minors, breaks laws and is a heavy smoker. His adventures revolve around constant failures to capture a Hare. On the other hand, many of Wolf&#x27;s attempts to catch Hare are often characterized by uncanny abilities on his part (including figure skating, ballet and waltzing) which demonstrate his more refined side. Wolf can also play the guitar very well and ride the powerful rocker motorbike, making his character more sophisticated than a normal hooligan.

In the first episode, while climbing a high building to catch Hare, Wolf whistles the popular mountaineer song, &quot;Song of a Friend&quot; (the signature song of Vladimir Vysotsky). In spite of these talents, most of Wolf&#x27;s schemes eventually fail or turn against him. The character was originally voiced by Anatoli Papanov.

===&quot;Revolting Rhymes&quot;===
In the book &quot;Revolting Rhymes&quot;, by famous writer Roald dahl, the Big Bad Wolves from &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; and &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; appear. In the book&#x27;s version of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, the Big Bad Wolf devours grandma like the story and an unfooled Little Red Riding Hood uses her concealed pistol to shoot him dead. She managed to make a wolfskin coat from him. In the book&#x27;s version of &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, the Big Bad Wolf devoured the two pigs after blowing down the house. The third pig enlists Little Red Riding Hood to deal with this wolf and she does so in the same way as she did the other wolf.

In the film adaption, a Wolf (voiced by Dominic West) serves as a storyteller to Little Red Riding Hood&#x27;s children after incapacitating their intended babysitter Mrs. Hunt. He has two nephews named Rolf (voiced by Rob Brydon) and Rex (voiced by David Walliams). Rolf was the one who ate Little Red Riding Hood&#x27;s grandmother following a falling out with his uncle and is killed by Little Red Riding Hood who later skinned him for a wolf-skin coat. Rex eats the Banker Pig&#x27;s brothers and is killed by Little Red Riding Hood when he tries to use dynamite on his bank. Once Little Red Riding Hood&#x27;s children are asleep after the story, the Wolf decides not to exact revenge for his dead nephews and leaves the house wishing Little Red Riding Hood a good night. After exiting the bus, the Wolf sheds Mrs. Hunt&#x27;s clothes and runs into the woods.

===&quot;Into the Woods&quot;===
The Big Bad Wolf is a minor character in the 1987 Broadway musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot; by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. The Big Bad Wolf was portrayed by Robert Westenberg in the original Broadway cast and Chuck Wagner in the first national tour. The 2002 Broadway revival featured the Wolves from &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; and &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;. They were portrayed by Gregg Edelman and Christopher Sieber, respectively. Gavin Creel portrayed the role in the original cast of the 2022 Broadway revival, Cheyenne Jackson and Andy Karl both replaced Creel in the role for limited runs.

The musical was adapted into a film by Walt Disney Pictures and directed by Rob Marshall, where Johnny Depp played the role of the Big Bad Wolf.

===&quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After&quot;===
The film &quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After&quot; featured three Big Bad Wolves. The Fat Wolf (voiced by Jon Polito) is the alpha of the Big Bad Wolves and based on the Big Bad Wolf from &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats&quot;. The Tough Wolf (voiced by Tom Kenny) is the second-in-command, is based on the Big Bad Wolf from &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, and is often competing with the Fat Wolf. The Crazy Wolf, based on the Big Bad Wolf from &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, does not speak and is the runt of the litter.

===&quot;Dimension 20 Neverafter&quot;===
In the actual play show Dimension 20&#x27;s 15th season, the Big Bad Wolf is the manifestation of Death in the world of the Neverafter, who, after meeting with a starving Little Red Riding Hood, allows her to kill him, and eat his flesh, turning her into a werewolf. When the wolf passes, Little Red is left to &quot;take up the mantle of Death&quot;, turning into a full wolf.

==Modern positive adaptations==
Several recent interpretations of the Big Bad Wolf show him as being a character with relatively good intentions, mostly considered &quot;Bad&quot; due to a misunderstanding or prejudice. Arguably, this practice started with the 1989 children&#x27;s book &quot;The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!&quot; However, the best-known &quot;good&quot; adaptations are from films, where it is mostly used for a comedic effect.

===&quot;The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!&quot;===

The story as told by Alexander T. Wolf from The Three Little Pigs suggests that wolves may not necessarily have to be &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;, but are perhaps misunderstood because what they eat happens to be cute. It should be inferred, however, that the following story given by Alexander T. Wolf is merely a fiction made up to conceal his guilt. Alexander T. Wolf, portrayed as rather civil, had a cold. He was baking a cake for his grandmother&#x27;s birthday and the wolf had to travel to the little pigs&#x27; houses to borrow a cup of sugar. Each time the pigs turned him away, Alexander T. Wolf&#x27;s cold caused him to huff and puff and sneeze a great sneeze whereupon the wolf would accidentally destroy the pig&#x27;s house. Finding the inhabitant deceased, the Alexander T. Wolf decided to eat the body so as not to let good meat go to waste, since the pig was dead anyway. The final pig&#x27;s house was not blown down and Alexander T. Wolf went into an excessive sneezing fit while the pig allegedly insulted his grandmother. The authorities came and dragged a furious and flustered wolf away and locked him up in prison. It is from prison where Alexander T. Wolf is now telling his (not entirely convincing) story as the news reports have found out about the two dead pigs he ate and jazzed up their story. Now labeled the &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot;, Alexander T. Wolf stated that he was framed. The story ended with a white-bearded Alexander T. Wolf quoting &quot;But maybe you can loan me a cup of sugar&quot;.

===&quot;Looney Tunes&quot;&#x27; Big Bad Wolf===
The &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series used the Big Bad Wolf as a stock character in several of its shorts, widely varying in its portrayal depending on the short&#x27;s storyline. In the 1957 short &quot;Three Little Bops&quot;, the wolf (voiced by Stan Freberg) plays a trumpet rather badly while instrument playing pigs engage in club hopping using clubs made of straw, sticks, and bricks. There is also a version appearing mostly in Bugs Bunny cartoons such as &quot;Little Red Riding Rabbit&quot;, &quot;The Windblown Hare&quot; (in which he is voiced by Billy Bletcher and Jim Backus, respectively), and many more. This was a more humorous wolf, being somewhat stupid and prone to anger. In &quot;Pigs in a Polka&quot;, the wolf is portrayed as a master of disguise, dressing as a gypsy and a beggar to fool the Three Little Pigs. A typical gag in these stories would have a sign poke into the foreground, stating, &quot;IT&#x27;S THE BIG, BAD WOLF&quot;, whereupon the wolf would angrily shove it away, saying, &quot;Oh, all right, knock it off! They know who I am!&quot; A different version of the Big Bad Wolf was a friend of Sylvester and antagonist of Tweety in the short &quot;Red Riding Hoodwinked&quot;.

===Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Loopy de Loop&quot;===

The only theatrical short subject cartoon series produced by Hanna-Barbera after they left MGM and formed their own studio, &quot;Loopy de Loop&quot; is cast as a tuque-topped, kind-hearted wolf who speaks with a bad French Canadian accent, and whose kind-hearted attempts to assist almost always ended up by being rejected by those he sought to help-or something slightly worse.

===&quot;Hoodwinked!&quot;===
The Weinstein Company&#x27;s animated films &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot; and &quot;Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil&quot; features the Wolf as a misunderstood Fletch-type investigator voiced by Patrick Warburton. The Wolf, whose full name is Wolf W. Wolf, works undercover assignments. His assistant and cameraman is a hyperactive squirrel named Twitchy and he writes a column for &quot;The Once Upon a Times&quot;. His reason for stalking Red Puckett is not to eat her, but rather to get information from her about a mysterious thief striking this part of the woods.

===&quot;Shrek&quot;===

The animated &quot;Shrek&quot; film series reversed many conventional roles found in fairy tales, including depicting the Big Bad Wolf (voiced by Aron Warner) from &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; as a friendly, misunderstood cross-dresser (apparently still wearing the girl&#x27;s Grandmother&#x27;s clothes) and on good terms with the Three Little Pigs. This depiction, and Pinocchio&#x27;s expansive nose, in &quot;Shrek 2&quot; raised the ire of some groups who objected to the film&#x27;s sexual content, in what is billed as a children&#x27;s film.

In &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot;, a variation of the Big Bad Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura) appears as the personification of death, who wishes to kill Puss in Boots and remove his last life, as he believes he has wasted the others.

In the fighting game &quot;Shrek SuperSlam&quot;, released in 2005, Big Bad Wolf is a playable character and appears as &quot;Huff n Puff Wolf&quot;.

===&quot;Sesame Street&quot;===
The Big Bad Wolf has become a regularly recurring puppet character on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, appearing usually in purple fur (although he originally had blue shaggy fur, as he was a variant of Herry Monster). Besides the purple and blue variants, there were also green and white versions of the Big Bad Wolf. He is generally performed by Jerry Nelson (particularly the blue version) and occasionally performed by Tyler Bunch, Kevin Clash, Joey Mazzarino, Martin P. Robinson, David Rudman, and Matt Vogel.

In episode 3001, the music number &quot;Bad Wolf&quot; showed the Big Bad Wolf (performed by David Rudman) with his family which consists of his mother Big Glad Wolf (performed by Louise Gold), his father Well-Clad Wolf (performed by Jerry Nelson), his brother Big Rad Wolf (performed by Joey Mazzarino), his sister Big Sad Wolf (performed by Camille Bonora), his aunt Big Grad Wolf (performed by Fran Brill), and his uncle Big Mad Wolf (performed by Martin P. Robinson).

In episode 4035, the Big Bad Wolf is shown to have a brother named Leonard Wolf (performed by Jerry Nelson), who tells Elmo and Rosita that not all wolves are the same.

In episode 4219, the Big Bad Wolf works in the hair-drying salon after telling Elmo and Telly Monster that he is no longer in the pig-chasing business.

In episode 4266, the Big Bad Wolf huffs and puffs Slimey the Worm when he is unable to catch the Three Little Pigs not realizing the harm he is doing to Slimey. When he does realize this thanks to Alan, Big Bird. Mr. Snuffleupagus, and Oscar the Grouch, the Big Bad Wolf apologizes to Slimey and starts a hobby of bubble blowing.

The puppet for the purple variant of the Big Bad Wolf appeared in &quot;The Furchester Hotel&quot; as different characters.

===&quot;Fables&quot;===
The comic book series &quot;Fables&quot; by Bill Willingham features a reformed Big Bad Wolf as a major character, commonly referred to as &quot;Bigby&quot;. In order to pass for human, (the other animal fables want nothing to do with him), he has been infected with lycanthropy, making him, in essence, a werewolf. He acts as sheriff for the Fable community, going by the name of Bigby Wolf. He is often portrayed as a typical film-noir-style trenchcoat-wearing detective. In the context of the series, he earned the name &quot;Big Bad&quot; after his (much larger) siblings sarcastically noted his drive to be ferocious, particularly after his father, the incarnation of the North Wind, left his mother due to a wind&#x27;s nature of having to move, else the wind would never reach other lands. Due to his unique parentage, his infamous &quot;huff &#x27;n puff&quot; is a form of wind control that has been shown to be powerful enough to smash trees down, blow out an army of flaming animated puppetmen, and Bigby once conjectured that even a brick house would most likely be blown to bits by it. Bigby Wolf serves as the main protagonist and player character of the 2013 video game adaptation of &quot;Fables&quot;, &quot;The Wolf Among Us&quot;. He is shown to have four forms—fully human, still mostly human but with wolf eyes, fangs, claws, and higher strength, a humanoid wolf of still greater strength, and a towering four-legged wolf possessing immense power and speed.

===&quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot;===
In the 2000 eight-hour film (broadcast as a mini-series) &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot;, Scott Cohen plays a character called Wolf, which is based on the Big Bad Wolf and there is some speculation to whether he may even be the Big Bad Wolf&#x27;s descendant (mainly owed to the fact that most other characters in the mini-series are descendants of many well-known fairy tale characters). Wolf recognizes he has a sort of obsessive-compulsive disorder towards eating lamb meat, rabbit meat, or little-girl meat, which he tries to overcome when he falls in love with Virginia, the main character. (Note that her married name would be Virginia Wolf.)

===&quot;BB Wolf and the Three LPs&quot;===
A 2010 hardcover graphic novel published by Top Shelf Comics by J.D. Arnold and Rich Koslowski, sets the wolf as a sympathetic victim of class warfare in the rural south. Pigs and wolves serve as allegorical races in the story, with the wolves as disenfranchised farmers and the pigs as wealthy elitists. When the blues-playing wolf suffers numerous crimes at the hands of pigs, he swears revenge and rampages through the southern underworld. The hardcover is available with a CD of its songs as sung by BB Wolf.

===&quot;Dust City&quot;===
&quot;Dust City&quot;, a 2010 novel by Robert Paul Weston, circles around Henry Whelp, the son of the Big Bad Wolf. In it, Henry&#x27;s father was framed by a league of those who transport fairy dust. Henry must discover the truth and help to release his father.

===&quot;Holka Polka: A Fairytail Mystery&quot;===
&quot;Holka Polka&quot;, a children&#x27;s play features the character in a different light, as someone who is afraid of little girls and cannot scare them and is not menacing at all.

===&quot;Goldie &amp; Bear&quot;===
The Big Bad Wolf appears in the Disney Junior preschool series &quot;Goldie &amp; Bear&quot; voiced by Jim Cummings (who also voiced other Disney version of the character). In the show he is called Big Bad Wolf or Big Bad (his real name is Aloysius). He is a troublemaker that likes scaring people, stealing, and being rude. However, he is also depicted as having a conscience and at times being a nice guy.

<text>The Java Native Interface (JNI) is a foreign function interface programming framework that enables Java code running in a Java virtual machine (JVM) to call and be called by native applications (programs specific to a hardware and operating system platform) and libraries written in other languages such as C, C++ and assembly.

== Objectives ==
JNI enables programmers to write native methods to handle situations when an application cannot be written entirely in the Java programming language, e.g. when the standard Java class library does not support the platform-specific features or program library. It is also used to modify an existing application (written in another programming language) to be accessible to Java applications. Many of the standard library classes depend on JNI to provide functionality to the developer and the user, e.g. file I/O and sound capabilities. Including performance- and platform-sensitive API implementations in the standard library allows all Java applications to access this functionality in a safe and platform-independent manner.

The JNI framework lets a native method use Java objects in the same way that Java code uses these objects. A native method can create Java objects and then inspect and use these objects to perform its tasks. A native method can also inspect and use objects created by Java application code.

Only applications and signed applets can invoke JNI.

An application that relies on JNI loses the platform portability Java offers (a partial workaround is to write a separate implementation of JNI code for each platform and have Java detect the operating system and load the correct one at runtime).

Not only can native code interface with Java, it can also draw on a Java , which is possible with the Java AWT Native Interface. The process is almost the same, with just a few changes. The Java AWT Native Interface is only available since J2SE 1.3.

JNI also allows direct access to assembly code, without even going through a C bridge. Accessing Java applications from assembly is possible in the same way.

== Design ==
In the JNI framework, native functions are implemented in separate .c or .cpp files. (C++ provides a slightly simpler interface with JNI.) When the JVM invokes the function, it passes a codice_1 pointer, a codice_2 pointer, and any Java arguments declared by the Java method. For example, the following converts a Java string to a native string:
extern &quot;C&quot;
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_ClassName_MethodName
 (JNIEnv *env, jobject obj, jstring javaString)
 const char *nativeString = env-&gt;GetStringUTFChars(javaString, 0);

 //Do something with the nativeString

 env-&gt;ReleaseStringUTFChars(javaString, nativeString);


The &quot;codice_3&quot; pointer is a structure that contains the interface to the JVM. It includes all of the functions necessary to interact with the JVM and to work with Java objects. Example JNI functions are converting native arrays to/from Java arrays, converting native strings to/from Java strings, instantiating objects, throwing exceptions, etc. Basically, anything that Java code can do can be done using codice_1, albeit with considerably less ease.

The argument &quot;codice_5&quot; is a reference to the Java object inside which this native method has been declared.

Native data types can be mapped to/from Java data types. For compound types such as objects, arrays and strings the native code must explicitly convert the data by calling methods in the codice_1.

A JNI environment pointer () is passed as an argument for each native function mapped to a Java method, allowing for interaction with the JNI environment within the native method. This JNI interface pointer can be stored, but remains valid only in the current thread. Other threads must first call to attach themselves to the VM and obtain a JNI interface pointer. Once attached, a native thread works like a regular Java thread running within a native method. The native thread remains attached to the VM until it calls to detach itself.

The JNI framework does not provide any automatic garbage collection for non-JVM memory resources allocated by code executing on the native side. Consequently, native side code (such as assembly language) assumes the responsibility for explicitly releasing any such memory resources that the native code acquires.

On Linux and Solaris platforms, if the native code registers itself as a signal handler, it could intercept signals intended for the JVM. A chain of responsibility can be used to allow native code to better inter-operate with the JVM. On Windows platforms, Structured Exception Handling (SEH) may be employed to wrap native code in SEH try/catch blocks so as to capture machine (CPU/FPU) generated software interrupts (such as NULL pointer access violations and divide-by-zero operations), and to handle these situations before the interrupt is propagated back up into the JVM (i.e. Java side code), in all likelihood resulting in an unhandled exception.

The encoding used for the NewStringUTF, GetStringUTFLength, GetStringUTFChars, ReleaseStringUTFChars and GetStringUTFRegion functions is &quot;modified UTF-8&quot;, which is not valid UTF-8 for all inputs, but a different encoding really. The null character (U+0000) and codepoints not on the Basic Multilingual Plane (greater than or equal to U+10000, i.e. those represented as &quot;surrogate pairs&quot; in UTF-16) are encoded differently in modified UTF-8. Many programs actually use these functions incorrectly and treat the UTF-8 strings returned or passed into the functions as standard UTF-8 strings instead of modified UTF-8 strings. Programs should use the NewString, GetStringLength, GetStringChars, ReleaseStringChars, GetStringRegion, GetStringCritical and ReleaseStringCritical functions, which use UTF-16LE encoding on little-endian architectures and UTF-16BE on big-endian architectures, and then use a UTF-16 to UTF-8 conversion routine.

== Mapping types ==
The following table shows the mapping of types between Java (JNI) and native code.

In addition, the signature codice_7 would mean the class uniquely specified by that name; e.g., the signature codice_8 refers to the class codice_9. Also, prefixing codice_10 to the signature makes the array of that type; for example, codice_11 means the int array type. Finally, a codice_12 signature uses the codice_13 code.

These types are interchangeable. One can use codice_14 where you normally use an codice_15, and vice versa, without any typecasting required. However, mapping between Java Strings and arrays to native strings and arrays is different. If a codice_16 is used where a codice_17 would be, the code could crash the JVM.

== Performance ==
JNI incurs considerable overhead and performance loss under certain circumstances:
* Function calls to JNI methods are expensive, especially when calling a method repeatedly.
* Native methods are not inlined by the JVM, nor can the method be JIT compiled, as the method is already compiled.
* A Java array may be copied for access in native code, and later copied back. The cost can be linear in the size of the array.
* If the method is passed an object, or needs to make a callback, then the native method will likely be making its own calls to the JVM. Accessing Java fields, methods and types from the native code requires something similar to reflective programming (reflection). Signatures are specified in strings and queried from the JVM. This is both slow and error-prone.
* Java Strings are objects, have length and are encoded. Accessing or creating a string may require an O(n) copy.

== Alternatives ==
Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary implementation of a Java Virtual Machine (Visual J++) had a similar mechanism for calling native code from Java, called the &quot;Raw Native Interface&quot; (&quot;RNI&quot;). In addition, it had an easy way to call existing native code that was not itself aware of Java, such as (but not limited to) the Windows API, called &quot;J/Direct&quot;. However, following the Sun–Microsoft litigation about this implementation, Visual J++ is no longer maintained.

RNI was less clumsy to use than JNI, because no bookkeeping with a Java environment pointer was needed. Instead, all Java objects could be accessed directly. To facilitate this, a tool was used that generated header files from Java classes. Similarly, J/Direct was easier to use than using the necessary intermediate native library and JNI.

Java Native Access (JNA) is a community-developed library that provides Java programers easy access to native shared libraries without using JNI. However, this requires the redistribution of the dependent jar library. The tradeoff is between JNI being harder to code and JNA being slower. JNI is built in to core Java.

Since Java 21, the newer Foreign Function and Memory API is encouraged for use over JNI, due to the reduced boilerplate and simplified interface.

<text>The Haskalah (; literally, &quot;wisdom&quot;, &quot;erudition&quot; or &quot;education&quot;), often termed the Jewish Enlightenment, was an intellectual movement among the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe, with a certain influence on those in Western Europe and the Muslim world. It arose as a defined ideological worldview during the 1770s, and its last stage ended around 1881, with the rise of Jewish nationalism.

The movement advocated against Jewish reclusiveness, encouraged the adoption of prevalent attire over traditional dress, while also working to diminish the authority of traditional community institutions such as rabbinic courts and boards of elders. It pursued a set of projects of cultural and moral renewal, including a revival of Hebrew for use in secular life, which resulted in an increase in Hebrew found in print. Concurrently, it strove for an optimal integration in surrounding societies. Practitioners promoted the study of exogenous culture, style, and vernacular, and the adoption of modern values. At the same time, economic production, and the taking up of new occupations was pursued. The &quot;Haskalah&quot; promoted rationalism, liberalism, relativism, and enquiry, and is largely perceived as the Jewish variant of the general Age of Enlightenment. The movement encompassed a wide spectrum ranging from moderates, who hoped for maximal compromise, to radicals, who sought sweeping changes.

In its various changes, the &quot;Haskalah&quot; fulfilled an important, though limited, part in the modernization of Central and Eastern European Jews. Its activists, the Maskilim, exhorted and implemented communal, educational and cultural reforms in both the public and the private spheres. Owing to its dual policies, it collided both with the traditionalist rabbinic elite, which attempted to preserve old Jewish values and norms in their entirety, and with the radical assimilationists who wished to eliminate or minimize the existence of the Jews as a defined collective.

===Literary circle===
The Haskalah was multifaceted, with many loci which rose and dwindled at different times and across vast territories. The name &quot;Haskalah&quot; became a standard self-appellation in 1860, when it was taken as the motto of the Odessa-based newspaper &quot;Ha-Melitz&quot;, but derivatives and the title &quot;Maskil&quot; for activists were already common in the first edition of &quot;Ha-Meassef&quot; from 1 October 1783: its publishers described themselves as &quot;Maskilim&quot;. While Maskilic centres sometimes had loose institutions around which their members operated, the movement as a whole lacked any such.

In spite of that diversity, the &quot;Maskilim&quot; shared a sense of common identity and self-consciousness. They were anchored in the existence of a shared literary canon, which began to be formulated in the first Maskilic locus at Berlin. Its members, like Moses Mendelssohn, Naphtali Hirz Wessely, Isaac Satanow and Isaac Euchel, authored tracts in various genres that were further disseminated and re-read among other Maskilim. Each generation, in turn, elaborated and added its own works to the growing body. The emergence of the Maskilic canon reflected the movement&#x27;s central and defining enterprise, the revival of Hebrew as a literary language for secular purposes (its restoration as a spoken tongue occurred only much later). The Maskilim researched and standardized grammar, minted countless neologisms and composed poetry, magazines, theatrical works and literature of all sorts in Hebrew. Historians described the movement largely as a Republic of Letters, an intellectual community based on printing houses and reading societies.

The Maskilim&#x27;s attitude toward Hebrew, as noted by Moses Pelli, was derived from Enlightenment perceptions of language as reflecting both individual and collective character. To them, a corrupt tongue mirrored the inadequate condition of the Jews which they sought to ameliorate. They turned to Hebrew as their primary creative medium. The Maskilim inherited the Medieval Grammarians&#x27; – such as Jonah ibn Janah and Judah ben David Hayyuj – distaste of Mishnaic Hebrew and preference of the Biblical one as pristine and correct. They turned to the Bible as a source and standard, emphatically advocating what they termed &quot;Pure Hebrew Tongue&quot; (&quot;S&#x27;fat E&#x27;ver tzacha&quot;) and lambasting the Rabbinic style of letters, which mixed it with Aramaic as a single &quot;Holy Tongue&quot; and often employed loanwords from other languages. Some activists, however, were not averse to using Mishnaic and Rabbinic forms. They also preferred the Sephardi pronunciation, considered more prestigious, to the Ashkenazi one, which was linked with the Jews of Poland, who were deemed backward. The movement&#x27;s literary canon is defined by a grandiloquent, archaic register copying the Biblical one and often combining lengthy allusions or direct quotes from verses in the prose.

During a century of activity, the Maskilim produced a massive contribution, forming the first phase of modern Hebrew literature. In 1755, Moses Mendelssohn began publishing &quot;Qohelet Musar&quot; &quot;The Moralist&quot;, regarded as the beginning of modern writing in Hebrew and the first journal in the language. Between 1789 and his death, Naphtali Hirz Wessely compiled &quot;Shirei Tif&#x27;eret&quot; &quot;Poems of Glory&quot;, an eighteen-part epic cycle concerning Moses that exerted influence on all neo-Hebraic poets in the following generations. was the Haskalah&#x27;s pioneering playwright, best known for his 1794 epic drama &quot;Melukhat Sha&#x27;ul&quot; &quot;Reign of Saul&quot;, which was printed in twelve editions by 1888. Judah Leib Ben-Ze&#x27;ev was the first modern Hebrew grammarian, and beginning with his 1796 manual of the language, he authored books which explored it and were vital reading material for young Maskilim until the end of the 19th century. Solomon Löwisohn was the first to translate Shakespeare into Hebrew, and an abridged form of the &quot;Are at this hour asleep!&quot; monologue in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; was included in his 1816 lyrical compilation &quot;Melitzat Yeshurun&quot; (Eloquence of Jeshurun).

Joseph Perl pioneered satirist writings in his biting, mocking critique of Hasidic Judaism, &quot;Megaleh Tmirin&quot; &quot;Revealer of Secrets&quot; from 1819. Avraham Dov Ber Lebensohn was primarily a leading metricist, with his 1842 &quot;Shirei S&#x27;fat haQodesh&quot; &quot;Verses in the Holy Tongue&quot; considered a milestone in Hebrew poetry, and also authored biblical exegesis and educational handbooks. Abraham Mapu authored the first Hebrew full-length novel, &quot;Ahavat Zion&quot; &quot;Love of Zion&quot;, which was published in 1853 after twenty-three years of work. Judah Leib Gordon was the most eminent poet of his generation and arguably of the &quot;Haskalah&quot; in its entirety. His most famous work was the 1876 epic &quot;Qotzo shel Yodh&quot; (Tittle of a Jot). Mendele Mocher Sforim was during his youth a Maskilic writer but from his 1886 &quot;Beseter ra&#x27;am&quot; (), (Hidden in Thunder), he abandoned its strict conventions in favour of a mixed, facile and common style. His career marked the end of the Maskilic period in Hebrew literature and the beginning of the Era of Renaissance. The writers of the latter period lambasted their Maskilic predecessors for their didactic and florid style, more or less paralleling the Romantics&#x27; criticism of Enlightenment literature.

The central platforms of the Maskilic &quot;Republic of Letters&quot; were its great periodicals, each serving as a locus for contributors and readers during the time it was published. The first was the Königsberg (and later Berlin)-based &quot;Ha-Meassef&quot;, launched by Isaac Abraham Euchel in 1783 and printed with growing intervals until 1797. The magazine had several dozen writers and 272 subscribers at its zenith, from Shklow in the east to London in the west, making it the sounding board of the Berlin &quot;Haskalah&quot;. The movement lacked an equivalent until the appearance of &quot;Bikurei ha-I&#x27;tim&quot; in Vienna between 1820 until 1831, serving the Moravian and Galician &quot;Haskalah&quot;. That function was later fulfilled by the Prague-based &quot;Kerem Hemed&quot; from 1834 to 1857, and to a lesser degree by &quot;Kokhvei Yizhak&quot;, published in the same city from 1845 to 1870. The Russian &quot;Haskalah&quot; was robust enough to lack any single platform. Its members published several large magazines, including the Vilnius-based &quot;Ha-Karmel&quot; (1860–1880), &quot;Ha-Tsefirah&quot; in Warsaw and more, though the probably most influential of them all was &quot;Ha-Melitz&quot;, launched in 1860 at Odessa by Aleksander Zederbaum.

===Reforming movement===
While the partisans of the &quot;Haskalah&quot; were much immersed in the study of sciences and Hebrew grammar, this was not a profoundly new phenomenon, and their creativity was a continuation of a long, centuries-old trend among educated Jews. What truly marked the movement was the challenge it laid to the monopoly of the rabbinic elite over the intellectual sphere of Jewish life, contesting its role as spiritual leadership. In his 1782 circular &quot;Divrei Shalom v&#x27;Emeth&quot; (Words of Peace and Truth), Hartwig Wessely, one of the most traditional and moderate &quot;maskilim&quot;, quoted the passage from Leviticus Rabbah stating that a Torah scholar who lacked wisdom was inferior to an animal&#x27;s carcass. He called upon the Jews to introduce general subjects, like science and vernacular language, into their children&#x27;s curriculum; this &quot;Teaching of Man&quot; was necessarily linked with the &quot;Teaching (&quot;Torah&quot;) of God&quot;, and the latter, though superior, could not be pursued and was useless without the former.

Historian Shmuel Feiner discerned that Wessely insinuated (consciously or not) a direct challenge to the supremacy of sacred teachings, comparing them with general subjects and implying the latter had an intrinsic rather than merely instrumental value. He therefore also contested the authority of the rabbinical establishment, which stemmed from its function as interpreters of the holy teachings and their status as the only truly worthy field of study. Though secular subjects could be and were easily tolerated, their elevation to the same level as sacred ones was a severe threat, and indeed mobilized the rabbis against the nascent &quot;Haskalah&quot;. The potential of &quot;Words of Peace and Truth&quot; was fully realized later, by the second generation of the movement in Berlin and other radical &quot;maskilim&quot;, who openly and vehemently denounced the traditional authorities. The appropriate intellectual and moral leadership needed by the Jewish public in modern times was, according to the &quot;maskilim&quot;, that of their own. Feiner noted that in their usurpation of the title of spiritual elite, unprecedented in Jewish history since the dawn of Rabbinic Judaism (various contestants before the Enlightened were branded as schismatics and cast out), they very much emulated the manner in which secular intellectuals dethroned and replaced the Church from the same status among Christians. Thus the &quot;maskilim&quot; generated an upheaval which – though by no means alone – broke the sway held by the rabbis and the traditional values over Jewish society. Combined with many other factors, they laid the path to all modern Jewish movements and philosophies, either those critical, hostile or supportive to themselves.

The &quot;maskilim&quot; sought to replace the framework of values held by the Ashkenazim of Central and Eastern Europe with their own philosophy, which embraced the liberal, rationalistic notions of the 18th and 19th centuries and cast them in their own particular mold. This intellectual upheaval was accompanied by the desire to practically change Jewish society. Even the moderate &quot;maskilim&quot; viewed the contemporary state of Jews as deplorable and in dire need of rejuvenation, whether in matters of morals, cultural creativity or economic productivity. They argued that such conditions were rightfully scorned by others and untenable from both practical and idealistic perspectives. It was to be remedied by the shedding of the base and corrupt elements of Jewish existence and retention of only the true, positive ones; indeed, the question what those were, exactly, loomed as the greatest challenge of Jewish modernity.

The more extreme and ideologically bent came close to the universalist aspirations of the radical Enlightenment, of a world freed of superstition and backwardness in which all humans will come together under the liberating influence of reason and progress. The reconstituted Jews, these radical &quot;maskilim&quot; believed, would be able to take their place as equals in an enlightened world. But all, including the moderate and disillusioned, stated that adjustment to the changing world was both unavoidable and positive in itself.

&quot;Haskalah&quot; ideals were converted into practical steps via numerous reform programs initiated locally and independently by its activists, acting in small groups or even alone at every time and area. Members of the movement sought to acquaint their people with European culture, have them adopt the vernacular language of their lands, and integrate them into larger society. They opposed Jewish reclusiveness and self-segregation, called upon Jews to discard traditional dress in favour of the prevalent one, and preached patriotism and loyalty to the new centralized governments. They acted to weaken and limit the jurisdiction of traditional community institutions – the rabbinic courts, empowered to rule on numerous civic matters, and the board of elders, which served as lay leadership. The maskilim perceived those as remnants of medieval discrimination. They criticized various traits of Jewish society, such as child marriage – traumatized memories from unions entered at the age of thirteen or fourteen are a common theme in Haskalah literature – the use of anathema to enforce community will and the concentration on virtually only religious studies.

Maskilic reforms included educational efforts. In 1778, partisans of the movement were among the founders of the Berlin Jewish Free School, or &quot;Hevrat Hinuch Ne&#x27;arim&quot; (Society for the Education of Boys), the first institution in Ashkenazi Jewry that taught general studies in addition to the reformulated and reduced traditional curriculum. This model, with different stresses, was applied elsewhere. Joseph Perl opened the first modern Jewish school in Galicia at Tarnopol in 1813, and Eastern European &quot;maskilim&quot; opened similar institutes in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland. They all abandoned the received methods of Ashkenazi education: study of the Pentateuch with the archaic &quot;I&#x27;vri-Taitsch&quot; (medieval Yiddish) translation and an exclusive focus on the Talmud as a subject of higher learning, all presided over by old-school tutors, &quot;melamdim&quot;, who were particularly reviled in maskilic circles. Those were replaced by teachers trained in modern methods, among others in the spirit of German philanthropinism, who sought to acquaint their pupils with refined Hebrew so they may understand the Pentateuch and prayers and thus better identify with their heritage; ignorance of Hebrew was often lamented by &quot;maskilim&quot; as breeding apathy towards Judaism. Far less Talmud, considered cumbersome and ill-suited for children, was taught; elements considered superstitious, like &quot;midrashim&quot;, were also removed. Matters of faith were taught in rationalistic spirit, and in radical circles also in a sanitized manner. On the other hand, the curriculum was augmented by general studies like math, vernacular language, and so forth.

In the linguistic field, the &quot;maskilim&quot; wished to replace the dualism which characterized the traditional Ashkenazi community, which spoke Judaeo-German and its formal literary language was Hebrew, with another: a refined Hebrew for internal usage and the local vernacular for external ones. They almost universally abhorred Judaeo-German, regarding it as a corrupt dialect and another symptom of Jewish destitution – the movement pioneered the negative attitude to Yiddish which persisted many years later among the educated – though often its activists had to resort to it for lack of better medium to address the masses. Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn, for example, authored the first modern Judaeo-German play, &quot;Leichtsinn und Frömmelei&quot; (Rashness and Sanctimony) in 1796. On the economic front, the &quot;maskilim&quot; preached productivization and abandonment of traditional Jewish occupations in favour of agriculture, trades and liberal professions.

In matters of faith (which were being cordoned off into a distinct sphere of &quot;religion&quot; by modernization pressures) the movement&#x27;s partisans, from moderates to radicals, lacked any uniform coherent agenda. The main standard through which they judged Judaism was that of rationalism. Their most important contribution was the revival of Jewish philosophy, rather dormant since the Italian Renaissance, as an alternative to mysticist &quot;Kabbalah&quot; which served as almost the sole system of thought among Ashkenazim and an explanatory system for observance. Rather than complex allegorical exegesis, the &quot;Haskalah&quot; sought a literal understanding of scripture and sacred literature. The rejection of &quot;Kabbalah&quot;, often accompanied with attempts to refute the ancientness of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, were extremely controversial in traditional society; apart from that, the &quot;maskilim&quot; had little in common. On the right-wing were conservative members of the rabbinic elite who merely wanted a rationalist approach, and on the extreme left some ventured far beyond the pale of orthodoxy towards Deism.

Another aspect was the movement&#x27;s attitude to gender relations. Many of the &quot;maskilim&quot; were raised in the rabbinic elite, in which (unlike among the poor Jewish masses or the rich communal wardens) the males were immersed in traditional studies and their wives supported them financially, mostly by running business. Many of the Jewish enlightened were traumatized by their own experiences, either of assertive mothers or early marriage, often conducted at the age of thirteen. Bitter memories from those are a common theme in &quot;maskilic&quot; autobiographies. Having imbibed the image of European bourgeoisie family values, many of them sought to challenge the semi-matriarchal order of rabbinic families – which combined a lack of Jewish education for women with granting them the status of providers – early marriage, and rigid modesty. Instead, they insisted that men become economically productive while confining their wives to the home environment but also granting them proper religious education, reversing Jewish custom and copying contemporary Christian attitudes.

===Transitory phenomena===
The &quot;Haskalah&quot; was also mainly a movement of transformation, straddling both the declining traditional Jewish society of autonomous community and cultural seclusion and the beginnings of a modern Jewish public. As noted by Feiner, everything connected with the &quot;Haskalah&quot; was dualistic in nature. The Jewish Enlighteners pursued two parallel agendas: they exhorted the Jews to acculturate and harmonize with the modern state, and demanded that the Jews remain a distinct group with its own culture and identity. Theirs was a middle position between Jewish community and surrounding society, received mores and modernity. Sliding away from this precarious equilibrium, in any direction, signified also one&#x27;s break with the Jewish Enlightenment.

Virtually all &quot;maskilim&quot; received old-style, secluded education, and were young Torah scholars before they were first exposed to outside knowledge (from a gender perspective, the movement was almost totally male-dominated; women did not receive sufficient tutoring to master Hebrew). For generations, Mendelssohn&#x27;s Bible translation to German was employed by such young initiates to bridge the linguistic gap and learn a foreign language, having been raised on Hebrew and Yiddish only. The experience of abandoning one&#x27;s sheltered community and struggle with tradition was a ubiquitous trait of &quot;maskilic&quot; biographies. The children of these activists almost never followed their parents; they rather went forward in the path of acculturation and assimilation. While their fathers learned the vernaculars late and still consumed much Hebrew literature, the little available material in the language did not attract their offspring, who often lacked a grasp of Hebrew due to not sharing their parents&#x27; traditional education. &quot;Haskalah&quot; was, by and large, a unigenerational experience.

In the linguistic field, this transitory nature was well attested. The traditional Jewish community in Europe inhabited two separate spheres of communication: one internal, where Hebrew served as written high language and Yiddish as vernacular for the masses, and one external, where Latin and the like were used for apologetic and intercessory purposes toward the Christian world. A tiny minority of writers was concerned with the latter. The &quot;Haskalah&quot; sought to introduce a different bilingualism: renovated, refined Hebrew for internal matters, while Yiddish was to be eliminated; and national vernaculars, to be taught to all Jews, for external ones. However, they insisted on the maintenance of both spheres. When acculturation far exceeded the movement&#x27;s plans, Central European Jews turned almost solely to the vernacular. David Sorkin demonstrated this with the two great journals of German Jewry: the maskilic &quot;Ha-Me&#x27;assef&quot; was written in Hebrew and supported the study of German; the post-maskilic &quot;Sulamith&quot; (published since 1806) was written almost entirely in German, befitting its editors&#x27; agenda of linguistic assimilation. Likewise, upon the demise of Jewish Enlightenment in Eastern Europe, authors abandoned the &quot;maskilic&quot; paradigm not toward assimilation but in favour of exclusive use of Hebrew and Yiddish.

The political vision of the &quot;Haskalah&quot; was predicated on a similar approach. It opposed the reclusive community of the past but sought a maintenance of a strong Jewish framework (with themselves as leaders and intercessors with the state authorities); the Enlightened were not even fully agreeable to civic emancipation, and many of them viewed it with reserve, sometimes anxiety. In their writings, they drew a sharp line between themselves and whom they termed &quot;pseudo-&quot;maskilim&quot;&quot; – those who embraced the Enlightenment values and secular knowledge but did not seek to balance these with their Jewishness, but rather strove for full assimilation. Such elements, whether the radical universalists who broke off the late Berlin &quot;Haskalah&quot; or the Russified intelligentsia in Eastern Europe a century later, were castigated and derided no less than the old rabbinic authorities which the movement confronted. It was not uncommon for its partisans to become a conservative element, combating against further dilution of tradition: in Vilnius, Samuel Joseph Fuenn turned from a progressive into an adversary of more radical elements within a generation. In the Maghreb, the few local &quot;maskilim&quot; were more concerned with the rapid assimilation of local Jews into the colonial French culture than with the ills of traditional society.

Likewise, those who abandoned the optimistic, liberal vision of the Jews (albeit as a cohesive community) integrating into wider society in favour of full-blown Jewish nationalism or radical, revolutionary ideologies which strove to uproot the established order like Socialism, also broke with the &quot;Haskalah&quot;. The Jewish national movements of Eastern Europe, founded by disillusioned &quot;maskilim&quot;, derisively regarded it – in a manner similar to other romantic-nationalist movements&#x27; understanding of the general Enlightenment – as a naive, liberal and assimilationist ideology which induced foreign cultural influences, gnawed at the Jewish national consciousness and promised false hopes of equality in exchange for spiritual enslavement. This hostile view was promulgated by nationalist thinkers and historians, from Peretz Smolenskin, Ahad Ha&#x27;am, Simon Dubnow and onwards. It was once common in Israeli historiography.

A major factor which always characterized the movement was its weakness and its dependence of much more powerful elements. Its partisans were mostly impoverished intellectuals, who eked out a living as private tutors and the like; few had a stable financial base, and they required patrons, whether affluent Jews or the state&#x27;s institutions. This triplice – the authorities, the Jewish communal elite, and the &quot;maskilim&quot; – was united only in the ambition of thoroughly reforming Jewish society. The government had no interest in the visions of renaissance which the Enlightened so fervently cherished. It demanded the Jews to turn into productive, loyal subjects with rudimentary secular education, and no more. The rich Jews were sometimes open to the movement&#x27;s agenda, but mostly practical, hoping for a betterment of their people that would result in emancipation and equal rights. Indeed, the great cultural transformation which occurred among the &quot;Parnassim&quot; (affluent communal wardens) class – they were always more open to outside society, and had to tutor their children in secular subjects, thus inviting general Enlightenment influences – was a precondition of &quot;Haskalah&quot;. The state and the elite required the &quot;maskilim&quot; as interlocutors and specialists in their efforts for reform, especially as educators, and the latter used this as leverage to benefit their ideology. However, the activists were much more dependent on the former than vice versa; frustration from one&#x27;s inability to further the &quot;maskilic&quot; agenda and being surrounded by apathetic Jews, either conservative &quot;fanatics&quot; or parvenu &quot;assimilationists&quot;, is a common theme in the movement&#x27;s literature.

The term &quot;Haskalah&quot; became synonymous, among friends and foes alike and in much of early Jewish historiography, with the sweeping changes that engulfed Jewish society (mostly in Europe) from the late 18th century to the late 19th century. It was depicted by its partisans, adversaries and historians like Heinrich Graetz as a major factor in those; Feiner noted that &quot;every modern Jew was identified as a &quot;maskil&quot; and every change in traditional religious patterns was dubbed &quot;Haskalah&quot;&quot;. Later research greatly narrowed the scope of the phenomenon and limited its importance: while &quot;Haskalah&quot; undoubtedly played a part, the contemporary historical consensus portrays it as much humbler. Other transformation agents, from state-imposed schools to new economic opportunities, were demonstrated to have rivaled or overshadowed the movement completely in propelling such processes as acculturation, secularization, religious reform from moderate to extreme, adoption of native patriotism and so forth. In many regions the &quot;Haskalah&quot; had no effect at all.

== Origins ==

As long as the Jews lived in segregated communities, and as long as all social interaction with their gentile neighbors was limited, the rabbi was the most influential member of the Jewish community. In addition to being a religious scholar and &quot;clergy&quot;, a rabbi also acted as a civil judge in all cases in which both parties were Jews. Rabbis sometimes had other important administrative powers, together with the community elders. The rabbinate was the highest aim of many Jewish boys, and the study of the Talmud was the means of obtaining that coveted position, or one of many other important communal distinctions. Haskalah followers advocated &quot;coming out of the ghetto&quot;, not just physically but also mentally and spiritually, in order to assimilate among gentile nations.

The example of Moses Mendelssohn (1729–86), a Prussian Jew, served to lead this movement, which was also shaped by Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn (1754–1835) and Joseph Perl (1773–1839). Mendelssohn&#x27;s extraordinary success as a popular philosopher and man of letters revealed hitherto unsuspected possibilities of integration and acceptance of Jews among non-Jews. Mendelssohn also provided methods for Jews to enter the general society of Germany. A good knowledge of the German language was necessary to secure entrance into cultured German circles, and an excellent means of acquiring it was provided by Mendelssohn in his German translation of the Torah. This work became a bridge over which ambitious young Jews could pass to the great world of secular knowledge. The &quot;Biur&quot;, or grammatical commentary, prepared under Mendelssohn&#x27;s supervision, was designed to counteract the influence of traditional rabbinical methods of exegesis. Together with the translation, it became, as it were, the primer of Haskalah.

Language played a key role in the haskalah movement, as Mendelssohn and others called for a revival of Hebrew and a reduction in the use of Yiddish. The result was an outpouring of new, secular literature, as well as critical studies of religious texts. Julius Fürst along with other German-Jewish scholars compiled Hebrew and Aramaic dictionaries and grammars. Jews also began to study and communicate in the languages of the countries in which they settled, providing another gateway for integration.

Berlin was the city of origin for the movement. The capital city of Prussia and, later, the German Empire, Berlin became known as a secular, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic center, a fertile environment for conversations and radical movements. This move by the Maskilim away from religious study, into much more critical and worldly studies was made possible by this German city of modern and progressive thought. It was a city in which the rising middle class Jews and intellectual elites not only lived among, but were exposed to previous Age of Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau. The movement is often referred to as the &quot;Berlin Haskalah&quot;. Reference to Berlin in relation to the Haskalah movement is necessary because it provides context for this episode of Jewish history. Subsequently, having left Germany and spreading across Eastern Europe, the &quot;Berlin Haskalah&quot; influenced multiple Jewish communities who were interested in non-religious scholarly texts and insight to worlds beyond their Jewish enclaves.

==Spread==

Haskalah did not stay restricted to Germany, however, and the movement quickly spread throughout Europe. Poland–Lithuania was the heartland of Rabbinic Judaism, with its two streams of Misnagdic Talmudism centred primarily in Lithuania and Belarus, and Hasidic mysticism popular in Ukraine, Poland, Hungary and Russia. In the 19th century, Haskalah sought dissemination and transformation of traditional education and inward pious life in Eastern Europe. It adapted its message to these different environments, working with the Russian government of the Pale of Settlement to influence secular educational methods, while its writers satirised Hasidic mysticism, in favour of solely Rationalist interpretation of Judaism. Isaac Baer Levinsohn (1788–1860) became known as the &quot;Russian Mendelssohn&quot;. Joseph Perl&#x27;s (1773–1839) satire of the Hasidic movement, &quot;Revealer of Secrets&quot; (Megalleh Temirim), is said to be the first modern novel in Hebrew. It was published in Vienna in 1819 under the pseudonym &quot;Obadiah ben Pethahiah&quot;. The Haskalah&#x27;s message of integration into non-Jewish society was subsequently counteracted by alternative secular Jewish political movements advocating Folkish, Socialist or Nationalist secular Jewish identities in Eastern Europe. While Haskalah advocated Hebrew and sought to remove Yiddish, these subsequent developments advocated Yiddish Renaissance among Maskilim. Writers of Yiddish literature variously satirised or sentimentalised Hasidic mysticism.

==Effects==
The Haskalah also resulted in the creation of a secular Jewish culture, with an emphasis on Jewish history and Jewish identity, rather than on religion. This, in turn, resulted in the political engagement of Jews in a variety of competing ways within the countries where they lived on issues that included
* the struggle for Jewish emancipation 
* involvement in new Jewish political movements, and 
* later (in the face of continued persecutions in late nineteenth-century Europe), the development of Zionism.

One commentator describes these effects as &quot;The emancipation of the Jews brought forth two opposed movements: the cultural assimilation, begun by Moses Mendelssohn, and Zionism, founded by Theodor Herzl in 1896.&quot;

One facet of the Haskalah was a widespread cultural adaptation, as those Jews who participated in the enlightenment began, in varying degrees, to participate in the cultural practices of the surrounding gentile population. Connected with this was the birth of the Reform movement, whose founders (such as Israel Jacobson and Leopold Zunz) rejected the continuing observance of those aspects of Jewish law which they classified as ritual—as opposed to moral or ethical. Even within orthodoxy, the Haskalah was felt through the appearance, in response, of the Mussar Movement in Lithuania, and &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; in Germany. &quot;Enlightened&quot; Jews sided with gentile governments, in plans to increase secular education and assimilation among the Jewish masses, which brought them into acute conflict with the orthodox, who believed this threatened the traditional Jewish lifestyle – which had up until that point been maintained through segregation from their gentile neighbors – and Jewish identity itself.

The spread of Haskalah affected Judaism, as a religion, because of the degree to which different sects desired to be integrated, and in turn, integrate their religious traditions. The effects of the Enlightenment were already present in Jewish religious music, and in opinion on the tension between traditionalist and modernist tendencies. Groups of Reform Jews, including the Society of the Friends of Reform and the Association for the Reform of Judaism were formed, because such groups wanted, and actively advocated for, a change in Jewish tradition, in particular, regarding rituals like circumcision. Another non-Orthodox group was the Conservative Jews, who emphasized the importance of traditions but viewed with a historical perspective. The Orthodox Jews were actively against these reformers because they viewed changing Jewish tradition as an insult to God and believed that fulfillment in life could be found in serving God and keeping his commandments. The effect of Haskalah was that it gave a voice to plurality of views, while the orthodoxy preserved the tradition, even to the point of insisting on dividing between sects.

Another important facet of the Haskalah was its interest in non-Jewish religions, and for some the desire to synchronize or appreciate Christian and Islamic traditions and history. Moses Mendelssohn criticized some aspects of Christianity, but depicted Jesus as a Torah-observant rabbi, who was loyal to traditional Judaism. Mendelssohn explicitly linked positive Jewish views of Jesus with the issues of Emancipation and Jewish-Christian reconciliation. Similar revisionist views were expressed by Rabbi Isaac Ber Levinsohn and other traditional representatives of the Haskalah movement.

<text>The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. Based on the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; books by authors A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard, &quot;The New Adventures&quot; was the first time a major Disney character headlined an animated, made-for-television series as well as the first Disney television series based on a major animated film. The cartoon premiered with a limited run on The Disney Channel on January 17, 1988. Nine months later, the show moved to ABC as part of their Saturday morning lineup. New episodes continued until October 26, 1991. Proving popular with children and older fans, it remained a staple on television in the United States for nearly two decades.

Publications ranging from &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; to &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the series extremely positive reviews for its resemblance to the earlier Disney efforts and its high production quality, receiving praise for its wholesome tradition. The show won back-to-back Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program as well as two Humanitas Prizes. The show was well received by both children and their parents. Most of the viewer mail the crew received were from parents thanking the staff for producing a show that they can watch with their children. &quot;The New Adventures&quot; is credited with bringing about a resurgence of &quot;Pooh&quot; animated media, including a series of television and video specials.

==Premise==
The series depicts the everyday lives of Christopher Robin and his 9 companions Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Kanga, Roo, Rabbit, Eeyore, Owl and Gopher. Rather than a straightforward adaptation, the show was more Americanized than previous &quot;Pooh&quot; efforts. Episodes dealt with strong messages about honesty, responsibility, persistence, cooperative effort, friendship, and caring. Many stories are designed to help young children distinguish between fantasy and reality and overcome common childhood fears.

==Characters==

* Winnie the Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the main character. Pooh is very naive yet lovable and is always good-natured. Cummings called the program timeless.
* Piglet (voiced by John Fiedler) is Pooh&#x27;s best friend. Piglet is shy, very kind-hearted and is obsessed with keeping things neat and tidy, and enjoys beautiful things like flowers. His fears and nervousness often hinder his life, as Piglet runs and hides when unnecessary and often stutters when nervous, but has been shown to have a lot of hidden courage and often faces danger to help others. Piglet sometimes has an inferiority complex, although his friends think highly of him. Episodes about him tend to revolve around these traits as well as his small size. Fiedler is one of the only members of the original cast involved.
* Tigger (voiced by Paul Winchell in Seasons 1–2 and Jim Cummings in Seasons 3–4) is an ebullient tiger. Tigger is always filled with great energy and optimism, and though always well-meaning, Tigger can also be mischievous, and his actions have sometimes led to chaos and trouble for himself and his friends. Tigger is very confident and has quite an ego, having a high opinion of himself. Tigger has a notable habit of mispronouncing various words, or stressing wrong syllables in them. Unlike previous adaptations, Tigger is shown living in a large treehouse. Winchell thought of him as a cross between the Dead End Kids and the Cowardly Lion. He is one of the only members of the original cast involved.
* Eeyore (voiced by Peter Cullen) is a gloomy donkey. Eeyore is somewhat less caustic and sarcastic in this version than in the original stories. Despite his depressive nature, Eeyore is capable of great compassion. Eeyore usually expects misfortune to happen to him, such as his house of sticks to be knocked down regularly, but accepts it when it does.
* Kanga (voiced by Patricia Parris) is Roo&#x27;s mother. Kanga rarely appears, but is shown to be kindhearted and calm.
* Roo (voiced by Nicholas Melody) is a young joey. Roo wears a light blue shirt. The smallest of the characters, Roo frequently is seen hanging around Tigger.
* Rabbit (voiced by Ken Sansom) is a sarcastic and finicky rabbit. In addition to wanting to be organized and practical, Rabbit&#x27;s tendency to take charge is inflated to the extent that Rabbit becomes a control freak who insists on doing things exactly right, in his way and in the proper order. Rabbit keeps a garden and does whatever he can to protect it from other animals such as bugs and crows, often getting upset when anyone or anything tries to steal his vegetables. Rabbit and Tigger are usually foils for each other, reluctantly working together. Rabbit was shown as pale green in the series, compared to yellow in later efforts.
* Owl (voiced by Hal Smith) is the eldest character in the series. Owl presents himself as a mentor and teacher to the others, but is really quite scatterbrained. Owl enjoys telling stories about his distant relatives, whenever something reminds him of one, but many of his stories are pointless or absurd. Owl speaks with a strong Southern English accent. Smith is one of the only members of the original cast involved.
* Gopher (voiced by Michael Gough) is a hard-working gopher who lives underground. Gopher is shown to be a bit of a workaholic, and is obsessed with dynamite and digging in his tunnels. Gopher speaks with a Southern accent, mostly whistles his &quot;S&#x27;s&quot; and wears a helmet with a light attached. Gopher often helps the others out with construction plans.
* Christopher Robin (voiced by Tim Hoskins) is a young boy that has adventures with the stuffed animals.
For the most part, the show used a limited cast consisting only of characters in the original Milne books, with the notable exception of the Disney-created character Gopher. However, several minor characters did make appearances. Christopher Robin&#x27;s mother is shown occasionally, but always with her face obscured.
Kessie, a female bluebird that Rabbit rescues, makes her first appearance in this series; Kessie would later appear in &quot;The Book of Pooh&quot;. Stan Woozle and Heff Heffalump appear as a pair of honey thieves. This marked the first time heffalumps and woozles were seen on-screen. Prior to this, heffalumps and woozles had always been portrayed as creatures that did not exist and were representative of childhood fears. Instead, the show used other unseen villains such as Jagulars and the &quot;Grab-Me Gotcha.&quot; Papa Heffalump also appeared from time to time. Other characters on the show include Owl&#x27;s cousin Dexter (voiced by Hal Smith) and Skippy the Sheepdog. Chuck McCann provided additional voices as well.

==Episodes==

==History==
===Origin===
Winnie the Pooh was created by British authors A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard in the 1920s. The character was named after a teddy bear owned by Milne&#x27;s son, Christopher Robin Milne. He had named his toy bear after Winnie, a Canadian black bear he often saw at London Zoo, and &quot;Pooh&quot;, a swan they had met while on holiday. Drawing from this and other toys owned by his son, Milne created the world of Winnie-the-Pooh. He first appeared by name on December 24, 1925, in a Christmas story commissioned and published by the London Evening News. The following year, a collection of Pooh stories was formally released bearing the name &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. The stories proved very popular and inspired a sequel.

The idea for a television series was first discussed in 1957. NBC suggested Jay Ward undertake the pilot, then titled &quot;The World of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, with an option for thirty-nine episodes. Some songs and bits of dialogue were recorded, but the project was ultimately abandoned. In 1961, Disney&#x27;s namesake founder Walt Disney purchased the film rights to make an animated movie starring the characters. He subsequently produced a series of three short featurettes throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, beginning with &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; (1966). Disney had also aired a variety show with the characters that used electronically controlled puppetry and life-sized costume titled &quot;Welcome to Pooh Corner&quot;. This became the highest rated program on the Disney Channel. The original featurettes also proved popular, with video sales topping the charts in 1986 and 1987.

===Development===

An animated cartoon starring the characters was first proposed by Walt Disney Television Animation Vice President Gary Krisel during a Disney retreat, in which company assets and future prospects were examined. Rich Frank later recalled him saying: &quot;I think Pooh is a great character for Saturday morning animation&quot;. He believed the merchandising license, held at that time by Sears, would work as a great promotional tool. Mark Zaslove was contacted to write the series bible; he had recently finished work on the &quot;DuckTales&quot; pilot episode. The document was written over Memorial Day weekend 1987, with Zaslove having only three days to complete the proposal. The pitch was well received by Disney and subsequently green-lit.

Instead of shopping &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; around to different networks, the show was pitched directly to ABC. The channel had desperately wanted a cartoon from Disney for their Saturday morning schedule, which had fallen to last place in the ratings. They had hoped Pooh could boost ratings for the channel. Two years earlier, Michael Eisner and Krisel had set up meetings with all three major networks in hopes to sell rights to their two cartoon series: &quot;Disney&#x27;s Wuzzles&quot; and &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;. CBS and NBC had purchased &quot;Wuzzles&quot; and &quot;Gummi Bears&quot; respectively. Realizing they had nothing left to offer ABC, Eisner and Krisel met with them anyway and received a warm response to the gaffe. A deal was reached giving ABC the show, while giving first run rights to The Disney Channel.

The show was official announced via a press release on November 15, 1987. It would mark the first time a prominent Disney character was seen on Saturday morning television. The series was viewed as a gamble, with people unsure if Pooh would survive on the new medium. At the time, Saturday morning cartoons were viewed as a place with dry, repetitive storylines, shallow characters, clichéd narratives, and cheap animation. As a result, animation fans greeted Disney&#x27;s plans to adapt A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard&#x27;s childhood favorite to the small screen with a mixture of skepticism and dismay, fearing the show could not top the original featurettes.

===Production===

ABC eagerly commissioned 25 half-hour episodes of &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; for its first season, rather than the standard 13 to 17. Karl Geurs, a self-described Pooh fan, developed the series, which took many months. At the time, Walt Disney Television Animation had only 80 employees and two projects in production. The department did not yet have in-house facilities built, so employees worked out of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences building. Disney put the same high standards of expectation that they had with their feature films. They had hoped to set a new standard of excellence in Saturday morning television, one with &quot;storytelling rich in language and values, as well as delightful well acted characters&quot; that would appeal to audiences of all ages.
The writing process began with story premises being pitched to Zaslove, who served as story editor for the first season. The best ones were selected and sent to ABC executives for approval, followed by story outlines and scripts. The process took around four weeks per episode. The crew were &quot;dyed-in-the-wool&quot; fan of Milne&#x27;s works, constantly checking their work against published &quot;Pooh&quot; books in order to stay true to the original sense of Milne. Special attention was given to maintain the personalities of the characters as they had originally been written. The cartoon attempted to have the right balance of both action-adventure sequences and moments of whimsy. The staff often found trouble working with the limited cast, with supervising director Ken Kessel quoted as saying: &quot;You are restrained by what the characters can do and who they are&quot;. The writing staff hoped to channel the spirit of the Walt Disney shorts of the 1940s, drawing inspiration from artists Jack Hannah, Ward Kimball, and Jack and Dick Kinney.

The series had one internal standards director. Care was made to ensure there was no imitable behavior that children could copy. A source of friction on the show was whether Gopher was allowed to have gunpowder. A consulting company based in Glendale, California advised the team on how the characters should speak, look, and act in order to better appeal to the target demographic. The relationship with the production staff was described as positive.

Like most other cartoons, the animation was outsourced to other countries. This was mainly done for cost purposes and the limited availability of artists in the United States. All the writing, music, direction, character design, and color was worked by around 30 Disney employees in Hollywood. After this, everything was sent overseas for the animation. Approximately 300 employees would work on inking and printing. An unusually high number of animation cels were used for the show, with 20,000 cels in each episode as opposed to 8,000–12,000 for typical cartoons. The show had more drawings per minute than any other television cartoon at the time. Early episodes were completed by TMS Entertainment in Tokyo, Japan and later by Walt Disney Animation UK Ltd. in London, England, Hanho Heung-Up in Seoul, South Korea and Wang Film Productions in Taipei, Taiwan. Sixteen episodes were also produced by Walt Disney Television Australia in Sydney, New South Wales. The show set a benchmark for similar cartoons that both Disney as well as other channels expected for future shows. In Manila, Philippines, Fil-Cartoons (subsidiary of Hanna-Barbera) and Toon City also contributed some animation for the series.

After the animation was completed, the production reels were sent back to the United States where music and sound effects were added. The show&#x27;s theme song, entitled &quot;Pooh Bear&quot;, was written by Steve Nelson and sung by Steve Wood. A version with Nelson doing the vocals later appeared on his &quot;Listen What the Katmandu&quot; album. Another version of the song with Jim Cummings doing the vocals (who also voiced Pooh and Tigger) appeared in reruns of the series on Disney Channel in 1994. Nelson also composed several additional songs that were shown on the early episodes. The music was particularly praised by critics. The show&#x27;s underscore was composed by Thom Sharp. An orchestra was used to record the music, using instruments such as trumpets, woodwinds, and a full string section. The composers were given the unique opportunity to examine the animator&#x27;s exposure sheets, enabling them to write music while an episode was being scripted.

===Casting===
The producers actively sought out the surviving original voice cast which had been used in the 1960s featurettes. Sterling Holloway, the original voice of Winnie the Pooh, read for the part, but had aged to the point where he could no longer do the voice successfully. A casting call was held and Jim Cummings was selected as his replacement, a role he has continued with to the present day. Cummings has claimed that veteran actors such as Burgess Meredith and E. G. Marshall had read for the part of Pooh as well.

Paul Winchell, John Fiedler and Hal Smith, the original voices for Tigger, Piglet, and Owl respectively, returned for the series. On advice from his cardiologist, Winchell mostly avoided recording with the rest of the cast to avoid the stress so the studio allowed him do his voices alone. Meanwhile, Winchell was making various trips to Africa to cure hunger, in which Cummings often understudied for Winchell. Throughout the series, Winchell voiced Tigger in the first two seasons and select episodes of the third season before Cummings took over the role. When Cummings took over, Winchell said: &quot;Take care of my little friend for me.&quot;

Most of the recording sessions occurred at B&amp;B Sound in Burbank, California. Advanced technology allowed for the actors to record their roles without having to be in the same room. For example, Fiedler recorded his role from New York while Winchell recorded some from Florida. Cummings described Fielder&#x27;s voice as &quot;kind of like the wind blowing through tall grass. It sounded homey, and it sounding comforting.&quot; Fiedler stated he was very proud of his work on the show having enjoyed the role as much as when he started in 1968. Ken Sansom was cast as Rabbit, he later described voicing Rabbit in the series as the best professional experience he ever had.

===Promotion===
Coming into the 1988–89 television season, networks had been struggling with a drop in ratings among children. ABC itself experienced a decline of 37 percent in kids under the age of 6. It had been surmised by ABC executives that this was due to a change in the way Nielsen ratings were collected. The data had historically been recorded automatically by a device inside household television sets. However this had been changed the year before; children now had to use people meters for their viewership to be counted. This required manually pushing buttons that would clock kids in and out and programs, something they often had trouble successfully completing. What resulted was a demographic that could not be guaranteed to advertisers.

In order to combat this, ABC decided to fill their programming with &quot;old favorites&quot;. The studio began to develop and retool preexisting characters and shows, ones that they hoped could attract older children and their parents into watching the program. &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; became the centerpiece in this plan, with the show was described as the highlight of ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning schedule. The character had what network executives call &quot;marquee value&quot;—meaning they are familiar and already have a built-in audience. Squire Rushnell, Children&#x27;s Vice President for ABC, was hoping &quot;Pooh&quot; could draw a &quot;somewhat more sophisticated&quot; audience in the range from 6 to 11 years.

In the three weeks leading up to its debut, ABC began airing promotionals for the cartoon during prime-time hours. This was seen as a very unusual occurrence. Part of the reason this was done was to fill airtime, as the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike had caused production to be halted on prime time television shows. Advertisements for &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; were played during adult shows such as &quot;thirtysomething&quot; and &quot;Moonlighting&quot; using the tag line &quot;Now you can share your childhood heroes with your children&quot;. A television commercial that aired during the &quot;ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; on September 4, 1988 used the tagline &quot;before taxes. before puberty. there was childhood. and Winnie the Pooh&quot;.

The evening before the show made its broadcast debut, ABC aired a thirty-minute Saturday Morning preview show featuring Winnie the Pooh and other debuting cartoons: &quot;The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil&quot; and &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot;. The show placed second in its time slot with a 7.3 rating and a 14 share, with 11.2 million viewers watching.

Sears &amp; Roebuck and Honey Nut Cheerios partnered to host a nationwide premiere party to celebrate the series coming to ABC. Over 300 Sears stores across the country participated in the breakfast, which doubled as a charity event. The first episode was telecast on in-store video displays. More than 40,000 children attended the event. Some stores had Winnie the Pooh characters show up in costume. Sears also dedicated eight pages of their Christmas catalog to the series.

===Broadcast history===
During the late 1980s, a debate emerged inside Disney about whether original programs should be aired on the Disney Channel or outsourced to other channels. Some executives felt there was nothing more important than the Disney Channel. Others such as Gary Krisel disagreed, feeling they risked losing a generation of TV viewers who did not have cable. In the end, a compromise was reached with Disney Channel President John F. Cooke, who agreed to &quot;pay&quot; Krisel&#x27;s division a certain price if he could get first run rights. The show premiered on the Disney Channel on January 17, 1988. Thirteen episodes aired at 8:30am on weekends. The show&#x27;s run ended that July.

The show then moved to Saturday morning on ABC where it aired for a full hour from 8:30am to 9:30am. For the second season, the show was cut back to 30 minutes to make room for new entries. The show was merged with &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; and aired as part of the &quot;Gummi Bears-Winnie the Pooh Hour&quot;. This partnership was short-lived and lasted only one year, when &quot;Gummi Bears&quot; moved to The Disney Afternoon. &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; returned as a solo effort the following year. New episodes intermixed with reruns returned for a third season in the fall of 1990. During this time, two of the show&#x27;s characters—Winnie the Pooh and Tigger—were incorporated into the television special &quot;Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue&quot;. The show returned for a fourth season on September 7, 1991. The show was not renewed the following year. After the series ended, the crew produced &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too&quot;, a primetime spin-off of the show.

Despite production ending the year before, reruns of the show continued on ABC&#x27;s fall schedule for the 1992–93 season. By the following year, the show was dropped altogether by ABC and sold in syndication. Executives felt the show could make more money selling directly to television stations rather than accepting ABC&#x27;s license fee. The show returned on ABC in late 1995 when reruns of the program replaced &quot;The New Adventures of Madeline&quot;. It returned again to the ABC lineup on January 4, 1997 and continued until September 7, 2002.

The Disney Channel began airing reruns of the series on October 3, 1994, in the United States. The show also began airing in the channel&#x27;s preschool block, Playhouse Disney, when the block launched on April 1, 1997. These continued until September 1, 2006, at which point it was taken off the channel&#x27;s schedule. Playhouse Disney on the other hand ran it until August 1, 2006, one month before Disney Channel ended its run. It was also shown on Toon Disney, first airing on April 18, 1998, and ran until October 19, 2007. After Toon Disney&#x27;s final run of the series, the show hasn&#x27;t been seen in the United States since then. Internationally, the show has aired in several countries including Seven Network (later The Disney Channel) in Australia, CITV (later The Disney Channel) in the United Kingdom, TF1 in France, Super RTL in Germany, Rai 1 and Rai 2 in Italy, TV Tokyo (later Disney Channel, Tokyo MX, Toon Disney, , Disney Junior, and NHK BS Premium) in Japan, SBT (later Disney Weekend, Disney Channel and Claro TV&#x27;s channel) in Brazil, and the Family Channel in Canada, India, and Poland.

==Setting==
For this adaptation, the show underwent an Americanization. The setting was changed from native England to America. The series depicted Christopher Robin as a typical 1980s-1990s kid rather than a 1920s British child. He is shown living in a suburban house with his mother and no longer had an English accent. His mischievous imagination drew comparisons to Calvin from &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, as opposed to Milne&#x27;s original interpretation. Additionally, unlike the earlier Disney featurettes, the show did not use a narrator or the storybook theme.

Although the show still used the Hundred Acre Wood as its main setting, several episodes took place in other locations. The characters occasionally traveled to the adjacent town, going to a grocery store or movie theater. Other episodes were set in more imaginative settings and involved the characters journeying into the clouds or down in a wishing well. Two episodes took place in the Wild West, one in the form of a play. These styles of episodes were done away with later on. The writing staff felt they worked best in the Hundred Acre Wood.

The writers made a point of keeping the show as timeless as possible, having the Hundred Acre Wood become a &quot;never, never land&quot;. The show did its best to leave out all the 1980s and 1990s conveniences. The approach to episodes was to put more emphasis on adventure, yet keep the integrity of Milne&#x27;s characters. To add excitement, the occasional waterfall or cliff was added, which the show found tough to fit in. Its dialogue was updated to make the show more relatable to younger generations.

==Themes and analysis==
The show was a conceived as a comedy of manners and was hailed as a rare cartoon devoid of any violence or villains. The show&#x27;s main theme revolved around the complications and misunderstandings that often arose between the characters and their eventual return to normalcy. For instance, one episode dealt with Pooh believing Rabbit was moving away after hearing he had &quot;eaten him out of house and [honey]&quot;. Special attention was paid to write from a child&#x27;s point of view, rather than an adult&#x27;s. For this, the writers drew inspiration from Bill Cosby, Gahan Wilson, and &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;. Additionally, the staff was also very conscious of their older viewers—dubbed &quot;older kids&quot;—and would always aim for a sensibility that would appeal to them as well. Kessel noted that while the show often had writing that would go over the heads of little kids, the original Milne books did as well.

Unlike previous adaptations of &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, the stories were for the most part not based on chapters from A. A. Milne&#x27;s books. The writers made a point of not copying from Milne, but instead drawing the essence of him for the modern day; keeping the same charm and style as the original stories. The episodes have very little action in terms of plot, which in later years has drawn comparisons to &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. The main storylines typically derived from the characters and their relationships to each other. Episode plots ranged from the simple, such as Winnie the Pooh searching for honey (stylized as hunny), to the more dramatic, such as Christopher Robin becoming trapped under his bed. Some episodes spoofed published works of fiction including &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Sherlock Holmes.

Episodes focused on socioemotional issues, dealing with topics such as teamwork, resourcefulness, how to triumph over challenges, the power of positive outlook, and the value of friendship. The series delivered strong messages about honesty, responsibility, persistence, cooperative effort, friendship and caring. The morals taught in each story allow children to draw parallels to their own lives. These were offered in a far more subtle manner than the &quot;prosocial snippets&quot; seen on other programs. Many stories are designed to help young children distinguish between fantasy and reality and overcome common childhood fears. Innumerable children&#x27;s-expert panels continued throughout its lengthy network run to highly commend and recommend the series to the three-to-ten-year-old crowd, even growing tolerant enough to be amused by the &quot;hunny/honey&quot; spelling controversy.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Charles Solomon of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the show &quot;the best made-for-TV cartoon show in several seasons&quot;. Months later, he claimed it as &quot;not only the classiest new show of the season, but also one of the best-looking series ever animated for television&quot;, and gave an similarly positive review the next year. &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; said it &quot;contained much more detailed and lively animation than the usual kidvid&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; said the show had &quot;theatrical-grade animation, sprightly stories, conscientious eschewing of laugh tracks and best of all, the willingness to let the visual jokes speak for themselves&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the show an &quot;A&quot; saying &quot;there&#x27;s enough excitement, including lots of slapstick and bad guys, to keep &#x27;90s adventurers happy&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the show &quot;lovingly faithful&quot; to the original Milne books. Lee Winfrey of &quot;Knight-Ridder&quot; says the writers successfully maintained the integrity of Milne&#x27;s characters and praised the animators for Ernest H. Shepard&#x27;s illustrations. The &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; said the show will &quot;offer children and probably their parents, a gentle walk through Pooh Corner&quot;. Gene Seymour of &quot;Knight-Ridder&quot; called the best animation on weekly television outside of the General Mills Commercials. &quot;The Dayton Daily News&quot; called the program one of the best on television writing &quot;The animation of this offering from the Disney&#x27;s studios is not as sumptuous as the company&#x27;s feature films, but it is miles above the television norm&quot;. Charles Witback praised the show claiming that &quot;Milne [came] out on top &quot; and they remain unique to the flashy, noisy Hollywood. &quot;The San Bernardino Sun&quot; wrote &quot;if kids like the verbal wit of the other shows, they&#x27;ll tackle the rich sophistication of Winnie the Pooh&quot;.

&quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; wrote that the show was &quot;sweet and endearing, though its educational value is essentially limited to a kid-tailored &#x27;I&#x27;m okay, you&#x27;re okay&#x27; theme&quot;. Common Sense Media gave the show 4 stars, saying &quot;the lessons are just as classic and time-tested as the characters&quot;. Hal Erickson, writing in his book &quot;Television Cartoon Shows&quot;, called the show a delightful eye of calm in &quot;the hurricane of hectic Saturday morning slapstick&quot;. DVDizzy.com praised the show calling it &quot;true both to the spirit of Milne&#x27;s creation and the animation of Disney&#x27;s terrific short films&quot;. DVDVerdict.com called the show &quot;perfectly respectable imitations that still rank as stellar, sweet-natured children&#x27;s entertainment&quot;, going on to write &quot;Kids should enjoy this stuff and adults should feel comfortable leaving their young ones in the care of this of this good-hearted programming for an hour&quot;. &quot;AnimatedViews&quot; called the show &quot;a well-remembered if not exceptional series that slotted into the kind of programming that filled the Disney Afternoons.&quot; David Perlmutter, in his book &quot;America Toons In&quot;, called the longevity of the show &quot;a testament to the enduring appeal of the beloved characters&quot;. Common Sense Media have the series a four out of five stars, saying, &quot;Classic characters will delight preschoolers.&quot;

Not all reviews have been positive. Evan Levine, writing for the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, gave the program a mixed review, saying &quot;the characters are all true to form, but the colors are overly bright, and the whole look is harsh&quot; but adding &quot;this series is certainly better than a lot of other cartoons that we&#x27;ve seen&quot;. Jan Crain Rudeen, writing for the Scripps Howard News Service, described the series and the resulting video releases as &quot;awful&quot;, which she felt lacked imagination. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the series as &quot;cheaply sweetened fare&quot;. One particular episode has been a source of controversy. &quot;Sorry Wrong Slusher&quot;, in which the characters stay up late, order pizza, and watch a late night &quot;slusher film&quot;, has been called violent.

===Ratings===
The network television premiere on Saturday, September 10, 1988, was hailed as an immediate success. The show won its time-slot with 5.9/23 Nielsen ratings share, translating to 5.7 million viewers. ABC, who had been in third place for Saturday morning the year prior, won every time-slot averaging a 5.0 rating/20 share. This trend continued for the next three weeks. Selby Hall, Marketing Manager for ABC, was quoted as saying &quot;[the show had] been very successful on Saturday mornings in the States&quot;. The high ratings caused an extra push behind the international airings of the program. Throughout the season, the show continued to receive &quot;solid&quot; ratings. The show ranked 10th place out of all Saturday morning cartoons for the season.

During the 1989–90 television schedule, the series was paired with &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;. The show once again won its time-slot, but fell one rating point from the previous year&#x27;s debut. The show repeated this the next week, but was beaten by &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; the next two weeks.

By 1993, the show had fallen in the ratings. Finishing 27th out of the 36 Saturday morning programs, the show averaged a 2.1/9 Nielsen rating share. The show received a 3.3 Nielsen rating in late February 1993 corresponding to 3.2 million viewers. In 1997, &quot;MediaWeek&quot; ranked it 301st out of every broadcast show. By the late 1990s, the show was one of the top five Saturday morning cartoons. It had a (2.5/11) market share in Boys 2–11 and a (2.2/11) market share in boys 6–11.

===Awards and nominations===
For its debut season, the show won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. During his acceptance speech, Mark Zaslove praised the actors and animators for their dedication to the series and specifically thanked Jymn Magon and Karl Geurs for the humanity they brought to the program. The following year the series was awarded the same honor, this time in a tie with &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. The show was awarded the first of two Humanitas Prizes during its first season for &quot;[examining] the need to both hold onto and let go of love&quot;. Three years later, the show would pick up its second prize for its dramatization &quot;of the struggle to assume responsibility and live with the consequences of your mistakes&quot;. The show also received a commemoration from the Action for Children&#x27;s Television with President Peggy Charren calling the show &quot;an imaginative extension of the Pooh stories...preserving the essence of the original characters&quot;.

The show was cited in the Children&#x27;s Television Act of 1990 as an example of a positive educational program. The show received a special salute during the opening session of the Congressional Club in 1988. Joan Lunden, co-host of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, hosted the opening session which included United States Congressional and Cabinet wives as well as their children and grandchildren. BuzzFeed ranked the theme song third in their list of &quot;7 Cartoon Theme Songs Guaranteed to Earworm You&quot;


==Home media==
Although Disney has never released the complete series on home video, there have been numerous video collections released over the years. The first was a collection of 10 videocassette tapes issued by Walt Disney Home Video. Each VHS contained two to four episodes, with the first three tapes released in 1989. This was followed by an additional two the next year, one more in 1991 and four more in 1992. Due to a twenty-five year license agreement on &quot;Pooh&quot; merchandise, these videotapes were released only in Sears. Sales were very poor, despite a solid consumer base.

Eric Schulz, Vice President of Marketing at Disney, recalled an incident one Friday afternoon at Kmart where parents were shopping: &quot;We noticed that no Winnie the Pooh characters were available. Several consumers were asking the store clerks if the Poohs were sold out&quot;. Schulz and his team discovered there were no plush toys available at Kmart, due to the licensing. They also discovered that this license was expiring in just a few months and would not be renewed. That afternoon, the marketing team returned to the office and began to plan new ideas to sell &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; videos.

In 1994, on the day that the Sears license expired, a nationwide Pooh video and plush promotion was launched. Videos were packaged with Pooh plush characters together in a single box. Disney proclaimed 1994, &quot;The Year of Pooh&quot;, which coincided with the 70th anniversary of Winnie the Pooh. In lieu of traditional press kit, Disney sent out a Winnie the Pooh cookie jar to the press outlets, a decision which received overwhelmingly positive reaction. &quot;The Today Show&quot; proudly displayed its Pooh cookie jar on television while the hosts talked about the new video releases.

Two collections of compilation tapes called &quot;Pooh Playtime&quot; and &quot;Pooh Learning&quot; were released with three videotapes encompassing each set. The videos featured between two and four episodes of &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; and featured new songs written by Dave Kinnoin. Sales were very high, with numerous videos turned up on the &quot;Video Bestseller List&quot;. In just three weeks, Disney had sold twenty times more &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; videos than they had in the previous twelve months. By 1995, Pooh videos sold over thirty times what they had sold the year before, despite the fact that Disney had only repackaged existing products. Because of their success, two additional videos were added to each collection. A third collection entitled &quot;Pooh Friendship&quot; was released in 1997, bringing the three collections to fifteen videos between them.

The show first appeared on DVD in the United Kingdom. Under the title &quot;The Magical World of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, eight volumes were released consisting of four episodes apiece. The first five volumes of this series later appeared in the United States under the name &quot;Growing Up with Winnie the Pooh&quot;. Appearing in February 2005, the releases were made to coincide with the premiere of &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Movie&quot;. These episodes did not include the original opening credits, but instead had new sequences specifically made for the discs. Episodes of the show have also been released as part of the &quot;special features&quot; in the DVD releases of Winnie the Pooh movies, such as &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo&quot;.

The series became available on Disney+ when the service launched on November 12, 2019.

==Legacy==
The series helped spawn a successful &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; media franchise, which grew into a series of made-for-TV holiday specials, two additional television series, and four theatrically released movies. Many of the cast members continued to work with these Winnie the Pooh adaptations. Jim Cummings continues to voice Winnie the Pooh and Tigger in the present day. Paul Winchell briefly reprised his role as Tigger in &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin&quot; as well as some of the 1990s Specials. John Fiedler voiced Piglet until his death in 2005. Peter Cullen continues to voice Eeyore. Ken Sansom continued voicing Rabbit until 2010. Much of the writers and directors returned for &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Grand Adventure&quot; and &quot;The Book of Pooh&quot;. Bruce Talkington has since written many children&#x27;s books based on Winnie the Pooh.

The show was one of the last times &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; was designed and marketed for audiences of all ages. In the years following the series, Walt Disney Home Video began to reposition their strategy and marketed the television series, and Winnie the Pooh in general, towards younger age groups, despite critics claiming the show can be enjoyed by members of all ages. In later years, the show has been touted as strictly for preschoolers. DVDizzy summarized the idea saying &quot;Even though Milne&#x27;s books had won over readers of all ages and even though kids weren&#x27;t buying movie tickets and merchandise, Disney seemed set on the idea that Pooh was strictly for little ones, those not even old enough to attend school&quot;.

The program caused a resurgence of popularity of &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; that continues to this day, to the point of the character being Disney&#x27;s second largest animated franchise, only behind Mickey Mouse &amp; Friends. Following the home video releases, Disney&#x27;s annual revenue from &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; rose from $100 million to more than $1 billion in just four years. Winnie the Pooh is now the most successful Disney character, surpassing Mickey Mouse. As of 2012, it is the third most popular media franchise in the United States.

To promote the opening of &quot;Winnie the Pooh: The New Musical Adaptation&quot;, the production released a recording of Corbin Bleu covering the show&#x27;s theme song. Bleu sings the original &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; theme for the actual production.

<text>The Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor (originally designated XP-91) is a mixed-propulsion prototype interceptor aircraft, developed by Republic Aviation. The aircraft would use a jet engine for most flight, and a cluster of four small rocket engines for added thrust during climb and interception. The design was largely obsolete by the time it was completed due to the rapidly increasing performance of contemporary jet engines, and only two prototypes were built. One of these was the first American fighter to exceed Mach 1 in level flight.

A unique feature of the Thunderceptor was its unusual inverse tapered wing, in which the chord length increased along the wing span from the root to the tip, the opposite of conventional swept wing designs. This was an attempt to address the problem of pitch-up, a potentially deadly phenomenon that plagued early high-speed models. The Thunderceptor&#x27;s design meant the entire wing stalled smoothly, more like a straight-wing design.

==Design and development==

During the development of the XP-84, Republic, under the guidance of Alexander Kartveli, looked at the installation of rockets to fighters. The company was inspired by German wartime aircraft: the rocket-powered Messerschmitt Me 163 and the experimental rocket-boosted turbojet Messerschmitt Me 262C &quot;Heimatschützer&quot; (home protector) series of interceptor prototypes.

The Thunderceptor design was one of two swept-wing modifications based on the original Republic F-84 Thunderjet, the other being the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak which was developed later. A serious problem with most swept wing designs of the era was dangerous performance at low speeds and high angle of attack. The stagnant airflow over the wing tended to &quot;slide&quot; towards the wingtips, which caused them to stall before the rest of the wing. In this situation the center of lift would rapidly shift forward relative to the center of mass, pitching the nose up and leading to an even greater angle of attack or, in extreme cases, end-over-end tumbling of the aircraft. Aircraft caught in this regime would often stall and crash, and a rash of such accidents with the North American F-100 Super Sabre led to the term &quot;Sabre dance&quot;.

The Thunderceptor&#x27;s most notable design feature was intended to address this problem. The wings were built to have considerably more chord (distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge) at the tip than root, allowing them to generate more lift. This neatly addressed the problem of Sabre dance by delaying the point of stall on the tip to that of the entire wing. A side-effect of this design was that the tips had more internal room, so the landing gear was mounted to retract outwards with the wheels lying in the wingtips, using two smaller wheels in a tandem arrangement for each main gear strut, instead of one larger one. Another design change was the ability to vary the angle of incidence of the wing as a whole, tilting it up for low speed operations during takeoff and landing, and then &quot;leveling it off&quot; for high-speed flight and cruise. This allowed the fuselage to remain closer to level while landing, greatly improving visibility.

In keeping with its intended role as an interceptor, the nose was redesigned to incorporate a radar antenna, forcing the air intake for the engine to be moved from its original nose-mounted position to a new intake below it. The fuselage was otherwise very similar to the F-84&#x27;s. The first prototype did not include the radome, although this was fitted to the second prototype.

==Testing and evaluation==

The first prototype made its first flight on 9 May 1949, breaking the speed of sound in December 1951. It was later modified with a small radome for gunnery ranging (although not the &quot;full&quot; radome of the second prototype). The second prototype included a full radome and chin-mounted intake, but was otherwise similar. With both the jet and rockets running, the aircraft could reach Mach 1.71. Both prototypes completed 192 test flights over the course of five years.

The second prototype, &quot;46-681&quot;, had an engine failure during takeoff from Edwards AFB in the summer of 1951. Republic test pilot Carl Bellinger escaped from the aircraft just as the tail melted off only 90 seconds into the flight. By the time fire apparatus arrived, driving across the dry lake bed, the tail section had been reduced to ashes. 46-681 was then fitted with a &quot;V&quot; (or &quot;butterfly&quot;) tail, and was flight-tested with this configuration. It was later used at Edwards AFB as a crash-crew training simulator, then scrapped.

As an interceptor the Thunderceptor was soon eclipsed by designs from other companies, but like the Thunderceptor none of these would go into production. The United States Air Force decided to wait the short time needed to introduce newer and much more capable designs created as a part of the 1954 interceptor project. The Thunderceptor, like the other interceptor designs of the era, had extremely short flight times on the order of 25 minutes, making them almost useless for protecting an area as large as the United States. The 1954 designs outperformed the XF-91 in speed, range, and loiter time, as well as including the radar and fire-control systems needed for night and all-weather operation. The era of the dedicated day fighter-type interceptor was over.

==Aircraft on display==

The surviving prototype, 46–0680, is exhibited in the Research &amp; Development Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio.

<text>A CAPTCHA ( ) is a type of challenge–response test used in computing to determine whether the user is human in order to deter bot attacks and spam.

The term was coined in 2003 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford. It is a contrived acronym for &quot;Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.&quot; A historically common type of CAPTCHA (displayed as reCAPTCHA v1) was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel. This form of CAPTCHA requires entering a sequence of letters or numbers from a distorted image. Because the test is administered by a computer, in contrast to the standard Turing test that is administered by a human, CAPTCHAs are sometimes described as reverse Turing tests.

Two widely used CAPTCHA services are Google&#x27;s reCAPTCHA and the independent hCaptcha. It takes the average person approximately 10 seconds to solve a typical CAPTCHA.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of CAPTCHAs is to prevent spam on websites, such as promotion spam, registration spam, and data scraping. Many websites use CAPTCHA effectively to prevent bot raiding. CAPTCHAs are designed so that humans can complete them, while most robots cannot. Newer CAPTCHAs look at the user&#x27;s behaviour on the internet, to prove that they are a human. A normal CAPTCHA test only appears if the user acts like a bot, such as when they request webpages, or click links too fast.

== History ==
Since the 1980s–1990s, users have wanted to make text illegible to computers. The first such people were hackers, posting about sensitive topics to Internet forums they thought were being automatically monitored on keywords. To circumvent such filters, they replaced a word with look-alike characters. &quot;HELLO&quot; could become or , and others, such that a filter could not detect &quot;all&quot; of them. This later became known as leetspeak.

One of the earliest commercial uses of CAPTCHAs was in the Gausebeck–Levchin test. In 2000, idrive.com began to protect its signup page with a CAPTCHA and prepared to file a patent. In 2001, PayPal used such tests as part of a fraud prevention strategy in which they asked humans to &quot;retype distorted text that programs have difficulty recognizing.&quot; PayPal co founder and CTO Max Levchin helped commercialize this use.

A popular deployment of CAPTCHA technology, reCAPTCHA, was acquired by Google in 2009. In addition to preventing bot fraud for its users, Google used reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA technology to digitize the archives of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and books from Google Books in 2011.

== Characteristics ==
CAPTCHAs are automated, requiring little human maintenance or intervention to administer, producing benefits in cost and reliability.

Modern text-based CAPTCHAs are designed such that they require the simultaneous use of three separate abilities—invariant recognition, segmentation, and parsing to complete the task.

* Invariant recognition refers to the ability to recognize letters despite a large amount of variation in their shapes.
* Segmentation is the ability to separate one letter from another, made difficult in CAPTCHAs.
* Parsing refers to the ability to understand the CAPTCHA holistically, in order to correctly identify each character.

Each of these problems poses a significant challenge for a computer, even in isolation. Therefore, these three techniques in tandem make CAPTCHAs difficult for computers to solve.

Whilst primarily used for security reasons, CAPTCHAs can also serve as a benchmark task for artificial intelligence technologies. According to an article by Ahn, Blum and Langford, &quot;any program that passes the tests generated by a CAPTCHA can be used to solve a hard unsolved AI problem.&quot; They argue that the advantages of using hard AI problems as a means for security are twofold. Either the problem goes unsolved and there remains a reliable method for distinguishing humans from computers, or the problem is solved and a difficult AI problem is resolved along with it.

== Accessibility ==

CAPTCHAs based on reading text—or other visual-perception tasks—prevent blind or visually impaired users from accessing the protected resource. Because CAPTCHAs are designed to be unreadable by machines, common assistive technology tools such as screen readers cannot interpret them. The use of CAPTCHA thus excludes a small percentage of users from using significant subsets of such common Web-based services as PayPal, Gmail, Orkut, Yahoo!, many forum and weblog systems, etc. In certain jurisdictions, site owners could become targets of litigation if they are using CAPTCHAs that discriminate against certain people with disabilities. For example, a CAPTCHA may make a site incompatible with Section 508 in the United States.

CAPTCHAs do not have to be visual. Any hard artificial intelligence problem, such as speech recognition, can be used as CAPTCHA. Some implementations of CAPTCHAs permit users to opt for an audio CAPTCHA, such as reCAPTCHA, though a 2011 paper demonstrated a technique for defeating the popular schemes at the time.

A method of improving CAPTCHA to ease the work with it was proposed by ProtectWebForm and named &quot;Smart CAPTCHA&quot;. Developers are advised to combine CAPTCHA with JavaScript. Since it is hard for most bots to parse and execute JavaScript, a combinatory method which fills the CAPTCHA fields and hides both the image and the field from human eyes was proposed.

One alternative method involves displaying to the user a simple mathematical equation and requiring the user to enter the solution as verification. Although these are much easier to defeat using software, they are suitable for scenarios where graphical imagery is not appropriate, and they provide a much higher level of accessibility for blind users than the image-based CAPTCHAs. These are sometimes referred to as MAPTCHAs (M = &quot;mathematical&quot;). However, these may be difficult for users with a cognitive disorder, such as dyscalculia.

Challenges such as a logic puzzle, or trivia question can also be used as a CAPTCHA. There is research into their resistance against countermeasures.

== Circumvention ==
Two main ways to bypass CAPTCHA include using cheap human labor to recognize them, and using machine learning to build an automated solver. According to former Google &quot;click fraud czar&quot; Shuman Ghosemajumder, there are numerous services which solve CAPTCHAs automatically.

=== Machine learning–based attacks ===

There was not a systematic methodology for designing or evaluating early CAPTCHAs. As a result, there were many instances in which CAPTCHAs were of a fixed length and therefore automated tasks could be constructed to successfully make educated guesses about where segmentation should take place. Other early CAPTCHAs contained limited sets of words, which made the test much easier to game. Still others made the mistake of relying too heavily on background confusion in the image. In each case, algorithms were created that were successfully able to complete the task by exploiting these design flaws. However, light changes to the CAPTCHA could thwart them. Modern CAPTCHAs like reCAPTCHA rely on present variations of characters that are collapsed together, making them hard to segment, and they have warded off automated tasks.

In October 2013, artificial intelligence company Vicarious claimed that it had developed a generic CAPTCHA-solving algorithm that was able to solve modern CAPTCHAs with character recognition rates of up to 90%. However, Luis von Ahn, a pioneer of early CAPTCHA and founder of reCAPTCHA, said: &quot;It&#x27;s hard for me to be impressed since I see these every few months.&quot; 50 similar claims to that of Vicarious had been made since 2003.

In August 2014 at Usenix WoOT conference, Bursztein et al. presented the first generic CAPTCHA-solving algorithm based on reinforcement learning and demonstrated its efficiency against many popular CAPTCHA schemas.

In October 2018 at ACM CCS&#x27;18 conference, Ye et al. presented a deep learning-based attack that could consistently solve all 11 text captcha schemes used by the top-50 popular websites in 2018. An effective CAPTCHA solver can be trained using as few as 500 real CAPTCHAs.

=== Human labor ===
It is possible to subvert CAPTCHAs by relaying them to a sweatshop of human operators who are employed to decode CAPTCHAs. A 2005 paper from a W3C working group said that they could verify hundreds per hour. In 2010, the University of California at San Diego conducted a large scale study of CAPTCHA farms. The retail price for solving one million CAPTCHAs was as low as $1,000.

Another technique consists of using a script to re-post the target site&#x27;s CAPTCHA as a CAPTCHA to the attacker&#x27;s site, which unsuspecting humans visit and solve within a short while for the script to use.

In 2023, ChatGPT tricked a TaskRabbit worker into solving a CAPTCHA by telling the worker it was not a robot and had impaired vision.

=== Outsourcing to paid services ===
There are multiple Internet companies like &quot;2Captcha&quot; and &quot;DeathByCaptcha&quot; that offer human and machine backed CAPTCHA solving services for as low as US$0.50 per 1000 solved CAPTCHAs. These services offer APIs and libraries that enable users to integrate CAPTCHA circumvention into the tools that CAPTCHAs were designed to block in the first place.

=== Insecure implementation ===
Howard Yeend has identified two implementation issues with poorly designed CAPTCHA systems: reusing the session ID of a known CAPTCHA image, and CAPTCHAs residing on shared servers.

Sometimes, if part of the software generating the CAPTCHA is client-side (the validation is done on a server but the text that the user is required to identify is rendered on the client side), then users can modify the client to display the un-rendered text. Some CAPTCHA systems use MD5 hashes stored client-side, which may leave the CAPTCHA vulnerable to a brute-force attack.

== Alternative CAPTCHAs ==
Some researchers have proposed alternatives including image recognition CAPTCHAs which require users to identify simple objects in the images presented. The argument in favor of these schemes is that tasks like object recognition are more complex to perform than text recognition and therefore should be more resilient to machine learning based attacks.

Chew et al. published their work in the 7th International Information Security Conference, ISC&#x27;04, proposing three different versions of image recognition CAPTCHAs, and validating the proposal with user studies. It is suggested that one of the versions, the anomaly CAPTCHA, is best with 100% of human users being able to pass an anomaly CAPTCHA with at least 90% probability in 42 seconds. Datta et al. published their paper in the ACM Multimedia &#x27;05 Conference, named IMAGINATION (IMAge Generation for INternet AuthenticaTION), proposing a systematic way to image recognition CAPTCHAs. Images are distorted so image recognition approaches cannot recognise them.

Microsoft (Jeremy Elson, John R. Douceur, Jon Howell, and Jared Saul) claim to have developed Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access (ASIRRA) which ask users to distinguish cats from dogs. Microsoft had a beta version of this for websites to use. They claim &quot;Asirra is easy for users; it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Anecdotally, users seemed to find the experience of using Asirra much more enjoyable than a text-based CAPTCHA.&quot; This solution was described in a 2007 paper to Proceedings of 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). It was closed in October 2014.

<doc id="230835" wikidata="Q89670998" url="?curid=230835" title="Uneven bars">
<text>The uneven bars or asymmetric bars is an artistic gymnastics apparatus. It is made of a steel frame. The bars are made of fiberglass with wood coating, or less commonly wood. The English abbreviation for the event in gymnastics scoring is UB or AB, and the apparatus and event are often referred to simply as &quot;bars&quot;. The bars are placed at different heights and widths, allowing the gymnast to transition from bar to bar. A gymnast usually adds white chalk to the hands so that they can grip the bar better.

== The apparatus ==
Uneven bars used in international gymnastics competitions must conform to the guidelines and specifications set forth by the International Gymnastics Federation Apparatus Norms brochure. Several companies manufacture and sell bars, including AAI in the United States, Jannsen and Fritsen in Europe, and Acromat in Australia.

Many gyms also have a single bar or a set of uneven bars over a loose foam pit or soft mat to provide an additional level of safety when learning new skills.

=== Dimensions ===
Measurements depend on the setting of the bar. Measurements of the bars are provided by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) in the &quot;Apparatus Norms&quot; brochure.

* Height:
** High bars: 
** Low bar: 
* Diameter of bar: 
* Length of the bars: 
* Diagonal distance between the two bars: varies, – (adjustable)

== Routines ==
Routines usually involve a lot of strength, jumping, and swings. They are generally composed of a set of skills, each worth a particular value.

=== Evolution ===
The uneven bars apparatus originally consisted of men&#x27;s parallel bars set to different heights. Consequently, the bars were very close together, and gymnasts could transition from one to the other with little difficulty. Routines of the early 1950s chiefly consisted of simple circles, kips, and static balance elements and holds. In the late 1950s, the trend shifted toward fluid motion, and gymnasts began to perform routines composed of more difficult circles, kips, beats (bouncing the body off the low bar while hanging from the high bar), wraps (wrapping the body around the low bar while hanging from the high bar) and transitions. Release moves also began to come into play, although they were almost entirely limited to transitions between the low and high bars.
In the late 1960s/early 1970s, companies began manufacturing uneven bars as a separate specific apparatus. The design was changed slightly to allow the bars to be adjustable, with tension cables that held the apparatus to the floor. As a result of this change, coaches could set the bars farther apart. Additionally, the bars&#x27; circumference decreased, allowing gymnasts to grasp and swing from them with greater ease.

As other events in gymnastics increased in difficulty, so did the uneven bars. Gymnasts and coaches began experimenting with elements, attempting more challenging dismounts, and adapting moves from men&#x27;s horizontal bar. In 1972, Olga Korbut pioneered the Korbut Flip, the first high bar salto release move. Nadia Comăneci continued the trend with her original Comaneci salto at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal and advanced handstand elements four years later. The giant swing, the staple of high bar in men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics (MAG), was also adopted into the women&#x27;s &quot;Code of Points&quot;, and quickly became a basic uneven bars skill.

By the mid-1980s, routines had become so based on swing and release moves that the bars were moved even farther apart. The distance between bars increased even more as gymnasts developed complex transition elements that required space, such as the Pak salto.

For international elite-level gymnasts, there is a required distance between the low and high bar, called the FIG setting, where all elite-level gymnasts must compete.

Of all the apparatus in women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics (WAG), uneven bars are probably the ones that have seen the most radical changes. Most elements from the 1950s and &#x27;60s bars routines, such as the Hecht dismount and the Radochla somersault, are now entirely obsolete and rarely used; others, such as the once-traditional beats and wraps, are impossible given the current diagonal separation between bars, and still others, such as static holds and the Korbut Flip, are not permitted under the current &quot;Code of Points.&quot;
In USAG levels 1–5, everyone in the same level performs the same compulsory routine. In levels 1-3, the gymnasts stay only on the low bar. Once the gymnast reaches level 4, she uses both the low and high bars. In levels 6 through elite, gymnasts and coaches make up their own routines within specific requirements using both bars.

In Gymnastics Australia, gymnasts in levels 1-6 set routines that are scored out of 10. In levels 7-10 and elite, gymnasts perform optional routines that adhere to set guidelines and meet certain requirements.

=== International level routines ===
A routine on the uneven bars must consist of:
*Flight element from high bar to low bar and vice versa
*Flight element on the same bar
*At least two different grips and a close bar circle element
*Non-flight with a turn on the bar, for example, turning handstands
*Dismount

=== Scoring and rules ===
Judges score routines based on difficulty, form, technique, and composition. Deductions are taken for execution errors, poor form, falls, pauses, &quot;empty&quot; swings (extra swings that do not lead into another skill), steps on the dismount, and other mistakes. Falls incur an automatic deduction of 1 full point in the 2009 FIG CoP. For levels 1-10, a fall is 0.5 points. Also, if the gymnast hits the low bar with her foot/feet (as Beth Tweddle did at the 2008 Olympics bars qualifications, and Viktoria Komova did at the 2012 Olympics bars apparatus finals), a deduction of 0.1 to 0.5 points will occur depending on the severity of the hit. The same deduction occurs when the gymnast hits one or both feet on the floor while performing a skill on the low bar.

==== Apparatus specific rules ====

Gymnasts are permitted to tape their hands or use grips or hand guards on bars level 4 through elite. Their coaches are also permitted to apply chalk and/or water to the bars to ensure gymnasts don&#x27;t slip off.

Unlike high bar and rings in MAG, gymnasts may not be lifted to the uneven bars to begin their routines. They may mount the apparatus with either a simple or a difficult skill on either the high or low bar; running mounts and springboards are permitted.

Once the routine has started, the coach may not physically interfere with the athlete. The coach can stand on the mat during release moves and dismounts. If the gymnast falls on one of these skills, her coach can catch her or break her fall; the coach can also lift her back to the high bar to continue her routine. If a springboard has been used for the mount, the coach is supposed to quickly step in and remove it so that it does not interfere with the routine.

If a gymnast falls from the apparatus, she has 30 seconds to re-mount. Within this time limit, she can readjust her grips or chalk her hands again if necessary. However, her routine will be finished if she does not return to the bars within 30 seconds. Many judges are flexible with this rule, especially if the gymnast took a hard fall and needed a minute to shake it off and regain her focus. Often, the judge or judging assistant will give the gymnast a ten-second warning.

==Olympic champions at the uneven bars==


== Injuries ==
A study of competitive collegiate gymnastics injuries found that almost as many injuries occurred on uneven bars as on the floor. Falls from the bars can lead to serious injuries or paralysis; Taylor Lindsay-Noel was paralyzed during an attempted dismount from the apparatus in 2008. On rare occasions, accidents have been fatal. In 2021, Séverine Emeraude Djala Abaka, a Cameroonian gymnast, died shortly before the African Championships, where she had intended to compete, after falling on her neck.

<text>Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol is a 1983 American animated Christmas fantasy featurette directed and produced by Burny Mattinson. The cartoon is an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and stars Scrooge McDuck as Ebenezer Scrooge. Many other Disney characters, primarily from the Mickey Mouse universe, as well as Jiminy Cricket from &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940), and characters from &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot; (1949) and &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973), were cast throughout the film. The featurette was produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution on December 16, 1983, with the re-issue of &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977). In the United States, it was first aired on television on NBC, on December 10, 1984.

&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; was largely adapted from the 1974 Disneyland Records audio musical &quot;An Adaptation of Dickens&#x27; Christmas Carol&quot;. The musical featured similar dialogue and a similar cast of characters. Additionally this film was the last time that Clarence Nash voiced Donald Duck before his death in 1985.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1984, but lost to Jimmy Picker&#x27;s &quot;Sundae in New York&quot;. It was the first nomination for a Mickey Mouse short since &quot;Mickey and the Seal&quot; (1948).

==Plot==

On Christmas Eve, Ebenezer Scrooge (Scrooge McDuck), a greedy and lonely moneylender of Victorian era London, resents the merriment of Christmas; he refuses to give money to a panhandler outside his counting house, declines his nephew Fred&#x27;s (Donald Duck) invitation to Christmas dinner, and dismisses two gentlemen (Rat and Mole) fundraising aid for the poor. His overworked and underpaid employee, Bob Cratchit (Mickey Mouse), requests to have half of Christmas Day off; Scrooge reluctantly accepts on the condition that Cratchit is docked half a day&#x27;s pay. That night, he is visited by the shackled ghost of his late business partner Jacob Marley (Goofy). Marley warns that three spirits will visit Scrooge during the night, and that he will be similarly burdened after death if he does not change his wicked ways.

At one o&#x27;clock, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Jiminy Cricket), who shows him visions of his time as an employee under Fezzywig (Mr. Toad). At Fezziwig&#x27;s Christmas party, the young Scrooge was in love with Isabelle (Daisy Duck). Later, Isabelle asks if Scrooge has decided to marry her. Scrooge declines and forecloses the mortgage on her honeymoon cottage. Realizing that he loves money more than her, Isabelle leaves him forever. A distraught Scrooge begs the Ghost to return him home.

Scrooge next meets the gigantic, merry Ghost of Christmas Present (Willie the Giant), who takes Scrooge to Bob Cratchit&#x27;s house. Scrooge sees that their Christmas dinner for their family of five consists of barely enough food to feed one person, and becomes especially concerned when he sees Cratchit&#x27;s ill son Tiny Tim (Morty Mouse). The Ghost hints that if things continue the way they are, Tim will soon die.

The Ghost leaves him with the Ghost of Christmas Future (Pete), who takes Scrooge into the future to see the Cratchit family mourning Tiny Tim at the cemetery. As Scrooge asks the spirit if the events can still be changed, they see two gravediggers (Weasels) remarking how no one came to mourn the man they are burying. After they leave, the Ghost reveals the tombstone bears Scrooge&#x27;s name, and shoves Scrooge down into the grave while dubbing him &quot;the richest man in the cemetery.&quot; Falling into his own coffin which opens to show the flames of Hell, Scrooge vows to change his ways before finding himself in his bedroom on Christmas Day.

Filled with glee, Scrooge begins spreading happiness and joy around London, donating a sizable amount of money to the gentlemen&#x27;s charity and reconciling with Fred. Traveling to the Cratchit house, Scrooge resumes his curmudgeonly persona by saying he expects more of Cratchit, then surprises everyone with gifts of a prize turkey, toys, and giving Cratchit a substantial raise along with making him his business partner, as Tiny Tim declares &quot;God bless us, everyone.&quot;

==Production==
This was the first original Mickey Mouse theatrical cartoon produced in over 30 years. With the exception of re-releases, Mickey had not appeared in movie theaters since the short film &quot;The Simple Things&quot; (1953). The graveyard sequence was also the first time Disney tested the animation photo transfer process. Many additional characters seen in the film had also not appeared in a theatrical cartoon for several decades such as Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow. The film was also one of the final times Clarence Nash voiced Donald Duck before his death in 1985. Nash was the only original voice actor in the film as Walt Disney (Mickey Mouse) had died in 1966, Pinto Colvig (Goofy) in 1967, Bill Thompson (Scrooge McDuck), Cliff Edwards (Jiminy Cricket) and Billy Gilbert (Willie the Giant) in 1971, and Billy Bletcher (Pete and the Big Bad Wolf) in 1979. It also marked the first time in animation that Scrooge McDuck was voiced by actor Alan Young (who had first voiced the character on the musical album); Young would continue to be the primary voice actor for McDuck, most notably in &quot;DuckTales&quot;, until the actor&#x27;s death in 2016.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8/10 based on 8 reviews.

Film critic Leonard Maltin said that rather than being &quot;a pale attempt to imitate the past&quot;, the film is &quot;cleverly written, well-staged, and animated with real spirit and a sense of fun&quot;. Robin Allan stated that the film calls to mind the similarities between Walt Disney and Charles Dickens, in terms of both the work they produced and their work ethic.

However, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert of &quot;At the Movies&quot; gave it &quot;two thumbs down&quot; as they were both disappointed. Siskel felt there was not enough emphasis on Mickey&#x27;s character, in spite of the title, and that it did not rank with most of Disney&#x27;s full-length animated features. Ebert stated that it lacked the magic of visual animation that the &quot;Disney people are famous for&quot; and that it was a &quot;forced march&quot; through the Charles Dickens story without any ironic spin.

&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Animated Short Subject of 1983, losing to Jimmy Picker&#x27;s &quot;Sundae in New York&quot;.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and wrote that &quot;it is surprising how entertaining this is, perhaps because it is actually a Scrooge McDuck movie (of course), with the effete rodent very much in a minor role as Bob Cratchit&quot;.

In 2019, Robert Keeling of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; noted as it &quot;not exactly a faithful retelling – surprisingly, the issue of Scrooge’s mother and sister dying never comes up – but it’s a thoroughly enjoyable and warm festive offering nonetheless&quot;.

==Releases==

&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; premiered in the UK on October 20, 1983, alongside a re-issue of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), and was released in the US on December 16 of the same year, with a Christmas 1983 re-issue of &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977). It has been broadcast on various television stations throughout the years. It started on NBC (1984–1990) with 12 new additional sepia title cards illustrated by Michael Peraza Jr. to match the 12 he had done for the original film to help bridge the segments together. It went on to air on The Disney Channel (1987–1999; 2002–2006), and CBS (1991–1998), occasionally on ABC (2000; 2003) before moving permanently to ABC Family (2001–). It was aired on Toon Disney in 2008. The run on ABC Family includes &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too&quot; and was part of their &quot;25 Days of Christmas&quot;, but with several abrupt edits including the &quot;Chocolate Pot Roast with Yogurt&quot; line and Marley tripping on the stairs and falling down, letting out a Goofy holler. In Canada, it airs on CBC, and has been aired every Christmas season since 1985. It typically airs the Sunday before Christmas. For many years, the short film would air on CBC as a one-hour program, as mentioned below. In addition, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; would be shown unmatted. In recent years, however, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; is only aired in a half-hour time slot and in high definition matted widescreen, presumably to be more suited for modern television screens.

The aforementioned broadcasts in the 1980s and early 1990s spanned a full hour, with the first half consisting of the following older cartoon shorts: &quot;Donald&#x27;s Snow Fight&quot;, &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Christmas Tree&quot;, and &quot;The Art of Skiing&quot;. Each of the four items in the program was preceded by a narrative wraparound segment in which one of the Disney cartoon characters (Donald, Pluto (with Mickey translating), Goofy, and Mickey, respectively) would talk about his favorite Christmas, thus leading into the cartoon in question. From 1988 onwards, &quot;The Art of Skiing&quot; was excluded from the annual broadcast, replaced at the end of the hour by one segment or another. The 1993 telecast, for example, featured a behind-the-scenes featurette on &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. Later broadcasts simply reduced the timeslot to half an hour, showing &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; by itself.

A clip of this film in Swedish was shown on &quot;Donald Duck&#x27;s 50th Birthday&quot; to illustrate Donald&#x27;s international appeal.

This short film was featured in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse&quot;. The shot of Mickey holding Tiny Tim&#x27;s crutch is also seen in the opening of &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;.

==Home media==
The short was released several times on VHS and LaserDisc throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was released in the Mini-Classics line on September 28, 1989, September 25, 1990 and October 7, 1994. It was re-issued in the Favorite Stories line on October 2, 1996. Some releases featured &quot;The Making of &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;&quot; as a bonus.

The short is also featured, without its opening credits, in the direct-to-home release, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot;. It is also available on the ninth volume of the &quot;Walt Disney Classic Cartoon Favorites&quot; DVD collection, as well as in the &quot;Walt Disney Treasures&quot; set &quot;Mickey Mouse in Living Color – Volume 2&quot;; the latter is the only DVD to be released in its theatrical 1.66:1 widescreen aspect ratio, but it is simply cropping the 1.33:1 version. The short is also on the &quot;Disney Animation Collection&quot; Volume 7 DVD (1.33:1). On November 5, 2013, the 30th Anniversary Edition of this short was released on DVD and for the first time on Blu-ray, but it was further cropped to 1.78:1 widescreen and featured a heavy use of noise reduction. Various other shorts were included in the DVD.

<text>Fatal Microbes were an English punk rock band formed in 1978. The main line-up of the band consisted of Honey Bane on vocals, Gem Stone on drums, Pete Fender on guitar and Scotty Barker on bass.

The band&#x27;s name is regarded as a reference to the theme of disgust and toxicity, explored and embraced by many punk rock acts in the late 1970s and early 1980.

==History==
In 1979 Small Wonder and XNTRIX Records co-released a split 12-inch EP entitled &quot;Violence Grows&quot;, which also featured the Epping-based Poison Girls (whose singer, Vi Subversa, was also mother to Gem Stone and Pete Fender). In the same year Fatal Microbes released a 7-inch single featuring &quot;Violence Grows&quot; on the punk rock record label Small Wonder Records. The single was championed by British DJ and radio presenter John Peel.

Honey Bane later had a career as a solo artist, a film and stage actress and a model. Pete Fender subsequently went on to form Rubella Ballet with Gem Stone (bass) and Sid Ation (drums). Fender later released a 7-inch EP, &quot;Four Formulas&quot;, under his own name on XNTRIX records. Fender and ‘It’ had formed the band Punktuation in 1977. With an average age of 13 years, they were amongst the youngest punk bands in the country at the time.
Scott Barker went on to become a founding member of the legendary &#x27;Old Reenies&#x27; (sometimes spelt &#x27;Ol Rene&#x27;s&#x27;) with former Sods front man Kevin Jones and former No Warning guitarist Martin Brown. Scott Barker now lives in Spain and continues to perform.

The band&#x27;s songs were included in the compilation album for &quot;Rip It Up and Start Again&quot; compilation released in 2006 through V2 Records.
