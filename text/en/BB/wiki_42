<text>Surface-mount technology (SMT), originally called planar mounting, is a method in which the electrical components are mounted directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB). An electrical component mounted in this manner is referred to as a surface-mount device (SMD). In industry, this approach has largely replaced through-hole technology construction method of fitting components, in large part because SMT allows for increased manufacturing automation which reduces cost and improves quality. It also allows for more components to fit on a given area of substrate. Both technologies can be used on the same board, with the through-hole technology often used for components not suitable for surface mounting such as large transformers and heat-sinked power semiconductors.

An SMT component is usually smaller than its through-hole counterpart because it has either smaller leads or no leads at all. It may have short pins or leads of various styles, flat contacts, a matrix of solder balls (BGAs), or terminations on the body of the component.

== History ==

Surface-mount technology was developed in the 1960s. By 1986, surface-mounted components accounted for 10% of the market at most but were rapidly gaining popularity. By the late 1990s, the great majority of high-tech electronic printed circuit assemblies were dominated by surface mount devices. Much of the pioneering work in this technology was done by IBM. The design approach first demonstrated by IBM in 1960 in a small-scale computer was later applied in the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer used in the Instrument Unit that guided all Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles. Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be directly soldered to the surface of the PCB. Components became much smaller, and component placement on both sides of a board became far more common with surface mounting than through-hole mounting, allowing much higher circuit densities and smaller circuit boards and, in turn, machines or subassemblies containing the boards.

Often, the surface tension of the solder is enough to hold the parts to the board; in rare cases, parts on the bottom or &quot;second&quot; side of the board may be secured with adhesive to keep components from dropping off inside reflow ovens. Adhesive is sometimes used to hold SMT components on the bottom side of a board if a wave soldering process is used to solder both SMT and through-hole components simultaneously. Alternatively, SMT and through-hole components can be soldered on the same side of a board without adhesive if the SMT parts are first reflow-soldered, then a selective solder mask is used to prevent the solder holding those parts in place from reflowing and the parts floating away during wave soldering. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor cost and greatly increasing production rates.

Conversely, SMT does not lend itself well to manual or low-automation fabrication, which is more economical and faster for one-off prototyping and small-scale production; this is one reason why many through-hole components are still manufactured. Some SMDs can be soldered with a temperature-controlled manual soldering iron, but those that are very small or have too fine a lead pitch are often almost impossible to manually solder without expensive equipment.

== Common abbreviations ==
Different terms describe the components, technique, and machines used in manufacturing. These terms are listed in the following table:


== Assembly techniques ==

Where components are to be placed, the printed circuit board normally has flat, usually tin-lead, silver, or gold plated copper pads without holes, called &quot;solder pads&quot;. Solder paste, a sticky mixture of flux and tiny solder particles, is first applied to all the solder pads with a stainless steel or nickel stencil using a screen printing process. It can also be applied by a jet-printing mechanism, similar to an inkjet printer. After pasting, the boards proceed to the pick-and-place machines, where they are placed on a conveyor belt. The components to be placed on the boards are usually delivered to the production line in either paper/plastic tapes wound on reels or plastic tubes. Some large integrated circuits are delivered in static-free trays. Numerical control pick-and-place machines remove the parts from the tapes, tubes or trays and place them on the PCB.

The boards are then conveyed into the reflow soldering oven. They first enter a pre-heat zone, where the temperature of the board and all the components is gradually, uniformly raised to prevent thermal shock. The boards then enter a zone where the temperature is high enough to melt the solder particles in the solder paste, bonding the component leads to the pads on the circuit board. The surface tension of the molten solder helps keep the components in place. If the solder pad geometries are correctly designed, surface tension automatically aligns the components on their pads.

There are a number of &quot;techniques&quot; for reflowing solder. One is to use infrared lamps; this is called infrared reflow. Another is to use a hot gas convection. Another technology that is becoming popular again is special fluorocarbon liquids with high boiling points which use a method called vapor phase reflow. Due to environmental concerns, this method was falling out of favor until lead-free legislation was introduced which requires tighter controls on soldering. At the end of 2008, convection soldering was the most popular reflow technology using either standard air or nitrogen gas. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. With infrared reflow, the board designer must lay the board out so that short components do not fall into the shadows of tall components. Component location is less restricted if the designer knows that vapor phase reflow or convection soldering will be used in production. Following reflow soldering, certain irregular or heat-sensitive components may be installed and soldered by hand, or in large-scale automation, by focused infrared beam (FIB) or localized convection equipment.

If the circuit board is double-sided then this printing, placement, reflow process may be repeated using either solder paste or glue to hold the components in place. If a wave soldering process is used, then the parts must be glued to the board before processing to prevent them from floating off when the solder paste holding them in place is melted.

After soldering, the boards may be washed to remove flux residues and any stray solder balls that could short out closely spaced component leads. Rosin flux is removed with fluorocarbon solvents, high flash point hydrocarbon solvents, or low flash solvents e.g. limonene (derived from orange peels) which require extra rinsing or drying cycles. Water-soluble fluxes are removed with deionized water and detergent, followed by an air blast to quickly remove residual water. However, most electronic assemblies are made using a &quot;No-Clean&quot; process where the flux residues are designed to be left on the circuit board, since they are considered harmless. This saves the cost of cleaning, speeds up the manufacturing process, and reduces waste. However, it is generally suggested to wash the assembly, even when a &quot;No-Clean&quot; process is used, when the application uses very high frequency clock signals (in excess of 1 GHz). Another reason to remove no-clean residues is to improve adhesion of conformal coatings and underfill materials. Regardless of whether cleaning or not those PCBs, the current industry trend suggests carefully reviewing a PCB assembly process where &quot;No-Clean&quot; is applied, since flux residues trapped under components and RF shields may affect surface insulation resistance (SIR), especially on high component density boards.

Certain manufacturing standards, such as those written by the IPC – Association Connecting Electronics Industries require cleaning regardless of the solder flux type used to ensure a thoroughly clean board. Proper cleaning removes all traces of solder flux, as well as dirt and other contaminants that may be invisible to the naked eye. No-Clean or other soldering processes may leave &quot;white residues&quot; that, according to IPC, are acceptable &quot;provided that these residues have been qualified and documented as benign&quot;. However, while shops conforming to IPC standards are expected to adhere to the Association&#x27;s rules on board condition, not all manufacturing facilities apply IPC standards, nor are they required to do so. Additionally, in some applications, such as low-end electronics, such stringent manufacturing methods are excessive both in expense and time required.

Finally, the boards are visually inspected for missing or misaligned components and solder bridging. If needed, they are sent to a rework station where a human operator repairs any errors. They are then usually sent to the testing stations (in-circuit testing and/or functional testing) to verify that they operate correctly.

Automated optical inspection (AOI) systems are commonly used in PCB manufacturing. This technology has proven highly efficient for process improvements and quality achievements.

== Advantages ==

The main advantages of SMT over the through-hole technique are:
* Faster-automated assembly. Some placement machines are capable of placing more than 136,000 components per hour.
* Much higher component density (components per unit area) and many more connections per component.
* Components can be placed on both sides of the circuit board.
* Higher density of connections because holes do not block routing space on inner layers, nor on back-side layers if components are mounted on only one side of the PCB.
* Small errors in component placement are corrected automatically as the surface tension of molten solder pulls components into alignment with solder pads. (On the other hand, through-hole components cannot be slightly misaligned because once the leads are through the holes, the components are fully aligned and cannot move laterally out of alignment.)
* Better mechanical performance under shock and vibration conditions (partly due to lower mass and partly due to less cantilevering)
* Lower resistance and inductance at the connection; consequently, fewer unwanted RF signal effects and better and more predictable high-frequency performance.
* Better EMC performance (lower radiated emissions) due to the smaller radiation loop area (because of the smaller package) and the lesser lead inductance.
* Fewer holes need to be drilled. (Drilling PCBs is time-consuming and expensive.)
* Lower initial cost and time of setting up for mass production using automated equipment.
* Many SMT parts cost less than equivalent through-hole parts.
* Smaller components.

== Disadvantages ==

* SMT may be unsuitable as the sole attachment method for components subject to frequent mechanical stress, such as connectors used to interface with external devices that are frequently attached and detached.
* SMDs&#x27; solder connections may be damaged by potting compounds going through thermal cycling.
* Manual prototype assembly or component-level repair is more difficult and requires skilled operators and more expensive tools, due to the small sizes and lead spacings of many SMDs. Handling of small SMT components can be difficult, requiring tweezers, unlike nearly all through-hole components. Whereas through-hole components will stay in place (under gravitational force) once inserted and can be mechanically secured prior to soldering by bending out two leads on the solder side of the board, SMDs are easily moved out of place by a touch of a soldering iron. Without developed skill, when manually soldering or desoldering a component, it is easy to accidentally reflow the solder of an adjacent SMT component and unintentionally displace it, something that is almost impossible to do with through-hole components.
* Many types of SMT component packages cannot be installed in sockets, which provide for easy installation or exchange of components to modify a circuit and easy replacement of failed components. (Virtually all through-hole components can be socketed.)
* SMDs cannot be used directly with plug-in breadboards (a quick snap-and-play prototyping tool), requiring either a custom PCB for every prototype or the mounting of the SMD upon a pin-leaded carrier. For prototyping around a specific SMD component, a less-expensive breakout board may be used. Additionally, stripboard style protoboards can be used, some of which include pads for standard-sized SMD components. For prototyping, &quot;dead bug&quot; breadboarding can be used.
* Solder joint dimensions in SMT quickly become much smaller as advances are made toward ultra-fine pitch technology. The reliability of solder joints becomes more of a concern as less and less solder is allowed for each joint. Voiding is a fault commonly associated with solder joints, especially when reflowing a solder paste in the SMT application. The presence of voids can deteriorate the joint strength and eventually lead to joint failure.
* SMDs, usually being smaller than equivalent through-hole components, have less surface area for marking, requiring marked part ID codes or component values to be more cryptic and smaller, often requiring magnification to be read, whereas a larger through-hole component could be read and identified by the unaided eye. This is a disadvantage for prototyping, repair, rework, reverse engineering, and possibly for production set-up.

== Rework ==

Defective surface-mount components can be repaired by using soldering irons (for some connections) or a non-contact rework system. In most cases, a rework system is the better choice because SMD work with a soldering iron requires considerable skill and is not always feasible.

Reworking usually corrects some type of error, either human- or machine-generated, and includes the following steps:

* Melt solder and remove component(s)
* Remove residual solder (may be not required for some components)
* Print solder paste on PCB, directly or by dispensing or dipping
* Place new component and reflow.

Sometimes hundreds or thousands of the same part need to be repaired. If due to assembly, such errors are often caught during the process. However, a whole new level of rework arises when component failure is discovered too late, and perhaps unnoticed until the end user of the device being manufactured experiences it. Rework can also be used if products of sufficient value to justify it require revision or re-engineering, perhaps to change a single firmware-based component. Reworking in large volumes requires an operation designed for that purpose.

There are essentially two non-contact soldering/desoldering methods: infrared soldering and soldering with hot gas.

===Infrared===
With infrared soldering, the energy for heating up the solder joint is transmitted by long-, medium- or short-wave infrared electromagnetic radiation.

Advantages:

* Easy setup
* No compressed air required for the heating process (some systems use compressed air for cooling)
* No requirement for different nozzles for many component shapes and sizes, reducing cost and the need to change nozzles
* Very uniform heating possible, assuming high-quality IR heating systems
* Gentle reflow process with low surface temperatures, assuming correct profile settings
* Fast reaction of infrared source (depends on the system used)
* Closed loop temperature control directly on the component is possible by applying a thermocouple or pyrometric measurement. This allows compensation for varying environmental influences and temperature losses. Enables use of the same temperature profile on slightly different assemblies, as the heating process adapts itself automatically. Enables (re)entry into the profile even on hot assemblies
* Direct setting of target profile temperatures and gradients possible through direct control of component temperature in each individual soldering process.
* No increased oxidation due to strong blowing of the solder joints with hot air, reduces flux wear or flux blowing away
* Documentation of the temperature elapsed on the component for each individual rework process possible

Disadvantages:

* Temperature-sensitive nearby components must be shielded from heat to prevent damage, which requires additional time for every board
* On short wavelength IR only: Surface temperature depends on the component&#x27;s albedo: dark surfaces will be heated more than lighter surfaces
* Convective loss of energy at the component possible
* No reflow atmosphere possible (but also not required)

===Hot gas===
During hot gas soldering, the energy for heating up the solder joint is transmitted by a hot gas. This can be air or inert gas (nitrogen).

Advantages:

* Some systems allow switching between hot air and nitrogen
* Standard and component-specific nozzles allow high reliability and faster processing
* Allow reproducible soldering profiles (depending on the system used)
* Efficient heating, large amounts of heat can be transferred
* Even heating of the affected board area (depends on system/nozzle quality used)
* Temperature of the component will never exceed the adjusted gas temperature
* Rapid cooling after reflow, resulting in small-grained solder joints (depending on the system used)

Disadvantages:

* Thermal capacity of the heat generator results in a slow reaction whereby thermal profiles can be distorted (depending on the system used)
* Precise, sometimes very complex, component-specific hot gas nozzles are needed to direct the hot gas to the target component. These can be very expensive.
* Today, nozzles can often no longer be deposited on the PCB by neighboring components, which means there is no longer a closed process chamber and adjacent components can be blown on strongly from the side. This can lead to the blowing of adjacent components and even to thermal damage. In this case, adjacent components must be protected from airflow, e.g. by covering them with polyimide tape.
* Local turbulence of the hot gas can create hot and cold spots on the heated surfaces, resulting in uneven heating. Therefore, perfectly designed, high-quality nozzles are a must!
* Swirls at component edges, especially at bases and connectors, can heat these edges significantly more than other surfaces. Overheating can occur (burns, melting of plastics)
* Losses due to environmental influences are not compensated for since the component temperature is not measured in the production process
* Creation of a suitable reflow profile requires an adjustment and test phase, in some cases involving several stages
* Direct temperature control of the component is not possible because measuring the actual component temperature is difficult due to the high gas velocity (measurement failure!)

===Hybrid technology===

Hybrid rework systems combine medium-wave infrared radiation with hot air

Advantages:

* Easy setup
* The low flow velocity hot air supporting the IR radiation improves heat transfer but cannot blow away components
* Heat transfer does not depend entirely on the flow velocity of hot gas at the component/assembly surface (see hot gas)
* No requirement for different nozzles for many component shapes and sizes, reducing cost and the need to change nozzles
* Adjustment of the heating surface is possible through various attachments if required
* Heating even very large/long and exotically shaped components possible, depending on the type of top heater
* Very uniform heating possible, assuming high-quality hybrid heating systems
* Gentle reflow process with low surface temperatures, assuming correct profile settings
* No compressed air is required for the heating process (some systems use compressed air for cooling)
* Closed loop temperature control directly on the component is possible by applying a thermocouple or pyrometric measurement. This allows compensation for varying environmental influences and temperature losses. Enables use of the same temperature profile on slightly different assemblies, as the heating process adapts itself automatically. Enables (re)entry into the profile even on hot assemblies
* Direct setting of target profile temperatures and gradients possible through direct control of component temperature in each individual soldering process.
* No increased oxidation due to strong blowing of the solder joints with hot air, reduces flux wear or flux blowing away
* Documentation of the temperature elapsed on the component for each individual rework process possible

Disadvantages

* Temperature-sensitive nearby components must be shielded from heat to prevent damage, which requires additional time for every board. Shield must also cover from gas flow
* Convective loss of energy at the component possible

== Packages ==

Surface-mount components are usually smaller than their counterparts with leads, and are designed to be handled by machines rather than by humans. The electronics industry has standardized package shapes and sizes (the leading standardisation body is JEDEC).

The smallest case sizes available after 0201 are 01005, 008005, 008004, 008003 and 006003.

== Identification ==

; Resistors: For 5% precision SMD resistors usually are marked with their resistance values using three digits: two significant digits and a multiplier digit. These are quite often white lettering on a black background, but other colored backgrounds and lettering can be used. For 1% precision SMD resistors, the code is used, as three digits would otherwise not convey enough information. This code consists of two digits and a letter: the digits denote the value&#x27;s position in the E96 Series of values, while the letter indicates the multiplier.
; Capacitors: Non-electrolytic capacitors are usually unmarked and the only reliable method of determining their value is removal from the circuit and subsequent measurement with a capacitance meter or impedance bridge. The materials used to fabricate the capacitors, such as nickel tantalate, possess different colours and these can give an approximate idea of the capacitance of the component. Generally physical size is proportional to capacitance and (squared) voltage for the same dielectric. For example, a 100 nF, 50 V capacitor may come in the same package as a 10 nF, 150 V device. SMD (non-electrolytic) capacitors, which are usually monolithic ceramic capacitors, exhibit the same body color on all four faces not covered by the end caps. SMD electrolytic capacitors, usually tantalum capacitors, and film capacitors are marked like resistors, with two significant figures and a multiplier in units of picofarads or pF, (10−12 farad.)
; Inductors: Smaller inductance with moderately high current ratings are usually of the ferrite bead type. They are simply a metal conductor looped through a ferrite bead and almost the same as their through-hole versions but possess SMD end caps rather than leads. They appear dark grey and are magnetic, unlike capacitors with a similar dark grey appearance. These ferrite bead type are limited to small values in the nanohenry (nH) range and are often used as power supply rail decouplers or in high frequency parts of a circuit. Larger inductors and transformers may of course be through-hole mounted on the same board. SMT inductors with larger inductance values often have turns of wire or flat strap around the body or embedded in clear epoxy, allowing the wire or strap to be seen. Sometimes a ferrite core is present also. These higher inductance types are often limited to small current ratings, although some of the flat strap types can handle a few amps. As with capacitors, component values and identifiers for smaller inductors are not usually marked on the component itself; if not documented or printed on the PCB, measurement, usually removed from the circuit, is the only way of determining them. Larger inductors, especially wire-wound types in larger footprints, usually have the value printed on the top. For example, &quot;330&quot;, which equates to a value of 33μH.
; Discrete semiconductors: Discrete semiconductors, such as diodes and transistors are often marked with a two- or three-symbol code. The same code marked on different packages or on devices from different manufacturers can translate to different devices. Many of these codes, used because the devices are too small to be marked with more traditional numbers used on larger packages, correlate to more familiar traditional part numbers when a correlation list is consulted. GM4PMK in the United Kingdom has prepared a correlation list, and a similar .pdf list is also available, although these lists are not complete.
; Integrated circuits: Generally, integrated circuit packages are large enough to be imprinted with the complete part number which includes the manufacturer&#x27;s specific prefix, or a significant segment of the part number and the manufacturer&#x27;s name or logo.

<text>Bryan Kei Mantia (born February 4, 1963), known professionally as Brain, is an American rock drummer. He has played with bands such as Primus, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Praxis, and Godflesh, and with other performers such as Tom Waits, Serj Tankian, Bill Laswell, Bootsy Collins, and Buckethead. He has also done session work for numerous artists and bands.

== History ==
Mantia was born February 4, 1963, in the South Bay city of Cupertino, California, to an Italian American father and a Japanese American mother. As a teenager, Mantia became interested in such artists as James Brown, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix, acts that featured groove-heavy sounds. When he was 16 years old, he started playing drums. Because of his &#x27;obsessive&#x27; study of the drum book &quot;Portraits in Rhythm&quot; by Anthony J. Cirone, Mantia was given the nickname &quot;Brain&quot; by members of his high school concert band.

Mantia attended the Percussion Institute of Technology in Hollywood, California, during the mid-1980s to further hone his craft. During this time, he was a member of local funk-rock band named the Limbomaniacs (which would later become part of Ben Wa). In 1989, Mantia joined Primus briefly, before breaking his foot, forcing him to pull out of the band.

In the early 1990s, he joined Praxis, a musical project led by Bill Laswell and initially featuring Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins and Buckethead. The drummer was a mainstay of Praxis for the 1990s, featuring on most of their albums. Mantia recorded with Buckethead on many of Buckethead&#x27;s solo albums, including &quot;Monsters and Robots&quot;, &quot;Colma&quot;, &quot;The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell&quot;, and &quot;Bucketheadland 2&quot;, among others.

Sometime in 1995, Mantia was approached by his cousin Kristin Yee, who was managing industrial metal band Godflesh, to join the band as their drummer. He accepted the offer and performed on their 1996 album &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot; as well as &quot;Love and Hate in Dub&quot;. However, Mantia was unable to commit his time in Europe and left the band the same year. Some time later, Mantia rejoined Primus, touring with (and recording for) four years with the group, appearing on &quot;Brown Album&quot;, &quot;Rhinoplasty&quot; and &quot;Antipop&quot;.

In March 2000, Mantia joined the revamped lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses after being recommended to singer Axl Rose by Buckethead (who himself had joined the band a few months earlier).

In 2003, Mantia appeared on several songs on BT&#x27;s 2003 release &quot;Emotional Technology&quot; as well as BT&#x27;s score for the 2003 film &quot;Monster&quot;.

Mantia toured several legs of the Chinese Democracy Tour with Guns N&#x27; Roses from 2000 until 2006, when he left the band to take care of his newborn child. Frank Ferrer, originally brought in as just a replacement drummer for the tour, eventually replaced Mantia as full time drummer for the band. &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was released in 2008, and featured drums from Mantia on every track except the title track. Mantia was also credited with writing the songs &quot;Shackler&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Sorry&quot;. Parts of Mantia&#x27;s drumming on the album were note-for-note re-recordings of Josh Freese&#x27;s parts, who left the band before Mantia joined. Mantia was also responsible for arrangements on &quot;Shackler&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Better&quot;, &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, &quot;There Was a Time&quot;, &quot;Sorry&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, and &quot;Prostitute&quot;, initial production on &quot;Shackler&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Sorry&quot;, engineering on &quot;Sorry&quot;, drum machine and drum programming on &quot;I.R.S.&quot; and Logic Pro engineering for the entire album.

After leaving the band, Mantia made a guest appearance (alongside fellow former GNR member Robin Finck) at Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; House of Blues West Hollywood show on March 12, 2012. Mantia played congas on &quot;You&#x27;re Crazy&quot; and &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;. He continued to occasionally work for the band on yet to be released remix material.

Since leaving Guns N&#x27; Roses, Mantia has primarily been focused on music behind the scenes as a composer and producer.

Mantia had a brief stint drumming with The Crystal Method in 2013 and 2014 (alongside Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Richard Fortus). These performances included appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live, and Last Call with Carson Daly 

In 2017, Mantia toured with Buckethead and Dan Monti as part of Buckethead&#x27;s live show.

Mantia performed with Primus for the first time in 24 years at the Fox Oakland Theatre on December 30, 2024. However, with Les Claypool and Larry LaLonde auditioning for &quot;the greatest drummer on Earth&quot; in Primus, Mantia did not officially rejoin the band.

== Composing ==
Mantia has partnered with musician Melissa Reese on several projects, a composing team dubbed &quot;Brain and Melissa&quot;. In 2010, along with Buckethead, they released the multi-CD sets &quot;Kind Regards&quot; and &quot;Best Regards&quot;. Brain and Melissa composed part of the soundtrack to the video game &quot;Infamous 2&quot;, for which they were nominated for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Original Composition&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences awards. Other video games the duo worked on include, &quot;Midnight Club 2&quot; , &quot;PlayStation Home&quot;, &quot;ModNation Racers&quot;, &quot;Twisted Metal&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (received the nomination &quot;Original Dramatic Score, Franchise&quot; at the 2014 NAVGTR Awards, shared with Marc Canham and Nathan Johnson). They also scored the films &quot;Detention&quot; and &quot;Power/Rangers&quot;. They have worked with music video director Joseph Kahn on several television commercials, including NASCAR, SEAT, and Qoros. In addition, they scored a commercial for Johnnie Walker Blue which featured a computer-generated Bruce Lee. They also worked on several remixes of songs off of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; for a planned remix album.

The two created a stock music album called &quot;Eclectic Cinema&quot; alongside former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Paul Tobias, and Guns N&#x27; Roses and Buckethead collaborator Pete Scaturro. Mantia has also worked with Tobias on several other stock music tracks.

The duo performed at the halftime show of a Houston Rockets basketball game on November 10, 2017, performing remixes of &quot;Sorry&quot; and &quot;If the World&quot; from &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, and a cover of KISS&#x27;s &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; from Destroyer.

<text>North Woodmere is an unincorporated hamlet in the Town of Hempstead, New York, located in far western Nassau County on the South Shore of Long Island in the Town of Hempstead.

== History ==
Prior to its development in the late 1950s, the land stretching from Lawrence to South Valley Stream was owned by attorney Franklin B. Lord (President of the Long Island Water Company in the late nineteenth century). The water company pumping station also occupied some of this property and is there to this day. His estate, known as &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Woods&quot;  went through Cedarhurst and Lawrence, all the way to Far Rockaway. At Mill Road, the woods thinned out and there was farmland. The last vestige of these woods remains today at the Long Island Water Property.

In 1956, as the housing boom transformed Nassau County&#x27;s landscape, this last remaining area of natural woodland in southwest Nassau was the subject of a dispute between conservation groups, residents, and developers. Woodmere Woods, over 100 acres of woodland bordered by Peninsula Boulevard and Mill Road, was originally part of the Long Island Water Corporation&#x27;s property.  The Peninsula Shopping Center is now situated where Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts had camping weekends.

By the late 1950s, technology had developed to dig deeper wells, and despite conservationists protesting, the Long Island Water Corp. opted to sell off a vast swath of their property for development. By the end of 1958, the woods were completely gone, and the newly developed area christened &quot;North Woodmere Knolls&quot;.

In 1962, voters approved the County of Nassau purchasing approximately of land and approximately of water for the development of North Woodmere County Park.

While officially South Valley Stream (North Woodmere is served by the Valley Stream Post Office), the developers came up with a marketing ploy to associate their tract homes with the more upscale Five Towns. North Woodmere became part of Hewlett-Woodmere School District 14, and is unofficially considered part of The Five Towns due to their cultural and social relationships.

== Geography ==
North Woodmere is directly north of Woodmere, but separated from it by Motts Creek. Access to Woodmere is available via Branch Boulevard, Brookfield Road, and a footbridge over the creek. Unlike Woodmere, North Woodmere is not part of the Five Towns, which consists of the villages of Lawrence and Cedarhurst, the hamlets of Hewlett, Inwood and Woodmere.

Hungry Harbor Road is the main east–west route through North Woodmere, connecting with Branch Boulevard (to Cedarhurst) and Brookfield-Rosedale Road (to Valley Stream). Park Lane provides access to upper Rosedale Road, and from there to Francis Lewis Boulevard, Sunrise Highway, and the Belt Parkway and Cross Island Parkway junction.

== Economy ==
A shopping mall is located on Rosedale Road. A former shopping center on Hungry Harbor Road became an assisted living center.

The community is home to North Woodmere Park, a Nassau County park. The park includes a pool complex, a playground, a nine-hole golf course, a lighted driving range, and a fishing area.

== Demographics ==

North Woodmere houses many residents with advanced degrees and higher educational attainment. Many residents attend four year colleges and professional schools thereafter. There is an educational culture throughout the town.

== Government ==
North Woodmere is represented on the Town of Hempstead Council by Melissa Miller

== Culture ==
North Woodmere is home to several synagogues, including Congregation Ohr Torah, Young Israel of North Woodmere, Beis Haknesses of North Woodmere, Temple Hillel, Kodesh, Kehillas Bnei Hayeshivos, Khal Lev Avos, Khal Chasidim and Chabad of Valley Stream. In 1984, Ronald Reagan addressed Temple Hillel.

== Education ==
This area is served by two school districts: 15 (Lawrence Public Schools) in the west, 14 (Hewlett-Woodmere School District) in the center.

==Notable residents==
* Bruce Blakeman, first presiding officer of Nassau County.
* David M. Friedman (born 1958), U.S. ambassador to Israel

<doc id="232343" wikidata="Q334732" url="?curid=232343" title="Hong Xiuquan">
<text>Hong Xiuquan (1 January 1814 – 1 June 1864), born Hong Huoxiu and with the courtesy name Renkun, was a Chinese revolutionary and religious leader who led the Taiping Rebellion against the Qing dynasty. He established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom over large portions of southern China, with himself as its &quot;Heavenly King&quot;.

Born into a Hakka family in Guangzhou, Hong claimed to have experienced mystical visions after failing the imperial examinations. He came to believe that his celestial father he saw in the visions was God the Father, his celestial elder brother was Jesus Christ, and he had been directed to rid the world of demon worship. He rejected Confucianism and began propagating a fusion of Christianity, Daoism and millenarianism, which Hong presented as a restoration of the ancient Chinese faith in Shangdi. His associate Feng Yunshan then founded the God Worshipping Society to spread Hong&#x27;s teachings. By 1850, Hong&#x27;s sect had over 10,000 followers and increasingly came into conflict with Qing authorities.

In January 1851, Hong organized a rebel army and routed the Qing forces at Jintian, marking the beginning of the Taiping Rebellion. He then declared himself the Heavenly King of the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace. Taiping rebels captured the city of Nanjing in March 1853 and declared it the Heavenly Capital of the kingdom, after which Hong withdrew to his new palace and began ruling through proclamations. He became increasingly suspicious of Yang Xiuqing, his fellow Taiping leader, and engineered Yang&#x27;s murder in a 1856 purge that spiraled into the further purge of more Taiping leaders. The kingdom gradually lost ground and in June 1864, in the face of Qing advance, Hong died following a period of illness and was succeeded by his son, Hong Tianguifu. Nanjing fell a month later.

==Early life and education==
Hong Xiuquan, born &quot;Hong Huoxiu&quot;, was the third and youngest son of a Hakka family living in the village of Fuyuan Springs (also referred to as Fuyuanshui village), Hua county (now part of Huadu District) in Guangzhou. His father was Hong Jingyang, a farmer and elected headman and his mother was surnamed Wang. No less than nine different dates are given for Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s birth: Jian Youwen established based on documentary evidence that Hong was born on 1 January 1814. This date is accepted by most scholars, including noted Chinese historian Luo Ergang. Some sources claim his family was &quot;well to do&quot;. He and his family moved to Guanlubu Village shortly after his birth. Upon marrying his wife Lai Xiying, Hong received the courtesy name &quot;Renkun.&quot; His sister, Hong Xuanjiao, became the commander of the female battalion during the Taiping Rebellion.

Hong showed an interest in scholarship at an early age, so his family made financial sacrifices to provide a formal education for him, in the hope that he could one day complete all of the civil service examinations. Hong began studying at a primary school in his village at the age of five. He was able to recite the Four Books after five or six years. He then took the local entry-level civil service examinations and placed first. A few years later, he traveled to the provincial capital of Guangzhou to take the provincial examinations. He was unsuccessful and, his parents being unable to afford to continue his education, he was forced to return to agricultural work. The next year, he accompanied a wealthy schoolmate elsewhere for a year of study and became a village schoolteacher upon his return.

In 1836, at the age of 22, Hong returned to Guangzhou to retake the imperial examinations. While in Guangzhou, Hong heard Edwin Stevens, a foreign missionary, and his interpreter preaching about Christianity. From them, Hong received a set of pamphlets entitled &quot;Good Words for Exhorting the Age&quot;, which were written by Liang Fa, Stevens&#x27;s assistant, and contained excerpts from the Bible along with homilies and other material prepared by Liang. Supposedly, Hong only briefly looked over these pamphlets and did not pay much attention to them at the time. Unsurprisingly, he again failed the imperial examinations, which had a pass rate of less than one percent.

==Visions and iconoclasm==
In 1837, Hong attempted and failed the imperial examinations for a third time, leading to a nervous breakdown. He was delirious for days to the point that his family feared for his life. While convalescing, Hong dreamed of visiting Heaven, where he discovered that he possessed a celestial family distinct from his earthly family, which included a heavenly father, mother, elder brother, sister-in-law, wife, and son. His heavenly father, wearing a black dragon robe and high-brimmed hat with a long golden beard, lamented that men were worshiping demons rather than he himself, and presented Hong with a sword and golden seal with which to slay the demons infesting Heaven. Furthermore, he did so with the help of his celestial older-brother and a heavenly army. The father figure later informed Hong that his given name violated taboos and had to be changed, suggesting as one option the &quot;Hong Xiuquan&quot; moniker ultimately adopted by Hong. In later embellishments, Hong would declare that he also saw Confucius being punished by Hong&#x27;s celestial father for leading the people astray. His acquaintances would later claim that after awakening from his dreams Hong became more careful, friendly, and open, while his pace became imposing and firm and his height and size increased. Hong stopped studying for the imperial examinations and sought work as a teacher. For the next several years Hong taught at several schools around the area of his hometown.

In 1843, Hong failed the imperial examinations for the fourth and final time. It was only then, prompted by a visit by his cousin, that Hong took time to carefully examine the Christian pamphlets he had received. After reading these pamphlets, Hong came to believe that they had given him the key to interpreting his visions: his celestial father was God the Father (whom he identified with Shangdi from Chinese tradition), the elder brother that he had seen was Jesus Christ, and he had been directed to rid the world of demon worship. This interpretation led him to conclude that he was the literal son of God and younger brother to Jesus. In contrast to some of the later leaders of his movement, Hong appears to have genuinely believed in his ascent to Heaven and divine mission. After coming to this conclusion Hong began destroying idols and enthusiastically preaching his interpretation of Christianity. As a symbolic gesture to purge China of Confucianism, he and the cousin asked for two giant swords, three &quot;chi&quot; () long and nine &quot;jin&quot; (about 4.5 kg), called the &quot;demon-slaying swords&quot; (), to be forged.

Hong began by burning all Confucian and Buddhist statues and books in his house, and began preaching to his community about his visions. Some of his earliest converts were relatives of his who had also failed their examinations and belonged to the Hakka minority, Feng Yunshan and Hong Rengan. He collaborated with them to destroy holy statues in small villages, to the ire of local citizens and officials. Hong and his converts&#x27; acts were considered sacrilegious and they were persecuted by Confucians who forced them to leave their positions as village tutors. In April 1844, Hong, Feng Yunshan, and two other relatives of Hong left Hua county to travel and preach. They first journeyed to Guangzhou and preached in the outlying areas before heading northwest to White Tiger Village. There, Hong and Feng Yunshan parted ways before traveling some to the southwest to the village of Sigu, Guiping county, Guangxi, where distant relatives of Hong&#x27;s resided, including two early converts who had returned home. It is in or near Sigu that Hong begins to draft &quot;Exhortations to Worship the One True God&quot;, his first substantial work. In November 1844, after having preached in Guangxi for five months, Hong returned home without Feng and resumed his previous job as a village teacher, while continuing to write religious tracts.

==The &quot;God Worshippers&quot;==
In 1847, Hong Xiuquan was invited by a member of the Chinese Union to study with the American Southern Baptist missionary Reverend Issachar Jacox Roberts. Hong accepted the invitation and traveled to Guangzhou with his cousin, Hong Rengan. Once there, Hong studied Karl Gützlaff&#x27;s translations of the Old and New Testaments, converted to Protestantism and requested to be baptized by Roberts. Roberts refused to do so, possibly due to Hong being tricked by the other converts into requesting monetary aid from Roberts. Hong left Guangzhou on 12 July 1847 to search for Feng Yunshan. Although robbed of all of his possessions, including his demon-slaying sword, by bandits in the town of Meizixun, he eventually reached Thistle Mountain on 27 August 1847. There, he reunited with Feng and discovered the &quot;Society of God-Worshippers&quot; that Feng had founded.

In January 1848, Feng Yunshan was arrested and banished to Guangdong, and Hong Xiuquan left for Guangdong shortly thereafter to once again reunite with Feng. In Feng and Hong&#x27;s absence, Yang Xiuqing and Xiao Chaogui jointly emerged to lead the &quot;God Worshipers&quot; themselves. Both claimed to enter trances which allowed them to speak as a member of the Trinity; God the Father in the case of Yang and Jesus Christ in the case of Xiao. When Hong and Feng returned in the summer of 1849, they investigated Yang and Xiao&#x27;s claims and declared them to be genuine. Hong ministered to the faithful in outdoor meetings strongly resembling the Baptist tent revivals he had witnessed with Issachar Roberts.

Most of Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s knowledge of the scriptures came from the books known as &quot;Good Words to Admonish the Age&quot; written by the Chinese preacher Liang Fa, as well as a localized Bible translated into Chinese. Many Western missionaries grew jealous of Hong and his local ministry. These competing missionaries were fond of spreading defamatory rumors such as his &quot;lack of baptism.&quot; (Hong and his cousin were in fact both baptized according to the way prescribed in the pamphlet &quot;Good words to admonish the age&quot;).

In 1847, Hong began his translation and adaptation of the Bible, what came to be known as &quot;Authorized Taiping Version of the Bible&quot;, or &quot;The Taiping Bible&quot;, which he based on Gutzlaff&#x27;s translation. He presented his followers with the Bible as a vision of the authentic religion that had existed in ancient China before it was wiped out by Confucius and the imperial system. The deity of the Old Testament punished evil nations and rewarded those who followed his commandments, even music, food, and marriage laws.

Hong made some minor changes in the text, such as correcting misprints and improving the prose style, but adapted the meaning elsewhere to fit his own theology and moral teachings. For instance, in Genesis 27:25 the Israelites did not drink wine, and in Genesis 38:16–26 he omitted the sexual relations between the father and his son&#x27;s widow. Hong preached a mixture of communal utopianism, evangelism and oriental syncretism. While proclaiming sexual equality, the sect segregated men from women and encouraged all its followers to pay their assets into a communal treasury.

When Hong returned to Guangxi, he found that Feng Yunshan had accumulated a following of around 2,000 converts. Guangxi was a dangerous area at this time with many bandit groups based in the mountains and pirates on the rivers. Perhaps due to these more pressing concerns, the authorities were largely tolerant of Hong and his followers. However, the instability of the region meant that Hong&#x27;s followers were inevitably drawn into conflict with other groups, not least because of their predominantly Hakka ethnicity. There are records of numerous incidents when local villages and clans, as well as groups of pirates and bandits, came into conflict with the authorities, and responded by fleeing to join Hong&#x27;s movement. The rising tension between the sect and the authorities was probably the most important factor in Hong&#x27;s eventual decision to rebel.

==Rebellion and the Heavenly Kingdom==
By 1850, Hong had between 10,000 and 30,000 followers. The authorities were alarmed at the growing size of the sect, and ordered them to disperse. A local force was sent to attack them when they refused, but the imperial troops were routed and a deputy magistrate killed. A full-scale attack was launched by government forces in the first month of 1851, in what came to be known as the Jintian Uprising, named after the town of Jintian (which became Guiping, Guangxi) where the sect was based. Hong&#x27;s followers emerged victorious and beheaded the Manchu commander of the government army. Hong declared the founding of the &quot;Heavenly Kingdom of Transcendent Peace&quot; on 11 January 1851.
Despite this evidence of planning, Hong and his followers faced immediate challenges. The local Green Standard Army outnumbered them ten to one, and had recruited the help of the river pirates to keep the rebellion contained to Jintian. After a month of preparation the rebels managed to break through the blockade and fight their way to the town of Yongan (distinct from places named Yong&#x27;an), which fell to them on 25 September 1851.

Hong and his troops remained in Yongan for three months, sustained by local landowners who were hostile to the Manchu-ruled Qing dynasty. The imperial army regrouped and launched another attack on the rebels in Yongan. Having run out of gunpowder, Hong&#x27;s followers fought their way out by sword, and made for the city of Guilin, to which they laid siege. However, the fortifications of Guilin proved too strong, and Hong and his followers eventually gave up and set out northwards, towards Hunan. Here, they encountered an elite militia created by a local member of the gentry specifically to put down peasant rebellions. The two forces fought at Soyi Ford on 10 June 1852; the rebels were forced into retreat, and 20% of their troops were killed. However, in March 1853, Hong&#x27;s forces managed to take Nanjing and turned it into the capital of their movement.

After establishing his capital at Nanjing, Hong implemented an ambitious reform and modernization program. He created an elaborate civil bureaucracy, reformed the calendar used in his kingdom, outlawed opium use, and introduced a number of reforms designed to make women more socially equal to men. Hong ruled by making frequent proclamations from his Heavenly Palace, demanding strict compliance with various moral and religious rules. Most trade was suppressed, and some communal land ownership was introduced. Polygamy was forbidden and men and women were separated, although Hong and other leaders maintained groups of concubines.

Yang Xiuqing, also known as the &quot;Eastern King&quot;, was a fellow Taiping leader who had directed successful military campaigns, and who often claimed to speak with the voice of God. Hong became increasingly suspicious of Yang&#x27;s ambitions and his network of spies. In 1856, he and others in the Taiping élite had Yang and his family murdered in a purge that subsequently spun out of control, resulting in the further purge of its main perpetrator Wei Changhui.

Following a failed attempt by the Taiping rebels to take Shanghai in 1860, Qing government forces, aided by Western officers, slowly gained ground.

==Death==
In the spring of 1864, Tianjing was besieged and dangerously low on food supplies. Hong&#x27;s solution was to order his subjects to eat manna, which had been translated into Chinese as sweetened dew and a medicinal herb. Hong himself gathered weeds from the grounds of his palace, which he then ate. Hong fell ill in April 1864, possibly due to his ingestion of the weeds, and died on 1 June 1864. Although Hong likely died of his illness, suicide by poison has also been suggested. He was buried in a yellow-silk shroud without a coffin according to Taiping custom, near the former Ming Imperial Palace. He was succeeded by his teenage son, Hong Tianguifu.

On 30 July 1864, Qing forces exhumed, beheaded, and cremated Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s body. Zeng Guofan (one of the prominent Qing generals) had ordered this done to verify Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s death. The ashes were blasted out of a cannon to ensure that his remains had no resting place, as an eternal punishment for the uprising.

==Legacy==

Views and opinions on Hong differ greatly. The Communists under Mao Zedong generally admired Hong and his rebellion as a legitimate peasant uprising that anticipated their own. Sun Yat-sen came from the same area as Hong and was said to have identified with Hong since his childhood days.

To honor his legacy, the People&#x27;s Republic of China established a small museum in 1959, the &quot;Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s Former Residence Memorial Museum&quot; (), in his birthplace, where there is a longan tree planted by him. The museum&#x27;s plate is written by the famous literary figure Guo Moruo (1892–1978). The residence and Book Chamber Building were renovated in 1961.

There has been an active academic debate on the degree to which Hong is similar or dissimilar to Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi. Scholars that promote the opinion that a strong similarity exists between Li and Hong note that both rallied a large number of people behind a religious or spiritual cause in order to challenge the &quot;status quo&quot;. Scholars disputing a close relationship note that Li&#x27;s political intentions are debatable.

<text>Butyric acid (; from , meaning &quot;butter&quot;), also known under the systematic name butanoic acid, is a straight-chain alkyl carboxylic acid with the chemical formula . It is an oily, colorless liquid with an unpleasant odor. Isobutyric acid (2-methylpropanoic acid) is an isomer. Salts and esters of butyric acid are known as butyrates or butanoates. The acid does not occur widely in nature, but its esters are widespread. It is a common industrial chemical and an important component in the mammalian gut.

==History==
Butyric acid was first observed in an impure form in 1814 by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. By 1818, he had purified it sufficiently to characterize it. However, Chevreul did not publish his early research on butyric acid; instead, he deposited his findings in manuscript form with the secretary of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, France. Henri Braconnot, a French chemist, was also researching the composition of butter and was publishing his findings and this led to disputes about priority. As early as 1815, Chevreul claimed that he had found the substance responsible for the smell of butter. By 1817, he published some of his findings regarding the properties of butyric acid and named it. However, it was not until 1823 that he presented the properties of butyric acid in detail. The name butyric acid comes from , meaning &quot;butter&quot;, the substance in which it was first found. The Latin name &quot;butyrum&quot; (or &quot;buturum&quot;) is similar.

==Occurrence==
Triglycerides of butyric acid compose 3–4% of butter. When butter goes rancid, butyric acid is liberated from the glyceride by hydrolysis. It is one of the fatty acid subgroup called short-chain fatty acids. Butyric acid is a typical carboxylic acid that reacts with bases and affects many metals.
It is found in animal fat and plant oils, bovine milk, breast milk, butter, parmesan cheese, body odor, vomit and as a product of anaerobic fermentation (including in the colon). It has a taste somewhat like butter and an unpleasant odor. Mammals with good scent detection abilities, such as dogs, can detect it at 10 parts per billion, whereas humans can detect it only in concentrations above 10 parts per million. In food manufacturing, it is used as a flavoring agent.

In humans, butyric acid is one of two primary endogenous agonists of human hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (), a G protein-coupled receptor.

Butyric acid is present as its octyl ester in parsnip (&quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;) and in the seed of the ginkgo tree.

==Production==
===Industrial===
In industry, butyric acid is produced by hydroformylation from propene and syngas, forming butyraldehyde, which is oxidised to the final product.
: butyric acid
It can be separated from aqueous solutions by saturation with salts such as calcium chloride. The calcium salt, , is less soluble in hot water than in cold.

===Microbial biosynthesis===

Butyrate is produced by several fermentation processes performed by obligate anaerobic bacteria. This fermentation pathway was discovered by Louis Pasteur in 1861. Examples of butyrate-producing species of bacteria:

*&quot;Clostridium butyricum&quot;
*&quot;Clostridium kluyveri&quot;
*&quot;Clostridium pasteurianum&quot;
*&quot;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&quot;
*&quot;Fusobacterium nucleatum&quot;
*&quot;Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens&quot;
*&quot;Eubacterium limosum&quot;

The pathway starts with the glycolytic cleavage of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate, as happens in most organisms. Pyruvate is oxidized into acetyl coenzyme A catalyzed by . Two molecules of carbon dioxide () and two molecules of hydrogen () are formed as waste products. Subsequently, is produced in the last step of the fermentation. Three molecules of ATP are produced for each glucose molecule, a relatively high yield. The balanced equation for this fermentation is
Other pathways to butyrate include succinate reduction and crotonate disproportionation.

Several species form acetone and &quot;n&quot;-butanol in an alternative pathway, which starts as butyrate fermentation. Some of these species are:
*&quot;Clostridium acetobutylicum&quot;, the most prominent acetone and butanol producer, used also in industry
*&quot;Clostridium beijerinckii&quot;
*&quot;Clostridium tetanomorphum&quot;
*&quot;Clostridium aurantibutyricum&quot;

These bacteria begin with butyrate fermentation, as described above, but, when the pH drops below 5, they switch into butanol and acetone production to prevent further lowering of the pH. Two molecules of butanol are formed for each molecule of acetone.

The change in the pathway occurs after acetoacetyl CoA formation. This intermediate then takes two possible pathways:
*acetoacetyl CoA → acetoacetate → acetone
*acetoacetyl CoA → butyryl CoA → butyraldehyde → butanol

For commercial purposes Clostridium species are used preferably for butyric acid or butanol production.
The most common species used for probiotics is the Clostridium butyricum.

===Fermentable fiber sources===
Highly-fermentable fiber residues, such as those from resistant starch, oat bran, pectin, and guar are transformed by colonic bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) including butyrate, producing more SCFA than less fermentable fibers such as celluloses. One study found that resistant starch consistently produces more butyrate than other types of dietary fiber. The production of SCFA from fibers in ruminant animals such as cattle is responsible for the butyrate content of milk and butter.

Fructans are another source of prebiotic soluble dietary fibers which can be digested to produce butyrate. They are often found in the soluble fibers of foods which are high in sulfur, such as the allium and cruciferous vegetables. Sources of fructans include wheat (although some wheat strains such as spelt contain lower amounts), rye, barley, onion, garlic, Jerusalem and globe artichoke, asparagus, beetroot, chicory, dandelion leaves, leek, radicchio, the white part of spring onion, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, fennel, and prebiotics, such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), oligofructose, and inulin.

==Reactions==
Butyric acid reacts as a typical carboxylic acid: it can form amide, ester, anhydride, and chloride derivatives. The latter, butyryl chloride, is commonly used as the intermediate to obtain the others.

==Uses==
Butyric acid is used in the preparation of various butyrate esters. It is used to produce cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), which is used in a wide variety of tools, paints, and coatings, and is more resistant to degradation than cellulose acetate. CAB can degrade with exposure to heat and moisture, releasing butyric acid.

Low-molecular-weight esters of butyric acid, such as methyl butyrate, have mostly pleasant aromas or tastes. As a consequence, they are used as food and perfume additives. It is an approved food flavoring in the EU FLAVIS database (number 08.005).

Due to its powerful odor, it has also been used as a fishing bait additive. Many of the commercially available flavors used in carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) baits use butyric acid as their ester base. It is not clear whether fish are attracted by the butyric acid itself or the substances added to it. Butyric acid was one of the few organic acids shown to be palatable for both tench and bitterling. The substance has been used as a stink bomb by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to disrupt Japanese whaling crews.

==Pharmacology==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===

Butyric acid (pKa 4.82) is fully ionized at physiological pH, so its anion is the material that is mainly relevant in biological systems.
It is one of two primary endogenous agonists of human hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (, also known as GPR109A), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR),

Like other short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), butyrate is an agonist at the free fatty acid receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3, which function as nutrient sensors that facilitate the homeostatic control of energy balance; however, among the group of SCFAs, only butyrate is an agonist of HCA2. It is also an HDAC inhibitor (specifically, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8), a drug that inhibits the function of histone deacetylase enzymes, thereby favoring an acetylated state of histones in cells. Histone acetylation loosens the structure of chromatin by reducing the electrostatic attraction between histones and DNA. In general, it is thought that transcription factors will be unable to access regions where histones are tightly associated with DNA (i.e., non-acetylated, e.g., heterochromatin). Therefore, butyric acid is thought to enhance the transcriptional activity at promoters, which are typically silenced or downregulated due to histone deacetylase activity.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Butyrate that is produced in the colon through microbial fermentation of dietary fiber is primarily absorbed and metabolized by colonocytes and the liver for the generation of ATP during energy metabolism; however, some butyrate is absorbed in the distal colon, which is not connected to the portal vein, thereby allowing for the systemic distribution of butyrate to multiple organ systems through the circulatory system. Butyrate that has reached systemic circulation can readily cross the blood–brain barrier via monocarboxylate transporters (i.e., certain members of the SLC16A group of transporters). Other transporters that mediate the passage of butyrate across lipid membranes include SLC5A8 (SMCT1), SLC27A1 (FATP1), and SLC27A4 (FATP4).

===Metabolism ===

Butyric acid is metabolized by various human XM-ligases (ACSM1, ACSM2B, ASCM3, ACSM4, ACSM5, and ACSM6), also known as butyrate–CoA ligase. The metabolite produced by this reaction is butyryl–CoA, and is produced as follows:
:Adenosine triphosphate + butyric acid + coenzyme A → adenosine monophosphate + pyrophosphate + butyryl-CoA
As a short-chain fatty acid, butyrate is metabolized by mitochondria as an energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate or ATP) source through fatty acid metabolism. In particular, it is an important energy source for cells lining the mammalian colon (colonocytes). Without butyrates, colon cells undergo autophagy (i.e., self-digestion) and die.

In humans, the butyrate precursor tributyrin, which is naturally present in butter, is metabolized by triacylglycerol lipase into dibutyrin and butyrate through the reaction:
:Tributyrin + dibutyrin + butyric acid
==Biochemistry==

Butyrate has numerous effects on energy homeostasis and related diseases (diabetes and obesity), inflammation, and immune function (e.g., it has pronounced antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic effects) in humans. These effects occur through its metabolism by mitochondria to generate during fatty acid metabolism or through one or more of its histone-modifying enzyme targets (i.e., the class I histone deacetylases) and G-protein coupled receptor targets (i.e., FFAR2, FFAR3, and ).

===In the mammalian gut===
Butyrate is essential to host immune homeostasis. Although the role and importance of butyrate in the gut is not fully understood, many researchers argue that a depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria in patients with several vasculitic conditions is essential to the pathogenesis of these disorders. A depletion of butyrate in the gut is typically caused by an absence or depletion of butyrate-producing-bacteria (BPB). This depletion in BPB leads to microbial dysbiosis. This is characterized by an overall low biodiversity and a depletion of key butyrate-producing members. Butyrate is an essential microbial metabolite with a vital role as a modulator of proper immune function in the host. It has been shown that children lacking in BPB are more susceptible to allergic disease and Type 1 Diabetes. Butyrate is also reduced in a diet low in dietary fiber, which can induce inflammation and have other adverse affects insofar as these short-chain fatty acids activate PPAR-γ.

Butyrate exerts a key role for the maintenance of immune homeostasis both locally (in the gut) and systemically (via circulating butyrate). It has been shown to promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells. In particular, circulating butyrate prompts the generation of extrathymic regulatory T cells. The low-levels of butyrate in human subjects could favor reduced regulatory T cell-mediated control, thus promoting a powerful immuno-pathological T-cell response. On the other hand, gut butyrate has been reported to inhibit local pro-inflammatory cytokines. The absence or depletion of these BPB in the gut could therefore be a possible aide in the overly-active inflammatory response. Butyrate in the gut also protects the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Decreased butyrate levels therefore lead to a damaged or dysfunctional intestinal epithelial barrier. Butyrate reduction has also been associated with &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; proliferation. Conversely, a high-fiber diet results in higher butyric acid concentration and inhibition of &quot;C. difficile&quot; growth.

In a 2013 research study conducted by Furusawa et al., microbe-derived butyrate was found to be essential in inducing the differentiation of colonic regulatory T cells in mice. This is of great importance and possibly relevant to the pathogenesis and vasculitis associated with many inflammatory diseases because regulatory T cells have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses. In several research studies, it has been demonstrated that butyrate induced the differentiation of regulatory T cells in vitro and in vivo. The anti-inflammatory capacity of butyrate has been extensively analyzed and supported by many studies. It has been found that microorganism-produced butyrate expedites the production of regulatory T cells, although the specific mechanism by which it does so is unclear. More recently, it has been shown that butyrate plays an essential and direct role in modulating gene expression of cytotoxic T-cells. Butyrate also has an anti-inflammatory effect on neutrophils, reducing their migration to wounds. This effect is mediated via the receptor .

In the gut microbiomes found in the class Mammalia, omnivores and herbivores have butyrate-producing bacterial communities dominated by the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase pathway, whereas carnivores have butyrate-producing bacterial communities dominated by the butyrate kinase pathway.

The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on ticks as a signal.

===Immunomodulation and inflammation===
Butyrate&#x27;s effects on the immune system are mediated through the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases and activation of its G-protein coupled receptor targets:  (GPR109A), FFAR2 (GPR43), and FFAR3 (GPR41). Among the short-chain fatty acids, butyrate is the most potent promoter of intestinal regulatory T cells &quot;in vitro&quot; and the only one among the group that is an ligand. It has been shown to be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. It possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer.

Butyrate has established antimicrobial properties in humans that are mediated through the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, which it induces via HDAC inhibition on histone H3. In vitro, butyrate increases gene expression of FOXP3 (the transcription regulator for ) and promotes colonic regulatory T cells (Tregs) through the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases; through these actions, it increases the expression of interleukin 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Butyrate also suppresses colonic inflammation by inhibiting the IFN-γ–STAT1 signaling pathways, which is mediated partially through histone deacetylase inhibition. While transient IFN-γ signaling is generally associated with normal host immune response, chronic IFN-γ signaling is often associated with chronic inflammation. It has been shown that butyrate inhibits activity of HDAC1 that is bound to the Fas gene promoter in T cells, resulting in hyperacetylation of the Fas promoter and up-regulation of Fas receptor on the T-cell surface.

Similar to other agonists studied, butyrate also produces marked anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of tissues, including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and vascular tissue. Butyrate binding at FFAR3 induces neuropeptide Y release and promotes the functional homeostasis of colonic mucosa and the enteric immune system.

===Cancer===
Butyrate has been shown to be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. It is responsible for about 70% of energy from the colonocytes, being a critical SCFA in colon homeostasis. Butyrate possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer. It produces different effects in healthy and cancerous cells: this is known as the &quot;butyrate paradox&quot;. In particular, butyrate inhibits colonic tumor cells and stimulates proliferation of healthy colonic epithelial cells. The explanation why butyrate is an energy source for normal colonocytes and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells, is the Warburg effect in cancer cells, which leads to butyrate not being properly metabolized. This phenomenon leads to the accumulation of butyrate in the nucleus, acting as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. One mechanism underlying butyrate function in suppression of colonic inflammation is inhibition of the IFN-γ/STAT1 signalling pathways. It has been shown that butyrate inhibits activity of HDAC1 that is bound to the Fas gene promoter in T cells, resulting in hyperacetylation of the Fas promoter and upregulation of Fas receptor on the T cell surface. It is thus suggested that butyrate enhances apoptosis of T cells in the colonic tissue and thereby eliminates the source of inflammation (IFN-γ production). Butyrate inhibits angiogenesis by inactivating Sp1 transcription factor activity and downregulating vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression.

In summary, the production of volatile fatty acids such as butyrate from fermentable fibers may contribute to the role of dietary fiber in colon cancer. Short-chain fatty acids, which include butyric acid, are produced by beneficial colonic bacteria (probiotics) that feed on, or ferment prebiotics, which are plant products that contain dietary fiber. These short-chain fatty acids benefit the colonocytes by increasing energy production, and may protect against colon cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation.

Conversely, some researchers have sought to eliminate butyrate and consider it a potential cancer driver. Studies in mice indicate it drives transformation of MSH2-deficient colon epithelial cells.

===Potential treatments from butyrate restoration===
Owing to the importance of butyrate as an inflammatory regulator and immune system contributor, butyrate depletions could be a key factor influencing the pathogenesis of many vasculitic conditions. It is thus essential to maintain healthy levels of butyrate in the gut. Fecal microbiota transplants (to restore BPB and symbiosis in the gut) could be effective by replenishing butyrate levels. In this treatment, a healthy individual donates their stool to be transplanted into an individual with dysbiosis. A less-invasive treatment option is the administration of butyrate—as oral supplements or enemas—which has been shown to be very effective in terminating symptoms of inflammation with minimal-to-no side-effects. In a study where patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with butyrate enemas, inflammation decreased significantly, and bleeding ceased completely after butyrate provision.

===Addiction===
Butyric acid is an inhibitor that is selective for class I HDACs in humans. HDACs are histone-modifying enzymes that can cause histone deacetylation and repression of gene expression. HDACs are important regulators of synaptic formation, synaptic plasticity, and long-term memory formation. Class I HDACs are known to be involved in mediating the development of an addiction. Butyric acid and other HDAC inhibitors have been used in preclinical research to assess the transcriptional, neural, and behavioral effects of HDAC inhibition in animals addicted to drugs.

<text>An unincorporated area is a parcel of land that is not governed by a local general-purpose municipal corporation. They may be governed or serviced by an encompassing unit (such as a county) or another branch of the state (such as the military). There are many unincorporated communities and areas in the United States and Canada, but many countries do not use the concept of an unincorporated area. 

==By country==
=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, the provinces of Chubut, Córdoba, Entre Ríos, Formosa, Neuquén, Río Negro, San Luis, Santa Cruz, Santiago del Estero, Tierra del Fuego, and Tucumán have areas that are outside any municipality or commune.

===Australia===

Unlike many other countries, Australia has only one level of local government immediately beneath state and territorial governments. A local government area (LGA) often contains several towns and even entire metropolitan areas. Thus, aside from very sparsely populated areas and a few other unique cases, almost all of Australia is part of an LGA. Unincorporated areas are often in remote locations, cover vast areas, or have very small populations.

Postal addresses in unincorporated areas, as in other parts of Australia, normally use the suburb or locality names gazetted by the relevant state or territorial government. Thus, any ambiguity regarding addresses rarely exists in unincorporated areas.

===Canada===
In Canada, depending on the province, an unincorporated settlement is one that does not have a municipal council that governs solely over the settlement. It is usually, but not always, part of a larger municipal government. These range from small hamlets to large urbanized areas similar in size to a town or city.

In Alberta, unincorporated communities can be classified as Hamlet, Locality or townsite. A Hamlet is an unincorporated community that can be designated by the council of Municipal District or Specialized Municipality within their boundaries, or by the Minister of Municipal Affairs within the boundaries of an Improvement District.

For example, were they incorporated, the urban service areas of Fort McMurray in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo and Sherwood Park in Strathcona County would be the fifth- and sixth-largest cities in Alberta.

Unincorporated settlements with a population between 100 and 1,000 residents may have the status of designated place in Canadian census data.

In some provinces, large tracts of undeveloped wilderness or rural country are unorganized areas that fall directly under the provincial jurisdiction. Some unincorporated settlements in such unorganized areas may have some types of municipal services provided to them by a quasigovernmental agency such as a local services board in Ontario. In New Brunswick, where a significant population lives in a local service district, taxation and services may come directly from the province.

===Czech Republic=== 
The entire area of the Czech Republic is divided into municipalities; the only exceptions are four military training areas. These are parts of the regions and do not form self-governing municipalities, but are rather governed by military offices (&quot;újezdní úřad&quot;), which are subordinate to the Ministry of Defence.

Note: The Brdy Military Area was abandoned by the Army in 2015 and converted into a protected landscape area, with its area being incorporated either into existing municipalities or into newly established municipalities based on the existing settlements. The other four military training areas were reduced in size in 2015 too. The decisions on whether the settlements joined existing municipalities or formed new ones were made by plebiscites.

===Denmark===
Ertholmene is a small group of islands that forms the easternmost part of Denmark. This small archipelago lies 20 kilometers northeast of Bornholm and is the only part of metropolitan Denmark which is not part of a municipality. The islands have been under military jurisdiction since 1685 when Denmark turned Christiansø into a naval base in response to Sweden creating Karlskrona naval base a few years earlier. In 1926, the entire area was declared protected cultural heritage. Population of less than 100. Statistics Denmark groups it with Bornholm in Landsdel Bornholm.

===Germany===
Since Germany has no administrative level comparable to the townships of other countries, the vast majority of the country, close to 99%, is organized in municipalities (, plural &#x27;), often consisting of multiple settlements that are not considered to be unincorporated. Because these settlements lack a council of their own, usually an &#x27; or &quot; (village chairman / chairwoman) is appointed by the municipal council, except in the very smallest villages.

In 2000, the number of unincorporated areas in Germany, called (municipality-free areas) or singular &quot;, was 295 with a total area of and around 1.4% of its territory. However, these are mostly unpopulated areas such as forests, lakes and their surroundings, military training areas, and the like.

, Germany had 248 uninhabited unincorporated areas (of which 214 are located in Bavaria), not belonging to any municipality, consisting mostly of forested areas, lakes, and larger rivers. Also, three inhabited unincorporated areas exist, all of which served as military training areas: Osterheide and Lohheide in Lower Saxony, and Gutsbezirk Münsingen in Baden-Württemberg. They have fewer than 2,000 inhabitants in total. Gutsbezirk Münsingen has become uninhabited after losing its inhabited parts to adjacent municipalities on 1 January 2011.

==== Largest ====
The following shows the largest unincorporated areas in Germany (including all inhabited areas, but excluding lakes) with an area of more than :


In Bavaria, there are other contiguous unincorporated areas covering an area of more than which are however composed of several adjacent unincorporated areas, each one of which is under 50 km2 in area.

===Israel===
In Israel, almost all land is subdivided into 393 municipalities which are further classified, normally by population, as city, local council, or regional council. All three types of municipality provide services including zoning and planning.

However, a few unincorporated areas exist, whether because of omissions and ambiguities left in official maps dating from the British Mandate for Palestine, or due to deliberate policy of ensuring facilities of national importance, such as Ben Gurion Airport, Mikveh Israel boarding school, or the BAZAN Group oil refineries, would not have their operation affected by local considerations.

The largest unincorporated area in Israel is the so-called &quot;Reservation area&quot;, a triangular region whose vertexes are Beersheba, Dimona and Arad, in which all Negev Bedouins were concentrated in the 1950s. As no municipal services are provided within unincorporated areas, this effectively makes all Bedouin settlements in the area unrecognized, with the sole exception of those that were included from 2003 within the Abu Basma Regional Council. On 5 November 2012 that council was split into two new councils, Neve Midbar Regional Council and al-Kasom Regional Council.

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands has had regular periods with unincorporated land when newly reclaimed land polders fall dry. Unincorporated land is since medieval times administered by an appointed officer with the name &quot;Landdrost&quot; or &quot;Drossaart&quot;. Also, Elten and Tudderen, both annexed from Germany after World War II, were governed by a &quot;Landdrost &quot;until they were ceded back to Germany in 1963.

The most recent period with unincorporated land started in 1967, when the dyke around Southern Flevoland was closed, but several years are required before the polder is genuinely accessible for cultivation, and construction of roads and homes can start, as in the first years, the soil is equivalent to quicksand. During the initial period of inhabitation, a special, government-appointed officer was installed, the &quot;landdrost&quot;. During the administrative office of a&quot; Landdrost&quot;, no municipal council forms.

In 1975, the first homes in what is now the city of Almere were built, and from 1976 to 1984, the area was governed by the &quot;Landdrost&quot; as the executive of the &quot;Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders&quot; (Southern IJsselmeerpolders Public Body). In 1984, the &quot;Landdrost&quot; became the first mayor of the new city Almere. Since that date, the Netherlands does not have any unincorporated land areas.

The &quot;Openbaar Lichaam&quot; remained, however, only governing the water body of the Markermeer. After the municipal division of the Wadden Sea (1985), the territorial waters in the North Sea (1991) and the IJsselmeer (1994), all water bodies are now also part of a municipality and no unincorporated areas exist in the Netherlands anymore. The &quot;Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders&quot; was dissolved in 1996.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand outlying islands are offshore island groups that are part of New Zealand. The Chatham Islands is the only island group among these that are populated and it has its own territorial authority. Most of the other island groups are not part of any administrative region or district, but are instead each designated as an &quot;Area Outside Territorial Authority&quot;.

===Norway===
In Norway, the outlying islands of Bouvet Island, Jan Mayen, and Svalbard are outside of all of the country&#x27;s counties and municipalities. They are ruled directly by national authorities without any local democracy. An exception is the Longyearbyen Community Council in Svalbard, which since 2004 in reality acts partly like a Norwegian municipality. Svalbard has a governor appointed by the government of Norway, ruling the area. Jan Mayen has no population, only radio and weather stations with staff, whose manager has the responsibility for the activities. Bouvet Island has only occasional visitors.

===United States===
In local government in the United States, the term &quot;unincorporated area&quot; usually refers to the part of a county that is outside of any general-purpose municipal government. An unincorporated community is one general term for a geographic area having a common social identity without municipal organization or official political designation (i.e., incorporation as a city or town). The two main types of unincorporated communities are:

* a neighborhood or other community existing within one or across multiple existing incorporated areas (i.e., cities or towns). In this sense, a community is part of a municipal government but not &quot;separately&quot; incorporated from it. For example, Hyannis, Massachusetts, is an unincorporated village within the town of Barnstable, and Intervale, New Hampshire, is an unincorporated community on the border of the towns of Bartlett and Conway.
* a neighborhood or other community existing outside an incorporated municipal government. In this sense, the community is outside any municipal government and is entirely unincorporated. Examples include Hovland, Minnesota; Nutbush, Tennessee; and Yucca, Arizona; all are small rural settlements of low population.

Most states have granted some form of home rule, so that county commissions (or boards or councils) have the same powers in these areas as city councils or town councils have in their respective incorporated areas. Some states instead put these powers in the hands of townships, which are minor civil divisions of each county and are called &quot;towns&quot; in some states.

Differences in state laws regarding the incorporation of communities leads to a great variation in the distribution and nature of unincorporated areas. Unincorporated regions are essentially nonexistent in eight of the northeastern states. All of the land in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island, and nearly all of the land in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, is part of an incorporated area of some type. In these areas, types (and official names) of local government entities can vary. In New England (which includes five of those eight states, plus the less fully incorporated state of Maine), local municipalities are known as towns or cities, and most towns are administered by a form of direct democracy, such as the open town meeting or representative town meeting. Larger towns in New England may be incorporated as cities, with some form of mayor-council government. In New Jersey, multiple types exist, as well, such as city, township, town, borough, or village, but these differences are in the structure of the legislative branches, not in the powers or functions of the entities themselves.
On the opposite end of the spectrum is the Virginia &quot;strong county&quot; model. Virginia and other states with this model, such as Alabama, Maryland, and Tennessee, set strict requirements on incorporation or grant counties broad powers that in other states are carried out by cities, creating a disincentive to incorporate, and thus have large urbanized areas which have no municipal government below the county level.

In mid-Atlantic states such as New York and Pennsylvania, a hybrid model that tries to balance the two approaches is prevalent, with differing allocations of power between municipalities and counties existing.

Throughout the U.S., some large cities have annexed all surrounding unincorporated areas within their counties, creating what are known as consolidated city–county forms of government (e.g., Jacksonville, Florida, and Nashville, Tennessee). In these cases, unincorporated areas continue to exist in other counties of their respective metropolitan areas. Conversely, a county island is surrounded on most or all sides by municipalities. In areas of sparse population, the majority of the land in any given state may be unincorporated.

Some states, including North Carolina, grant extraterritorial jurisdiction to cities and towns (but rarely villages) so that they may control zoning for a limited distance into adjacent unincorporated areas, often as a precursor (and sometimes as a legal requirement) to later annexation of those areas. This is especially useful in rural counties that have no zoning at all, or only spot zoning for unincorporated communities.

In California, all counties except the City and County of San Francisco have unincorporated areas. Even in highly populated counties, the unincorporated portions may contain a large number of inhabitants. In Los Angeles County, the county government estimates the population of its unincorporated areas to exceed one million people. Despite having 88 incorporated cities and towns, including the state&#x27;s most populous, 65% of the land in Los Angeles County is unincorporated, this mostly consisting of Angeles National Forest and sparsely populated regions to its north. In California, the state constitution recognizes only one kind of municipality, the city. The California Government Code allows cities to call themselves towns, if they wish, although the designation is purely cosmetic.

====Insular areas====
In the context of the insular areas of the United States, the word &quot;unincorporated&quot; refers to territories in which the United States Congress has determined that only selected parts of the Constitution of the United States apply and which have not been formally incorporated into the United States by Congress. Currently, the five major unincorporated U.S. insular areas are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Unincorporated insular areas can be ceded to another nation or be granted independence. The U.S. has one incorporated insular area, Palmyra Atoll. Incorporation is regarded as perpetual by the U.S. federal government; once incorporated, the territory cannot be disincorporated. The United States Minor Outlying Islands without a permanent civilian population are &quot;unorganized&quot; in the sense that they do not have a local government, and they are administered by the Office of Insular Affairs directly. The populated American Samoa is &quot;unorganized&quot; in the sense that Congress has not passed an organic act, but it does have a constitution and locally elected territorial legislature and executive.

====U.S. Census Bureau====
An unincorporated community may be part of a census-designated place (CDP). A CDP is an area defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. It is a populated area that generally includes one officially designated but currently unincorporated community for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions, and occasionally other smaller unincorporated communities as well. Otherwise, it has no legal status.

The Census Bureau designates some unincorporated areas as &quot;unorganized territories&quot;, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau where portions of counties are not included in any legally established minor civil division (MCD) or independent incorporated place. These occur in 10 MCD states: Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, and South Dakota. The census recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for statistical purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation &quot;unorganized territory&quot;. Unorganized territories were first used for statistical purposes in conjunction with the 1960 census.

At the 2000 census there were 305 of these territories within the United States. Their total land area was 85,392 square miles (221,165 km2) and they had a total population of 247,331. South Dakota had the most unorganized territories, 102, as well as the largest amount of land under that status: 39,785 square miles (103,042 km2), or 52.4% of the state&#x27;s land area. North Dakota followed with 86 territories, 20,358 square miles (52,728 km2), or 29.5% of its land area. Maine was next with 36 territories, 14,052 square miles (36,396 km2), or 45.5% of its land area. Minnesota had 71 territories, 10,552 square miles (27,330 km2), or 13% of its land area. Several other states had small amounts of unorganized territory. The unorganized territory with the largest population was Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, a United States Marine Corps base with a census population of 34,452 inhabitants.

In the 2010 census, unorganized territory areas were identified in nine U.S. states: Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

====U.S. mail delivery====
Many unincorporated communities are also recognized as acceptable place names for use in mailing addresses by the United States Postal Service (USPS) (indeed, some have their own post offices), and the Census Bureau uses the names of some widely recognized unincorporated communities for its CDPs for which it tabulates census data. In some instances, unincorporated areas have a mailing address indicating the name of an incorporated city, as well as those where residents of one incorporated city have mailing addresses indicating another incorporated city. Mailing addresses do not necessarily change whether an area becomes a part of an incorporated place, changes to another incorporated place, or disincorporates. For example, places in Kingwood, Texas, previously unincorporated, retained &quot;Kingwood, TX&quot; mailing addresses after the 1996 annexation of Kingwood into the city of Houston. The Houston city government stated on its website, &quot;The U.S. Postal Service establishes ZIP codes and mailing addresses to maximize the efficiency of their system, not to recognize jurisdictional boundaries.&quot;

The USPS is very conservative about recognizing new place names for use in mailing addresses and typically only does so when a place incorporates. The original place name associated with a ZIP Code is still maintained as the default place name, even though the name of the newly incorporated place is more accurate. As an example, Sandy Springs is one of the most populated places in Georgia but is served by a branch of the Atlanta post office. Only after the city was incorporated in 2005 was &quot;Sandy Springs&quot; approved for use in mailing addresses, though &quot;Atlanta&quot; remains the default name. Accordingly, &quot;Atlanta&quot; is the only accepted place name for mailing addresses in the nearby unincorporated town of Vinings, also served by a branch of the Atlanta post office, even though Vinings is in Cobb County and Atlanta is in Fulton and DeKalb counties. In contrast, neighboring Mableton has not been incorporated in nearly a century, but has its own post office and thus &quot;Mableton&quot; is the only acceptable place name for mailing addresses in the town. The areas of Dulah and Faria, California, which are unincorporated areas in Ventura County between Ventura and Carpinteria, have the ZIP Code of 93001, which is assigned to the post office at 675 E. Santa Clara St. in Ventura; thus, all mail to those two areas is addressed to Ventura.

If an unincorporated area becomes incorporated, it may be split among ZIP Codes, and its new name may be recognized as acceptable for use with some or all of them in mailing addresses, as has been the case in Johns Creek and Milton, Georgia. If an incorporated area disincorporates, though, this has no effect on whether a place name is &quot;acceptable&quot; in a mailing address or not, as is the case with Lithia Springs, Georgia. ZIP Code boundaries often ignore political boundaries, so the appearance of a place name in a mailing address alone does not indicate whether the place is incorporated or unincorporated.

====Populated place====
Unincorporated areas with permanent populations in the United States are defined by the United States Geological Survey as &quot;populated places&quot;, a &quot;place or area with clustered or scattered buildings, and a permanent human population (city, settlement, town, village).&quot; No legal boundaries exist, although a corresponding &quot;civil&quot; record may occur, the boundaries of which may or may not match the perceived populated place.

=== Other nations ===
Some nations have some exceptional unincorporated areas:

* The Lok Ma Chau Loop in Hong Kong is the only part of China not incorporated into any third-level administrative division.
* The Kingdom of Denmark has three unincorporated areas:
** In Denmark proper, the former naval fortress Ertholmene east of Bornholm with less than 100 inhabitants is still governed directly by the Ministry of Defence.
** In Greenland, all land is incorporated except for the Northeast Greenland National Park and the Pituffik Space Base.
* In France, all land is incorporated except for Clipperton Island, a small overseas island possession held as an overseas state private property under the direct authority of the French government, administered by France&#x27;s Overseas Minister.
* In France, the territory is subdivided into 36,685 &quot;communes&quot; (municipalities). An elected council and a mayor form the governing body of a municipality. This applies to mainland France and to overseas departments and regions, however, some territories like Clipperton Island are not incorporated. Six communes depopulated during World War I were maintained incorporated for memorial reasons, although they have no population.
* In India, there are several union territories (central government administered regions). Unlike the states of India, which have their own governments, union territories are federal territories governed, in part or in whole, by the Government of India. Many of these were created at the time of India&#x27;s independence or after being acquired from non-British colonial powers or princely states.
* Azad Kashmir has no official status in Pakistani law, but is nonetheless &quot;de facto&quot; governed by Pakistan.
* Slovakia is divided into municipalities. There are two types of municipalities: towns (, pl. &#x27;) and villages (&#x27;, pl. &quot;&quot;), with minor differences between them. Additionally, there are several military areas which are not part of any municipality. Each military area is a municipality of its own right. However, the military areas hold no elections and have no mayors or other elected representatives. Instead, they are administered directly by the Slovak Ministry of Defence.
* In Spain, the Spanish Constitution of 1978 says that the land is divided into autonomous communities, provinces, and municipalities. Each of these have certain powers determined by law. Autonomous Communities and municipalities are enabled to appeal to the Constitutional Court any public decision that violates their autonomy by other entities (State or Autonomous Community power).&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, some regions, like Navarre, have some unincorporated areas. The largest of these, the Bardenas Reales, has a surface of and is governed by a board of representatives of 20 bordering municipalities, a valley in the Pyrenees, and a monastery, all of which have rights to use the area. The plazas de soberanía also functions as &quot;de facto&quot; unincorporated areas under the administration of the Spanish Ministry of Defence. 
* Switzerland also has a few exceptions: 22 lakes and a forest, as described by the Swiss federal statistical office (See: Gemeindefreie Gebiete ).
* In Ukraine, all land is divided into hromadas except for the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The latter contains parts of Kyiv Oblast and Zhytomyr Oblast and is directly administered by a designated government agency.

==Countries without unincorporated areas==
Many countries, especially those with many centuries of history with multiple tiers of local government, do not use the concept of an unincorporated area.

* The whole of the territories of Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Metropolitan France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Montenegro, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, and Sweden are divided into municipalities.
* In Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, all land must belong to a municipality. Even large uninhabited areas, such as forests or grasslands, are, by law, part of the nearest &quot;city&quot;. This is because in Latin America, a &quot;municipality&quot; in some senses is the equivalent of what in the United States and Canada is called a &quot;county&quot;.
* In Mainland China, every piece of land belongs to a county-level (third level) administrative division (equivalent to a municipality), either a district (区 qū) in an urban area, or a county-level city (县级市 xiànjíshì), county (县 xiàn) or banner (旗 qí). There is also a township-level (fourth level) administrative division, which may be a subdistrict (街道 jiēdào), town (镇 zhèn), township (乡 xiāng), or sumu (苏木 sūmù).
* In Croatia, every piece of land belongs either to a city () or to a municipality ().
* In Estonia, the entire territory is divided into 79 municipalities, of which 14 are municipal towns and 65 are parishes. The entire territory of the country is divided into settlements of four types: towns, boroughs, small boroughs and villages.
* In Indonesia, every piece of land belongs to a municipality (&quot;kota&quot;) or a regency ().
* In Japan, every piece of land belongs to a municipality, of which there are four types: cities (市 &quot;shi&quot;); the special wards (特別区 &quot;tokubetsu-ku&quot;) of Tokyo; towns (町 &quot;chō&quot; or &quot;machi&quot;); villages (村 &quot;mura&quot; or &quot;son&quot;). The four southernmost islands of Hachijō Subprefecture are currently not part of any municipality as the town of Hachijō and village of Aogashima both claim administrative rights.
* In Peru, the whole territory is divided into districts (&quot;distritos&quot;), which form provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;), which form regions (&quot;regiones&quot;). Some districts, especially in the Amazon, are vast portions of territory, but they are governed from a district capital (which can be anywhere from a city to a small village).
* In the Philippines, all land belongs to either a city or a municipality, which are further subdivided into barangays.
* In Portugal, the constitution defines territorial divisions as parishes, municipalities, and administrative regions. It has no official definition of city limits, so a city may include several parishes, or a parish may cover several villages or townships, but a municipality is usually administered from the city or town that bears its name.
* In South Africa, the constitution gives every place in the country democratically elected third-tier government.
* In South Korea, every piece of land belongs to a municipality, either a district (구 gu) in a city (시 shi) or a town (읍 eub) or township (면 myeon) in a county (군 gun).
* In Sweden, all territory is divided into municipalities. Sweden has post-glacial rebound, so the land area is increasing, but municipal boundaries extend into the sea, so new land is not unincorporated.
* In the free area of the Republic of China (Taiwan Island, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and some minor islands), every piece of land belongs to either a township or a county-administered city in county, or district in provincial city. There are, in total, 368 townships, county-administered cities and districts in Taiwan. See also: administrative divisions of Taiwan.
* In the United Kingdom:
** In England, all land is within a county or local government district, both of which exercise power over their jurisdictions.
** In Northern Ireland, all land is within one of 11 districts.
** In Scotland, all land is within one of 32 unitary authorities designated as councils.
** In Wales, all land is within one of 22 single-tier principal areas.

<doc id="232367" wikidata="Q70784" url="?curid=232367" title="Journey to the West">
<text>Journey to the West () is a Chinese novel published in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty and attributed to Wu Cheng&#x27;en. It is regarded as one of the great Chinese novels, and has been described as arguably the most popular literary work in East Asia. It is widely known in English-speaking countries through Arthur Waley&#x27;s 1942 abridged translation, &quot;Monkey&quot;.

The novel is a fictionalized and fantastic account of the pilgrimage of the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang, who journeyed to India in the 7th century AD to seek out and collect Buddhist scriptures (sūtras). The novel retains the broad outline of Xuanzang&#x27;s own account, &quot;Great Tang Records on the Western Regions&quot;, but embellishes it with fantasy elements from folk tales and the author&#x27;s invention. In the story, the Buddha tasks the monk Tang Sanzang (or &quot;Tripitaka&quot;), with journeying to India and provides him with three protectors who agree to help him in order to atone for their sins: Sun Wukong (the &quot;Monkey King&quot;), Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing. Riding a White Dragon Horse, the monk and his three protectors journey to a mythical version of India and enlightenment through the power and virtue of cooperation.

&quot;Journey to the West&quot; has strong roots in Chinese folk religion, Chinese mythology, Chinese Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoist and Buddhist folklore, and the pantheon of Taoist immortals and Buddhist bodhisattvas are still reflective of certain Chinese religious attitudes today, while being the inspiration of many modern manhwa, manhua, manga and anime series. Enduringly popular, the novel is at once a comic adventure story, a humorous satire of Chinese bureaucracy, a source of spiritual insight, and an extended allegory.

==History==
===Creation and authorship===

The modern 100-chapter form of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; dates from the 16th century. Embellished stories based on Xuanzang&#x27;s journey to India had circulated through oral storytelling for centuries. They appeared in book form as early as the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). The &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot;, completed in 1408, contains excerpts of a version of the story written in colloquial Chinese, and a Korean book from 1423 also includes a fragment of that story. The earliest surviving edition of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; was published in Nanjing in 1592. Two earlier editions were published between 1522 and 1566, but no copies of them survived.

The authorship of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; is traditionally ascribed to Wu Cheng&#x27;en, but the question is complicated by the fact that much of the novel&#x27;s material originated from folk tales. Anthony C. Yu, writing in 2012, warned that &quot;this vexing dispute over the novel&#x27;s authorship, similar to that on the priority of its textual versions, see-sawed back and forth for nearly a century without resolution.&quot;

Hu Shih, literary scholar, former Chancellor of Peking University, and then Ambassador to the United States, wrote in 1942 that the novel was thought to have been written and published anonymously by Wu Cheng&#x27;en. He reasoned that the people of Wu&#x27;s hometown attributed it to him early on, and kept records to that effect as early as 1625; thus, claimed Hu, &quot;Journey to the West&quot; was one of the earliest Chinese novels for which the authorship is officially documented.

More recent scholarship casts doubts on this attribution. Brown University Chinese literature scholar David Lattimore stated in 1983: &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s confidence was quite unjustified. What the gazetteer says is that Wu wrote something called &quot;The Journey to the West.&quot; It mentions nothing about a novel. The work in question could have been any version of our story, or something else entirely.&quot; Translator W. J. F. Jenner pointed out that although Wu had knowledge of Chinese bureaucracy and politics, the novel itself does not include any political details that &quot;a fairly well-read commoner could not have known.&quot;

One interpretive tradition views &quot;Journey to the West&quot; as the outcome of a writing game which was popular among Chinese literati.

The overall plot of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; was &quot;already a part of Chinese folk and literary tradition in the form of &quot;folk stories with informal language&quot;, a poetic novelette, and a six-part drama play series, which was transcribed and written down, before the current version was written. Fragments of an earlier text, &quot;Journey to the West as Storytelling&quot;, are recorded in other texts. The narrative threads from this earlier text which survive are the wager between the Dragon King of the Jing River and fortune teller Yuan Shoucheng and the contest between the pilgrims and the three Taoist demons in Cart Slow Kingdom.

Regardless of the origins and authorship, &quot;Journey to the West&quot; has become the authoritative version of these folk stories, and while the cumulative authorship of the text is acknowledged, Wu is generally accepted as the author of the 1592 printed version widely considered canonical.

===Historical basis===


Although &quot;Journey to the West&quot; is a work of fantasy, it is based on the actual journey of the Chinese monk Xuanzang (602–664), who traveled to India in the 7th century in order to seek out Buddhist scriptures and bring them back to China. Xuanzang was a monk at Jingtu Temple in the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an (present-day Xi&#x27;an) during the late Sui dynasty and early Tang dynasty. He left Chang&#x27;an in 629, in defiance of Emperor Taizong of Tang&#x27;s ban on travel. Helped by sympathetic Buddhists, Xuanzang traveled via Gansu and Qinghai to Kumul (Hami), thence following the Tian Shan mountains to Turpan. He then crossed regions that are today Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, into Gandhara, in what is today northern Pakistan, in 630. Xuanzang traveled throughout India for the next thirteen years, visiting important Buddhist pilgrimage sites, studying at the ancient university at Nalanda, and debating the rivals of Buddhism.

Xuanzang left India in 643 and arrived back in Chang&#x27;an in 646. Although he had defied the imperial travel ban when he left, Xuanzang received a warm welcome from Emperor Taizong upon his return. The emperor provided money and support for Xuanzang&#x27;s projects. He joined Da Ci&#x27;en Monastery (Monastery of Great Maternal Grace), where he led the building of the Big Wild Goose Pagoda to store the scriptures and icons he had brought back from India. He recorded his journey in the book &quot;Great Tang Records on the Western Regions&quot;. With the support of the emperor, he established an institute at Yuhua Gong (Palace of the Luster of Jade) monastery dedicated to translating the scriptures he had brought back. His translation and commentary work established him as the founder of the Dharma character school of Buddhism. Xuanzang died on 7 March 664. The Xingjiao Monastery was established in 669 to house his ashes.

==Synopsis==

The novel has 100 chapters that can be divided into four unequal parts.

===First Part===
The first part, which includes chapters 1–7, is a self-contained introduction to the main story. It deals entirely with the earlier exploits of Sun Wukong, a monkey born from a stone nourished by the Five Elements, who learns the art of the Tao, 72 polymorphic transformations, combat, and secrets of immortality, and whose guile and force earns him the name &quot;Qitian Dasheng&quot; (), or &quot;Great Sage Equal to Heaven.&quot; His powers grow to match the forces of all of the Eastern (Taoist) deities, and the prologue culminates in Sun&#x27;s rebellion against Heaven, during a time when he garnered a post in the celestial bureaucracy. Hubris proves his downfall when the Buddha manages to trap him under a mountain, sealing it with a talisman for five hundred years.

===Second Part===
The second part (chapters 8–12) introduces Tang Sanzang through his early biography and the background to his great journey. Dismayed that &quot;the land of the South (i.e. Tang China) knows only greed, hedonism, promiscuity, and sins,&quot; the Buddha instructs the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (Guanyin) to search China for someone to take the Buddhist sutras of &quot;transcendence and persuasion for good will&quot; back. Part of this section also relates to how Tang Sanzang becomes a monk (as well as revealing his past life as a disciple of the Buddha named &quot;Golden Cicada&quot; ( &quot;Jīn Chánzi&quot;) and comes about being sent on this pilgrimage by Emperor Taizong, who previously escaped death with the help of an official in the Underworld. In the story, Tang Sanzang is considered an allegorical representation of the human heart.

===Third Part===
The third and longest section of the work is chapters 13–99, an episodic adventure story in which Tang Sanzang sets out to bring back Buddhist scriptures from Leiyin Temple on Vulture Peak in India, but encounters various evils along the way. The section is set in the sparsely populated lands along the Silk Road between China and India. The geography described in the book is, however, almost entirely fantasy; once Tang Sanzang departs Chang&#x27;an, the Tang capital, and crosses the frontier (somewhere in Gansu province), he finds himself in a wilderness of deep gorges and tall mountains, inhabited by demons and animal spirits who regard him as a potential meal (since his flesh was believed to give immortality to whoever ate it), with the occasional hidden monastery or royal city-state amidst the harsh setting.

Episodes consist of 1–4 chapters and usually involve Tang Sanzang being captured and having his life threatened while his disciples try to find an ingenious (and often violent) way of liberating him. Although some of Tang Sanzang&#x27;s predicaments are political and involve ordinary human beings, they more frequently consist of run-ins with various demons, many of whom turn out to be earthly manifestations of heavenly beings (whose sins will be negated by eating the flesh of Tang Sanzang) or animal-spirits with enough Taoist spiritual merit to assume semi-human forms.

Chapters 13–22 do not follow this structure precisely, as they introduce Tang Sanzang&#x27;s disciples, who, inspired or goaded by Guanyin, meet and agree to serve him along the way in order to atone for their sins in their past lives.
* The first is Sun Wukong, or the Monkey King (or just &quot;Monkey&quot;), whose given name loosely means &quot;Monkey Awakened to Emptiness (Śūnyatā)&quot;, trapped under a mountain by the Buddha for defying Heaven. He appears right away in chapter 13. The most intelligent, the most powerful, and the most violent of the disciples, he is constantly reproved for his violence by Tang Sanzang. Ultimately, he can only be controlled by a magic gold ring that Guanyin has placed around his head, which causes him unbearable headaches when Tang Sanzang chants the Ring Tightening Mantra. In the story, Sun Wukong is an allegorical representation of the human mind and thought and impulse, and is often nicknamed the &quot;Monkey mind&quot;. 
* The second, appearing in chapter 19, is Zhu Wuneng / Zhu Bajie, literally &quot;Pig Awakened to Ability&quot; and &quot;Eight Precepts Pig,&quot; sometimes translated as Pigsy or just Pig. He was previously the Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy, a commander of Heaven&#x27;s naval forces, and was banished to the mortal realm for harassing the moon goddess Chang&#x27;e. A reliable fighter, he is characterized by his insatiable appetites for food and women, and is constantly looking for a way out of his duties, which causes significant conflict with Sun Wukong. In the story, Zhu Bajie is an allegorical representation of base human nature (or the Id). 
* The third, appearing in chapter 22, is the river ogre Sha Wujing (literally &quot;Sand Awakened to Purity&quot;), also known as Friar Sand or Sandy. He was previously the celestial Curtain Lifting General, and was banished to the mortal realm for dropping (and shattering) a crystal goblet of the Queen Mother of the West. He is a quiet but generally dependable and hard-working character, who serves as the straight foil to the comic relief of Sun and Zhu. In the story, Sha Wujing is an allegorical representation of human obedience and conformity without thought.
* The fourth is Bai Long Ma (literally &quot;White Dragon Horse&quot;), the third son of the Dragon King of the West Sea, who was sentenced to death for setting fire to his father&#x27;s great pearl. He was saved by Guanyin from execution to stay and wait for his call of duty. He has almost no speaking role, as throughout the story he mainly appears as a horse that Tang Sanzang rides on. In the story, the White Dragon Horse is an allegorical representation of the human will.

Chapter 22, where Sha Wujing is introduced, also provides a geographical boundary, as the river that the travelers cross brings them into a new &quot;continent.&quot; Chapters 23–86 take place in the wilderness, and consist of 24 episodes of varying length, each characterized by a different magical monster or evil magician. There are impassibly wide rivers, flaming mountains, a kingdom with an all-female population, a lair of seductive spider spirits, and many other scenarios. Throughout the journey, the four disciples have to fend off attacks on their master and teacher Tang Sanzang from various monsters and calamities.

It is strongly suggested that most of these calamities are engineered by fate and/or the Buddha, as, while the monsters who attack are vast in power and many in number, no real harm ever comes to the four travelers. Some of the monsters turn out to be escaped celestial beasts belonging to bodhisattvas or Taoist sages and deities. Towards the end of the book, there is a scene where the Buddha commands the fulfillment of the last disaster, because Tang Sanzang is one short of the 81 tribulations required before attaining Buddhahood.

In chapter 87, Tang Sanzang finally reaches the borderlands of India, and chapters 87–99 present magical adventures in a somewhat more mundane setting. At length, after a pilgrimage said to have taken fourteen years (the text actually only provides evidence for nine of those years, but presumably there was room to add additional episodes) they arrive at the half-real, half-legendary destination of Vulture Peak, where, in a scene simultaneously mystical and comic, Tang Sanzang receives the scriptures from the living Buddha.

===Fourth part===
Chapter 100, the final chapter, quickly describes the return journey to the Tang Empire, and the aftermath in which each traveller receives a reward in the form of posts in the bureaucracy of the heavens. Sun Wukong and Tang Sanzang both achieve Buddhahood, Sha Wujing becomes an arhat, Bai Long Ma is made a nāga and Zhu Bajie, whose good deeds have always been tempered by his greed, is promoted to an altar cleanser (i.e. eater of excess offerings at altars).

==Characters==
===Sun Wukong / Monkey King===

Sun Wukong () (pinyin: sūnwùkōng) is the name given to this character by his teacher, Subhuti, the latter part of which means &quot;Awakened to Emptiness&quot; (in the Waley translation, &quot;Aware-of-Vacuity&quot;); he is often called the &quot;Monkey King&quot;. He is born on Flower Fruit Mountain from a stone egg that forms from an ancient rock created by the coupling of Heaven and Earth. He first distinguishes himself by bravely entering the Water Curtain Cave on the mountain; for this feat, his monkey tribe gives him the title of &quot;Handsome Monkey King (美猴王, měi hóuwáng).&quot; After seeing a fellow monkey die because of old age, he decides to travel around the world to seek the Tao, and find a way to be able to live forever. He eventually found the &quot;Grand Master of Bodhi (菩提祖師, pútí zǔshī),&quot; who taught him the 72 heavenly methods of transformation and a &quot;somersault cloud&quot; which allows him to travel 108,000 li almost instantaneously. After angering several gods and coming to the attention of the Jade Emperor, he is given a minor position in heaven as the Keeper of Horses (弼馬溫, bìmǎwēn) so they can keep an eye on him. When Sun realizes that he was given the lowest position in heaven and is not considered a full-fledged god, he becomes very angry. Upon returning to his mountain, he puts up a flag and declares himself the &quot;Great Sage Equal to Heaven (齊天大聖, qí tiān dàshèng).&quot; The Jade Emperor dispatches celestial soldiers to arrest Sun Wukong, but none succeed. The Jade Emperor has no choice but to appoint him to be the guardian of the heavenly peach garden. The different varieties of peach trees in the garden bear fruit every 3,000, 6,000, and 9,000 years, and eating their flesh will bestow immortality and other gifts, so Sun Wukong eats nearly all of the ripe peaches. Later, after fairies who come to collect peaches for Xi Wangmu&#x27;s heavenly peach banquet inform Sun Wukong he is not invited and make fun of him, he once again begins to cause trouble in Heaven, stealing heavenly wine from the peach banquet and eating Laozi&#x27;s pills of immortality. He defeats an army of 100,000 celestial troops, led by the Four Heavenly Kings, Erlang Shen, and Nezha. Eventually, the Jade Emperor appeals to the Buddha, who seals Wukong under a mountain called Five Elements Mountain after the latter loses a bet regarding whether he can leap out of the Buddha&#x27;s hand in a single somersault. Sun Wukong is kept under the mountain for 500 years and cannot escape because of a seal that was placed on the mountain. He is later set free when Tang Sanzang comes upon him during his pilgrimage and accepts him as a disciple.

His primary weapon is his staff, the &quot;Ruyi Jingu Bang,&quot; which he can shrink down to the size of a needle and keep in his ear, as well as expand it to gigantic proportions. The rod, which weighs , was originally a pillar supporting the undersea palace of the Dragon King of the East Sea, but he was able to pull it out of its support and can swing it with ease. The Dragon King had told Sun Wukong he could have the staff if he could lift it, but was angry when the monkey was actually able to pull it out and accused him of being a thief. Sun Wukong was insulted, so he demanded a suit of armor and refused to leave until he received one. The Dragon King of the East and the other dragon kings, fearful of Sun wreaking havoc in their domain, gave him a suit of golden armor. These gifts, combined with his devouring of the peaches of immortality, erasing his name from the Book of the Dead, drinking heavenly wine from the Peach Festival, eating Laozi&#x27;s pills of immortality, and being tempered in Laozi&#x27;s Eight-Trigram Furnace (after which he gained a steel-hard body and fiery golden eyes that could see far into the distance and through any disguise), makes Sun Wukong by far the strongest member of the pilgrimage. Besides these abilities, he can also pluck hairs from his body and blow on them to convert them into whatever he wishes (usually clones of himself to gain a numerical advantage in battle). Furthermore, he is a master of the 72 methods of transformation (), and can transform into anything that exists (animate and inanimate). Notably, however, Sun cannot fight as well underwater, and often the pilgrimage must rely on Pigsy and Sandy for marine combat. The monkey, nimble and quick-witted, uses these skills to defeat all but the most powerful of demons on the journey.

Sun&#x27;s behavior is checked by a band placed around his head by Guanyin, which cannot be removed by Sun Wukong himself until the journey&#x27;s end. Tang Sanzang can tighten this band by chanting the &quot;Ring Tightening Mantra&quot; (taught to him by Guanyin) whenever he needs to chastise him. The spell is referred to by Tang Sanzang&#x27;s disciples as the &quot;Headache Sutra&quot;. Tang Sanzang speaks this mantra quickly in repetition when Sun disobeys him.

Sun Wukong&#x27;s childlike playfulness and often goofy impulsiveness is in contrast to his cunning mind. This, coupled with his great power, makes him a trickster hero. His antics present a lighter side in the long and dangerous trip into the unknown.

After completion of the journey, Sun is granted the title of Victorious Fighting Buddha () and ascends to Buddhahood.

===Tang Sanzang / Tripitaka===

The monk Tang Sanzang (, meaning &quot;Tripitaka Master of Tang,&quot; with &quot;Tang&quot; referring to the Tang dynasty and &quot;Sanzang&quot; referring to the Tripiṭaka, the main categories of texts in the Buddhist canon which is also used as an honorific for some Buddhist monks) is a Buddhist monk who had renounced his family to become a monk from childhood. He is just called &quot;Tripitaka&quot; in many English versions of the story. He set off for Tianzhu Kingdom (, an appellation for India in ancient China) to retrieve original Buddhist scriptures for China. Although he is helpless in defending himself, the bodhisattva Guanyin, helps by finding him powerful disciples who aid and protect him on his journey. In return, the disciples will receive enlightenment and forgiveness for their sins once the journey is done. Along the way, they help the local inhabitants by defeating various monsters and demons who try to obtain immortality by consuming Tang Sanzang&#x27;s flesh.

===Zhu Bajie / Pigsy===

Zhu Bajie (, literally &quot;Pig of the Eight Prohibitions&quot;) is also known as Zhu Wuneng (&quot;Pig Awakened to Power&quot;), and given the name &quot;Monk Pig&quot;, &quot;Piggy&quot;, &quot;Pigsy&quot;, or just simply &quot;Pig&quot; in English.

Once an immortal who was the Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy commanding 100,000 naval soldiers of the Milky Way, he drank too much during a celebration of the gods and attempted to harass the moon goddess Chang&#x27;e, resulting in his banishment to the mortal world. He was supposed to be reborn as a human but ended up in the womb of a sow due to an error on the Reincarnation Wheel, which turned him into a half-man, half-pig humanoid-pig monster. Zhu Bajie was very greedy, and could not survive without eating ravenously. Staying within the &quot;Yunzhan Dong&quot; (&quot;cloud-pathway cave&quot;), he was commissioned by Guanyin to accompany Tang Sanzang to India and given the new name Zhu Wuneng.

However, Zhu Bajie&#x27;s lust for women led him to the Gao Family Village, where he posed as a handsome young man and helped defeat a group of robbers who tried to abduct a maiden. Eventually, the family agreed to let Zhu Bajie marry the maiden. But during the day of the wedding, he drank too much alcohol and accidentally returned to his original form. Being extremely shocked, the villagers ran away, but Zhu Bajie wanted to keep his bride, so he told the bride&#x27;s father that if after one month the family still did not agree to let him keep the bride, he would take her by force. He also locked the bride up in a separate building. At this point, Tang Sanzang and Sun Wukong arrived at the Gao Family Village and helped defeat him. Renamed Zhu Bajie by Tang Sanzang, he consequently joined the pilgrimage to the West.

His weapon of choice is the &quot;jiuchidingpa&quot; (&quot;nine-tooth iron rake&quot;). He is also capable of 36 transformations and can travel on clouds, but not as fast as Sun Wukong. However, Zhu is noted for his fighting skills in the water, which he used to combat Sha Wujing, who later joined them on the journey. He is the second strongest member of the team.

Pigsy&#x27;s lust for women, extreme laziness, and greediness, made his spirituality the lowest in the group, with even the White Dragon Horse achieving more than him, and he remained on Earth and was granted the title &quot;Cleaner of the Altars,&quot; with the duty of cleaning every altar at every Buddhist temple for eternity by eating excess offerings.

===Sha Wujing / Sandy===

Sha Wujing (, &quot;Sand Awakened to Purity&quot;), given the name &quot;Friar Sand&quot;, &quot;Sand Monk&quot;, &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;Sand Fairy&quot;, &quot;Sand Orc&quot;, &quot;Sand Ogre&quot;, &quot;Sand Troll&quot;, &quot;Sand Oni&quot;, &quot;Sand Demon&quot;, &quot;Sand Monster&quot;, &quot;Sand Hulk&quot;, &quot;Sand&quot;, or &quot;Sandy&quot; in English, was once a celestial Curtain Lifting General, who stood in attendance by the imperial chariot in the Hall of Miraculous Mist. He was exiled to the mortal world and made to look like a sandman, orc, ogre, troll, oni, demon, monster, or hulk because he accidentally smashed a crystal goblet belonging to the Queen Mother of the West during a Peach Banquet. The now-hideous immortal took up residence in the Flowing Sands River, terrorizing surrounding villages and travelers trying to cross the river. However, he was subdued by Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie when Tang Sanzang&#x27;s party came across him. They consequently took him in, as part of the pilgrimage to the West.

Sha Wujing&#x27;s weapon is a magic wooden staff wrapped in pearly threads, although artwork and adaptations depict him with a Monk&#x27;s spade staff. He also knows 18 transformation methods and is highly effective in water combat. He is known to be the most obedient, logical, and polite of the three disciples, and always takes care of his master, seldom engaging in the bickering of his fellow disciples. He has no major faults nor any extraordinary characteristics. Due to this, he is sometimes seen as a minor character. He does however serve as the peacekeeper of the group, mediating between Wukong, Bajie, and even Tang Sanzang and others. He is also the person whom Tang Sanzang consults when faced with difficult decisions.

He eventually becomes an arhat at the end of the journey, giving him a higher level of exaltation than Zhu Bajie, who is relegated to cleaning altars, but lower spiritually than Sun Wukong and Tang Sanzang, who are granted Buddhahood.

==Sequels==
The brief satirical novel &quot;Xiyoubu&quot; (, &quot;A Supplement to the Journey to the West,&quot; ) follows Sun Wukong as he is trapped in a magical dream world created by the Qing Fish Demon, the embodiment of desire (, qing). Sun travels back and forth through time, during which he serves as the adjunct King of Hell and judges the soul of the recently dead traitor Qin Hui during the Song dynasty, takes on the appearance of a beautiful concubine and causes the downfall of the Qin dynasty, and even faces Pāramitā, one of his five sons born to the rakshasa Princess Iron Fan, on the battlefield during the Tang dynasty. The events of &quot;Xiyoubu&quot; take place between the end of chapter 61 and the beginning of chapter 62 of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. The author, Dong Yue (), wrote the book because he wanted to create an opponent—in this case desire—that Sun could not defeat with his great strength and martial skill.

==Notable English-language translations==
===Abridged===
* &quot;Monkey: A Folk-Tale of China&quot; (1942), an abridged translation by Arthur Waley. For many years, this was the most well-known translation available in English. The Waley translation has also been published as &quot;Adventures of the Monkey God&quot;, &quot;Monkey to the West&quot;, &quot;Monkey: Folk Novel of China&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Monkey&quot;, and in a further abridged version for children, &quot;Dear Monkey&quot;. Waley noted in his preface that the method adopted in earlier abridgements was &quot;to leave the original number of separate episodes, but drastically reduce them in length, particularly by cutting out dialogue. I have for the most part adopted the opposite principle, omitting many episodes, but translating those that are retained almost in full, leaving out, however, most of the incidental passages in verse, which go very badly into English.&quot; The degree of abridgement, 30 out of the 100 chapters (which corresponds to roughly 1/6 of the whole text), and excising most of the verse, has led to a recent critic awarding it the lesser place, as a good &quot;retelling&quot; of the story. On the other hand, it has been praised as &quot;remarkably faithful to the original spirit of the work.&quot;
: The literary scholar Andrew H. Plaks points out that Waley&#x27;s abridgement reflected his interpretation of the novel as a &quot;folktale&quot;; this &quot;brilliant translation... through its selection of episodes gave rise to the misleading impression that that this is essentially a compendium of popular materials marked by folk wit and humour.&quot; Waley followed Hu Shi&#x27;s lead, as shown in Hu&#x27;s introduction to the 1943 edition. Hu scorned the allegorical interpretations of the novel as a spiritual as well as physical quest, declaring that they were old-fashioned. He instead insisted that the stories were simply comic. Hu Shi reacted against elaborately allegorical readings of the novel made popular in the Qing dynasty, but does not account for the levels of meaning and the looser allegorical framework which recent scholars in China and the West have shown.

Yu, the first to translate the poems and songs which Yu argues are essential in understanding the author&#x27;s meanings. Yu also supplied an extensive scholarly introduction and notes. In 2012, University of Chicago Press issued a revised edition of Yu&#x27;s translation in four volumes. In addition to correcting or amending the translation and converting romanisation to pinyin, the new edition updates and augments the annotations, and revises and expands the introduction in respect to new scholarship and modes of interpretation.

==Media adaptations==

&quot;Saiyūki (西遊記)&quot;, also known by its English title &quot;Monkey&quot; and commonly referred to by its title song, &quot;Monkey Magic,&quot; is a Japanese television series starring Masaaki Sakai, produced by Nippon TV and International Television Films in association with NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) and broadcast from 1978 to 1980 on Nippon TV. It was translated into English by the BBC.

In the 1980s, China Central Television (CCTV) produced and aired a TV adaptation of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; under the same name as the original work. A second season was produced in the late 1990s covering portions of the original work that the first season skipped over.

In 1988, the Japanese anime series &quot;Doraemon&quot; released a movie named &quot;&quot; which is based on the same story.

In 1997, Brooklyn-based jazz composer Fred Ho premiered his jazz opera &quot;Journey to the East&quot;, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which he developed into what he described as a &quot;serial fantasy action-adventure music/theater epic,&quot; &quot;Journey Beyond the West: The New Adventures of Monkey&quot;. Ho&#x27;s pop-culture infused take on the story of the Monkey King has been performed to great acclaim.

In 1999, the Sony PlayStation game &quot;&quot; was released, which follows the general plot of the story.

A video game adaptation titled &quot;&quot; was released in October 2010 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. It was developed by Ninja Theory and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The voice and motion capture for the main protagonist, &#x27;Monkey&#x27;, were provided by Andy Serkis.

On 20 April 2017, Australia&#x27;s ABC, TVNZ, and Netflix announced production was underway in New Zealand on a new live-action television series, &quot;The New Legends of Monkey&quot;, to premiere globally in 2018. The series, which is based on &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, is made up of 10 half-hour episodes. While there has been enthusiasm for the new series, it has also attracted some criticism for &quot;whitewashing,&quot; since none of the core cast are of Chinese descent, with two of the leads having Tongan ancestry while only one, Chai Hansen, is of half-Asian (his father is Thai) descent.

More recently in 2017, Viki and Netflix hosted a South Korean show called &quot;A Korean Odyssey&quot;; a modern comedy retelling that begins with the release of Sun Wukong/Son O-Gong and the reincarnation of Tang Sanzang/Samjang.

In August 2020, Game Science Studios announced a video game called &quot;Black Myth: Wukong&quot;. It was released on 20 August 2024 for PlayStation 5 and PC. It is also slated to release at a later date for the Xbox Series X/S. The plot of the game is set after the main events of the novel.

On May 16, 2020, The Lego Group released the theme, Lego Monkie Kid, to which Journey of the West was credited as the main inspiration, featuring many characters from the original work. Four days later on May 20, an animated television series pilot was released to coincide with the theme, and was later picked up for production and released serially starting in September 2020.

<doc id="232372" wikidata="Q1085823" url="?curid=232372" title="Tang Sanzang">
<text>Tang Sanzang is a Buddhist monk and pilgrim who is a central character in the 16th century novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; by Wu Cheng&#x27;en. Tang Sanzang is based on the historical Tang dynasty monk Xuanzang.

Tang Sanzang&#x27;s birth surname name was Chen (), but having been found in a river as a baby—he was abandoned after birth—he was given the name &quot;Jiāng Liú&quot; (; this given name literally meaning &quot;River Float&quot;, a nod to the fact that he was found in a river). When he first became a monk, his Dharma name is &quot;Xuánzàng&quot; (; literally meaning &quot;Great Mystery&quot;). Later, upon swearing brotherhood with the Tang Emperor, he gains the new surname, &quot;Tang&quot; (), and for the pilgrimage, he is called by the new given-name/epithet, &quot;Sānzàng&quot; (, lit. The &quot;Three Baskets&quot;; referring to the &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot;), but is also widely known by his courtesy name Tang Seng (, lit. the &quot;Tang Monk&quot;).

The title &quot;Sānzàng&quot; refers to his mission to seek the &quot;Sanzangjing&quot;, or the &quot;Three Collections of (Buddhist Great vehicle) Scriptures&quot;. In some English translations of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, the title is rendered as [[Tripiṭaka|Tripitaka]] which is the original Sanskrit term for the &quot;Sanzangjing&quot;. His name Tang Sanzang reflects his status as an oath brother of Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty.

==Character description==

The monk&#x27;s title Sanzang refers to his mission to seek the Tripitaka, which is the Sanskrit name for collections of ancient Buddhist scriptures. In most English translations of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, including the authoritative translation by Anthony Yu, his name is rendered as Tripitaka. In the novel, he takes the name Tang after becoming an oath brother of Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty.

Tang Sanzang is a Buddhist monk who is a reincarnation of Golden Cicada (), a disciple of the Buddha. Tang Sanzang&#x27;s original family name was Chen, the posthumous son of Palace Graduate Chen Guangrui and Yin Wenjiao, the daughter of chief minister Yin Kaishen. After being awarded the first place in a national examination, Chen Guangrui was appointed Prefect of Jiangzhou (modern Jiujiang). While on his way to take office, he was murdered by a ferryman named Liu Hong, who also abducts his wife and takes his place as Prefect. When Chen&#x27;s son is born, Yin Wenjiao puts the baby on a wooden board and sets him floating adrift down the Yangzi River, out of fear of him being killed by Liu Hong. The baby reaches Gold Mountain Monastery and is found by the Abbot, who gives him the nickname &quot;Jiāngliú&quot; (, lit. &quot;River Float&quot;). The abbot sees that River Float is taken care of, and when he grows up and becomes a Buddhist novice, he gives him the Dharma name Xuanzang. When Xuanzang turns 18, he is reunited with his father, whose body was saved from death by the Dragon King of River Hong; together they look for Lady Yin and bring Liu Hong to justice.

He is sent by the Emperor Taizong on a mission to Tianzhu (an ancient Chinese name for India) to fetch a set of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures back to China for the purpose of spreading Buddhism in his native land. He becomes sworn brothers with the Emperor of the Tang dynasty, and the emperor sees him off from the capital Chang&#x27;an with two escorts to accompany him. This contrasts with the historical Xuanzang, who disobeyed the Emperor&#x27;s orders against foreign travel and did not have his permission.

Tang Sanzang is helpless at defending himself and his two escorts are killed during his first encounter with demons after his departure from Chang&#x27;an. The bodhisattva Guanyin helps Tang Sanzang find three powerful supernatural beings—Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing (a monkey, pig and fish spirit, respectively)—to aid and protect him on his journey. The three become Tang Sanzang&#x27;s disciples and receive enlightenment and redemption for their past sins once the pilgrimage is complete.

Along the journey, Tang Sanzang is constantly terrorised by monsters and demons due to a legend which says that one can attain immortality by consuming his flesh because he is a reincarnation of a holy being. One of his disciples is caught by a monster, and the other falls into the Tongtian River, also known as the River of Communion with Heaven. On the other hand, there are several attempts on marrying him made by demons such as the Scorpion Demoness and the Golden-Nosed Albino Rat Spirit.

At the end of the novel, Tang Sanzang is appointed as the Buddha of Sandalwood Merit. This is a nod to the fact that, in Buddhism, sandalwood (and, by extension, sandalwood incense) is seen as having the power to distil purity by burning-away negative spiritual impurities; Tang Sanzang, as Golden Cicada, had dismissed the Buddha&#x27;s teachings and-so was sentenced to re-incarnate as a Buddhist ten consecutive times to distil himself spiritually, expelling spiritual impurities until only purity was left, ultimately achieving Buddhahood, making him the &quot;Buddha of Sandalwood Merit&quot;.

==Historical background==
Tang Sanzang is modeled after the historical Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Xuanzang, whose life was the book&#x27;s inspiration; the real Xuanzang made a perilous journey on foot from China to India (and back) to obtain Buddhist sutras.

In contrast to the historical Xuanzang, a wise and learned scholar (he was in his late 20s when he left for India), the fictional Tang Sanzang is presented as a young monk who is extremely naive, showing idealistic compassion without wisdom. Tang Sanzang is usually quick to fall for the facades of demons who have disguised themselves as innocent humans, as he cannot recognize them, whereas Sun Wukong can. This frequently leads to tension when Sun Wukong tries to protect him from such threats. One such popular instance was when the White Bone Demon disguised three times as family members—first, a young woman. After Wukong &quot;killed&quot; the woman, the demon escaped, but Wukong was punished by Tang Sanzang for it. The second was the young woman&#x27;s elderly mother, looking for her daughter. The third was the young woman&#x27;s elderly father, searching for his wife and child. Upon the &quot;death&quot; of the father by Wukong&#x27;s hands, Wukong finally killed the demon before she got away. Tang Sanzang, convinced that Wukong had actually killed three innocent people, sent him away, despite protests. Tang Sanzang usually punishes him by chanting the words of the &quot;Tight-Fillet Spell&quot; () given to Tang Sanzang by the bodhisattva Guanyin to control Wukong, which causes the latter&#x27;s headband to contract and give him acute headaches.

Like Sun Wukong, Tang Sanzang is often described as a god of protection. Ksitigarbha, a highly revered bodhisattva in East Asian Buddhism, is occasionally mistaken for Tang Sanzang because the former is often portrayed like Tang Sanzang - dressed in a similarly patterned kasaya robe, wearing a Buddhist crown (an Ushnisha or a Black Crown), and wielding a khakkhara staff. In some depictions or media sometimes Sanzang is depicted as a female monk or nun but this is mostly in Japan.

<doc id="232381" wikidata="Q1112940" url="?curid=232381" title="Columns (video game)">
<text>is a match-three puzzle video game released by Jay Geertsen in 1989. Originally developed for the Motorola 68000-based HP 9000 running HP-UX, it was ported to Mac and MS-DOS before being released commercially by Sega who ported it to arcades and then to several Sega consoles. The game was subsequently ported to other home computers, including the Atari ST.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Columns&quot; was one of the many tile-matching puzzle games to appear after the great success of &quot;Tetris&quot; in the late 1980s. The game itself is enclosed within a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously fallen &quot;columns&quot;. While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it. After a column lands, if three or more of the same symbols are connected in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this resettlement causes three or more other symbols to align, they too disappear and the cycle repeats. Occasionally, a special column with a multicolor Magic Jewel appears. It destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it. The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with jewels, which ends the game. Players can score up to 99,999,999 points.

Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. &quot;Flash columns&quot; involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. &quot;Doubles&quot; allows two players work together in the same well. &quot;Time trial&quot; involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.

==Ports==
Sega ported the arcade game to the Mega Drive/Genesis console. This version of the game was nearly identical to the original arcade game.

&quot;Columns&quot; was the first pack-in game for the Game Gear. This version was slightly different from the Mega Drive/Genesis version and its soundtrack was transposed and rearranged due to limitations of the handheld&#x27;s sound chip. While the columns themselves were updated for the Mega Drive/Genesis version, the overall decoration was less like a cartoon in the Game Gear version and instead more artistically designed. Lastly, the Game Gear version had a feature that let the player change the jewels to fruit, squares, dice, or playing card suits (clubs, diamonds, spades, and hearts).

In 1990, Compile and Telenet Japan developed and published an MSX2 version.

In November 2006, &quot;Columns&quot; was released as part of the game &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 2, and later on another release of the above compilation for PlayStation Portable. The same year on December 4, title was released on Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console for 800 Wii Points. It is also included on &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was included as one of the games in the Sega Genesis Mini. It was also included as one of the games in the 2018 releases of Sega Genesis Classics for Windows, Linux, macOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Most recently the game was ported to iOS by Sega, but the port was subsequently withdrawn by Sega. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in December 2022.

==Music==
Tokuhiko Uwabo composed the music for &quot;Columns&quot;. The tracks &quot;Clotho&quot;, &quot;Atropos&quot; and &quot;Lathesis&quot; are named after the Moirai from Greek mythology.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Columns&quot; on their April 15, 1990 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the month. It went on to be Japan&#x27;s fourth highest-grossing arcade game of 1990 (below Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Final Fight&quot; and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot;) and third highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1991 (below Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Tetris&quot;).

Reviewing the game&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Sega Arcade Classics&quot; for the Sega CD, Glenn Rubenstein gave it a B+ rating in &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine, describing it as &quot;like &quot;Tetris&quot; but a bit better&quot;. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at number 34 in their &quot;Top Mega Drive Games of All Time&quot;. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked the game 40th on its &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time&quot;.

==Legacy==
Many sequels and spin-offs were produced: &quot;Columns II: The Voyage Through Time&quot;, &quot;Columns III: Revenge of Columns&quot;, &quot;Columns &#x27;97&quot;, &quot;Sakura Taisen: Hanagumi Taisen Columns 1 &amp; 2&quot;, and many compilations and re-releases (&quot;Columns Arcade Collection&quot;, &quot;Sega Ages Vol. 07: Columns&quot;) as well. Because &quot;Columns&quot; was made by Sega, versions were made available on the Master System, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega CD, Game Gear, Saturn, and Dreamcast. Additional versions of the game have also been made available on PC-Engine, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation 2. A Super Famicom version was released in Japan via the Nintendo Power service. The Game Boy Color version was specifically called &quot;Columns GB: Osamu Tezuka Characters&quot;, where it featured many of his characters such as Kimba and Astroboy, but also featured slightly less known characters such as Unico.

&quot;Columns&quot; has also been cloned many times across different platforms:

<text>Cheongsam (, ) or zansae, also known as the qipao () and sometimes referred to as the mandarin gown, is a Chinese dress worn by women which takes inspiration from the , the ethnic clothing of the Manchu people. The cheongsam is most often seen as a longer, figure-fitting, one piece garment with a standing collar, an asymmetric, left-over-right () opening and two side slits, and embellished with Chinese frog fasteners on the lapel and the collar. It was developed in the 1920s and evolved in shapes and design over years. It was popular in China from the 1920s to 1960s, overlapping with the Republican era, and was popularized by Chinese socialites and high society women in Shanghai. Although the cheongsam is sometimes seen as traditional Chinese clothing, it continues to evolve with the times, responding to changes in contemporary modern life.

== Terminology ==
As English loanwords, both &quot;&quot;cheongsam&quot; and &quot;qipao&quot;&quot; describe the same type of body-hugging dress worn by Chinese women, and the words could be used interchangeably.

The term &quot;cheongsam&quot; is a romanization of Cantonese word &#x27; (), which comes from the Shanghainese term &#x27;. In Cantonese and Shanghainese, the term is used to describe a Chinese dress popularized in Shanghai. However, in Mandarin Chinese and other varieties of Chinese, () refers to an exclusively male garment, and the female version is known as the . In Hong Kong, where many Shanghainese tailors fled after the communist revolution of 1949, the word &quot;&quot; became gender-neutral, referring to both male and female garments.

The word &quot;qipao&quot; (), which literally means &quot;Bannerman robe&quot; and originally referred to a loose-fitting, trapezoidal-cut garment worn by both Manchu men and women, became a more formal term for the female . Usage of the term &quot;cheongsam&quot; in Western countries mostly followed the original Cantonese meaning and applies to the dress worn by women only.

== Design and construction ==

The design of the cheongsam has evolved with time; and there are now a various styles of cheongsam. However, after decades of development, the design of cheongsam itself can be roughly categorized into the Beijing style, the Shanghai style, and the Hong Kong style.

=== General characteristics and features ===
The cheongsam is typically a tight-fitting dress, with a pair of high side slits above the knee-level. The length of the cheongsam can vary; it can be either long or short. It is more often seen with short sleeves; however, it can also be sleeveless.

==== Collars and neckline ====

It is typically found with the mandarin collar and has asymmetric closure which runs from the central collar across the top area of the chest to the armhole curing down to the right side. In Chinese clothing culture, the overlap on the right side is known as . However, the cheongsam is not limited to the asymmetrical closure; there are various styles of cheongsam necklines, including a symmetrical opening in the chest area.

==== Fasteners and closures ====
The fasteners uses traditional Chinese knotting craftwork with the use of the fastening and Chinese button knot.

==== Edges and piping ====
The cheongsam is typically edged with piping, especially at the collar and the closure. There are four traditional piping techniques used in the making of the cheongsam: () which is a narrow strips of fabric roll around the raw edge of the garment and is the most commonly used nowadays, () which is broad edging typically found in Manchu clothing of the Qing dynasty and the early cheongsam and is now quite rare, () is a very narrow strip of fabric which is even narrower than the , and () is a specific type of technique which uses a narrow strip of fabric which is stitched on the dress.

It is also typical for the and the to be used together on the same dress creating a double-edged look; this technique is known as (). Other double-edged piping technique include “two--one-” and the “two--two-”. The can also be combined with the ; in this combination, the and the would be made of the same width and colour of fabric but they would run parallel to each other about two to five centimeters away from each other.

==== Fabric and textile ====

Different materials can be used in the making of the cheongsam, such as wool, silk (including silk floss, damask, brocade, satin), or silk-like materials. The cheongsam can also be unlined or interlined. The fabric of the cheongsam can decorated with a diversity of decorative motifs, which can be embroidered on the dress.

=== Main styles ===

The Beijing-style cheongsam originated in Beijing and is fairly traditional and conservative. It is typically handmade. It maintains the traditional straight and A-line silhouette, and often has embroidery and elaborate adornments. It is also characterized by its wide piping. The Beijing-style cheongsam expresses Chinese culture in its style. The production of a Beijing cheongsam is complex. The fasteners can sometimes take several days to create, typically requiring twenty-six procedures of silk processing to be turning into silk strips which would be appropriate in the making of the fasteners of various patterns by artisans.

The Shanghai-style Cheongsam originated in Shanghai and is a popular and dominant style. The Shanghai-style Cheongsam, especially, conveyed progressive messages of female body emancipation from the 1930s to 1940s; it also came to symbolize the idea of modernity in &quot;pursuing health, fashion, and natural beauty&quot;. As a result, to deliberately create a more figure-hugging silhouette and to focus on showing off the natural curve of the female body, many elements of Western tailoring techniques can be found in the Shanghai-style cheongsam, including curved cutting, waist darts. This act of showing the female body was a physical expression of the changes in the identities of Chinese women and their rebellion against the idealized womanhood as indicated in the Confucian ideology. It also features high side slits and high collar. The collars can be lapel collars, water drop collars, and lotus leaf collars; the shape of the sleeves are also diverse. It also uses lighter materials and has less elaborate embroidery or adornments; the piping is very narrow.

The Jiangnan-style cheongsam, also known as Su-style cheongsam, originated in the Jiangnan Water town. This style of cheongsam expresses the cultural characteristics of the water town in Jiangnan and also creates a fusion between Chinese calligraphy and Chinese painting, incorporating the hand-painting art of the Wumen School of Painting. It is characterized by the neckline and embroidered patterns on the edges of the cuff. The dress is also embroidered with rich pattern motifs which tend to be floral, e.g. plum, orchid, bamboo, chrysanthemum, peonies, and roses. The fabrics used tend to be high-quality soft satin and plain crepe satin, etc.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The Manchu are an ethnic minority that founded the last of China&#x27;s imperial dynasties, the Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 to 1911. When the dynasty was first established, dress regulations were implemented as a way of expressing their identity as a people and creating social order. They used an administrative division called the Eight Banner system. Originally only the Manchu households were organized within this system, but over time naturalized Mongols and Han Chinese were incorporated. The Manchu, and anyone living under the Eight Banners system, wore different clothing from ordinary civilians. Thus, they became known as the &quot;Banner People&quot; ().

The type of that both men and women typically wore consisted of long robes, which can be referred to as the Manchu and also categorized under the broad category of () or ().

Manchu men wore a , which were designed for horseback riding, known as , which was characterized by two pair of slits (one slit on each side, one slit on the back, and one slit on the front) which increased ease of movement when mounting and dismounting horses, a collar (a collar which curved like the alphabet《S》), and the sleeve cuffs known as ().
On the other hand, some imperial Manchu women wore a (), informal dress, which looked similar to the men&#x27;s known as the (). There were also two styles of for the imperial consorts, known as and , which became popular. The and the differed in terms of structure: the had two high side slits which allowed for greater ease of movements while the had no side slits. Both the and differed from the lacking the cuffs. Both the and were also the of the Manchu women; they also both became popular during the reign of Emperor Qianlong. It is also theorized that the cheongsam was derived from the Manchu women&#x27;s although the shows the absence of slits.

=== Introduction of Manchu-style clothing ===

Throughout China&#x27;s multicultural history, clothing has been shaped through an intermingling of primarily Han clothing styles, the Han Chinese being the dominant ethnicity, and the styles of various ethnic groups. Some examples include the standing collar of the cheongsam, which has been found in relics from the Ming dynasty, ruled by the Han Chinese, and was subsequently adopted in the Qing dynasty as Manchu clothing items. Manchu robes were initially collarless. The Manchu also adopted the right closure from the Han Chinese as they initially closed their robes on the left side.
Under the dynastic laws of transition from Ming to Qing, all Han Chinese were forced to adopt the Manchu male queue hairstyle and adopt Manchu clothing under the () policy instead of being found wearing the traditional , under the threat of death penalty. However, the order for ordinary non-Banner Han civilians to wear Manchu clothing was lifted, and only those Han who served as officials or scholars were required to wear them. Over time though, some Han civilian men voluntarily adopted the changshan. By the late Qing, not only officials and scholars, but a great many Han commoners wore Manchu-style male attire. However, until 1911, the Manchu &quot;changpao&quot; was required clothing for Chinese men of a certain class.

What is now known as the Chinese changshan was developed by the Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty. Han Chinese started to wear the Qing dynasty Chinese changshan after the Manchu conquest; the Chinese changshan was a modified version of the daopao or zhiduo worn in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD), the dynasty preceding the Qing dynasty. The Qing dynasty Chinese changshan was modeled after the Manchu&#x27;s men&#x27;s robe. It thus adopted certain Manchu elements, such as slimming their changshan, adopting the collar of the Manchu, and using buttons and loops at the neck and sides. The Chinese changshan differed from the Manchu men&#x27;s neitao as it only had two slits on the sides, lacking the central front and back slits, and lacked the presence of the cuffs; the sleeves were also longer than the ones found in the neitao.

For women, Manchu and Han systems of clothing coexisted. Throughout the Qing dynasty, Han civilian women could wear traditional Han clothing from the Ming dynasty. As a result, Ming dynasty style clothing was preserved to an extent in China until the Xinhai Revolution of 1911.

=== Birth of the cheongsam ===
In the late 1910s, after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China, women began to partake in the education system. They wore an early form of the cheongsam, which quickly became the regular outfit of urban women in metropolitan cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Cheongsam of the late 1910s and early 1920s had relatively loose cutting with long, wide sleeves. One of the earliest cheongsams was A-line with wide three-quarter sleeves and would fall just below the knee level.

Under the Western influences of wearing shorter dresses in 1928, the length of the cheongsam became shorter. In 1929, the cheongsam was chosen by the Republic of China government to be one of the country&#x27;s national dresses. With the designation of &quot;national dress&quot;, the Republic of China government also promulgated the new &quot;Clothing Regulations of 1929&quot;, which specified the cheongsam should be worn with trousers and be calf-length. However, even before the &quot;Clothing Regulations of 1929&quot;, women had already stopped wearing trousers in favor of silk stockings. Chinese women held no respect to the rule, as it was seen as an attempt by the Republican government to control individual rights and woman&#x27;s liberty.

From the 1920s onwards, the cheongsam was quickly popularized by celebrities, socialites, and politicians in Shanghai. Former First Lady of China Madame Wellington Koo (Oei Hui-lan) was a prominent figure among them. Voted several times by &quot;Vogue&quot; into its lists of the world&#x27;s best-dressed women, Madame Wellington Koo was much admired for her adaptations of the traditional Manchu fashion, which she wore with lace trousers and jade necklaces. Cheongsam dresses at the time had been decorously slit a few inches up the sides, but Madame Koo slashed hers to the knee, &#x27;with lace pantelettes just visible to the ankle&#x27;. Unlike other Asian socialites, Madame Koo also insisted on local Chinese silks, which she thought were of superior quality.

=== Further transformation ===

Starting from the early 1930s, there was a further transformation of the qipao as it became increasingly shorter, tighter, and body-hugging, with side slits that reached up to the thigh. Moreover, numerous distinct cheongsams designs emerged, with experimental changes on fastenings, pipings, collars, fur-lined cuffs, various length of sleeves, or simply sleeveless.

Consumer culture rose as Western and Chinese merchants cooperated to move towards early capitalism. People eagerly sought a more modernized dress style and transformed the old cheongsam to suit new tastes. Newer forms featured slender and tight-fitting pencil cuts and deep necks, which is different from the early cheongsam. High-class courtesans and celebrities in the city welcomed the tight-fitting cheongsam. It was at this time the word cheongsam became well known in English. In Shanghainese, it was first known as for &#x27;long dress&#x27;, rendered in Mandarin as and in Cantonese as . Then, the spoken Cantonese renditions of was borrowed into English as &quot;cheongsam&quot;.

Trousers had completely fallen out of use, replaced by different types of hosiery. High-heeled shoes were popularized in the Shanghai fashion scene in the 1930s. Stockings and High-heeled shoes became an essential part of the cheongsam fashion set, which spawned new side slits designs reaching the hip line, intended to display the hosiery and heels. As Western fashions evolved, so did the cheongsam design, introducing high-necked sleeveless dresses, bell-like sleeves, and the black lace frothing at the hem of a ball gown. By the 1940s, cheongsam came in a wide variety of fabrics with an equal variety of accessories.

=== In late 20th century ===
Cheongsams were worn by celebrities, societies, and students of prestigious missionary schools in the early 20th century. As a result, the cheongsam-style uniform was regarded as an icon of the wealthy class and was perceived as Bourgeois by the Communist China. From the 1950s to the 1970s, with the destroying Four Olds movements and the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), China pushed for egalitarian ideology and wearing cheongsam could result in punishment. For example, in 1963, when Chinese President Liu Shaoqi visited four neighbouring countries in South Asia, the first lady Wang Guangmei wore a cheongsam. She was later declared guilty in the Cultural Revolution for wearing it, due to its historical ties and symbolism. 

In other Chinese communities, such as Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong, the cheongsam remained popular after the war. It became everyday wear in the British colony of Hong Kong in the 1950s, and leather clutch, high heels, and white gloves were common pairing accessories. However, the popularity ultimately declined in the 1970s, giving way for cheaper and mass-produced Western-style clothing.

Since the 1980s, with the trend of reevaluation of Chinese traditional culture, people in mainland China started to pay attention to the cheongsam again. The cheongsam is gaining popularity in films, beauty pageants, and fashion shows in both China and other countries all over the world. In 1984, the cheongsam was specified as the formal attire of female diplomatic agents by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
== Modern use ==
=== Workplace ===

Some airlines in Mainland China and Taiwan, such as China Airlines and Hainan Airlines, have cheongsam uniforms for their women flight attendants and ground workers. These uniform cheongsams are in a plain color, hemmed just above the knee, with a close-fitting wool suit jacket of the same color as the cheongsam. It is also common for these uniforms to only borrow certain elements, such as the standing collar and frog clasps, without adopting the whole design. In the 1950s, women in the workforce in Hong Kong started to wear more functional cheongsam made of wool, twill, and other materials. Most were tailor fitted and often came with a matching jacket. The dresses were a fusion of Chinese tradition with modern styles. Cheongsam was commonly replaced by more comfortable clothing such as sweaters, jeans, business suits, and skirts. Due to its restrictive nature, it is now mainly worn as formal wear for important occasions. They are sometimes worn by politicians and film artists in Taiwan and Hong Kong. They are shown in some Chinese movies, such as in the 1960s film &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;, where actress Nancy Kwan made the cheongsam briefly fashionable in Western culture. They are also commonly seen in beauty contests, along with swimsuits. Today, cheongsam is only commonly worn day to day as a uniform by people like restaurant hostesses and serving staff at luxury hotels.

=== School uniform ===

Before World War II, it was customary for girl students who attended schools run by Western missionaries societies to wear cheongsam as their school uniforms; on the other hand, there were very few indigenous Chinese schools that were using the cheongsam as a school uniform.

A few primary schools and some secondary schools in Hong Kong, especially older schools established by Christian missionaries, use a plain-rimmed sky-blue cotton and/or dark blue velvet (for winter) cheongsam with the metal school badge right under the stand-up collar to be closed with a metal hook and eye as the official uniform for their female students. The schools which use this standard include True Light Girls&#x27; College, St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College, Heep Yunn School, St. Stephen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; College, Ying Wa Girls&#x27; School, etc. These cheongsams are usually straight, with no waist shaping, and the cheongsam hem must reach mid-thigh. The cheongsam fit closely to the neck, and the stiff collar is hooked closed, despite the tropical humid and hot weather. Although the skirts have short slits, they are too narrow to allow students to walk in long strides. The seams above the slits often split when walking and are repeatedly sewn. Many schools also require underskirts to be worn with the cheongsam. The underskirt is a white cotton full slip, hemmed slightly shorter than the cheongsam, and has slits at the sides like the cheongsam, although the slits are deeper. A white cotton undershirt is often worn underneath the cheongsam. The cheongsam&#x27;s length, styling, color, and sleeve length vary between schools. Many students feel it is an ordeal, yet it is a visible manifestation of the strict discipline that is the hallmark of prestigious secondary schools in Hong Kong, and many students and their parents like that. Some rebellious students express dissatisfaction with this tradition by wearing their uniform with the stand-up collar intentionally left unhooked or hemmed above their knees. The Ying Wa and True Light Schools have sent questionnaires to their students about uniform reforms but have not altered their policies. However, Madam Lau Kam Lung Secondary School of Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery ended their cheongsam uniform in 1990 after receiving suggestions from its student union.

=== Festivities ===

Cheongsams are a popular outfit choice for festive seasons like Chinese New Year. In countries with significant Chinese populations, such as Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, it is common for women to have new cheongsams tailored in preparation for the New Year. Cheongsams are also popular outfits for older women on formal occasions or family reunions. Upmarket fashion labels such as Shanghai Tang specialize in modern versions of the cheongsam as occasion wear.

=== Weddings ===
In Western weddings, Chinese brides or brides marrying into a Chinese family will often wear cheongsam for a portion of the wedding day. It is common for many brides to have both a traditional white wedding dress and a cheongsam or a guaqun (another kind of wedding attire) to be worn during the tea ceremony. Cheongsam styles have also evolved to be more modern, from mermaid silhouettes to semi-traditional styles that feature a cheongsam top with softer details like lace and a looser skirt.

=== Lolita fashion ===

Some Lolita dresses are styled like cheongsam. The dresses or jumper skirts are designed after traditional Chinese dresses. This style of Lolita fashion is called &quot;Qi Lolita&quot;.

== On the international stage ==
=== Sport-related ===

In the 2008 Summer Olympics, the medal bearers wore cheongsam. Similar attire was worn by female members of the Swedish team and of the Spanish team in the opening ceremony, with the national colors.

For the 2012 Hong Kong Sevens tournament, sportswear brand Kukri Sports teamed up with Hong Kong lifestyle retail store G.O.D. to produce merchandising, which included traditional Chinese jackets and cheongsam-inspired ladies&#x27; polo shirts.

=== Political stage ===

In contemporary China, the meaning of cheongsam has been revisited again. It now embodies an identity of being ethnic Chinese and thus is used for important diplomatic occasions.

Since 2013, Peng Liyuan, the first lady of China, has worn cheongsam several times while on foreign visits with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

In November 2014, cheongsam was the official attire for the political leaders&#x27; wives in the 22nd APEC meeting in Beijing.

=== International fashion ===

With the growth of the Chinese economy, cheongsam has experienced a renewed popularity. Many Western designers have integrated elements of cheongsam into their fashion collections. French designer Pierre Cardin once said that cheongsam was his inspiration for many of his evening dress designs. In many films and movies, cheongsam is used to make a fashion statement. The varied interpretations of this ethnic dress brings in debates of cultural appropriation and the designs being linked to Orientalism. In the 2011 movie &quot;One Day&quot;, Anne Hathaway wore a set of dark blue cheongsam as an evening dress. Many western stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Grace Kelly, Nicole Kidman, Paris Hilton, Emma Watson, and Celine Dion have also made public appearances wearing cheongsam.
This dress style has also been specifically seen on more than one celebrity or figure in the early 2000&#x27;s. This era is often described as a &quot;global mash up&quot;, incorporating styles, silhouettes, prints, and accessories from subcultures around the world. And with this, the qipao made a frequent appearance on the runways and in the closets from the early 2000&#x27;s. In the 1998, family comedy The Parent Trap, Lindsey Lohan&#x27;s 11 year old character has a prominent scene wearing a pink qipao, paired with a little matching fluffy pink trimmed purse, also an iconic Y2k accessory. 

This heightened attention of global fashions from Asia brought to Western pop culture&#x27;s wardrobe, whilst being shone in starlight with social media and tabloids fawning over these &#x27;new&#x27; styles, also caused insensitive representation of the fashions, also known as Cultural appropriation. The Cheongsam was also sold in stores as a Halloween costume for young girls and women to wear, pretending to be a person of Asian descent as their costume. This created more conversation as more voices of minorities were heard, that this cultural dress is not appreciated when it is sold as a costume. However, as conversations of cultural appropriation increase and social awareness is spread through media platforms and social media, these racially insensitive costumes have since been left more in the past.

== Cultural and historical significance ==
The cheongsam became a national dress of the Republic of China, along with the , a traditional clothing attire of the Han Chinese women. It was eventually accepted by the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a form of &quot;hanfu&quot;, thus becoming transnational and representative of a generic Chinese national identity rather than an ethnic or ancestral identity.

The cheongsam can be worn by people of all ages and at any season. It is also used as a style Traditional Chinese wedding dress among many others. For overseas Chinese, the cheongsam has often used as a form of emblematic culture.

In the 1920s, the cheongsam was originally an embodiment of Chinese women&#x27;s rebellion and a heroic gesture and a marker of Chinese feminism and Chinese women&#x27;s emancipation.

=== Roles in Chinese nationalism and women&#x27;s liberation ===
The Republican period is the golden age of the cheongsam. In exploring the reasons behind its prevalence in Republic of China, many scholars relate it to the women&#x27;s liberation movements. After the feudal Qing dynasty was overturned, Chinese feminists called for women&#x27;s liberation from traditional roles. They led several movements against the Neo-Confucian gender segregation, including the termination of foot binding for women, cutting off long hair, which was conventionally symbolized as women&#x27;s &quot;oriental&quot; beauty, and encouraging women to wear men&#x27;s one-piece clothing, Changshan or &quot;changpao&quot;.

&quot;Changpao&quot; was traditionally taken as men&#x27;s patent throughout the long history from Han dynasty (202 BC to 220) to Qing dynasty (1616–1911). During that time, Chinese Han female&#x27;s clothing gradually developed into two pieces. Women were forbidden to wear robes as men did and instead had to wear tops and bottoms known as &quot;Liang jie yi&quot;. After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 (which overthrew the Qing dynasty), young Chinese people began to learn Western science and cultures in order to seek a way of saving the nation. Also, the opening of several ports and ceding territories of China to Western powers imported some Western ideas to mainland China. Among all these Western thoughts, the idea of gender equality quickly gained its followers, among whom young female students became its prime advocates.

It was the May Thirteenth Movement of 1925, where anti-Westernization demonstrations persisted throughout the country, that served as an important push for the qipao&#x27;s institutionalization. The Republicans declared the qipao a formal dress in the Clothing Regulations of 1929. The dress was meant to assert the importance of nationalism by rejecting Western forms of dress. That being said, there were still strict rules regulating how the dress needed to be worn, including specifications about length, material, accessories, collar, buttons, and sleeves, but curiously enough, none of these were followed.

From the start, there was no unifying style for the dress like the Republicans intended; Chinese women had no respect for the Clothing Regulations of 1929, which tried to control individuality. There were endless variations in style, with adaptations to length, material, hemlines, collars, fabrics, patterns, colors, and pairing accessories. It was worn by everyone from Shanghai socialites to students, housewives, and prostitutes. The style of the qipao was often in tune with fashion cycles and was influenced by Western trends seen through women styling it with matching scarves, fur coats, and leather heels. Magazines such as LingLong also gave women access to dressmaking knowledge and normalized it for women to make their dresses in their style. The base form of the qipao is rather simple to sew, which makes it easily accessible and economical.

The style of cheongsam also varied due to Western influence. It changed from a wide and loose style to a more form-fitting and revealing cut, which put more emphasis on women&#x27;s body lines. The length of the cheongsam was also reduced from the ankle reaching to above the knee.

The design of the cheongsam got various inventions like ruffled collars, bell-like sleeves, and black lace frothing. Starting from that, the priority of cheongsam moved from a political expression to an aesthetic and ornamental emphasis.

=== Intangible cultural heritage ===
Due to its long history dating back to the Manchu clothing of the early Qing dynasty, the Beijing-style cheongsam-making technique is listed as a city-level intangible cultural heritage.

The Hongkong Cheongsam-making technique is unique due to its historical background, having incorporated both Eastern and Western clothing designs before giving the Hongkong-style cheongsam its distinctive looks. In 2021, the Hong Kong cheongsam making technique was successfully listed on the fifth National List of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

=== Authenticity as ethnic wear ===
In Western countries, the cheongsam is widely perceived as being a quintessential Chinese garment. However, the cheongsam is a type of Chinese clothing which was developed in the 20th century under the influences of several cultures, including Western culture, Manchu culture, and the Han Chinese culture. The cheongsam also had a significant impact on international fashion centers in the 1950s and 1960s, such as Paris, Rome, and New York, due to its perceived exoticism and its slim line silhouette which was also fashionable in Europe at those times. Descendants of Chinese immigrants or overseas Chinese in Western countries, such as Canada, may wear cheongsam on events such as weddings, graduation ceremonies, and other occasions; however, the cheongsam is not always perceived as being traditional Chinese clothing; for example, some Canadians of Han Chinese descent still remember the use of as their traditional Chinese dress.

In Suriname, the cheongsam is not only presented as being the quintessential Chinese dress but also as the authentic Chinese ethnic clothing; however, the Chinese ethnic clothing, which should have been used, is the , consisting of a (jacket) and a pair of trousers, as it was the attire which was worn by the Hakka people who came in Suriname as indentured laborers and chain immigrants. The use of cheongsam as a cultural marker of Chineseness can be thus perceived as ironic, and a cultural stereotype of Chineseness as the cheongsam is not associated with any specific ancestral clothing of Chinese immigrants.

In Indonesia, the cheongsam has experienced acculturation from Chinese culture and Indonesian culture, one of which is the batik-patterned cheongsam which has become the main cultural identity in Indonesia. In recent years, the trend of Chinese clothing combined with local elements has started to become popular. The euphoria of acculturating Chinese and Indonesian culture is driven by local Chinese citizens who want to show that they love their homeland. Cheongsam clothing made from batik is very attractive fashion, there are clothing models that are suitable to wear during Chinese New Year celebrations. Clothing that is an acculturation of Indonesian and Chinese culture is very suitable to complement the celebration.

=== Appreciation and rejection in overseas Chinese community ===
The cheongsam was introduced in Canada after the early 1930s with the flow of Chinese immigrants. However, the wearing the cheongsam is mixed amongst Canadians with Chinese heritage. Some may be reluctant to wear it publicly due to their experiences of being part of a racialized group and/or due to self-loathing due to the experiences of racism and marginalization in various forms, such as physical attacks, ostracism, and bullying, the social pressure to integrate and/or the desire to assimilate in the dominant culture as a protective mechanism even at the expense of rejecting any aspects or association with Chinese culture, identity, and appearance in the dress. Others may wear the cheongsam as an attempt to reconnect with their Chinese heritage and/or to show appreciation to the dress. Some may find themselves uncomfortable or feel alienation when wearing cheongsam due to the lack of self-identification with Chinese culture and Chinese identity.

=== Controversies on origin ===
The cheongsam is generally considered to be adapted from the one-piece dress of Manchu women during the Qing dynasty which survived from the 1911 Revolution surviving the political changes and improved until it has become the traditional dress for Chinese women. However, there has been considerable debate on the origin of the cheongsam in academic circles. The following are three common arguments on the origin of the cheongsam:

The first argument says that the cheongsam came directly from the clothing of the banner people when the Manchu ruled China during the Qing dynasty. This argument was prominently represented by Zhou Xibao () in his work &quot;The History of Ancient Chinese Clothing and Ornaments&quot;.

The second opinion holds that the cheongsam inherited some features of the &quot;chángpáo&quot; of Banner People in the Qing dynasty, but the true origin of the cheongsam dates back to a period between the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BC) and the pre-Qin era, approximately two millennia before the Qing dynasty. According to Yuan Jieying&#x27;s () book &quot;Chinese Cheongsam&quot;, the modern cheongsam shares many similarities with the narrow-cut straight skirt that women wore in the Western Zhou dynasty. And Chinese Professor Bao Minxin () also pointed out in his book &quot;A Real Record of Modern Chinese Costume&quot; that the cheongsam originated from the ancient robe in the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). The robe is a one-piece upper and lower connected long dress which was quite popular among ladies in Han.

The third argument was raised by Bian Xiangyang () in his book &quot;An Analysis on the Origin of Qipao&quot;. Bian thinks that the cheongsam originates from neither the robe nor the &quot;chángpáo&quot;. It is an adaption of Western-style dress during the Republic of China era when people were open to the Western cultures. In his opinion, the cheongsam was a hybrid of traditional Chinese costumes and Western costumes such as the waistcoat and one-piece dress. Moreover, according to him, Chinese women traditionally wore trousers under their clothing and the use of silk stockings under the cheongsam or being bare legs is not a Chinese tradition but the result of Western influence.

== Similar garments ==
The Vietnamese &quot;áo dài&quot; looks similar to the cheongsam as they both consist of a long robe with side splits on both sides of the robe with one of the main difference typically being the height of the side split.

The &quot;áo dài&quot; was developed from the clothing worn in Chinese court but it could only be worn by the royalty originally. The &quot;áo dài&quot; was derived from &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; (lit. &#x27;five-panel gown&#x27;) which was a Nguyễn court fashion which drew strong influences from the civil and military official clothing practices used in China; the &quot;áo dài&quot; also evolved from the early prototypes decreed by Nguyễn Phúc Khoát.

In the 18th century, in an attempt to separate his domain from Tonkin ruled by his rival Trịnh clan and build an independent state, Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (reigned 1738–1765) forced his subjects to wear Ming dynasty style Chinese clothing. The ethnic Kinh robe (i.e. the traditional &quot;áo giao lĩnh&quot;, a type of crossed-collar robe, which was identical to the ones worn by the Han Chinese). was, therefore, replaced by a robe with Chinese-style fasteners, which was buttoned in the front, and had an upright collar. The skirt which was worn by the Vietnamese was also replaced by trousers under his rule. This form of new fashion became the prototype of the &quot;áo dài&quot;; it was a form of &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; which was invented by Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát; the &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; also had 5 flaps instead of 4 (the 5th flap was small and was found under the front garment) and 5 buttons. Another new form of fashion included a type of four-panel robe which was described by Lê Quý Đôn as an &quot;áo dài&quot; which was loose fitting similarly to the &quot;á&quot;o giao lãnh. Under the rule of Emperor Minh Mạng, two new forms of &quot;áo dài&quot; were created from the &quot;áo ngũ thân&quot; regulated by Nguyễn Phúc Khoát: the &quot;áo tứ thân&quot;, and the &quot;Huế-style áo dài&quot; which was created with five flaps&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Huế-style áo dài&quot; represented royal court culture of the &quot;Huế&quot; and later developed influenced the modern &quot;áo dài&quot;.

<text>A motor skill is a function that involves specific movements of the body&#x27;s muscles to perform a certain task. These tasks could include walking, running, or riding a bike. In order to perform this skill, the body&#x27;s nervous system, muscles, and brain have to all work together. The goal of motor skill is to optimize the ability to perform the skill at the rate of success, precision, and to reduce the energy consumption required for performance. Performance is an act of executing a motor skill or task. Continuous practice of a specific motor skill will result in a greatly improved performance, which leads to motor learning. Motor learning is a relatively permanent change in the ability to perform a skill as a result of continuous practice or experience.

A fundamental movement skill is a developed ability to move the body in coordinated ways to achieve consistent performance at demanding physical tasks, such as found in sports, combat or personal locomotion, especially those unique to humans, such as ice skating, skateboarding, kayaking, or horseback riding. Movement skills generally emphasize stability, balance, and a coordinated muscular progression from prime movers (legs, hips, lower back) to secondary movers (shoulders, elbow, wrist) when conducting explosive movements, such as throwing a baseball. In most physical training, development of core musculature is a central focus. In the athletic context, fundamental movement skills draw upon human physiology and sport psychology.

==Types of motor skills==
Motor skills are movements and actions of the muscles. There are two major groups of motor skills:
* Gross motor skills – require the use of large muscle groups in our legs, torso, and arms to perform tasks such as: walking, balancing, and crawling. The skill required is not extensive and therefore are usually associated with continuous tasks. Much of the development of these skills occurs during early childhood. We use our gross motor skills on a daily basis without putting much thought or effort into them. The performance level of gross motor skill remains unchanged after periods of non-use. Gross motor skills can be further divided into two subgroups: Locomotor skills, such as running, jumping, sliding, and swimming; and object-control skills such as throwing, catching, dribbling, and kicking.
* Fine motor skills – require the use of smaller muscle groups to perform smaller movements. These muscles include those found in our wrists, hands, fingers, feet and in our toes. These tasks are precise in nature like: playing the piano, tying shoelaces, brushing your teeth, and flossing. Some fine motor skills may be susceptible to retention loss of over a period of time if not in use. The phrase &quot;if you don&#x27;t use it, you lose it&quot; is a perfect way to describe these skills, they need to be continuously used. Discrete tasks such as switch gears in an automobile, grasping an object, or striking a match, usually require more fine motor skill than gross motor skills.
Both gross and fine motor skills can become weakened or damaged. Some reasons for these impairments could be caused by an injury, illness, stroke, congenital deformities (an abnormal change in the size or shape of a body part at birth), cerebral palsy, and developmental disabilities. Problems with the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, muscles, or joints can also have an effect on these motor skills, and decrease control over them.

== Development ==
Motor skills develop in different parts of a body along three principles:
* Cephalocaudal – the principle that development occurs from head to tail. For example, infants first learn to lift their heads on their own, followed by sitting up with assistance, then sitting up by themselves. Followed by scooting, crawling, pulling up, and then walking.
* Proximodistal – the principle that movement of limbs that are closer to the body develop before the parts that are further away. For example, a baby learns to control their upper arm before their hands and fingers. Fine movements of the fingers are the last to develop in the body.
* Gross to specific – a pattern in which larger muscle movements develop before finer movements. For example, a child will go from only being able to pick up large objects, to then being able to pick up an object that is small, between the thumb and fingers. The earlier movements involve larger groups of muscles, but as the child grows, finer movements become possible and specific tasks can be achieved. An example of this would be a young child learning to grasp a pencil.

In children, a critical period for the development of motor skills is preschool years (ages 3–5), as fundamental neuroanatomic structure shows significant development, elaboration, and myelination over the course of this period. Many factors contribute to the rate that children develop their motor skills. Unless afflicted with a severe disability, children are expected to develop a wide range of basic movement abilities and motor skills around a certain age. Motor development progresses in seven stages throughout an individual&#x27;s life: reflexive, rudimentary, fundamental, sports skill, growth and refinement, peak performance, and regression. Development is age-related but is not age dependent. In regard to age, it is seen that typical developments are expected to attain gross motor skills used for postural control and vertical mobility by 5 years of age.

There are six aspects of development:
* Qualitative – changes in movement-process results in changes in movement-outcome.
* Sequential – certain motor patterns precede others.
* Cumulative – current movements are built on previous ones.
* Directional – cephalocaudal or proximodistal
* Multifactorial – numerous-factors impact
* Individual – dependent on each person

In the childhood stages of development, gender differences can greatly influence motor skills. In the article &quot;An Investigation of Age and Gender Differences in Preschool Children&#x27;s Specific Motor Skills&quot;, girls scored significantly higher than boys on visual motor and graphomotor tasks. The results from this study suggest that girls attain manual dexterity earlier than boys. Variability of results in the tests can be attributed towards the multiplicity of different assessment tools used. Furthermore, gender differences in motor skills are seen to be affected by environmental factors. In essence, &quot;parents and teachers often encourage girls to engage in [quiet] activities requiring fine motor skills, while they promote boys&#x27; participation in dynamic movement actions&quot;. In the journal article &quot;Gender Differences in Motor Skill Proficiency From Childhood to Adolescence&quot; by Lisa Barrett, the evidence for gender-based motor skills is apparent. In general, boys are more skillful in object control and object manipulation skills. These tasks include throwing, kicking, and catching skills. These skills were tested and concluded that boys perform better with these tasks. There was no evidence for the difference in locomotor skill between the genders, but both are improved in the intervention of physical activity. Overall, the predominance of development was on balance skills (gross motor) in boys and manual skills (fine motor) in girls.

===Components of development===
* Growth – increase in the size of the body or its parts as the individual progresses toward maturity (quantitative structural changes)
* Maturation – refers to qualitative changes that enable one to progress to higher levels of functioning; it is primarily innate
* Experience or learning – refers to factors within the environment that may alter or modify the appearance of various developmental characteristics through the process of learning
* Adaptation – refers to the complex interplay or interaction between forces within the individual (nature) and the environment (nurture)

=== Influences on development ===
* Stress and arousal – stress and anxiety are the result of an imbalance between the demand of a task and the capacity of the individual. In this context, arousal defines the amount of interest in the skill. The optimal performance level is moderate stress or arousal.
* Fatigue – the deterioration of performance when a stressful task is continued for a long time, similar to the muscular fatigue experienced when exercising rapidly or over a long period. Fatigue is caused by over-arousal. Fatigue impacts an individual in many ways: perceptual changes in which visual acuity or awareness drops, slowing of performance (reaction times or movements speed), irregularity of timing, and disorganization of performance. A study conducted by Meret Branscheidt concluded that fatigue interferes with the learning of new motor skills. In the experiment, participants were split into two different groups. One group worked the muscles in their hands until they were physically fatigued and then had to learn a new motor task, while the second group learned the task without being fatigued. Those that were fatigued had a harder time learning these new motor skills compared to those who were not. Even in the days following, after the fatigue had subsided, they still had difficulty learning those same tasks.
* Vigilance – the ability to maintain attention over time and respond appropriately to relevant stimuli. When vigilance is lost, it can result in slower responses or the failure to respond to stimuli all together. Some tasks include actions that require little work and high attention.
* Gender – gender plays an important role in the development of the child. Girls are more likely to be seen performing fine stationary visual motor-skills, whereas boys predominantly exercise object-manipulation skills. While researching motor development in preschool-aged children, girls were more likely to be seen performing skills such as skipping, hopping, or skills with the use of hands only. Boys were seen to perform gross skills such as kicking or throwing a ball or swinging a bat. There are gender-specific differences in qualitative throwing performance, but not necessarily in quantitative throwing performance. Male and female athletes demonstrated similar movement patterns in humerus and forearm actions but differed in trunk, stepping, and backswing actions.

== Stages of motor learning ==
Motor learning is a change, resulting from practice. It often involves improving the accuracy of movements both simple and complex as one&#x27;s environment changes. Motor learning is a relatively permanent skill as the capability to respond appropriately is acquired and retained.

The stages of motor learning are the cognitive phase, the associative phase, and the autonomous phase.
* Cognitive phase – When a learner is new to a specific task, the primary thought process starts with, &quot;What needs to be done?&quot; Considerable cognitive activity is required so that the learner can determine appropriate strategies to adequately reflect the desired goal. Good strategies are retained and inefficient strategies are discarded. The performance is greatly improved in a short amount of time.
* Associative phase – The learner has determined the most-effective way to do the task and starts to make subtle adjustments in performance. Improvements are more gradual and movements become more consistent. This phase can last for a long time. The skills in this phase are fluent, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing.
* Autonomous phase – This phase may take several months to years to reach. The phase is dubbed &quot;autonomous&quot; because the performer can now &quot;automatically&quot; complete the task without having to pay any attention to performing it. Examples include walking and talking or sight reading while doing simple arithmetic.

== Law of effect ==

Motor-skill acquisition has long been defined in the scientific community as an energy-intensive form of stimulus-response (S-R) learning that results in robust neuronal modifications. In 1898, Edward Thorndike proposed the law of effect, which states that the association between some action (R) and some environmental condition (S) is enhanced when the action is followed by a satisfying outcome (O). For instance, if an infant moves his right hand and left leg in just the right way, he can perform a crawling motion, thereby producing the satisfying outcome of increasing his mobility. Because of the satisfying outcome, the association between being on all fours and these particular arm and leg motions are enhanced. Further, a dissatisfying outcome weakens the S-R association. For instance, when a toddler contracts certain muscles, resulting in a painful fall, the child will decrease the association between these muscle contractions and the environmental condition of standing on two feet.

== Feedback ==
During the learning process of a motor skill, feedback is the positive or negative response that tells the learner how well the task was completed.
Inherent feedback: after completing the skill, inherent feedback is the sensory information that tells the learner how well the task was completed. A basketball player will note that he or she made a mistake when the ball misses the hoop. Another example is a diver knowing that a mistake was made when the entry into the water is painful and undesirable.
Augmented feedback: in contrast to inherent feedback, augmented feedback is information that supplements or &quot;augments&quot; the inherent feedback. For example, when a person is driving over a speed limit and is pulled over by the police. Although the car did not do any harm, the policeman gives augmented feedback to the driver in order for him to drive more safely. Another example is a private tutor for a new student in a field of study. Augmented feedback decreases the amount of time to master the motor skill and increases the performance level of the prospect.
Transfer of motor skills: the gain or loss in the capability for performance in one task as a result of practice and experience on some other task. An example would be the comparison of initial skill of a tennis player and non-tennis player when playing table tennis for the first time. An example of a negative transfer is if it takes longer for a typist to adjust to a randomly assigned letter of the keyboard compared to a new typist.
Retention: the performance level of a particular skill after a period of no use.

The type of task can have an effect on how well the motor skill is retained after a period of non-use:
* Continuous tasks – activities like swimming, bicycling, or running; the performance level retains proficiency even after years of non-use.
* Discrete tasks – an instrument, video game, or a sport; the performance level drops significantly but will be better than a new learner. The relationship between the two tasks is that continuous tasks usually use gross motor skills and discrete tasks use fine motor skills.

==Brain structures==
The regions of the frontal lobe responsible for motor skill include the primary motor cortex, the supplemental motor area, and the premotor cortex. The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus and is often visualized as the motor homunculus. By stimulating certain areas of the motor strip and observing where it had an effect, Penfield and Rassmussen were able to map out the motor homunculus. Areas on the body that have complex movements, such as the hands, have a bigger representation on the motor homunculus.

The supplemental motor area, which is just anterior to the primary motor cortex, is involved with postural stability and adjustment as well as coordinating sequences of movement. The premotor cortex, which is just below the supplemental motor area, integrates sensory information from the posterior parietal cortex and is involved with the sensory-guided planning of movement and begins the programming of movement.

The basal ganglia are an area of the brain where gender differences in brain physiology is evident. The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei in the brain that is responsible for a variety of functions, some of which include movement. The globus pallidus and putamen are two nuclei of the basal ganglia which are both involved in motor skills. The globes pallid-us is involved with the voluntary motor movement, while the putamen is involved with motor learning. Even after controlling for the naturally larger volume of the male brain, it was found that males have a larger volume of both the globus pallidus and putamen.

The cerebellum is an additional area of the brain important for motor skills. The cerebellum controls fine motor skills as well as balance and coordination. Although women tend to have better fine motor skills, the cerebellum has a larger volume in males than in females, even after correcting for the fact that males naturally have a larger brain volume.

Hormones are an additional factor that contributes to gender differences in motor skill. For instance, women perform better on manual dexterity tasks during times of high estradiol and progesterone levels, as opposed to when these hormones are low such as during menstruation.

An evolutionary perspective is sometimes drawn upon to explain how gender differences in motor skills may have developed, although this approach is controversial. For instance, it has been suggested that men were the hunters and provided food for the family, while women stayed at home taking care of the children and doing domestic work. Some theories of human development suggest that men&#x27;s tasks involved gross motor skill such as chasing after prey, throwing spears and fighting. Women, on the other hand, used their fine motor skills the most in order to handle domestic tools and accomplish other tasks that required fine motor-control.

<text>The motor system is the set of central and peripheral structures in the nervous system that support motor functions, i.e. movement. Peripheral structures may include skeletal muscles and neural connections with muscle tissues. Central structures include cerebral cortex, brainstem, spinal cord, pyramidal system including the upper motor neurons, extrapyramidal system, cerebellum, and the lower motor neurons in the brainstem and the spinal cord.

The motor system is a biological system with close ties to the muscular system and the circulatory system. To achieve motor skill, the motor system must accommodate the working state of the muscles, whether hot or cold, stiff or loose, as well as physiological fatigue. 

==Pyramidal motor system==

The pyramidal motor system, also called the pyramidal tract or the corticospinal tract, start in the motor center of the cerebral cortex. There are upper and lower motor neurons in the corticospinal tract. The motor impulses originate in the giant pyramidal cells or Betz cells of the motor area; i.e., precentral gyrus of cerebral cortex. These are the upper motor neurons (UMN) of the corticospinal tract. The axons of these cells pass in the depth of the cerebral cortex to the corona radiata and then to the internal capsule, passing through the posterior branch of internal capsule and continuing to descend in the midbrain and the medulla oblongata. In the lower part of the medulla oblongata, 90–95% of these fibers decussate (pass to the opposite side) and descend in the white matter of the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord on the opposite side. The remaining 5–10% pass to the same side. Fibers for the extremities (limbs) pass 100% to the opposite side. The fibers of the corticospinal tract terminate at different levels in the anterior horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord. Here, the lower motor neurons (LMN) of the corticospinal cord are located. Peripheral motor nerves carry the motor impulses from the anterior horn to the voluntary muscles.

==Extrapyramidal motor system==

The extrapyramidal motor system consists of motor-modulation systems, particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum. For information, see extrapyramidal system.

<doc id="232392" wikidata="Q4632083" url="?curid=232392" title="253 (novel)">
<text>253, or Tube Theatre, is a novel by Canadian writer Geoff Ryman, originally created as a website in 1997, then published as a print book titled 253: The Print Remix in 1998. The print version won a Philip K. Dick Award.

==Synopsis==
&quot;253&quot; is about the 253 people on a London Underground train travelling between Embankment station and Elephant &amp; Castle on January 11, 1995. The basic structure of the novel is explained in the foreword:

Each character is introduced in a separate section containing 253 words, which give general details and describe the thoughts going through the characters&#x27; heads. In the online version, hypertext links lead to other characters who are nearby or who have some connection to the current character; in the print version, the links are partly replaced by a traditional index. The reader can proceed from one character to another using these devices or can read the novel in positional order, e.g. from one seat and one train car to the next, but there is no overall chronological order except in the final section.

The novel ends with the train crashing.

==Interpretations==
Ryman states that the meaning of &quot;253&quot; is dramatically changed when read in digital form as opposed to print form. In reading 253 on the internet the links between passengers create and emphasize existing similarities between the passengers. It becomes a text about how intrinsically similar people are. Whereas, in print form &quot;253&quot; is about how different people are. A lack of links between passengers means that the reader must traverse the story linearly, thereby emphasizing the differences between passengers.

==Reception==
Charles de Lint gave the print edition a mixed review, declaring: &quot;Is it worth reading? Definitely. Is it the fiction of the future? I hope not. As a one-off, it&#x27;s entertaining, and even thought-provoking, but it took me a long time to read, simply because I kept setting it aside after every half-dozen or so entries to read something with a more coherent narrative. Call me old-fashioned, but I doubt I&#x27;d try another.&quot; NPR&#x27;s Mary Glendinning reviewed the print version more favourably as &quot;Gimmicky? Perhaps. Funny, sharp and sad? Yes. Entertaining? Definitely.&quot;

<text>The Decepticons are a fictional faction of sentient robots in the &quot;Transformers&quot; multimedia franchise. Serving as the main antagonists in the franchise, their goals include conquering their fictional homeworld planet Cybertron, defeating the Autobots, and achieving universal domination.

==Description==
They are depicted as a faction of sentient robotic lifeforms led by Megatron, identified by a purple face-like insignia and they have red eyes (while the Autobots have blue eyes). Capable of transforming into alternate forms, these are often high tech vehicles; including aircraft, military vehicles, heavy equipment, ground combat vehicles, expensive luxury cars, sports cars and even smaller-than-human-sized objects.

In the Japanese version of the franchise, the Decepticons are called Destron or Deathtron ( &quot;Desutoron&quot;). The only exception to this naming convention is &quot;Car Robots&quot;, where the sub-group referred to as &quot;Decepticons&quot; in the &quot;&quot; adaptation, is known in Japan as the Combatrons (the Japanese name of the G1 subgroup known as the Combaticons).

As opposed to the Autobots&#x27; Supreme Commander, the Primes, the Decepticons&#x27; highest ranking leader is often given the title Emperor of Destruction in Japan. Beginning with the original Generation 1 cartoon, the Decepticon rallying cry has been &quot;Decepticons attack!&quot;, as well as &quot;Transform and rise up!&quot; in &quot;&quot; as a play on the Autobots&#x27; &quot;Transform and roll out!&quot; rallying cry.

==Recurring members==
*Megatron: The arch-nemesis of Optimus Prime, he is often the leader of the Decepticons and main antagonist in most incarnations.His origins that is more recent incarnations is that he used to be a miner or glaidtor named D-16 before renaming himself Megatron and was once friendly acquittances with Optimus Prime before their fallout. His original alt mode is a gun, but later versions have him turn into a tank, jet or helicopter, owing to toy safety laws. 
*Galvatron: The arch-enemy of Hot Rod and Ultra Mangus, Galvatron is a cruel and deranged leader of the Decepticons. In most continuities, he is often the upgraded from of Megatron, but some later versions made him into a separate entity from him. His original alt mode was a moving cannon, but later depictions have him turn into a jet or tank, like Megatron. Indeed, many continuities depicting Megatron and Galvatron as the same often have the character&#x27;s colours changed to show him as Galvatron.
*Starscream: The leader of the Seekers, Megatron&#x27;s de facto deputy, and a power-hungry traitor trying to overcome anyone who gets in his way. He turns into a jet.
*Soundwave: The communication officer, he is a loyal minion of Megatron his alt mode was a cassette player but later versions give him a van or jet mode.
*Shockwave: A purple Decepticon, often depicted with just a single eye in the middle of his face. He serves as the scientist obsessed with logic. His original alt mode was a futuristic gun, but later continuities turn him into a tank or jet.
*Blitzwing: A triple changer with a tank and jet modes.
*Airachnid: A sadistic female Transformer with spider-like features and a helicopter mode.
*Nightbird: A female ninja who debuted in the original series as a human-built robot that is reprogrammed by the Decepticons, but later appeared in recent versions with a car alt mode.
*Sideways: A spy with the ability to disguise himself.
*Blackarachnia: A female Predacon who appears in the Beast era appearing in other mediums with a Mesothelae-alt mode.
*Barricade: A ruthless Decepticon soldier, who often turns into a car.
*Cyclonus: A noble warrior serving as Galvatron&#x27;s right-hand man in some versions. His alt mode is a jet.
*Scourge: A ruthless hunter who leads the Sweeps (Decepticons who look just like him) and turns into a hovercraft. He is sometimes an evil version of Optimus Prime; in such cases, he transforms into whatever kind of truck that continuity&#x27;s Optimus does.
* Bludgeon: A Decepticon pretender who debuted in the comics and took over leadership. His alt mode was a tank.
* The Fallen: Megatronus Prime, one of the Thirteen primes, often turns evil and inspires D-16 to become Megatron and lead the decepticons sometimes. His alt mode is often a tank, except for the film &quot;&quot; where it was a jet.
* Lockdown: A bounty hunter who sometimes affiliated with the Decepticons his alt mode is a car.
* Scorponok: A large Decepticon headmaster who serves as one of the leaders of the Decepticons in some versions. Other versions of Scorponok varies to simply be generic foot soldiers or a smaller character. As his name implies, he transforms into a scorpion or scorpion-themed vehicle.
* Trypticon: A large kaiju-sized, Godzilla-themed Transformer who turns into a city and a battle station.

==Other Relations==
*Quintessons-a techno-organic race, sometimes allied to the Decepticons, or enemies to both them and the Autobots. In several continuities, they are the creators of all Transformers.
*Unicron- The Chaos bringer and the evil twin brother of Primus. He would often have Decepticons as his heralds.
*Nemesis Prime- A clone of Optimus Prime, with none of his morals, though he is sometimes depicted as an independent villain from the Decepticons.
*Soundblaster- Originally an upgraded, black-coloured version of Soundwave, later versions portray him as a separate individual usually associated with the mercenary faction.

==Factions==

There are different factions of the Decepticons:

* Insecticons - A group of Decepticons who have insect forms and reproduce through cloning, with the clones often serving as expandable drones.
* Constructicons - A group of Decepticons who have construction vehicle forms. They are often shown combining into Devastator.
* Stunticons - A group of Decepticons who are made up of Cybertronians who can assume car form and one who can assume a truck form. They are often shown combining into Menasor.
* Combaticons - A group of Decepticons who have military vehicle forms. They are often shown combining into Bruticus.
* Predacons - A group of Decepticons who have animal forms. They are often shown combining into Predaking. The Predacon name was used for the main villains in &quot;Beast Wars: Transformers&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
* Terrorcons - A group of Decepticons with monster forms. They are often shown combining into Abominus. Later versions are used to be related to Unicron.
* Seacons - A group of Decepticons with aquatic forms. They are often shown combining into Piranhacon. Five of the Seacons also have a third Targetmaster mode; when forming Piranhacon, the leader forms the torso, four others form the limbs, and the sixth will usually become a gun for Piranhacon to use.
* Horrorcons - A pair of triple-changing Decepticons with jet and beast alternate modes, both of which have Headmaster partners.
* Vehicons - The foot soldiers of the Decepticons. The Vehicon name was used for the main villains in &quot;Beast Machines: Transformers&quot;.
* Duocons - A pair of Decepticons whose alternate forms are actually split into two separate vehicles, a flying one and a ground one, which combine to form the robot.
* Seekers- A group of Decepticons led by Starscream with them serving as the flying armada.

==Depictions in media==
===Transformers: Generation 1===

The original animated series depicts the Decepticons as a malevolent faction of robots dedicated to the conquest of their home planet Cybertron. A war that lasted millions of years and soon that drained the planet of energy. The Autobots, the Decepticons&#x27; heroic rivals, chose to flee Cybertron in hopes of finding more resources aboard their flagship the Ark, but were pursued by the Decepticons aboard their own warship, the Nemesis.
The two vessels clashed and the Decepticons boarded the Ark. In the ensuing struggle, control over the ship was lost and the Ark crashed on prehistoric Earth. Four million years passed before a tremor in 1984 reactivated the Decepticons, who assumed alternate modes based on Earth vehicles and technology and set out to conquer the planet and plunder its resources.
However, the Autobots were also reactivated and resolved to defend the planet and its inhabitants from the Decepticons&#x27; ill intent.

===Transformers: EarthSpark===

Under Megatron, the Decepticons originally fought the war on the ideals of creating a more equal Cybertron. With the war&#x27;s expansion to Earth however, Megatron soon came to realize how far his faction had strayed from his original vision and readily joined the Autobots in hopes of ending the conflict. When Megatron seemingly destroyed the AllSpark in the final battle of the war on Earth, the Decepticons found themselves stranded on Earth as the SpaceBridge to Cybertron was destroyed along with it. For his actions Megatron was falsely branded a traitor by many of his former soldiers such as Shockwave and Soundwave.

Stranded on Earth, the Decepticons were forced to go on the run to evade imprisonment by G.H.O.S.T. and had to resort to stealing Energon. Even high ranking commanders such as Starscream found themselves becoming the prisoners of the Autobot-Human alliance. Many hapless Decepticons though found themselves working for the anti-Cybertronian scientist, Mandroid, as usually either mind-controlled slaves or as part of a deal to protect them from G.H.O.S.T.

While as prisoners of G.H.O.S.T., Decepticons such as Skullcruncher found themselves being unwilling experiments that left them severely weakened. When the Terran, Hashtag, inadvertently hacked G.H.O.S.T.&#x27;s security systems she ended up disabling the shields of the prison cells containing their Decepticon prisoners, leading to a short-lived prison uprising.

Many Decepticons found themselves participating in underground fighting rings known as &quot;Bot Brawls&quot; done for the amusement of their human audiences, the losers in these fighting bouts being chained to the ceiling and left to die. One of these being run by Mandroid who salvaged Cybertronian body parts from the losers for his own body modifications. Following another defeat by the Terrans, Mandroid rendezvoused with G.H.O.S.T. director, Karen Croft, where she formalized a partnership between them to begin constructing more Cybertronian control badges to use at her disposal, offering Mandroid the Decepticon prisoners under her watch as his test subjects. Eventually, the Decepticons were freed by the Maltos so they could team up to defeat Mandroid. After several battle in the season one finale, Mandroid eventually uses his super-weapon that shuts down every Cybertronian; Mandroid immediately dies from energon infusion terminal cancer (he readily accepted his timely death and gladly moved on afterwards). Following the human villain&#x27;s death, Robby and Mo Malto use their cyber-sleeves to successfully revive all the Autobots, Decepticons, and Terrans.

One year after the successful defeat and death of Mandroid, a group of Decepticons led by Starscream end up going rogue after the Emberstone is shattered. Two of the shards create the Chaos Terrans named Aftermath and Spitfire. The Decepticons battle the Autobots and the Maltos for the Emberstone shards. Eventually, the Decepticons realize that Starscream has betrayed them when he deactivates Aftermath and Spitfire and reveals his intentions to use the Titan Terran Terratronus to go on a destructive rampage. The Decepticons try to escape, but the Autobots and Maltos create a Chaos Dome that seals the Decepticons and Terratronus inside it, with Starscream trapped behind Terratronus&#x27; left eye.

After Prowl arrives on Earth and crashes on the ground inside the Chaos Dome, the Decepticons plan on using the ship to return home to Cybertron. The Decepticons battle Optimus Prime, Megatron, Prowl and the Maltos; afterwards, the Decepticons board Prowl&#x27;s ship and leave Earth with Starscream watching from Terratronus&#x27; left eye. During the trip, Frenzy and Laserbeak took pictures to send back to the Autobots. Following the Decepticons departure from Earth, the Quintessons eventually arrive on Earth and destroy the Chaos Dome, unleashing a giant storm of Chaos energy; the Autobots and Maltos help the residents of Witwicky evacuate during the storm. The Maltos and the Autobots knew that they needed help from Terratronus and arrived at the female Titan&#x27;s spark chamber to rescue the Chaos Terrans, only to find Starscream having a tea party with their corpses. Starscream was knocked unconscious with the Cyber Slayer by Hashtag, and Prowl dragged Starscream off to the Autobot base. After Starscream was back in custody as punishment for his crimes, the Autobots and Maltos restored the Chaos Terrans to life with the energy from the Chaos storm, restoring clear skies and then Mo restored Terratronus to life so that the female Titan could successfully destroy all the Quintessons for good.

===Transformers One (2024)===

In animation film, the Decepticons were formerly known as the High Guard, working for the original Primes. Led by their leader, Starscream, they know that they witnessed Sentinel Prime&#x27;s betrayal long ago and have been seeking revenge ever since while remaining in hiding. After D-16 defeats Starscream in a fight, he becomes the new leader of the High Guard, after he and some of them are captured by Sentinel&#x27;s guards. Some of the remaining High Guard are led by Orion Pax and Elita-1 to confront Sentinel and expose him for his crimes. In the face of this rebellion and Sentinel&#x27;s death, the High Guard are led by D-16, now renamed Megatron, who orders them to destroy all Iacon. However, after their leader is defeated by Orion and renamed Optimus Prime, Megatron and the High Guard are exiled from Iacon for their war crimes and returned to their hidden location in the desert.

In the end, the High Guard are now renamed into the Decepticons by Megatron, in order to take control of Cybertron, starting the war against Optimus and the Autobots.

<doc id="232403" wikidata="Q2048319" url="?curid=232403" title="Ditch">
<text>A ditch is a small to moderate trench created to channel water. A ditch can be used for drainage, to drain water from low-lying areas, alongside roadways or fields, or to channel water from a more distant source for plant irrigation. Ditches are commonly seen around farmland, especially in areas that have required drainage, such as The Fens in eastern England and much of the Netherlands.

Roadside ditches may provide a hazard to motorists and cyclists, whose vehicles may crash into them and get damaged, flipped over, or stuck and cause major injury, especially in poor weather conditions and rural areas.

== Etymology ==
In Anglo-Saxon, the word &quot;dïc&quot; already existed and was pronounced (&quot;deek&quot;) in northern England and &quot;deetch&quot; in the south. The origins of the word lie in digging a trench and forming the upcast soil into a bank alongside it. This practice has meant that the name &quot;dïc&quot; was given to either the excavation or the bank, and evolved to both the words &quot;dike&quot;/&quot;dyke&quot; and &quot;ditch&quot;.

Thus Offa&#x27;s Dyke is a combined structure and Car Dyke is a trench, though it once had raised banks as well. In the English Midlands and East Anglia, a dyke is what a ditch is in the south of England, a property-boundary marker or drainage channel. Where it carries a stream, it may be called a running dike as in &quot;Rippingale Running Dike&quot;, which leads water from the catchwater drain, Car Dyke, to the South Forty Foot Drain in Lincolnshire (TF1427). The Weir Dike is a soak dike in Bourne North Fen, near Twenty and alongside the River Glen.

==Sustainability of drainage ditches==
Drainage ditches play major roles in agriculture throughout the world. Improper drainage systems accelerate water contamination, excessively desiccate soils during seasonal drought, and become a financial burden to maintain. Industrial earth-moving equipment facilitates maintenance of straight drainage trenches, but entrenchment results in increasing environmental and eventually profound economic costs over time.

Sustainable channel design can result in ditches that are largely self-maintaining due to natural geomorphological equilibrium. Slowed net siltation and erosion result in net reduction in sediment transport. Encouraging development of a natural stream sinuosity and a multi-terraced channel cross section appear to be key to maintain both peak ditch drainage capacity, and minimum net pollution and nutrient transport.

Flooding can be a major cause of recurring crop loss—particularly in heavy soils—and can severely disrupt urban economies as well. Subsurface drainage to ditches offers a way to remove excess water from agricultural fields, or vital urban spaces, without the erosion rates and pollution transport that results from direct surface runoff. However, excess drainage results in recurring drought induced crop yield losses and more severe urban heat island or desiccation issues.

Controlled subsurface drainage from sensitive areas to vegetated drainage ditches makes possible a better balance between water drainage and water retention needs. The initial investment allows a community to draw down local water tables when and where necessary without exacerbating drought problems at other times.

==Water diversion ditches==
Particularly in Colorado, the term ditch is also applied to open aqueducts that traverse hillsides as part of transbasin diversion projects.

Examples include the Grand Ditch over La Poudre Pass, the Berthoud Pass Ditch, and the Boreas Pass Ditch.

==Herbicides==
Herbicides may be used to maintain a ditch. Primarily this is done to deny refuge to weeds that would progress into the adjacent field, but may instead involve only broadleaf herbicides specifically to produce forage and/or hay.

==For forage and hay==
Ditches can provide forage or be harvested for hay. If herbicides are used, however, the resulting manure cannot necessarily be used in crop fields, because in some cases herbicides will pass through and produce crop injury.

<text>A sneeze (also known as sternutation) is a semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth, usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal mucosa. A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action. This action allows for mucus to escape through the nasal cavity and saliva to escape from the oral cavity. Sneezing is possibly linked to sudden exposure to bright light (known as photic sneeze reflex), sudden change (drop) in temperature, breeze of cold air, a particularly full stomach, exposure to allergens, or viral infection. Because sneezes can spread disease through infectious aerosol droplets, it is recommended to cover one&#x27;s mouth and nose with the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or a handkerchief while sneezing. In addition to covering the mouth, looking down is also recommended to change the direction of the droplets spread and avoid high concentration in the human breathing heights.

The function of sneezing is to expel mucus containing foreign particles or irritants and cleanse the nasal cavity. During a sneeze, the soft palate and palatine uvula depress while the back of the tongue elevates to partially close the passage to the mouth, creating a venturi (similar to a carburetor) due to Bernoulli&#x27;s principle so that air ejected from the lungs is accelerated through the mouth and thus creating a low pressure point at the back of the nose. This way air is forced in through the front of the nose and the expelled mucus and contaminants are launched out the mouth. Sneezing with the mouth closed does expel mucus through the nose but is not recommended because it creates a very high pressure in the head and is potentially harmful.

Sneezing cannot occur during sleep due to REM atonia – a bodily state where motor neurons are not stimulated and reflex signals are not relayed to the brain. Sufficient external stimulants, however, may cause a person to wake from sleep to sneeze, but any sneezing occurring afterwards would take place with a partially awake status at minimum.

When sneezing, humans eyes automatically close due to the involuntary reflex during sneeze.
== Description ==

Sneezing typically occurs when foreign particles or sufficient external stimulants pass through the nasal hairs to reach the nasal mucosa. This triggers the release of histamines, which irritate the nerve cells in the nose, resulting in signals being sent to the brain to initiate the sneeze through the trigeminal nerve network. The brain then relates this initial signal, activates the pharyngeal and tracheal muscles and creates a large opening of the nasal and oral cavities, resulting in a powerful release of air and bioparticles. The powerful nature of a sneeze is attributed to its involvement of numerous organs of the upper body – it is a reflexive response involving the face, throat, and chest muscles. Sneezing is also triggered by sinus nerve stimulation caused by nasal congestion and allergies.

The neural regions involved in the sneeze reflex are located in the brainstem along the ventromedial part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and the adjacent pontine-medullary lateral reticular formation. This region appears to control the epipharyngeal, intrinsic laryngeal and respiratory muscles, and the combined activity of these muscles serve as the basis for the generation of a sneeze.

The sneeze reflex involves contraction of a number of different muscles and muscle groups throughout the body, typically including the eyelids. The common suggestion that it is impossible to sneeze with one&#x27;s eyes open is, however, inaccurate. Other than irritating foreign particles, allergies or possible illness, another stimulus is sudden exposure to bright light – a condition known as photic sneeze reflex (PSR). Walking out of a dark building into sunshine may trigger PSR, or the ACHOO (autosomal dominant compulsive helio-ophthalmic outbursts of sneezing) syndrome as it is also called. The tendency to sneeze upon exposure to bright light is an autosomal dominant trait and affects 18–35% of the human population. A rarer trigger, observed in some individuals, is the fullness of the stomach immediately after a large meal. This is known as snatiation and is regarded as a medical disorder passed along genetically as an autosomal dominant trait.

== Epidemiology ==
While generally harmless in healthy individuals, sneezes spread disease through the infectious aerosol droplets, commonly ranging from 0.5 to 5 μm. A sneeze can produce 40,000 droplets. To reduce the possibility of thus spreading disease (such as the flu), one holds the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or a handkerchief in front of one&#x27;s mouth and nose when sneezing. Using one&#x27;s hand for that purpose has recently fallen into disuse as it is considered inappropriate, since it promotes spreading germs through human contact (such as handshaking) or by commonly touched objects (most notably doorknobs).

Until recently, the maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travel was observed at , and the maximum sneeze velocity derived was 4.5 m/s (about 10 mph). In 2020, sneezes were recorded generating plumes of up to .

== Prevention ==

Proven methods to reduce sneezing generally advocate reducing interaction with irritants, such as keeping pets out of the house to avoid animal dander; ensuring the timely and continuous removal of dirt and dust particles through proper housekeeping; replacing filters for furnaces and air-handling units; air filtration devices and humidifiers; and staying away from industrial and agricultural zones. Tickling the roof of the mouth with the tongue can stop a sneeze. Some people, however, find sneezes to be pleasurable and would not want to prevent them.

Holding in sneezes, such as by pinching the nose or holding one&#x27;s breath, is not recommended as the air pressure places undue stress on the lungs and airways. One computer simulation suggests holding in a sneeze results in a burst of air pressure of 39 kPa, approximately 24 times that of a normal sneeze.

In 1884, biologist Henry Walter Bates elucidated the impact of light on the sneezing reflex (Bates H.W. 1881–84. Biologia Centrali-Americana Insecta. Coleoptera. Volume I, Part 1.). He observed that individuals were only capable of sneezing when they felt in control of their entire environment. Consequently, he inferred that people were unable to sneeze in the dark. However, this hypothesis was later debunked.

== History ==

In ancient Greece, sneezes were believed to be prophetic signs from the gods. In 401 BC, for instance, the Athenian general Xenophon gave a speech exhorting his fellow soldiers to fight against the Persians. A soldier underscored his conclusion with a sneeze. Thinking that this sneeze was a favorable sign from the gods, the soldiers were impressed. Another divine moment of sneezing for the Greeks occurs in the story of Odysseus. His waiting wife Penelope, hearing Odysseus may be alive, says that he and his son would take revenge on the suitors if he were to return. At that moment, their son sneezes loudly and Penelope laughs with joy, reassured that it is a sign from the gods (Odyssey 17: 541–550). It may be because this belief survived through the centuries, that in certain parts of Greece today, when someone is asserting something and the listener sneezes promptly at the end of the assertion, the former responds &quot;bless you and I am speaking the truth&quot;, or &quot;bless you and here is the truth&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;ya sou ki alithia leo&quot;, or &quot;&quot;, &quot;ya sou ke na ki i alithia&quot;). A similar practice is also followed in India. If either the person just having made a not most obvious statement in Flemish, or some listener sneezes, often one of the listeners will say &quot;It is beniesd&quot;, literally &quot;It&#x27;s sneezed upon&quot;, as if a proof of truth – usually self-ironically recalling this old superstitious habit, without either suggesting doubt or intending an actual confirmation, but making any apology by the sneezer for the interruption superfluous as the remark is received by smiles.

In Europe, principally around the early Middle Ages, it was believed that one&#x27;s life was in fact tied to one&#x27;s breath – a belief reflected in the word &quot;expire&quot; (originally meaning &quot;to exhale&quot;) gaining the additional meaning of &quot;to come to an end&quot; or &quot;to die&quot;. This connection, coupled with the significant amount of breath expelled from the body during a sneeze, had likely led people to believe that sneezing could easily be fatal. Such a theory could explain the reasoning behind the traditional English phrase, &quot;God bless you&quot;, in response to a sneeze, the origins of which are not entirely clear. Sir Raymond Henry Payne Crawfurd, for instance, the registrar of the Royal College of Physicians, in his 1909 book, &quot;The Last Days of Charles II&quot;, states that, when the controversial monarch was on his deathbed, his medical attendants administered a concoction of cowslips and extract of ammonia to promote sneezing. However, it is not known if this promotion of sneezing was done to hasten his death (as &quot;coup de grâce&quot;) or as an ultimate attempt at treatment.

In certain parts of East Asia, particularly in Chinese culture, Korean culture, Japanese culture and Vietnamese culture, a sneeze without an obvious cause was generally perceived as a sign that someone was talking about the sneezer at that very moment. This can be seen in the &quot;Book of Songs&quot; (a collection of Chinese poems) in ancient China as early as 1000 BC, and in Japan this belief is still depicted in present-day manga and anime. In China, Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan, for instance, there is a superstition that if talking behind someone&#x27;s back causes the person being talked about to sneeze; as such, the sneezer can tell if something good is being said (one sneeze), someone is thinking about you (two sneezes in a row), even if someone is in love with you (three sneezes in a row) or if this is a sign that they are about to catch a cold (multiple sneezes).

Parallel beliefs are known to exist around the world, particularly in contemporary Greek, Slavic, Celtic, English, French, and Indian cultures. Similarly, in Nepal, sneezers are believed to be remembered by someone at that particular moment.

In English, the onomatopoeia for sneezes is usually spelled &#x27;achoo&#x27; and it is similar to that of different cultures.

==Culture==

In Indian culture, especially in northern parts of India, Bengali (Bangladesh and Bengal of India) culture and also in Iran, it has been a common superstition that a sneeze taking place before the start of any work was a sign of impending bad interruption. It was thus customary to pause in order to drink water or break any work rhythm before resuming the job at hand in order to prevent any misfortune from occurring.

In Polish culture, especially in the Kresy Wschodnie borderlands, a popular belief persists that sneezes may be an inauspicious sign that, depending on the local version, either someone unspecified or one&#x27;s mother-in-law speaks ill of the person sneezing at that moment. In other regions, however, this superstition concerns hiccups rather than sneezing. As with other Catholic countries, such as Mexico, Italy, or Ireland, the remnants of pagan culture are fostered in Polish peasant idiosyncratic superstitions.

The practice among Islamic culture, in turn, has largely been based on various prophetic traditions and the teachings of Muhammad. An example of this is Al-Bukhaari&#x27;s narrations from Abu Hurayrah that Muhammad once said:
&quot;When one of you sneezes, let him say, &quot;Al-hamdu-Lillah&quot;&quot; (Praise be to God)&quot;, and let his brother or companion say to him, &quot;Yarhamuk Allah&quot;&quot; (May God have mercy on you)&quot;. If he says, &quot;Yarhamuk-Allah&quot;, then let [the sneezer] say, &quot;Yahdeekum Allah wa yuslihu baalakum&quot;&quot; (May God guide you and rectify your condition)&quot;.&quot;
=== Verbal responses ===
In English-speaking countries, one common verbal response to another person&#x27;s sneeze is &quot;[May God] bless you&quot;. Even with &quot;God&quot;, the declaration may be said by a person without religious intent. Another, less common, verbal response in the United States and Canada to another&#x27;s sneeze is &quot;Gesundheit&quot;, which is a German word that means, appropriately, &#x27;health&#x27;.

Several hypotheses exist for why the custom arose of saying &quot;bless you&quot; or &quot;God bless you&quot; in the context of sneezing:
* Some say it came into use during the plague pandemics of the 14th century. Blessing the individual after showing such a symptom was thought to prevent possible impending death due to the lethal disease.
* In Renaissance times, a superstition was formed claiming one&#x27;s heart stopped for a very brief moment during the sneeze; saying bless you was a sign of prayer that the heart would not fail.

==Sexuality==
Some people may sneeze during the initial phases of sexual arousal. Doctors suspect that the phenomenon might arise from a case of crossed wires in the autonomic nervous system, which regulates a number of functions in the body, including, but not limited to, rousing the genitals during sexual arousal. The nose, like the genitals, contains erectile tissue. This phenomenon may prepare the vomeronasal organ for increased detection of pheromones.

A sneeze has been compared to an orgasm, since both orgasms and sneeze reflexes involve tingling, bodily stretching, tension and release. On this subject, sexologist Vanessa Thompson from the University of Sydney states, &quot;Sneezing and orgasms both produce feel-good chemicals called endorphins but the amount produced by a sneeze is far less than an orgasm.&quot;

According to Dr. Holly Boyer from the University of Minnesota, there is a pleasurable effect during a sneeze, where she states, &quot;the muscle tension that builds up in your chest causes pressure, and when you sneeze and the muscles relax, it releases pressure. Anytime you release pressure, it feels good...There&#x27;s also some evidence that endorphins are released, which causes your body to feel good&quot;. Endorphins induce the brain&#x27;s reward system, and because sneezes occur in a quick burst, so does the pleasure.

== In non-humans ==

Sneezing is not confined to humans or even mammals. Many animals including cats, dogs, chickens and iguanas sneeze. African wild dogs use sneezing as a form of communication, especially when considering a consensus in a pack on whether or not to hunt. Some breeds of dog are predisposed to reverse sneezing.

<text>Putrefaction is the fifth stage of death, following pallor mortis, livor mortis, algor mortis, and rigor mortis. This process references the breaking down of a body of an animal post-mortem. In broad terms, it can be viewed as the decomposition of proteins, and the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs. This is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion, which causes the release of gases that infiltrate the body&#x27;s tissues, and leads to the deterioration of the tissues and organs. 
The approximate time it takes putrefaction to occur is dependent on various factors. Internal factors that affect the rate of putrefaction include the age at which death has occurred, the overall structure and condition of the body, the cause of death, and external injuries arising before or after death. External factors include environmental temperature, moisture and air exposure, clothing, burial factors, and light exposure. Body farms are facilities that study the way various factors affect the putrefaction process.

The first signs of putrefaction are signified by a greenish discoloration on the outside of the skin, on the abdominal wall corresponding to where the large intestine begins, as well as under the surface of the liver.

Certain substances, such as carbolic acid, arsenic, strychnine, and zinc chloride, can be used to delay the process of putrefaction in various ways based on their chemical make up.

==Description==
In thermodynamic terms, all organic tissues are composed of chemical energy, which, when not maintained by the constant biochemical maintenance of the living organism, begin to chemically break down due to the reaction with water into amino acids, known as hydrolysis. The breakdown of the proteins of a decomposing body is a spontaneous process. Protein hydrolysis is accelerated as the anaerobic bacteria of the digestive tract consume, digest, and excrete the cellular proteins of the body.

The bacterial digestion of the cellular proteins weakens the tissues of the body. As the proteins are continuously broken down to smaller components, the bacteria excrete gases and organic compounds, such as the functional-group amines putrescine (from ornithine) and cadaverine (from lysine), which carry the noxious odor of rotten flesh. Initially, the gases of putrefaction are constrained within the body cavities, but eventually diffuse through the adjacent tissues, and then into the circulatory system. Once in the blood vessels, the putrid gases infiltrate and diffuse to other parts of the body and the limbs.

The visual result of gaseous tissue-infiltration is notable bloating of the torso and limbs. The increased internal pressure of the continually rising volume of gas further stresses, weakens, and separates the tissues constraining the gas. In the course of putrefaction, the skin tissues of the body eventually rupture and release the bacterial gas. As the anaerobic bacteria continue consuming, digesting, and excreting the tissue proteins, the body&#x27;s decomposition progresses to the stage of skeletonization. This continued consumption also results in the production of ethanol by the bacteria, which can make it difficult to determine the blood alcohol content (BAC) in autopsies, particularly in bodies recovered from water.

Generally, the term &quot;decomposition&quot; encompasses the biochemical processes that occur from the physical death of the person (or animal) until the skeletonization of the body. Putrefaction is one of seven stages of decomposition; as such, the term &quot;putrescible&quot; identifies all organic matter (animal and human) that is biochemically subject to putrefaction. In the matter of death by poisoning, the putrefaction of the body is chemically delayed by poisons such as antimony, arsenic, carbolic acid (phenol), &quot;nux vomica&quot; (plant), strychnine (pesticide), and zinc chloride.

==Approximate timeline==

The rough timeline of events during the putrefaction stage is as follows:
*1–2 days: Pallor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and livor mortis are the first steps in the process of decomposition before the process of putrefaction.
*2–3 days: Discoloration appears on the skin of the abdomen. The abdomen begins to swell due to gas formation.
*3–4 days: The discoloration spreads and discolored veins become visible.
*5–6 days: The abdomen swells noticeably and the skin blisters.
*10–20 days: Black putrefaction occurs, which is when noxious odors are released from the body and the parts of the body undergo a black discoloration.
*2 weeks: The abdomen is bloated; internal gas pressure nears maximum capacity. 
*3 weeks: Tissues have softened. Organs and cavities are bursting. The nails and hair fall off.
*4 weeks: Soft tissues such as the internal organs begin to liquefy and the face becomes unrecognizable. The skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments degrade exposing the skeleton.

Order of organs&#x27; decomposition in the body:

#Larynx and trachea
#Infant brain
#Stomach
#Intestines
#Spleen
#Omentum and mesentery
#Liver
#Adult brain
#Heart
#Lungs
#Kidneys
#Bladder
#Esophagus
#Pancreas
#Diaphragm
#Blood vessels
#Uterus
The rate of putrefaction is greatest in air, followed by water, soil, and earth. The exact rate of putrefaction is dependent upon many factors such as weather, exposure and location. Thus, refrigeration at a morgue or funeral home can retard the process, allowing for burial in three days or so following death without embalming. The rate increases dramatically in tropical climates. The first external sign of putrefaction in a body lying in air is usually a greenish discoloration of the skin over the region of the cecum, which appears in 12–24 hours. The first internal sign is usually a greenish discoloration on the undersurface of the liver.

==Factors affecting putrefaction==
Various factors affect the rate of putrefaction.
===Exogenous (external)===
Environmental temperature: Decomposition is accelerated by high atmospheric or environmental temperature, with putrefaction speed optimized between and , further sped along by high levels of humidity. This optimal temperature assists in the chemical breakdown of the tissue and promotes microorganism growth. Decomposition nearly stops below or above .

Moisture and air exposure: Putrefaction is ordinarily slowed by the body being submerged in water, due to diminished exposure to air. Air exposure and moisture can both contribute to the introduction and growth of microorganisms, speeding degradation. In a hot and dry environment, the body can undergo a process called mummification where the body is completely dehydrated and bacterial decay is inhibited.

Clothing: Loose-fitting clothing can speed up the rate of putrefaction, as it helps to retain body heat. Tight-fitting clothing can delay the process by cutting off blood supply to tissues and eliminating nutrients for bacteria to feed on.

Manner of burial: Speedy burial can slow putrefaction. Bodies within deep graves tend to decompose more slowly due to the diminished influences of changes in temperature. The composition of graves can also be a significant contributing factor, with dense, clay-like soil tending to speed putrefaction while dry and sandy soil slows it.

Light exposure: Light can also contribute indirectly, as flies and insects prefer to lay eggs in areas of the body not exposed to light, such as the crevices formed by the eyelids and nostrils.

===Endogenous (internal)===
Age at time of death: Stillborn fetuses and infants putrefy slowly due to their sterility. Otherwise, however, younger people generally putrefy more quickly than older people.

Condition of the body: A body with a greater fat percentage and less lean body mass will have a faster rate of putrefaction, as fat retains more heat and it carries a larger amount of fluid in the tissues.

Cause of death: The cause of death has a direct relationship to putrefaction speed, with bodies that died from acute violence or accident generally putrefying slower than those that died from infectious diseases. Certain poisons, such as potassium cyanide or strychnine, may also delay putrefaction, while chronic alcoholism and cocaine use will speed it.

External injuries: Antemortem or postmortem injuries can speed putrefaction as injured areas can be more susceptible to invasion by bacteria.

===Delayed putrefaction===
Certain poisonous substances to the body can delay the process of putrefaction. They include:
*Carbolic acid (Phenol)
*Arsenic and antimony
*Strychnine
*Nux vomica (plant)
*Zinc chloride, ZnCl2
*Morphine
*Aconitine

===Embalming===
Embalming is the process of preserving human remains by delaying decomposition. This is acquired through the use of embalming fluid, which is a mixture of formaldehyde, methanol, and various other solvents. The most common reasons to preserve the body are for viewing purposes at a funeral, for above-ground interment or distant transportation of the deceased, and for medical or religious practices.

==Research==
Body farms subject donated cadavers to various environmental conditions to study the process of human decomposition. These include The University of Tennessee&#x27;s Forensic Anthropologic Facility, Western Carolina Universities Osteology Research Station (FOREST), Texas State University&#x27;s Forensic Anthropology Research Facility (FARF), Sam Houston State University&#x27;s Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility (STAFS), Southern Illinois University&#x27;s Complex for Forensic Anthropology Research, and Colorado Mesa University&#x27;s Forensic Investigation Research Station. The Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research, near Sydney, is the first body farm located outside of the United States In the United Kingdom there are several facilities which, instead of using human remains or cadavers, use dead pigs to study the decomposition process. Pigs are less likely to have infectious diseases than human cadavers, and are more readily available without any concern for ethical issues, but a human body farm is still highly sought after for further research. Each body farm is unique in its environmental make-up, giving researchers a broader knowledge, and allowing research into how different environmental factors can affect the rate of decomposition significantly such as humidity, sun exposure, rain or snow, altitude level and more.

==Other uses==

In alchemy, putrefaction is the same as fermentation, whereby a substance is allowed to rot or decompose undisturbed. In some cases, the commencement of the process is facilitated with a small sample of the desired material to act as a &quot;seed&quot;, a technique akin to the use of a seed crystal in crystallization.

<text>Medical anthropology studies &quot;human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation&quot;. It views humans from multidimensional and ecological perspectives. It is one of the most highly developed areas of anthropology and applied anthropology, and is a subfield of social and cultural anthropology that examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or influenced by issues of health, health care and related issues.

The term &quot;medical anthropology&quot; has been used since 1963 as a label for empirical research and theoretical production by anthropologists into the social processes and cultural representations of health, illness and the nursing/care practices associated with these.

Furthermore, in Europe the terms &quot;anthropology of medicine&quot;, &quot;anthropology of health&quot; and &quot;anthropology of illness&quot; have also been used, and &quot;medical anthropology&quot;, was also a translation of the 19th century Dutch term &quot;medische anthropologie&quot;. This term was chosen by some authors during the 1940s to refer to philosophical studies on health and illness.

==Historical background==
The relationship between anthropology, &quot;medicine&quot; and medical practice is well documented. General anthropology occupied a notable position in the basic medical sciences (which correspond to those subjects commonly known as pre-clinical). However, medical education started to be restricted to the confines of the hospital as a consequence of the development of the clinical gaze and the confinement of patients in observational infirmaries. The hegemony of hospital clinical education and of experimental methodologies suggested by Claude Bernard relegate the value of the practitioners&#x27; everyday experience, which was previously seen as a source of knowledge represented by the reports called &quot;medical geographies&quot; and &quot;medical topographies&quot; both based on ethnographic, demographic, statistical and sometimes epidemiological data. After the development of hospital clinical training the basic source of knowledge in medicine was experimental medicine in the hospital and laboratory, and these factors together meant that over time mostly doctors abandoned ethnography as a tool of knowledge. Most, not all because ethnography remained during a large part of the 20th century as a tool of knowledge in primary health care, rural medicine, and in international public health. The abandonment of ethnography by medicine happened when social anthropology adopted ethnography as one of the markers of its professional identity and started to depart from the initial project of general anthropology. The divergence of professional anthropology from medicine was never a complete split. The relationships between the two disciplines remained constant during the 20th century, until the development of modern medical anthropology in the 1960s and 1970s. A book by Saillant &amp; Genest describes development of medical anthropology as a field of study, and some of the main theoretical and intellectual actual debates.

Some popular topics that are covered by medical anthropology are mental health, sexual health, pregnancy and birth, aging, addiction, nutrition, disabilities, infectious disease, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), global epidemics and disaster management.

== Medical sociology ==
Peter Conrad notes that medical sociology studies some of the same phenomena as medical anthropology but argues that medical anthropology has different origins, originally studying medicine within non-western cultures and using different methodologies. He argues that there was some convergence between the disciplines, as medical sociology started to adopt some of the methodologies of anthropology such as qualitative research and began to focus more on the patient, and medical anthropology started to focus on western medicine. He argued that more interdisciplinary communication could improve both disciplines.

==Popular medicine and medical systems==
For much of the 20th century, the concept of &quot;popular medicine&quot;, or &quot;folk medicine&quot;, has been familiar to both doctors and anthropologists. Doctors, anthropologists, and medical anthropologists used these terms to describe the resources, other than the help of health professionals, which European or Latin American peasants used to resolve health issues. The term was also used to describe the health practices of indigenous groups in different parts around the world, with particular emphasis on their ethnobotanical knowledge. This knowledge is fundamental for isolating alkaloids and active pharmacological principles. Furthermore, studying the rituals surrounding popular therapies served to challenge Western psychopathological categories, as well as the relationship in the West between science and religion. Doctors were not trying to turn popular medicine into an anthropological concept, rather they wanted to construct a scientifically based medical concept which they could use to establish the cultural limits of biomedicine. Biomedicine is the application of natural sciences and biology to the diagnosis of a disease. Often in the Western culture, this is ethnomedicine. Examples of this practice can be found in medical archives and oral history projects.

The concept of &quot;folk medicine&quot; was taken up by professional anthropologists in the first half of the twentieth century to demarcate between &quot;magical practices&quot;, &quot;medicine&quot; and &quot;religion&quot; and to explore the role and the significance of &quot;popular healers&quot; and their self-medicating practices. For them, popular medicine was a specific cultural feature of some groups of humans which was distinct from the universal practices of biomedicine. If every culture had its own specific popular medicine based on its general cultural features, it would be possible to propose the existence of as many medical systems as there were cultures and, therefore, develop the comparative study of these systems. Those medical systems which showed none of the syncretic features of European popular medicine were called primitive or pretechnical medicine according to whether they referred to contemporary aboriginal cultures or to cultures predating Classical Greece. Those cultures with a documentary corpus, such as the Tibetan, traditional Chinese or Ayurvedic cultures, were sometimes called &quot;systematic medicines&quot;. The comparative study of medical systems is known as ethnomedicine, which is the way an illness or disease is treated in one&#x27;s culture, or, if psychopathology is the object of study, ethnopsychiatry (Beneduce 2007, 2008), transcultural psychiatry (Bibeau, 1997) and anthropology of mental illness (Lézé, 2014).

Under this concept, medical systems would be seen as the specific product of each ethnic group&#x27;s cultural history. Scientific biomedicine would become another medical system and therefore a cultural form that could be studied as such. This position, which originated in the cultural relativism maintained by cultural anthropology, allowed the debate with medicine and psychiatry to revolve around some fundamental questions:

# The relative influence of genotypical and phenotypical factors in relation to personality and certain forms of pathology, especially psychiatric and psychosomatic pathologies.
# The influence of culture on what a society considers to be normal, pathological or abnormal.
# The verification in different cultures of the universality of the nosological categories of biomedicine and psychiatry.
# The identification and description of diseases belonging to specific cultures that have not been previously described by clinical medicine. These are known as ethnic disorders and, more recently, as culture-bound syndromes, and include the evil eye and tarantism among European peasants, being possessed or in a state of trance in many cultures, and nervous anorexia, nerves and premenstrual syndrome in Western societies.

Since the end of the 20th century, medical anthropologists have had a much more sophisticated understanding of the problem of cultural representations and social practices related to health, disease and medical care and attention. These have been understood as being universal with very diverse local forms articulated in transactional processes. The link at the end of this page is included to offer a wide panorama of current positions in medical anthropology.

==Applied medical anthropology==

In the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil, collaboration between anthropology and medicine was initially concerned with implementing community health programs among ethnic and cultural minorities and with the qualitative and ethnographic evaluation of health institutions (hospitals and mental hospitals) and primary care services. Regarding the community health programs, the intention was to resolve the problems of establishing these services for a complex mosaic of ethnic groups. The ethnographic evaluation involved analyzing the interclass conflicts within the institutions which had an undesirable effect on their administrative reorganization and their institutional objectives, particularly those conflicts among the doctors, nurses, auxiliary staff and administrative staff. The ethnographic reports show that interclass crises directly affected therapeutic criteria and care of the ill. They also contributed new methodological criteria for evaluating the new institutions resulting from the reforms as well as experimental care techniques such as therapeutic communities.

The ethnographic evidence supported the criticisms of the institutional custodialism and contributed decisively to policies of deinstitutionalizing psychiatric and social care in general and led to in some countries such as Italy, a rethink of the guidelines on education and promoting health.

The empirical answers to these questions led to the anthropologists being involved in many areas. These include: developing international and community health programs in developing countries; evaluating the influence of social and cultural variables in the epidemiology of certain forms of psychiatric pathology (transcultural psychiatry); studying cultural resistance to innovation in therapeutic and care practices; analysing healing practices toward immigrants; and studying traditional healers, folk healers and empirical midwives who may be reinvented as health workers (the so-called barefoot doctors).

Also, since the 1960s, biomedicine in developed countries has been faced by a series of problems which stipulate inspection of predisposing social or cultural factors, which have been reduced to variables in quantitative protocols and subordinated to causal biological or genetic interpretations. Among these the following are of particular note:
a) The transition between a dominant system designed for acute infectious pathology to a system designed for chronic degenerative pathology without any specific etiological therapy.

b) The emergence of the need to develop long term treatment mechanisms and strategies, as opposed to incisive therapeutic treatments.

c) The influence of concepts such as quality of life in relation to classic biomedical therapeutic criteria.
Added to these are the problems associated with implementing community health mechanisms. These problems are perceived initially as tools for fighting against unequal access to health services. However, once a comprehensive service is available to the public, new problems emerge from ethnic, cultural or religious differences, or from differences between age groups, genders or social classes.

If implementing community care mechanisms gives rise to one set of problems, then a whole new set of problems also arises when these same mechanisms are dismantled and the responsibilities which they once assumed are placed back on the shoulders of individual members of society.

In all these fields, local and qualitative ethnographic research is indispensable for understanding the way patients and their social networks incorporate knowledge on health and illness when their experience is nuanced by complex cultural influences. These influences result from the nature of social relations in advanced societies and from the influence of social communication media, especially audiovisual media and advertising.

==Fields==
As medical anthropology has not standardised, consistent fields have not been established. In general, we may consider the following six basic fields:

* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
*the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings

Other subjects that have become central to the medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as &quot;cultural psychiatry&quot; and &quot;transcultural psychiatry&quot; or &quot;ethnopsychiatry&quot;.

==Training==
All medical anthropologists are trained in anthropology as their main discipline. Many come from the health professions such as medicine or nursing, whereas others come from the other backgrounds such as psychology, social work, social education or sociology. Cultural and transcultural psychiatrists are trained as anthropologists and, naturally, psychiatric clinicians. Training in medical anthropology is normally acquired at a master&#x27;s (M.A. or M.Sc.) and doctoral level. A fairly comprehensive account of different postgraduate training courses in different countries can be found on the website of the &quot;Society of Medical Anthropology&quot; of the &quot;American Anthropological Association&quot;.

<doc id="232417" wikidata="Q1210343" url="?curid=232417" title="Dictionary of National Biography">
<text>The Dictionary of National Biography (DNB) is a standard work of reference on notable figures from British history, published since 1885. The updated Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) was published on 23 September 2004 in 60 volumes and online, with 50,113 biographical articles covering 54,922 lives.

==First series==
Hoping to emulate national biographical collections published elsewhere in Europe, such as the (1875), in 1882 the publisher George Smith (1824–1901), of Smith, Elder &amp; Co., planned a universal dictionary that would include biographical entries on individuals from world history. He approached Leslie Stephen, then editor of the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, owned by Smith, to become the editor. Stephen persuaded Smith that the work should focus only on subjects from the United Kingdom and its present and former colonies. An early working title was the &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot;, the name of an earlier eighteenth-century reference work.

The first volume of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; appeared on 1 January 1885. In May 1891 Leslie Stephen resigned and Sidney Lee, Stephen&#x27;s assistant editor from the beginning of the project, succeeded him as editor. A dedicated team of sub-editors and researchers worked under Stephen and Lee, combining a variety of talents from veteran journalists to young scholars who cut their academic teeth on dictionary articles at a time when postgraduate historical research in British universities was still in its infancy. While much of the dictionary was written in-house, the &quot;DNB&quot; also relied on external contributors, who included several respected writers and scholars of the late nineteenth century. By 1900, more than 700 individuals had contributed to the work. Successive volumes appeared quarterly with complete punctuality until midsummer 1900, when the series closed with volume 63. The year of publication, the editor and the range of names in each volume is given below.

==Supplements and revisions==
Since the scope included only deceased figures, the &quot;DNB&quot; was soon extended by the issue of three supplementary volumes, covering subjects who had died between 1885 and 1900 or who had been overlooked in the original alphabetical sequence. The supplements brought the whole work up to the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901. Corrections were added.

After issuing a volume of errata in 1904, the dictionary was reissued with minor revisions in 22 volumes in 1908 and 1909; a subtitle said that it covered British history &quot;from the earliest times to the year 1900&quot;. In the words of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;, the dictionary had &quot;proved of inestimable service in elucidating the private annals of the British&quot;, providing not only concise lives of the notable deceased, but additionally lists of sources which were invaluable to researchers in a period when few libraries or collections of manuscripts had published catalogues or indices, and the production of indices to periodical literatures was just beginning. Throughout the twentieth century, further volumes were published for those who had died, generally on a decade-by-decade basis, beginning in 1912 with a supplement edited by Lee covering those who died between 1901 and 1911. The dictionary was transferred from its original publishers, Smith, Elder &amp; Co., to Oxford University Press in 1917. Until 1996, Oxford University Press continued to add further supplements featuring articles on subjects who had died during the twentieth century. These include the 3rd supplement in 1927 (covering those who died between 1912 and 1921), 4th supplement in 1937 (covering those who died between 1922 and 1930), 5th supplement in 1949 (covering those who died between 1931 and 1940), 6th supplement in 1959 (covering those who died between 1941 and 1950), 7th supplement in 1971 (covering those who died between 1951 and 1960), 8th supplement in 1981 (covering those who died between 1961 and 1970), 9th supplement in 1986 (covering those who died between 1971 and 1980), 10th supplement in 1990 (covering those who died between 1981 and 1985), 11th supplement in 1993 (covering missing persons, see below), and 12th supplement in 1996 (covering those who died between 1986 and 1990).

The 63 volumes of the original &quot;DNB&quot; included 29,120 lives; the supplements published between 1912 and 1996 added about 6,000 lives of people who died in the twentieth century. In 1993, a volume containing missing biographies was published. This had an additional 1,086 lives, selected from over 100,000 suggestions.

L. G. L. Legg was editor of the &quot;DNB&quot; in the 1940s.

In 1966, the University of London published a volume of corrections, cumulated from the &quot;Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research&quot;.

==Concise dictionary==
There were various versions of the &quot;Concise Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, which covered everyone in the main work but with much shorter articles; some were only two lines. The last edition, in three volumes, covered everyone who died before 1986.

==&quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;==
In the early 1990s, Oxford University Press committed itself to overhauling the &quot;DNB&quot;. Work on what was known until 2001 as the &quot;New Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, or &quot;New DNB&quot;, began in 1992 under the editorship of Colin Matthew, professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Matthew decided that no subjects from the old dictionary would be excluded, however insignificant the subjects appeared to a late twentieth-century eye; that a minority of shorter articles from the original dictionary would remain in the new version in revised form, but most would be rewritten; and that room would be made for about 14,000 new subjects. Suggestions for new subjects were solicited through questionnaires placed in libraries and universities and, as the 1990s advanced, online. The suggestions were assessed by the editor, the 12 external consultant editors, and several hundred associate editors and in-house staff. Digitisation of the &quot;DNB&quot; was performed by the Alliance Photosetting Company in Pondicherry, India.

The new dictionary would cover British history, &quot;broadly defined&quot; (including, for example, subjects from Roman Britain, the United States of America before its independence, and from Britain&#x27;s former colonies, provided they were functionally part of the Empire and not of &quot;the indigenous culture&quot;, as stated in the Introduction), up to 31 December 2000. The research project was conceived as a collaborative one, with in-house staff co-ordinating the work of nearly 10,000 contributors internationally. It would remain selective – there would be no attempt to include all members of parliament, for example – but would seek to include significant, influential or notorious figures from the whole canvas of the life of the United Kingdom and its former colonies, overlaying the decisions of the late-nineteenth-century editors with the interests of late-twentieth-century scholarship in the hope that &quot;the two epochs in collaboration might produce something more useful for the future than either epoch on its own&quot;, but acknowledging also that a final definitive selection is impossible to achieve.

Matthew&#x27;s dedication to a digitised ODNB included what Christopher Warren calls Matthew&#x27;s &quot;data internationalism&quot;. In a 1996 essay, Matthew prophesied, &quot;Who can doubt that in the course of the next century, as nationality in Europe gives way to European Union, so national reference works, at least in Europe, will do so also...Just as the computer is collapsing national library catalogues in a single world-wide series, so I am sure that in the course of the next fifty years we will see the gradual aggregation of our various dictionaries of national biography. We will be much blamed by our users if we do not!&quot;

Following Matthew&#x27;s death in October 1999, he was succeeded as editor by another Oxford historian, Brian Harrison, in January 2000. The new dictionary, now known as the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (or &quot;ODNB&quot;), was published on 23 September 2004 in 60 volumes in print at a price of £7,500, and in an online edition for subscribers. Most UK holders of a current library card can access it online free of charge. In subsequent years, the print edition has been obtainable new for a much lower price. At publication, the 2004 edition had 50,113 biographical articles covering 54,922 lives, including entries on all subjects included in the old &quot;DNB&quot; (the old &quot;DNB&quot; entries on these subjects may be accessed separately through a link to the &quot;DNB Archive&quot; – many of the longer entries are still highly regarded). A small permanent staff remain in Oxford to update and extend the coverage of the online edition. Harrison was succeeded as editor by another Oxford historian, Lawrence Goldman, in October 2004. The first online update was published on 4 January 2005, including subjects who had died in 2001. A further update, including subjects from all periods, followed on 23 May 2005, and another on 6 October 2005. New subjects who died in 2002 were added to the online dictionary on 5 January 2006, with continuing releases in May and October in subsequent years following the precedent of 2005. The &quot;ODNB&quot; also includes some new biographies on people who died before the &quot;DNB&quot; was published and are not included in the original &quot;DNB&quot;, because they have become notable since the &quot;DNB&quot; was published through the work of more recent historians, for example William Eyre (fl. 1634–1675).

The online version has an advanced search facility, allowing a search for people by area of interest, religion and &quot;Places, Dates, Life Events&quot;. This accesses an electronic index that cannot be directly viewed.

Response to the new dictionary has been for the most part positive, but in the months following publication there was occasional criticism of the dictionary in some British newspapers and periodicals for reported factual inaccuracies. However, the number of articles publicly queried in this way was small – only 23 of the 50,113 articles published in September 2004, leading to fewer than 100 substantiated factual amendments. These and other queries received since publication are being considered as part of an ongoing programme of assessing proposed corrections or additions to existing subject articles, which can, when approved, be incorporated into the online edition of the dictionary. In 2005, The American Library Association awarded the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; its prestigious Dartmouth Medal. A general review of the dictionary was published in 2007.

Sir David Cannadine took over the editorship from October 2014.

<text>&#x27; (; ), also known as &#x27; (), and  (), is a form of , Chinese robe, which was derived from the Qing dynasty , the traditional dress of the Manchu people, which were worn by Manchu men. The was actually developed by the Han Chinese through the modification of their own Ming dynasty&#x27;s by adopting some Manchu men&#x27;s clothing elements in one of their . In function, the is considered the male equivalent of the women&#x27;s &quot;cheongsam&quot; (also known as &quot;&quot;). The was often worn by men with a , also commonly translated as &quot;riding jacket&quot; in English language.

== Terminology ==

=== General term ===
The term is composed of two Chinese characters: 《》which can literally be translated as &quot;long&quot; in length and 《》, which literally means &quot;shirt&quot;. The term is also composed of the Chinese character and the Chinese 《》, which is literally means &quot;robe&quot;. As general terms used in the broad sense, the and can refer to any form of long shirt and long robes respectively.

=== Specific term ===
The Mandarin Chinese word is cognate with the Cantonese term codice_1 ()&quot;.&quot; This was then borrowed into English as &quot;cheongsam.&quot;

Unlike the Mandarin term, however, the can refer to both male and female garments. In Hong Kong the term is frequently used to refer to the female garment, cheongsam, rather than the male garment &quot;.&quot;

Because of the long British presence in Hong Kong, that local usage has become reflected in the meaning of &quot;cheongsam&quot; in English, which refers exclusively to the female garment.

== Origins and development ==

What is now known as the Chinese was developed by the Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty. The Qing dynasty Chinese started to be worn by the Han Chinese after the Manchu conquest. The Chinese was actually a modified version of the worn in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD), the preceding dynasty before the Qing dynasty, and was modelled after the Manchu&#x27;s men&#x27;s . 

Manchu men wore a type of which reflected its equestrian origins, which was originally designed for horseback riding, known as , which was characterized by two pair of slits (one slit on each side, one slit on the back, and one slit on the front) which increased ease of movement when mounting and dismounting horses, a collar (a collar which curved like the alphabet《S》), and the sleeve cuffs known as ().

The Han Chinese thus adopted certain Manchu elements when modifying their Ming dynasty , such as by slimming their , by adopting the collar of the Manchu, and by using buttons and loops at the neck and sides. Despite the shared similarities with Manchu&#x27;s , the Chinese differed structurally from the Manchu&#x27;s . The Chinese only has two slits on the sides lacking the central front and back slits and lacked the presence of the cuffs; the sleeves were also longer than the ones found in the .

==History==
The precursors of both the &quot;changshan&quot; and the &quot;qipao&quot; were introduced to China during the Qing dynasty (17th–20th centuries). The Manchus in 1636 ordered that all Han Chinese should adopt the Manchu&#x27;s hairstyle as well as their attire of dress or face harsh punishment including death penalty. However, by the time of the Qianlong Emperor, however, the adoption of Manchu clothing dressing code was only required to the scholar-official elites and did not apply to the entire male population.&quot;&quot; The court dress of the Qing dynasty also had to follow the attire of the Manchu people;&quot;&quot; however, commoner Han men and women were still allowed to wear the &quot;hanfu&quot; under some circumstances and/or if they fell under the exemptions of the Tifayifu policy. The order of wearing Manchu&#x27;s hairstyle however still remained as a fundamental rule for all Chinese men.&quot;&quot;

Over time, the commoner Han men adopted the &quot;changshan&quot; while Han women continued to the wear the hanfu predominantly in the style of aoqun. The traditional Chinese Hanfu-style of clothing for men was gradually replaced. Over time, the Manchu-style of male dress gained popularity among Han men.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Changshan&quot; was considered formal dress for Chinese men before Western-style suits were widely adopted in China. The male &quot;changshan&quot; could be worn under a western overcoat, and topped with a fedora and scarf. This combination expressed an East Asian modernity in the early 20th century.

The 1949 Communist Revolution replaced the wearing of &quot;changshan&quot; and other traditional clothing with the Zhongshan suit. Shanghainese emigrants and refugees carried the fashion to Hong Kong, where it remained popular, but over time it was overtaken by western fashions. After the 1970s, Shanghai and elsewhere in mainland China, many people have revived wearing the Shanghainese &quot;changshan.&quot;

==Use of changshan==

&quot;Changshan&quot; are traditionally worn for formal pictures, weddings, and other formal Chinese events. A black &quot;changshan,&quot; along with a rounded black hat, was, and sometimes still is, the burial attire for Chinese men. &quot;Changshan&quot; are not often worn in mainland China, except during traditional Chinese celebrations but, with the revival of some traditional clothing in urban mainland China, the Shanghainese style functions as a stylish party dress (&quot;cf.&quot; Mao suit).

<doc id="232423" wikidata="Q17157038" url="?curid=232423" title="Reification (computer science)">
<text>In computer science, reification is the process by which an abstract idea about a program is turned into an explicit data model or other object created in a programming language. A computable/addressable object—a &quot;resource&quot;—is created in a system as a proxy for a non computable/addressable object. By means of reification, something that was previously implicit, unexpressed, and possibly inexpressible is explicitly formulated and made available to conceptual (logical or computational) manipulation. Informally, reification is often referred to as &quot;making something a first-class citizen&quot; within the scope of a particular system. Some aspect of a system can be reified at &quot;language design time&quot;, which is related to reflection in programming languages. It can be applied as a stepwise refinement at &quot;system design time&quot;. Reification is one of the most frequently used techniques of conceptual analysis and knowledge representation.

== Reflective programming languages ==
In the context of programming languages, reification is the process by which a user program or any aspect of a programming language that was implicit in the translated program and the run-time system, are expressed in the language itself. This process makes it available to the program, which can inspect all these aspects as ordinary data. In reflective languages, reification data is causally connected to the related reified aspect such that a modification to one of them affects the other. Therefore, the reification data is always a faithful representation of the related reified aspect . Reification data is often said to be made a first class object. Reification, at least partially, has been experienced in many languages to date: in early Lisp dialects and in current Prolog dialects, programs have been treated as data, although the causal connection has often been left to the responsibility of the programmer. In Smalltalk-80, the compiler from the source text to bytecode has been part of the run-time system since the very first implementations of the language.

* The C programming language reifies the low-level detail of memory addresses.Many programming language designs encapsulate the details of memory allocation in the compiler and the run-time system. In the design of the C programming language, the memory address is reified and is available for direct manipulation by other language constructs. For example, the following code may be used when implementing a memory-mapped device driver. The buffer pointer is a proxy for the memory address 0xB8000000.
 char* buffer = (char*) 0xB8000000;
 buffer[0] = 10; 

* Functional programming languages based on lambda-calculus reify the concept of a procedure abstraction and procedure application in the form of the Lambda expression.
* The Scheme programming language reifies continuations (approximately, the call stack).
* In C#, reification is used to make parametric polymorphism implemented in the form of generics as a first-class feature of the language.
* In the Java programming language, there exist &quot;reifiable types&quot; that are &quot;completely available at run time&quot; (i.e. their information is not erased during compilation).
* REBOL reifies code as data and vice versa.
* Many languages, such as Lisp, JavaScript, and Curl, provide an codice_1 or codice_2 procedure that effectively reifies the language interpreter.
* The Logtalk framework for Prolog offers a means to explore reification in the context of logic programming.
* Smalltalk and Actor languages permit the reification of blocks and messages, which are equivalent of lambda expressions in Lisp, and codice_3 in Smalltalk, which is a reification of the current executing block.
* Homoiconic languages reify the syntax of the language itself in the form of an abstract syntax tree, typically together with codice_1.

== Data reification vs. data refinement ==
Data reification (stepwise refinement) involves finding a more concrete representation of the abstract data types used in a formal specification.

Data reification is the terminology of the Vienna Development Method (VDM) that most other people would call data refinement. An example is taking a step towards an implementation by replacing a data representation without a counterpart in the intended implementation language, such as sets, by one that does have a counterpart (such as maps with fixed domains that can be implemented by arrays), or at least one that is closer to having a counterpart, such as sequences. The VDM community prefers the word &quot;reification&quot; over &quot;refinement&quot;, as the process has more to do with concretising an idea than with refining it.

For similar usages, see Reification (linguistics).

== In conceptual modeling ==
Reification is widely used in conceptual modeling. Reifying a relationship means viewing it as an entity. The purpose of reifying a relationship is to make it explicit, when additional information needs to be added to it. Consider the relationship type &quot;codice_5&quot;. An instance of &quot;codice_6&quot; is a relationship that represents the fact that a person is a member of a committee. The figure below shows an example population of &quot;codice_6&quot; relationship in tabular form. Person &quot;P1&quot; is a member of committees &quot;C1&quot; and &quot;C2&quot;. Person &quot;P2&quot; is a member of committee &quot;C1&quot; only. 

The same fact, however, could also be viewed as an entity. Viewing a relationship as an entity, one can say that the entity reifies the relationship. This is called reification of a relationship. Like any other entity, it must be an instance of an entity type. In the present example, the entity type has been named codice_8. For each instance of &quot;codice_6&quot;, there is one and only one instance of &quot;codice_8&quot;, and vice versa. Now, it becomes possible to add more information to the original relationship. As an example, we can express the fact that &quot;person p1 was nominated to be the member of committee c1 by person p2&quot;. Reified relationship &quot;codice_8&quot; can be used as the source of a new relationship &quot;codice_12&quot;.

For related usages see Reification (knowledge representation).

== In Unified Modeling Language (UML) ==
 UML provides an &quot;association class&quot; construct for defining reified relationship types. The association class is a single model element that is both a kind of association and a kind of class. 
The association and the entity type that reifies are both the same model element. Note that attributes cannot be reified.

== On Semantic Web ==

=== RDF and OWL ===
In Semantic Web languages, such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL), a statement is a binary relation. It is used to link two individuals or an individual and a value. Applications sometimes need to describe other RDF statements, for instance, to record information like when statements were made, or who made them, which is sometimes called &quot;provenance&quot; information. As an example, we may want to represent properties of a relation, such as our certainty about it, severity or strength of a relation, relevance of a relation, and so on.

The example from the conceptual modeling section describes a particular person with codice_13, who is a member of the codice_14. The RDF triple from that description is

 person:p1 committee:isMemberOf committee:c1 .

Consider to store two further facts: (i) to record who nominated this particular person to this committee (a statement about the membership itself), and (ii) to record who added the fact to the database (a statement about the statement).

The first case is a case of classical reification like above in UML: reify the membership and store its attributes and roles etc.:
 committee:Membership rdf:type owl:Class .
 committee:membership12345 rdf:type committee:Membership .
 committee:membership12345 committee:ofPerson person:p1 .
 committee:membership12345 committee:inCommittee committee:c1 .
 person:p2 committee:nominated committee:membership12345 . 
Additionally, RDF provides a built-in vocabulary intended for describing RDF statements. A description of a statement using this vocabulary is called a reification of the statement. The RDF reification vocabulary consists of the type codice_15, and the properties codice_16, codice_17, and codice_18.

Using the reification vocabulary, a reification of the statement about the person&#x27;s membership would be given by assigning the statement a URIref such as codice_19 so that describing statements can be written as follows:

 committee:membership12345Stat rdf:type rdf:Statement .
 committee:membership12345Stat rdf:subject person:p1 .
 committee:membership12345Stat rdf:predicate committee:isMemberOf . 
 committee:membership12345Stat rdf:object committee:c1 .

These statements say that the resource identified by the codice_20 is an RDF statement, that the subject of the statement refers to the resource identified by codice_21, the predicate of the statement refers to the resource identified by codice_22, and the object of the statement refers to the resource codice_14. Assuming that the original statement is actually identified by codice_19, it should be clear by comparing the original statement with the reification that the reification actually does describe it. The conventional use of the RDF reification vocabulary always involves describing a statement using four statements in this pattern. Therefore, they are sometimes referred to as the &quot;reification quad&quot;.

Using reification according to this convention, we could record the fact that codice_25 added the statement to the
database by

 person:p3 committee:addedToDatabase committee:membership12345Stat .

It is important to note that in the conventional use of reification, the subject of the reification triples is assumed to identify a particular instance of a triple in a particular RDF document, rather than some arbitrary triple having the same subject, predicate, and object. This particular convention is used because reification is intended for expressing properties such as dates of composition and source information, as in the examples given already, and these properties need to be applied to specific instances of triples. 
Note that the described triple codice_26 itself is not implied by such a reification quad (and it is not necessary that it actually exists in the database). This allows also to use this mechanism to express which triples do &quot;not&quot; hold.

The power of the reification vocabulary in RDF is restricted by the lack of a built-in means for assigning URIrefs to statements, so in order to express &quot;provenance&quot; information of this kind in RDF, one has to use some mechanism (outside of RDF) to assign URIs to individual RDF statements, then make further statements about those individual statements, using their URIs to identify them.

=== In Topic Maps ===
In an XML Topic Map (XTM), only a topic can have a name or play a role in an association. One may use an association to make an assertion about a topic, but one cannot directly make assertions about that assertion. However, it is possible to create a topic that reifies a non-topic construct in a map, thus enabling the association to be named and treated as a topic itself.

=== &quot;n&quot;-ary relations ===
In Semantic Web languages, such as RDF and OWL, a property is a binary relation used to link two individuals or an individual and a value. However, in some cases, the natural and convenient way to represent certain concepts is to use relations to link an individual to more than just one individual or value. These relations are called n-ary relations. Examples are representing relations among multiple individuals, such as a committee, a person who is a committee member and another person who has nominated the first person to become the committee member, or a buyer, a seller, and an object that was bought when describing a purchase of a book.

A more general approach to reification is to create an explicit new class and n new properties to represent an &quot;n&quot;-ary relation, making an instance of the relation linking the individuals an instance of this class. This approach can also be used to represent provenance information and other properties for an individual relation instance.

 :p1
 a :Person ;
 :has_membership _:membership_12345 .
 _:membership_12345
 a :Membership ;
 :committee :c1;
 :nominated_by :p2 .
=== Vs. quotation ===
It is also important to note that the reification described here is not the same as &quot;quotation&quot; found in other languages. Instead, the reification describes the relationship between a particular instance of a triple and the resources the triple refers to. The reification can be read intuitively as saying &quot;this RDF triple talks about these things&quot;, rather than (as in quotation) &quot;this RDF triple has this form.&quot; For instance, in the reification example used in this section, the triple:

 committee:membership12345 rdf:subject person:p1 .

describing the codice_16 of the original statement says that the subject of the statement is the resource (the person) identified by the URIref codice_21. It does not state that the subject of the statement is the URIref itself (i.e., a string beginning with certain characters), as quotation would.

<doc id="232426" wikidata="Q13582682" url="?curid=232426" title="Classification">
<text>Classification is the activity of assigning objects to some pre-existing classes or categories. This is distinct from the task of establishing the classes themselves (for example through cluster analysis). Examples include diagnostic tests, identifying spam emails and deciding whether to give someone a driving license. 

As well as &#x27;category&#x27;, synonyms or near-synonyms for &#x27;class&#x27; include &#x27;type&#x27;, &#x27;species&#x27;, &#x27;order&#x27;, &#x27;concept&#x27;, &#x27;taxon&#x27;, &#x27;group&#x27;, &#x27;identification&#x27; and &#x27;division&#x27;. 

The meaning of the word &#x27;classification&#x27; (and its synonyms) may take on one of several related meanings. It may encompass both classification and the creation of classes, as for example in &#x27;the task of categorizing pages in Wikipedia&#x27;; this overall activity is listed under taxonomy. It may refer exclusively to the underlying scheme of classes (which otherwise may be called a taxonomy). Or it may refer to the label given to an object by the classifier.

Classification is a part of many different kinds of activities and is studied from many different points of view including medicine, philosophy, law, anthropology, biology, taxonomy, cognition, communications, knowledge organization, psychology, statistics, machine learning, economics and mathematics.

==Binary vs multi-class classification==
Methodological work aimed at improving the accuracy of a classifier is commonly divided between cases where there are exactly two classes (binary classification) and cases where there are three or more classes (multiclass classification). Another distinction is between categorical classification, which disregards the inherent ordering of classes, and ordinal classification, which considers and preserves the natural order of the classes.

== Evaluation of accuracy ==
Unlike in decision theory, it is assumed that a classifier repeats the classification task over and over. And unlike a lottery, it is assumed that each classification can be either right or wrong; in the theory of measurement, classification is understood as measurement against a nominal scale. Thus it is possible to try to measure the accuracy of a classifier.

Measuring the accuracy of a classifier allows a choice to be made between two alternative classifiers. This is important both when developing a classifier and in choosing which classifier to deploy. There are however many different methods for evaluating the accuracy of a classifier and no general method for determining which method should be used in which circumstances. Different fields have taken different approaches, even in binary classification. In pattern recognition, error rate is popular. The Gini coefficient and KS statistic are widely used in the credit scoring industry. Sensitivity and specificity are widely used in epidemiology and medicine. Precision and recall are widely used in information retrieval.

Classifier accuracy depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems (a phenomenon that may be explained by the no-free-lunch theorem).

<doc id="232428" wikidata="Q1936750" url="?curid=232428" title="Cruelty">
<text>Cruelty is the intentional infliction of suffering or the inaction towards another&#x27;s suffering when a clear remedy is readily available. Sadism can also be related to this form of action or concept. Cruel ways of inflicting suffering may involve violence, but affirmative violence is not necessary for an act to be cruel.

==Etymology==
The term comes from Middle English, via the Old French term &quot;crualte&quot;, which is based on Latin &quot;crudelitas&quot;, from &quot;crudelis&quot;.

The word has metaphorical uses, for example, &quot;The cliffs remained cruel.&quot; (i.e., unclimbable when they desperately needed to be climbed) in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

==Usage in law==
The term &quot;cruelty&quot; is often used in law and criminology with regard to the treatment of animals, children, spouses, and prisoners. When cruelty to animals is discussed, it often refers to &quot;unnecessary suffering.&quot; In criminal law, it refers to punishment, torture, victimization, , and cruel and unusual punishment. In divorce cases, many jurisdictions permit a cause of action for cruel and inhumane treatment.

In law, cruelty is &quot;the infliction of physical or mental distress, especially when considered a determinant in granting a divorce.&quot; According to Barozzo, there are four distinct conceptions of cruelty in criminal law. “The differences between these conceptions of cruelty rest on the types of agency, victimization, causality, and values that they employ.”

The first is the agent-objective conception, which is “exemplified by […] agency that goes above in degree and beyond in type the [suffering] allowed by applicable norms.” Under this conception, the victim suffered cruelty in light of “the objective character of the act or treatment” she was subjected to. Cruelty, in this sense, is defined as an “inclination of the mind toward the side of harshness”. Any punishment or other treatment that surpasses the scope of sufficiency and ventures into possibility is classified as excessive, and therefore, cruel.

The second conception is agent-subjective, in which “cruelty obtains only when the agent&#x27;s deviant behavior is accompanied by the fault of character consisting in deriving personal delight from causing and witnessing suffering”. This conception is best understood under the presumption that punishment or other violence is a means to restore the offset in the cosmic order of the universe caused by wrongdoing. Anything that goes beyond what is necessary for this restoration, then, is cruel; the peace and harmony is not balanced with excessive punishment or violence—the scale of wrongdoing merely tips to the other side. For example, the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, which means that we must “inquire into a prison official’s state of mind […]” when determining that the agent is not taking pleasure in inflicting pain and that punishment does not exceed the crime.

The third conception is victim-subjective, in which the “element of cruelty rests in the victim&#x27;s intense experience of suffering”. Here, the pain or the sense of degradation and humiliation experienced particularly and uniquely by the victim is considered. Recognizing cruelty, then, requires reference to our compassion rather than some normative standard of reasonableness. Continuing with the example of punishment, the state’s intention is not relevant in determining whether a punishment is cruel. According to the law, “ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity”, and this minimum is determined by “all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age, and state of health of the victim, etc.”

The fourth and final conception is the accumulation of all the prior conceptions: the victim-objective and agent-independent. This conception “refers to severe violations of the respect, recognition, and care that the unconditional and inherent dignity of each and every individual command”. Under this view, “cruelty occurs when a grave violation of human dignity that in normal circumstances would amount to cruelty is caused by individuals or by the operation of impersonal institutions, structures or social processes, even if the victim is unaware of his predicament”.

Beyond serving as an analytical framework, these four conceptions—the distinctive features of each as well as their collective evolution—reflect the reality that “the phenomenon of cruelty […] is a human-made problem that calls for preventive and corrective responses”.

==Criticism==
One criticism of the concept of cruelty suggests that it conflates disregard for others with hurting others for its own sake, arguing that the two are mutually exclusive: total disregard for what another being feels (be it a human or non-human) would be incompatible with deriving pleasure from hurting that being for its own sake, since caring about inflicting suffering would be incompatible with not caring.

==Literary references==
George Eliot, in the short story &quot;Janet&#x27;s Repentance&quot; from &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life&quot;, stated that &quot;cruelty, like every other vice, requires no motive outside itself — it only requires opportunity.&quot; Philosopher Bertrand Russell argued that almost all marriage customs involve cruelty towards those who do not follow them, meaning there was no rational basis for condemning one custom or another as sinful; he concluded that &quot;the cruelty habitually practised in punishing it is unnecessary...the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented hell.&quot; Gilbert K. Chesterton stated that &quot;cruelty is, perhaps, the worst kind of sin. Intellectual cruelty is certainly the worst kind of cruelty.&quot;

<text>Alvin Pleasant Delaney Carter (December 15, 1891 – November 7, 1960) was an American musician and a founding member of the Carter Family, one of the most notable acts in the history of country music.

A.P. suffered from a tremor in his right hand, which his mother ascribed a lightning strike when she was pregnant. Despite this, he successfully learned to play the fiddle and guitar during his childhood.

A.P., Sara, and Maybelle Carter started the Carter Family with Maybelle&#x27;s husband and A.P.&#x27;s brother, Ezra, as manager in 1927. They played up until Sara and A.P.&#x27;s divorce in 1936, but reunited in 1956.

==Biography==
A.P. Carter was born to Robert C. Carter and Mollie Arvelle Bays in Maces Spring, Virginia, an area in what is now Hiltons, Virginia, located in Poor Valley. A.P. was sometimes called &quot;Doc.&quot;

On June 18, 1915, he married Sara Dougherty; they had three children: Gladys (Millard), Janette (Jett), and Joe. In 1927, he formed the Carter Family band together with his wife. They were joined by Sara&#x27;s cousin, Maybelle, who was married to A.P.&#x27;s brother, Ezra Carter (father of June Carter Cash). Since A.P. worked as a traveling salesman, Carter was known for traveling extensively throughout Central Appalachia. His home in Poor Valley, in deep southwestern Virginia, is centrally located among eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, eastern Kentucky, and southeastern West Virginia. (The distance from Maces Spring to the state lines of each of those four other states is less than 25 miles). Carter was often accompanied by his friend Lesley Riddle, collecting and blending songs, particularly from Appalachian musicians, and from attending church services in many isolated localities, the source of the Carter Family&#x27;s many religious songs. Some of the songs became so closely identified with A.P. Carter that he has been popularly, but mistakenly, credited with writing them. For example, &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side of Life&quot; was published in 1901 with the words being credited to Ada Blenkhorn and the music credited to Howard Entwisle, and &quot;The Meeting in the Air&quot; has been published with credit given for music and words to I.G. Martin.

In a case of perfect timing, Victor Records was very interested in 1927 in widening the scope of its recordings and records so as to sell more of their record players, called &quot;Victrolas&quot;. Victor Records sent a &quot;mobile&quot; recording team around the country, seeking popular music. One of their stops was in Bristol, Tennessee, just a few miles from Maces Spring, and the Carter Family went there to record some songs, which soon became popular country-wide.

A.P. and Sara separated in 1932, in part as a result of Sara&#x27;s having an affair with A.P.&#x27;s cousin—A.P. was away from home for long periods in his job as a traveling salesman—and his search for new musical ideas. They divorced in 1939. The band remained together for several years afterwards, but broke up in 1943. While Maybelle and her daughters continued to tour as the Carter Family, A.P. left the music business to run a general store in Hiltons, Virginia.

Beginning in 1952, A.P. reunited with Sara, along with their children Janette and Joe, to record for the Kentucky based Acme Records. The majority of these recordings were made in the same building in Bristol where the original family first recorded in 1927. The new Carter Family was featured on stations such as WCKY, WWVA, KXEL, and many more. The family also appeared on a national CBS program. These records would prove to be A.P. Carter&#x27;s final recordings, with records with the new lineup being made well into 1956.

A.P. Carter died in Kingsport, Tennessee, on November 7, 1960, after long illness, at the age of 68. He was buried in the Mt. Vernon United Methodist Church cemetery in the Maces Springs area of Hiltons, Virginia.

==Legacy==

Despite dying in relative obscurity, A. P. Carter was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. Carter was inducted as part of the Carter Family in the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1970. In 1993, his image appeared on a U.S. postage stamp honoring the Carter Family. In 2001 he was inducted posthumously into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor.

PBS aired a one-hour show on A.P. Carter and the Carter Family in 2005 on &quot;American Experience&quot; titled &quot;Will The Circle Be Unbroken&quot;.

In recent years, Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, has performed a play by Douglas Pote based on A.P.&#x27;s life, called &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot; .

On her 2008 album &quot;All I Intended to Be&quot;, Emmylou Harris includes the song &quot;How She Could Sing the Wildwood Flower&quot;, co-written with Kate and Anna McGarrigle, about the relationship between A.P. and Sara, inspired by a documentary that the three of them saw on television.

The song &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, written by A.P. Carter and performed by the Carter Family in 1931, was revived in 2009 when Lulu and the Lampshades created a reworked version, using the cup game as percussion, titled &quot;Cups (When I&#x27;m Gone),&quot; which in turn was famously covered by Anna Kendrick for her 2012 film &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot;.

The A. P. and Sara Carter House, A. P. Carter Homeplace, A. P. Carter Store, Maybelle and Ezra Carter House, and Mt. Vernon Methodist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as components of the Carter Family Thematic Resource.

In keeping with A. P.&#x27;s dying wishes, his daughter Janette Carter restarted regular performances at A. P. Carter&#x27;s general store venue, and the organization became known as the Carter Family Fold, which continues to offer regular Appalachian music performances.

<text>The Victoria Racing Club was founded in 1864. It was formed following the disbanding of the Victoria Turf Club and the Victoria Jockey Club. A legacy passed from the Victoria Turf Club was the annual &quot;race that stops a nation&quot;, the Melbourne Cup, which was first contested in 1861.

From its foundation in 1864 until 2001, the Victoria Racing Club was the responsible authority for the conduct of thoroughbred racing in the State of Victoria, Australia. Since 2001, this role has been managed by Racing Victoria Limited.

The VRC is managed by an unpaid committee, elected by club members.

In 1871, the Victorian Government appointed the VRC as trustees of a site of 352 acres (1.4 km2) of Crown Land, next to the Maribyrnong River, which became known as Flemington Racecourse.
Much of the early success of the VRC is attributed to the administration of the first Secretary of the club, R. C. Bagot and his successors H. Byron Moore and A. V. Kewney.

==Racing carnivals==
The Victoria Racing Club hosts four race meetings at Flemington during the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival. The Melbourne Cup is run on the first Tuesday in November, the Victoria Derby are held on the Saturday before the Melbourne Cup, the VRC Oaks is on the Thursday following the Cup, and LKS MacKinnon Stakes is on the Saturday following the Oaks.

The VRC also hosts race meetings during the Melbourne Autumn Racing Carnival. These meetings include Group 1 races for the Australian Cup, the Newmarket Handicap and the Black Caviar Lightning.

<text>This is an alphabetical list of people on [[postage stamp|stamps]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. (The number in parentheses is the year of first appearance on a stamp.)

Until 2005, the Royal Mail policy was that the only identifiable living people depicted on British stamps were the monarch and other members of the Royal Family (or people imminently marrying into it). This policy was only occasionally broken. The first exception was in the 1967 issue commemorating the solo round the world voyage of &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; where a person appeared as an unidentifiable blob on the yacht – as there was only one person on board it must have been Francis Chichester. In 1968 the TUC stamp included the photos of three people, however they were not identified. Similarly in the issue honouring Freddie Mercury, drummer Roger Taylor can be seen in the background.

The rule was again broken in December 2003 when players from England&#x27;s team which beat Australia in the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final were shown; however, no faces appeared. The rule was finally abandoned with the release on 6 October 2005 of a set of stamps to commemorate the English cricket team&#x27;s victory over Australia in the 2005 Ashes series. The four stamps clearly and deliberately depict members of the team including captain Michael Vaughan and Andrew &quot;Freddie&quot; Flintoff. A series of stamps released in January 2007 featured some of the most famous Beatles album covers, which also show members of the band. Similarly, a 2011 stamp features actor David Tennant in the role of Hamlet. A series of gold medal stamps, issued during the 2012 Summer Olympics, feature British gold medal-winning athletes.

<text>A green belt is a policy, and land-use zone designation used in land-use planning to retain areas of largely undeveloped, wild, or agricultural land surrounding or neighboring urban areas. Similar concepts are greenways or green wedges, which have a linear character and may run through an urban area instead of around it. In essence, a green belt is an invisible line designating a border around a certain area, preventing development of the area and allowing wildlife to return and be established.

The more general term in the United States is green space or greenspace, which may be a very small area such as a park.

==Purposes==

In those countries which have them, the stated objectives of green belt policy are to:
* Protect natural or semi-natural environments;
* Improve air quality within urban areas;
* Ensure that urban dwellers have access to the countryside, with consequent educational and recreational opportunities;
* Protect the unique character of rural communities that might otherwise be absorbed by expanding suburbs.

The green belt has many benefits for people:
* Walking, camping, and biking areas close to cities, towns, or neighborhoods.
* Contiguous habitat network for wild plants, animals and wildlife.
* Cleaner air and water
* Better land use of areas within the bordering cities.

The effectiveness of green belts differs depending on location and country. They can often be eroded by urban rural fringe uses and sometimes, development &#x27;jumps&#x27; over the green belt area, resulting in the creation of &quot;satellite towns&quot; which, although separated from the city by the green belt, function more like suburbs than independent communities.

==History==
In the 7th century, Muhammad established a green belt around Medina. He did this by prohibiting any further removal of trees in a 12-mile-long strip around the city. In 1580 Elizabeth I of England banned new buildings in a 3-mile wide belt around the City of London in an attempt to stop the spread of plague. However, this was not widely enforced and it was possible to buy dispensations which reduced the effectiveness of the proclamation.

In modern times, the term emerged from continental Europe where broad boulevards were increasingly used to separate new development from the centers of historic towns; most notably the Ringstraße in Vienna. Green belt policy was then pioneered in the United Kingdom confronted with ongoing rural flight. The term itself was first used in relation to the growth of London by Octavia Hill in 1875. Various proposals were put forward from 1890 onwards but the first to garner widespread support was put forward by the London Society in its &quot;Development Plan of Greater London&quot; 1919. Alongside the CPRE they lobbied for a continuous belt (of up to two miles wide) to prevent urban sprawl, beyond which new development could occur.
There are fourteen green belt areas in the UK covering 16,716 km2 or 12.4% of England, and 164 km2 of Scotland; for a detailed discussion of these, see Green belt (UK). Other notable examples are the Ottawa Greenbelt and Golden Horseshoe Greenbelt in Ontario, Canada. Ottawa&#x27;s instance is managed by the National Capital Commission (NCC).

The dynamic Adelaide Park Lands, measuring approximately 7.6 km2, surround, unbroken, the city center of Adelaide. On the fringe of the eastern suburbs, an expansive natural green belt in the Adelaide Hills acts as a growth boundary for Adelaide and cools the city in the hottest months.

The concept of &quot;green belt&quot; has evolved in recent years to encompass not only &quot;Greenspace&quot; but also &quot;Greenstructure&quot; which comprises all urban and peri-urban green spaces, an important aspect of sustainable development in the 21st century. The European Commission&#x27;s COST Action C11
(COST – European Cooperation in Science and Technology) is undertaking
&quot;Case studies in Greenstructure Planning&quot; involving 15 European countries.

An act of the Swedish parliament from 1994 has declared a series of parks in Stockholm and the adjacent municipality of Solna to its north a &quot;national city park&quot; called Royal National City Park.

==Criticism==
===House prices===
When established around an economically prosperous city, homes in a green belt may have been motivated by or result in considerable premiums. They may also be more economically resilient as popular among the retired and less attractive for short-term renting of modest homes. Where in the city itself demand exceeds supply in housing, green belt homes compete directly with much city housing wherever such green belt homes are well-connected to the city. Further, they in all cases attract a future-guaranteed premium for protection of their views, recreational space and for the preservation/conservation value itself. Most also benefit from higher rates of urban gardening and farming, particularly when done in a community setting, which has positive effects on nutrition, fitness, self-esteem, and happiness, providing a benefit for both physical and mental health, in all cases easily provided or accessed in a green belt. Government planners also seek to protect the green belt as its local farmers are engaged in peri-urban agriculture which augments carbon sequestration, reduces the urban heat island effect, and provides a habitat for organisms. Peri-urban agriculture may also help recycle urban greywater and other products of wastewater, helping to conserve water and reduce waste.

The housing market contrasts with more uncertainty and economic liberalism inside and immediately outside of the belt: green belt homes have by definition nearby protected landscapes. Local residents in affluent parts of a green belt, as in parts of the city, can be assured of preserving any localized bourgeois status quo present and so assuming the green belt is not from the outset an area of more social housing proportionately than the city, it naturally tends toward greater economic wealth. In a protracted housing shortage, the reduction of the green belt is one of the possible solutions. All such solutions may be resisted however by private landlords who profit from a scarcity of housing, for example by lobbying to restrain new housing across the city. The stated motivation and benefits of the green belt might be well-intentioned (public health, social gardening and agriculture, environment), but inadequately realized relative to other solutions.

Critics include Mark Pennington and the economics-heavy think tanks such as the Institute of Economic Affairs who would see a reduction in many green belts. Such studies focus on the widely inherent limitations of green belts. In most examples, only a small fraction of the population uses the green belt for leisure purposes. The IEA study claims that a green belt is not strongly causally linked to clean air and water. Rather, they view the ultimate result of the decision to green-belt a city as one to prevent housing demand within the zone to be met with supply, thus exacerbating high housing prices and stifling competitive forces in general. 

===Increasing urban sprawl===
Another area of criticism comes from the fact that, since a green belt does not extend indefinitely outside a city, it spurs the growth of areas much further away from the city core than if it had not existed, thereby actually &quot;increasing&quot; urban sprawl. Examples commonly cited are the Ottawa suburbs of Kanata and Orleans, both of which are outside the city&#x27;s green belt and are currently undergoing explosive growth. This leads to other problems, as residents of these areas have a longer commute to workplaces in the city and worse access to public transport. It also means people have to commute through the green belt, an area not designed to cope with high levels of transportation. Not only is the merit of a green belt subverted, but the green belt may heighten the problem and make the city unsustainable.

There are many examples whereby the actual effect of green belts is to act as a land reserve for future freeways and other highways. Examples include sections of Ontario Highway 407 north of Toronto and the Hunt Club Road and Richmond Road south of Ottawa. Whether they are originally planned as such, or the result of a newer administration taking advantage of land that was left available by its predecessors is debatable.

===United Kingdom===

Green belts were established in England in 1955 to simply prevent the physical growth of large built-up areas; to prevent neighboring cities and towns from merging. In the UK, green belt around the major conurbations has been criticized as one of the main protectionist bars to building housing, the others being other planning restrictions (Local Plans and restrictive covenants) and developers&#x27; land banking. Local Plans and land banking are to be relaxed for home building in the 2015–2030 period by law and the green belt will be reduced by some local authorities as each local authority must now consider it among the available shortlisted options in drawing development plans to meet higher housing targets. Critics argue that the green belts defeat their stated objective of saving the countryside and open spaces. Such criticism falls short when considering the other, broader benefits such as peri-urban agriculture which includes gardening and carries many benefits, especially to the retired . It also ignores the strategic aims of the Attlee Ministry in 1946, just as in France, of shifting capital away from the capital city (addressing regional disparity) and avoiding intra-urban gridlock.

The restrictions of the Green Belt were particularly in the 1940s–1980s mitigated with planned, government-supported, new towns under the New Towns Act 1946 and New Towns Act 1981. These saw establishment beyond the green belts of new homes, infrastructure, businesses, and other facilities. Without large-scale sustainable development, infill development sees urban green space lost. A chronic housing shortage with inadequate new settlements and/or extension of those outside of the green belt and/or no green belt reduction has seen many brownfield sites, often well-suited to industry and commerce, lost in existing conurbations.

==Notable examples==
===Australia===

* Adelaide&#x27;s Central Business District is completely encircled by the Adelaide Parklands, as was initially planned in 1837.
* The Nillumbik Shire Council which is located approximately 30  km (19 miles) north-east of Melbourne is considered as &quot;The Green Wedge Shire&quot; because of the agreement with the Victorian Government which prevents high-density infrastructure from being built.
*Sydney is surrounded by the Royal National Park, the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and the Blue Mountains National Park on three sides, with the fourth side being oceanfront. The Western Sydney Parklands also provide a partial North-South green belt through suburban areas.

===Brazil===
*The São Paulo City Green Belt Biosphere Reserve – GBBR, an integral part of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve, was created in 1994 stemming from a people&#x27;s movement that collected 150 thousand signatures. It extends throughout 73 municipalities including São Paulo metro and the Santos area. With approximately 17,000 km², it is inhabited by about 23 million people, corresponding to more than 10% of the country&#x27;s total population in an area equivalent to 0.2% of the Brazilian territory. There are over 6,000 km² of forests and other Atlantic Forest ecosystems at the Reserve, one of the planet&#x27;s most threatened biomes. In addition to a spectacular biological diversity, the GBBR&#x27;s ecosystems render valuable ecosystem services.

===Canada===

* Ottawa Greenbelt, Canada&#x27;s oldest green belt. Created in 1956 to help curb urban sprawl, it surrounds the capital city of Ottawa. It is mostly owned and managed by the National Capital Commission (NCC). 
*Greenbelt (Golden Horseshoe), a 7300 km² band of land that encompasses the rural and agricultural land surrounding the Greater Toronto Area and Niagara Peninsula, and parts of the Bruce Peninsula. Most of the land consists of the Oak Ridges Moraine, an environmentally sensitive land that is a major aquifer for the region, and the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In an effort to restrain urban sprawl, the Ontario government created the Greenbelt Act in February 2005 to protect this greenspace from all future development, with the exception of limited agricultural use.
* British Columbia&#x27;s Agricultural Land Reserve protects agricultural land throughout the province from urban development, including its mountainous terrain and areas around Vancouver. This protection is strict and urban development of agricultural land is only allowed if no reasonable alternative exists. However, it does not protect non-agricultural land, particularly hillsides, leading to substantial, and highly visible, leapfrog-type hillside sprawl.
* Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Commission de protection du territoire agricole du Québec&quot; keeps territory (the agricultural zones) that is favorable for the practice and the development of agricultural activities. In so doing, the commission safeguards the agricultural territory and helps make its protection a local priority. The agricultural zones cover an area of 63 000 square kilometers in 952 local municipalities.

===Dominican Republic===
* The Greater Santo Domingo has a Greenbelt (Santo Domingo Greenbelt) project surrounding the whole Distrito Nacional. It is composed of the National Botanical Garden, Mirador Del Norte, Mirador del Este, and other parks surrounding the area from its outer &quot;municipios&quot;. The overall objective of this Greenbelt is for it to protect the water and natural reserves of Santo Domingo, as well as to regulate the expansion of settlements. However, it has largely been affected by uncontrolled urbanization, but other parts remain unaffected. With the aid of seventeen soldiers and some support from local municipalities, CONAU has been able to ensure the daily management and protection of the greenbelt. 
*When analyzing this Greenbelt, it is important to bring up the role the United States (US) has played in its creation and maintenance. The American national park model is what influenced the conservation efforts in the Dominican Republic. 
*In the plan and boundary designation of the national park of Del Este, the coastal waters were not included. This meant that the local community could fish and use the waters as they desired, which did not please American non-profit organizations (NGOs) that were working with the national park to plan and carry out the conservation of endangered species and beach clean-ups. However, the lack of inclusion of the local community and economy into the national park&#x27;s agenda meant that locals were left to find their own ways of feeding themselves and making money, as the creation of the park destroyed the fishing community that had previously thrived in the area.

===Iran===
*Tehran&#x27;s greenbelt has always been an issue in Iran&#x27;s regional politics. Under a decades-long megaproject, the length of the green belt of Tehran increased from 29 square kilometers in 1979 to 530 square kilometers in 2017, and the number of parks in urban and suburban areas also increased from 75 in 1979 to 2,211 in 2017 in total. Such actions and additional afforestation increased the humidity level and chance of precipitation in the city, which cools the summer&#x27;s temperatures down by up to 4 °C. The Tehran municipal government announced a goal of lengthening the green belt by 10 square kilometers each year.

===Europe===
* European Green Belt
* Banjica Forest, Belgrade
* Royal National City Park, Stockholm
* German Green Belt
* Inner and Outer Green Belt of Cologne(de)
* Coulée verte du sud parisien
* Coulée verte du nord parisien
* Promenade plantée
* Vienna Woods, Austria
* Rennes Green Belt, France
* Parco Agricolo Sud Milano, Milan

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the term Town Belt is most commonly used for an urban green belt.
* Dunedin Town Belt is one of the world&#x27;s oldest green belts, having been planned at the time of the city&#x27;s rapid growth during the Otago gold rush of the 1860s. It surrounds the city center on three sides (the fourth side being the city&#x27;s harbor).
* Hamilton Town Belt
* Leamington and Cambridge wide, surveyed by Charles Heaphy in 1864.
* Wellington Town Belt

===Thailand===
* Bangkok&#x27;s Bang Krachao Green Area located inside the curve of Chao Phraya River is considered a green area with authority control over urbanization. Today it is a popular spot for tourism and cycling. The area is located within the border of Bangkok Province and Samut Sakorn Province.

===South Korea===
* In 1965, the Korean Planners Association developed the Capital Region Urban Plan that incorporated a Greenbelt and satellite towns along the development corridor between Seoul and Incheon after being influenced by the Greater London Plan of 1944. 
*The official Greenbelt was first introduced as a &quot;Limited Development Area&quot; in 1971 with the then-new City Planning Law to prevent urban sprawl around Seoul. Green belts are currently designated around Seoul, Busan, and other metropolitan areas around the country.
*Other objectives include controlling northern parts for national security, eliminating illegal suburban shantytowns around Seoul, controlling land speculation, protecting agricultural land, and for environmental and natural resource protection.
*The rapid urbanization and economic growth of South Korea after the Korean War expedited the need for land use legislation. However, the boundaries of the greenbelt were hastily drawn and did not include public input or preexisting villages in the area. 
*The greenbelt reduced housing and property prices within the greenbelt causing landowners to lose economic capital that could be gained from developing the land. However, there are many benefits of the greenbelt in terms of nature preservation, better air quality, and the push for increased efficiency of infrastructure and public services in the urban areas. 

===United Kingdom===

* The Metropolitan Green Belt: 1,969 sq. miles (5,100 km2).
* The North West Green Belt: 1,003 sq. miles (2,600 km2)
* South and West Yorkshire Green Belt: 1,003 sq. miles (2,600 km2)
* West Midlands Green Belt: 888 sq. miles (2,300 km2)

===United States===
* The U.S. states of Oregon, Washington and Tennessee require cities to establish urban growth boundaries (UGBs).
* Notable U.S. cities which have adopted UGBs include Portland, Oregon; Twin Cities, Minnesota; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky (the first greenbelt in the U.S. in 1958); and Miami-Dade County, Florida.
* The Public Works Administration of the New Deal created three Greenbelt communities based on the ideas of Ebenezer Howard which are now the municipalities of Greenbelt, Maryland, Greenhills, Ohio, and Greendale, Wisconsin.
* More than 20 cities in the San Francisco Bay Area have UGBs (see Greenbelt Alliance, a Bay Area organization that has been involved in establishing these boundaries).
* Staten Island Greenbelt and Brooklyn-Queens Greenway in New York City
* Barton Creek Greenbelt, Austin
* Rotonda West, Florida near to Punta Gorda using a radial layout.
* Ann Arbor, Michigan is acquiring conservation easements on agricultural land around the city without the establishment of an urban growth boundary. While the city&#x27;s initial plan did not include the participation of surrounding townships, at least four townships have participated directly or have initiated their own efforts to protect agricultural land surrounding the city.
* Boise Greenbelt, Boise, Idaho
* &quot;The Jungle&quot;, Seattle
* The Emerald Necklace in Boston is halfway between a green belt and a greenway, nearly ringing central Boston. The final link in the chain, the Dorchesterway, was never constructed.
* The Chicago park and boulevard system

<text>Sir Sidney Lee (5 December 1859 – 3 March 1926) was an English biographer, writer, and critic.

==Biography==
Lee was born Solomon Lazarus Lee in 1859 at 12 Keppel Street, Bloomsbury, London. He was educated at the City of London School and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated in Modern History in 1882. In 1883, Lee became assistant-editor of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. In 1890 he became joint editor and, on the retirement of Sir Leslie Stephen in 1891, succeeded him as editor.

Lee wrote over 800 articles in the &quot;Dictionary&quot;, mainly on Elizabethan authors or statesmen. His sister Elizabeth Lee also contributed. While still at Balliol, Lee had written two articles on Shakespearean questions, which were printed in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 1884, he published a book about Stratford-upon-Avon, with illustrations by Edward Hull. Lee&#x27;s entry on Shakespeare in the 51st volume (1897) of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; formed the basis of his &quot;Life of William Shakespeare&quot; (1898), which reached its fifth edition in 1905.

In 1902, Lee edited the Oxford facsimile edition of the first folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s comedies, histories and tragedies, followed in 1902 and 1904 by supplementary volumes giving details of extant copies, and in 1906 by a complete edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

Lee received a knighthood in 1911. Between 1913 and 1924, he served as professor of English Literature and Language at East London College. In 1915 he delivered the British Academy&#x27;s Shakespeare Lecture.

==Works==
Besides the editions of English classics, Lee&#x27;s works include:
*&quot;Queen Victoria: A Biography&quot; (1902)
* &quot;Great Englishmen of the Sixteenth century&quot; (1904), based on his Lowell Institute lectures at Boston, Massachusetts, in 1903
* &quot;Shakespeare and the Modern Stage&quot; (1906)
* Annual Shakespeare Lecture of the British Academy (1915)
* &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s England : an account of the life &amp; manners of his age&quot; (1916, with Walter Alexander Raleigh) 
*&quot;King Edward VII, a Biography&quot; (1925) (The second volume of the biography was completed, after Lee&#x27;s death, by S. F. Markham and published in 1927. See &quot;King Edward VII: A Biography: Volume II: The Reign, 22nd January 1901 to 6th May 1910&quot; by Sir Sidney Lee [New York: The Macmillan Company, 1927], page vi.)

There are personal letters from Lee, including those written during his final illness, in the T. F. Tout Collection of the John Rylands Library in Manchester.

<doc id="232439" wikidata="Q6504589" url="?curid=232439" title="Lawrence Sheriff School">
<text>Lawrence Sheriff School (LSS) is a boys&#x27; grammar school in Rugby, Warwickshire, England. The school is named after Lawrence Sheriff, the Elizabethan founder of Rugby School. The school was founded in 1878, in order to continue Sheriff&#x27;s original bequest for a free grammar school for the boys of Rugby and surrounding villages, which had originally been fulfilled by Rugby School, until the latter moved to become a fee-paying public school in the 19th century. The school&#x27;s name is often shortened to &#x27;LSS&#x27;, or often just &#x27;Sheriff&#x27;. The school has historically run in partnership with Rugby High School for Girls, a nearby grammar school.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
Lawrence Sheriff School was founded to fulfill Lawrence Sheriff&#x27;s original intentions to provide a school for the boys of Rugby and neighbouring Brownsover, which was originally carried out by Rugby School. By the eighteenth century, Rugby School had acquired a national reputation as a public school and moved to its present site.

As the proportion of pupils from outside Rugby increased and the people of the town seemed to benefit less from Lawrence Sheriff&#x27;s original bequest, local concern led to the nineteenth-century proposal of a Lower School for local boys, with Foundation Scholarships to the Great School. It was proposed to become &quot;a first rate school for the sons of tradesmen and middle classes&quot;. Although the proposal faced substantial local opposition, the Lower School was opened in 1878 on the present site of Lawrence Sheriff School with a curriculum designed to meet the needs of a commercial education and preparation for Rugby School. By 1906, a compromise between the traditions of the Foundation and a proposal to hand the school over to the county, led to a Governing body chaired by the Headmaster of Rugby School and containing both Foundation and County Governors. The school was built on what before was glebe land named Market Field, at what was the east limit of the built-up area of Rugby.

===Second World War===
Due to the need for maximum food production within Britain during the Second World War, unproductive land (sports fields, large ornamental gardens, parks, golf courses, etc.) was requisitioned for farming or allotment gardens. In this period, the School Field and a third of the Hart Field were used in the grass growing season for sheep grazing but remained in school sport use. Most of the rest of the Hart Field was ploughed and used for growing wheat, except a strip along the bottom edge border that was used for allotment gardens; that border was adjacent to existing allotment gardens which were outside the school property. Approximately one third of the school&#x27;s sixth form lost their lives during the war.

=== Voluntary aided status ===
This partnership continued into voluntary aided status under the 1944 Act.

At the time the school opened, it was on the outskirts of Rugby town, which in 1878 was much smaller than now. The original building (now called Big School), was extended in 1909 with side wings (now used for Art and MFL) on each side. The school continued to grow with several extensions, including the Jubilee Wings (1926 and 1934), the library wing (1957), and major expansion in the early 1960s, which included new biology labs and a new gymnasium. Big School was badly damaged by a fire in 1980, but was immediately restored. The school organ was damaged beyond repair and was replaced.

In September 2014 Lawrence Sheriff School converted to academy status, thus ending its status as a voluntary aided school.

== Present day ==
Lawrence Sheriff School is now the selective boys&#x27; grammar school for Rugby and the surrounding area. The school also has an old boys society: the Old Laurentians.

The school has been expanded greatly in the last fifteen years with the construction of a new sixth form centre and the conversion of Penrhos House, originally the sixth form common room, into a Music block, as well as the construction of a new Learning Resources Centre, and a new Science Block.

=== Sport ===
The school owns a playing field, Hart Field, a mile away east-southeastwards, with five Rugby pitches and changing rooms. Over the school year of 2009, the field was regenerated with new pitches created, including an Astroturf field, a new block of changing rooms, cricket nets and levelled playing fields.

Following funding from Sport England, the school also houses a regional and local table tennis centre.

== Academic performance ==
In 2008, 2010 and 2011 the school came first in national performance tables based upon data from the Department for Education (schools were ranked by their total points score in examinations). In 2012 it came fourth in the country and in 2013 it came seventh out of 3,200 secondary schools.

In 2013 75% of boys gained the English Baccalaurate. Comparing this to local selective schools in the area 87% of King Edward VI pupils, 73% of Bablake pupils, 66% of Rugby High School pupils and 64% of Rugby School pupils gained the certificate.

In 2014 97% of boys gained the English Baccalaurate, placing the school third in the country according to the performance tables published in the Daily Telegraph on Thursday 29 January. The same table showed that the school&#x27;s average points score placed it fifteenth in the country.

In January 2009 the school achieved an average point score of 792, whilst in January 2011 it came top again, with an average point score of 757.4.

== Recent changes ==

The school operates a vertical tutoring system, in which forms consist of students from each year group. This was implemented to allow older students to mentor and support younger students. It also provides tutors with increased opportunities to support individual students and to check their progress more closely.

The school is partnering with Lutterworth High School in order to sponsor a primary school in the area. However, Peter Kent, the school&#x27;s previous headmaster, stated that the new school will not become a feeder school for Lawrence Sheriff.

In September 2020, a new house, named Kent house after the longest-serving headteacher Peter Kent, was introduced. As of April 2024, Kent house has members in Year 7 to 10 and 12 to 13. 

A new science building was completed in 2021. Following this, the Art department has taken over rooms previously used for sciences.

Historically, the positions of head boy and, once the sixth form became mixed, head girl were filled through a competitive election cycle including speeches and teacher and student voting. The head student position was abolished in 2021.

== Notable Old Laurentians ==

==Houses==
There are five houses: Caldecott (Purple), Simpson (Green), Tait (Red), Wheeler (Blue) and Kent (Yellow). There are many inter-house competitions between the five. These competitions can range from sports or academic competitions. At the end of each year, the house with the most points for each competition wins a trophy. In 2020, Kent house was established to fit the increasing number of students being admitted.

Wheeler house was renamed from &quot;School House&quot; in 1963.

Tait house was named after a local auctioneer and parent- Edwin Tait. In 1891, an altercation broke out between Mr Tait and the headmaster Mr Weisse over the flogging of his son. The situation was resolved and Mr Tait subsequently presented a cup for the Champion Athlete.

Kent house was named after Professor Peter Kent, the previous headmaster who departed the school at the end of the 2021 autumn term. Professor Kent recently spoke at COP28.

== Local Government Ombudsman Report ==
On 19 May 2014 the school was found at fault by the Local Government Ombudsman for failing to provide an appeal to a child whose place was withdrawn for 2013 entry.

== Harassment against the school ==
In 2015 at the Coventry County Court, the School successfully applied for an injunction against a parent who for many years harassed senior members of the school through a number of different channels. The judge ruled that the parent had &quot;crossed the boundary between unattractive or unreasonable conduct to conduct, which is, indeed, oppressive and unacceptable. It has plainly involved a deliberate and persistent course of, in my view, unreasonable and oppressive conduct, which was calculated to, and did, cause alarm, fear or distress…”

== Other information ==
* The Parents&#x27; Association is in the Guinness Book of Records as the UK&#x27;s oldest Parents Association.
* The school has a partnership with Rugby School and is twinned at Years 12 and 13 (the sixth form) of education with Rugby High School

<text>Flemington Racecourse is a major horse racing venue located in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is most notable for hosting the Melbourne Cup, which is the world&#x27;s richest handicap and the world&#x27;s richest 3200-metre horse race. The racecourse is situated on low alluvial flats, next to the Maribyrnong River. The area was first used for horse racing in March 1840.

== Overview ==
The Flemington Racecourse site comprises 1.27 square kilometres of Crown land. The course was originally leased to the Victoria Turf Club in 1848, which merged with the Victoria Jockey Club in 1864 to form the Victoria Racing Club. The first Melbourne Cup was run in 1861. In 1871 the Victoria Racing Club Act was passed, giving the VRC legal control over Flemington Racecourse.

The racecourse is pear-shaped, and boasts a six-furlong (1,200 m) straight known as &#x27;the Straight Six.&#x27; The track has a circumference of and a final straight of for race distances over . Races are run in an anti-clockwise direction.

The course has a crowd capacity of over 120,000 and contains three grandstands. The biggest ever attendance was on Victoria Derby Day in 2006 when 129,069 people saw Efficient win the Victoria Derby. On 28 November, 1986, Pope John Paul II celebrated the Mass on the racetrack inner oval. The racecourse has undergone a facelift in recent years, with the opening of a new $45 million grandstand in 2000 and the opening of a new members&#x27; grandstand in 2018. It also contains a bronze statue of the famous racehorse Phar Lap, which was donated to the Club as part of Australia&#x27;s bicentenary celebrations in 1988. Also in celebration was the commission of Harold Freedman&#x27;s seven panel mural which traces the History of Racing. The mural is housed is in The Hill Stand, built in 1977.

Flemington Racecourse was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 7 November 2006, announced during the 2006 Melbourne Cup. The site is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

Flemington Racecourse today hosts many of Australia&#x27;s top races, including the Melbourne Cup, Victoria Derby, VRC Oaks, Mackinnon Stakes, Newmarket Handicap, Australian Cup and Lightning Stakes.

== Transport ==
The site has its own railway branch line, which operates on race days, bringing visitors to the adjacent railway station. Originally, it was serviced by Salt Water River station, before that was demolished in the 1860s and replaced with a station on the present site. Trains depart from platforms 8 and 9 at Flinders Street Station.
The No. 57 tram from the City (Elizabeth and Flinders Streets) stops at the Epsom Road entrance.

Car spaces for the disabled are available and taxi ranks are located adjacent to the main entrances.
Shuttle buses run from Epsom Road to the main turnstiles of the racecourse.
Lift access is available in the Prince of Wales Stand and to the first floor of the Members Stand.

<text>The Ford Sierra is a mid-size/large family car manufactured and marketed by Ford of Europe from 1982–1993. It was designed by Uwe Bahnsen, Robert Lutz and Patrick Le Quément, and was noted for its aerodynamic styling. It has a drag coefficient of 0.34, a significant improvement over its predecessors.

The Sierra debuted at the 1982 British International Motor Show in Birmingham, then appeared at the 1982 Paris Salon de l&#x27;Automobile. Sales began on 15 October 1982, replacing the Ford Taunus TC3 and Ford Cortina Mark V. The Sierra&#x27;s aerodynamic styling and the initial absence of a saloon alienated many conservative buyers, including company car drivers. A saloon was added in 1987 with the introduction of the facelifted Sierra.

Developed under the internal code name &quot;Project Toni&quot;, the &quot;Sierra&quot; name is derived from the Spanish word for a mountain range. Most cars were manufactured in Belgium and the United Kingdom, although Sierras were also assembled in Cork, Ireland, Argentina, Venezuela, South Africa, and New Zealand.

==Initial development and reception==


By 1978, Ford Europe was working on a new mid-range model, codenamed &quot;Project Toni&quot;, to replace the Cortina/Taunus twins in the early 1980s. Although still popular with buyers, the outgoing Cortina/Taunus was a 12-year old design by the time of the Sierra&#x27;s launch — despite the TC2 shape being launched in 1976, and the mildly reworked TC3/Mk5 three years later, both were merely reskinned versions of the 1970 TC/Mk3, with few major mechanical changes. Ford&#x27;s future model policy and styling direction had already been shown with the Escort III two years earlier, with the conventionally styled saloons of the 1970s replaced by hatchbacks with advanced aerodynamic styling.

In 1981, a year before the Sierra&#x27;s official launch, Ford confirmed that its new mid-range car be called the Sierra, signalling the end of the Taunus and Cortina nameplates after 43 years and nine generations, or 20 years and five generations respectively. In September 1981, Ford unveiled the Probe III concept car at the Frankfurt Motor Show, hinting at what the new car would look like when unveiled 12 months later.

After the sharp-edged straight-line three-box styling of its predecessors, the Sierra was nicknamed &quot;the jellymould&quot;. The shape served a purpose though, producing a drag coefficient of 0.34, a significant improvement over the boxy outgoing Taunus&#x27;s/Cortina&#x27;s 0.45. This aerodynamic design was key for reducing fuel consumption according to Ford, and was even used as compensation for the V6 engines. The interior was more conventional, taking a page from BMW by its dashboard, angled to the driver.

Sales were slow in the first months – aggravated by heavy discounting by Ford dealers of surplus Cortina stock from the autumn of 1982 on, with more than 11,000 new Cortinas being registered in 1983. However in 1983, its first full year of sales, the Sierra managed nearly 160,000 sales in Britain, outsold only by the smaller Escort. Ford had also launched the more conservatively designed Escort-based Orion saloon that year, which found favour with buyers who would otherwise have been the Sierra&#x27;s target customers.

In West Germany, it proved popular from an early stage; within months of its launch, it was reportedly achieving treble the number of sales that the Taunus had been attaining – though in West Germany, the Taunus had not been quite as popular or iconic as its Cortina equivalent had been in Britain.

It was later in the Sierra&#x27;s life that the styling began to pay off; ten years after its introduction, the Sierra&#x27;s styling was not nearly as outdated as its contemporaries, even though all major competitors were newer designs, though the Sierra had been tweaked on several occasions and many new engines had been added. The most notable changes came at the autumn of 1987, with a major facelift and the addition of a 4-door saloon (UK: Sapphire). As other manufacturers adopted similar aerodynamic styling, the Sierra looked more normal. At its peak, it was Britain&#x27;s second best selling car in 1983, 1988 and 1989, and was still Britain&#x27;s fifth best selling car in 1992. Its best year was 1989, when more than 175,000 were sold. However, it was outsold by the Vauxhall Cavalier in MK2 form during 1984 and 1985, and then from 1990 until its demise by the MK3 Cavalier. Nevertheless, it comfortably outsold its second key rival, the Austin Montego, which was launched in April 1984. Between 1985 and 1988, the Sierra faced fresh competition in Europe from the likes of the Renault 21 and Peugeot 405, while Japanese carmaker Nissan was producing its Bluebird model in Britain from 1986.
Early versions suffered from crosswind stability problems, which were addressed in 1985 with the addition of aerodynamic nolders (small spoilers) on the rear edge of the rubber seals of the rearmost side windows. These shortcomings saw a lot of press attention, and contributed to early slow sales, when it was outsold by its key rival the Vauxhall Cavalier in 1984 and 1985. Other rumours that the car&#x27;s design could hide major crash damage (in part true, as the new bumper design sprang back after minor impact and couldn&#x27;t be &quot;read&quot; to interpret major damage) also harmed the car&#x27;s reputation. This reached near-hysterical heights in its early months on sale, with UK press making a report that Ford would reintroduce the previous Cortina model out of desperation. These reports were swiftly denied by Ford. However, sales began to rise during 1983, and it finished as Britain&#x27;s second best selling car behind the Escort. After being outsold by the Cavalier for the next two years, it regained its lead of the market sector in Britain during 1986, and a refreshed range (with more engine options as well as the introduction of a saloon) enjoyed a surge in sales from 1987, though the MK3 Cavalier finally outsold it in 1990. Even in 1992, the Sierra was still Britain&#x27;s fifth best selling car. It was nicknamed &quot;the salesman&#x27;s spaceship&quot; on account of its status as a popular fleet car in Britain.

In contrast to the Sierra&#x27;s exterior design, its drivetrain was conservatively engineered, retaining rear-wheel drive and the same engines and transmissions as the Cortina/Taunus which were effectively 12 years old as they were first used on the TC1/MkIII generation in 1970. Much of this was done to appease the important fleet market which was wary of complexity. However, there was much modification; for example the engines were fitted with breakerless ignition, improved carburettors and the option of fuel injection, whilst 5-speed transmissions were now available. Most competitors were already switched to front-wheel drive around that time. Ford claimed however this set-up was required to offer V6 engines, which had to contribute to the Sierra&#x27;s driving comfort. New for the Sierra was a diesel engine, although the engine itself was not new at all. Similar to the Ford Granada, Ford used an &quot;Indenor&quot; engine which was designed by Peugeot in the 1950s. While the Granada was offered with 1.9, 2.1, and 2.5 diesels, the Sierra unit had a displacement of 2.3 litres. This rather outdated engine was replaced in 1989 by an all-new, 1.8-litre turbodiesel, developed by Ford itself. The Sierra had a four-speed manual gearbox as standard, with a five-speed as option but standard on the 2.3D and 2.3 V6. At a time when the rival Vauxhall Cavalier was offered with a five-speed, this led to some critics commenting that the Sierra was somewhat underpowered. In the mid-1980s, many smaller cars (some even two segments smaller) featured five-speed gearboxes as standard.

The chassis, however, was more sophisticated than the Cortina/Taunus, with fully independent suspension on both axles. The rear suspension was essentially carried over from the Granada, with trailing arms and coil springs mounted on a tubular subframe which also provided location for the final drive/differential housing driving the axle shafts. The front suspension dispensed with the Cortina/Taunus&#x27; double wishbones in favour of a scaled-up version of the Fiesta and Escort/Orion&#x27;s layout with MacPherson struts, lower locating arms, and anti-roll bars.

One striking feature of the Sierra was its closed front panel — where typically a grille was located, later found on the 1985 Ford Taurus. The air intake was situated below the front bumper, making the Sierra a so-called &#x27;bottom breather&#x27;. The headlights were integrated in this front panel while the indicators were mounted in the bumper within a combined unit with the foglights. However, this setup was present only on the top-of-the-line &quot;Ghia&quot; trim as well on the later introduced XR4i sportmodel. The other Sierra models had a more traditional front end with a two-bar grille between the headlights, being unpainted on the base model. These models had the indicators in the bumper as well, although being slimmer but wider and without the foglights. Both the Ghia and XR4i had wide headlights with two lenses while the other models had smaller lights with a single lens. For the 1985 model year, all the lower-spec models, except the base model, adopted the Ghia&#x27;s and XR4i&#x27;s front grille and headlight treatment. However, the second lens of the lower-spec models had no actual light within it. On the Ghia and XR4i this lens contained additional high-beam lamps. The South-African XR8 model&#x27;s front end was similar to the XR4i&#x27;s but featured a small grille between the headlights. The rear lights of the Ghia, as well as the very early XR4i&#x27;s, were the same shape and layout as other models, but featured tiny horizontal black strakes on the lenses to give the impression that they were smoked.

The Sierra initially competed directly with the General Motors &quot;J-car&quot; (Opel Ascona C/Vauxhall Cavalier), which had been launched in 1981 with front-wheel drive and a hatchback body style to complement the saloon. 

It was also a strong competitor for other rivals of the early 1980s, including the Talbot Alpine, Peugeot 505 and Morris Ital and the Citroën BX, but by 1988 it was competing with a host of new rivals, including the third-generation Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra), Rover Montego, Peugeot 405, Renault 21 and Nissan Bluebird. By the time of the Sierra&#x27;s replacement it stood out from almost all D-segment rivals for its rear-wheel drive layout.

The car was replaced by the Mondeo in Europe in April 1993, though stocks lasted for about two years afterwards. The Sierra remained a popular second-hand buy and common sight on British roads until well beyond the year 2000.

===Press evaluation===

In Europe&#x27;s largest auto-market, the magazine &quot;Auto, Motor und Sport&quot; published, in December 1982, a three-way road test comparison involving the Sierra and its obvious competitors, the recently upgraded Volkswagen Passat and Opel Ascona (Vauxhall Cavalier Mk II in the UK). The Sierra tested in 1982 outranked both the Passat and the Ascona.

The significance of this result was highlighted more than three decades later, in February 2015, when the magazine reported that no Ford model had beaten a Volkswagen under their road test criteria since the Sierra&#x27;s &quot;victory&quot; in 1982.

The Sierra missed out on the 1983 European Car of the Year award, ending second behind the Audi 100.

===Celebrity===
Just before he became leader of the Labour Party in 1983, Neil Kinnock became the owner of one of the first Sierras produced for the British market, but his car was wrecked in a crash on the M4 motorway in Berkshire soon after he bought it. He escaped from the crash uninjured.

In 1986, the founder of the Williams Formula One team, former racing car driver and mechanic, Sir Frank Williams crashed whilst driving a rental Ford Sierra in France, rendering him tetraplegic.

Willem-Alexander, then Prince of the Netherlands, crashed his Sierra XR4x4 in 1988 in the city of Leiden where he attended the university as a student.

==All-wheel drive==
In 1985, at the Geneva Motor Show, the four-wheel-drive Sierra XR4x4 was shown as a derivative of the XR4i. It had two viscous differentials with two thirds of the power directed towards the rear wheels. It was originally available only as a three-door hatchback; the bodywork had the large single-piece rear windows rather than the design with an additional pillar as used on the XR4. The XR4x4 had a single rear spoiler instead of the distinctive biplane unit used on the XR4 but did receive unique alloy wheels. A five-door version was added soon thereafter. A four-wheel-drive estate became available with this drive train at the 1986 Geneva Motor Show, but with Ghia rather than XR4x4 badging. This version was better equipped and without the sporting edge of the hatchbacks, and was also available with an automatic transmission. The four-wheel drive allowed for an extra margin of security on slick or snowy roads, while retaining the car&#x27;s rear-wheel-drive comportment.

The original rear-wheel-drive XR4 was quickly taken out of production after the XR4x4 arrived. The XR4x4 originally came equipped with the 2.8-litre Cologne V6 engine using the same Bosch K-Jetronic mechanical injection system used since 1977 in the Granada, and since 1981 in the Capri, but it was replaced in 1989 by the new more efficient 2.9-litre Cologne V6 engine, with electronic fuel injection. The 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine also became available with the four-wheel-drive system after the 1987 facelift.

==1987 facelift==
In February 1987, a restyled Sierra was launched for the 1988 model year and a four-door saloon version was added to the range – this was marketed as the Sierra Sapphire on the UK market. The front end was completely revised, with the biggest difference being the indicators now positioned above the bumper and to the side of a new headlight design. While the grille again remained blanked off, the UK, Irish, and South African versions of the newly introduced saloon version featured a unique shallow black grille between the headlights. That apart, all specifications of the Sierra now shared a common front end, unlike the original line-up. The side windows were made slightly larger with the corners made sharper to increase outward vision. The rear lights were replaced with slimmer but wider models containing separate stop lamps. The saloon got similar rear lights to the revised hatchbacks, though not interchangeable. The rear end of the estate did not change during the Sierra&#x27;s lifespan. The interior was slightly modernized.

Also new to the range was a new 1.8-litre &quot;lean burn&quot; petrol engine, which proved to be one of the most popular choices in the Sierra range.

The XR4x4 was now based on the five-door hatchback body style and featured different front and rear body-coloured bumper styling, along with wider side rubbing strips. The RS Cosworth, from January 1988, was now based on the newly introduced saloon body style and featured another style of front bumper as well as the black grille which was found only on UK versions of the saloon bodystyle. The RS Cosworth received more power and four-wheel drive from January 1990. In addition, a roller cam engine was added in 1987 to prevent excessive wear to the cam.

From 1988, a pickup called the P100 was produced in Portugal using the Sierra cab and engines, replacing the previous Cortina/Taunus-related model.

===1990 and later updates===

The Sierra and Sapphire continued to be given minor updates for the remaining years of production. The 1990 model year cars featured new smoked rear lamp lenses and a general upgrade to equipment levels across the range. By the 1991 model year, 1.6L CVH, 1.8 CVH and 2.0L DOHC petrol models were available with the option of a catalytic converter, before their adoption became compulsory at the end of 1992 - the non-catalysed 1.6L cars marked the final usage of the venerable Pinto engine in a Ford of Europe passenger car (it continued to be used in the Ford Transit for several more years), before it was finally dropped during 1992.

For the 1992 model year - the Sierra&#x27;s final full year in production before the launch of the Ford Mondeo, the dashboard was updated with a new instrument surround that mirrored the look of the new-generation Escort and Orion. The &quot;low-series&quot; instrument cluster was dropped — all trim levels now used the &quot;high-series&quot; version, with an analogue clock replacing the tachometer on base specification models. Mid 1992 saw the final updates, with new steering wheels, updated equipment levels and the introduction of run-out models such as the &quot;Azure&quot; and &quot;Chausseur&quot;. The final European made Sierras rolled off the production line in December 1992 as the Genk factory was switched over to Mondeo production.

==Bodystyles==
The switch to the Sierra from the Cortina and Taunus was the second time that Ford had changed its saloon-based line-up into a hatchback-based one following the launch of the Escort Mark III in 1980, and before the introduction of the Scorpio (known as the Granada Mark III in the UK and Ireland) in 1985. However, like the Cortina and Taunus before it, the Sierra was available as an estate.

The company launched the Ford Orion in 1983 to fill the gap in the saloon range left by the Cortina. Ford found that customers were more attached to the idea of a saloon than they had expected, and this was further addressed in 1987 by the production of a saloon version of the Sierra. In the UK, this model was called the Ford Sierra Sapphire. This differed from the other Sierra models in having a traditional black grille, which appeared only in right hand drive markets.

During the life of the car, two different styles of 3-door body were used; one with two pillars rear of the door, looking very much like a modified 5-door frame, as used on the high-performance XR4i; and a one-pillar design used on standard-performance 3-door hatchbacks and also at the other end of the scale as the basis for the very high-performance RS Cosworth.

At the time of the car&#x27;s launch, both styles were already envisaged, and a demonstration model with one style on either side was displayed at a Sierra design exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, but the one-pillar design was not launched until 1984. The three-door Sierra was later dropped in the UK after just two years, only to be revived for the Cosworth version. Production of the 3-door Sierra continued in continental Europe, including after the Sierra range was given a facelift in 1987, but this was never offered in the UK. After 1987, the Cosworth used the four-door saloon body style instead.

A 5-door van based on the estate, known as the Sierra Van, was introduced in 1984, which, unlike similar car-derived vans, retained its side windows. The back seat was removed and the metal cargo floor was extended towards the front seats. A diesel engine and a limited choice of petrol engines were available for the Van. This variant was never sold in the UK, although some were produced in right-hand-drive for the Irish market.

Two diesel engines were available:
* 2.3 I4 D (2304 cc, ) Peugeot Diesel engine (1982–1989);
* 1.8 I4 TD (1753 cc; ) Endura-D engine (from 1990)

1300, 1600, and 2000 engines all had a 4-speed manual gearbox; a 5-speed manual gearbox was optional with 1600 and 2000 engines, and standard with the 1600 Economy engine, the 2300 and 2300 Diesel. An optional 3-speed automatic transmission was available with 1600, 2000 and 2300 engines.

The 2.0 V6 and 2.3 V6 versions of the Sierra were dropped at the end of 1985 and the 1.3-litre was discontinued in 1986. A carburetted 1.8 and a fuel-injected 2.0-litre petrol engine were added at Geneva 1985. In 1990, the 2.3-litre diesel was replaced by a 1.8-litre turbodiesel. The turbocharged 2-litre RS Cosworth engine featured on all three Cosworth versions of the Sierra; the three-door rear-wheel-drive hatchback, the rear-wheel-drive saloon, and the four-wheel-drive saloon.

The sporting model XR4i utilized the 2.8 engine with mechanical fuel injection (Bosch K Jetronic) coupled to rear-wheel drive (1983–1985) and to four-wheel-drive as XR4x4 (1985–1987). There were visual differences and alterations between the XR4i and XR4x4, such as coloured bumpers, the removal of the &#x27;biplane&#x27; rear wing and alloy wheels as seen on the Ford Escort RS Turbo Series 1. There was also a 2.8-litre Ghia Estate in some markets, and from 1985 until 1987 Swiss customers could buy rear-wheel-drive 2.8-litre powered GL and Ghia models with five-door hatchback or estate bodywork. The Swiss (and Swedish) market engines produced marginally less power, as those countries had particularly stringent emissions standards. Output was in 1985 and in 1986. In the Mark II Sierras the 2.8 &quot;Cologne&quot; engine was replaced by a 2.9-litre version. Both the 2.8/2.9-litre engines gave 150 PS in uncatalyzed trim.

The well known Cosworth model was powered by a turbocharged 16-valve 4-cylinder engine known as the &#x27;YB&#x27; which was based on the Ford &quot;Pinto&quot; block. The Ford Sierra RS Cosworth was introduced in 1986 as a three-door hatchback, with a 2-litre DOHC turbo engine producing and a top speed of 150 m.p.h. – a speed normally found only in sports cars from prestige brands like Ferrari and Porsche, at much higher prices as well as with less practicality. At the time Ford wanted to compete in Group-A touring cars and therefore eligible to produce a limited run of 10% of the initial production, therefore this would be 500 cars. This was known as an &#x27;evolution&#x27; model. Ford employed Tickford to help with the development. The Sierra RS500 as it was known sported a small additional rear spoiler, and larger front chin spoiler, extra cooling ducts for the engine, brakes, and intercooler. The placement of the additional cooling ducts is where the foglights seen on the previous Sierra RS Cosworth had an option to remove and refit the aforementioned foglights. A larger turbocharger and intercooler was fitted along with an extra set of injectors, so instead of the standard four injectors it was built with eight, although in road trim these extra injectors did not function. These modifications produced in road trim and around in race trim. They were very successful in motorsport and are highly tunable road cars with a very large following.

In 1987, Ford introduced a four-door saloon (marketed in the UK as the Sierra Sapphire), which was sold alongside the hatchback and estate until the Sierra was replaced by the Mondeo in early 1993. The last Sierra rolled off the production line in December 1992.

The Sierra Cosworth line-up switched to a saloon body style with a four-door arrangement in January 1988, aptly named the &#x27;Sapphire&#x27;, again with rear-wheel drive, before the four-wheel-drive version replaced it two years later. The Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth was based on the second-generation variant of the Sierra model, having a different front and rear fascia compared to the first-generation Sierra. The same turbocharged 2-litre Cosworth YB engine found itself present in the Sapphire RS Cosworth as found with the three-door Sierra.

==Sierras outside Europe==

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Sierra range featured both the five-door hatchback and station wagon bodies and production began at the Silverton (Pretoria) plant in January 1983. The restyled Sierra range differed from its European equivalent by featuring the traditional grille of the Sierra Sapphire saloon on the hatchback and wagon, though later, the grille would feature on these models in Europe. The saloon, introduced in South Africa only in the second quarter of 1989, was known simply as the &quot;Ford Sapphire&quot;.

Versions sold in South Africa were available with the 1.6 (Kent) and 2.0 (Pinto) four-cylinders, 2.3 V6 (Cologne) or 3.0-litre V6 (Essex) petrol engines. While the Cortina MkV in South Africa had retained the old 3.0 V6 Essex engine, the Sierra was initially given the new 2.3 V6 Cologne motor, this being fitted to the top-of-the-line model only. However, owing to the low cost of petrol, and the popularity of the old Cortina XR6, a Sierra XR6 was later launched, featuring the old Essex, initially producing .

Versions were LX, GL, and GLX; the Ghia trim level was not available for the South African market except on the Ford Sapphire, the saloon version.

As the 2.8/2.9 Cologne was never launched in South Africa, the venerable and popular Essex V6 remained the best normal production engine fitted to the Sierra. At the top of the range, the 2.3 GLS quickly gave way to a 3.0 GLX flagship model (producing less power but more torque than the XR6) and that was the end of the Cologne in South Africa, even the station wagon receiving the 3.0 V6 Essex. By 1985, the Sierra had become the largest Ford model in this market, following the demise of the Granada.

Towards the end of its production life, the Essex was modified again – the standard carburetted version was tuned to produce from 1991 to 1993, while a fuel-injected version was available from 1992 to 1993. Fitted to the Sierra as the 3.0i RS (replacing the XR6) and to the Sapphire saloon as the Sapphire Ghia (replacing the 3.0 GLX), the fuel-injected Essex put out around and was the most powerful Sierra/Sapphire version sold in South Africa, excluding the small number of XR8s built for homologation purposes. At the end of production a limited edition of 150 vehicles designated as 3.0i RS which based on the saloon (Sapphire) body was produced with some slight engine tweaks which resulted in a power output of . This vehicle was also fitted with the ATE ABS system as was customary only on the Sapphire GHIA models at the time. These limited-edition vehicles were available in only two colours, namely red and white.
Uniquely, the South African market also saw the introduction of a 5.0-litre XR8 between June 1984 and 1988. A limited number of 250 Sierras were made for the purposes of homologation, as this model was the premier Ford used in Group-A racing. The XR8 was fitted with the 302 ci engine from the US Ford Mustang, and the Borg Warner T5 heavy-duty transmission. Front brakes were AP Racing four-piston calipers on 280 mm discs. Maximum power is and a top speed of was claimed. The XR8 is easily recognized by having four cooling slats between the headlights, whereas lesser versions were sold with the original smooth front.

The 1.6 Kent continued almost unchanged during the 9-year life of the Sierra/Sapphire, while the 2.0 Cologne was revised several times, being fitted to the Sierra 2.0 GL and GLE and later to the stripped down Sierra 2.0 LX and Sapphire 2.0 GL and GLE models. It eventually even received fuel injection in the Sapphire 2.0GLi, boosting the power from to .

The Sierra was eventually replaced in South Africa by the Telstar in 1993. Samcor, which assembled Ford models under licence after Ford had divested from the country, was already assembling the smaller Laser and Meteor, alongside the Mazda 323, on which they were based, as well as a facelifted earlier version of the Mazda 626. The Telstar was finally replaced by the Mondeo in 1998.

===New Zealand===
Whereas British buyers rued the absence of a saloon version of the Sierra, in New Zealand it was the absence of an estate that customers missed, when Ford New Zealand replaced the Cortina with the Ford Telstar range. In order to fill the gap in the market, Ford introduced the Sierra wagon in 1984, in spite of opposition at Ford Asia Pacific and from the Detroit headquarters. This was assembled locally from imported CKD (&quot;completely knocked down&quot;) kits. The wagon was offered in 1.6- (base) and 2.0-litre &quot;L&quot; and &quot;Ghia&quot; models initially, and proved to be a strong seller. The then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Muldoon, used a Sierra as his personal transport (though it was a specially imported one-off hatchback version) and would drive it to his office in the government building known as the Beehive. New Zealand was the only market in the world where both the Telstar and the Sierra were offered next to each other.

A first facelift c. 1985 aligned the frontal appearance of all models and the three-speed automatic option was replaced by Ford’s new A4LD four-speed unit. A 1987 facelift again changed frontal appearance, among other updates, and the range was rationalized to the single L trim level. In one month that year, single estate model line was the country&#x27;s top-selling car range. A few fully built-up 2.3 V6 five-doors and XR4i three-doors were also imported from 1984.

However, Ford cancelled the Sierra once Mazda, which developed the Telstar, could offer a estate. The Telstar estate, while popular, never reached the Sierra&#x27;s heights, especially its competition successes overseas. Further reasons could be customers&#x27; knowledge of the Telstar&#x27;s Japanese roots, and that the equivalent Mazda 626 wagon offered a considerably longer warranty at a similar price.

Relative rejection of the Telstar forced Ford to import completely built-up (CBU) premium models built in Genk, Belgium from 1990: the Sierra 2.0 GLX Wagon, the Sierra Sapphire 2.0 Ghia and the XR4×4 were part of this range. The advertising copy read &quot;Introducing the new car that needs no introduction&quot;. However, a relatively high price did not help – the Wagon began at over NZ$31,000 – and production errors in the launch brochure showed cars with no steering wheels. Furthermore, any marketing boosts Ford could have gained through Group A touring car racing were over with the Escort Cosworth becoming the company&#x27;s standard-bearer in competition (and the Escort, meanwhile, was absent from the New Zealand market).

The Sierra was withdrawn from the New Zealand market in 1992, and it was another five years before its European successor the Mondeo arrived there. Sierra Cosworths remain sought-after performance cars.

By contrast, the Sierra was never sold in Australia, as there was less demand for a medium-sized wagon than in New Zealand, although the RS Cosworth/RS500 was used in the Australian Touring Car Championships from the late-1980s and early-1990s.

===Argentina===
In Argentina, the Sierra was offered as a five-door hatchback beginning in the summer of 1984. An estate body style was added in September 1985. The sporting XR4, with three-door bodywork arrived a couple of months after the original introduction. The facelifted post-1987 model did not reach the Argentinian market, where the range continued with a Merkur XR4Ti-like grille until 1991 for XR4 and 1992 for five-door models, when it was replaced by the Volkswagen Santana-based Galaxy. Argentinian Sierras can be distinguished by a more sculpted front bumper with an extra cooling inlet.

The 1.6L was offered in GL model only, while the LX, Ghia, Ghia S/SX, and XR4 were available with a 2.3-litre inline-four with some differences in specs. Both engines, as for the preceding Taunus TC3, were from the &quot;Pinto&quot; family. The power ranged between for the 1.6 and for the XR4 and later Ghia S versions. Some Ghia models also featured automatic transmission as an optional. The estate was called the Sierra Rural. Ford had previously used the name &quot;Rural&quot; for estates in Argentina, such as the Taunus, in a similar way to &quot;Turnier&quot; in Germany.

The GL model was the base model replaced by the LX with the same equipment. The XR4 was eventually complemented by the five-door Ghia S/SX.

===Venezuela===

In Venezuela the locally assembled Ford Sierra was launched in 1985, the 2.8 L V6 engine being standard on versions sold there, including the 5 door hatchback (280 LS and 280ES) and 3 door hatchback (XR4i and 280GT) as well as the 5-door estate (Ranchera). In 1990, a face-lifted version of the Sierra, powered by the 2.9 L V6 engine was offered as both a hatchback and a saloon, the latter being known as the Sierra 300 Sapphire, although unlike the Sapphire in other markets it had a blanked-off grille. Also launched in Venezuela was the XR6i.

===North America===
In North America, the Ford Sierra was offered under the now defunct Merkur brand, imported from Germany as a three-door hatchback and marketed as the XR4Ti. The North American market had already seen the similar-sounding Oldsmobile Ciera, and the &quot;Sierra&quot; name was trademarked by General Motors Corporation from the 1970s as a trim level on its pickup trucks.

The XR4Ti was offered from the start of the Merkur brand in 1985 until 1989, equipped as a rear-wheel-drive 2.3-litre SOHC inline four-cylinder (commonly known as the &quot;Lima&quot; engine) equipped with a Garrett T3 turbocharger and fuel injection. The engine produced and was largely the same engine as was available in the Mustang, where it produced thanks to the fitment of an intercooler.

Negatively affecting the XR4Ti&#x27;s popularity, North American safety and emissions regulations (including requiring air bags for all 1990 and newer vehicles, not required in foreign markets), forced costly homologation modifications, resulting in relatively high pricing. Exchange rates also fluctuated frequently. Moreover, since Merkurs were sold at Lincoln–Mercury dealers, many customers were more attracted towards Mercury models, such as the Mercury Sable, which were similarly styled and had similar equipment for significantly lower prices.

==Mechanicals==
Unlike many of its rivals, the Sierra retained rear-wheel drive, albeit with a modern fully independent rear suspension, departing from the Cortina&#x27;s live axle.

===4-cylinder engines===

In the beginning the Sierra used engines and transmissions from the Taunus / Cortina. The engines were of two types, the SOHC Ford Pinto engine in 1.3, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0-litre displacements, and the OHV Cologne V6 engine (in 2.0, 2.3, 2.8, and 2.9-litre capacities). Towards the end of the 1980s owing to tightening emission standards, the Pinto engine began to be phased out, the 1.8-litre in 1988 replaced by a 1.8-litre CVH, the 2.0-litre in 1989, replaced with the Ford I4 DOHC engine. In anticipation of the Euro 1 emission standard (applicable from 1st January 1993), buyers from late 1991 had the option of a 1.6 CVH first seen in the Escort in 1980, described as a &quot;CFi&quot;, a single-point fuel injection system with a catalytic converter. Carburettor-fed 1.6 Sierras with no catalytic converter still used the Pinto engine, which remained available through 1992 before stocks ran out at the end of that year. In the UK, Ford allegedly pre-registered any remaining non-catalysed cars to ensure they could still be legally sold beyond 1992.

===6-cylinder engines===

The 2.9 L Cologne engine was available in the Sierra XR4x4 and the Sierra Ghia. Models with the 2.0-litre and Cologne V6 engines had an option of a limited slip differential. Models built until 1989 used the type 9 gearbox that had been used in the Cortina, with the exception of 2WD Cosworth models that used the T5. The T5 had several variations; most were internal. This was basically the same transmission used in the Ford Mustang. The 0.80 overdrive gears were the weak link. It was later superseded by the MT75 unit (for DOHC, 4X4 and V6 models). All Sierras had rear drum brakes, except sporting models (2.0iS (some), 2.0 GLX &amp; GLS, XR4x4, Sierra Cosworth, other special/sporting models inc 2.0i 4x4) and models with anti-lock brakes. American versions meanwhile were sold only with a 2.3-litre four-cylinder turbocharged version of the Pinto engine.

===Diesel engines===

The Sierra also had a diesel option on the engine, namely at launch the 2.3-litre normally aspirated Indenor diesel made by Peugeot. This engine was also used in contemporary Granadas and whilst reliable and economical it made an unrefined noisy and very slow vehicle, but remained a popular option for taxi firms. This was later superseded in 1990 by a 1.8 L turbocharged powerplant of Ford&#x27;s own design which offered better response times and slightly more power. During the Sierra&#x27;s production run the engine was known both as the Lynx and as the Endura-D, though was further rebranded as the &#x27;Endura-DE&#x27; with the release of the second-generation Ford Mondeo.

==Special-edition models==
In 1983, the high-performance XR4i version was introduced. It used the same 2.8 L Cologne engine as used in the Ford Capri 2.8 Injection of that era and sported a restyled version of the 3-door Sierra bodyshell. The double rear spoiler and curious multi-pillared rear windows were considered over-styled by some prospective buyers, and the car never achieved the cult status of the smaller Fiesta XR2 and Escort XR3i. A version of the XR4i with a 2.3 L turbocharged engine was sold in the United States as the Merkur XR4Ti. The XR4Ti was raced in Europe, most notably by Andy Rouse who used one to win the 1985 BTCC.
In South Africa, there was a 3.0 L V6 version, called the XR6, also made in South Africa was a limited run of 250 V8 XR8s for saloon car racing homologation in 1984. These were based on the Ford Windsor 302 engine.

In 1985 the XR4i was replaced by the XR4x4, which was based on the five-door hatchback, had four-wheel drive and was powered by the same 2.8-litre V6 engine but wasn&#x27;t equipped with the biplane rear spoiler. Only a very limited number of three-door XR4x4&#x27;s have been built. By the end of its production in 1990, 23,540 had been produced. From 1990 to 1993 the XR4x4 was available with both the revised 2.9 EFi and 2.0 DOHC EFi engines. The XR4i also made a reappearance (as a badging exercise) in 5-door form but with the DOHC 2.0 engine instead of the V6.

In 1989, Ford nodded towards its past and created the Sierra 2.0i 2000E, a model name used with limited success on the Mk3 Cortina. The Sierra 2000E had two-tone metallic paint, alloys, light grey leather interior, and a trip computer in addition the standard features on the &#x27;Ghia&#x27; models. It was available only in saloon form and a limited number of models were sold between 1989 and 1991. Ford used this to showcase the new DOHC twin-cam engine which was also released in 1989.

In Argentina the non-injected XR4 model was equipped with the Taunus 2.3 engine and was produced between 1986 and 1991. In this market the most direct rival was the Renault Fuego 2.2.

In July 1986, a special version called the Ford Sierra RS Cosworth was launched, using the 2.0 OHC bottom end with a 16V DOHC cylinder head specially developed by Cosworth. With the Cosworth Garret T3 turbocharger and intercooler setup the engine produced . It was designed by Ford&#x27;s Special Vehicle Engineering (SVE) group and made in Ford&#x27;s Genk factory in Belgium for use in group A. It was based on a three-door Sierra with the dashboard from the Merkur XR4Ti. The car was available in only white, black, or Ford&#x27;s &#x27;Moonstone Blue&#x27; and only 5545 were made. The Sierra RS Cosworth was available in both right-hand drive and left-hand drive, the RS500 was produced only in right-hand drive. Racing conversions were done with the European Merkur dashboard.

In 1987, a Sierra Cosworth, the RS500, was sold alongside the regular version. Only 500 were produced as the minimum number of road-going cars required to meet with newly introduced homologation racing rules, allowing it to compete in evolution form for group-A racing. The car was modified by the Tickford Engineering Company in conjunction with Ford. Revisions included uprated brakes and larger brake cooling ducts and modified front and rear spoilers (a second smaller rear spoiler was added beneath the large &quot;whale-tail&quot;), a modified front bumper to allow extra cooling for a larger intercooler, as well as various engine upgrades including a larger turbocharger and a second fuel rail (which did not operate on road models). Race outputs were as high as , in which the Sierra dominated group-A series around the world.

Racing versions of the Cosworth were highly successful in European and World Touring Car racing throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the RS500 helped Ford to win the manufacturer&#x27;s title in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship. Ford was forced to fall back on the Sierra for rallying from 1987, after the banning of the Group B formula. With only rear drive, the Sierra struggled to compete on looser surfaces but was very quick on asphalt, Didier Auriol winning his first World Championship rally in a Sierra in Corsica, 1988. It was replaced by the 4x4 Sapphire version from 1990, which never managed to win a World Championship event but became a popular and successful car in national championships. The Sierra was replaced by the Escort Cosworth in 1993.

In 1988, a new Cosworth was produced which was based on the Sierra Sapphire saloon. 13,140 were produced until it was replaced in 1990 by a four-wheel-drive version, the Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth 4x4, of which 12,250 were built. Its replacement came in the form of the Escort RS Cosworth which appeared in 1992, which used a shortened and developed version of the Sierra platform and running gear but clothed with an Escort-esque bodyshell and the return of the whale-tail spoiler.

==Turbocharged versions==
Turbocharged versions of the Sierra were also available as post-production models from companies like Janspeed and, most notably, from Turbo Technics. The XR4x4 2.8 was available with a range of aftermarket kits pushing power from to over . The 2.9 got a twin-turbo setup, available with variants up to . Even the DOHC version got a single turbo kit, of which only a small number were made. Turbo Technics even sold their own pre-prepared Sierra known as the Minker; only a handful were ever produced, as they cost significantly more than Ford&#x27;s own RS Cosworth.

In Finland, tax laws made the 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre-engined Sierras attractive business cars in the mid 1980s. Beginning in 1982, a number of these smaller engines were turbocharged locally in order to gain 2.0 L engine power without moving into the higher tax bracket. The 2.0 L OHC engine was also available turbocharged. These are often called &quot;Stockmann Turbo&quot; Sierras, after the provider of the most popular conversion kits. After stricter emissions standards were introduced for 1989, Stockmann focused on getting the more popular 1.6-litre kit approved and stopped offering the other ones. They were not intended as sporting cars, but were &quot;tax specials&quot; meant to save owners money without sacrificing power. The purchase price of a 1.6 Turbo was marginally higher than that of a factory 2.0, but the difference was quickly made up in tax savings.

==Changes during production life==
After the major facelift of 1987, and the introduction of the DOHC engines in 1989, further changes to the Sierra were superficial. Some detail styling changes were made in 1990, when the dashboard styling was freshened up, the front was given clear-lensed indicators, the rear given smoked rear lamp lenses, the steering wheel redesigned, and a new front grille was added, together with fuel injection as standard, 15-inch wheels and rear disc brakes. UK production of the Sierra ceased in 1990 with right-hand-drive production moving to Belgium.

During the 1992 model year, the 1.6-litre Pinto engine was finally dropped (as it was not re-engineered for the upcoming Euro 1 emissions legislation) and replaced by a CVH unit of similar capacity, marking the end of the venerable Pinto unit after it had been introduced in the Cortina/Taunus some 21 years earlier. The 1992 model year cars saw the final revisions – most notably to the dashboard which gained a more rounded instrument binnacle similar in style to the 1990 Escort and Orion, along with specification, colour, and trim upgrades across the range.

By 1989, Ford had confirmed that the successor to the Sierra (due by 1993) would feature front-wheel drive, and a number of concept cars were shown in the motoring press, hinting at what the new car might look like. It had become clear that the Sierra had fallen out of step technologically against modern Japanese rivals which offered multi-valve engines and multi-link rear suspension. All of these features appeared on the Sierra&#x27;s replacement, the front-wheel-drive Mondeo, which was unveiled in November 1992 and went on sale the following March.

==Popularity==
The Sierra is the tenth most popular car to have been sold in Britain, with 1,299,993 units having been sold. The first Sierras were sold in October 1982, and stocks lasted for around two years after the end of production – with more than 200 models being sold in 1994 and at least one example being sold in 1995 (in February as an M-registered model).

The Sierra remained a common sight on the roads in the United Kingdom and several other European countries, and a popular second-hand buy, until well into the 21st century. However, just 2,425 Ford Sierras were reported to be taxed and still on UK roads in December 2019, with 11,562 currently SORN.

<text>A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that comes true at least in part as a result of a person&#x27;s belief or expectation that the prediction would come true. In the phenomena, people tend to act the way they have been expected to in order to make the expectations come true. Self-fulfilling prophecies are an example of the more general phenomenon of positive feedback loops. A self-fulfilling prophecy can have either negative or positive outcomes. Merely applying a label to someone or something can affect the perception of the person/thing and create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Interpersonal communication plays a significant role in establishing these phenomena as well as impacting the labeling process.

American sociologists W. I. Thomas and Dorothy Swaine Thomas were the first Western scholars to investigate this phenomenon. In 1928, they developed the Thomas theorem (also known as the Thomas dictum): &quot;If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.&quot; Another American sociologist, Robert K. Merton, continued the research, and is credited with coining the term &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot; and popularizing the idea that &quot;a belief or expectation, correct or incorrect, could bring about a desired or expected outcome.&quot; The works of philosophers Karl Popper and Alan Gerwith also contributed to the idea.

==History==
An early precursor of the concept appears in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;: &quot;During many ages, the prediction, as it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment&quot;.

The phrase &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot; was coined by Robert K. Merton, a sociologist who also developed the ideas of anomie, social structure, and the modes of individual adaption. In his book &quot;Social Theory and Social Structure&quot;, he uses the example of a bank run to show how self-fulfilling thoughts can make unwanted situations happen. In his illustration, rumors spread about the town that the local bank is going to file for bankruptcy, causing many people to rush to the bank and close their accounts. Because banks do not keep their total assets in cash, the bank was unable to fulfill all its customers&#x27; withdrawals, which eventually caused the bank to go bankrupt. Merton concludes with the analysis, &quot;The prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfillment&quot;.

While Merton&#x27;s example focused on self-fulfilling prophecies within a community, self-fulfilling prophecies also apply to individuals, as individuals often conform to the expectations of others. This is also known as the Pygmalion effect, based on the experiments by Robert Resenthal and Lenore Jacobson, where teachers were told that a random selection of students were expected to perform exceptionally well; those students showed a significant increase in test scores at the end of the year.

Philosopher Karl Popper called the self-fulfilling prophecy the &quot;Oedipus effect&quot;:

The idea is similar to that discussed by the philosopher William James as &quot;The Will to Believe.&quot; But James viewed it positively, as the self-validation of a belief.

==Applications==
Examples abound in studies of cognitive dissonance theory and the related self-perception theory; people will often change their attitudes to come into line with what they profess publicly.

In the United States, the concept was broadly and consistently applied in the field of public education reform, following the &quot;War on Poverty&quot;, as teacher expectations have been shown to influence student academic performance. Theodore Brameld noted: &quot;In simplest terms, education already projects and thereby reinforces whatever habits of personal and cultural life are considered to be acceptable and dominant.&quot; The effects of teacher attitudes, beliefs, and values, affecting their expectations have been tested repeatedly, most notably in the Pygmalion in the Classroom study, where teachers were told arbitrarily that random students were likely to show significant intellectual growth. As a result, those random students actually ended the year with significantly greater improvement when given another IQ test. Though the changes may be subconscious, teachers who have higher expectations typically give &quot;more time to answer questions, more specific feedback, and more approval&quot;. Likewise, students who have positive experiences with their teachers may study more. Academic self-fulfilling prophecies can be negative, however: one study indicated that female students may perform worse if they expect their male instructor to be sexist.

The phenomenon of the &quot;inevitability of war&quot; is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has received considerable study.

Fear of failure leads to deterioration of results, even if the person is objectively able to adequately cope with the problem. For example, fear of falling leads to more falls among older people.

Americans of Chinese and Japanese origin are more likely to die of a heart attack on the 4th of each month, due to the number four being considered unlucky and a portent of death.

Moore&#x27;s law predicting that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years is often considered as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The belief that a bank is insolvent may help create the fact, but confidence in the bank&#x27;s prospects may improve them. Similarly, stock-exchange panics and speculative bubbles can be both triggered by a widespread belief that the stock will go down (or up), thus starting the selling/buying mass move, etc.

People adapt to the judgments and assessments made by society, regardless of whether they were originally correct or not. There are certain prejudices against a socially marginalized group (e.g., homeless people, drug addicts or other minorities), and therefore, people in this marginalized group actually begin to behave in accordance with expectations.

=== Relationships ===

A leading study by Columbia University found that self-fulfilling prophecies have some part in relationships: the beliefs by people in relationships can impact the likelihood of a breakup or the overall health of the relationship. L. Alan Sroufe suggested that &quot;rejection expectations can lead people to behave in ways that elicit rejection from others.&quot; The study looked at the inner workings behind the role of self-fulfilling prophecies in romantic relationships of people who were deemed high in rejection sensitivity, which was defined as &quot;the disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and overreact to rejection&quot;. The study found that women were more likely to experience rejection sensitivity in comparison to the negativity held by men about the future of their relationships, and that women sensitive to rejection &quot;may be more likely to behave in ways that exacerbate conflicts,&quot; which could lead to behavior that would &quot;erode their partners&#x27; relationship satisfaction and commitment.&quot;

Other specific examples discussed in psychology include:
* &quot;Clever Hans&quot; effect
* Observer-expectancy effect
* Hawthorne effect
* Placebo effect
* Nocebo effect
* Pygmalion effect
* Stereotype threat

=== International relations ===
Self-fulfilling prophecies have been apparent throughout history with the &#x27;Thucydides trap&#x27;: the occurrence of a rising power threatening a ruling or dominant power. Thuycidides was an Athenian historian and general who recorded the Peloponnesian war between Sparta and Athens. He wrote, &quot;It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.&quot;

Another example of self-fulfilling prophecies is the United States&#x27; invasion of Iraq in 2003. The invasion was based on the assumption that Iraq posed a terrorist threat to the United States, though evidence shows that no threat was actually posed. The invasion and subsequent overthrowing of the regime resulted in Iraq becoming a stronghold for the terrorist organization Al Qaeda, thus fulfilling the initial belief of a potential threat.

==Stereotype==
Self-fulfilling prophecies are one of the main contributions to racial prejudice and vice versa. According to the &quot;Dictionary of Race, Ethnicity &amp; Culture,&quot; &quot;Self-fulfilling prophecy makes it possible to highlight the tragic vicious circle which victimizes people twice: first, because the victim is stigmatized with an inherent negative quality; and secondly, because he or she is prevented from disproving this quality.&quot; An example is given where white workers expected that black people would be against the principles of trade unionism because they considered black workers to be &quot;undisciplined in traditions of trade unionism and the art of collective bargain-ing.&quot; Due to this belief, black workers were not hired at white-owned businesses, which made black workers unable to learn the principles of trade unionism, and thus prevented them from unionizing.

Teachers can encourage stereotype-based courses and can interact with students in a manner that encourages self-fulfilling thoughts: for example, female students may seem to be bad at math if teachers never encouraged them to improve their mathematical abilities.

The term &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot; made its first appearance in educational literature in the 1960s, when African-American psychologist Kenneth B. Clark studied the responses of black children to black and white dolls. The responses from Clark&#x27;s study ranged from some children calling the black doll ugly to one girl bursting into tears when prompted to pick the doll she identified with. The black children internalized the inferiority they learned and acted accordingly. Clark, whose work pushed the Supreme Court to desegregate schools, noted the influence of teachers on the achievement levels between Black and White students. This prompted Clark to begin a study in ten inner-city schools where he assessed the attitudes and behaviors of teachers. The belief held by teachers was that minority students were unintelligent, and therefore the teachers put no effort into teaching them. This led to a feedback loop of those students not being educated, and thus being perceived as unintelligent.

==Literature, media, and the arts==

In literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as plot devices. They have been used in stories for millennia, but are especially popular in science fiction and fantasy. They are often used for dramatic irony, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the attempts to prevent the prophecy. They are also sometimes used as comic relief.

===Classical===
Many myths, legends, and fairy-tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate inexorable fate, fundamental to the Hellenic world-view. In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen, but the prophesied events come about as a result of the actions taken to prevent them.

====Greek====
The word &quot;prophet&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;prophete&quot;, meaning &quot;one who speaks for another.&quot;
The best-known example from Greek legend is that of Oedipus. Warned that his child would one day kill him, Laius abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. He sought to avoid this, and, believing his foster parents to be his real parents, left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, killed him, and married his widow, only to discover that the stranger he had killed was his biological father, and his new wife was his biological mother.

Although the legend of Perseus opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather Acrisius, the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act that could have happened regardless of Acrisius&#x27; response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is due to his hearing of the prophecy. In still others, Acrisius is one of the wedding guests when Polydectes tries to force Danaë to marry him, and is accidentally killed when Perseus turns all the guests to stone with the Gorgon&#x27;s head.

Greek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king Croesus asked the Delphic Oracle if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked, only to fail—the kingdom he destroyed was his own.

When it was predicted that Cronos would be overthrown by his son, and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, Cronus ate his children, each shortly after they were born, enraging his wife, Rhea. To get revenge, when she bore Zeus, she gave Cronos a stone to eat instead, sending Zeus to be raised by Amalthea. Cronos&#x27; attempt to avoid the prophecy made Zeus his enemy, ultimately leading to its fulfilment.

====Roman====

The story of Romulus and Remus is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him as he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the Tiber River. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they discovered their heritage, and killed their uncle in revenge, fulfilling the prophecy.

====Arabic====
A variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval Arabic literature. Several tales in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, also known as the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, use this device to foreshadow what is going to happen, as a special form of literary prolepsis. A notable example is &quot;The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream&quot;, in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of Baghdad and travel to Cairo, where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in English folklore as the &quot;Pedlar of Swaffham&quot;.

Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in &quot;The Tale of Attaf&quot;, where Harun al-Rashid consults his library (the House of Wisdom), reads a random book, &quot;falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful &quot;vizier&quot;&quot; Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya from sight. Ja&#x27;far, &quot;disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in Damascus, involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.&quot; After returning to Baghdad, Ja&#x27;far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun&#x27;s reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of reverse causality. In the 12th century, this tale was translated into Latin by Petrus Alphonsi and included in his &quot;Disciplina Clericalis&quot;. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot; and Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot;.

====Hinduism====

Self-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical Sanskrit literature. In the story of Krishna in the Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the ruler of the Mathura kingdom, Kamsa, afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister Devaki&#x27;s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki&#x27;s apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents Yashoda and Nanda in the village of Gokula. Years later, Kamsan learned about the child&#x27;s escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother Balarama. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kamsa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kamsa&#x27;s attempts to prevent the prophecy that it came true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

====Ruthenian====
Oleg of Novgorod was a Varangian prince who ruled over the Rus people during the early tenth century. As old East Slavic chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg&#x27;s stallion would be the source of Oleg&#x27;s death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told that it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse&#x27;s skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the Primary Chronicle, Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by Alexander Pushkin in his celebrated ballad &quot;The Song of the Wise Oleg&quot;. In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of Orvar-Odd.

====European fairy-tales====
Many fairy-tales, such as &quot;The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs&quot;, &quot;The Fish and the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars&quot;, or &quot;The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate&quot;, feature a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl will marry a rich boy). This is story type 930 in the Aarne–Thompson classification scheme. The girl&#x27;s father&#x27;s efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.

Another fairy-tale occurs with older children. In &quot;The Language of the Birds&quot;, a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son&#x27;s servant. In &quot;The Ram&quot;, the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In both, the father takes the child&#x27;s response as evidence of malice and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child&#x27;s servant.

In some variants of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, such as &quot;Sun, Moon, and Talia&quot;, the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.

====Shakespeare====
Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but that the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Spurred by the prophecy, Macbeth kills the king and his own friend, something he arguably would not have done otherwise, leading to a revolution against him, and his death. The later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should &quot;Beware Macduff&quot; is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff&#x27;s family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.

===Modern===
====New age religion====
The law of attraction is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that &quot;like attracts like&quot; and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results. According to this law, all things are created first by imagination, which leads to thoughts, then to words and actions. The thoughts, words and actions held in mind affect someone&#x27;s intentions which makes the expected result happen. Although there are some cases where positive or negative attitudes can produce corresponding results (principally the placebo and nocebo effects), there is no scientific basis to the law of attraction.

==Sports==
Some researchers from 2008 found that in basketball, the head coaches gave more biased feedback while the assistant coaches gave more critical feedback. They predicted this was due to the external expectations from the coaches to the athletes which could have resulted in the Pygmalion effect with positive and negative results.

Researcher Helen Brown published findings of two experiments performed on athletes, investigating the effect that the media has on them, and concluded that the athlete&#x27;s performance was impacted by and aligned with expectations of their performance. A follow-up experiment in London found that such expectations can impact their judgement and thought processes, and can even have a dangerous and destructive impact on some athletes.

==Causal loop==

A self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop. Predestination does not necessarily involve a supernatural power, and could be the result of other &quot;infallible foreknowledge&quot; mechanisms. Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in Newcomb&#x27;s paradox. A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, in which Oedipus becomes the king of Thebes, whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling. The movie &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; heavily deals with themes of predestination and the Cassandra complex, where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he cannot change the past.

<doc id="232450" wikidata="Q5135451" url="?curid=232450" title="Closing the Gaps">
<text>Closing the Gaps was a policy of the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand for assisting socio-economically disadvantaged Māori and Pasifika ethnic groups in New Zealand through specially targeted social programmes. The phrase &quot;Closing the Gaps&quot; was a slogan of the Labour Party in the 1999 election campaign and was implemented as a policy initiative in the 2000 Budget.

== Overview ==
The aim of Closing the Gaps was to reduce the most visible disparities in socio-economic status and opportunity between Māori and Pacific Islander groups and other groups. The policy had a social development and social inclusion approach to social policy. Closing the Gaps aimed to balance individual and collective rights and responsibilities by integrating Māori and Pacific Islanders more extensively into the paid labour market.

== Context ==
The socio-economic gaps between Māori and non-Māori stem from a history of colonialism. Land alienation and the Māori labour migration resulted in structural inequalities in socio-economic status between Māori and non-Māori, a central concern of Closing the Gaps. These inequalities were exacerbated by the neoliberal policy reforms pursued by the Fourth Labour and Fourth National governments. Increasing inequality throughout the 1980s and 90s disproportionately affected Māori and Pacific Islanders, who were over-represented at the bottom of New Zealand&#x27;s socio-economic landscape.

Closing the Gaps was a policy typical of Third Way political philosophy, popular throughout the West in the early 2000s. Third Way politics reconciles neoliberalism with social democratic ideals to mitigate the inequalities caused by neoliberal economic and political systems. Hence, Closing the Gaps is recognizant of the global political context it inhabited.

Closing the Gaps was a direct response to the findings of the 1998 Te Puni Kōkiri report &quot;Progress Towards Closing the Social and Economic Gaps Between Māori and non-Māori&quot;, which outlined these accumulating inequalities Māori and Pacific Islanders encountered. The report&#x27;s overall findings revealed the gaps between Māori and non-Māori in education, employment, economic and health status were significant. Furthermore, the report revealed these gaps had stabilized or were widening, not reducing. The Closing the Gaps report was the first government publication to measure inequalities between Māori and non-Māori, both setting a benchmark for policy, and providing an impetus for the Fifth Labour-led Government to reduce inequality.

== Policy outline ==

*Investment in schools, polytechnics, universities, housing agencies and hospitals.
*Investment in Māori and Pacific Islander controlled and managed organisations.
*$12 million in additional funding to Te Puni Kōkiri over four years to improve the government&#x27;s information base and monitoring capability in order to more effectively measure outcomes of social policy programmes for Māori.
*Departmental chief executives required to disclose in their annual reports the steps taken in their departments towards closing socio-economic gaps between Māori and Pacific Islanders and others.
*$114 million towards capacity building initiatives for Māori and Pacific Islander communities.
*$8 million in additional funding to the Māori Land Court over four years.
*Creation of a provisional fund of $50 million for Closing the Gaps initiatives developed between budgets.

== Public opinion ==
Closing the Gaps was recognised as one of the foremost efforts of the 2000s to combat the heavy systemic racism Māori suffered in New Zealand. Doing so would promote equity for Māori, with the ultimate goal of totally equality. Naturally, however, the National Party led a campaign to stoke fears among its heavily European New Zealander base that the efforts were &quot;unfairly privileging&quot; Māori and &quot;threatening social cohesion&quot;. In June 2000, Winston Peters, leader of the New Zealand First party, described the program as &quot;social apartheid&quot;. The responses from the opposition and the public reflected the perspective that Māori rights under the Treaty of Waitangi were special privileges that actively excluded non-Māori from their rights and privileges as New Zealand citizens. The perspective that Māori were being unfairly privileged by Closing the Gaps gained popularity because the policy was portrayed as undermining an equality of opportunity approach to social policy that was popular in New Zealand.

Perspectives on Closing the Gaps was more varied within the Maori community. While the benefits Māori communities received from the policy led to Closing the Gaps being perceived positively by many Māori, critics argued the policy was ultimately damaging for Māori because it perpetuated negative stereotypes that normalised and reinforced Pākehā dominance. Māori Labour Party politicians promoted the policy as providing greater autonomy and self-determination for Māori under the partnership principle of the Treaty of Waitangi. Contrastingly, it was argued that by encouraging assimilation to Western values, Closing the Gaps continued to marginalise Māori culture by portraying Māoridom, and consequently Māori socio-economic disadvantage, as deviant. Additionally, a focus on individual responsibility for reducing socio-economic gaps was criticised for failing to recognise the government&#x27;s historical role as the excluding agent causing inequalities between Māori and non-Māori.

== Outcomes ==
Six months after the Labour-led Government was formed in late 1999, the term &quot;Closing the Gaps&quot; was no longer used in official documents. Opposition politicians observed that the Government still had a Closing the Gaps policy objective, but no longer referred to the policy by that name. Closing the Gaps was re-branded by the Government as &quot;reducing inequalities&quot;, in an attempt to make the policy more popular with the public.

Over the term of the 1999–2008 Labour Government, social statistics for Maori and Pacific Islanders did generally improve; however, the statistics for Pakeha New Zealanders showed a greater improvement, resulting in the &#x27;gaps&#x27; actually increasing. Closing the Gaps failed to reduce socio-economic inequalities between Māori and non-Māori and did not resolve structural inequalities that socio-economically excluded Māori from mainstream society.

After losing the 2002 election in a landslide, the opposition National Party campaigned, unsuccessfully, on a commitment to abolish Closing the Gaps and related affirmative action. In 2004 National leader Don Brash suggested all policies helping Māori become less disadvantaged should be abandoned, calling for abolition of the Māori electorates and Māori claims to customary title under the Treaty of Waitangi. Brash&#x27;s tactic was to claim erroneously that Māori were being afforded privileges that disadvantaged Pākehā. Closing the Gaps popularised a rhetoric of privilege in response to Treaty rights.

<text>Carlsberg Britvic is a British subsidiary of Carlsberg Group, created in January 2025 by the merger of Carlsberg&#x27;s UK business (including the former Marston&#x27;s plc breweries) and Britvic, acquired by Carlsberg Group in 2024.

==History==
In 2020, Marston&#x27;s plc merged its brewing business with Carlsberg UK (the United Kingdom arm of Carlsberg Group), in a joint venture valued at £780m. Marston&#x27;s took a 40% stake and received up to £273m in cash. The deal involved Marston&#x27;s six breweries and distribution depots, but not its 1,400 pubs. The merger was approved by the Competition and Markets Authority on 9 October 2020.

In 2024, Marston&#x27;s sold their 40% share in CMBC to Carlsberg for £206m in order to focus on running the pub business. The deal to acquire Marston&#x27;s 40% stake in CMBC was completed on 21 July 2024.

Carlsberg then bought the soft drinks company Britvic for £3.3bn, merging it into a single company called Carlsberg Britvic in January 2025.

==Operations==
===Beers===

The company owns and operates three breweries:

* The Banks&#x27;s Brewery in Wolverhampton.
* The Marston&#x27;s Brewery in Burton upon Trent.
* The Carlsberg Brewery in Northampton.

The brewery was one of the last major brewers to use Burton Union Sets, a system whereby fermentation barrels and troughs were linked together by pipework.

Half of all the company&#x27;s beer is bottled. Marston&#x27;s Pedigree is brewed in Burton-upon-Trent: it is a 4.3% ABV bitter. Introduced in 1952, it is Marston&#x27;s flagship brand, selling 150,000 hectolitres in 2010. It was the only beer to use the oak Burton Union System so that it was fermented in wood; the ingredients are mineral-enriched Burton Water, malted barley, and Fuggles and Goldings hops. The Burton Union sets were retired in 2024.

Marston&#x27;s had been brewing Thwaites&#x27; beers since early 2014 after Thwaites main brewery in Blackburn was shut down. Marston&#x27;s acquired Thwaites&#x27; main brewing arm, including the Wainwright brand, in March 2015 for £25.1 million.

Other beers distributed by the company include the 1664 brand, which was acquired from Heineken N.V. in June 2023.

===Soft drinks===
Soft drinks include Robinsons, Tango, R. White&#x27;s, and J2O.

==Sponsorship==
From 2007 to 2017, Marston&#x27;s sponsored the England and Wales Cricket Board and Marston&#x27;s Pedigree was the official beer of the England Cricket team. They were exclusive beer advertisers and suppliers at home test matches.

<text>Rizal, officially the Province of Rizal (), is a province in the Philippines located in the Calabarzon region in Luzon. Its capital is the city of Antipolo. It is about east of Manila. The province is named after José Rizal, one of the main national heroes of the Philippines. It is bordered by Metro Manila to the west, Bulacan to the north, Quezon to the east and Laguna to the southeast. The province also lies on the northern shores of Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country. Rizal is a mountainous province perched on the western slopes of the southern portion of the Sierra Madre mountain range.

Antipolo serves as the provincial capital since 2020, having been an administrative center since 2009 with the capitol located in the city. Previously, Pasig served as the capital, a designation it retained even after becoming part of the National Capital Region in 1975.

The province is a part of Greater Manila Area. It is the 5th largest province in the Philippines in terms of population.

==History==

===Early history===
Tagalog settlement arrived sometime in the pre-Spanish period. The provincial territory began with the organization of the Tondo and Laguna provinces during the Spanish administration. Some of the towns like Pasig, Parañaque, Taytay and Cainta were already thriving.

===Spanish colonial era===
From the reports of the &quot;Encomiendas&quot; in 1582–1583, the Encomiendas of &quot;Moron&quot; (Morong) was under the jurisdiction of La Laguna and, the Encomiendas of &quot;Passi&quot; (Pasig), &quot;Taitay&quot; (Taytay) and &quot;Tagui&quot; (Taguig) belonged to the Province of Tondo. It was recorded that in 1591, the Encomiendas of Moron and Taitay were under the jurisdiction of the Franciscan Order in the Province of La Laguna; and the Encomiendas of &quot;Nabotas&quot; (Navotas), &quot;Tambobo&quot; (Malabon), Tondo, Parañaque (then La Huerta, Parañaque), &quot;Longalo&quot; (Don Galo, Parañaque), Tagui and Pasig were under the jurisdiction of the Augustinians in the Province of Tondo.

In 1853, a new political subdivision named &quot;Distrito Politico-Militar de los Montes de San Mateo&quot; () was formed. This consisted of the towns of Antipolo, Bosoboso, Cainta and Taytay from the Province of Tondo, and the towns of Morong, Baras, Tanay, Pililla, Angono, Binangonan and Jala-jala from the Province of La Laguna, with Morong as the capital. This district was changed to &quot;Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong&quot; four years later.

By virtue of Circular No. 83, dated September 2, 1859, the Province of Tondo became the Province of Manila. All its towns were placed under the administration, fiscal supervision and control of the Governor of the new province.

The town of Mariquina (Marikina) became the capital of the Province of Manila during the tenure of the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. The Politico-Military District of Morong had for its capital the town of Antipolo from 1898 to 1899 and the town of Tanay from 1899 to 1900.

===American colonial era===
====Foundation====

On February 6, the First Philippine Commission sought to establish civil government in the country through a provincial organization act after the Filipino-Spanish and Filipino-American conflicts.

Therefore, on June 5, 1901, a historic meeting was held at the Pasig Catholic Church for the organization of a civil government in the Province of Manila and District of Morong, with 221 delegates in attendance. The first Philippine Commission, headed by William Howard Taft and composed of Commissioners Luke E. Wright, Henry C. Ide, Bernard Moses and Dean C. Worcester, discussed with the Assembly the issue of whether or not to write the Province of Manila with the District of Morong, was not self-sufficient to operate as a separate province.

Although the delegates from Morong, Hilarion Raymundo, and José Tupas, objected to the proposal, Juan Sumulong of Antipolo strongly advocated the move. After much acrimonious debate and upon the suggestion of Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera the body agreed on the creation of a new province independent of the Province of Manila. The new province was aptly named after José Rizal, the country&#x27;s national hero.
On June 11, 1901, the province of Rizal was officially and legally created by virtue of Act No. 137 by the First Philippine Commission which during the time was acting as the unicameral legislative body in the island of Luzon.

The new province was composed of 32 municipalities, 19 from the old Province of Manila (i.e. Cainta, Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malibay, Mariquina (Marikina), Montalban (Rodriguez), Muntinlupa, Navotas, Novaliches, Parañaque, Pasig, Pateros, Pineda (Pasay), San Felipe Neri (Mandaluyong), San Juan del Monte (San Juan), San Mateo, San Pedro Macati (Makati), Taguig, Tambobong (Malabon)); and 13 from the Politico-Military District of Morong (i.e. Angono, Antipolo, Baras, Binangonan, Bosoboso, Cardona, Jalajala, Morong, Pililla, Quisao, Tanay, Taytay and Teresa). The City of Manila from the old Province of Manila was treated as a separate entity. The seat of the provincial government was Pasig; however, for seven months in 1904, San Felipe Neri served as the provincial seat.

The number of municipalities changed with the municipal boundaries through time, mostly occurring within the provincial boundary. On October 12, 1903, the former municipalities of Bosoboso, Malibay, Novaliches and Quisao were absorbed by Antipolo, Pasay, Caloocan and Pililla, respectively, by virtue of Act No. 942. On November 25, 1903, Muntinlupa was ceded to the Province of La Laguna and became part of the municipality of Biñan, but was later returned to Rizal on March 22, 1905, and became part of Taguig until December 17, 1917.
On October 12, 1939, Quezon City was established, which included parts of Caloocan, and later on, Novaliches and parts of Marikina, Pasig and San Juan.

===Japanese occupation era===
Marking&#x27;s and the Hunter&#x27;s ROTC Guerrillas operated in Rizal Province throughout the war.

In 1942, Quezon City and the towns of Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Parañaque, Pasay, and San Juan were merged with Manila to form the City of Greater Manila, by virtue of Executive Order No. 400 signed by President Manuel L. Quezon as an emergency measure. The city was dissolved by President Sergio Osmeña in 1945, thus restoring the pre-war status of the merged cities and towns.

=== Philippine independence ===
Through Presidential Decree No. 824, Rizal was partitioned on November 7, 1975 to form Metropolitan Manila. The municipalities of Las Piñas, Parañaque, Muntinlupa, Taguig, Pateros, Makati, Mandaluyong, San Juan, Malabon, Navotas, Pasig and Marikina, and the three cities of Caloocan, Pasay and Quezon City were excised to form the new region, while the other 14 towns remained in Rizal.

=== Contemporary ===
On June 17, 2008, Governor Casimiro Ynares III announced the transfer of the provincial capitol from Pasig to Antipolo. The new capitol building, constructed by Ortigas &amp; Co., owner thereof, was completed by December of that year. Built on a lot near the Ynares Center, it was successfully inaugurated on March 4, 2009, bringing back the Capitol Building inside the provincial territory from which it was absent for 34 years (when Pasig was incorporated into Metro Manila).

On June 19, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11475 into law, which officially transferred the capital of the Rizal province from Pasig to Antipolo. The law was published on June 22, 2020, and took effect on July 7, 2020. The publication of the law coincided with the 159th birth anniversary of Rizal.

==Geography==
Rizal covers a total area of occupying the northern-central section of the Calabarzon in Luzon. The province is bordered on the north by Bulacan, east by Quezon, southeast by Laguna, south by Laguna de Bay, and west by Metro Manila.

Located east of Manila, commuters take approximately an hour to reach the provincial seat which is in Antipolo. Generally hilly and mountainous in terrain, most of the province&#x27;s southern towns lie in the shores of Laguna de Bay, the country&#x27;s largest inland body of water.

Talim Island, the largest island situated within Laguna de Bay, is under the jurisdiction of the province and shared by the municipalities of Binangonan and Cardona.

===Climate===
===Administrative divisions===
Rizal comprises 13 municipalities and 1 city.



==Demographics==
===Population===

The population of Rizal in the 2020 census was 3,330,143 people, with a density of .

===Languages===
Due to its location being in the heart of the Katagalugan, almost all of the residents of Rizal mainly speak Tagalog. English and Filipino are used as second languages respectively; Filipino is a version of Tagalog which is spoken by residents of Rizal in code switching &amp; when speaking to Tagalog speakers of other dialects. Being bordered by Metro Manila (whose majority of its cities were once part of Rizal), a large number of people from farther provinces have migrated to the province, resulting in minor but significant usage of the Bicolano, Cebuano, various Cordilleran languages, Cuyunon, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Kapampangan, Karay-a, Pangasinan and Waray, as well as various Lumad (indigenous languages in Mindanao) languages, Iranun, Maranao, Maguindanaon and Tausug languages.

Muslims, Anitists, animists, and atheists are also present in the province.
==Economy==
Before the 1990s, the primary source of economy in Rizal province were the huge piggery estates owned by Manila-based families. In recent years, the province became one of the most progressive provinces in the country, owing to its proximity to Metro Manila, the economic center of the Philippines. Antipolo, Taytay and Cainta serve as the economic centers of the province, while Angono, Rodriguez, Morong, San Mateo, Tanay, Binangonan and Teresa are taking successful steps to urbanize areas within their jurisdiction. Other areas of the province are having difficulty to start the urbanization process, mainly because of the lack of main roads to connect these to economic centers.

In a study recently conducted by the National Statistics Coordination Board (NSCB), Rizal province came out to be the Philippines&#x27; least poor province with a poverty incidence rate of 3.4%, even lower than that of the National Capital Region or Metro Manila. . On April 23, 2013, the National Statistics Coordination Board (NCSB) reported that Rizal, from being the least poor province in poverty incidence moved down to the 3rd Place, with Cavite taking over as the least province by 4.1% (compared to Rizal&#x27;s 7.6%) and Laguna for 2nd with 6.3%.

Antipolo, the province&#x27;s capital city, is the center of trade and exchange, tourism, government, and economy. It is also a center of education and sports because of the availability of various educational and physical training facilities. Acclaimed of its scenic attractions, the city also produces agricultural products such as cashew nuts and rice cakes. Taytay, the province&#x27;s center of garment and textile manufacturing, is also the town where the country&#x27;s largest mall operator runs a store near the town center. Meanwhile, Cainta serves as the center of business-process outsourcing (BPO) businesses in the province, aside from being known for the presence of several shopping centers and delicacies such as bibingka or rice cakes.

<text>The Custom House () is a neoclassical 18th century building in Dublin, Ireland which houses the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It is located on the north bank of the River Liffey, on Custom House Quay between Butt Bridge and Talbot Memorial Bridge.

==History==
===Origins===

A previous Custom House had been built in 1707 by engineer Thomas Burgh (1670–1730). However, by the late 18th century it was deemed unfit for purpose.

The building of a new Custom House for Dublin was the idea of John Beresford, who became the first commissioner of revenue for Ireland in 1780. In 1781 he appointed James Gandon as architect, after Thomas Cooley, the original architect on the project, had died. This was Gandon&#x27;s first large-scale commission. The new Custom House was unpopular with the Dublin Corporation and some city merchants who complained that it moved the axis of the city, would leave little room for shipping, and was being built on what at the time was a swamp and is detailed as reclaimed land on John Roque&#x27;s 1756 map of Dublin as being part of Amory&#x27;s Grant.

Purchase of land was delayed and proved exorbitant and the laying of foundations was disrupted by the High Sheriff and members of the Dublin Corporation with a mob of several thousand. However, Beresford was determined to complete the project and ignored the protests.

===Construction===
Construction started in 1781, and for his assistants, Gandon chose Irish artists such as Meath stone-cutter Henry Darley, mason John Semple and carpenter Hugh Henry. Every available mason in Dublin was engaged in the work. When it was completed and opened for business on 7 November 1791, it had cost £200,000 to build – a considerable sum at the time. The four facades of the building are decorated with coats-of-arms and ornamental sculptures (by Edward Smyth) representing Ireland&#x27;s rivers. Another artist, Henry Banks, was responsible for the statue on the dome and other statues.

The adjacent original Custom House Dock and swing bridge on the East side of the building were also designed by Gandon and completed slightly later in 1796. Along with George&#x27;s Dock, it later formed part of the Custom House Docks complex. The old dock was eventually filled in and the swing bridge was removed in the 1940s to be replaced by an extended quay and later to be replaced by Memorial Road.

===Use and redevelopment===

As the port of Dublin moved further downriver, the building&#x27;s original use for collecting customs duties became obsolete, and it was used as the headquarters of the Local Government Board for Ireland. 

During the Irish War of Independence in 1921, the Irish Republican Army burnt down the Custom House, to disrupt British rule in Ireland by destroying tax records. Gandon&#x27;s original interior was completely destroyed in the fire and the central dome collapsed. A large quantity of irreplaceable historical records were also destroyed in the fire. Despite achieving its objectives, the attack on the Custom House was a setback for the IRA as a large number of Volunteers were captured either during the attack or when falling back.

After the Anglo-Irish Treaty, it was restored by the Irish Free State government. The results of this reconstruction can still be seen on the building&#x27;s exterior today – the dome was rebuilt using Irish Ardbraccan limestone which is noticeably darker than the Portland stone used in the original construction. This was done to promote Irish resources.

Further restoration and cleaning of the stonework was done by an Office of Public Works (OPW) team in the 1980s.

In November 2021, a visitor experience opened at the Custom House, exploring the building, burning and restoration of the structure; it was developed by the OPW, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Fáilte Ireland.

<text>Cwmbran ( ; , also in use as an alternative spelling in English) is a town in the county borough of Torfaen in South Wales.

Lying within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire, Cwmbran was designated as a New Town in 1949 to provide new employment opportunities in the south eastern portion of the South Wales Coalfield.

==Geography==
Comprising the villages of Old Cwmbran, Pontnewydd, Upper Cwmbran, Henllys, Croesyceiliog, Llantarnam and Llanyrafon, its population had grown to 48,535 by 2011. This makes it the sixth largest urban area in Wales.

Sitting as it does at the corner of the South Wales Coalfield, it has a hilly aspect to its western and northern edges, with the surrounding hills climbing to over . The Afon Llwyd forms the major river valley, although the most significant water course is probably the remains of the Monmouthshire &amp; Brecon Canal. To the east of Cwmbran the land is less hilly, forming part of the Usk valley.

== Etymology ==
The name of the town in Welsh means &quot;valley () of the crow ()&quot;,).

Cwmbran was the name of one of several villages located in the valley, which had grown up around the tinplate works of the Cwmbran Iron Company. As the new town of Cwmbran was formed in 1949, the area of the old village became known as Old Cwmbran.

== History ==
Cwmbran was founded in 1949 as a new town, to provide new employment opportunities in the south eastern portion of the South Wales Coalfield, but the area has a long history.

There is evidence that Neolithic and Bronze Age people used the area, with the Iron Age Silures tribe also occupying the region before being subdued by the Roman legions based at nearby Usk and Caerleon.

Around 1179, Hywel, Lord of Caerleon gave a gift of money and land to found the Cistercian abbey at Llantarnam. At the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII the abbey was closed and was bought by a succession of wealthy landowners. By the 18th century the abbey had passed into the ownership of the Blewitt family, who were to become key figures in the early industrialisation of Cwmbran. Brick making, lime kilns, iron ore mining, quarrying and coal mining were established during this period, along with a canal to transport goods to the docks at Newport.

In 1833, the Ordnance Survey map of Monmouthshire shows Cwmbran as a farm situated in the area now known as Upper Cwmbran, in the valley named Cwm Brân. Cwmbran now covers about and has a population of around 50,000.

Following some investigation by local residents Richard Davies and Mike Price, the Ancient Cwmbran &amp; The Cistercian project was designed and created by Richard Davies and Torfaens Heritage Officer Claire Dovey-Evans. A £48,000 grant has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Torfaen Borough Council to explore some previously unrecorded sites of interest in Fairwater, Greenmeadow and Thornhill areas of Cwmbran. In a national Heritage Lottery Fund publication the project was described as exemplified community project.

The Cistercian Way also passes through Llantarnam, Old Cwmbran, Greenmeadow and Thornhill before reaching the ancient chapel of Llanderfel on Mynydd Maen, and then onwards to Twmbarlwm.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Cwmbran was the site of heavy industrial development. Coal and iron ore were extracted on Mynydd Maen, and moved by inclined planes and tramways into the Eastern Valley for use in factories such as the Patent Nut and Bolt Company (which became Guest Keen and Nettlefolds in 1900), various tin plate works and brickworks. This industry drove the creation of the Monmouthshire Canal, the Newport and Pontypool Railway and the Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway. Very little of this industrial heritage remains today, though many of today&#x27;s light industrial or retail estates were created on the sites.
Following the New Towns Act 1946, ministries and county councils were asked to nominate sites for housing. For Wales, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government proposed Church Village and Cwmbran. The Church Village proposal was vetoed by the Ministry of Power as new housing there would have interfered with plans for the expansion of coal mining in the area; however, Cwmbran was passed in 1949.

Cwmbran was a civil parish and, from 1974, a community in its own right, one of only five in the new district of Torfaen. In 1985, the Cwmbran community was abolished, replaced by Cwmbran Central, Fairwater, Llantarnam, Pontnewydd and Upper Cwmbran.

==Economy==
The longest established employer in Cwmbran is biscuit maker Burton&#x27;s Foods, who employ 1000 people to make its Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels biscuits. As of 2005, the Cwmbran plant produces over 400 million Wagon Wheels a year.

Safran Seats Great Britain (formerly Zodiac Aerospace) is the current owner of a factory in Cwmbran which employs 1000 people for manufacturing aircraft seats.

===Cwmbran Centre===
Constructed from 1959 to 1981, the pedestrianised Centre hosts supermarkets, high street retailers, banks, theatre, cinema, bowling alley, restaurants, creche, trampoline park, gym, police station, magistrates court, youth centre, pub, library, arts centre and office space. The 170+ shops can be accessed by the bus station located in the Centre, a train station a few minutes walk north-east or with the 3000 free parking spaces located around the Centre&#x27;s ring road.

SME-businesses include the Cwmbran Brewery in Upper Cwmbran, which opened in 1996 as Cottage Spring Brewery.

==Education==
The town has two secondary education schools: Croesyceiliog School and Cwmbran High School. There are numerous primary and nursery schools including a Welsh medium primary school, Ysgol Gymraeg Cwmbrân.

‘Crownbridge Special School’ is located in Cwmbran. Age range - 2–19 years old.

Further education, vocational training and some higher education is provided at Torfaen Learning Zone of Coleg Gwent in Cwmbran centre.

==Sport ==
Cwmbran Stadium is a multipurpose Stadium with an athletics track and 3G Pitch, an eight court sports hall, fitness suite, swimming pool and an indoor bowling rink.

=== Athletics ===
Cwmbran Stadium was home to international athletics events in the 1970s and 1980s. British athletics coach Malcolm Arnold used to train some of his athletes at Cwmbran in the 80s and early 90s while he was the Welsh National Coach.

Athletes who trained there regularly under Malcolm include former World 110m Hurdle Champion and World Record Holder, Colin Jackson; Commonwealth 110m Hurdle medallist, Paul Gray; and Nigel Walker who had two sporting careers, first as an Olympic hurdler and then later as a Welsh rugby union international player.

The 1999 World Indoor 400m Champion Jamie Baulch also used the stadium as a regular training track under a different coach. The stadium is also the home of Gwent Hockey Club (men&#x27;s and ladies).

The town has three athletics clubs: Cwmbran Harriers, Fairwater Runners and Griffithstown Harriers.

=== Football ===
The three main football teams in Cwmbran are Cwmbran Town, Cwmbran Celtic and Croesyceilog who all compete in the Welsh Football League. Cwmbran Town and Celtic both play at Cwmbran Stadium. Also in Cwmbran was The Football Factory. Located near to the town centre, The Football Factory was an indoor sports complex consisting of two sports pitches. The building was destroyed by fire in February 2017.

=== Rugby union ===
Separate grounds at Pontnewydd, Croesyceiliog and Glan-Yr-Afon Leisure Centre house the town&#x27;s three rugby union teams, Cwmbran RFC, Croesyceiliog RFC and Girling RFC.

Although many more of the town&#x27;s residents support the rugby teams of the older, adjacent town of Pontypool, the city of Newport and the Newport Gwent Dragons regional team.

=== Rugby league ===
Rugby league is represented in the town by Torfaen Tigers, who play in the fourth tier of the rugby league pyramid system, the Conference League South. They play their home matches at the Kings Head Ground, home of Cwmbran R.F.C.

The main newspaper in the region is the South Wales Argus and the semi-national Western Mail. The digital edition of the latter is published as Wales Online. The town is served by a local news service, Cwmbran Life, while the BBC also serve the South East Wales region from their base in Cardiff.

A number of online and amateur radio stations operate in Cwmbran. Vitalize Radio operates as the community radio station for Torfaen, originally established in 2014 as Torfonix. There are also the Cwmbran and District Amateur Radio Society, and Able Radio, who support adults with autism and learning disabilities.

=== Media depictions of Cwmbran ===
In July 2011, Cwmbran was the setting for Goldie Lookin Chain&#x27;s satirical &quot;Fresh Prince of Cwmbran&quot;, a song based on the &quot;Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; theme praising the town.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===

Cwmbran railway station is served by trains on the Welsh Marches Line, with through trains south to Newport and Cardiff. Northbound local trains serve Pontypool and Abergavenny, and longer distance services run to Hereford, Shrewsbury, Wrexham, Crewe, Holyhead and Manchester. The station was not opened until 1986, as one of the last acts of the Cwmbran New Town Development Board.

Until then, Cwmbran had had no train service for 24 years. Historically Cwmbran was served by two lines and several local stations. The first line was built by the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company and opened in 1852. Much of its route is now under Cwmbran Drive, the A4051. The line that is still in use was opened by the Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway in 1874.

=== Bus ===

The town has a comprehensive local bus service from Cwmbran bus station.

Newport Bus operate their 29 &amp; 29A Services from Newport bus station at Friars Walk shopping centre to Cwmbran bus station via Caerleon, Ponthir, Llanfrecha and The Grange University Hospital, With a frequency of 1 bus per hour on both services which in turn has a 30 minute frequency between both services. Stagecoach South Wales operate the majority of services at Cwmbran, including routes from the valleys including Blaenavon, Abergavenny, Pontypool, Blackwood, Varteg, and Hereford, travelling through to the South to Cardiff and Newport.

In early 2019, Stagecoach updated their fleet when they introduced newer model Gold Optare Solo buses for routes 1, 2, 5b/c, 6, 7 and 24. The X24 route to Newport Friars Walk and Blaenavon was upgraded to Stagecoach Gold in 2014. However this has come to an end with the new &#x27;Stagecoach Corporate&#x27; livery taking over as the standard livery for Stagecoach South Wales.

Stagecoach also operates routes 11 to Kemys Fawr &amp; 21 to Blackwood (due to be extended to The Grange University Hospital)

<text>The knowledge economy, or knowledge-based economy, is an economic system in which the production of goods and services is based principally on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to advancement in technical and scientific innovation. The key element of value is the greater dependence on human capital and intellectual property as the source of innovative ideas, information, and practices. Organisations are required to capitalise on this &quot;knowledge&quot; in their production to stimulate and deepen the business development process. There is less reliance on physical input and natural resources. A knowledge-based economy relies on the crucial role of intangible assets within the organisations&#x27; settings in facilitating modern economic growth.

==Overview==

===Description===
A knowledge economy features a highly skilled workforce within the microeconomic and macroeconomic environment; institutions and industries create jobs that demand specialized skills to meet the needs of the global market. Knowledge is viewed as an additional input to labour, and capital. In principle, one&#x27;s primary individual capital is knowledge together with the ability to perform to create economic value.

In a knowledge economy, highly skilled jobs require excellent technical skills and relational skills such as problem-solving, the flexibility to interface with multiple discipline areas as well as the ability to adapt to changes as opposed to moving or crafting physical objects in conventional manufacturing-based economies. A knowledge economy stands in contrast to an agrarian economy, in which the primary economic activity is subsistence farming for which the main requirement is manual labour or an industrialized economy that features mass production in which most of the workers are relatively unskilled.

A knowledge economy emphasizes the importance of skills in a service economy, the third phase of economic development also called a post-industrial economy. It is related to an information economy, which emphasizes the importance of information as non-physical capital, and a digital economy, which emphasizes the degree to which information technology facilitates trade. For companies, intellectual property such as trade secrets, copyrighted material, and patented processes become more valuable in a knowledge economy than in earlier eras.

The global economy&#x27;s transition to a knowledge economy is also referred to as the Information Age, bringing about an information society.
The term &quot;knowledge economy&quot; was made famous by Peter Drucker as the title of Chapter 12 in his book &quot;The Age of Discontinuity&quot; (1969), which Drucker attributed to economist Fritz Machlup, originating in the idea of scientific management developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor.

=== Knowledge-based economy and human capital ===
In a knowledge economy, human intelligence is the key engine of economic development. It is an economy where members acquire, create, disseminate and apply knowledge to facilitate economic and social development. 

An economic system that is not knowledge-based is considered to be inconceivable. It describes the process of consumption and production activities that are satisfied from the application of workers&#x27; expertise - intellectual capital and typically represents a significant level of individual economic activities in modern developed economies through building an interconnected and advanced global economy where sources of knowledge are the critical contributors.

The present concept of &quot;knowledge&quot; originates from the historical and philosophical studies by Gilbert Ryle and Israel Scheffler, who conducted knowledge to the terms &quot;procedural knowledge&quot; and &quot;conceptual Knowledge&quot; and identified two types of skills: &quot;routine competencies or facilities&quot; and &quot;critical skills&quot; that is intelligent performance; and it&#x27;s further elaborated by Lundvall and Johnson who defined &quot;knowledge&quot; as falling in four broad categories:

* &quot;Know-what&quot; refers to knowledge about facts. Like information, experts utilize know-what to fulfill their jobs, such as with complex occupations such as law and medicine.
* &quot;Know-why&quot; refers to scientific knowledge of principles and laws of motion in nature. It concerns the theoretical research of scientific and technological fields, which is essential for allowing innovation in the production process and products development in areas such as universities and specialized firms. It can also reduce error frequency in trial and error procedures.
* &quot;Know-who&quot; refers to knowledge of specific and selective social relations, identifying the key persons who know the solutions and can perform under difficult scenarios. Finding the right people can be more essential to innovation than simply knowing basic scientific knowledge.
* &quot;Know-how&quot; refers to practical skills which allow individuals to do different kinds of things. Individuals share experiences in groups with uniform practices. It constitutes the human capital of enterprises.

The World Bank has spoken of knowledge economies by associating it with a four-pillar framework that analyses the rationales of human capital-based economies:

* &quot;An educated and skilled labour force&quot; is required to establish a strong knowledge-based economy where workers continuously learn and apply their skills to build and practice knowledge efficiently.
* &quot;A dense and modern information infrastructure&quot; provides easy access to information and communication technology (ICT) resources to overcome the barrier of high transaction costs and to facilitate the effectiveness in interacting, disseminating and processing the information and knowledge resources.
* &quot;An effective innovation system&quot; is needed to support a great level of innovation within firms, industries, and countries, allowing them to keep up with the latest global technology and human intelligence to utilize it for the domestic economy.
* &quot;Institutional regime that supports incentives for entrepreneurship and the use of knowledge&quot; suggests that an economic system should offer incentives for better efficiency in mobilizing and allocating resources and encourage entrepreneurship.

The advancement of a knowledge-based economy occurred when global economies promote changes in material production, together with the creation of rich mechanisms of economic theories after the Second World War that tend to integrate science, technology and the economy.

Peter Drucker discussed the knowledge economy in the book &quot;The Effective Executive 1966&quot;, where he described the difference between the manual workers and the knowledge workers. The manual worker is the one who works with their own hands and produces goods and services. In contrast, the knowledge worker works with their head rather than hands and produces ideas, knowledge, and information.

==Information versus knowledge==
Definitions around &quot;knowledge&quot; are considered to be vague in terms of the formalization and modeling of a knowledge economy, as it is rather a relative concept. For example, there is no sufficient evidence and consideration for whether the &quot;information society&quot; could serve or act as the &quot;knowledge society&quot; interchangeably. Information in general, is not equivalent to knowledge. Their use depends on the individual and group&#x27;s preferences which are &quot;economy-dependent&quot;. Information and knowledge together are production resources that can exist without interacting with other sources. Resources are highly independent of each other in the sense that if they connect with other available resources, they transfer into factors of production immediately, and production factors are present only to interact with other factors. Knowledge associated with intellectual information then is said to be a production factor in the new economy that is distinguished from traditional production factors.

==Evolution==
From the early days of economic studies, though economists recognised the essential link between knowledge and economic growth, knowledge was still identified only as a supplemental element in economic factors. The idea behind it has transformed recently when new growth theory praised knowledge and technology in enhancing productivity and economic advancement.

The developed society has transitioned from an agriculture-based economy, that is, the pre-industrial age where economy and wealth were primarily based upon agriculture, to an industrial economy where the manufacturing sector was booming. In the mid-1900s, world economies moved towards a post-industrial or mass production system, where they were driven by the service sector that creates greater wealth versus manufacturing; to the late 1900s - 2000s, knowledge economy emerged with the highlights of the power of knowledge and human capital sector, and it&#x27;s now marked as the latest stage of development in global economic restructuring. In the final decades of 20th century, the knowledge economy became greatly associated with sectors based in research-intensive and high-technology industries as a result of the steadily increased demand for sophisticated science-based innovations. The knowledge economy operates differently from the past as it has been identified by the upheavals (sometimes referred to as the knowledge revolution) in technological innovations and the globally competitive need for differentiation with new goods and services, and processes that develop from the research community (i.e., R&amp;D factors, universities, labs, educational institutes). Thomas A. Stewart points out that just as the Industrial Revolution did not end agriculture because people have to eat, the Knowledge Revolution is unlikely to end manufacturing industries because of ongoing societal demands for physical goods and services.

For the modern knowledge economies, especially in developed countries, information, and knowledge have always taken on enormous importance in the development of either traditional or industrial economies, particularly with the efficient use of factors of production. Owners of production factors should possess and master information and knowledge so as to apply them to economic activity. In the knowledge economy, the specialised labor force is characterised as computer literate and well-trained in handling data, developing algorithms and simulated models, and innovating on processes and systems. Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter asserts that today&#x27;s economy is far more dynamic and that the conventional notion of comparative advantages within a company has changed and is less relevant than the prevailing idea of competitive advantages which rests on &quot;making more productive use of inputs, which requires continual innovation&quot;. Therefore, the technical STEM careers, including computer scientists, engineers, chemists, biologists, mathematicians, and scientific inventors will continue to see demand. Porter further argues that well-situated clusters (that is, geographic concentrations of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field) are vital with global economies, connect locally and globally with linked industries, manufacturers, and other entities that are related by skills, technologies, and other common inputs. Knowledge is the catalyst and connective tissue in modern economies. Ruggles and Holtshouse argue the change is characterised by a dispersion of power and by managers who lead by empowering knowledge workers to contribute and make decisions.

=== Green infrastructure ===
With Earth&#x27;s depleting natural resources, the need for green infrastructure, a logistics industry forced into just-in-time deliveries, growing global demand, regulatory policy governed by performance results, and a host of other items place a high priority on knowledge, and research becomes paramount. Knowledge provides the technical expertise, problem-solving, performance measurement and evaluation, and data management needed for today&#x27;s competition&#x27;s transboundary, interdisciplinary global scale.

=== Prevailing and future economic development ===
Prevailing and future economic development will be highly dominated by technology and network expansion, in particular on knowledge-based social entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship as a whole. The knowledge economy is incorporating the network economy, where the relatively localised knowledge is now being shared among and across various networks for the benefit of all network members, to gain economies of scale in a wider, more open scale.

== Globalisation ==
The rapid globalisation of economic activities is one of the main determinants of the emerging knowledge economy. While there are no doubts on the other stages of relative openness in the global economy, the prevailing pace and intensity of globalisation are without precedent. Fundamental microeconomic forces are the significant drivers of globalizing economic activities and further demands for human intelligence. These forces include the rapid integration of the world&#x27;s financial and capital markets since the early 1980s, which influences essentially each level of the developed country&#x27;s financial and economic systems; increased multinational origin of the inputs to productions of both goods and services, technology transfers and information flow.

== Examples of knowledge economies ==
Worldwide examples congregate around regions or cities with high concentrations of talented human capital and are often accompanied with High tech-oriented companies as well as innovation hubs. The knowledge economic hubs include information technology in Silicon Valley, United States; water and agricultural technology in Silicon Wadi, Israel; aerospace and automotive engineering in Munich, Germany; biotechnology in Hyderabad, India; electronics and digital media in Seoul, South Korea; petrochemical and the renewable energy industry in Brazil. Many other cities and regions try to follow a knowledge-driven development paradigm and increase their knowledge base by investing in higher education and research institutions to attract highly skilled labour and better position themselves in the global competition. Yet, despite digital tools democratising access to knowledge, research shows that knowledge economy activities remain as concentrated as ever in traditional economic cores.

==Technology==
The technology requirements for a national innovation system, as described by the World Bank Institute, must be able to disseminate a unified process by which a working method may converge scientific and technology solutions and organizational solutions. According to the World Bank Institute&#x27;s definition, such innovation would further enable the World Bank Institute&#x27;s vision outlined in its Millennium Development Goals.

===Challenges for developing countries===
The United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development report (UNCSTD, 1997) concluded that for developing countries to integrate ICTs successfully and sustainable development to participate in the knowledge economy, they need to intervene collectively and strategically. Suggested collective intervention includes the development of effective national ICT policies that support the new regulatory framework, promote the selected knowledge production, and use of ICTs and harness their organizational changes to be in line with the Millennium Development Goals. The report further suggests that developing countries develop the required ICT strategies and policies for institutions and regulations, considering the need to be responsive to the issues of convergence.

<text>Farnborough is a town located in the Rushmoor district of Hampshire, England. It has a population of around 57,486 as of the 2011 census and is an important centre of aviation, engineering and technology. The town is probably best known for its association with aviation, including the Farnborough International Airshow, Farnborough Airport, Royal Aircraft Establishment, and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.

==History==

===Pre-history and early settlements===
The earliest evidence of human settlement around Farnborough dates back thousands of years. Archaeologists have uncovered flint tools and other artefacts from the Mesolithic period, indicating the presence of hunter-gatherer communities in the area over 8,000 years ago. During the Neolithic period, the region saw increasing agricultural activity and the development of more permanent settlements. Excavations have revealed the remains of several prehistoric enclosures and barrows within the boundaries of modern-day Farnborough, suggesting it was home to thriving communities in the 4th-2nd millennia BC. The area continued to be inhabited throughout the Bronze Age and Iron Age, with hillforts, field systems and other archaeological evidence indicating the presence of larger, more organized settlements. One notable site is Caesar&#x27;s Camp, an Iron Age hillfort, located just north of the modern town.

The Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD brought major changes to the local landscape. The Devil&#x27;s Highway, a key Roman road, passed through what is now Farnborough, linking the provincial capital of Calleva Atrebatum (modern-day Silchester) with the coastal port of Portus Adurni (Portchester). Numerous Roman artefacts and building remains have been discovered within the town, suggesting it was home to a small rural settlement during the Roman period.

===Saxon Farnborough===
Following the end of Roman rule in the early 5th century, the area was gradually absorbed into the emerging Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The modern name &quot;Farnborough&quot; derives from the Old English &quot;Ferneberga&quot;, meaning &quot;fern-covered hill&quot;.

Farnborough is first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is listed as a small hamlet within the larger manor of Crondall. At this time, the settlement was held by the Norman lord, Odin de Windesores, who owned 3 hides of land there. The Domesday entry suggests Farnborough was a relatively insignificant rural village in the late 11th century, with a population estimated at 50-100 people.

Over the following centuries, Farnborough remained a modest agricultural settlement, its economy based around subsistence farming, woodland management and small-scale industry. The manor passed through the hands of various noble families, including the de Farnborough and de Sherborne dynasties.

===The rise of Farnborough===
Farnborough began to grow and develop more rapidly from the late 18th century onwards, driven by improved transportation links and its proximity to the expanding metropolis of London. The construction of the London and South Western Railway in the 1830s, with a station at Farnborough, greatly enhanced the town&#x27;s accessibility and connectivity. This, combined with its healthy climate and picturesque rural setting, attracted an influx of wealthy London commuters and helped transform Farnborough into more of a suburban residential area.

From 1830 to 1850, Farnborough&#x27;s population grew from around 400 to over 800, as new housing developments and services were established to cater for the expanding middle-class community. The town&#x27;s focal point shifted from the historic village core to the area around the railway station, with the construction of new churches, schools, shops and other amenities.

===The aviation era arrives===
The most transformative event in Farnborough&#x27;s history came in 1905, when the Royal Engineers moved from Aldershot with their Balloon School and factory, to use the open space of Laffan&#x27;s Plain for development and trials. They were joined by Samuel Cody in 1906, who came to demonstrate his man lifting kites, and he persuaded them to let him build an aeroplane. Cody became the first person to fly in a powered aircraft in Great Britain in 1908. A full-scale replica of this Army Aeroplane No 1 now exists in a pavilion alongside the original Balloon School Headquarters building, now home to the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust (FAST) Aviation Museum. With the growth of aircraft related activity, the Army Balloon Factory became the Royal Aircraft Factory under civilian control. In 1912, with the formation of the Royal Flying Corps, the headquarters of the Balloon School became the headquarters of the Royal Flying Corps and is now known as &quot;Trenchard House&quot;. The name of the Royal Aircraft Factory had to be changed in 1918, when the Royal Air Force was formed, becoming the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). This led to Farnborough becoming a globally significant centre for aeronautical research and development.

The establishment of the RAE, and the influx of skilled engineers and technicians it brought, had a profound impact on Farnborough&#x27;s subsequent growth and character. Major aerospace companies such as Supermarine, Handley Page and De Havilland were attracted to set up factories and facilities in the area, further cementing the town&#x27;s reputation as a hub of British aviation.

In the decades following the Second World War, Farnborough continued to expand rapidly, with the development of major new business parks, light industrial estates and residential areas to accommodate the growing population. The town also became renowned globally as the host of the biennial Farnborough International Airshow, one of the world&#x27;s largest and most important aerospace trade events.

==Geography and climate==

===Topography and geology===
Farnborough is located in the northeastern corner of the county of Hampshire, near the border with Surrey. The town occupies a valley setting, with the main urban area situated between the River Blackwater to the east and higher ground to the west. The topography gradually rises from the valley floor, reaching a maximum elevation of around above sea level on the fringes of the town.

Geologically, Farnborough lies on a foundation of London Clay, overlain by deposits of sandy and gravelly Bagshot Beds from the Eocene epoch. The town&#x27;s soils are generally free-draining and infertile, which historically limited the agricultural potential of the land.

===Climate===
Farnborough experiences a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb), typical of southeastern England. Summers are generally warm and dry, with average daily high temperatures around . Winters are mild, with average highs of and lows around .

Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year, with an annual average of around . The driest months are usually spring (April–May) and the wettest are October and November. Snowfall occurs occasionally in winter, but heavy and prolonged snowstorms are uncommon due to the town&#x27;s relatively low elevation and southern latitude.

The Met Office have a weather station at Farnborough Airport which has been operating since 1914.

The table below shows the historical population growth of Farnborough since the early 19th century, based on census data:

===Ethnic composition===
According to the 2011 census, Farnborough&#x27;s ethnic composition was as follows:

White: 87.2%

English is by far the most widely spoken language in Farnborough, with 90.3% of residents reporting it as their main language in the 2011 census. &quot;Other&quot; languages, accounting for 8.1% of the population.

====Religious life====

The Church of England has a significant presence in Farnborough, with several notable places of worship. The oldest is St Peter&#x27;s Church, parts of which date back to the 12th century. The current building was largely reconstructed and expanded during the 19th century, though it retains some original medieval features.

In addition to St Peter&#x27;s, other Anglican churches in Farnborough include St Mark&#x27;s, built in 1881, and the more modern St Martin&#x27;s Church, consecrated in 1978.

The Roman Catholic faith also has a strong presence in Farnborough, centred around St Michael&#x27;s Abbey. This imposing church and monastery complex was constructed in the late 19th century at the behest of the Empress Eugénie, widow of Napoleon III, who lived in the town. St Michael&#x27;s Abbey is home to a community of Benedictine monks and serves as a pilgrimage site, housing the tombs of Napoleon III and the Prince Imperial.

In addition to the Christian denominations, Farnborough is also home to a small Muslim community centred around an Islamic centre established in the late 20th century. There are no purpose-built mosques within the town itself, though proposals for new facilities have been the subject of local controversy and planning disputes over the years.

====Sporting and recreational activities====
Sport plays an important role in the cultural life of Farnborough, with several clubs and facilities serving the local community.

The town&#x27;s rugby union club, Farnborough RFC, was established in 1915 and has long been a fixture of the local sporting scene. The club&#x27;s current home ground is at Tile Barn Close and it fields teams across various levels of the Hampshire leagues.

Farnborough is home to a football club, Farnborough FC, which plays in the National League South. The club has a long and storied history, dating back to the late 19th century, and has occasionally gained national prominence, most notably when they reached the fourth round of the FA Cup in 2003, where they were narrowly defeated by Arsenal at Highbury.

Other sports catered for in the town include cricket, with Cove Cricket Club playing in the Morrant Thames Valley Cricket League, and hockey, where the Camberley and Farnborough Hockey Club represents the local area. There are also tennis clubs, a cycling club, and facilities for various other recreational activities.

====Arts and entertainment====
Farnborough has a varied cultural offering, with a range of arts, entertainment and leisure facilities catering to local residents and visitors.

Farnborough is also home to several museums and heritage attractions that celebrate the town&#x27;s rich aviation history. The Farnborough Air Sciences Trust (FAST) operates a museum dedicated to the legacy of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, with exhibits on the development of British aeronautical technology. Visitors can also explore the historic wind tunnels on the former RAE site, which have been preserved as listed buildings.

==Economy and employment==

===Economic profile and trends===
Farnborough has a relatively prosperous and affluent economic profile compared to many other parts of the UK. Data from the 2011 census shows that the town has a higher than average proportion of residents employed in managerial, professional and technical occupations.

The median annual household income in Farnborough was estimated at £47,000 as of 2020, significantly above the national average. This reflects the town&#x27;s high concentration of well-paid jobs in the aerospace, technology and financial services sectors.

Unemployment rates in Farnborough have historically been low, averaging around 3-4% in recent years, compared to national figures of 4-5%. The town also has a highly skilled workforce, with over 40% of residents holding degree-level qualifications or above.

However, like many town centres across the UK, Farnborough has experienced some challenges in recent years when it comes to the health of its traditional retail sector. The rise of online shopping and changing consumer habits have led to increasing vacancy rates and declining footfall in the town&#x27;s main shopping areas.

In response, Rushmoor Borough Council has developed plans for a major redevelopment of Farnborough&#x27;s town centre. This £100 million+ project, set to be delivered over the coming decade, aims to transform the retail and leisure offer, with the construction of new cinema, restaurant and residential units. The goal is to reposition the town centre as a more vibrant, mixed-use destination that can better adapt to the evolving retail landscape.

===Transport and connectivity===

====Road network====
Farnborough is near arterial routes serving the South of England.

The M3 motorway runs along the northern edge of Farnborough, with junctions 4 and 4a providing access to the town.

The A325 runs north–south through the centre of the town, connecting it to neighbouring Aldershot to the south and Frimley to the north. The A331 Blackwater Valley Relief Road links Farnborough to the wider Blackwater Valley area, including Camberley and Yateley.

Other roads serving Farnborough include the A30, which runs parallel to the M3 and provides an alternative route to London and the west, and the B3411 and B3015 which link the town to surrounding villages and settlements.

====Rail connections====
Farnborough has two railway stations within the town&#x27;s boundaries:

*Farnborough (Main) railway station: This is the busier of the two, situated in the town centre. It is on the South West Main Line between London Waterloo and Basingstoke, providing direct services to the capital as well as regional connections.
*Farnborough North railway station: Located in the northern part of Farnborough, this station is on the North Downs Line linking Reading and Gatwick Airport.

Rail journey times from Farnborough to London Waterloo range from around 35 minutes to 55 minutes, depending on the service. Connections to other major centres like Reading, Guildford and Aldershot are also available, though some routes may require a change of train.

The town&#x27;s rail links have been criticised by some residents and local leaders as being relatively slow and inconvenient compared to other commuter towns in the South East. A 2017 infrastructure assessment commissioned by Rushmoor Borough Council noted that many Farnborough residents choose to drive to faster rail stations like Brookwood, Farnborough (Main) and Sunningdale to access quicker services to London.

====Air transport====
Farnborough has air transport connections centred on Farnborough Airport. It is a business aviation hub, catering primarily to charter flights rather than scheduled commercial passenger services. It hosts the biennial Farnborough International Airshow, one of the world&#x27;s largest aerospace trade events.

It also serves as the home of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the UK&#x27;s specialist air accident investigation authority.

Heathrow Airport, the UK&#x27;s busiest international hub, is around 18 miles to the northeast, while Gatwick Airport is approximately 25 miles to the east. Both can be accessed via the nearby M3 motorway.

====Active travel and public transport====
Farnborough has made efforts in recent years to improve sustainable transport options for residents, with initiatives to promote walking, cycling and public bus services.

A network of cycleways and shared pedestrian/cycle paths has been developed, including a £1.2 million route linking Blackwater station to the Watchmoor business park. Additionally, a new secure bike storage facility was opened in the town centre in 2021 to encourage active travel.

===Sustainability and the environment===
The town was designed as a &quot;Clean Air Zone&quot; in 2021, which introduced stricter emissions standards for vehicles entering the area. This forms part of a broader strategy by Rushmoor Borough Council to improve local air quality and reduce Farnborough&#x27;s carbon footprint.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===
The town&#x27;s primary schools include:
- Cove School
- Fernhill School
- Salesian Catholic Primary School
- St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Primary School

At the secondary level, Farnborough is home to three non-selective, co-educational comprehensive schools:

- Salesian College (boys&#x27; school)

Both of these selective, single-sex institutions offer education up to sixth form level.

===Further and higher education===
Farnborough is home to two prominent further education institutions:

<text>Medieval architecture was the art and science of designing and constructing buildings in the Middle Ages. The major styles of the period included pre-Romanesque, Romanesque, and Gothic. In the fifteenth century, architects began to favour classical forms again, in the Renaissance style, marking the end of the medieval period. Many examples of religious, civic, and military architecture from the Middle Ages survive throughout Europe.

==Styles==
===Pre-Romanesque===


The pre-Romanesque period lasted from the beginning of the Middle Ages (around 500 AD) to the emergence of the Romanesque style (from the 10th century). Much of the notable architecture from the period comes from France and Germany, under the Merovingians and the Carolingians and the Ottonians. Other regions also have examples of architecture from this period, including Croatia, England and Iberia (especially in Asturias and León). In Lombardy, the pre-Romanesque style included many Romanesque features and is therefore known as the First Romanesque.

===Romanesque===
The Romanesque style was predominant across Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries. It is characterized by rounded arches, by barrel or groin vaulting and by thick walls. The first and greatest patrons of Romanesque architecture came from the Church, especially monastic traditions such as Cluniacs and the Cistercians, but examples of Romanesque civic and military buildings survive.

The term &#x27;Romanesque&#x27; (literally meaning &#x27;in the manner of the Romans&#x27;) was first used to describe the style in 1819. Although the style did draw on ancient Roman architecture, it was ultimately an original style and had a wider range of influences than the name suggests.

Examples of Romanesque architecture survive across Europe, including in England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.
===Gothic===

The Gothic style was predominant across Europe between the late 12th century and the end of the Middle Ages in the 15th century. The key feature of Gothic architecture is pointed arches. Other features, including rib vaulting, exterior buttresses, elaborate tracery and stained glass, are commonly found in Gothic architecture. The choir of the Basilica of Saint-Denis in France, completed in 1144, is considered to be the first wholly Gothic building, combining all of these elements.

The term &#x27;Gothic&#x27; (literally meaning &#x27;in the manner of the Goths&#x27;) was first used in the 16th century by Giorgio Vasari. However, the Goths, an ancient Germanic people, had no influence on the Gothic style. The Gothic style actually evolved from Romanesque architecture in France. A number of other factors and styles may have influenced early Gothic architecture. Architecture that combines elements of both the Romanesque and Gothic styles is sometimes referred to as Romano-Gothic.

Scholars have divided Gothic architecture into a number of different periods: Early Gothic in the 12th century, High Gothic (similar to Classic Gothic) in the 13th century, and Late Gothic from the 14th century. During the High Gothic period, Rayonnant was the primary style in France and Decorated was the main style in England. In the Late Gothic period, Flamboyant was the primary style in France (and Spain) and Perpendicular was the main style in England. Although from the 15th century the Gothic style was replaced by Renaissance architecture, marking the end of the Middle Ages and medieval architecture, there were Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival movements in the nineteenth century.

Both religious and secular examples of medieval Gothic architecture survive, notably a number of cathedrals. Examples survive across Europe, including in Belarus, Czechia, England, France, Italy, Lithuania, the Low Countries, Poland, Portugal, Scandinavia, and Spain. Each country developed a unique style of Gothic architecture, as did many smaller regions, including Southern France, Milan, Venice, Catalonia, Levante, and Valencia. The Brick Gothic style was widespread around the Baltic and in North Germany. Towards the end of the Gothic period, a number of new regional styles emerged, often incorporating elements of Renaissance architecture. These include the Plateresque in Spain, Isabelline in Castile, Manueline in Portugal, and Sondergotik around Germany.

==Functions==
===Religious architecture===
Many surviving medieval buildings originally served a religious purpose. The architecture of the buildings depended on the religion it served, the region it was located in, and the styles during the time. For example, mosques often had domes, whereas churches usually had bell towers. Although some examples of medieval synagogues and mosques survive, particularly in Spain, Christian churches and monasteries are the most common survival throughout Europe.

A number of different types of medieval church survive: parish churches, such as in York; cathedral churches; such as across England; and abbey churches, such as across England. Most surviving churches are in the Gothic style, and share a number of features — stained glass, vaulting, buttresses, and an altar at the east end. Churches usually took the shape of a cross, with a nave, chancel, transepts and aisles. Churches often had reliquaries to display precious relics. Their design often had religious symbolism, such as Sunday Christ paintings and biblical narratives in stained glass. The surviving churches are almost entirely made out of stone.

===Military architecture===

Surviving examples of medieval secular architecture mainly served for defense, these include forts, castles, tower houses, and fortified walls. Fortifications were built during the Middle Ages to display the power of the lords of the land and reassure common folk in their protection of property and livelihood. In the early Middle Ages, fortifications were made from wood and earth, these were called Motte and bailey castles. These consist of a stockade or palisade surrounding an enclosed courtyard and man-made mound. This fortification acted as a passive obstacle that potential enemies would have to face to attack the civilization. However, this method of fortification had its downside including being vulnerable to fires so more methods of fortification were created.

Military architecture began to start being created with stone in the 11th century, it was also used to indicate wealth and power of the area protected with it. Stone was much more durable and was fireproof. They also began to adopt the use of cylindrical ground plans. There were many benefits to a cylindrical shape, it reduced blindspots, they were more resistant. Some examples of cylindrical fortifications are the gate towers at Harlech Castle and the Tour des Pénitents.

Medieval Fortifications also displayed many different defensive elements including, hoardings, loopholes or crosslets, and moats. Hoarding and loopholes were both beneficial for the archers or missile throwers, allowing them to see their targets better. Windows gained a cross-shape for more than decorative purposes, they provided a perfect fit for a crossbowman to shoot invaders from inside safely. Moats were used as a defensive mechanism for keeping attackers further away from the fort, while most were kept dry, moats were much more effective when wet.

===Civic architecture===

While much of the surviving medieval architecture is either religious or military, examples of civic and even domestic architecture can be found throughout Europe. Examples include manor houses, town halls, almshouses and bridges, but also residential houses.Walled towns were constructed across Europe, including in Austria.
The Civic landscape of Europe was built up of the crown, the church, guilds, mayors, and the elite. It was also largely running off of ceremonies that connected these relationships. The examples of the civic architecture mentioned in the last paragraph were mostly owned by the elite or government buildings. For example, manor houses were owned by bishops and located closely in relation to churches. These buildings, due to their higher class ownership, were more large in scale with elements that displayed wealth. They also provide an insight into the social history of the area it sits in through its architecture due to them adapting throughout the years to accommodate what the owner needed most. Majority of these buildings were made of stone while some were also wood framed.
