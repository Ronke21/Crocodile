<text>Thames Television, commonly simplified to just Thames, was a franchise holder for a region of the British ITV television network serving London and surrounding areas from 30 July 1968 until the night of 31 December 1992.
Thames Television broadcast from 09:25 Monday morning to 17:15 Friday afternoon (19:00 Friday night until 1982) at which time it would hand over to London Weekend Television (LWT).

Formed as a joint company, it merged the television interests of British Electric Traction (trading as Associated-Rediffusion) owning 49%, and Associated British Picture Corporation—soon taken over by EMI—owning 51%. Like all ITV franchisees at that time, it was a broadcaster, a producer and a commissioner of television programmes, making shows both for the local region it covered and, as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; ITV companies, for networking nationally across the ITV regions. After its loss of franchise in 1992, it continued as an independent production company until 2006.

The British Film Institute describes Thames as having &quot;served the capital and the network with a long-running, broad-based and extensive series of programmes, several of which either continue or are well-remembered today.&quot; Thames covered a broad spectrum of commercial public-service television, with a strong mix of drama, current affairs and comedy.

After Thames was acquired by FremantleMedia it was merged with another Fremantle company, Talkback, to form a new independent production company, Talkback Thames; consequently, Thames ceased to exist as a separate entity, but it, along with Talkback&#x27;s own logo continued to be used separately until 2006, when a new logo for Talkback Thames was introduced. However, on 1 January 2012, the Thames brand was revived and Talkback Thames has now been split into four different labels: Boundless, Retort, Talkback and Thames, within the newly created FremantleMedia UK production arm.

==History==
===Formation===
====Background====
From its formation in 1954, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) offered broadcasting licences to different companies for weekday and weekend service in its first three Independent Television network locations, the London area, the Midlands, and the North. The initial six contracts were parcelled out to different companies. Associated-Rediffusion (Rediffusion) won the London weekday service while Associated Television (ATV) operated weekends. ATV also won the weekday service in the Midlands, while ABC Weekend TV operated the weekend service. Granada Television won daytime service in the North, and ABC the weekends.

Geographical and structural changes to the network led to the first significant shakeups of the network, a process that started in 1967 to take effect from 1968. As part of these changes, the separate weekend service was eliminated in the Midlands and North, who would instead be served by a single seven-day schedule. The London weekday/weekend split schedule remained the same, although the weekend contract was extended to include Friday evenings, but was opened to new applicants.

====ABC loses franchises====
As a result of the changes to the schedule, ABC was at risk of losing both of its existing franchises, the weekend services that would be going away. Consequently, ABC applied for both the Midlands seven-day operation and the contract to serve London at the weekend, preferring the latter.

It was widely expected that the company would be awarded the London weekend franchise. Instead, after an impressive application by a consortium led by David Frost and others, this market was awarded to what became London Weekend Television.

This led to a serious problem for the ITA as ABC was a popular station, whose productions earned vital foreign currency - one such series was &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Its station management and presentation style were also well-admired.

While they were still in the running for the seven-day service in the Midlands, it was clear this would be won by ATV, who was also a large earner of overseas revenue, having won the Queen&#x27;s Award for Export in 1966.

====Rediffusion angers the ITA====
In programming, Rediffusion was originally considered stuffy but in the previous contract round of 1964, it had re-invented itself, dropping the name Associated-Rediffusion in favour of the trendier Rediffusion London, to reflect the cultural changes of the time, with its output altered accordingly.

By the time of the 1967 negotiations, Rediffusion believed that its contract renewal for London weekday service was a formality, and its application reflected this complacency: the company had treated the ITA high-handedly in interviews.

In the early days of ITV, the company had worked hard to keep the network on-air during financial crises that threatened the collapse of other companies, particularly Granada. It was reported that Rediffusion&#x27;s chairman Sir John Spencer Wills felt the ITA owed his company a &#x27;debt of gratitude&#x27; for this, a comment which particularly annoyed the authority.

During the interview process, several members of Rediffusion management also appeared in interviews for applicants for other regions, principally the consortium of which David Frost was a member, as well as the interview for Rediffusion, leading the ITA to question the loyalty at the company.

====ABC and Rediffusion become Thames====
The outcome proposed by the ITA was a &quot;shotgun marriage&quot; between ABC and Rediffusion. &quot;The combination of these two companies,&quot; announced ITA Chairman Lord Hill, &quot;seemed to the Authority to offer the possibility of a programme company of real excellence.&quot; The resultant company was awarded the contract to serve London on weekdays.

Control of the new company would be given to ABC, a move unpopular with Rediffusion. Questioning the ITA&#x27;s decision, Rediffusion attempted to slow down the merger: only the threat of giving the licence solely to ABC made it relent. To assist Rediffusion financially, the ITA insisted that the new company have two sets of shares: voting shares which would allow ABC to have control (with 51%) and &#x27;B&#x27; shares which were to be split equally between the two, thus sharing profits fairly.

The structure of the new company was also a problem. A merger between the two existing contract holders ABC Television Limited and Rediffusion Television Limited was impossible, owing to internal politics, as was a merger between their respective parent companies Associated British Picture Corporation and British Electric Traction. The answer was found to be a new holding company, Thames Television (Holdings) Ltd. ABC&#x27;s parent, the Associated British Picture Corporation was taken over by EMI in 1969, and in 1979 became part of Thorn EMI.

The ITA ordered ABC&#x27;s managing director Howard Thomas and its director of programmes Brian Tesler to be appointed in similar capacities at the new station, the only individuals named or specified in all 15 franchise awards. ABC had majority control of the new company and the make-up of its board predominantly (and eventually fully) came from ABC. The use of ABC&#x27;s old studios at Teddington meant the workforce was predominantly ex-ABC, although those at Kingsway were ex-Rediffusion.

After some discussion as to the name of the new company—some directors favoured ABC London, while others suggested Tower Television to reflect the Post Office Tower and the Tower of London—it was named Thames Television, after the River Thames. This name had been previously considered and rejected by London Weekend Television.

On 30 July 1968, Thames began broadcasting to London. The opening week was disrupted by sporadic strike action; the following week, the action had spread to all of ITV and resulted in the creation of a management-run ITV Emergency National Service for some two weeks.

Each week Thames broadcast from the start of transmissions on Monday until its handover to London Weekend Television at 19:00 on Friday. (From 1982, the handover time was 17:15.)

===Studios===
The former ABC studios at Teddington became Thames&#x27;s main production base. Thames&#x27;s corporate base moved to its newly constructed studios and offices on Euston Road (next to Euston Tower) in 1970, when it relinquished Television House, Rediffusion&#x27;s former London headquarters. The Teddington studios were highly desirable, as they had participated in colour experiments and were already partially converted by the time of the franchise change, and as such had been sought after by both Thames and LWT.

When Thames was formed, the new company acquired numerous other properties of the former franchise holders. Rediffusion&#x27;s main studio complex at Wembley was leased to London Weekend Television by order of the ITA before being sold to Lee International in 1977. ABC&#x27;s Midlands base in Aston, Birmingham (see Alpha Television), co-owned with ATV, was sold in 1971 when ATV moved to new colour television facilities. Its northern base in Didsbury, Manchester, was used by Yorkshire Television prior to its Kirkstall Road studios in Leeds being completed, and eventually sold to Manchester Polytechnic in 1970, with a lease on sales offices in central Manchester being surrendered.

===Early programmes===

The station continued formats inherited from its predecessors. These included the variety show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, the last series of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and the detective thrillers &quot;Callan&quot; and &quot;Public Eye&quot;, all inherited from ABC. The comedy &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot;, though, originated with Rediffusion, and if nominally a children&#x27;s show, was one of the forerunners of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

More conventional sitcoms, all of which began in Thames&#x27;s early years, included &quot;Father, Dear Father&quot; (1968–73), the Sid James vehicle &quot;Bless This House&quot; (1971–76), and &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; (1972-76), with a controversial take on race relations. Another sitcom, &quot;Man About the House&quot; (1973–76), was successful enough for two spin-offs, &quot;George and Mildred&quot; (1976–80) and &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1977-81).

The company took over the &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; format in 1969, several years after the BBC had dropped the show in 1964. Another BBC favourite was comedian Benny Hill, the star of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; (1969–89), who was placed under contract. Hill spent most of the rest of his career with Thames.

&quot;The Sooty Show&quot;, cancelled in 1967 by the BBC, now aired on Thames and began on the first day of transmission. It continued after Harry Corbett&#x27;s retirement in 1975 with his son, Matthew Corbett, and lasted on Thames until late 1992. The company also produced the children&#x27;s show &quot;Magpie&quot; (1968–80), intended as a rival for &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on BBC1, and &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; (1973–79), a science fiction series commissioned as an answer to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

For preschool children there was &quot;Rainbow&quot;, which started in 1972 and ran for 20 years. The programme used animation and graphics created by Stop Frame Productions, which later became Cosgrove Hall, a Thames subsidiary founded in 1976 which made animated series for children. During the hours after &quot;Rainbow&quot; and before the children&#x27;s slot, &quot;Good Afternoon&quot; was transmitted, a magazine programme. It began after the IBA allowed non-schools broadcasting in this period of the day, when the government relaxed the regulations around daytime television and featured interview editions undertaken by such broadcasters as Mavis Nicholson, and a weekly consumer programme, which eventually became a programme in its own right; &quot;Money-Go-Round&quot;.

Thames also produced &quot;The World at War&quot; (1973–74), a 26-part history of the Second World War using unseen footage and interviews, often of high-level participants. The series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, was commissioned in 1969, took four years to produce, and cost a record £4m (approx £47m in 2018).

Thames gained a reputation for drama with such series as &quot;Jenny, Lady Randolph Churchill&quot; (1974), with Lee Remick as the mother of Winston Churchill. It won an Emmy as the best series in its category, as &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot; (1978), about the abdication crisis, did later. Other successful series in the genre from this period include &quot;Shades of Greene&quot; (1975–76), &quot;Rock Follies&quot; (1976), and &quot;Armchair Thriller&quot; (1978–80). These programmes were made in the then standard &#x27;hybrid&#x27; studio video/location film format, but the British industry was in the slow process of dropping the multi-camera studio format for drama, excepting soaps, to making the genre entirely on film.

The Thames offshoot Euston Films was founded in 1971 to specialise in drama output made entirely on film, then still a rare practice. Euston made the police series &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975–78), &quot;Danger UXB&quot; (1979), and &quot;Minder&quot; (1979–94), plus the last appearance of Nigel Kneale&#x27;s best known creation in &quot;Quatermass&quot; (1979). In this era, Euston also made single one-off dramas such as &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot; (1975).

On 1 December 1976, the punk band the Sex Pistols were interviewed live on Thames&#x27;s regional news magazine programme, &quot;Today&quot;. Members of the group uttered obscenities during their interview with Bill Grundy. Grundy, in his introduction, said they are &quot;as drunk as I am&quot;, but later claimed his comment was a joke, and had allowed the bad language to illustrate the character of the individuals in the group. The interview filled two minutes at the end of the programme, but the production team feared trouble in the studio if they stopped the programme mid-air. Thames&#x27;s telephone switchboard was jammed by complaining viewers. Responding to the incident, Thames said in a statement: &quot;Because the programme was live, it was impossible to foresee the language that would be used.&quot; The press continued to be interested in the incident for several days. Grundy was suspended and &quot;Today&quot; ended soon afterwards; his career never recovered. Over time, Thames replaced &quot;Today&quot; with a more conventional news offering as seen on other ITV stations. &quot;Thames at Six&quot; was launched, later &quot;Thames News&quot;.

In 1978, Thames secured a contract with Morecambe &amp; Wise. The comedians had worked for the BBC since 1968 with major national success, but the decisive factor leading the duo to leave the corporation was Thames&#x27;s offer to feature them as main leads in a film made by the company&#x27;s Euston Films subsidiary. The comedy duo&#x27;s leading scriptwriter, Eddie Braben, did not initially move to ITV with them, and with Eric Morecambe&#x27;s failing health, the new shows never gained the audiences or matched the esteem they had previously enjoyed.

One of the early anchor presenters was radio DJ Tom Edwards.

===Industrial relations up to the end of 1979===
Like most of ITV, Thames was beset by conflicts with trade unions, notably the Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians (ACTT). A two-week technicians strike in the summer of 1975 shut down the whole of ITV with the technicians being bought off with a 35% pay rise.

Two years later in May 1977, another strike occurred when production assistants at Thames refused to operate new video equipment. Thames proceeded to sack all the technicians for breach of contract. The following month, both sides backed down over the issues, with all technicians returning to work.

The worst strike to hit the network originated at Thames. Failure to reach agreement on pay increases and shift allowances in the 1979 pay round resulted in technicians switching off power to the transmission facilities at the Euston Road centre on 6 August. After management restored power, the technicians walked out. Within four days, all but one ITV station had gone off-air after the ACTT asked members at other companies to walk out in claim for a 15% pay rise. The network was off the air for 10 weeks.

===Later programming===
Other Thames shows included &quot;This Week&quot; (known as &quot;TV Eye&quot; between 1979 and 1985), &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, the game shows &quot;Strike It Lucky&quot;, &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; and &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, and the drama &quot;Dodger, Bonzo and the Rest&quot;.

Thames sitcoms during the 1980s and early 1990s included &quot;Keep it in the Family&quot;, &quot;Never the Twain&quot;, &quot;After Henry&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;. The Mr. Bean pilot episode, starring Rowan Atkinson as the titular character, was first broadcast on ITV on 1 January 1990, and the eventual run lasted beyond Thames holding of its franchise. Less well-known is its adaptation of &quot;Andy Capp&quot; (1988), starring James Bolam. Two of its post-franchise sitcoms found more success when they transferred away from ITV – &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;, which moved to the BBC in 1994 and &quot;Is It Legal?&quot;, which moved to Channel 4 in 1998. Both were written by Simon Nye and co-produced by independent company Hartswood Films.

A few years after &quot;The World at War&quot;, Thames broadcast &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980), a 13-part documentary series about the era of the America silent cinema. This series, produced by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, was followed by the company sponsoring Thames Silents, a project undertaken by Brownlow and Gill of the restoration and screenings (in a limited number of cinemas and on television) of major films from the silent era. The two men followed &quot;Hollywood&quot; with series dedicated to leading comics of the silent era, &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot; (1983) and &quot;Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow&quot; (1987). A programme on Harold Lloyd (&quot;The Third Genius&quot;) followed in 1989. &quot;Hollywood&quot; and the Chaplin series were narrated by the actor James Mason.

Unusually for a commercial broadcaster, Thames also produced lavish versions of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Thames&#x27;s subsidiary production company Euston Films continued to produce many of Thames&#x27;s highest-profile drama contributions to ITV network programming to the end of its ITV franchise. These included &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot; (1983), &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (1988), &quot;Capital City&quot; (1989–1990), &quot;Selling Hitler&quot; (1991), and &quot;Anglo-Saxon Attitudes&quot; (1992).

&quot;The Bill&quot; (1984–2010) began as a one-hour series of separate stories in 1984, but from 1989 until 1998 was broadcast several times a week, usually in a 30 minute slot. Its storylines became overly melodramatic and focussed far more directly on particular police characters rather than the crime from 1998 and its return to the hour long slot and then became much more a soap opera in 2002 (when individual story titles were dropped) until coming full circle dealing predominantly with crime again in about 2007 for the last few years of its existence.

===Programming controversies===
In January 1985, the company made a deal with international distributors for US production company Lorimar to purchase the UK broadcasting rights for US drama &quot;Dallas&quot;, at that time transmitted on BBC1. This broke a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement between the two sides not to poach each other&#x27;s imported shows. Thames paid £55,000 a show compared to the £29,000 of the BBC. The deal brought condemnation from the BBC and from other ITV stations, who feared the BBC would poach their imports, pushing up prices.

The BBC planned to delay transmission of the episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot; that it already had, with the hope to broadcast them at the same time Thames broadcast its new purchases. Ultimately, pressure from several ITV companies (especially Yorkshire Television) to the IBA, forced Thames to sell the series back to the BBC at a loss. Bryan Cowgill, the managing director of Thames left the company, as he believed his position was untenable since the board was unwilling to support his plans to buy the series. In October, Thames paid the BBC, via the IBA, £300,000 in compensation to make up the shortfall in additional cost for new episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot;.

The most controversial programme Thames broadcast was the documentary &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;, part of the current affairs &quot;This Week&quot; series. The programme questioned the authority of British troops who had shot dead suspected IRA members allegedly planning a terrorist attack on a British military ceremony in Gibraltar. The documentary was regarded almost as treason by many Conservative politicians, and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; made claims about one of the witnesses interviewed which were later found to be libellous.

The following year, in 1989, Thames ended the contract of Benny Hill, a stalwart at the station since 1969. It was believed that the comedian was dismissed because his shows were considered offensive and politically incorrect, but John Howard Davies said the decision was taken because of falling ratings, very high production costs and Hill was looking tired. The show at its peak had 21 million viewers, while the last episode had nine million.

===Industrial relations in the Thatcher era===
Through the early 1980s, Thames experienced a series of local disputes while management deliberately confronted contractual ‘rackets’, and pursued the introduction of new technologies based on operational requirements rather than precedent. For Thames’s management, this was a materialist operation with a clear dimension, and to weed out unscrupulous bargaining and working practices.

In the summer of 1984 a major strike was called, this time, over Thames&#x27;s management unilaterally issuing new rostering schedules (overtime payments for transmission staff), and the use of new cameras and editing equipment. There were no internal discussions of the potential savings that could be derived from new shift patterns, but there was a strong sense that union controls had to be removed before the company embarked on increasing its operations. The technicians walked for a few hours on Monday 30 July, but the station was able to return just one day as management and administration staff took over their roles.

On Monday 27 August, ACTT technicians walked out again over the new shift patterns; the strike ended on 3 September 1984, at 1p.m. after the union agreed to rostering according to need, while the management dropped plans for ending six-day working fortnights. Bryan Cowgill said: &quot;The need for sensible change in the way we conduct our operations has been at the heart of this dispute. The outcome of a damaging and costly dispute has resulted in substantial progress towards a more realistic and effective way of working&quot;.

Over the following four weeks, further discussions took place about implementing the plans while introducing new technologies. On Wednesday 17 October, another strike was instigated, as talks failed to reach agreement. The union warned against a management-run service, as it would be a recipe for total network disturbance and a massive loss of programmes, but Thames claimed that it would be justified due to the strike being unofficial. On Monday 22 October, a management-run service started operating; the company claimed the revised schedule was popular with the viewers.

During the period of the management operated emergency schedule, viewers in the Thames Television region would see the ITV breakfast service TV-am from 6.25am until 9.25am. Once TV-am concluded, when the rest of the UK received schools programmes, Thames viewers were left with a blue screen showing their upcoming emergency schedule which would normally start at around 1.30pm and conclude around midnight. With no access to ITN News, viewers in the Thames region had to make do with short Thames News bulletins. Weekend ITV schedules for the London region were not affected by the strike, with London Weekend Television coming on air on Fridays at 5.15pm as usual.

The strike ended on 3 November 1984, after 62 film editors agreed to the new conditions, while the ACTT agreed as well to start negotiations about the introductions of new technology. Additional episodes of network productions were screened to help clear the backlog, since no outside programmes were broadcast. Thames said: &quot;We are delighted in the outcome of the dispute which we believe is in the best interests of everyone who works at Thames&quot;.

For the Thames board, the dispute represented a huge, but necessary, cost if the company was to expand its production operations profitably. Profits at Thames dropped – from £14.1 million in 1983/84 to £8.75 million in 1984/85 – during the strike period, but were able to recover back to £14.6 million in 1985/86 just before flotation on the stock market.

During April 1988, after successfully introducing new technologies and employing more freelance staff, Thames announced the loss of 200 jobs from its permanent workforce, which followed similar action from other ITV companies in a bid to slim down their workforce and alter working practices for economic reasons. Thames made a further 297 employees redundant as part of its restructuring plan to reduce its staff to 1,500 in preparation for the 1991 ITV franchise round.

===Area and ownership changes===
In 1982, the Independent Broadcasting Authority decided to change the Thames franchise area, which resulted in the Bluebell Hill transmitter in north Kent, its associated relays and the main relay at Tunbridge Wells being transferred from London to the new &quot;South and South-East of England&quot;, TVS franchise, in order to serve the new region better.

In 1985, Carlton Communications had executed a failed take-over bid for Thames after Thorn EMI and British Electric Traction decided to sell their share of Thames. The deal was blocked by both Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames, and by the IBA, which concluded &#x27;the proposal would lead to a major change in the nature and characteristic of a viable ITV programme company&#x27;.

Carlton&#x27;s owner, Michael Green, claimed that the decision left him &#x27;bewildered&#x27; and said: &#x27;We are surprised at the IBA&#x27;s decision. I&#x27;m absolutely certain it would not have been a major change to Thames. We have always suggested that we would make absolutely sure the company would continue to be what it is at this moment in time.&#x27; The IBA said it had nothing against Carlton owning part of an ITV company, but believed &#x27;any&#x27; single ownership of an ITV company was undesirable.

It has been said that Carlton chief executive Michael Green talked to the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the matter, which in turn may have helped to shape the Broadcasting Act 1990, which replaced the IBA with the Independent Television Commission and the change in franchise allocation procedures.

Thames finally floated on the stock market in July 1986, after being blocked by the IBA in late 1982. The shares on offer were being sold by BET and Thorn EMI, which planned to reduce their shareholding from 100% down to 28.8%. A few days afterwards speculation appeared that Carlton had attempted to buy a sizable number of shares; Michael Green, chairman of Carlton, was quoted saying &quot;I can&#x27;t possibly comment&quot; but a Thames spokesperson pointed out &quot;It does seem quite likely, however, no one share holder can own more than 10% of our equity so it&#x27;s difficult to see what they might have in mind&quot;.

During 1989 reports appeared that talks were taking place with Carlton about an agreed merger, which resulted in no action. The flotation was not a great success, EMI and BET only managing to reduce their shares to 56.6%, with management acquiring much of the new stock. In March 1990, EMI and BET tried once again to sell off their shares in Thames, with Carlton and CLT (a Luxembourg-based media company) both in the running.

However, by October talks had stalled, with EMI and BET still controlling Thames before heading into the 1991 franchise round.

===Franchise loss===
On 16 October 1991, it was announced that Thames Television would lose its weekday London ITV franchise from the beginning of January 1993 as a result of losing the silent auction used to award the new licences. Thames bid £32.5 million while Carlton Television placed a bid of £43.2 million, and, since both Thames and Carlton were deemed to have passed the quality threshold, the licence was awarded to Carlton for having submitted the higher cash bid; the highest bidder in the auction, CPV-TV, was deemed to have failed on quality grounds. Some commentators consequently speculated that Thames had fallen victim to a &#x27;government vendetta&#x27;, whilst others felt that the auction had been won fairly. Carlton chose to commission the vast majority of its production content from third parties, and rent studio and broadcasting space at LWT&#x27;s London Studios.

Thames was bullish after losing, since the company had made confidential contingency plans, which involved 1,000 redundancies and the closure of the Euston Road facility. The company believed it would become &quot;Europe&#x27;s most powerful independent producer and programme distributor.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; quoted a spokesman the day after the announcement: &quot;We can be more profitable this way, being forced out of broadcasting will save us £32.5m a year in bid payments, £30 million a year in advertising revenue taxes and about £10m in transmitter cost.&quot;

The transition of ITV companies was never smooth, but Thames&#x27;s bitterness stayed until the very end. In June 1992 Carlton and the ITV network centre had backed down over its demands for Thames to relinquish its right to broadcast repeats of its own programmes on rival channels for 10 years. Thames believed Carlton&#x27;s demands were unreasonable and would have forced it to drop most networked programmes on ITV during the autumn of 1992.

Thames chairman Richard Dunn publicly stated that Carlton chairman Michael Green had done everything in his power to obtain the London weekday franchise since being blocked by the IBA in 1985. Prior to its launch, Carlton was forced to advertise on LWT to promote its new programme line up, following an acrimonious High Court dispute between Thames and Carlton over the selling of rights of hundreds of films in Thames&#x27;s library. Carlton settled out of court for £13.1 million.

The loss of Thames&#x27;s franchise was seen as controversial by many, and highly significant by most, given Thames&#x27;s history within ITV, as a long-standing franchisee in its own right, its heritage from the start of the network through its founding parents ABC and Rediffusion London, and the fact that it was one of the major contributors of content to the ITV network. The auction method used to conduct the new franchise round was a significant change from previous rounds and was brought about by the Broadcasting Act 1990. Consequently, the franchise loss became a subject of political debate, with changes brought about by the 1990 act being cited as &#x27;The primary reason for an operation such as Thames being able to lose its licence to broadcast&#x27;. That the then Conservative government had passed such an act caused accusations of direct responsibility to be levelled at former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in particular, who had presided over its creation.

Opinions varied on the matter of political motivations; some cite the documentary &quot;Death On The Rock&quot;, which may have caused displeasure to the then government, whilst others link it to a more general ideological dislike of the way ITV had been run at the time, with over-manning, and the fact that programme production was generally limited to franchise holders (sometimes critically referred to as barriers to entry), being seen as examples of why more commercial freedom and competition was needed within the network.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Branding and presentation==
The first idents to be used comprised a plain screen with the words &#x27;from Thames&#x27; written in white in the Helvetica font, and a vignette that resembled the famous ident, containing famous London landmarks. The first ident was used to signify programmes made at Rediffusion&#x27;s old studios at Adastral House, the latter, shows that came from ABC&#x27;s former Teddington Studios. Some programmes recorded at Teddington, such as some episodes of the 1969 series of &quot;Callan&quot; did, however, use the &quot;from Thames&quot; caption, indicating that they may have been edited at Adastral House rather than Teddington. Both of the company&#x27;s logos were accompanied by a fanfare called &quot;Salute to Thames&quot;, composed by Johnny Hawksworth.

With the introduction of colour, the ident was remodelled on the vignette, this time using photographs rather than drawings. This ident was designed by agency Minale Tattersfield. It was originally shot by stop-frame animation on 16 mm film, then shot again on 35 mm film in 1976 and finally digitised on computer in 1984. All of these animations featured the same design, which consisted of the skyline slowly rolling up from the River Thames along with the logo, which was reflected briefly on the water and then quickly faded to its static position at the centre of the ident.

The ident was finally withdrawn in July 1989, when Thames celebrated its 21st anniversary. The revised ident retained the London landmarks but contained them in a blue and orange triangle, pointing downwards, with three wavy blue lines to represent the river and the words &#x27;Thames XXI&#x27; in the orange part of the triangle and it was this logo which was used on the first ITV branding idents on 4 September 1989.

A new ident was launched on 3 September 1990, featuring a redesigned triangle logo containing Big Ben, the British Telecom Tower, the dome of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the Tower Bridge. Initially, this ident, featuring a new station theme composed by Anthony and Gaynor Sadler, was used only before local programmes; a modified ITV generic ident featuring this new logo was used for networked shows. Once Thames learned it was to lose its franchise to Carlton, the ITV-branded ident was dropped in favour of the local ident which was used throughout during most broadcast hours (except for overnights) from 4 November 1991 until 31 December 1992.

==From 1992==
Thames Television was involved in an attempt to win the new Channel 5 licence when it was first advertised in early 1992. Thames was the main shareholder in a consortium (alongside Warner Bros. Television and others) called Channel Five Holdings. The consortium became the only bidder for the licence in December 1992 after two other groups dropped out. However the ITC rejected the bid as a result of concerns about its business plan and investor backing. The deadline was therefore extended twice before the licence was handed to Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited.

On 1 November 1992 a new satellite station UK Gold was launched as a joint venture between Thames and BBC Enterprises, to show repeats of shows from both broadcasters. Thames&#x27;s share was bought out by Flextech in 1996.

After its loss of ITV franchise on 31 December 1992, Thames continued as an independent production company for another ten years. &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; ran on ITV for 26 years until around 1995 when ITV cancelled it and the series was recommissioned by the BBC, with Thames continuing to produce it. The corporation ended the series in 2003. &quot;The Bill&quot; continued on ITV until 2010.

Following the loss of Thames&#x27;s franchise, the Euston Road base of Thames was sold off and demolished. The site of the studios is currently occupied by Triton Square and the registered headquarters of the British operation of Spanish bank Santander. The studios at Teddington were sold to a management buy-out team and were part of the Pinewood Group, owners of both Pinewood and Shepperton Studios.
Thames Television was acquired by Pearson Television on 23 April 1993. Pearson Television was itself sold by Pearson plc to CLT-UFA in 2000, thus merging to become the RTL Group, and rebranded as FremantleMedia in 2001. In 2003, Thames Television was merged with another FremantleMedia subsidiary, Talkback (founded by comedians Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones in 1981) to form Talkback Thames. Despite the merger, the Thames logo continued to be used at the end of the label&#x27;s entertainment productions until 2006. That subsidiary was split into four new production companies at the start of 2012, with the new Thames producing light entertainment programming until the start of 2025, when the re-merging of it and Talkback to form Talkback Thames.

==Culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Thames is often quoted as a prime example of a commercial public-service broadcaster with shows covering all aspects of the spectrum and the largest producer in the network. Its shows achieved massive audiences and are still remembered many years later. This is sometimes attributed to the culture of the company, which could be claimed to be a continuation of that at ABC. That station was more highly regarded by the ITA (amongst others) than Rediffusion whose programming was seen as downmarket and whose management-style was viewed as high-handed. The two companies allowed Thames independence (although in later years there were accusations that they both treated the company as a cash cow).

The children&#x27;s department also spawned the independent production company Tetra Films, which would later revive some classic Thames children&#x27;s programmes for ITV – &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; (1992–5, in association with Thames-owned Reeves Entertainment for ITV and Nickelodeon) and &quot;Rainbow&quot; (1994–96, for HTV) – along with a range of original film and television productions.

<text>Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI) measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases.

The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990. This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells. Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not involve the use of injections, surgery, the ingestion of substances, or exposure to ionizing radiation. This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied. The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling and diffusion MRI. Diffusion MRI is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain.

In addition to detecting BOLD responses from activity due to tasks or stimuli, fMRI can measure resting state, or negative-task state, which shows the subjects&#x27; baseline BOLD variance. Since about 1998 studies have shown the existence and properties of the default mode network, a functionally connected neural network of apparent &quot;resting brain states&quot;.

fMRI is used in research, and to a lesser extent, in clinical work. It can complement other measures of brain physiology such as electroencephalography (EEG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Newer methods which improve both spatial and time resolution are being researched, and these largely use biomarkers other than the BOLD signal. Some companies have developed commercial products such as lie detectors based on fMRI techniques, but the research is not believed to be developed enough for widespread commercial use.

==Overview==
The fMRI concept builds on the earlier MRI scanning technology and the discovery of properties of oxygen-rich blood. MRI brain scans use a strong, permanent, static magnetic field - expressed in Tesla (T) - to align nuclei in the brain region being studied. Another magnetic field, the gradient field, is then applied to spatially locate different nuclei. Finally, a radiofrequency (RF) pulse is played to kick the nuclei to higher magnetization levels, with the effect now depending on where they are located. When the RF field is removed, the nuclei go back to their original states, and the energy they emit is measured with a coil to recreate the positions of the nuclei. MRI thus provides a static structural view of brain matter. The central thrust behind fMRI was to extend MRI to capture functional changes in the brain caused by neuronal activity. Differences in magnetic properties between arterial (oxygen-rich) and venous (oxygen-poor) blood provided this link.

Since the 1890s, it has been known that changes in blood flow and blood oxygenation in the brain (collectively known as brain hemodynamics) are closely linked to neural activity. When neurons become active, local blood flow to those brain regions increases, and oxygen-rich (oxygenated) blood displaces oxygen-depleted (deoxygenated) blood around 2 seconds later. This rises to a peak over 4–6 seconds, before falling back to the original level (and typically undershooting slightly). Oxygen is carried by the hemoglobin molecule in red blood cells. Deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) is more magnetic (paramagnetic) than oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), which is virtually resistant to magnetism (diamagnetic). This difference leads to an improved MR signal since the diamagnetic blood interferes with the magnetic MR signal less. This improvement can be mapped to show which neurons are active at a time.

===History===

During the late 19th century, Angelo Mosso invented the &#x27;human circulation balance&#x27;, which could non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity. However, although briefly mentioned by William James in 1890, the details and precise workings of this balance and the experiments Mosso performed with it remained largely unknown until the recent discovery of the original instrument as well as Mosso&#x27;s reports by Stefano Sandrone and colleagues. Angelo Mosso investigated several critical variables that are still relevant in modern neuroimaging such as the &#x27;signal-to-noise ratio&#x27;, the appropriate choice of the experimental paradigm and the need for the simultaneous recording of differing physiological parameters. Mosso&#x27;s manuscripts do not provide direct evidence that the balance was really able to measure changes in cerebral blood flow due to cognition, however a modern replication performed by David T Field has now demonstrated—using modern signal processing techniques unavailable to Mosso—that a balance apparatus of this type is able to detect changes in cerebral blood volume related to cognition.

In 1890, Charles Roy and Charles Sherrington first experimentally linked brain function to its blood flow, at Cambridge University. The next step to resolving how to measure blood flow to the brain was Linus Pauling&#x27;s and Charles Coryell&#x27;s discovery in 1936 that oxygen-rich blood with Hb was weakly repelled by magnetic fields, while oxygen-depleted blood with dHb was attracted to a magnetic field, though less so than ferromagnetic elements such as iron. Seiji Ogawa at AT&amp;T Bell labs recognized that this could be used to augment MRI, which could study just the static structure of the brain, since the differing magnetic properties of dHb and Hb caused by blood flow to activated brain regions would cause measurable changes in the MRI signal. BOLD is the MRI contrast of dHb, discovered in 1990 by Ogawa. In a seminal 1990 study based on earlier work by Thulborn et al., Ogawa and colleagues scanned rodents in a strong magnetic field (7.0 T) MRI. To manipulate blood oxygen level, they changed the proportion of oxygen the animals breathed. As this proportion fell, a map of blood flow in the brain was seen in the MRI. They verified this by placing test tubes with oxygenated or deoxygenated blood and creating separate images. They also showed that gradient-echo images, which depend on a form of loss of magnetization called T2* decay, produced the best images. To show these blood flow changes were related to functional brain activity, they changed the composition of the air breathed by rats, and scanned them while monitoring brain activity with EEG. The first attempt to detect the regional brain activity using MRI was performed by Belliveau and colleagues at Harvard University using the contrast agent Magnevist, a paramagnetic substance remaining in the bloodstream after intravenous injection. However, this method is not popular in human fMRI, because of the inconvenience of the contrast agent injection, and because the agent stays in the blood only for a short time.

Three studies in 1992 were the first to explore using the BOLD contrast in humans. Kenneth Kwong and colleagues, using both gradient-echo and inversion recovery echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T published studies showing clear activation of the human visual cortex. The Harvard team thereby showed that both blood flow and blood volume increased locally in activity neural tissue. Ogawa and Ugurbil conducted a similar study using a higher magnetic field (4.0 T) in Ugurbil&#x27;s laboratory at the University of Minnesota, generating higher resolution images that showed activity largely following the gray matter of the brain, as would be expected; in addition, they showed that fMRI signal depended on a decrease in T2*, consistent with the BOLD mechanism. T2* decay is caused by magnetized nuclei in a volume of space losing magnetic coherence (transverse magnetization) from both bumping into one another and from experiencing differences in the magnetic field strength across locations (field inhomogeneity from a spatial gradient). Bandettini and colleagues used EPI at 1.5 T to show activation in the primary motor cortex, a brain area at the last stage of the circuitry controlling voluntary movements. The magnetic fields, pulse sequences and procedures and techniques used by these early studies are still used in current-day fMRI studies. But today researchers typically collect data from more slices (using stronger magnetic gradients), and preprocess and analyze data using statistical techniques.

===Physiology===
The brain does not store a lot of glucose, its primary source of energy. When neurons become active, getting them back to their original state of polarization requires actively pumping ions across the neuronal cell membranes, in both directions. The energy for those ion pumps is mainly produced from glucose. More blood flows in to transport more glucose, also bringing in more oxygen in the form of oxygenated hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. This is from both a higher rate of blood flow and an expansion of blood vessels. The blood-flow change is localized to within 2 or 3 mm of where the neural activity is. Usually the brought-in oxygen is more than the oxygen consumed in burning glucose (it is not yet settled whether most glucose consumption is oxidative), and this causes a net decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) in that brain area&#x27;s blood vessels. This changes the magnetic property of the blood, making it interfere less with the magnetization and its eventual decay induced by the MRI process.

The cerebral blood flow (CBF) corresponds to the consumed glucose differently in different brain regions. Initial results show there is more inflow than consumption of glucose in regions such as the amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus and cingulate cortex, all of which are recruited for fast responses. In regions that are more deliberative, such as the lateral frontal and lateral parietal lobes, it seems that incoming flow is less than consumption. This affects BOLD sensitivity.

Hemoglobin differs in how it responds to magnetic fields, depending on whether it has a bound oxygen molecule. The dHb molecule is more attracted to magnetic fields. Hence, it distorts the surrounding magnetic field induced by an MRI scanner, causing the nuclei there to lose magnetization faster via the T2* decay. Thus MR pulse sequences sensitive to T2* show more MR signal where blood is highly oxygenated and less where it is not. This effect increases with the square of the strength of the magnetic field. The fMRI signal hence needs both a strong magnetic field (1.5 T or higher) and a pulse sequence such as EPI, which is sensitive to T2* contrast.

The physiological blood-flow response largely decides the temporal sensitivity, that is how accurately we can measure when neurons are active, in BOLD fMRI. The basic time resolution parameter (sampling time) is designated TR; the TR dictates how often a particular brain slice is excited and allowed to lose its magnetization. TRs could vary from the very short (500 ms) to the very long (3 s). For fMRI specifically, the hemodynamic response lasts over 10 seconds, rising multiplicatively (that is, as a proportion of current value), peaking at 4 to 6 seconds, and then falling multiplicatively. Changes in the blood-flow system, the vascular system, integrate responses to neuronal activity over time. Because this response is a smooth continuous function, sampling with ever-faster TRs does not help; it just gives more points on the response curve obtainable by simple linear interpolation anyway. Experimental paradigms such as staggering when a stimulus is presented at various trials can improve temporal resolution, but reduces the number of effective data points obtained.

==BOLD hemodynamic response==
The change in the MR signal from neuronal activity is called the hemodynamic response (HR). It lags the neuronal events triggering it by a couple of seconds, since it takes a while for the vascular system to respond to the brain&#x27;s need for glucose. From this point it typically rises to a peak at about 5 seconds after the stimulus. If the neurons keep firing, say from a continuous stimulus, the peak spreads to a flat plateau while the neurons stay active. After activity stops, the BOLD signal falls below the original level, the baseline, a phenomenon called the undershoot. Over time the signal recovers to the baseline. There is some evidence that continuous metabolic requirements in a brain region contribute to the undershoot.

The mechanism by which the neural system provides feedback to the vascular system of its need for more glucose is partly the release of glutamate as part of neuron firing. This glutamate affects nearby supporting cells, astrocytes, causing a change in calcium ion concentration. This, in turn, releases nitric oxide at the contact point of astrocytes and intermediate-sized blood vessels, the arterioles. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator causing arterioles to expand and draw in more blood.

A single voxel&#x27;s response signal over time is called its timecourse. Typically, the unwanted signal, called the noise, from the scanner, random brain activity and similar elements is as big as the signal itself. To eliminate these, fMRI studies repeat a stimulus presentation multiple times.

===Spatial resolution===
Spatial resolution of an fMRI study refers to how well it discriminates between nearby locations. It is measured by the size of voxels, as in MRI. A voxel is a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid, whose dimensions are set by the slice thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on the slice by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on specific regions of interest typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5 mm, or with laminar resolution fMRI (lfMRI), to submillimeter. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since scanning time directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A voxel typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on voxel size and the area of the brain being imaged.

The vascular arterial system supplying fresh blood branches into smaller and smaller vessels as it enters the brain surface and within-brain regions, culminating in a connected capillary bed within the brain. The drainage system, similarly, merges into larger and larger veins as it carries away oxygen-depleted blood. The dHb contribution to the fMRI signal is from both the capillaries near the area of activity and larger draining veins that may be farther away. For good spatial resolution, the signal from the large veins needs to be suppressed, since it does not correspond to the area where the neural activity is. This can be achieved either by using strong static magnetic fields or by using spin-echo pulse sequences. With these, fMRI can examine a spatial range from millimeters to centimeters, and can hence identify Brodmann areas (centimeters), subcortical nuclei such as the caudate, putamen and thalamus, and hippocampal subfields such as the combined dentate gyrus/CA3, CA1, and subiculum.

===Temporal resolution===
Temporal resolution is the smallest time period of neural activity reliably separated out by fMRI. One element deciding this is the sampling time, the TR. Below a TR of 1 or 2 seconds, however, scanning just generates sharper hemodynamic response (HR) curves, without adding much additional information (e.g. beyond what is alternatively achieved by mathematically interpolating the curve gaps at a lower TR). Temporal resolution can be improved by staggering stimulus presentation across trials. If one-third of data trials are sampled normally, one-third at 1 s, 4 s, 7 s and so on, and the last third at 2 s, 5 s and 8 s, the combined data provide a resolution of 1 s, though with only one-third as many total events.

The time resolution needed depends on brain processing time for various events. An example of the broad range here is given by the visual processing system. What the eye sees is registered on the photoreceptors of the retina within a millisecond or so. These signals get to the primary visual cortex via the thalamus in tens of milliseconds. Neuronal activity related to the act of seeing lasts for more than 100 ms. A fast reaction, such as swerving to avoid a car crash, takes around 200 ms. By about half a second, awareness and reflection of the incident sets in. Remembering a similar event may take a few seconds, and emotional or physiological changes such as fear arousal may last minutes or hours. Learned changes, such as recognizing faces or scenes, may last days, months, or years. Most fMRI experiments study brain processes lasting a few seconds, with the study conducted over some tens of minutes. Subjects may move their heads during that time, and this head motion needs to be corrected for. So does drift in the baseline signal over time. Boredom and learning may modify both subject behavior and cognitive processes.

===Linear addition from multiple activation===
When a person performs two tasks simultaneously or in overlapping fashion, the BOLD response is expected to add linearly. This is a fundamental assumption of many fMRI studies that is based on the principle that continuously differentiable systems can be expected to behave linearly when perturbations are small; they are linear to first order. Linear addition means the only operation allowed on the individual responses before they are combined (added together) is a separate scaling of each. Since scaling is just multiplication by a constant number, this means an event that evokes, say, twice the neural response as another, can be modeled as the first event presented twice simultaneously. The HR for the doubled-event is then just double that of the single event.

To the extent that the behavior is linear, the time course of the BOLD response to an arbitrary stimulus can be modeled by convolution of that stimulus with the impulse BOLD response. Accurate time course modeling is important in estimating the BOLD response magnitude.

This strong assumption was first studied in 1996 by Boynton and colleagues, who checked the effects on the primary visual cortex of patterns flickering 8 times a second and presented for 3 to 24 seconds. Their result showed that when visual contrast of the image was increased, the HR shape stayed the same but its amplitude increased proportionally. With some exceptions, responses to longer stimuli could also be inferred by adding together the responses for multiple shorter stimuli summing to the same longer duration. In 1997, Dale and Buckner tested whether individual events, rather than blocks of some duration, also summed the same way, and found they did. But they also found deviations from the linear model at time intervals less than 2 seconds.

A source of nonlinearity in the fMRI response is from the refractory period, where brain activity from a presented stimulus suppresses further activity on a subsequent, similar, stimulus. As stimuli become shorter, the refractory period becomes more noticeable. The refractory period does not change with age, nor do the amplitudes of HRs. The period differs across brain regions. In both the primary motor cortex and the visual cortex, the HR amplitude scales linearly with duration of a stimulus or response. In the corresponding secondary regions, the supplementary motor cortex, which is involved in planning motor behavior, and the motion-sensitive V5 region, a strong refractory period is seen and the HR amplitude stays steady across a range of stimulus or response durations. The refractory effect can be used in a way similar to habituation to see what features of a stimulus a person discriminates as new. Further limits to linearity exist because of saturation: with large stimulation levels a maximum BOLD response is reached.
==Matching neural activity to the BOLD signal==
Researchers have checked the BOLD signal against both signals from implanted electrodes (mostly in monkeys) and signals of field potentials (that is the electric or magnetic field from the brain&#x27;s activity, measured outside the skull) from EEG and MEG. The local field potential, which includes both post-neuron-synaptic activity and internal neuron processing, better predicts the BOLD signal. So the BOLD contrast reflects mainly the inputs to a neuron and the neuron&#x27;s integrative processing within its body, and less the output firing of neurons. In humans, electrodes can be implanted only in patients who need surgery as treatment, but evidence suggests a similar relationship at least for the auditory cortex and the primary visual cortex. Activation locations detected by BOLD fMRI in cortical areas (brain surface regions) are known to tally with CBF-based functional maps from PET scans. Some regions just a few millimeters in size, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which relays visual inputs from the retina to the visual cortex, have been shown to generate the BOLD signal correctly when presented with visual input. Nearby regions such as the pulvinar nucleus were not stimulated for this task, indicating millimeter resolution for the spatial extent of the BOLD response, at least in thalamic nuclei. In the rat brain, single-whisker touch has been shown to elicit BOLD signals from the somatosensory cortex.

However, the BOLD signal cannot separate feedback and feedforward active networks in a region; the slowness of the vascular response means the final signal is the summed version of the whole region&#x27;s network; blood flow is not discontinuous as the processing proceeds. Also, both inhibitory and excitatory input to a neuron from other neurons sum and contribute to the BOLD signal. Within a neuron these two inputs might cancel out. The BOLD response can also be affected by a variety of factors, including disease, sedation, anxiety, medications that dilate blood vessels, and attention (neuromodulation).

The amplitude of the BOLD signal does not necessarily affect its shape. A higher-amplitude signal may be seen for stronger neural activity, but peaking at the same place as a weaker signal. Also, the amplitude does not necessarily reflect behavioral performance. A complex cognitive task may initially trigger high-amplitude signals associated with good performance, but as the subject gets better at it, the amplitude may decrease with performance staying the same. This is expected to be due to increased efficiency in performing the task. The BOLD response across brain regions cannot be compared directly even for the same task, since the density of neurons and the blood-supply characteristics are not constant across the brain. However, the BOLD response can often be compared across subjects for the same brain region and the same task.

More recent characterization of the BOLD signal has used optogenetic techniques in rodents to precisely control neuronal firing while simultaneously monitoring the BOLD response using high field magnets (a technique sometimes referred to as &quot;optofMRI&quot;). These techniques suggest that neuronal firing is well correlated with the measured BOLD signal including approximately linear summation of the BOLD signal over closely spaced bursts of neuronal firing. Linear summation is an assumption of commonly used event-related fMRI designs.

==Medical use==

Physicians use fMRI to assess how risky brain surgery or similar invasive treatment is for a patient and to learn how a normal, diseased or injured brain is functioning. They map the brain with fMRI to identify regions linked to critical functions such as speaking, moving, sensing, or planning. This is useful to plan for surgery and radiation therapy of the brain.
Clinical use of fMRI still lags behind research use. Patients with brain pathologies are more difficult to scan with fMRI than are young healthy volunteers, the typical research-subject population. Tumors and lesions can change the blood flow in ways not related to neural activity, masking the neural HR. Drugs such as antihistamines and even caffeine can affect HR. Some patients may have disorders such as compulsive lying, which makes certain studies impossible. It is harder for those with clinical problems to stay still for long. Using head restraints or bite bars may injure epileptics who have a seizure inside the scanner; bite bars may also discomfort those with dental prostheses.

Despite these difficulties, fMRI has been used clinically to map functional areas, check left-right hemispherical asymmetry in language and memory regions, check the neural correlates of a seizure, study how the brain recovers partially from a stroke, and test how well a drug or behavioral therapy works. Mapping of functional areas and understanding lateralization of language and memory help surgeons avoid removing critical brain regions when they have to operate and remove brain tissue. This is of particular importance in removing tumors and in patients who have intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Lesioning tumors requires pre-surgical planning to ensure no functionally useful tissue is removed needlessly. Recovered depressed patients have shown altered fMRI activity in the cerebellum, and this may indicate a tendency to relapse. Pharmacological fMRI, assaying brain activity after drugs are administered, can be used to check how much a drug penetrates the blood–brain barrier and dose vs effect information of the medication.

==Animal research==
Research is primarily performed in non-human primates such as the rhesus macaque. These studies can be used both to check or predict human results and to validate the fMRI technique itself. But the studies are difficult because it is hard to motivate an animal to stay still and typical inducements such as juice trigger head movement while the animal swallows it. It is also expensive to maintain a colony of larger animals such as the macaque.

==Analyzing the data==
The goal of fMRI data analysis is to detect correlations between brain activation and a task the subject performs during the scan. It also aims to discover correlations with the specific cognitive states, such as memory and recognition, induced in the subject. The BOLD signature of activation is relatively weak, however, so other sources of noise in the acquired data must be carefully controlled. This means that a series of processing steps must be performed on the acquired images before the actual statistical search for task-related activation can begin. Nevertheless, it is possible to predict, for example, the emotions a person is experiencing solely from their fMRI, with a high degree of accuracy.

===Sources of noise===
Noise is unwanted changes to the MR signal from elements not of interest to the study. The five main sources of noise in fMRI are thermal noise, system noise, physiological noise, random neural activity and differences in both mental strategies and behavior across people and across tasks within a person. Thermal noise multiplies in line with the static field strength, but physiological noise multiplies as the square of the field strength. Since the signal also multiplies as the square of the field strength, and since physiological noise is a large proportion of total noise, higher field strengths above 3 T do not always produce proportionately better images.

Heat causes electrons to move around and distort the current in the fMRI detector, producing thermal noise. Thermal noise rises with the temperature. It also depends on the range of frequencies detected by the receiver coil and its electrical resistance. It affects all voxels similarly, independent of anatomy.

System noise is from the imaging hardware. One form is scanner drift, caused by the superconducting magnet&#x27;s field drifting over time. Another form is changes in the current or voltage distribution of the brain itself inducing changes in the receiver coil and reducing its sensitivity. A procedure called impedance matching is used to bypass this inductance effect. There could also be noise from the magnetic field not being uniform. This is often adjusted for by using shimming coils, small magnets physically inserted, say into the subject&#x27;s mouth, to patch the magnetic field. The nonuniformities are often near brain sinuses such as the ear and plugging the cavity for long periods can be discomfiting. The scanning process acquires the MR signal in k-space, in which overlapping spatial frequencies (that is repeated edges in the sample&#x27;s volume) are each represented with lines. Transforming this into voxels introduces some loss and distortions.

Physiological noise is from head and brain movement in the scanner from breathing, heart beats, or the subject fidgeting, tensing, or making physical responses such as button presses. Head movements cause the voxel-to-neurons mapping to change while scanning is in progress. Noise due to head movement is a particular issue when working with children, although there are measures that can be taken to reduce head motion when scanning children, such as changes in experimental design and training prior to the scanning session. Since fMRI is acquired in slices, after movement, a voxel continues to refer to the same absolute location in space while the neurons underneath it would have changed. Another source of physiological noise is the change in the rate of blood flow, blood volume, and use of oxygen over time. This last component contributes to two-thirds of physiological noise, which, in turn, is the main contributor to total noise.

Even with the best experimental design, it is not possible to control and constrain all other background stimuli impinging on a subject—scanner noise, random thoughts, physical sensations, and the like. These produce neural activity independent of the experimental manipulation. These are not amenable to mathematical modeling and have to be controlled by the study design.

A person&#x27;s strategies to respond or react to a stimulus, and to solve problems, often change over time and over tasks. This generates variations in neural activity from trial to trial within a subject. Across people too neural activity differs for similar reasons. Researchers often conduct pilot studies to see how participants typically perform for the task under consideration. They also often train subjects how to respond or react in a trial training session prior to the scanning one.

===Preprocessing===
The scanner platform generates a 3 D volume of the subject&#x27;s head every TR. This consists of an array of voxel intensity values, one value per voxel in the scan. The voxels are arranged one after the other, unfolding the three-dimensional structure into a single line. Several such volumes from a session are joined to form a 4 D volume corresponding to a run, for the time period the subject stayed in the scanner without adjusting head position. This 4 D volume is the starting point for analysis. The first part of that analysis is preprocessing.

The first step in preprocessing is conventionally slice timing correction. The MR scanner acquires different slices within a single brain volume at different times, and hence the slices represent brain activity at different timepoints. Since this complicates later analysis, a timing correction is applied to bring all slices to the same timepoint reference. This is done by assuming the timecourse of a voxel is smooth when plotted as a dotted line. Hence the voxel&#x27;s intensity value at other times not in the sampled frames can be calculated by filling in the dots to create a continuous curve.

Head motion correction is another common preprocessing step. When the head moves, the neurons under a voxel move and hence its timecourse now represents largely that of some other voxel in the past. Hence the timecourse curve is effectively cut and pasted from one voxel to another. Motion correction tries different ways of undoing this to see which undoing of the cut-and-paste produces the smoothest timecourse for all voxels. The undoing is by applying a rigid-body transform to the volume, by shifting and rotating the whole volume data to account for motion. The transformed volume is compared statistically to the volume at the first timepoint to see how well they match, using a cost function such as correlation or mutual information. The transformation that gives the minimal cost function is chosen as the model for head motion. Since the head can move in a vastly varied number of ways, it is not possible to search for all possible candidates; nor is there right now an algorithm that provides a globally optimal solution independent of the first transformations we try in a chain.

Distortion corrections account for field nonuniformities of the scanner. One method, as described before, is to use shimming coils. Another is to recreate a field map of the main field by acquiring two images with differing echo times. If the field were uniform, the differences between the two images also would be uniform. Note these are not true preprocessing techniques since they are independent of the study itself. Bias field estimation is a real preprocessing technique using mathematical models of the noise from distortion, such as Markov random fields and expectation maximization algorithms, to correct for distortion.

In general, fMRI studies acquire both many functional images with fMRI and a structural image with MRI. The structural image is usually of a higher resolution and depends on a different signal, the T1 magnetic field decay after excitation. To demarcate regions of interest in the functional image, one needs to align it with the structural one. Even when whole-brain analysis is done, to interpret the final results, that is to figure out which regions the active voxels fall in, one has to align the functional image to the structural one. This is done with a coregistration algorithm that works similar to the motion-correction one, except that here the resolutions are different, and the intensity values cannot be directly compared since the generating signal is different.

Typical MRI studies scan a few different subjects. To integrate the results across subjects, one possibility is to use a common brain atlas, and adjust all the brains to align to the atlas, and then analyze them as a single group. The atlases commonly used are the Talairach one, a single brain of an elderly woman created by Jean Talairach, and the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) one. The second is a probabilistic map created by combining scans from over a hundred individuals. This normalization to a standard template is done by mathematically checking which combination of stretching, squeezing, and warping reduces the differences between the target and the reference. While this is conceptually similar to motion correction, the changes required are more complex than just translation and rotation, and hence optimization even more likely to depend on the first transformations in the chain that is checked.

Temporal filtering is the removal of frequencies of no interest from the signal. A voxel&#x27;s intensity change over time can be represented as the sum of a number of different repeating waves with differing periods and heights. A plot with these periods on the x-axis and the heights on the y-axis is called a power spectrum, and this plot is created with the Fourier transform technique. Temporal filtering amounts to removing the periodic waves not of interest to us from the power spectrum, and then summing the waves back again, using the inverse Fourier transform to create a new timecourse for the voxel. A high-pass filter removes the lower frequencies, and the lowest frequency that can be identified with this technique is the reciprocal of twice the TR. A low-pass filter removes the higher frequencies, while a band-pass filter removes all frequencies except the particular range of interest.

Smoothing, or spatial filtering, is the idea of averaging the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.

===Statistical analysis===
One common approach to analysing fMRI data is to consider each voxel separately within the framework of the general linear model. The model assumes, at every time point, that the hemodynamic response (HR) is equal to the scaled and summed version of the events active at that point. A researcher creates a design matrix specifying which events are active at any timepoint. One common way is to create a matrix with one column per overlapping event, and one row per time point, and to mark it if a particular event, say a stimulus, is active at that time point. One then assumes a specific shape for the HR, leaving only its amplitude changeable in active voxels. The design matrix and this shape are used to generate a prediction of the exact HR of the voxel at every timepoint, using the mathematical procedure of convolution. This prediction does not include the scaling required for every event before summing them.

The basic model assumes the observed HR is the predicted HR scaled by the weights for each event and then added, with noise mixed in. This generates a set of linear equations with more equations than unknowns. A linear equation has an exact solution, under most conditions, when equations and unknowns match. Hence one could choose any subset of the equations, with the number equal to the number of variables, and solve them. But, when these solutions are plugged into the left-out equations, there will be a mismatch between the right and left sides, the error. The GLM model attempts to find the scaling weights that minimize the sum of the squares of the error. This method is provably optimal if the error were distributed as a bell curve, and if the scaling-and-summing model were accurate. For a more mathematical description of the GLM model, see generalized linear models.

The GLM model does not take into account the contribution of relationships between multiple voxels. Whereas GLM analysis methods assess whether a voxel or region&#x27;s signal amplitude is higher or lower for one condition than another, newer statistical models such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), utilize the unique contributions of multiple voxels within a voxel-population. In a typical implementation, a classifier or more basic algorithm is trained to distinguish trials for different conditions within a subset of the data. The trained model is then tested by predicting the conditions of the remaining (independent) data. This approach is most typically achieved by training and testing on different scanner sessions or runs. If the classifier is linear, then the training model is a set of weights used to scale the value in each voxel before summing them to generate a single number that determines the condition for each testing set trial. More information on training and testing classifiers is at statistical classification. MVPA allows for inferences about the information content of the underlying neural representations reflected in the BOLD signal, though there is a controversy about whether information detected by this method reflects information encoded at the level of columns, or higher spatial scales. Moreover, its harder to decode information from the prefrontal cortex compared to visual cortex and such differences in sensitivity across regions makes comparisons across regions problematic. Another method used the same fMRI dataset for visual object recognition in the human brain is depending on multi-voxel pattern analysis (fMRI voxels) and multi-view learning which is described in, this method used meta-heuristic search and mutual information to eliminate noisy voxels and select the significant BOLD signals.

==Combining with other methods==

It is common to combine fMRI signal acquisition with tracking of participants&#x27; responses and reaction times. Physiological measures such as heart rate, breathing, skin conductance (rate of sweating), and eye movements are sometimes captured simultaneously with fMRI. The method can also be combined with other brain-imaging techniques such as transcranial stimulation, direct cortical stimulation and, especially, EEG. The fMRI procedure can also be combined with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to have supplementary information about both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.

The fMRI technique can complement or supplement other techniques because of its unique strengths and gaps. It can noninvasively record brain signals without risks of ionising radiation inherent in other scanning methods, such as CT or PET scans. It can also record signal from all regions of the brain, unlike EEG/MEG, which are biased toward the cortical surface. But fMRI temporal resolution is poorer than that of EEG since the HR takes tens of seconds to climb to its peak. Combining EEG with fMRI is hence potentially powerful because the two have complementary strengths—EEG has high temporal resolution, and fMRI high spatial resolution. But simultaneous acquisition needs to account for the EEG signal from varying blood flow triggered by the fMRI gradient field, and the EEG signal from the static field. For details, see EEG vs fMRI.

While fMRI stands out due to its potential to capture neural processes associated with health and disease, brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have the power to alter these neural processes. Therefore, a combination of both is needed to investigate the mechanisms of action of TMS treatment and on the other hand introduce causality into otherwise pure correlational observations. The current state-of-the-art setup for these concurrent TMS/fMRI experiments comprises a large-volume head coil, usually a birdcage coil, with the MR-compatible TMS coil being mounted inside that birdcage coil. It was applied in a multitude of experiments studying local and network interactions. However, classic setups with the TMS coil placed inside MR birdcage-type head coil are characterised by poor signal to noise ratios compared to multi-channel receive arrays used in clinical neuroimaging today. Moreover, the presence of the TMS coil inside the MR birdcage coil causes artefacts beneath the TMS coil, i.e. at the stimulation target. For these reasons new MR coil arrays were currently developed dedicated to concurrent TMS/fMRI experiments.

==Issues in fMRI==

===Design===
If the baseline condition is too close to maximum activation, certain processes may not be represented appropriately. Another limitation on experimental design is head motion, which can lead to artificial intensity changes of the fMRI signal.

===Block versus event-related design===
In a block design, two or more conditions are alternated by blocks. Each block will have a duration of a certain number of fMRI scans and within each block only one condition is presented. By making the conditions differ in only the cognitive process of interest, the fMRI signal that differentiates the conditions should represent this cognitive process of interest. This is known as the subtraction paradigm.
The increase in fMRI signal in response to a stimulus is additive. This means that the amplitude of the hemodynamic response (HR) increases when multiple stimuli are presented in rapid succession. When each block is alternated with a rest condition in which the HR has enough time to return to baseline, a maximum amount of variability is introduced in the signal. As such, we conclude that block designs offer considerable statistical power. There are however severe drawbacks to this method, as the signal is very sensitive to signal drift, such as head motion, especially when only a few blocks are used. Another limiting factor is a poor choice of baseline, as it may prevent meaningful conclusions from being drawn. There are also problems with many tasks lacking the ability to be repeated. Since within each block only one condition is presented, randomization of stimulus types is not possible within a block. This makes the type of stimulus within each block very predictable. As a consequence, participants may become aware of the order of the events.

Event-related designs allow more real world testing, however, the statistical power of event related designs is inherently low, because the signal change in the BOLD fMRI signal following a single stimulus presentation is small.

Both block and event-related designs are based on the subtraction paradigm, which assumes that specific cognitive processes can be added selectively in different conditions. Any difference in blood flow (the BOLD signal) between these two conditions is then assumed to reflect the differing cognitive process. In addition, this model assumes that a cognitive process can be selectively added to a set of active cognitive processes without affecting them.

=== Overlap of signals ===
Overlapping signals in fMRI are a significant challenge in cognitive neuroscience research, particularly when multiple stimuli or tasks are presented in close temporal proximity. The BOLD response has a slow temporal resolution compared to the rapid succession of cognitive events. This causes signals from different brain processes to overlap, making it difficult to differentiate which neural activity is associated with specific stimuli or tasks. This overlap reduces the precision of event-related fMRI analyses, complicating interpretations of brain function.

Traditional fMRI designs, such as block or event-related designs, face limitations in managing this signal overlap, especially in studies with non-randomized, alternating designs, where the same tasks or stimuli may appear repeatedly and close together. As a result, the timing of stimuli becomes a crucial factor in ensuring that the fMRI signal from one event is sufficiently distinct from the next.

To address these challenges, researchers employ techniques like deconvolution, which mathematically separates the overlapping BOLD responses. In 2023, Das and colleagues demonstrated various ways on optimizing timing between individual events such that convolution of signals evoked by them that are close to each other can be minimized. These methods attempt to estimate the contribution of each neural event to the overall signal, allowing for more accurate interpretation of brain activity. Advances in analytical methods, such as specialized tools for optimizing experimental designs, are crucial for mitigating the effects of signal overlap and improving the reliability of fMRI studies.

===Baseline versus activity conditions===
The brain is never completely at rest. It never stops functioning and firing neuronal signals, as well as using oxygen as long as the person in question is alive. In fact, in Stark and Squire&#x27;s, 2001 study &quot;When zero is not zero: The problem of ambiguous baseline conditions in fMRI&quot;, activity in the medial temporal lobe (as well as in other brain regions) was substantially higher during rest than during several alternative baseline conditions. The effect of this elevated activity during rest was to reduce, eliminate, or even reverse the sign of the activity during task conditions relevant to memory functions. These results demonstrate that periods of rest are associated with significant cognitive activity and are therefore not an optimal baseline for cognition tasks. In order to discern baseline and activation conditions it is necessary to interpret a lot of information. This includes situations as simple as breathing. Periodic blocks may result in identical data of other variance in the data if the person breathes at a regular rate of 1 breath/5sec, and the blocks occur every 10s, thus impairing the data.

===Reverse inference===
Neuroimaging methods such as fMRI and MRI offer a measure of the activation of certain brain areas in response to cognitive tasks engaged in during the scanning process. Data obtained during this time allow cognitive neuroscientists to gain information regarding the role of particular brain regions in cognitive function. However, an issue arises when certain brain regions are alleged by researchers to identify the activation of previously labeled cognitive processes. Poldrack clearly describes this issue:
:The usual kind of inference that is drawn from neuroimaging data is of the form &#x27;if cognitive process X is engaged, then brain area Z is active.&#x27; Perusal of the discussion sections of a few fMRI articles will quickly reveal, however, an epidemic of reasoning taking the following form:
::(1) In the present study, when task comparison A was presented, brain area Z was active.
::(2) In other studies, when cognitive process X was putatively engaged, then brain area Z was active.
::(3) Thus, the activity of area Z in the present study demonstrates engagement of cognitive process X by task comparison A.
:This is a &#x27;reverse inference&#x27;, in that it reasons backwards from the presence of brain activation to the engagement of a particular cognitive function.
Reverse inference demonstrates the logical fallacy of affirming what you just found, although this logic could be supported by instances where a certain outcome is generated solely by a specific occurrence. With regard to the brain and brain function it is seldom that a particular brain region is activated solely by one cognitive process. Some suggestions to improve the legitimacy of reverse inference have included both increasing the selectivity of response in the brain region of interest and increasing the prior probability of the cognitive process in question. However, Poldrack suggests that reverse inference should be used merely as a guide to direct further inquiry rather than a direct means to interpret results.

===Forward inference===
Forward inference is a data driven method that uses patterns of brain activation to distinguish between competing cognitive theories. It shares characteristics with cognitive psychology&#x27;s dissociation logic and philosophy&#x27;s forward chaining. For example, Henson discusses forward inference&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;single process theory vs. dual process theory&quot; debate with regard to recognition memory. Forward inference supports the dual process theory by demonstrating that there are two qualitatively different brain activation patterns when distinguishing between &quot;remember vs. know judgments&quot;. The main issue with forward inference is that it is a correlational method. Therefore, one cannot be completely confident that brain regions activated during cognitive process are completely necessary for that execution of those processes. In fact, there are many known cases that demonstrate just that. For example, the hippocampus has been shown to be activated during classical conditioning, however lesion studies have demonstrated that classical conditioning can occur without the hippocampus.

==Health risks==
The most common risk to participants in an fMRI study is claustrophobia and there are reported risks for pregnant women to go through the scanning process. Scanning sessions also subject participants to loud high-pitched noises from Lorentz forces induced in the gradient coils by the rapidly switching current in the powerful static field. The gradient switching can also induce currents in the body causing nerve tingling. Implanted medical devices such as pacemakers could malfunction because of these currents. The radio-frequency field of the excitation coil may heat up the body, and this has to be monitored more carefully in those running a fever, the diabetic, and those with circulatory problems. Local burning from metal necklaces and other jewellery is also a risk.

The strong static magnetic field can cause damage by pulling in nearby heavy metal objects converting them to projectiles.

There is no proven risk of biological harm from even very powerful static magnetic fields. However, genotoxic (i.e., potentially carcinogenic) effects of MRI scanning have been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro, leading a recent review to recommend &quot;a need for further studies and prudent use in order to avoid unnecessary examinations, according to the precautionary principle&quot;. In a comparison of genotoxic effects of MRI compared with those of CT scans, Knuuti et al. reported that even though the DNA damage detected after MRI was at a level comparable to that produced by scans using ionizing radiation (low-dose coronary CT angiography, nuclear imaging, and X-ray angiography), differences in the mechanism by which this damage takes place suggests that the cancer risk of MRI, if any, is unknown.

==Advanced methods==
The first fMRI studies validated the technique against brain activity known, from other techniques, to be correlated to tasks. By the early 2000s, fMRI studies began to discover novel correlations. Still their technical disadvantages have spurred researchers to try more advanced ways to increase the power of both clinical and research studies.

===Better spatial resolution===
MRI, in general, has better spatial resolution than EEG and MEG, but not as good a resolution as invasive procedures such as single-unit electrodes. While typical resolutions are in the millimeter range, ultra-high-resolution MRI or MR spectroscopy works at a resolution of tens of micrometers. It uses 7 T fields, small-bore scanners that can fit small animals such as rats, and external contrast agents such as fine iron oxide. Fitting a human requires larger-bore scanners, which make higher fields strengths harder to achieve, especially if the field has to be uniform; it also requires either internal contrast such as BOLD or a non-toxic external contrast agent unlike iron oxide.

Parallel imaging is another technique to improve spatial resolution. This uses multiple coils for excitation and reception. Spatial resolution improves as the square root of the number of coils used. This can be done either with a phased array where the coils are combined in parallel and often sample overlapping areas with gaps in the sampling or with massive coil arrays, which are a much denser set of receivers separate from the excitation coils. These, however, pick up signals better from the brain surface, and less well from deeper structures such as the hippocampus. 

===Better temporal resolution===
Temporal resolution of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism that raises the blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait until net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher has an idea of the expected shape of the activation image.

Typical gradient-echo EPI uses two gradient coils within a slice, and turns on first one coil and then the other, tracing a set of lines in k-space. Turning on both gradient coils can generate angled lines, which cover the same grid space faster. Both gradient coils can also be turned on in a specific sequence to trace a spiral shape in k-space. This spiral imaging sequence acquires images faster than gradient-echo sequences, but needs more math transformations (and consequent assumptions) since converting back to voxel space requires the data be in grid form (a set of equally spaced points in both horizontal and vertical directions).

===New contrast mechanisms===
BOLD contrast depends on blood flow, which is both sluggish in response to stimulus and subject to noisy influences. Other biomarkers now looked at to provide better contrast include temperature, acidity/alkalinity (pH), calcium-sensitive agents, neuronal magnetic field, and the Lorentz effect. Temperature contrast depends on changes in brain temperature from its activity. The initial burning of glucose raises the temperature, and the subsequent inflow of fresh, cold blood lowers it. These changes alter the magnetic properties of tissue. Since the internal contrast is too difficult to measure, external agents such as thulium compounds are used to enhance the effect. Contrast based on pH depends on changes in the acid/alkaline balance of brain cells when they go active. This too often uses an external agent. Calcium-sensitive agents make MRI more sensitive to calcium concentrations, with calcium ions often being the messengers for cellular signalling pathways in active neurons. Neuronal magnetic field contrast measures the magnetic and electric changes from neuronal firing directly. Lorentz-effect imaging tries to measure the physical displacement of active neurons carrying an electric current within the strong static field.

==Commercial use==
Some experiments have shown the neural correlates of peoples&#x27; brand preferences. Samuel M. McClure used fMRI to show the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and midbrain were more active when people knowingly drank Coca-Cola as opposed to when they drank unlabeled Coke. Other studies have shown the brain activity that characterizes men&#x27;s preference for sports cars, and even differences between Democrats and Republicans in their reaction to campaign commercials with images of the 9/11 attacks. Neuromarketing companies have seized on these studies as a better tool to poll user preferences than the conventional survey technique. One such company was BrightHouse, now shut down. Another is Oxford, UK-based Neurosense, which advises clients how they could potentially use fMRI as part of their marketing business activity. A third is Sales Brain in California.

At least two companies have been set up to use fMRI in lie detection: No Lie MRI and the Cephos Corporation . No Lie MRI charges close to $5000 for its services. These companies depend on evidence such as that from a study by Joshua Greene at Harvard University suggesting the prefrontal cortex is more active in those contemplating lying.

However, there is still a fair amount of controversy over whether these techniques are reliable enough to be used in a legal setting . Some studies indicate that while there is an overall positive correlation, there is a great deal of variation between findings and in some cases considerable difficulty in replicating the findings. A federal magistrate judge in Tennessee prohibited fMRI evidence to back up a defendant&#x27;s claim of telling the truth, on the grounds that such scans do not measure up to the legal standard of scientific evidence.. Most researchers agree that the ability of fMRI to detect deception in a real life setting has not been established.

Use of the fMRI has been left out of legal debates throughout its history. Use of this technology has not been allowed due to holes in the evidence supporting fMRI. First, most evidence supporting fMRIs accuracy was done in a lab under controlled circumstances with solid facts. This type of testing does not pertain to real life. Real-life scenarios can be much more complicated with many other affecting factors. It has been shown that many other factors affect BOLD other than a typical lie. There have been tests done showing that drug use alters blood flow in the brain, which drastically affects the outcome of BOLD testing. Furthermore, individuals with diseases or disorders such as schizophrenia or compulsive lying can lead to abnormal results as well. Lastly, there is an ethical question relating to fMRI scanning. This testing of BOLD has led to controversy over if fMRIs are an invasion of privacy. Being able to scan and interpret what people are thinking may be thought of as immoral and the controversy still continues.

Because of these factors and more, fMRI evidence has been excluded from any form of legal system. The testing is too uncontrolled and unpredictable. Therefore, it has been stated that fMRI has much more testing to do before it can be considered viable in the eyes of the legal system.

==Criticism==
Some scholars have criticized fMRI studies for problematic statistical analyses, often based on low-power, small-sample studies. Other fMRI researchers have defended their work as valid. In 2018, Turner and colleagues have suggested that the small sizes affect the replicability of task-based fMRI studies and claimed that even datasets with at least 100 participants the results may not be well replicated, although there are debates on it.

In one real but satirical fMRI study, a dead salmon was shown pictures of humans in different emotional states. The authors provided evidence, according to two different commonly used statistical tests, of areas in the salmon&#x27;s brain suggesting meaningful activity. The study was used to highlight the need for more careful statistical analyses in fMRI research, given the large number of voxels in a typical fMRI scan and the multiple comparisons problem. Before the controversies were publicized in 2010, between 25 and 40% of studies on fMRI being published were not using the corrected comparisons. But by 2012, that number had dropped to 10%. Dr. Sally Satel, writing in Time, cautioned that while brain scans have scientific value, individual brain areas often serve multiple purposes and &quot;reverse inferences&quot; as commonly used in press reports carry a significant chance of drawing invalid conclusions.
In 2015, it was discovered that a statistical bug was found in the fMRI computations which likely invalidated at least 40,000 fMRI studies preceding 2015, and researchers suggest that results prior to the bug fix cannot be relied upon. Furthermore, it was later shown that how one sets the parameters in the software determines the false positive rate. In other words, study outcome can be determined by changing software parameters.

In 2020 professor Ahmad Hariri, (Duke University) one of the first researchers to use fMRI, performed a largescale experiment that sought to test the reliability of fMRI on individual people.
In the study, he copied protocols from 56 published papers in psychology that used fMRI. The results suggest that fMRI has poor reliability when it comes to individual cases, but good reliability when it comes to general human thought patterns

<text>Andy Capp is a British comic strip created by cartoonist Reg Smythe, seen in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; newspapers since 5 August 1957. Originally a single-panel cartoon, it was later expanded to four panels.

The strip is syndicated internationally by Creators Syndicate. The character is also licensed as the mascot for a line of snack foods (Andy Capp&#x27;s fries).

==Characters and story==

*Andy (short for Andrew) Capp
*Florrie &quot;Flo&quot; Capp (named after Florence Nightingale)
*Chalkie White
*Ruby &quot;Rube&quot; White
*Percy Ritson, the rent collector
*Jackie the barman
*The Vicar
*Flo&#x27;s Mum (never seen)
*Minor recurring characters include various constables, barmaids, barmen, referees, footballers, pub locals, door-to-door salesmen, debt collectors, job centre employees, and Guitar Bob.

Andy is a working-class figure who never actually works, living in Hartlepool, a harbour town in County Durham, in North East England. The title of the strip is a pun on the local pronunciation of &quot;handicap&quot;; and the surname Capp signifies how Andy&#x27;s cap always covered his eyes along with, metaphorically, his vision in life. Handicap racing and handicapping, in sport and games, is part of betting, a favourite activity of Andy Capp.

Andy&#x27;s hobbies and activities include pigeon racing, darts, snooker (his cue&#x27;s name is Delilah), playing football (which always involves fights with the other players, and frequently ends with Andy being sent off), occasional cricket and rugby, betting on horses (and usually losing badly), getting drunk in the local pub (often falling into the canal and being fished out by a constable, and usually arriving home late as a result), ending up in the local gaol, fishing (and not catching anything bigger than a goldfish), unsuccessfully mooching money from everyone for beer, unsuccessfully flirting with barmaids (also yelling at them when he is not served), attempting to pick up bargirls (and usually being rejected, although sometimes he is actually successful), loafing and napping on the sofa, playing poker (and usually cheating with hidden cards, although plainly seen by the readers), and fighting with his long-suffering wife Florrie (also known as &quot;Flo&quot;), as well as being served burnt food by her.

Andy&#x27;s iconic checked flat cap is always pulled down over his eyes, even when he is napping or bathing. He is often unshaven, frequently intoxicated (indicated by a prominent red nose and dishevelled clothing), lazy, freeloading, belligerent, and confrontational, but just as frequently lovable (he always refers to Flo as &quot;pet&quot;, and will instantly &quot;bop&quot; anyone who dares to be rude to her). Until the 1980s he was often seen with a cigarette dangling from his lip. When Andy gave up smoking in 1983 some readers blamed political correctness. However, Fergus McKenna, head of syndication at Trinity Mirror which publishes the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, denied that the newspaper had put pressure on Smythe to change Andy&#x27;s habits, saying: &quot;The truth is that Reg himself gave up smoking and he said there was no way Andy was going to carry on enjoying cigarettes when Reg couldn&#x27;t&quot;. Andy and Florrie now attend marriage counselling.

Andy and Florrie are always on the verge of poverty. Although Flo works regularly as a charwoman, Andy is unemployed and lacks motivation. Rent on their terraced house and its contents is constantly in arrears, and the rent collector, Percy Ritson, despairs of ever being paid. He, as well as several others, always nag Andy to get himself a job, which is usually met with him clobbering them.

Percy is also always confronting Andy on the way he treats Flo. It&#x27;s obvious Percy has a crush on Flo and believes he would treat her far better than Andy does. This has led the two men to fight.

Their furniture has been repossessed on several occasions. Somehow they always manage to retrieve it, and Andy is always able to afford beer and gambling money, usually by borrowing from Florrie.

Almost all the characters occasionally &quot;break the fourth wall&quot; by delivering asides directly to the reader, or even as a very terse &#x27;thought bubble&#x27;, usually referring to Andy&#x27;s low character, but more regularly by a character simply cutting their eyes to the reader in the final panel whenever something is said or done by Andy that the character finds unbelievable. The 24 October 1972 strip revealed that Andy once worked as a sign painter, but had not worked at that trade (or any other) for many years. Should anyone suggest he get a job, his response is often very terse and along the lines of &#x27;Don&#x27;t be so ridiculous!&#x27; and sometimes leads to fisticuffs.

He occasionally visits the Job Centre (Labour Exchange) and is sometimes shown finding excuses why he cannot take a job that seems suitable for him, preferring instead to collect his &quot;dole money&quot; (government unemployment assistance). On more than one occasion, it is mentioned that Andy had been in the army (with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, Reg Smythe&#x27;s regiment) and was a World War II veteran of the North African campaign. According to Don Markstein,

The strip takes place almost exclusively in one of three locations: the pub, the street, or inside the Capps&#x27; residence at 37 Durham Street (generally with Andy on the couch and Florrie yelling from the next room). Less-frequently visited places include the racetrack (although Andy frequently bets by listening to the radio, thus saving him the trip), the marriage counsellor, and the football pitch (where Andy is either fighting, quarrelling, being sent off, or carried off on a stretcher).

Andy&#x27;s and Flo&#x27;s best friends are their neighbours Chalkie and Rube White. Chalkie is a hard-drinking working-class type like Andy, who can often be seen sharing a pint with him at the corner pub, but Chalkie seems mellower than Andy, and more tolerant of his wife. Rube is Flo&#x27;s confidante, and the two often trade gossip over the clothesline about their husbands&#x27; latest escapades. The local vicar is also often seen. Andy despairs of his holier-than-thou attitude, as he is constantly criticising Andy for his many bad habits and vice-ridden lifestyle. He often lets his opinion be known to Flo, who agrees with his low assessment of Andy&#x27;s character.

At times, Flo will forcibly remove Andy from the pub when she feels he has been there for far too long (even at times, missing his tea meal). When he comes home, especially in the earlier strips, Flo often confronted him about his doings, sometimes striking him with either her fist or anything she could grab, for example a rolling pin, cricket bat or something similar with the intent to clobber him. However, Flo is not without her own vices. She (along with Rube) will go to bingo with the same frequency as Andy goes to the pub.

Whenever this happened (also mainly in the earlier strips), the roles are then reversed, with Andy usually confronting Flo for being late from going to bingo and sometimes striking her with either his fist or chasing her out the door with a push broom or a chair with the intent to clobber her with said object.

She had also lost cleaning jobs due to her love of bingo.

Flo is also not a very good cook, regularly burning the meals with her lack of cooking skills. This often sends Andy into a rage and off to the nearest café for a meal.

Flo was Smythe&#x27;s favourite character and shares the name with his real-life mother. &quot;She should have been included in the title, but I wanted a single name and the pun on &quot;handicap&quot; was irresistible.&quot;

Flo&#x27;s mother, an unseen character whose dialogue appears from out of frame, often chimes into the conversation, mostly with sarcastic criticism of her son-in-law (her feet and legs appear in one panel where she has passed out after Andy offers her too much to drink). Flo&#x27;s &quot;mam&quot;, whom Andy addresses only as &quot;Missus&quot;, is often the subject of Andy&#x27;s pointed barbs about her weight and less-than-sunny disposition, but she has been known to give as good as she gets. Andy&#x27;s mother was similarly mentioned and also delivered dialogue from offstage, but her &quot;appearances&quot; were cut back significantly as the years passed. Andy&#x27;s father has also been mentioned. Flo has an older sister named Polly who is seen once, and a never-seen brother. Andy had a pet whippet, Nancy, and has always kept pigeons.

Two of the constables who observe Andy&#x27;s drunken behaviour are named Alan and Trevor.

==Continuation==
Reg Smythe died on 13 June 1998, but the original strip has continued. For some time, the writer and artist were uncredited, but in November 2004 the strip began to carry a credit for Roger Mahoney (artist) and Roger Kettle (writer). Circa 2011, Kettle discontinued his work on the strip and was replaced by Lawrence Goldsmith and Sean Garnett, while Mahoney continued to draw. The appearance of the characters did not change perceptibly.

Towards the end of 2020, Mahoney&#x27;s credit began to be left off strips with a subtle but noticeably different style in both lettering and art. This led to at least one industry source inferring that Mahoney, at 87 years of age, and 65 years of cartooning, had retired. Mahoney died at 89, on 29 November 2022.

Strips into 2021 and beyond only show credits for writers Goldsmith and Garnett and continue the subtly different style.

===Animated appearances===
In May 2012, Andy Capp (as well as Flo, Chalkie White, the Vicar, and Jackie the Barman) appeared as an animated series for the first time in promotional material for The Trinity Mirror-owned MirrorBingo.com website. The animation was created by Teesside-born Chris Hunneysett, who drew from his own background to place Andy Capp in Middlesbrough. Andy Capp had previously appeared in animated form in television adverts for the Post Office (1986) and Kit Kat (1993).

==Awards==

Smythe received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Humor Comic Strip Award for the strip in 1974.

A statue of Andy Capp was erected in Hartlepool on 28 June 2007. It was sculpted by Jane Robbins.

==Adaptations==

===Stage===
In 1981, a stage musical based on the strip had a short run at London&#x27;s Aldwych Theatre, with songs by Alan Price and Trevor Peacock, starring Tom Courtenay as Andy and Val McLane as Florrie. The stage show also produced an original West End cast recording, released on LP record by Key Records in 1982. The musical was reprised in 2016 at the Finborough Theatre in London, with Roger Alborough portraying Andy.

===Television===

An attempt to transfer Andy Capp to television in 1988 met with little success. The well-known British character actor James Bolam played Andy on ITV. The Thames Television series consisted of six episodes that were shown once and have never been repeated. The series was poorly received and attracted some criticism for the way it played up to supposed stereotypes of Northern working-class men. In 2012 the series was released on DVD (Region 2) in the UK, licensed by Fremantle Media Ltd to the Network Label (VFD64669 / Network 7953656).

===Computer game===

In 1987, a computer game based on &quot;Andy Capp&quot;, entitled &quot;Andy Capp: The Game&quot;, was released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in Europe and North America. Players had to borrow money in order to replenish Andy&#x27;s alcohol supply while avoiding fights with his wife Flo and the police.

===Snack food===
In 1971, the American company Goodmark Foods licensed the character in the form of &quot;Andy Capp&#x27;s&quot;, a fried snack food made to resemble french fries.

===Around the world===
A Konkani language adaptation of the comic strip, known as &quot;Anton Chepekar&quot; (आंंतोन चेपेंकार) used to feature in the Konkani daily &quot;Sunaparant&quot;.

==Appearances in other media==
Andy Capp appeared twice in &quot;Family Guy&quot;. In the first appearance, he and Peter are playing darts at a bar and, when an angry Flo appears, she and Andy have a comic-strip style fight, into which Quagmire is unwittingly drawn. The second appearance is when he performs a version of a pap smear, referred to as a &quot;Capp&quot; smear, on Lois. On both occasions, he speaks with a Cockney accent.

==Related comics==
When the children&#x27;s comic &quot;Buster&quot; was launched in 1960, its masthead character was entitled &quot;Buster: Son of Andy Capp&quot;. Buster wore a cloth cap similar to Andy&#x27;s until 1992, but the connection was not recognised in the parent strip and had limited development in the children&#x27;s comic. Buster often referred to his father, and Andy was seen in the comic attempting to find a gas leak in three frames of the 18 June 1960 strip. He was also shown in two drawn photographs in the 2 July 1960 issue, the first of which was displayed by Buster&#x27;s mum with the pronouncement: &quot;It&#x27;s a photo of Buster taken with Andy! You can see he&#x27;s got his dad&#x27;s fine straight nose&quot;. Buster&#x27;s mum was often referred to by name and was consistently drawn to resemble Andy&#x27;s wife Flo. The connection with Andy Capp was soon dropped from the comic.

<doc id="226729" wikidata="Q878040" url="?curid=226729" title="Divisions of Bangladesh">
<text>Divisions are the first-level administrative divisions in Bangladesh. As of 2024, there are eight divisions of Bangladesh, each named after the major city within its jurisdiction that also serves as the administrative seat of that division. Each division is divided into several districts which are further subdivided into upazilas (sub-districts), then union councils.

==History==
Following the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the country had four divisions: Chittagong Division, Dacca Division, Khulna Division, and Rajshahi Division. In 1982, the English spelling of the Dacca Division (along with the name of the capital city) was changed into Dhaka Division to more closely match the Bengali pronunciation.

In 1993, Barisal Division was split off from Khulna Division, and in 1995, Sylhet Division was split off from Chittagong Division. On 25 January 2010, Rangpur Division was split off from Rajshahi Division. On 14 September 2015, Mymensingh Division was split off from Dhaka Division and added as the eighth division. In 2015, the process started to create two more divisions: Comilla Division and Faridpur Division. In October 2021, the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced the formation of two new divisions, Meghna and Padma, named after the eponymous rivers, in the places of Comilla and Faridpur Divisions.

==Divisional Commissioner==
Divisional Commissioner is the administrative head of a division. Divisional Commissioner is appointed by the government from an Additional Secretary level officer of Bangladesh Civil Service (B.C.S.) Administration Cadre. The role of a Divisional Commissioner&#x27;s office is to act as the supervisory head of all the government offices (except the central government offices) situated in the division. A Divisional Commissioner is given the direct responsibility of supervising the revenue and development administration of a division. The Divisional Commissioner is assisted by the several Additional Divisional Commissioners, Senior Assistant Commissioners and other bureaucratic officials.

==List of divisions==
The following table outlines some key statistics about the eight divisions of Bangladesh as found in the 2011 Population and Housing Census conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (B.B.S.).

==Proposed divisions==
Two more divisions have been proposed to ease down administrative work load due to increase in population:

* Padma Division – proposed to consist of Faridpur, Gopalganj, Madaripur, Rajbari, and Shariatpur districts.

Their formation has been confirmed in October 2021 by the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

* Meghna Division – proposed to consist of the six northern districts of the current Chittagong Division: Brahmanbaria, Chandpur, Comilla, Feni, Laxmipur, and Noakhali.

After the outcust of Sheikh Hasina, On 17 December 2024, the Public Administration Reform Commission of the Interim government of Bangladesh recommended the creation of the Comilla division and Faridpur division, which has been applauded by many residents and others.

<doc id="226730" wikidata="Q626933" url="?curid=226730" title="Boilermaker (beer cocktail)">
<text>A boilermaker is either of two types of beer cocktail. In American terminology, the drink consists of a glass of beer mixed with a shot of whiskey.

==Name==
The drink originated in Butte, Montana, in the 1890s, and was originally called a &quot;Sean O&#x27;Farrell&quot; and was served only when miners ended their shifts. When the beer is served as a chaser, the drink is often called simply &quot;a shot and a beer&quot;.

In England, the term &quot;boilermaker&quot; traditionally refers to a half pint of draught mild mixed with a half pint of bottled brown ale. In the south-west of England it is also known as a &#x27;brown split&#x27;, although it also refers to the American shot and pint. In Scotland, &quot;a half and a half&quot; is a half pint of beer with a whisky (&quot;a wee hawf&quot;). The use of these terms in Scottish and English pubs can be traced back to about 1920.

==Drinking==
There are a number of ways to drink an American beer chaser:

* Traditionally, the liquor is consumed in a single gulp and is then &quot;chased&quot; by the beer, which is sipped.
* The liquor and beer may be mixed by pouring or dropping the shot into the beer. The mixture may be stirred. If the shot glass is dropped into the beer glass, the drink can also be known as a depth charge.

==Similar drinks==

Other pairings of a shot and a beer are possible; traditional pairings include:
* &quot;Herrengedeck&quot; (&quot;gentlemen&#x27;s menu&quot;), a German pairing of Korn (grain brandy) and beer
* &quot;Regenschirm&quot; (&quot;umbrella&quot;), a German pairing of &quot;Allasch&quot; and Gose
* &quot;&quot;, a German pairing of top-fermented beer and Korn.
* Irish car bomb (cocktail), a pairing of a shot of Irish cream and whiskey into a glass of stout
* (&quot;little headbutt&quot;), a Dutch pairing of Jenever (Dutch gin) and beer, term attested 1943
* Somaek or Poktan-ju, a Korean pairing of soju and beer
* The Chicago Handshake or Chicago Drive-by, a shot of Jeppson&#x27;s Malört alongside Old Style beer
* The Citywide, sometimes called the Citywide Special, a Philadelphia pairing of a shot of Jim Beam and a Pabst Blue Ribbon

<text>Nigeria is a federation of 36 states, each of which is a semi-autonomous political unit that shares power with the federal government as enumerated under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In addition to the states, there is the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), in which the capital city of Abuja is located. The FCT is not a state, but a territory of the federal government, governed by an administration headed by a minister. Each state is subdivided into local government areas (LGAs). There are 774 local governments in Nigeria. Under the Nigerian Constitution, the 36 states enjoy substantial autonomy but are not sovereign entities, as ultimate authority lies with the federal government. Amendments to the constitution can be proposed by the National Assembly, but for an amendment to be valid, it must be approved by a two-third majority of the 36 state legislatures, as required under Section 9 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria.

== Current states and the Federal Capital Territory ==

== Evolution of Nigerian administrative divisions ==
==Government==
States of Nigeria have the right to organize and structure their individual governments in any way within the parameters set by the Constitution of Nigeria.

===Legislature===
At the state level, the legislature is unicameral, with the number of its members equal to three times the number of legislators it has in the Federal House of Representatives. It has the power to legislate on matters on the concurrent list.

===Executive===
At the state level, the head of the executive is the governor, who has the power to appoint people to the state executive council, subject to the advice and consent of the state house of assembly (legislature). The head of a ministry at the state level is the commissioner, who is assisted by a permanent secretary, who is also a senior civil servant of the state.

===Judiciary===
The Judiciary is one of the co-equal arms of the state government concerned with the interpretation of the laws of the state government. The judiciary is headed by the chief justice of the state appointed by the president subject to the approval of the state house of assembly.

<doc id="226736" wikidata="Q1561362" url="?curid=226736" title="2002 Irish general election">
<text>The 2002 Irish general election to the 29th Dáil was held on Friday, 17 May, just over three weeks after the dissolution of the 28th Dáil on Thursday, 25 April by President Mary McAleese, at the request of the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern. The general election took place in 42 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 166 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas, with a revision of constituencies since the last election under the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1998. The outgoing minority Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrat administration was returned with a majority of 10.

The 29th Dáil met at Leinster House on Thursday, 6 June to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Bertie Ahern was re-appointed Taoiseach, forming the 26th government of Ireland, a majority coalition government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.

==Overview==

The general election was significant for a number of reasons:

*The election was considered a success for Fianna Fáil, with the party coming within a handful of seats from achieving an overall majority (the nearest the country came to a single-party government since 1987) and winning the most first-preference votes in every single Dáil constituency. The only high-profile loss was cabinet minister Mary O&#x27;Rourke losing her seat in Westmeath.
*The re-election of the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats government, the first occasion since 1969 that an Irish government won re-election.
*The meltdown in Fine Gael support, which saw the main opposition party drop from 54 to 31 seats, and lose all but three seats in Dublin.
*The failure of the Labour Party, contrary to all expectations, to increase its seat total. Later in the year, Ruairi Quinn stepped down as leader of the Labour Party. He was replaced by Pat Rabbitte, who was one of four Democratic Left TDs who joined in a merger with Labour in 1999. The most high-profile loss for the party was the defeat of former leader Dick Spring in Kerry.
*The success of the Green Party, which increased its TDs from two to six, including its first Teachta Dála (TD) outside of Dublin.
*The electoral success of Sinn Féin, which increased its seat number from one to five.
*The election of a large number of independent candidates.
*Contrary to what opinion polls and political pundits were predicting, the Progressive Democrats kept all of their seats, and picked up four more.
*It was the first time electronic voting machines were used in an Irish election. They were used in three constituencies: Dublin North, Dublin West and Meath. They would not be used again at a general election.

==Fine Gael==
The most noticeable feature of the election was the collapse in Fine Gael&#x27;s vote. It suffered its second worst electoral result ever (after the 1948 general election), with several prominent members failing to get re-elected, including:
*Alan Dukes – former party leader
*Jim Mitchell – deputy leader
*Nora Owen – former deputy leader and former Minister for Justice
*Austin Currie – former presidential candidate
*Jim Higgins – former Chief Whip
*Alan Shatter – front bench member
*Deirdre Clune – front bench member
*Michael Creed – front bench member
*Frances Fitzgerald – front bench member

The party&#x27;s losses were especially pronounced in Dublin, where just three TDs (Richard Bruton, Gay Mitchell and Olivia Mitchell) were returned, fewer than Fianna Fáil, Labour, the Progressive Democrats or the Greens.
The reasons for the drop in support for Fine Gael are many and varied:
*There was an element of bad luck in some losses, and the proportion of seats they lost (42.6%) was much greater than the proportion of votes (25.2%).
*In 2002, the Irish economy was booming, unemployment was low, and the outgoing government was a stable one that had lasted its full term.
*No other opposition party, noticeably Labour, would agree to a pre-election pact with Fine Gael, sensing the unpopularity of the party. This meant that no-one felt that Fine Gael would be able to lead a government after the election. In contrast, the two parties of the outgoing government fought the election on a united front.
*The Fine Gael party was poorly organised in Dublin, and morale was low.
*The political landscape had changed in Ireland since Fine Gael&#x27;s heyday in the 1980s. The Progressive Democrats and the Green Party in particular ate into Fine Gael&#x27;s middle class support, and anti-Fianna Fáil voters had a much wider range of parties to choose from. All 4 of the extra seats won by the Green Party were at the expense of Fine Gael, as were 3 out of 4 of the Progressive Democrats&#x27; gains.
*Toward the end of the campaign, Michael McDowell warned that because Fianna Fáil were so high in the opinion polls, they could form a government by themselves. This led to a significant shift to the Progressive Democrats at the last minute, and many Fine Gael voters voted strategically for the Progressive Democrats to avoid a single-party Fianna Fáil government.

In the immediate aftermath of the election, Fine Gael leader Michael Noonan announced his resignation from the leadership and Enda Kenny was chosen as the new leader in the subsequent election.

==Results==







Independents include Independent Health Alliance candidates (12,296 votes, 1 seat) and Independent Fianna Fáil (6,124 votes, 1 seat).

===Voting summary===
===Seats summary===
==Government formation==
Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats formed the 26th government of Ireland, a majority coalition government. it is the only coalition government in Irish politics to have been returned after a general election.

==Dáil membership changes==
The following changes took place as a result of the election:
*22 outgoing TDs retired
*143 TDs stood for re-election (plus the Ceann Comhairle, Séamus Pattison who was automatically returned)
**110 of those were re-elected
**33 failed to be re-elected
*55 successor TDs were elected
**47 were elected for the first time
**8 had previously been TDs
*There were 7 successor female TDs, replacing 6 outgoing, increasing the total number by 1 to 22
*There were changes in 38 of 42 constituencies contested

Outgoing TDs are listed in the constituency they contested in the election. For some, such as Marian McGennis, this differs from the constituency they represented in the outgoing Dáil. Where more than one change took place in a constituency the concept of successor is an approximation for presentation only.

The cross-party seat transfers are summarized thus:

==Seanad election==
The Dáil election was followed by the election to the 22nd Seanad.

<text>Pacific Lutheran University (PLU) is a private Lutheran university in Parkland, Washington. It was founded by Norwegian Lutheran immigrants in 1890. PLU is sponsored by the 580 congregations of Region I of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. PLU has approximately 2,700 students enrolled. As of 2023, the school employs approximately 238 full-time professors on the woodland campus.

PLU’s academic programs into four colleges: the College of Health Professions; the College of Humanities, Interdisciplinary Studies, and Social Sciences; the College of Natural Sciences; and the College of Professional Studies.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The university was chartered by the State of Washington as the Pacific Lutheran Academy on December 11, 1890. In naming the university, the Norwegian immigrants who founded it recognized the role that a Lutheran educational institution on the Western frontier could play in the region. They wanted the institution to help immigrants adjust to their new land and find jobs, but they also wanted it to produce graduates who would serve church and community. Education—and educating for service—was a venerated part of the Scandinavian traditions from which these pioneers came.

Classes first began in 1894 with the student body consisting of 30 students. Tuition at the time cost $1 per week. Bjug Harstad was the school&#x27;s first president. The entire university was housed in one building from 1894 to 1912. This building was formerly known as Old Main but has since been renamed Harstad Hall in honor of the school&#x27;s founding president.

In 1898, the university&#x27;s name was changed to Pacific Lutheran Academy and Business College. Attempting to eliminate the debt plaguing the school, Bjug Harstad left for Alaska to search for gold. He spent one and one half years there but was unable to discover any gold. In 1902, the PLA athletic club celebrated its first victory in men&#x27;s basketball with a 15–12 win over the University of Washington. Five years later women would be allowed to play basketball.

In 1912, a second building, a gymnasium, was constructed on the university campus. It included a track, a stage, and a science laboratory in the basement. Two years later students built a tennis court in what is now Red Square. By 1914, PLA received full accreditation meaning students could transfer to universities and retain their credits.

Although founded as a university, the institution functioned primarily as an academy until 1918, when it suspended instruction for two years. It reopened as the two-year Pacific Lutheran College, after merging with Columbia Lutheran College, previously located in Everett. Further consolidations occurred when Spokane College merged with PLC in 1929. Four-year baccalaureate degrees were first offered in education in 1939 and in the liberal arts in 1942. The institution was reorganized as a university in 1960, reclaiming its original name.

=== Pacific Lutheran College ===

In 1920, the school merged with Columbia College in Everett, Washington, and reopened as Pacific Lutheran College. The reopening of the school also saw the construction of a new building, the chapel. Classes were held in the chapel until 1967. The chapel was also the home of Trinity Lutheran Church until the congregation built its own church in 1937.

The school&#x27;s first football team was launched in 1926. They were originally known as the &quot;Greyhounds&quot;, then the &quot;Gladiators&quot; (although they are unofficially referred to as the &quot;Lutes&quot;). That same year Polly Langlow, a member of PLC&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball team, scored 270 points in 12 games setting a national record. A year later in 1927 the college&#x27;s great musical tradition, the Choir of the West, was founded. The Choir acquired its name on a trip to the Great Lakes region.

Another merger occurred in 1929 when Spokane College, another Northwest Norwegian Lutheran school, closed. Its academic records were merged with PLC&#x27;s, and several of its faculty members came to PLC. In 1937 the university acquired the golf course through a generous donation. The same year the cornerstone was laid for the new library. 1939 saw the first of several visits by Norwegian royalty when Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha came to PLC&#x27;s campus.
During the early 1940s, PLC&#x27;s student body was almost all female as most men were fighting in World War II. People returning to college post-war, specifically veterans using the G.I. Bill, caused a boom in enrollment. The student body at that time was half veteran and no longer mostly female. A number of new buildings were completed in the following years including Ramstad Hall, Memorial Gymnasium, and the Student Union Building (now renamed as Anderson University Center). In 1952 the new Chapel-Music-Speech Building was constructed and later named Eastvold Chapel (renamed in 2013 as the Karen Hille Phillips Center for the Performing Arts). Chapel became mandatory for the first time with attendance being taken and seats being assigned. Two years later North and South Halls, the first dormitories, were built (later renamed Hong Hall and Hinderlie Hall, respectively.) Until that time students had lived in Old Main or boarded with Parkland families.

=== University status ===
Reclaiming the original name, Pacific Lutheran College became known as Pacific Lutheran University in 1960. Along with the name of the school being changed the PLU mascot was also changed from the Gladiators to the Knights. The 1960s saw decade-long construction boom as ten buildings were built by 1970, almost as many as had been built in the previous 70 years.

The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great change on PLU&#x27;s campus when restrictions on student life began to loosen. Chapel was no longer required and two dormitories become coed. Girls&#x27; dormitories&#x27; restrictive hours were replaced with a card-key system, and opposite-sex visitation was allowed 3 times a week instead of 2 times a year. Dancing was allowed for the first time on campus in 1963. Several well known entertainers performed at PLU including Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles, The Steve Miller Band, The Righteous Brothers, B.B. King, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, and Bob Hope.

Throughout its history PLU has remained close to its Scandinavian roots. In 1975 the school played host to King Olav V of Norway. Three years later in 1978, 14 members of Stortinget, the Norwegian Parliament, visited PLU. In 1982 King Carl XVI Gustav and Queen Silvia of Sweden visited PLU and the following year Princess Astrid of Norway also paid a visit to the university. That same year a monument was erected in Valle, Norway, to honor the Rev. Bjug Harstad, founder of PLU. By 1989 a Scandinavian Cultural Center would be completed on the lower floor of the University Center. King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway came to PLU in 1995 with Queen Sonja receiving an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. Crown Prince Haakon of Norway visited PLU in 1999. King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway visited PLU once again in the summer of 2015. To mark its 125th anniversary in 2015, PLU awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree to King Harald V of Norway.

===Presidents===
The first President of the Pacific Lutheran University was Rev. Bjug Harstad. The entire university was housed in one building from 1894 to 1912. This building was formerly known as Old Main but has since been renamed Harstad Hall in honor of the founding president.

The 14th and current president of the Pacific Lutheran University is L. Allan Belton, appointed in 2017.

===AAUP censure===
In June 2020, PLU was added to the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) list of censured administrations. An AAUP report found that a long-serving PLU faculty member had been dismissed in violation of the AAUP&#x27;s &quot;1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure&quot; allegedly in retaliation for engaging in labor union organizing activities.

===Reductions and reallocations===
In April 2021, the board of regents at PLU announced its approval for cuts to 36 full-time faculty equivalent (FTE) positions, which included some tenured faculty members losing their positions. The university also planned to discontinue two majors (German, Nordic Studies), four minors (Classical Studies, Norwegian, German), and one master&#x27;s program (Master of Science in Finance). The cuts also affected various programs in other ways. For example, some departments, including anthropology, lost so many faculty that they had to give up their majors. All cuts were planned to be implemented beginning with the fall 2022 semester. This was expected to save between $2.5 million and $4 million.

The cuts announced in April 2021 followed cuts of about 31 FTE faculty announced during the 2017–2018 academic year, with savings of around $2.8 million. Cuts announced in 2018 also affected some majors and minors. PLU had 376 faculty members in September 2017. More than 1 in 6 FTE faculty positions (67 positions) will have been eliminated as a result of the cuts announced in 2017-2018 and April 2021. The faculty cuts announced in 2017-2018 were made largely through attrition or enticing professors close to retirement to retire early, whereas the cuts announced in April 2021 involved more involuntary cuts, with some tenured and tenure-track and most contingent professors involuntarily losing their jobs.

== Admission and financial aid ==
Tuition for the 2019–20 school year was $43,264 with room and meals costing $10,876. More than 97 percent of PLU students received some sort of financial support. The 2020 U.S. News College and University rankings listed PLU as the seventh most innovative school, ninth best undergraduate teaching, and tenth best value school in the west region.

The 2019–2020 student body was as follows: 64 percent female, 36 percent male; 41 percent were students of color; 75 percent were from Washington state; 13 percent were Lutheran; 3 percent were international students representing 23 countries.

== Academics ==
The academic calendar at PLU is divided into two semesters, fall and spring, with a one-month term during January known as J-term. Summer classes are also offered. During J-term students take one class for the entire month of January which counts as a normal 4-credit class one would take during a semester. PLU offers 44 majors and 54 minors in a wide array of disciplines.

=== New American University ===
PLU is a member of The New American Colleges and Universities, a national consortium of 22 selective, medium-sized (2,000–7,500 students) independent colleges and universities dedicated to the purposeful integration of liberal education, professional studies, and civic engagement.

This type of institution was called a New American College by Ernest Boyer in a series of influential essays and speeches in the 1990s. Since Boyer coined this term, most of the institutions that have aligned with this identity are referred to as universities; so, the term has tended to become New American University.

===Study away===
In 2009, PLU received the Senator Paul Simon Award for Campus Internationalization. In the same year PLU matched a $1 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to create an endowment to assist low-income students to participate in study away programs. The Wang Center for International Programs opened in 2002 as the result of a $4 million donation from Peter, a 1960 PLU graduate, and Grace Wang. PLU maintains a partnership with Sichuan University, a university on the Entity List of the United States Department of Commerce&#x27;s Bureau of Industry and Security. Nearly 50% of PLU students study away.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.plu.edu/about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnerships ===
PLU has hosted a Confucius Institute since 2020 when it took over the Confucius Institute from the University of Washington.

==Campus==
The Pacific Lutheran University campus is located six miles (10 km) south of Tacoma, Washington, in suburban Parkland, on a 156-acre (63 ha) woodland campus. Joint Base Lewis-McChord is less than a half-mile (800 m) west of Parkland. The campus is unofficially divided into two sections, upper campus and lower campus.

Upper campus is home to many of the academic and administration buildings including the Phillip Hauge Administration Building, Mortvedt Library, Ramstad Hall and Xavier Hall. In 1964, the Board of Regents engaged Richard Haag—&#x27;the father of Northwest Landscape Architecture&#x27;—to design the landscape architecture plan for upper campus. Haag is famous for his work on Gas Works Park in Seattle, Washington and on the Bloedel Reserve on Bainbridge Island as well as the Seattle Center.

The Mortvedt Library offers over 260,000 volumes of books as well as over 23,000 full-text journals. The oldest book in the PLU collection is a psalter by Johann Bugenhagen published in 1524. Built in 1937, Xavier Hall served as the library until the Mortvedt Library was built in 1967. Since then the Division of Social Sciences has been housed in Xavier. In 2000 Xavier underwent a $5 million renovation project that saw the addition of the Philip Nordquist Lecture Hall. The Anderson University Center is also located on upper campus. This building houses the all-campus cafeteria, called The Commons, and the Old Main Market convenience store. In addition it houses the offices of Campus Ministry, Student Involvement and Leadership, Residential Life, the Diversity Center, the Scandinavian Center, Student Media, Residence Hall Association, the Associated Students of PLU (ASPLU), Hospitality and Dining Services, and the Chris Knutzen Lecture Hall.

Along with the academic and administration buildings upper campus also houses PLU&#x27;s art programs. The Mary Baker Russell Music Center was built in 1997 and is the home of PLU&#x27;s Department of Music. The acoustically impressive and well-known Lagerquist Concert Hall houses the Gottfried and Mary Fuchs Organ (the largest University-based mechanical action organ on the West Coast) as well as state-of-the-art practice and performance facilities. Ingram Hall is home to a communication computer lab, a digital photography/graphic design lab, and studio art classrooms for painting, ceramics, sculpture, photography and printmaking. Ingram boasts two galleries: the University Gallery (which houses major shows and exhibitions) and the Wekell Gallery (which generally houses student and class work). Eastvold Auditorium, formal called Eastvold Chapel, seats 1100 and is the home of PLU Theatre. Eastvold hosts all main stage productions as well as a range of smaller productions throughout the year. In October 2011, PLU Theatre premiered a new addition to its arts department, the Karen H. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Named after the former Regent, this space is a symbol of the completion of phase one in Eastvold Auditorium&#x27;s renovations. Eastvold is set to reopen with a new performing arts center in the fall of 2013.

Lower campus is home to many of the university&#x27;s athletic facilities. These include Olson Auditorium, Memorial Gymnasium, Names Fitness Center, and the university swimming pool. Also located on lower campus are the Rieke Science Center, Morken Center for Learning and Technology, Martin J. Neeb Building, and the Keck Observatory.

Additional buildings around the perimeter of campus are also used for University purposes, including offices, the Wang Center for International Studies, East Campus, the Women&#x27;s Center, the University House and Trinity Lutheran Church.

===Residential life===
PLU requires that all students under 20 years of age or junior status on or before September 1 live on campus or at home with a parent, spouse or child. Approximately half of all students enrolled at PLU live on campus. There are ten residence halls at PLU, with six located on upper campus and four located on lower campus.

Every year, the PLU Football team helps move new students into their PLU home.

The ten on campus residence halls: 
* Harstad Hall, built in 1894, is the oldest building on campus and housed the entire university from 1894 to 1912. It became a residence hall in 1960. It is an all-female hall, the only single sex hall on campus. Harstad is five stories tall and houses approximately 200 female residents. In 1984 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
* Hinderlie Hall, built in 1954, Hinderlie Hall was first named South Hall but changed to Hinderlie in 1966 in honor of Berent and Ragna Hinderlie, university staff members between 1923 and 1955. The hall is four stories tall, with resident rooms on each floor including the south side of the basement, which is open to the hillside. Approximately 130 residents reside in Hinderlie.
* Hong International Hall, built in 1954, was originally named North Hall. In 1966 the building was renamed in honor of Nils Joseph Hong, president from 1898 until 1918 and a faculty member at Pacific Lutheran College until he retired in 1938. The hall has five language wings (Norwegian, Chinese, French, German, and Spanish) and the International Honors wing. Approximately 75 residents reside in Hong.
* Kreidler Hall, built in 1957, was originally named West Hall. In 1966 the hall was renamed Kreidler Hall after Lora Bradford Kreidler, the Dean of Women and teacher of arts from 1921 to 1943. All rooms in Kreidler are single rooms and students must be 20 years of age or junior standing to reside in Kreidler. Approximately 65 students reside in Kreidler.
* Stuen Hall, built in 1966, is named after Ole J. Stuen, faculty member and administrator from 1913 to 1952. Approximately 100 residents reside in Stuen.
* Ordal Hall, built in 1967, is named in honor of Ola J. Ordal, president of Pacific Lutheran College from 1921 to 1928. The Hall was originally built to house 187 female students but has since become co-ed.
* Pflueger Hall, built in 1962, was the first residence hall built on lower campus. The building is named after Jesse P. Pflueger, professor of religion and philosophy from 1930 to 1958. It was designed to be a three-story hall to house 212 men, but since then has been converted to house both men and women.
* Foss Hall, built in 1965, is named after Rev. Halfdan L. Foss, chairman of the Pacific Lutheran Board of Trustees from 1942 to 1964. The hall originally housed 188 men but has since become co-ed. It was taken offline after Spring 2015.
* Tingelstad Hall, built in 1967, was originally designed to house 396 men but has since then become co-ed. The hall was named to honor Oscar A. Tingelstad, president of Pacific Lutheran College from 1928 to 1943. Standing nine stories tall Tingelstad is the tallest building in Parkland. The hall is divided into four houses, Alpine, Cascade, Evergreen and Ivy with every two floors sharing a common lounge.
* South Hall, built in 2000, is an apartment-style complex located on the south edge of campus. Students must be 20-years of age or junior standing to reside in South.

===Commitment to sustainability===
PLU has a long history of being committed to a sustainable campus and leading the way as an example for institutions around the world. A certification program in environmental studies was developed in the 1970s, and a major was established in the 1990s. On April 22, 2004, PLU President Loren Anderson signed the Talloires Declaration, making PLU the first Pacific Northwest University to sign the declaration. Leading the nation as a charter signatory to the American College and University presidents Climate Commitment in 2007, PLU accepted the challenge, showing commitment to achieving carbon neutrality. The agreement called for universities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but PLU has taken the initiative to set their goal of becoming carbon neutral by December 31, 2020. The 2015 edition of The Princeton Review&#x27;s Guide to 353 Green Colleges recognized PLU as a green college leader. Highlights of the review include PLU dining services using 25 percent of its food budget to buy local and/or organic food and 95 percent of the products used by the cleaning services crew being Green Seal Certified.
PLU is currently in the process of remodeling and reconstructing multiple buildings throughout campus. The goal is for each building to obtain a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating of Gold. Currently two buildings have been awarded a Gold rating by LEED. In 2006 the Morken Center for Learning and Technology became the first building to earn the award. The Morken Building is home to the School of Business and the Computer Science department. This , $21 million building requires no fossil fuel to operate and is heated and cooled by using a geothermal heat-pump system that regulates its temperature with water stored in 85 wells located 300 feet (100 m) underground. In 2009 a second building would earn the LEED Gold rating when the Martin J. Neeb Center was completed. This building was home to the radio station 88.5 KPLU and at the time of the award being presented it was the only radio facility in the nation with a LEED Gold ranking. The University Center was the third building to receive a LEED rating. Following the completion of the 2006–2007 academic year, the University Center underwent $14 million in construction renovations and as a result earned a LEED Silver rating.

As of 2013, PLU diverted more than 70% of its waste. For its record on sustainability, the university was recognized with a Gold Award from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). In 2008, a student-led initiative brought awareness about saving money by consuming tap water instead of buying bottled water. Bottled water is not sold in campus restaurants as a result of the student-run initiative in 2011. All of the programs in the PLU Sustainability Office are student-led i.e. Bike Coop, Community Garden, surPLUs store, and habitat restoration.

==Student activities==

===Music===
PLU&#x27;s instrumental groups include the University Symphony Orchestra, Wind Ensemble, Concert Band, Jazz Ensemble, Jazz Combo, and Chamber Music. Along with these groups the university has a variety of vocal groups which include the Choir of the West, University Chorale, University Singers, University Men&#x27;s Chorus, Choral Union, and Chapel Choir.

===&quot;The Mast&quot;===
&quot;The Mast&quot; is PLU&#x27;s student-run newspaper. It was first printed in 1924 in the basement of the university chapel. It is now a converged media group which includes Mast TV and Lute Air Student Radio. It was originally named &quot;The Mooring Mast&quot;, but was changed in Fall 2015 to simply &quot;The Mast.&quot; The unusual, original name &quot;The Mooring Mast&quot; came from the USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, a U.S. Navy airship. In nearby Fort Lewis there was a large mooring structure for the airship and the students derived the name from this in honor of the famed ship.

===Army ROTC===
PLU has a US Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) detachment that each year commissions officers into the active Army, Army National Guard and Army Reserve. In addition to Army scholarships, PLU provides a room and board scholarship. The Lute Battalion of Army ROTC won the McArthur Award—the highest award available—in 2010, 2012 and 2013.

==KPLU-FM==

KPLU-FM (88.5 MHz) is a news and jazz format National Public Radio member station that was owned by Pacific Lutheran University. While PLU held the license for the radio station and all KPLU staff members were also university employees, the university took a hands-off approach to on-air content. PLU supported the station with infrastructure amounting to more than $1.5 million annually.

=== Sale of KPLU ===
On November 12, 2015, it was announced to KPLU staff that PLU intended to sell the radio station to the University of Washington, which already operated KUOW. On May 26, 2016, Friends of 88.5 FM announced that they had raised $7 million to match the offer made by the University of Washington. On June 28, 2016, PLU announced that it had reached an agreement to transfer the license for 88.5 FM to Friends of 88.5 FM. The sale was consummated on August 30, 2016.

==Athletics==
PLU is a member of National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III, as well as the Northwest Conference. PLU has a rich tradition of athletic success: in the Northwest Conference, no other school has won the All-Sports Trophy as many times as PLU has. In 2014, PLU was honored as first recipient of Diversity Spotlight award for LGBTQ inclusion efforts by student-athletes.

PLU offers the following varsity sports: Baseball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Basketball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Cross Country, Football, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Golf, Women&#x27;s Rowing, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Soccer, Softball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Swimming, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Tennis, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Track and field, and Women&#x27;s Volleyball. Along with these varsity sports PLU also offers Men&#x27;s Rowing, both Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Lacrosse and Ultimate Frisbee as club sports.

==Traditions==

<doc id="226740" wikidata="Q348679" url="?curid=226740" title="Stachys the Apostle">
<text>Stachys the Apostle (Greek: Στάχυς, &quot;ear-spike&quot;; died 54) was the second bishop of Byzantium, from 38 to 54 AD according to tradition.

Stachys is mentioned just one time in the New Testament as a person loved by Paul the Apostle (Romans 16:9). Other than that, all information regarding him comes from tradition. He seemed to be closely connected to Andrew the Apostle and Paul the Apostle. Eusebius quotes Origen as saying that Andrew had preached in Asia Minor and in Scythia, along the Black Sea as far as the Volga and Kiev, hence he became a patron saint of Romania and Russia. According to tradition, Saint Andrew founded the See of Byzantium in 38, installing Stachys as bishop, a position he held for sixteen years. 

This See would later develop into the Patriarchate of Constantinople, having Apostle Andrew as its Patron Saint. Stachys founded a church at Argyropouli, and many people gathered there to hear him preach. 

It is not clear if Stachys was the same person whom Paul calls &quot;dear&quot; in the &quot;Epistle to the Romans&quot; (Rom. 16:9), but he is always associated in traditions with five other apostles (Ampliatus, Urban of Macedonia, Apelles of Heraklion, Aristobulus of Britannia and Narcissus of Athens) that are the very same names mentioned together with him by Paul in .

His feast day is on 31 October.

<doc id="226741" wikidata="Q5327160" url="?curid=226741" title="Earth in science fiction">
<text>The overwhelming majority of fiction is set on or features the Earth, as the only planet home to humans or known to have life. This also holds true of science fiction, despite perceptions to the contrary. Works that focus specifically on Earth may do so holistically, treating the planet as one semi-biological entity. Counterfactual depictions of the shape of the Earth, be it flat or hollow, are occasionally featured. A personified, living Earth appears in a handful of works. In works set in the far future, Earth can be a center of space-faring human civilization, or just one of many inhabited planets of a galactic empire, and sometimes destroyed by ecological disaster or nuclear war or otherwise forgotten or lost.

== Related vocabulary ==

In a number of works of science fiction, Earth&#x27;s English name has become less popular, and the planet is instead known as Terra or Tellus, Latin words for Earth. Inhabitants of Earth can be referred to as Earthlings, Earthers, Earthborn, Earthfolk, Earthians, Earthies (this term being often seen as derogatory), Earthmen (and Earthwomen), Earthpersons, Earthsiders, Solarians, Tellurians, Terrestrials, Terrestrians, or Terrans.

In addition, science fiction vocabulary includes terms like Earthfall for landing of a spaceship on planet Earth; or Earth-type, Earthlike, Earthnorm(al) and terrestrial for the concept of &quot;resembling planet Earth or conditions on it&quot;.

The concept of modifying planets to be more Earth-like is known as terraforming. The concept of terraforming developed from both science fiction and actual science. In science, Carl Sagan, an astronomer, proposed the terraforming of Venus in 1961, which is considered one of the first accounts of the concept. The term itself, however, was coined by Jack Williamson in a science-fiction short story (&quot;Collision Orbit&quot;) published in 1942 in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, although the concept of terraforming in popular culture predates this work; for example, the idea of turning the Moon into a habitable environment with atmosphere was already present in &quot;La Journée d&#x27;un Parisien au XXIe siècle&quot; (&quot;A Day of a Parisian in the 21st Century&quot;, 1910) by . 

== Themes ==
In general, the vast majority of fiction, including science fiction, takes place on Earth. To the extent that Earth is more than the obvious but forgettable background where the action of the story takes place, a number of themes have been identified.

=== Earth ===
Many works of science fiction focus on the outer space, but many others still take place on Earth; this distinction has been subject to debates among the science fiction authors, visible for example in J. G. Ballard&#x27;s 1962 essay &quot;Which Way to Inner Space?&quot;. Some critics of the &quot;outer space adventures&quot; have pointed to the importance of &quot;earthly&quot; concepts and imagery closer to contemporary readers&#x27; everyday experience. While it has been argued that a planet can be considered &quot;too large, and its lifetime too long, to be comfortably accommodated within fiction as a topic in its own right,&quot; this has not prevented some writers from engaging with said topic. 

Some works that focus on Earth as an entity have been influenced by holistic, &quot;big picture&quot; concepts such as the Gaia hypothesis, noosphere and the Omega Point, and the popularizing of the photography of Earth from space. Others works have addressed the concept of Earth as a Goddess Gaia (from Greek mythology; another prominent goddess of Earth whose name influenced science fiction was the Roman Terra or Tellus). Bridging these ideas, and treating Earth as a semi-biological or even sentient entity, are classic works like Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;When the World Screamed&quot; (1928) and Jack Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Born of the Sun&quot; (1934).

===Shape===

Depictions of the Earth as being flat are uncommon in modern works, the sphericity of the planet having been proved around 200 B.C. by Archimedes and Eratosthenes. Exceptions to this include Terry Pratchett&#x27;s satirical &quot;Discworld&quot; series—which was inspired by Hindu cosmology—and deliberately provocative works like S. Fowler Wright&#x27;s novel &quot;Beyond the Rim&quot; from 1932. There have also been fictional accounts of a hollow Earth, such as Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s 1838 novel &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; inspired by John Cleves Symmes Jr.&#x27;s model featuring openings at the north and south poles whereby the interior can be accessed. A few writers have likewise engaged with another old fringe theory, that of Counter-Earth – a hypothetical body of the Solar System that orbits on the other side of the solar system from Earth.

Many stories portray Earth as known to modern science, but the exploration of its subterrean depths, relatively consistent with the knowledge of modern geology, is still subject to a number of works. Brian Stableford listed among &quot;notable accounts of burrowing expeditions&quot; into such an Earth works such as Harry Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Rock Diver&quot; (1951).

===Planetary engineering===
Large scale planetary engineering includes ideas such as adjusting the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt, or moving the Earth from its orbit. Some works deal with geoengineering, a term usually referred to large-scale projects attempting to deal with the problem of climate change; a theme common in many works of climate fiction. In the extreme case, Earth can be consumed in its entirety, all of its mass repurposed in construction of megastructures such as a Dyson sphere.
=== The end of Earth ===
Various versions of the future of Earth have been imagined. Some works focus on the end of the planet; those have been written in all forms – some focused on &quot;ostentatious mourning&quot;; others more of a slapstick comedy; yet others take this opportunity to explore themes of astronomy or sociology. The genre of climate fiction can often mix the themes of near and far future consequences of the climate change, whether anthropogenic or accidental. In other works, often found in the apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction and the Dying Earth genres, Earth has been destroyed or at least ruined for generations to come; many such works are therefore set in the background of Earth changed into a wasteland. Some of the works in these genres overlap with the climate change genre, as climate change and resulting ecological disasters are a commonly used plot device for events that trigger the fall of human civilization (other plots involve the destruction of Earth from human warfare, alien invasions, or from various sorts of man-made incidents or accidental disasters). Many such works, set either during the disaster, or in its aftermath, are metaphors for environmental concerns or otherwise warnings about issues the writers think humanity needs to be concerned about.

=== One planet among many ===
For many works set in the far future, Earth is just one of many inhabited planets of a galactic empire, federation or larger civilization, and many similar planets have been found or created (common themes in space opera), all of which challenges the idea of Earth&#x27;s uniqueness. In some works, Earth is still a center of the known universe, or at least a significant player on the galactic scene. In others, Earth has become of so little importance that it is a mostly forgotten backwards world. In Clifford D. Simak&#x27;s &quot;Cemetery World&quot; (1973) Earth is a planet-size cemetery and in Gordon R. Dickson&#x27;s &quot;Call Him Lord&quot; (1966), a museum. At its extreme, in some settings, knowledge of Earth has been simply lost, making it a mythological place, whose existence is questioned by the few who even know the legends about it. In some of these works, a major plotline can involve future civilizations or intrepid explorers seeking the &quot;lost cradle&quot; or Earth. Finally, some stories told from the perspective of aliens focus on their discovery of Earth.

===A different history===
Some works look backwards – or perhaps sideways, not to the future of Earth, but to its past; here, works of science fiction can overlap with historic fiction as well as prehistoric fiction. This can happen particularly through the genres of alternate history as well as time travel (where as Gary Westfahl observed, most time travellers travel through time much more than space, visiting the past or future versions of Earth).

<doc id="226748" wikidata="Q745832" url="?curid=226748" title="Stillbirth">
<text>Stillbirth is typically defined as fetal death at or after 20 or 28 weeks of pregnancy, depending on the source. It results in a baby born without signs of life. A stillbirth can often result in the feeling of guilt or grief in the mother. The term is in contrast to miscarriage, which is an early pregnancy loss, and sudden infant death syndrome, where the baby dies a short time after being born alive.
Often the cause is unknown. Causes may include pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and birth complications, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord, birth defects, infections such as malaria and syphilis, and poor health in the mother. Risk factors include a mother&#x27;s age over 35, smoking, drug use, use of assisted reproductive technology, and first pregnancy. Stillbirth may be suspected when no fetal movement is felt. Confirmation is by ultrasound.
Worldwide prevention of most stillbirths is possible with improved health systems. Around half of stillbirths occur during childbirth, with this being more common in the developing than developed world. Otherwise, depending on how far along the pregnancy is, medications may be used to start labor or a type of surgery known as dilation and evacuation may be carried out. Following a stillbirth, women are at higher risk of another one; however, most subsequent pregnancies do not have similar problems. Depression, financial loss, and family breakdown are known complications.
Worldwide in 2021, there were an estimated 1.9 million stillbirths that occurred after 28 weeks of pregnancy (about 1 for every 72 births). More than three-quarters of estimated stillbirths in 2021 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with 47% of the global total in sub-Saharan Africa and 32% in South Asia. Stillbirth rates have declined, though more slowly since the 2000s. According to UNICEF, the total number of stillbirths declined by 35%, from 2.9 million in 2000 to 1.9 million in 2021. It is estimated that if the stillbirth rate for each country stays at the 2021 level, 17,5 million babies will be stillborn by 2030.
==Causes==
As of 2016, there is no international classification system for stillbirth causes. The causes of a large percentage of stillbirths is unknown, even in cases where extensive testing and an autopsy have been performed. A rarely used term to describe these is &quot;sudden antenatal death syndrome&quot;, or SADS, a phrase coined in 2000. Many stillbirths occur at full term to apparently healthy pregnant women, and a postmortem evaluation reveals a cause of death in about 40% of autopsied cases.

About 10% of cases are believed to be due to obesity, high blood pressure, or diabetes.

Other risk factors include:
* bacterial infection, like syphilis
* malaria
* birth defects, especially pulmonary hypoplasia
* chromosomal aberrations
* growth restriction
* intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy
* maternal diabetes
* maternal consumption of recreational drugs (such as alcohol, nicotine, etc.) or pharmaceutical drugs contraindicated in pregnancy
* postdate pregnancy
* placental abruptions
* physical trauma
* radiation poisoning
* Rh disease
* celiac disease
* female genital mutilation

* umbilical cord accidents
** &quot;Prolapsed umbilical cord&quot; – Prolapse of the umbilical cord happens when the foetus is not in a correct position in the pelvis. Membranes rupture and the cord is pushed out through the cervix. When the fetus pushes on the cervix, the cord is compressed and blocks blood and oxygen flow to the fetus. The pregnant woman has approximately 10 minutes to get to a doctor before there is any harm done to the fetus.
** &quot;Monoamniotic twins&quot; – These twins share the same placenta and the same amniotic sac and therefore can interfere with each other&#x27;s umbilical cords. When entanglement of the cords is detected, it is highly recommended to deliver the foetuses as early as 31 weeks.
** &quot;Umbilical cord length&quot; – A short umbilical cord (&lt;30 cm) can affect the foetus in that foetal movements can cause cord compression, constriction, and rupture. A long umbilical cord (&gt;72 cm) can affect the foetus depending on the way the foetus interacts with the cord. Some foetuses grasp the umbilical cord but it is yet unknown as to whether a foetus is strong enough to compress and stop blood flow through the cord. Also, an active foetus, one that frequently repositions itself in the uterus can accidentally entangle itself with the cord. A hyperactive foetus should be evaluated with ultrasound to rule out cord entanglement.
** &quot;Cord entanglement&quot; – The umbilical cord can wrap around an extremity, the body or the neck of the foetus. When the cord is wrapped around the neck of the fetus, it is called a nuchal cord. These entanglements can cause constriction of blood flow to the fetus. These entanglements can be visualized with ultrasound.
** &quot;Torsion&quot; – This term refers to the twisting of the umbilical around itself. Torsion of the umbilical cord is very common (especially in equine stillbirths) but it is not a natural state of the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord can be untwisted at delivery. The average cord has three twists.
* Smoke inhalation – If a pregnant woman gets trapped in a building fire, the smoke and fumes can kill a foetus.

A pregnant woman sleeping on her back after 28 weeks of pregnancy may be a risk factor for stillbirth.

After a stillbirth there is a 2.5% risk of another stillbirth in the next pregnancy (an increase from 0.4%).

In the United States, highest rates of stillbirths happen in pregnant women who:
* are of low socioeconomic status
* are aged 35 years or older
* have chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc.
* are African-American
* have previously lost a pregnancy
* have multiple children at a time (twins, triplets, etc.)

==Diagnosis==
It is unknown how much time is needed for a fetus to die. Fetal behavior is consistent and a change in the fetus&#x27; movements or sleep-wake cycles can indicate fetal distress. A decrease or cessation in sensations of fetal activity may be an indication of fetal distress or death, Still, medical examination, including a nonstress test, is recommended in the event of any type of any change in the strength or frequency of fetal movement, especially a complete cease; most midwives and obstetricians recommend the use of a kick chart to assist in detecting any changes. Fetal distress or death can be confirmed or ruled out via fetoscopy/doptone, ultrasound, and/or electronic fetal monitoring. If the fetus is alive but inactive, extra attention will be given to the placenta and umbilical cord during ultrasound examination to ensure that there is no compromise of oxygen and nutrient delivery.

Some researchers have tried to develop models to identify, early on, pregnant women who may be at high risk of having a stillbirth.

===Definition===
There are a number of definitions for stillbirth. To allow comparison, the World Health Organization uses the ICD-10 definitions and recommends that any baby born without signs of life at greater than or equal to 28 completed weeks&#x27; gestation be classified as a stillbirth. The WHO uses the ICD-10 definitions of &quot;late fetal deaths&quot; as their definition of stillbirth. Other organisations recommend that any combination of greater than 16, 20, 22, 24 or 28 weeks gestational age or 350 g, 400 g, 500 g or 1000 g birth weight may be considered a stillbirth.

The term is often used in distinction to live birth (the baby was born alive, even if they died shortly thereafter) or miscarriage (early pregnancy loss). The word miscarriage is often used incorrectly to describe stillbirths. The term is mostly used in a human context; however, the same phenomenon can occur in all species of placental mammals.

===Constricted umbilical cord===
When the umbilical cord is constricted (q.v. &quot;accidents&quot; above), the fetus experiences periods of hypoxia, and may respond by unusually high periods of kicking or struggling, to free the umbilical cord. These are sporadic if constriction is due to a change in the fetus&#x27; or mother&#x27;s position, and may become worse or more frequent as the fetus grows. Extra attention should be given if mothers experience large increases in kicking from previous childbirths, especially when increases correspond to position changes.

Regulating high blood pressure, diabetes and drug use may reduce the risk of a stillbirth. Umbilical cord constriction may be identified and observed by ultrasound, if requested.

Some maternal factors are associated with stillbirth, including being age 35 or older, having diabetes, having a history of addiction to illegal drugs, being overweight or obese, and smoking cigarettes in the three months before getting pregnant.

==Treatment==

Fetal death &quot;in utero&quot; does not present an immediate health risk to the pregnant woman, and labour will usually begin spontaneously after two weeks, so the pregnant woman may choose to wait and bear the fetal remains vaginally. After two weeks, the pregnant woman is at risk of developing blood clotting problems, and labor induction is recommended at this point. In many cases, the pregnant woman will find the idea of carrying the dead fetus traumatizing and will elect to have labor induced. Caesarean birth is not recommended unless complications develop during vaginal birth. How the diagnosis of stillbirth is communicated by healthcare workers may have a long-lasting and deep impact on parents. People need to heal physically after a stillbirth just as they do emotionally. In Ireland, for example, people are offered a &#x27;cuddle cot&#x27;, a cooled cot which allows them to spend a number of days with their child before burial or cremation.

==Delivery==
In single stillbirths, common practice is to induce labor for the health of the mother due to possible complications such as exsanguination. Induction and labor can take 48 hours. In the case of various complications such as preclampsia, infections, multiples (twins), emergency Cesarean may occur.

==Epidemiology==
The average stillbirth rate in the United States is approximately 1 in 160 births, which is roughly 26,000 stillbirths each year. In Australia, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the rate is approximately 1 in every 200 births; in Scotland, 1 in 167. Rates of stillbirth in the United States have decreased by about two-thirds since the 1950s.

The vast majority of stillbirths worldwide (98%) occur in low- and middle-income countries, where medical care can be of low quality or unavailable. Reliable estimates calculate that, yearly, about 2.6 million stillbirths occur worldwide during the third trimester. Stillbirths were previously not included in the Global Burden of Disease Study which records worldwide deaths from various causes until 2015.

==Society and culture==
The way people view stillbirths has changed dramatically over time; however, its economic and psychosocial impact is often underestimated. In the early 20th century, when a stillbirth occurred, the baby was taken and discarded and the parents were expected to immediately let go of the attachment and try for another baby. In many countries, parents are expected by friends and family members to recover from the loss of an unborn baby very soon after it happens. Societally-mediated complications such as financial hardship and depression are among the more common results. A stillbirth can have significant psychological effects on the parents, notably causing feelings of guilt in the mother. Further psycho-social effects on parents include apprehension, anger, feelings of worthlessness and not wanting to interact with other people, with these reactions sometimes carried over into pregnancies that occur after the stillbirth. Men also suffer psychologically after stillbirth, although they are more likely to hide their grief and feelings and try to act strong, with the focus on supporting their partner.

===Legal definitions===
====Australia====
In Australia, stillbirth is defined as a baby born with no signs of life that weighs more than 400 grams, or more than 20 weeks in gestation. They legally must have their birth registered.

====Austria====
In Austria, a stillbirth is defined as a birth of a child of at least 500g weight without vital signs, e.g. blood circulation, breath or muscle movements.

====Canada====
Beginning in 1959, &quot;the definition of a stillbirth was revised to conform, in substance, to the definition of fetal death recommended by the World Health Organization&quot;. The definition of &quot;fetal death&quot; promulgated by the World Health Organization in 1950 is as follows:
:&quot;Fetal death&quot; means death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy and which is not an induced termination of pregnancy. The death is indicated by the fact that after such expulsion or extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Heartbeats are to be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions; respirations are to be distinguished from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps.

====Germany====

In Germany, a stillbirth is defined as the birth of a child of at least 500g weight without blood circulation or breath. Details for burial vary amongst the federal states.

====Ireland====

Since 1 January 1995, stillbirths occurring in Ireland must be registered; stillbirths that occurred before that date can also be registered but evidence is required. For the purposes of civil registration, s.1 of the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994 refers to &quot;...a child weighing at least 500 grammes, or having reached a gestational age of at least 24 weeks who shows no signs of life.&quot;

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, stillbirth is defined differently by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) and the Dutch Perinatal Registry (Stichting PRN). The birth and mortality numbers from the CBS include all livebirths, regardless of gestational duration, and all stillbirths from 24 weeks of gestation and onwards. In the Perinatal Registry, gestational duration of both liveborn and stillborn children is available. They register all liveborn and stillborn children from 22, 24 or 28 weeks of gestation and onwards (dependent on the report: fetal, neonatal or perinatal mortality). Therefore, data from these institutions on (still)births cannot be compared simply one-on-one.

====United Kingdom====
The registration of stillbirths has been required in England and Wales from 1927 and in Scotland from 1939 but is not required in Northern Ireland. Sometimes a pregnancy is terminated deliberately during a late phase, for example due to congenital anomaly. UK law requires these procedures to be registered as &quot;stillbirths&quot;.

=====England and Wales=====
For the purposes of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1926 (as amended), section 12 contains the definition:A similar definition is applied within the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 (as amended), contained in s.41.

The above definitions apply within those Acts thus other legislation will not necessarily be in identical terms.

s.2 of the 1953 Act requires that registration of a birth takes place within 42 days of the birth except where an inquest takes place or the child has been &quot;found exposed&quot; in which latter case the time limit runs from the time of finding.

Extracts from the register of stillbirths are restricted to those who have obtained consent from the Registrar General for England and Wales.

=====Scotland=====
Section 56(1) of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965 (as amended) contains the definition:s.21(1) of the same Act requires that:In the general case, s.14 of the Act requires that a birth has to be registered within 21 days of the birth or of the child being found.

Unlike the registers for births, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths, the register of still-births is not open to public access and issue of extracts requires the permission of the Registrar General for Scotland.

=====Northern Ireland=====
In Northern Ireland, the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, as amended contains the definition:Registration of stillbirths can be made by a relative or certain other persons involved with the stillbirth but it is not compulsory to do so. Registration takes place with the District Registrar for the Registration District where the still-birth occurred or for the District in which the mother is resident. A stillbirth certificate will be issued to the registrant with further copies only available to those obtaining official consent for their issue. Registration may be made within three months of the still-birth.

====United States====
In the United States, there is no standard definition of the term &#x27;stillbirth&#x27;.

In the U.S., the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 specifies that any breathing, heartbeat, pulsating umbilical cord or confirmed voluntary muscle movement indicate live birth rather than stillbirth.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects statistical information on &quot;live births, fetal deaths, and induced termination of pregnancy&quot; from 57 reporting areas in the United States. Each reporting area has different guidelines and definitions for what is being reported; many do not use the term &quot;stillbirth&quot; at all. The federal guidelines suggest (at page 1) that fetal death and stillbirth can be interchangeable terms. The CDC definition of &quot;fetal death&quot; is based on the definition promulgated by the World Health Organization in 1950 (see section above on Canada). Researchers are learning more about the long term psychiatric sequelae of traumatic birth and believe the effects may be intergenerational

The CDC states that, in the US, a stillbirth is typically defined as the loss of a fetus during or after the 20th week of pregnancy. Stillbirths can further be classified as early (occurring between week 20 and week 27 of pregnancy), late (occurring between week 28 and week 36 of pregnancy), and term (occurring during or after week 37 of pregnancy). In the US, approximately 21,000 babies are stillborn annually, and stillbirth affects around 1 in 175 births.

The federal guidelines recommend reporting those fetal deaths whose birth weight is over 12.5 oz (350 g), or those more than 20 weeks gestation. Forty-one areas use a definition very similar to the federal definition, thirteen areas use a shortened definition of fetal death, and three areas have no formal definition of fetal death. Only 11 areas specifically use the term &#x27;stillbirth&#x27;, often synonymously with late fetal death; however, they are split between whether stillbirths are &quot;irrespective of the duration of pregnancy&quot;, or whether some age or weight constraint is applied. A movement in the U.S. has changed the way that stillbirths are documented through vital records. Previously, only the deaths were reported. However, 27 states have enacted legislation that offers some variation of a birth certificate as an option for parents who choose to pay for one. Parents may not claim a tax exemption for stillborn infants, even if a birth certificate is offered. To claim an exemption, the birth must be certified as live, even if the infant only lives for a very brief period.

After &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, some states restricted women&#x27;s access to abortion, even when the pregnancy is nonviable. Legal restrictions on medications and procedures that have been used for abortions may also impact treatment options for women undergoing a miscarriage or stillbirth.

<doc id="226751" wikidata="Q1139211" url="?curid=226751" title="Kerning">
<text>In typography, kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a visually pleasing result. Kerning adjusts the space between individual letterforms while tracking (letter-spacing) adjusts spacing uniformly over a range of characters. In a well-kerned font, the two-dimensional blank spaces between each pair of characters all have a visually similar area. The term &quot;keming&quot; is sometimes used informally to refer to poor kerning (the letters &quot;r&quot; and &quot;n&quot; placed too closely together being easily mistaken for the letter &quot;m&quot;).

The related term kern denotes a part of a typed letter that overhangs the edge of the type block.

== Metal typesetting ==

The source of the word &quot;kern&quot; is from the French word , meaning &quot;projecting angle, quill of a pen&quot;. The French term originated from the Latin , , meaning &quot;hinge&quot;. In the days when all type was cast metal, the parts of a typecasting sort that needed to overlap adjacent letters hung off the sort slug&#x27;s edge. Those overhanging metal pieces were called kerns. At that time, the word &quot;kerning&quot; only referred to manufacturing the sorts with kerns, while adjusting space between letters during compositing was called inter-spacing or letter spacing.

Because this method was not well suited to some pairs of letters, ligatures were supplied for those glyph combinations, such as the French , or the combinations &quot;ff&quot;, &quot;fi&quot;, &quot;fl&quot;, &quot;ffi&quot;, &quot;ffl&quot;, and others.

==Digital typography==
In metal typesetting, kerning was labor-intensive and expensive because the matrices had to be physically modified. It was therefore only employed on letter combinations that needed it the most, such as &quot;VA&quot; or &quot;AV&quot;. With the arrival of digital fonts, it became much easier to kern many glyph combinations.

===Kerning values===
In digital typography, kerning is usually applied to letter pairs as a number by which the default character spacing should be increased or decreased: a positive value for an increase, a negative value for a decrease. The number is expressed in &quot;font units&quot;, one unit being a certain fraction of an &quot;em&quot; (one em is the type size currently used). Different fonts may use other units, but common values are 1000 and 2048 units/em. Thus, for 1000 units/em, a kerning value of 15 means an increase in character spacing by 0.015 of the current type size. (The kerning units for a given font are the same as the units used to express the character widths in that font.)

Most kerning adjustments are negative, and negative adjustments are generally larger than positive ones. Adjustments for different pairs within a given font can range from a tiny 2 to over 100 (when expressed as 1000 units/em). The adjustments for a given pair vary greatly from one font to another.

Negative kerning is widely used to fit capital letters such as &quot;T&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot; closer to some other capital letters on either side, especially &quot;A&quot;, and to some lower case letters on the right side, such as the combinations &quot;Ta&quot;, &quot;Te&quot;, and &quot;To&quot;. It is also used to fit a period (full stop) or a comma closer to these and to &quot;F&quot; and &quot;P&quot; and the lowercase letters &quot;r&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, and &quot;y&quot;. Some other combinations that use negative kerning are &quot;FA&quot;, &quot;LT&quot;, and &quot;LY&quot;, and letters like &quot;A&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, and &quot;h&quot; followed by a quotation mark.

Positive kerning is used mainly in conjunction with special characters and punctuation (for example, the lower case letter &quot;f&quot; followed by right parenthesis or quotation mark). Depending on the font, some small positive kerning may also be required for accented letters and pairs like &quot;Bo&quot;, &quot;Dw&quot;, and &quot;TY&quot;.

The table below contains a few exemplifying kerning pairs and their values. These values are based on 1000 units/em and the kerning pairs are ordered from the most negative to the most positive kerning value. The samples are taken from the kerning tables of the Minion Pro font. In other fonts the kerning may be very different.

Which letters need to be kerned depends on which language the font is to be used with. Since some combinations of letters are not used in normal words in any language, kerning these is not necessary. Non-proportional (monospaced) fonts do not use kerning, since their characters always have the same spacing.

===Kerning tables===
In older font formats, such as Microsoft&#x27;s TrueType, the kerning values are specified in a simple &quot;kern&quot; table where each entry consists of a pair of characters and their kerning value. TrueType fonts typically have several hundred pairs, but some have more than a thousand.

Since OpenType is a superset of TrueType &quot;kern&quot; tables are still supported for TrueType fonts packed as OpenType; however, PostScript-based (CFF) OpenType fonts do not have this option. OpenType introduced a new, uniform way of specifying, among other things, kerning, via the Glyph Positioning Table (GPOS). The more recent font releases by Adobe no longer have &quot;kern&quot; tables at all, but only specify kerning via GPOS.

Since an OpenType font may include thousands of glyphs, and consequently a huge number of pairs of characters that need kerning, OpenType fonts may have an elaborate system of tables and subtables, designed to minimize the overall storage space. (Kerning is treated as part of a broad range of new glyph positioning features which are stored in GPOS.) The system is based on the concept of glyph &quot;classes&quot;: instead of a one-dimensional table where each entry corresponds to a pair of characters, there are two-dimensional tables where each entry corresponds to a pair of classes of glyphs. A class includes several characters whose right-hand outline (and right side-bearing) is identical for kerning purposes or several characters whose left-hand outline (and left side-bearing) is identical. All pairs of characters where the first one is from the first class and the second one is from the second class will require the same kerning value, so this value needs to be specified only once in the table. The rows in the two-dimensional table correspond to first-character classes, and the columns correspond to second-character classes. The kerning value for a given pair of characters is found in the table at the intersection of the classes to which they belong.

This system is very economical, but is necessarily limited. For example, many of the classes may be quite small. Also, a font with many types of glyphs may require several such tables. Finally, many pairs remain that cannot be represented through classes. For them, simpler, one-dimensional tables are provided: each table is for a particular character that is the first in many pairs, and the entries contain the characters that are the second in these pairs, together with the corresponding kerning values.

Here are a few examples of glyph classes in the Minion Pro font for the first character in a kerning pair: (d i l u), (h m n), (j q), (b o p), (v w y), (D O Q), (H I), (V W); and for the second character in a pair: (f i m n r), (h k l), (j p t u), (c d e o q), (v w y), (C G O Q), (B D E F H I K L N P R).

A category of letters that lend themselves well to class-based kerning is those with diacritical marks. These letters can be added to the class of the base letter, and can stay together whether they are the first or second character in a pair: (a à á â), (e è é ê), etc. A letter cannot be included in the class if its kerning is different from the others in certain pairs (for example, &quot;Yá&quot; vs. &quot;Yä&quot;).

Most modern office and desktop publishing systems support OpenType features, and hence class-based kerning.

===Automatic and manual kerning===
Automatic kerning refers to the kerning applied automatically by a program, as opposed to no kerning at all, or the kerning applied manually by the user. There are two types of automatic kerning: &quot;metric&quot; and &quot;optical&quot;. With metric kerning, the program directly uses the values found in the kerning tables included in the font file. Most systems with typographic features today provide this type of kerning. Optical kerning, on the other hand, is available only in the more advanced systems. With optical kerning, the program uses an algorithm to calculate, from their outlines, the optimal spacing for each pair of consecutive characters. With both types of automatic kerning, the system usually permits the user to specify a minimum font size for applying kerning, if the user feels that kerning is unnecessary for smaller font sizes.

With metric kerning, in a text that uses several fonts, the program must decide which kerning table to use when two consecutive characters belong to different the table from the font of the first character, or the second or to avoid kerning altogether. In this case, optical kerning is preferable. A common situation occurs when italic text ends with a roman symbol (right parenthesis or quotation mark, question mark, etc.) and the last letter&#x27;s slant clashes with the symbol.

Manual kerning, available in some systems, permits the user to override the automatic kerning and to apply any kerning value directly to a pair of characters in a particular place in the text. When not available, this feature can be simulated by using, for those two characters, the function that modifies the space between characters in a block of text (usually called tracking).

When employed by a skilled person, manual kerning will usually give better results than optical kerning; for example, some characters that may appear to an algorithmic comparison to be spaced very closely together may appear to a human reader too far apart, especially when the only element of a glyph that is “too close” is a diacritic mark. Manual kerning may even be better than the metric kerning built into the kerning table by the font&#x27;s designer, since these tables often have errors or omissions, or the difference may simply be a matter of personal preference.

===Contextual kerning===

Contextual kerning refers to positional adjustment that depends on more than two consecutive glyphs. For example, the spacing of a certain glyph may depend not only on the preceding glyph (as in ordinary kerning) but also on the one following it. Although rarely implemented in ordinary documents, contextual kerning is a concern in quality typography.

An example of a situation that demands contextual kerning in the Minion Pro font is the sequence of three characters &quot;f.”&quot; (&quot;f&quot;, period, quotation mark), as is often found at the end of a quotation. Using the font&#x27;s kerning tables, the quotation mark is too close to the &quot;f&quot;, although without the period between them their spacing is adequate. The period, in other words, reduces their spacing instead of increasing it. The explanation is this: without the period, their kerning is a positive 121 (expressed as 1,000 units/em). The period&#x27;s width is 228, but the kerning between &quot;f&quot; and the period is −5, and between the period and the quotation mark −138. The total is a positive 85, as opposed to the original 121: a net loss of 36 units, which explains why the quotation mark is now closer to the &quot;f&quot;. Contextual kerning would recognize the sequence of three characters, and would increase one or both inter-character spaces. A similar problem exists with the letters &quot;F&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot;; with comma rather than period; or with single rather than double quotation mark.

Contextual kerning is supported by the OpenType font format, but few font designers implement it, and probably no desktop publishing systems can currently use it. When important, the solution for a user is to employ manual kerning instead.

===Kerning of subscripts and superscripts===
While the OpenType math standard does not include support for kerning of subscripts or superscripts, Microsoft&#x27;s implementation adds extensions to support this feature as of Office 2007.

===Kerning tools===
Font editors allow the user to modify the properties of a font, including its kerning table (if the font license permits it). They accomplish this by modifying the table found in the actual font file. The user can change the kerning value in existing pairs, or add new pairs.

A few desktop publishing systems allow the user to change or add kerning pairs without modifying the font file itself. The system merely applies to the user&#x27;s document the new kerning values, in place of the values found in the font file.

Whether modifying the font file with a font editor or overriding it in a particular system, the user is limited to the existing kerning features. Thus, if one needs features like optical kerning, or contextual kerning, or kerning a pair of characters that belong to different fonts, and if the system lacks these features, other means must be employed.

Some desktop publishing systems permit developers to create plug-ins (extensions that perform a variety of functions that the system itself lacks), and this capability has also been used for kerning. In general, these plug-ins permit the user to apply a kerning change automatically to a certain character pair throughout an entire document, instead of applying it by searching manually for those pairs. So far only basic kerning features have been implemented through plug-ins, and it is unclear whether the more advanced features can be effectively implemented in this manner.

Instead of adding functionality to a desktop publishing system, a different approach is to export the document and process it outside that system. Any kerning features can then be applied to the document using tools ranging from ordinary text editors to programs specially developed for this task. The modified document is then imported back into the desktop publishing system. Many systems permit this operation, either by converting the document with import and export functions, or by making their internal document format an open standard. The benefit of this approach is that some complex typesetting functions that may be hard to implement through plug-ins (kerning in particular) may be relatively easy to implement through separate tools.

===Kerning in browsers===
The CSS property codice_1 enables kerning in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and the Android Browser. Another CSS property, codice_2, also enables kerning in Internet Explorer 10+, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and the Android Browser. There is also a proposed CSS3 property codice_3, which is supported in the major browsers. The CSS3 draft suggests that kerning should always be enabled for OpenType fonts.

Some critics have proposed to replace (at least some) OpenType-style GPOS kerning with spacer glyphs using OpenType&#x27;s Glyph Substitution Table (GSUB).

== Perception ==
The human perception of kerning can vary with the intraword and interword spacing during reading. Even without complete kerning control, the effect can be simulated by slight modifications to the space between letters. For instance, on webpages with CSS1, a standard dating back to 1996, the property offers options for &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;enhanced kerning perception&quot; by simply making the space between letters non-uniform. The newer CSS3 standard includes the property, which allows a complete control of kerning.

<doc id="226761" wikidata="Q7456276" url="?curid=226761" title="Set and drift">
<text>The term “set and drift” is used to describe external forces that affect a boat and keep it from following an intended course. To understand and calculate set and drift, one needs to first understand currents. Ocean currents are the horizontal movements of water from one location to another. The movement of water is impacted by: meteorological effects, wind, temperature differences, gravity, and on occasion earthquakes. Set is the current&#x27;s direction, expressed in true degrees. Drift is the current&#x27;s speed, which is usually measured in knots. “Leeway” refers to the amount of sidewards translation of a vessel drifting off of or away from the intended course of travel (with no correction or compensation by altering the heading of the vessel such as pointing her into the wind.) 

Ignoring set and drift can cause a mariner to get off their desired course, sometimes by hundreds of miles. A mariner needs to be able to steer the ship and compensate for the effects of set and drift upon their vessel while underway. The actual course a vessel travels is referred to as the course over the ground. The current of the ocean alters this course whether pushing it away from its desired course or in the same direction. The vessel&#x27;s speed through the water is referred to as the boatspeed and the current can affect how fast or slow the vessel moves through the water.

== How to Calculate ==
In order to utilize set and drift in navigation, navigators must first set the course using Dead Reckoning.

A Dead Reckoning, DR, is calculated by using a previously determined position on a chart, and advancing that position based on known or estimated speed over a set amount of time. This can be calculated by using the formula Speed = Distance ÷ Time.

Once an advance position has been plotted, then set and drift can be factored in. If there is a known set and drift, then the corrections can be applied to the Dead Reckoning position to then get an Estimated Position on a chart.

The Course Made Good is the direction in which a ship or vessel has traveled with the effects of current, wind, and helmsmanship. If a current is flowing in the same direction as the ships heading, then the Course Made Good remains the same, but the current speed and ship speed are added together. If the speeds are in opposite directions, then the smaller speed is subtracted from the larger speed. If a vessel runs directly against a current or directly with a current, the speed of the vessel and speed of the current can be added or subtracted from each other. Such as, a vessel has a speed of 8 knots through the water and the vessel is traveling with the current, which is at 2 knots, then the speed over ground is 8+2 and the vessel&#x27;s true speed is 10 knots.

Set and Drift can be calculated by using a vector diagram and can be drawn and measured on a chart, maneuvering board or even a plain piece of paper.

== Example Calculation ==

You are underway on course 150 degrees true at 8 knots. Your vessel is making good a course of 166 degrees true and a speed made good of 8.8 knots. What is your set and drift?

* Step 1. Plot out course of 150 degrees true on Radar Plotting Sheet
* Step 2. Measure length of course by using speed of 8 knots and converting into nautical miles via the time, speed, and distance scale
* Step 3. Plot the length of speed on Radar Plotting sheet
* Step 4. Plot out desired course of 166 degrees true on Radar Plotting Sheet
* Step 5. Measure length of course by using speed of 8.8 knots and converting into nautical miles via the time, speed, and distance scale
* Step 6. Connect the two ends of the vectors from the current course to the course made good. Thus creating your set and drift vector
* Step 7. Using the navigational triangle, place on set and drift vector. Then drag to center crosshairs keeping the same angle and find the degrees on the outer circle
* Step 8. Measure the length of the set and drift vector with the compass. Convert from nautical miles into knots using the time, speed, and distance scale.
* Step 9. Your set is 230 degrees true at a drift of 2.5 knots

== Tools used to calculate ==
To use Navigation Triangles, a navigator need two of them to be able to navigate correctly. Navigation Triangles can be used to find Lines of Positions, Dead Reckoning, ranges, Estimated Positions, Running Fixes and so on. They are also used to connect all the types of fixes to be able to determine a course.

Dividers can be used for the measurement of lengths of lines on a chart and approximating the lengths of non-linear lines on a chart. Dividers can also be turned into a compass by replacing the metal leg of the divider with a piece of lead. A compass can measure and draw arc and circles on charts and maneuvering boards.

<text>Print circulation is the average number of copies of a publication. The number of copies of a non-periodical publication (such as a book) are usually called print run. Circulation is not always the same as copies sold, often called paid circulation, since some issues are distributed without cost to the reader. Readership figures are usually higher than circulation figures because of the assumption that a typical copy is read by more than one person.

== Concept ==
Print circulation is a good proxy measure of print readership and is thus one of the principal factors used to set print advertising rates (prices). In many countries, circulations are audited by independent bodies such as the Audit Bureau of Circulations to assure advertisers that a given newspaper does reach the number of people claimed by the publisher. There are international open access directories such as &quot;Mondo Times&quot;, but these generally rely on numbers reported by newspapers themselves.

== World newspapers with the largest circulation ==
The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) publishes a list of newspapers with the largest circulation. In 2011, India led the world in terms of newspaper circulation with nearly 330 million newspapers circulated daily. In 2010, China topped the list in term of total newspaper circulation with 110.78 million a day, ahead of India in second with 100.993 million, followed by Japan, with 50.4 million; the United States, with 48.5 million; and Germany, with 19.7 million. In the 2019 survey, among the top 10 newspapers, all were Asian newspapers and four were Japanese newspapers.

The Japanese &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; (), &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; () are still the largest circulated newspapers in the world. &quot;The Times of India&quot; is the largest circulated English-language daily newspaper in the world, across all formats (Broadsheet, Compact, Berliner and Online). &quot;Reference News&quot; () is the most popular paper in China.

According to the Guinness Book of Records, the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991.

In many developed countries, print circulation is falling due to social and technological changes such as the availability of news on the internet. On the other hand, in some developing countries circulation is increasing as these factors are more than cancelled out by rising incomes, population, and literacy.

==Individual countries==
===Australia===
&quot;The Herald Sun&quot; has the highest circulation in Australia. Based in one of the country&#x27;s two major cities, Melbourne, it is the result of the amalgamation of the original &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Herald&quot; newspapers.

===Belgium===

According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations the newspaper with the UK&#x27;s highest paid circulation is the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; at 667,299 as of November 2024.

===United States===
The heyday of the newspaper industry was the 1940s, but the percentage of Americans reading newspapers began to decline with the increased competition from radio, television and, more recently, the Internet. A growing population helped the absolute circulation numbers continue to increase until the 1970s, where it remained stable until the 1990s, when absolute circulation numbers began declining.

Newspaper circulation numbers are reported to the Alliance for Audited Media. The best-selling papers in America, measured by combined daily average circulation as of March 31, 2013, are the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; with 2,378,827 in circulation; &quot;The New York Times&quot; at 1,865,318; and &quot;USA Today&quot; with 1,674,306. Overall, for the 593 reporting newspapers, daily circulation declined 0.7 percent year-over-year between March 2012 and March 2013. Sunday circulation was down 1.4 percent over the same period.

<doc id="226767" wikidata="Q3764157" url="?curid=226767" title="Eenadu">
<text>Eenadu (; ) is the largest circulated Telugu-language daily newspaper In India predominantly distributed in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Founded by Ramoji Rao in 1974 in Visakhapatnam, it has been a significant presence in Telugu journalism. Ramoji Rao served as the Chief Editor until 2020.

== Name ==
&quot;Eenadu&quot; is a polysemic word which has two meanings in Telugu language &quot;today/this day&quot; and &quot;this land&quot;.

== History ==

===Early days in Visakhapatnam===
&quot;Eenadu&quot; was launched from Visakhapatnam on 10 August 1974 by Ramoji Rao, a businessman who had previously achieved success with Priya Pickles and Margadarsi Chitfunds. At that time, the &quot;Andhra Prabha&quot;, owned by the Indian Express Group, was the leading regional newspaper.

Initially, the circulation of &quot;Eenadu&quot; was limited. When launched in the city of Visakhapatnam, it was not able to sell more than 3,000 copies a week. &quot;Eenadu&quot; found itself struggling to become a daily publication among publications. However, it was popular in certain regions and rivalry was still an issue. &quot;Eenadu&quot; hired a new set of directors to be part of its key decision and management group which drove it towards what it is today: the most highly circulated newspaper in the region.

=== Expansion to other regions ===
&quot;Eenadu&quot; began with a print order of 4,000 copies, composed by hand and produced using a second-hand printing press. But by the time it was admitted into the Audit Bureau of Circulations in 1976, its circulation had already reached a readership of 48,000. By 1978, &quot;Eenadu&quot; surpassed &quot;Andhra Prabha&quot;″s circulation and, by 1995, two other rivals &quot;Andhra Patrika&quot; and &quot;Udayam&quot; folded, leaving &quot;Eenadu&quot; with over seventy-five percent of the audited circulation of Telugu dailies. 

Its expansion has partially been attributed to its use of regional dialects, colloquialisms, idioms and sarcasm in its reporting, as well as colorful pictures with captions.

When &quot;Eenadu&quot; expanded to Hyderabad in 1975, it divided the city into target areas, recruited delivery boys three months in advance and handed out the paper freely for a week. During the 1980s, technology-enabled &quot;Eenadu&quot; to spread over larger areas beyond only the main cities. Earlier, it was difficult to manage even the three editions of the 1970s (the Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Hyderabad editions) because the only communication facilities available to the publication at the time were the telegram, telephone, and teleprinter, all of which had limited presence in rural Andhra Pradesh.

By 1979, the newspaper expanded to include &quot;Sitara&quot;, a weekly film magazine, &quot;Vipula&quot;, a monthly magazine with short stories, &quot;Chatura&quot;, a monthly novel and &quot;Annadatha&quot;, a farmer&#x27;s monthly. However, the magazines stopped circulation in 2017 due to lack of demand in favour of web content.

=== Political impact and TDP support ===
Support of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) by &quot;Eenadu&quot; has been recorded since the party&#x27;s foundation in 1982. This has been attributed to Ramoji Rao&#x27;s disdain for the Congress government, to the point that he planned to create a regional party on his own accord, and a personal rapport he formed with the party founder and leader N. T. Rama Rao, who he had first doubted but eventually saw political potential in. Another factor that has been cited is caste politics, with both &quot;Eenadu&quot; and the TDP being perceived as Kamma-oriented organisations and both Raos being Kammas themselves, although this view has been challenged. During the 1983 elections, the party and the paper formed a symbiotic relationship as &quot;Eenadu&quot; not only publicised, promoted and ran positive stories on Rama Rao&#x27;s campaign, but also gave more direct support, such as utilising its network of journalists to inform and advise Rama Rao on local issues for his stops and designing party advertisements through Ramoji Rao&#x27;s marketing agency. This coverage led to a massive increase in subscriptions, with &quot;Eenadu&quot; going from a circulation of 230,000 copies to 350,000 in the six months of Rama Rao&#x27;s electoral campaign and becoming one of the state&#x27;s most popular newspapers. The TDP would go on to successfully sweep the election, making Rama Rao the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, and over half a million copies were printed of &quot;Eenadu&quot; to declare this victory. Reportedly, Ramoji Rao sent a bill to Rama Rao for 3 million (30 lakh) rupees for the assistance he had given to the campaign. In response, film personality Dasari Narayana Rao and industrialist Gireesh Kumar Sanghi would launch pro-Congress newspapers of their own and eventually become members of the Rajya Sabha on the Congress ticket.

When Rama Rao and his government faced crises and parliamentary revolts in the 1980s, &quot;Eenadu&quot; continually supported him and clamored for his restoration to power. Despite Rama Rao&#x27;s growing unpopularity in the later part of the decade due to perceptions of failed promises, the paper refrained from criticising him before expressing some concerns about his leadership in response to his continued loss of public support and the Congress victory in the 1989 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election. In the 1990s, as fissures developed between Rama Rao and his son-in-law and prominent party leader Chandrababu Naidu, &quot;Eenadu&quot; ultimately took Naidu&#x27;s side, publishing mocking portrayals of Rama Rao depicting him as being manipulated by his new wife Lakshmi Parvathi, and eventually played a key role in the internal party coup by supporting Naidu&#x27;s power grab. This paved the way for Naidu to become the next Chief Minister and ensured a friendly relationship between the paper and his administration. During the reign of Congress governments, &quot;Eenadu&quot; went on the offensive and became their &quot;chief critic&quot;; both Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy and his son Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy would &quot;fight back&quot; during their time in power. This took on multiple forms, from the 2004 investigation of Margadarsi for irregular financial practices to the launch of &quot;Sakshi&quot; in 2008 under Jagan Mohan Reddy&#x27;s ownership as a &quot;counter&quot; to what his father, the CM at the time, claimed was &quot;biased news&quot; from traditionally TDP-supporting papers.

=== Further publications ===
With the introduction of offset printing, photocomposing software and computers, &quot;Eenadu&quot; was able to launch editions in smaller towns like Tirupathi in 1982. From the 1980s, the news editor of &quot;Eenadu&quot; oversaw an enormous local-based news gathering and disseminating organization from his Hyderabad office.

By the end of the 1980s, there were six substantial Telugu dailies running, and the business was highly competitive. In 1989 &quot;Eenadu&quot; introduced &quot;district dailies (tabloid edition)&quot; to carry its presence not only into district towns like Rajamahendravaram, Karimnagar, Guntur and Adilabad, but also &quot;taluka&quot; towns like Suryapet and Tadepalligudem. Each publication center required forty engineers to run its printing presses. &quot;Eenadu&quot;″s district dailies were based on market research asserting that heavy local content would generate new groups of readers and boost advertising revenue. Currently, the district dailies print local news specifically for each major location in the area, thereby negating the need for any separate local daily. Few special sections are published every day of the week. To support the local tabloid dailies, &quot;Eenadu&quot; hired &quot;stringers&quot; working for the commission who coordinated their reporting with editors over the telephone and contracted bus companies to transport their reports back to the district headquarters for publication. Additionally, to increase revenue, the newspaper recruited salespersons to convince local businesses to buy ad spots.

&quot;Eenadu&quot; later ventured into other markets such as finance and chit funds (e.g. Margadarsi chits), foods (Priya Foods), film production (Ushakiran Movies), film distribution (Mayuri Films), and television (ETV). All the businesses are organized under the Ramoji Group.

== Ownership ==
Eenadu newspaper is owned by Ushodaya Enterprises Private Limited, a part of Ramoji Group. As per the 2018 report of Media Ownership Monitor, Ramoji Rao and family own 97.56% stake in Ushodaya Enterprises. In terms of individual ownership, Ramoji Rao holds 42.26%, his eldest son Cherukuri Kiron holds 28.36%, and his daughter-in-law Cherukuri Vijayeswari (wife of the deceased younger son, Cherukuri Suman) holds 25.38% shares in Ushodaya Enterprises.

==Circulation==
According to the Audit bureau of circulation for the H12022, Eenadu had a circulation of 1,223,862, ranked at 7th place among daily newspapers in India. For Q2 2019, Eenadu ranks eighth among the most circulated Indian-language dailies with a circulation of 1,614,105. Thus there was a loss of 24.18% during COVID.

<doc id="226769" wikidata="Q680016" url="?curid=226769" title="Roaming">
<text>Roaming is a wireless telecommunication term typically used with mobile devices, such as mobile phones. It refers to a mobile phone being used outside the range of its native network and connecting to another available cell network.

== Technical definition ==
In more technical terms, roaming refers to &quot;the ability for a cellular customer to automatically make and receive voice calls, send and receive data, or access other services, including home data services, when travelling outside the geographical coverage area of the home network, by means of using a visited network&quot;. For example: should a subscriber travel beyond their cell phone company&#x27;s transmitter range, their cell phone would automatically hop onto another phone company&#x27;s service, if available.

The process is supported by the Telecommunication processes of mobility management, authentication, authorization and accounting billing procedures (known as AAA or &#x27;triple A&#x27;).

== Roaming in general ==

Roaming is divided into &quot;SIM-based roaming&quot; and &quot;username/password-based roaming&quot;, whereby the technical term &quot;roaming&quot; also encompasses roaming between networks of different network standards, e.g. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) or GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications). Device equipment and functionality, such as SIM card capability, antenna and network interfaces, and power management, determine the access possibilities.

Using the example of WLAN/GSM roaming, the following scenarios can be differentiated (cf. GSM Association Permanent Reference Document AA.39):
* SIM-based (roaming): GSM subscriber roams onto a public WLAN operated by:
** their GSM operator, or
** another operator who has a roaming agreement with their GSM operator.
* Username/password based roaming: GSM subscriber roams onto a public WLAN operated by:
** their GSM operator, or
** another operator who has a roaming agreement with their GSM operator.

Although these user/network scenarios focus on roaming from GSM network operator&#x27;s networks, clearly roaming can be bi-directional, i.e. from public WLAN operators to GSM networks. Traditional roaming in networks of the same standard, e.g. from a WLAN to a WLAN or a GSM network to a GSM network, has already been described above and is likewise defined by the foreignness of the network based on the type of subscriber entry in the home subscriber register.

In the case of session continuity, seamless access to these services across different access types is provided.

== Roaming (electric vehicles) ==
The term &quot;roaming&quot;, also known as &quot;e-roaming&quot;, is a concept for charging battery electric vehicles (BEVs) at other charging stations. In practice, e-roaming allows EV drivers to achieve greater interoperability by providing access to public charging points from any owner/operator&#x27;s EV charging network through a common platform and a single network subscription or contract.

There are proprietary (closed) charging networks, such as Tesla Superchargers, or providers sharing charging points through contracts and agreements. Thus, the EV can &quot;roam&quot; between those charging points. 

== Home and visited networks ==

&quot;Home network&quot; refers to the network the subscriber is registered with.

&quot;Visitor network&quot; refers to the network a subscriber roams temporarily and is outside the bounds of the &quot;home network&quot;.

== Roaming agreements ==

The legal roaming business aspects negotiated between the roaming partners for billing of the services obtained are usually stipulated in so called &quot;roaming agreements.&quot; The GSM Association broadly outlines the content of such roaming agreements in standardized form for its members. For the legal aspects of authentication, authorization and billing of the visiting subscriber, the roaming agreements typically can comprise minimal safety standards, as e.g. location update procedures or financial security or warranty procedures.

== The roaming process ==
The details of the roaming process differ among types of cellular networks, but in general, the process resembles the following:

=== Location update ===
Location updating is the mechanism that is used to determine the location of an MS in the idle state (connected to the network, but with no active call).
# When the mobile device is turned on or is transferred via a handover to the network, this new &quot;visited&quot; network sees the device, notices that it is not registered with its own system, and attempts to identify its home network. If there is no roaming agreement between the two networks, maintenance of service is impossible, and service is denied by the visited network.
# The visited network contacts the home network and requests service information (including whether or not the mobile should be allowed to roam) about the roaming device using the IMSI number.
# If successful, the visited network begins to maintain a temporary subscriber record for the device. Likewise, the home network updates its information to indicate that the cell phone is on the visited network so that any information sent to that device can be correctly routed.

=== Mobile terminated call ===
It occurs for example when a call is made to a roaming cell phone.

Signaling process:
# The calling subscriber (from within the public telephone network) dials the mobile subscriber&#x27;s MSISDN (the telephone number) of the roaming cell phone.
# Based on the information contained in the MSISDN (national destination code and the country code), the call is routed to the mobile network gateway MSC (GMSC). It&#x27;s done with an ISUP IAM message.
# To locate the MS, the GMSC sends to the HLR a MAP SRI (Send Routing Information) message. The MAP SRI message contains the MSISDN number and with this MSISDN the HLR will obtain the IMSI.
# Because of past location updates, the HLR already knows the VLR that currently serves the subscriber. The HLR will send to the VLR a MAP PRN (Provide Roaming Number) message to obtain the MSRN of the roaming cell phone. Like that the HLR will be able to route the call to the correct MSC.
# With the IMSI contained in the MAP PRN message, the VLR assigns a temporary number known as the mobile station roaming number (MSRN) to the roaming cell phone. This MSRN number is sent back to the HLR in a MAP RIA (Routing Information Acknowledgement) message.
# Now with the MSRN number, the GMSC knows how to route the call to reach the roaming cell phone. Then, the call is made using ISUP (or TUP) signaling between the GMSC and the visited MSC. The GMSC will generate an ISUP IAM message with the MSRN as the called party number (and NOT the MSISDN as the called party number).
# When the MSC of the visitor network receives the IAM, it recognizes the MSRN and knows the IMSI for which the MSRN was allocated. The MSC then returns the MSRN to the pool for future use on another call. Afterwards, the MSC sends to the VLR a MAP SI (Send Information) message to request information like the called MS&#x27;s capabilities, services subscribed to, and so on. If the called MS is authorized and capable of taking the call, the VLR sends a MAP CC (Complete Call) message back to the MSC.

In order that a subscriber is able to register on to a visited network, a roaming agreement needs to be in place between the visited network and the home network. This agreement is established after a series of testing processes called IREG (International Roaming Expert Group) and TADIG (Transferred Account Data Interchange Group). While the IREG testing is to test the proper functioning of the established communication links, the TADIG testing is to check the billability of the calls.

The usage by a subscriber in a visited network is captured in a file called the TAP (Transferred Account Procedure) for GSM / CIBER (Cellular Intercarrier Billing Exchange Record) for CDMA, AMPS etc... file and is transferred to the home network. A TAP/CIBER file contains details of the calls made by the subscriber viz. location, calling party, called party, time of call and duration, etc. The TAP/CIBER files are rated as per the tariffs charged by the visited operator. The home operator then bills these calls to its subscribers and may charge a mark-up/tax applicable locally.
As recently many carriers launched own retail rate plans and bundles for Roaming, TAP records are generally used for wholesale Inter-Operators settlements only

== Tariffs ==

Roaming fees are typically charged on a per-minute basis for wireless voice service, per text message sent and received and per megabyte of data used for data service, and they are typically determined by the service provider&#x27;s pricing plan.

Several carriers in both the United States and India have eliminated these fees in their nationwide pricing plans. All of the major carriers now offer pricing plans that allow consumers to purchase nationwide roaming-free minutes. However, carriers define &quot;nationwide&quot; in different ways. For example, some carriers define &quot;nationwide&quot; as anywhere in the U.S., whereas others define it as anywhere within the carrier&#x27;s network.

In the UK, the main network providers generally send text alerts to advise users that they will now be charged international rates so it is clear when this will apply. UK data roaming charges abroad vary depending on the nature of the phone agreement (either pay as you go or monthly contracts). Some carriers, including T-Mobile and Virgin Mobile, do not allow pay as you go customers to use international roaming without pre-purchase of an international &quot;add on&quot; or &quot;bolt on.&quot;

An operator intending to provide roaming services to visitors publishes the tariffs that would be charged in their network at least sixty days prior to its implementation under normal situations. The visited operator tariffs may include tax, discounts etc. and would be based on duration in case of voice calls. For data calls, the charging may be based on the data volume sent and received. Some operators also charge a separate fee for call setup i.e. for the establishment of a call. This charge is called a &quot;flagfall&quot; charge.

=== Roaming within the EU ===

In the European Union, regulation on roaming charges began on 30 June 2007, forcing service providers to lower their roaming fees across the 28-member bloc. It later also included EEA member states. The regulation set a price cap of €0.39 (€0.49 in 2007, €0.46 in 2008, €0.43 in 2009) per minute for outgoing calls, and €0.15 (€0.24 in 2007, €0.22 in 2008, €0.19 in 2009) per minute for incoming calls - excluding tax. Having still found that market conditions did not justify lifting the capping of roaming within the EEA, the Commission replaced the law in 2012. Under the 2012 Regulation, retail roaming capping charges expired in 2017 and wholesale capping charges expired in 2022. In mid-2009 there was also an €0.11 (excluding tax) maximum price for SMS text message included into this regulation.

On 11 June 2013, the European Commission voted to end mobile roaming charges for the first time.

Following a European Commission vote on 15 December 2016, roaming charges within the European Union were to be abolished by June 2017. While the European Commission (EC) believed that ending roaming charges would stimulate entrepreneurship and trade, mobile operators had their doubts about the changes.

On 15 June 2017, Regulation (EU) 2016/2286, nicknamed &quot;Roam like at Home&quot; and having been signed by the European Parliament and Commission in May of the same year came into force. It abolished all roaming charges within the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

=== Roaming between other countries ===
Countries that do not share a supra-national authority have also begun examining the provision of international roaming services. In April 2011, Singapore and Malaysia announced that they had agreed with operators to reduce voice and SMS rates for roaming between their two countries. In August 2012, Australia and New Zealand published a draft report proposing coordinated action on roaming services. This was followed by a final report in February 2013 recommending that the two countries equip their telecommunications regulators with an extended palette of regulatory remedies, when they investigate international roaming. The Australian and New Zealand prime ministers subsequently announced that they would introduce legislation to effect the recommendations of the final report.

On 19 February 2020, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru voted, through the auspice of the Andean Community, to eliminate roaming fees amongst themselves. The agreement is set to start in 2022.

On 1 July 2021, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Kosovo abolished roaming fees as part of Mini Schengen project, allowing SIM holders on those countries to use their domestic packages on another country in the agreement without having to pay their roaming fee. The agreement was signed in April 2019. There are no additional charges, just like in EU&#x27;s &quot;Roaming like home&quot; project.

In November 2021, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Chad and Gabon committed to bilateral agreements to lift charges and cut interconnection tariffs.

== Other types of roaming ==
===Regional or internal roaming===
This type refers to the ability of moving from one region to another region inside national coverage of the mobile operator (&quot;internal roaming&quot;). Initially, operators may have provided commercial offers restricted to a region (sometimes to a town). Due to the success of GSM and the decrease in cost, regional roaming is rarely offered to clients except in nations with wide geographic areas like the US, Russia, India, etc., in which there are a number of regional operators.

Prior to 2019, in Russia even country-wide operators charged different tariffs depending on whether the users are within or outside of their &quot;home region&quot;. A number of legislative attempts in early days to remove the &quot;internal roaming&quot; failed due to opposition from operators. Following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 the Russian operators faced significant criticism as they did not offer their services inside Crimea directly, even though formally it&#x27;s recognized as a regular federal subject inside Russia. In 2019 however, Federal Law No. 527-FZ &quot;On Amendments to Articles 46 and 54 of the Federal Law &quot;On Communications&quot;&quot; was adopted, according to which, starting June 1, 2019, all mobile radiotelephone operators were prohibited charging a fee for incoming calls and SMS when registering in the network of a third-party operator (roaming partner), regardless of the region of Russia in which the subscriber is located, leading to all fees for incoming calls and SMS in national roaming being canceled for good.

===National roaming===
This type refers to the ability to move from one mobile operator to another in the same country. For example, a postpaid subscriber of T-Mobile USA who is allowed to roam on AT&amp;T Mobility and/or the regional carriers Viaero Wireless and U.S. Cellular&#x27;s networks would have national roaming rights; prepaid providers on the other hand typically only allow a more restricted national roaming ability for cost reasons. For commercial and license reasons, this type of roaming is not allowed unless under very specific circumstances and under regulatory scrutiny. This has often taken place when a new company is assigned a mobile telephony license (such as Free Italia&#x27;s 10-year national roaming deal with Wind Tre), to create a more competitive market by allowing the new entrant to offer coverage comparable to that of established operators (by requiring the existing operators to allow roaming while the new entrant has time to build up its own network), or where mobile network infrastructure has been destroyed by natural or man-made means, such as during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine where Ukrainian mobile operators had to quickly implement national roaming with each other to compensate for network infrastructure destroyed in said invasion.

In a country like India, where the number of regional operators is high and the country is divided into &quot;telecom circles,&quot; this type of roaming is common. Following the launch of the Pebble Network in the UK on 15 July 2015, national roaming has been possible across the major UK networks at no additional cost using a Pebble Network SIM card.

===International roaming===
This type of roaming refers to the ability to move to a foreign service provider&#x27;s network. It is, consequently, of particular interest to international tourists and business travelers. Broadly speaking, international roaming is typically easiest when using the GSM standard, as it is used by over 80% of the world&#x27;s mobile operators, and most devices support it. However, even then, there may be problems, since countries have allocated different frequency bands for GSM communications (there are two groups of countries: most GSM countries use 900/1800 MHz, but the United States and some other countries in the Americas have allocated 850/1900 MHz): for a phone to work in a country with a different frequency allocation, it must support one or both of that country&#x27;s frequencies, and thus be tri or quad band. If international roaming allows the traveler to stay connected during their trip, it can also generate significant costs for users, due to the trend of carriers pricing GSM usage internationally outrageously high if the traveler elects to not purchase an optional addon to their current phone service. In fact, the use of mobile networks outside its original country can lead to significant billing by its original mobile data operator without an addon to their current phone service.

===Inter-standards roaming===
This type refers to roaming between two standards. This term is now widely used in mobile communications where especially CDMA customers want to use their phone in areas where there is no CDMA network or there is no roaming agreement in place to support roaming on the used standard. In Europe there are hardly any CDMA networks. Most CDMA customers originate from the Americas or the Far East. In order to enable them to roam in Europe inter-standard roaming is the solution. The CDMA customers arriving in Europe can register on the available GSM networks.

Since mobile communication technologies have evolved independently across continents, there is significant challenge in achieving seamless roaming across these technologies. Typically, these technologies were implemented in accordance with technological standards laid down by different industry bodies and hence the name. A number of the standards making industry bodies have come together to define and achieve interoperability between the technologies as a means to achieve inter-standards roaming. This is currently an ongoing effort.

===Mobile signature roaming===

Mobile signature roaming allows an access point to get a mobile signature from any end-user, even if the AP and the end-user have not contracted a commercial relationship with the same MSSP. Otherwise, an AP would have to build commercial terms with as many MSSPs as possible, and this might be a cost burden. This means that a mobile signature transaction issued by an Application Provider should be able to reach the appropriate MSSP, and this should be transparent for the AP.

===Inter-MSC roaming===
Network elements belonging to the same Operator but located in different areas (a typical situation where assignment of local licenses is a common practice) pair depends on the switch and its location. Hence, software changes and a greater processing capability are required, but furthermore this situation could introduce the fairly new concept of roaming on a per MSC basis instead of per Operator basis. But this is actually a burden, so it is avoided.

===Permanent roaming===
This type refers to customers who purchase service with a mobile phone operator intending to permanently roam, or be off-network. This becomes possible because of the increasing popularity and availability of &quot;free roaming&quot; service plan, where there is no cost difference between on and off network usage. The benefits of getting service from a mobile phone operator, that is not local to a user, can include cheaper rates, or features and phones that are not available on their local mobile phone operator, or to get to a particular mobile phone operator&#x27;s network to get free calls to other customers of that mobile phone operator through a free unlimited mobile to mobile feature.

Most mobile phone operators will require the customer&#x27;s living or billing address be inside their coverage area or less often inside the government issued radio frequency license of the mobile phone operator, this is usually determined by a computer estimate because it is impossible to guarantee coverage. If a potential customer&#x27;s address is not within the requirements of that mobile phone operator, they will be denied service. In order to permanently roam customers may use a false address and online billing, or a relative or friend&#x27;s address which is in the required area, and a 3rd party billing option.

Most mobile phone operators discourage or prohibit permanent roaming since they must pay per minute rates to the network operator their customer is roaming onto. This is because they can not pass that extra cost onto customers (&quot;free roaming&quot;).

===Trombone roaming===

Roaming calls within a local tariff area, when at least one of the phones belong outside that area. Usually implemented with &quot;trombone routing&quot; also known as &quot;tromboning&quot;.

<doc id="226770" wikidata="Q6047375" url="?curid=226770" title="Intermediate sanctions">
<text>Intermediate sanctions is a term used in regulations enacted by the United States Internal Revenue Service that is applied to certain types of non-profit organizations who engage in transactions that inure to the benefit of a &quot;disqualified person&quot; within the organization. These regulations allow the IRS to penalize the organization and the disqualified person receiving the benefit. Intermediate sanctions may be imposed either in addition to or instead of revocation of the exempt status of the organization.

==Summary==

The &quot;Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2&quot; which came into force on July 30, 1996, added section 4958 to the Internal Revenue Code. Section 4958 adds intermediate sanctions as an alternative to revocation of the exempt status of an organization when private persons benefit from transactions with a 501(c)(3) public charity or 501(c)(4) non-profit organization. NOTE: 501(c)(3) private foundations are subject to similar regulations found in Section 4941 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Intermediate Sanctions may be imposed on any &quot;disqualified person&quot; who receives an &quot;excess benefit&quot; from a covered non-profit organization and on each &quot;organization manager&quot; who approves an excess benefit. If you are a disqualified person you are subject to having participated in an excess benefit transaction, if the transaction is so defined.

Being a disqualified person does not automatically result in a finding that a transaction involves an excess benefit. If you are not a disqualified person, then you cannot be subject to an excess benefit (your transaction with the non-profit organization is considered to be at arm&#x27;s length).

If there is a finding that there has been an excess benefit, the disqualified person must reimburse the organization to place the organization back in the position it was in before the excess benefit transaction was completed. As well, there are stiff interest penalties and excise penalties in excess of 200%. The organizational managers who participated in the transaction may also be fined an aggregate of $10,000 per violation and are jointly and severally liable for payment of such penalty. These penalties are cumulative, thus an individual may be liable as a disqualified person and as an organization manager.

==History==

The &quot;Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2&quot; (effective July 30, 1996) added section 4958 to the Internal Revenue Code. On August 4, 1998, the IRS proposed regulations to implement IRC 4958. On March 16 and 17, 1999, the IRS held public hearings on these proposed regulations. It was not until January 10, 2001, that the IRS issued Temporary Regulations, which were to be effective for up to 3 years. Then, on January 23, 2002, the Final Regulations were issued, superseding the Temporary Regulations.

On September 9, 2005, the IRS announced proposed rulemaking to clarify the relationship between penalties imposed under section 4958 and revocation of exempt status.

==Who is a Disqualified Person?==

You are a disqualified person if you are a person who, during five years beginning after September 13, 1995, and ending on the date of the transaction in question, were in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the exempt organization. Note: You can be an individual, another organization, a partnership or unincorporated association, trust or estate.

In affiliated organizations, your substantial influence must be determined separately for each organization but &quot;benefits&quot; provided by a controlled entity will be treated as being provided by the exempt organization. A person may be a disqualified person for more than one organization.

The intermediate sanction statute identifies certain persons as having substantial influence as a matter of law — such persons are conclusively presumed to be disqualified persons. The temporary regulations identify additional categories of those who have a substantial influence. The IRS considers these individuals to be presumptively disqualified.

Under the statute, the following are disqualified:

*&quot;A family member&quot; (spouse, siblings and their spouses, ancestors, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and spouses of children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren) of a disqualified person. A legally adopted child is a child.
*&quot;An organization&quot; (corporation, partnership, trust or estate) owned 35% or more, directly or indirectly, by a disqualified person, or family member(s). This does not include voting rights held only as a director, trustee, or other fiduciary, without any stock, profit or other beneficial interest.

Other persons defined by the regulations as having substantial interest include:

* &quot;Members of the governing board&quot; of the organization who are entitled to vote on matters over which the governing body has authority (e.g., directors, elders, trustees, steering committee members, etc.).
* &quot;Executive officers of the organization&quot;, such as president, chief executive officer, and chief operating officer — the exact title is used is irrelevant; includes any individual who has ultimate responsibility for implementing board decisions or for supervising the management, administration or operations of the organization. Responsibilities may be shared by more than one individual. If a person has a title of president, chief executive officer or chief operating officer that person will be disqualified unless they can show otherwise.
* &quot;The treasurer or chief financial officer&quot; — including anyone who has or shares responsibility for managing the organization&#x27;s financial assets, regardless of actual title. Several persons may share this responsibility. Once again, any person with the title of treasurer or chief financial officer will be considered to have this ultimate responsibility unless shown otherwise.
* If a hospital participates in a provider-sponsored organization then &quot;any person who has a material financial interest in the organization&quot; (e.g., a person involved in a joint venture with the organization).

==Not a Disqualified Person==

Under the temporary regulations certain persons are deemed not to have substantial influence including:

*501(c)(3) organizations.
*With respect to a 501(c)(4) organization, another organization described in 501(c)(4).
*Employees who do not fit into one of the categories listed above, provided they are not highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q)(1)(B)(i) - compensation in excess of $80,000, as adjusted by the IRS) or substantial contributors (as defined in section 507(d)(2)(A), taking into account only contributions received during the current and the four preceding taxable years).

Facts and Circumstances Test

Whether an individual or organization is a disqualified person in any cases not under the above categories is determined by a &quot;facts and circumstances test&quot;. The regulations include two lists of facts and circumstances (1) including facts and circumstances that tend to show an individual &quot;has substantial influence&quot; and (2) including facts and circumstances that tend to show a person &quot;&#x27;does not&quot; have substantial influence.

(1). Facts and circumstances which tend to show a person has substantial influence include:

:# The person founded the organization.
:# The person is a substantial contributor to the organization (as defined in section 507(d)(2)(A), taking into account only contributions received during the current taxable year and the four preceding taxable years).
:# The person&#x27;s compensation is primarily based on revenues derived from an activity of the organization or a part thereof that the person controls (see further discussion about percentage payments, below).
:# The person has or shares authority to control or determine a substantial portion of the organization&#x27;s capital expenditures, operating budget, or compensation for employees.
:# The person manages a discrete segment or activity of the organization that represents a substantial portion of the organization&#x27;s activities, assets, income or expenses, as compared to the organization as a whole. For example, a person who manages one department that contributes significantly to the whole may be a disqualified person.
:# The person owns a controlling interest (measured either by vote or value) in an organization (corporation, partnership, trust) that is a disqualified person.
:# The person is a non-stock organization (such as a social club, homeowners association, etc.) controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more disqualified persons.

(2). Facts and circumstances which tend to show a person has no substantial influence include:

:#The organization is a religious organization and the person has taken a &quot;bona fide&quot; vow of poverty as an employee or agent, or on behalf of the organization.
:#The person is a contractor (e.g. an attorney, an accountant, or investment manager or advisor) whose sole relationship to the organization is providing professional advice (without having decision-making authority) with respect to transactions from which the contractor will not economically benefit, either directly or indirectly, apart from customary fees received for the professional advice rendered.
:#The direct supervisor of the individual is not a disqualified person.
:#The person does not participate in any management decisions affecting the organization as a whole or a discrete segment or activity of the organization that represents a substantial portion of the organization&#x27;s activities, assets, income or expenses, as compared to the organization as a whole.
:#Any preferential treatment a person receives which is based on the size of the person&#x27;s donation, is also offered to all other donors making a comparable contribution as part of a solicitation intended to attract a substantial number of contributions.

==Who is an Organization Manager?==

An organization manager is any officer, director, trustee, or person having similar powers or responsibilities, regardless of title. Officers are specifically designated under the articles or bylaws of the organization, or a person regularly exercising general authority to make administrative or policy decisions for the organization. If a person only makes recommendations, but cannot implement decisions without approval of a superior, that person is not an officer. The regulations make it clear that a &quot;contractor who acts solely in a capacity as an attorney, accountant, or investment manager or advisor is not an officer.&quot;

An organization manager includes anyone on a committee of the board (whether a member of the board), if the organization is claiming that the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness (see below) is based on the committee&#x27;s (or the designee&#x27;s) actions. If the committee is responsible for determining the reasonableness of a transaction, and this determination is relied upon by the organization, every member of the committee will be considered an organization manager.

When Does an Organization Manager Participate in a Transaction?

Silence or inaction can be participation by the organization manager if the manager is under a duty to speak or act, as well as any affirmative action. Abstention is considered consent to a transaction. Managers opposing the transaction in a manner consistent with their responsibilities to the organization are not be considered to have participated in the action.

Knowing Participation — &quot;Knowing&quot; means that the manager:
* has actual knowledge of sufficient facts which indicate, based solely on those facts, the transaction is an excess benefit transaction,
* is aware that the transaction may violate the law, and
* negligently fails to make reasonable attempts to ascertain whether the transaction is an excess benefit transaction or is, in fact, aware that it is such a transaction.

Although knowing does not mean having reason to know, under the regulations, evidence that a manager has reason to know is relevant to determine whether the manager has actual knowledge. It is up to the IRS to prove that the manager knowingly participated.

If an organization manager relies on a reasoned written opinion of an appropriate professional, his or her participation will ordinarily not be considered knowing. In addition, an organization manager&#x27;s participation is ordinarily not considered knowing if the requirements of the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness are satisfied.

Willful Participation — an organization manager participation is willful if it is voluntary, conscious and intentional. It is not willful if the manager does not know that the transaction is an excess benefit transaction.

Due to Reasonable Cause — if the manager exercised responsibility on behalf of the organization with ordinary business care and prudence participation is due to reasonable cause.

==Safe Harbor Provision of the Law==

Congress, in the legislative history, intended to create a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness, or &quot;safe harbor.&quot; Under this safe harbor, compensation is presumed to be reasonable and a property transfer is presumed to be at fair market value if: (1) the compensation arrangement or terms of transfer are approved, in advance, by an authorized body of the exempt organization, composed entirely of individuals without a conflict of interest, (2) the board or committee obtained and relied upon appropriate data as to comparability in making its determination; and (3) the board or committee adequately documented the basis for its determination, concurrently with making the decision.

The disqualified person or organization manager has the initial burden of proving that the compensation was reasonable. If the three criteria above are met, the burden of proof shifts to the IRS and the IRS must prove that the compensation was unreasonable. The IRS can rebut the presumption with sufficient contrary evidence showing the compensation was not reasonable or showing a transfer not to be at fair market value.

==Penalties==

The intermediate sanction provision goes on to create a penalty which is essentially a claw back of any benefits received plus a penalty as well as excise penalties that may be in excess of 200% of the benefit received. The organization must be returned to the state it was in, to the extent possible, before the person received the excess benefit. While the contract may be modified to prevent any excess benefit once any penalties are paid, organization managers may be liable for penalties up to $10,000 and held jointly and severally liable.

In order to prevent the IRS&#x27;s invocation of intermediate sanctions, any individual serving on the governing body of the organization may not have a conflict of interest regarding the transaction, and if they are on the governing body and have a conflict, they may answer questions posed by other members, but they must recuse themselves in the decision-making process, including debate.

<text>John Marlyn (April 2, 1912 – November 16, 2005) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Canadian writer who also used the pseudonym Vincent Reid when writing science fiction.

Marlyn was born in Nagybecskerek (Veliki Bečkerek), Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary (today Serbia) but grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, after arriving in Canada as an infant. During the depression-era 1930s, he found work as a script reader for a film studio in England. Just before World War II, he returned to Canada and worked as a writer for the Canadian government in Ottawa, Ontario. He also taught creative writing at Carleton University 1963–1967.

Marlyn received a Beta Sigma Phi award for his first novel, a tale of poor immigrant life during the 1920s, set in Winnipeg&#x27;s North End.

Marlyn&#x27;s papers were acquired by the University of Calgary in 1987.

He lived in the Canary Islands until he died of a heart attack.

Nobody ever makes fun of their names or calls them, &#x27;Baloney-eaters,&#x27; or laughs at the way they dress or talk.&quot; &quot;Nobody,&quot; he concluded bitterly, &quot;cause when you&#x27;re English it&#x27;s the same as being Canadian.&quot; —&quot;Under the Ribs of Death&quot;

<text>Argument to moderation ()—also known as the false compromise, argument from middle ground, fallacy of gray, middle ground fallacy, or [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] fallacy—is the fallacy that the truth is always in the middle of two opposites. 

It does not necessarily suggest that an argument for the middle solution or for a compromise is &quot;always&quot; fallacious, but rather applies primarily in cases where such a position is ill-informed, unfeasible, or impossible, or where an argument is incorrectly made that a position is correct simply &quot;because&quot; it is in the middle.

An example of an argument to moderation would be considering two statements about the colour of the sky on Earth during the dayone claiming, correctly, that the sky is blue, and another claiming that it is yellowand incorrectly concluding that the sky is the intermediate colour, green.

<text>Vinod Khosla (born 28 January 1955) is an Indian-American billionaire businessman and venture capitalist. He is a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and the founder of Khosla Ventures. Khosla made his wealth from early venture capital investments in areas such as networking, software, and alternative energy technologies. He is considered one of the most successful and influential venture capitalists. As of January 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at US$9.2 billion.

== Biography ==
Khosla was born on 28 January 1955, to a Punjabi Indian family in Pune, Maharashtra. Khosla&#x27;s father was an officer in the Indian Army and was posted at New Delhi, India. His father wanted him to also join the army. He attended Mount St Mary&#x27;s School for elementary school. Khosla became interested in entrepreneurship after reading about the founding of Intel in &quot;Electronic Engineering Times&quot; as a teenager, which led him to pursue technology as a career and found his own business. According to Khosla, he was inspired by Intel co-founder Andrew Grove, a Hungarian immigrant who got funding for Intel in Silicon Valley, when it was a startup.

From 1971 to 1976, Khosla attended IIT Delhi where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering. He started the first computer club in any IIT to do computer programming and operated the school&#x27;s computer center while the operations staff were on strike. He also wrote a paper on parallel processing as a teenager before the concept was adopted by the IT industry, and helped to start the first biomedical engineering program in India. In 1975, Khosla attempted to start a soy milk company intended to provide a milk alternative to Indian consumers that do not have refrigerators to preserve cow milk.

Khosla received a master&#x27;s in biomedical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University on a full scholarship. He applied to Stanford University&#x27;s MBA program but was rejected for lack of work experience. He had two full-time jobs while finishing his master&#x27;s for the two years of work experience, but was rejected a second time. Three weeks into starting at Carnegie Mellon for his MBA, Khosla convinced the admissions staff to accept him into Stanford Graduate School of Business and received an MBA in 1980.

He is married to Neeru Khosla, his childhood girlfriend. They have four children.

== Career ==
After completing his MBA at Stanford in 1980, Khosla decided to become an entrepreneur. He rejected several employment opportunities to establish his first business venture. 

=== Co-founding Sun Microsystems and early investments: 1980-2003 ===
Khosla developed a business plan for an electronic design automation company for electrical engineers. He was introduced to employees at Intel and became the first full-time founder and Chief Financial Officer of Daisy Systems. The company spent 80 percent of its resources on building custom computer hardware that could run its software. As a result, Khosla left the company in order to create a startup that manufactures general purpose computers. In 1981, Khosla co-founded Data Dump with a former Stanford classmate, which ended up failing.

In 1982, Khosla co-founded Sun Microsystems (SUN is the acronym for the Stanford University Network), along with Stanford classmates Andy Bechtolsheim, who was licensing a computer design to local companies, and Scott McNealy. UC Berkeley computer science graduate student Bill Joy later joined the company as co-founder. Sun Microsystems sold servers to the universities they graduated from and other colleges, desktop computers, and created the Java programming language. Khosla raised $300,000 in seed capital from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. Within five years, Sun made $1 billion in annual sales. Khosla also recruited early executives and developers such as Eric Schmidt and Carol Bartz. He served as the first chairman and CEO from 1982 to 1984, when he left the company to become a venture capitalist.

In 1986, Khosla joined the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins as a general partner. At Kleiner Perkins, Khosla managed investments in technologies, such as video games and semiconductors.

He helped create Nexgen, sold to AMD for 28 percent of its market cap, which was the first successful Intel microprocessor clone company. He invested in Go Corporation, which developed a stylus-operated computer and was seen as one of the largest Silicon Valley startup failures. In 1994, he suggested that Excite adapt its search engine for the internet and helped finance the special disk drive the company needed to run their search engine. He mentored the founders until the company was sold to @Home Network for $7 billion, which was it his first venture capital deal of that size. Afterwards, Khosla was an early proponent of fiber optics and the internet for faster communication and started focusing on telecommunication networking companies.

He incubated Juniper Networks and suggested that it develop an &quot;Internet router instead of the plain vanilla router mostly used.&quot; Khosla invested $275,000, which became his largest return on investment to date. A $3 million investment in Juniper Networks in the 1990s earned $7 billion for Kleiner Perkins according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He also incubated Cerent Corporation in 1996, which sold to Cisco for $7.8 billion, and Siara, which sold for $3 billion and was its chief executive officer for its first year.

=== Development of Khosla Ventures: 2004-present ===
In 2004 to spend more time with his teenage kids and focus on science-based technology startups, Khosla moved to part-time and eventually left Kleiner Perkins. He founded his own venture capital firm, Khosla Ventures later that year as a way to invest in more experimental technologies with a &quot;social impact.&quot; At the time, he had about $1.5 billion from co-founding Sun Microsystems and his work with Kleiner Perkins. The firm is based in Menlo Park, California.

In September 2009, Khosla Ventures III secured $750 million of investor commitments to invest in traditional early-stage and growth-stage companies. Khosla also raised $250 million for Khosla Seed, which will invest in higher-risk opportunities. He opened up Khosla Ventures to outside investors for the first time that same year. The firm became known for being an early investor in Square and investments in alternative energy technology like solar, biofuel, and batteries. He has advocated for breakthroughs in these &quot;clean&quot; energies rather than cutting back on energy consumption. The firm incubated carbon recycling and aviation fuel company LanzaTech and QuantumScape, a solid state battery company and Impossible Foods, which works to make meat a more efficient energy source. He believes carbon sequestration is an area that needs significant advancements and is the most feasible. Khosla believes that a dozen dramatic technologies to solve climate change and it is inaccurate to consider cleantech investing as a bust. By 2008, the company had a portfolio of 65 startups, the bulk of which were focused on clean technology.

Beginning in 2010, Khosla Ventures began investing in food and was the first investor in companies like Instacart and DoorDash. Fintech was also an area of focus with early investments in Square, Stripe and Affirm, which all resulted in large returns for Khosla Ventures. In May 2010, it was announced that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was to join Khosla Ventures to provide strategic advice regarding investments in technologies focused on the environment. During this time, Khosla had hired Condoleezza Rice&#x27;s advisory firm to work with portfolio companies.

In 2012, Khosla wrote an article titled &quot;Do We Need Doctors Or Algorithms?&quot; arguing the increasing importance of artificial intelligence in medicine claiming &quot;bionic assistance&quot; will eventually replace most doctors. He started investing in medicine and robotics, such as companies that use artificial intelligence in medical treatments at that time.

In 2018, Khosla stated the plan for the rest of his life was to &quot;reinvent societal infrastructure&quot; through innovation and technology such as 3D-printing houses for the homeless. Khosla has stated &quot;we need 1,000% change if billions of people in China and India are to enjoy a Western, energy-rich lifestyle.&quot; He invests in &quot;black swan&quot; technologies that have a high chance of failure but if successful, would have environmental and societal benefits. In 2019, Khosla presented &quot;Amazing: What KV Founders are Doing,&quot; which described 100 portfolio companies reinventing areas such as health, infrastructure, robotics, transportation, augmented reality and artificial intelligence.

Khosla Ventures was the first venture capital investor in OpenAI during a period when it was &quot;almost impossible to diligence&quot; due to the company&#x27;s corporate structure. The firm invested $50 million in OpenAI&#x27;s for-profit subsidiary in 2019. It had a 5 percent stake in OpenAI at that time.

Khosla offered personal loans to startups after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

In response to the removal of Sam Altman from OpenAI, Khosla expressed, on behalf of himself and Khosla Ventures, that Altman be reinstated. He later criticized Elon Musk for his breach of contract lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman, referring to it as &quot;sour grapes&quot; for failing to stay committed to the company.

Khosla Ventures manages approximately $15 billion of investor capital as well as investments funded by Khosla himself.

== Views ==
=== Capitalism ===
Khosla believes in using capitalism as a solution for social impact due to its ability to scale, which is something he does not believe is possible with non-profit organizations. He has insisted economical, large-scale solutions will succeed when facing global warming as well. Khosla has stated that machine learning technology will replace many jobs and increase income disparities however will also create enough GDP to provide basic income to everyone.

=== Politics ===
Khosla has donated to a mix of Democrats and Republicans and supports politicians based on their climate policies. He is a Democrat and has donated to organizations that support left-leaning politics. Khosla hosted Barack Obama for a fundraising dinner in 2013, and Joe Biden in 2024 at his home in Portola Valley. Khosla endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Khosla was a major proponent of the &quot;Yes on 87&quot; campaign to pass California&#x27;s Proposition 87, The Clean Energy Initiative, which failed to pass in November 2006.

With the withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 United States presidential election, Khosla called for the Democratic Party to hold an open convention for its nominee. He stated that it was &quot;hard for me to support someone with no values, lies, cheats, rapes, demeans women, hates immigrants like me&quot; in social media exchanges after Musk referenced supporting Donald Trump. Khosla pledged his support for Kamala Harris in July 2024 and joined &quot;VCs for Kamala&quot;, a group of more than 100 tech investors and entrepreneurs signatories for Harris.

===China===
In May 2023, Khosla gave a presentation examining how the Russian invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 pandemic influences the future. He argued that the Ukraine invasion started an energy transition and COVID-19 lockdowns in China moved global supply chains out of the country, starting one of the most powerful 20-year innovation cycles. Khosla has also stated that America is in a techno-economic war with China which it would lose upon slowing down the pace of AI development, while indicating that artificial general intelligence should be closed-source for national security.

In April 2024, Khosla wrote an op-ed in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; announcing his support of a bill that would force divestiture of TikTok from its parent company, ByteDance. Khosla later wrote an open letter to United States Senate urging them to pass the bill calling the social media platform a &quot;weapon of war&quot;.

===Artificial intelligence===
In 2014, Khosla wrote about artificial intelligence positing that it would create an income disparity while increasing gross domestic product (GDP) and productivity. He also stated that the value of &quot;humanness&quot; in occupational roles would become more valuable after the expansion of artificial intelligence, and have a &quot;hugely deflationary&quot; effect on the economy over the following 25 years.

While concerns have been raised that artificial intelligence will displace jobs, Khosla argued it will enable humans to do what they are interested in and free humanity from the need to work. He has stated that 80 percent of all jobs will be eliminated with artificial intelligence having broader information and expertise in many industries and its growth will allow for universal basic income.

In April 2024, Khosla gave a TED talk on his predictions for the future, several of which involved technology and artificial intelligence. In October 2024, Khosla wrote &quot;AI: Dystopia or Utopia?&quot; on it being a transformative force capable of creating a world of abundance with both utopian and dystopian possibilities and a positive outcome achievable through thoughtful design.

== Philanthropy and affiliations ==
Khosla was honorary chair of the DonorsChoose San Francisco Bay Area advisory board. In 2000, Khosla was a recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2006, Khosla&#x27;s wife Neeru co-founded the CK-12 Foundation, which aims to develop open-source textbooks and lower the cost of education in the US and the rest of the world. Khosla and his wife are donors to the Wikimedia Foundation, in the amount of $500,000.

In 2007, Khosla was an award recipient in the Northern California region for the EY Entrepreneur of the Year award. Khosla was a member of the board of trustees of the Blum Center for Developing Economies at the University of California, Berkeley. The center is focused on finding solutions to address the crisis of extreme poverty and disease in the developing world.

He is also one of the founders of TiE, The Indus Entrepreneurs, and has guest-edited a special issue of The Economic Times, a business newspaper in India. In 2009, he was awarded Champions of the Earth by the UNEP for in the Entrepreneurial Vision category for India.

He is involved with organizations that provide microfinancing to small businesses in third-world countries and worked closely with Muhammad Yunus funding multiple organizations for both profit and non-profit. In 2023, Khosla signed a letter along with over 170 global figures to stop the &quot;persecution&quot; of Yunus. Khosla is on the Board of Trustees at Carnegie Mellon University. Khosla was an early signatory to the Giving Pledge and sits on the Breakthrough Energy Ventures board.

In April 2021, Khosla made an offer to fund oxygen imports for hospitals in India amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

== Martins Beach dispute ==
Since 2010, Khosla has been engaged in a legal dispute regarding public access to Martins Beach, several miles south of Half Moon Bay, California, where he owns adjacent land. Martins Beach was a popular family beach and surf spot before Khosla purchased the property adjacent to the beach and blocked access with a gate, armed guards at the road entrance and painting over the welcome sign.

In August 2017, a Californian court of appeals ruled that Khosla must restore public access to Martins Beach. The plaintiffs stated that they expected Khosla to take the case to the US Supreme Court. In October 2018, the Supreme Court announced that it would not hear the appeal of the California appeals court decision. In November 2018, a San Mateo County court found that the prior owners of the property had not intended for access to Martins Beach to be public. In January 2020, the California Coastal Commission sued Khosla, alleging he was in violation of the California Coastal Act of 1976.

<text>, or are both terms referring to modern Japanese martial arts, which were established after the Meiji Restoration (1866–1869). Kobudō or koryū are the opposite of these terms referring to ancient martial arts established before the Meiji Restoration.

==Scope and tradition==
Any martial art created after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 is Gendai Budō. Koryō Budō are schools of budō that predate 1868. Some examples of Gendai budō are aikido, fuji ryu Goshendo ju-jitsu, gendai goshin ju jitsu, judo, karate, kūdō and shorinji kempo. The Japanese art of sumo is often defined as a gendai budō. This definition is incorrect as sumo is an ancient art that has attained popularity and media coverage in the modern era.

Gendai budō have origins in &quot;koryū&quot;, the traditional Japanese martial arts. For example, Kano Jigoro (嘉納 治五郎 &quot;Kanō Jigorō&quot;, 1860–1938) founded judo in part as an attempt to systematize the myriad traditions of ju-jitsu which existed at the time. Kendo similarly derives from the many schools of kenjutsu that evolved over the centuries.

==Organization of ranking system==
Koryū make no use of the popular &quot;kyu-dan&quot; ranking system. The gendai budō (modern budō forms), however, use the &quot;kyū-dan&quot; ranking system.

These rankings replaced the various certificates awarded within &quot;koryū&quot;. Gendai budō also generally do not contain the same strong entrance oaths and rituals as &quot;koryū&quot;, such as the &quot;keppan&quot; (&quot;blood oath&quot;). Whereas in most gendai budō dojo all are welcome provided they follow basic rules of conduct, &quot;koryū&quot; instructors often strictly scrutinize candidates. The primary purpose of gendai budō is for spiritual and mental development through the study and application of East Asian metaphysical techniques and teachings.

<text>The Fiesta Bowl is an annual American college football bowl game played annually in the Phoenix metropolitan area since 1971. 

From its beginning until 2006, the game was hosted at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. Since 2007, the game has been played at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Since 2022, it has been sponsored by Vrbo and officially known as the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl. Previous sponsors include PlayStation (December 2016–2022), BattleFrog (January 2016), Vizio (December 2014), Tostitos (1996–January 2014), IBM (1993–1995) and Sunkist (1986–1990).

Unlike other major bowls, the Fiesta Bowl has not always had major conference tie-ins. For the first nine editions, the Western Athletic Conference champion was invited to the bowl. In 1997, the Fiesta Bowl agreed to invite the champion of the newly-formed Big 12 Conference; the tie in would continue until 2014 when the Big 12 tie-in moved to the Sugar Bowl. During the late 1980s, the Fiesta Bowl used its lack of tie-ins to create two &quot;de facto&quot; national championship games between independents or teams from conferences without mandatory bowl obligations. These national championship games increased the Fiesta Bowl&#x27;s stature among bowl games.

Beginning in 1992, the Fiesta Bowl joined with several other bowls to create the Bowl Coalition in an effort to produce an undisputed national champion in college football. It would subsequently participate in the Bowl Alliance and Bowl Championship Series. From 1992 to 2006, the Orange Bowl served as the national championship game of these systems in 1996, 1999, and 2002. The Phoenix metropolitan area and the Fiesta Bowl Committee hosted the BCS National Championship Game in 2007 and 2011 in addition to the regular Fiesta Bowl game.

In 2014, the Fiesta Bowl, along with the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot; bowls, became a part of the College Football Playoff. As part of the four team playoff from 2014 to 2023, the Orange Bowl served as a semifinal game in 2016, 2019, and 2022.

With the expansion of the College Football Playoff to twelve teams in the 2024–25 season, the Fiesta Bowl will serve as either a quarterfinal or semifinal each year. It served as a quarterfinal for the 2024 season and will serve as a semifinal for the 2025 season. When serving as a semifinal, the game will be played one week after New Year&#x27;s Day. 

The Fiesta Bowl has donated over $12 million to charity. In 2020, it donated $1 million in emergency relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. Jim Barnett has been the public address announcer at the Fiesta Bowl since the game moved to Glendale in 2007, and, in his capacity as PA announcer at State Farm Stadium, has served as the pregame announcer of Super Bowls XLII, XLIX and LVII

==History==
===Origins===

The Fiesta Bowl was born from the Western Athletic Conference&#x27;s frustrated attempts to obtain bowl invitations for its champions. In 1968 and 1969 respectively, champions Wyoming and Arizona State failed to secure any bowl selection. The next year, undefeated Arizona State was bypassed by the major bowls and had to settle for an appearance in the less prestigious Peach Bowl. The Fiesta Bowl therefore initially provided an automatic berth for the WAC champion.

===1970s===
In its first decade of existence, the Fiesta Bowl was played in the last week of December (including the afternoon of Christmas Day from 1976 to 1979). The 1971 inaugural game featured another top-ten Arizona State squad against top-twenty opponent Florida State. The 1974 game featured WAC champ BYU and their new coach, future Hall of Fame member LaVell Edwards in their first-ever bowl game vs. Oklahoma State. BYU was in control until BYU&#x27;s first All-American quarterback Gary Sheide went down with a leg injury and eventually lost 16–6. By 1975, the game was able to attract Big Eight co-champion Nebraska to play undefeated Arizona State in a matchup of top-five teams. In 1977, the game was again able to attract a top-five opponent in Penn State, despite WAC champion #16 BYU refusing to play in the bowl due to its being held on Sunday.

In 1978, Arizona and Arizona State both joined the Pac-10 Conference and the Fiesta Bowl&#x27;s tie-in with the WAC ended, so its champ went to the newly inaugurated Holiday Bowl. From then until the advent of the Bowl Coalition in 1992, Fiesta Bowl matchups typically featured runners-up of major conferences and/or major independents.

===1980s===
The game continued to attract high quality matchups. Beginning with the 1981 season, it shifted to New Year&#x27;s Day alongside the major bowl games—the Cotton, Orange, Sugar, and Rose. At the time, NBC had the broadcast rights to the Fiesta, Rose, and Orange; the Fiesta was played first and had a late morning kickoff (11:30 a.m. MST). It was the first bowl game to acquire a corporate title sponsor, via an agreement with Sunkist Growers in September 1985, making the game the &quot;Sunkist Fiesta Bowl&quot; starting with the January 1986 edition. The Tangerine Bowl had previously reached agreement in March 1983 with the Florida Citrus Commission, a state government agency, to rename itself as the Florida Citrus Bowl.

A major breakthrough occurred after the 1986 season when the top two teams in the country, Miami and Penn State, agreed to play for the &quot;de facto&quot; national championship in the Fiesta Bowl. At the time, the traditional four &quot;major&quot; bowl games granted automatic bids to their conference champions. Both Miami and Penn State were independents at that time, and were thus free to choose a bowl. As such, the Fiesta Bowl and the Florida Citrus Bowl, each free from the obligation of conference tie-ins, vied to host the Miami–Penn State matchup in order to ensure that they would meet on the field. The Fiesta Bowl won the bidding and the game was set to be played on Friday, January 2, 1987—the night after the &quot;big four&quot; bowls of New Year&#x27;s Day. Penn State won and the game drew the largest television audience in the history of college football at the time. Two years later, #1 Notre Dame played undefeated #3 West Virginia for the national championship at the 1989 Fiesta Bowl on January 1.

The 1987 and 1989 games were two of four straight matchups of teams ranked in the AP Top 10 going into the bowl season to close out the 1980s. This significantly increased the Fiesta Bowl&#x27;s prestige, to the point that it was now considered a major bowl by many fans and pundits. The 1988 game returned to New Year&#x27;s Day, and the 1989 game kicked off three hours later (2:30 p.m. MST on NBC) and opposite the Rose Bowl, which had switched networks to ABC.

===1990s===
Before the 1991 game, several major universities declined invitations due to the State of Arizona&#x27;s decision at that time not to adopt the Martin Luther King Holiday. However, in 1992, the Fiesta Bowl was invited to participate in the Bowl Coalition, a predecessor to the Bowl Championship Series. This assured the game would feature major conference champions or prestigious runners-up and cemented its status as a major bowl. Had the two top-ranked teams in the Bowl Coalition not come from the SEC, Big Eight or SWC, the Fiesta Bowl would have hosted the Bowl Coalition&#x27;s &quot;national championship game,&quot; though this never happened during the three years of the Bowl Coalition&#x27;s run.

When the Bowl Coalition was reconfigured as the Bowl Alliance for the 1995 season, the Fiesta was included as one of the three top games. In that season, it hosted the Bowl Alliance National Championship game featuring undefeated #1 Nebraska playing undefeated #2 Florida for the national championship. Nebraska won the game 62–24, the largest win margin in the history of the national championship game, and the most points ever scored in a national championship game. Finally, with the addition of the Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences to the new Bowl Championship Series, the Fiesta Bowl became a permanent fixture in the four-year BCS National Championship Game rotation. In 1998, the Fiesta Bowl featured the first BCS National Championship Game, which Tennessee won over Florida State, 23–16.

Starting with the 1999 season, the Big 12 Conference champion received an automatic bid to the Fiesta Bowl in years when it was not slated as the BCS title game, an arrangement that continued to the end of the BCS era.

===2000s===
In 2002, the Fiesta Bowl had the right to take the Pac-10 Conference Champion, should that team not reach the Rose Bowl, which served as the national championship game that season. Oregon failed to qualify for the championship game, and thus played Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl. A similar arrangement was made for the 2006 Fiesta Bowl. However, instead of gaining the Pac-10 Conference champion in addition to their usual tie-in with the Big 12, the Fiesta Bowl would have had a choice of the two teams. This turned out to be a moot point as both the Big 12 champion Texas and Pac-10 champion Southern California qualified for the National Championship Game (USC&#x27;s participation has since been vacated).

The BCS National Championship game returned to the Fiesta Bowl in 2003 with the Big Ten champions Ohio State Buckeyes beating the Big East champions Miami Hurricanes in the first overtime national championship game. The game went into double overtime with the Buckeyes coming out on top 31–24 to claim the 2002 national championship.

The Fiesta Bowl was the first BCS bowl to have had a team from outside the automatic qualifying (AQ) BCS conferences (the Big 12, Big Ten, Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Southeastern Conference (SEC), Pac-10, Big East, and Notre Dame). The 2005 game saw undefeated Utah from the Mountain West Conference become the first BCS non-AQ school ever to play in a BCS game, easily defeating Big East champion Pittsburgh 35–7.

In 2007, the Fiesta Bowl game was played for the first time at the new then-named University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, across the Phoenix metropolitan area from Sun Devil Stadium. The undefeated Boise State Broncos won by defeating the Oklahoma Sooners 43–42 in overtime. It has been called one of the greatest college football games ever played, due to the combination of an underdog team, trick plays, comebacks by each team, and a thrilling overtime finish.

===2010s===
The 2010 Fiesta Bowl featured #6 Boise State defeating #4 TCU, 17–10. It was the first time a BCS bowl matched-up two non-automatic qualifying teams (i.e. two teams from conferences without automatic BCS bids) and the first time that two teams who went undefeated faced each other in a BCS game outside of the national championship. In the 2012 Fiesta Bowl, Oklahoma State defeated Stanford 41–38. Notable players included Brandon Weeden and Justin Blackmon for Oklahoma State, and Andrew Luck for Stanford.

In November 2016, PlayStation was announced as the bowl&#x27;s new title sponsor.

The December 2016, December 2019, and December 2022 editions served as a semifinal for the College Football Playoff. The Fiesta Bowl will host a semifinal, alongside the Peach Bowl, again in 2025 and 2028.

=== 2020s ===
The 50th edition of the Fiesta Bowl featured #10 Iowa State defeating #25 Oregon Ducks 34-17. The game was behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Arizona, with only player&#x27;s family members admitted. In the 2022 Fiesta Bowl, Oklahoma State rallied from a 28-7 deficit late in the 2nd quarter to defeat Notre Dame 37-35. In the December edition of that game (which was also a CFP semifinal), #3 TCU defeated #2 Michigan 51-45, the highest scoring game in Fiesta Bowl history, and the second-highest scoring CFP semifinal game.

==Controversies==

===Invitations===
In 1996, a group of students from Brigham Young University, led by BYU professor Dennis Martin, burned bags of Tostitos tortilla chips in a bonfire and called for a boycott of all Tostitos products. This came after #5 ranked BYU was not invited to play in the 1997 Fiesta Bowl in favor of #7 ranked Penn State. This event is one of those referred to by proponents of college football implementing a playoff series rather than the controversial Bowl Alliance.
Penn State went on to win the game over #20 Texas, 38–15, while BYU defeated #14 Kansas State in the Cotton Bowl Classic, 19–15.

For the 2010 Fiesta Bowl, the selections of TCU and Boise State caused a great deal of controversy. For the first and only time in the BCS era, two BCS non-AQ teams were chosen to play in BCS bowls in the same bowl season: however, they ended up facing each other in this bowl. Because the two non-AQ teams were placed in the same bowl game, the bowl was derisively referred to as the &quot;Separate But Equal Bowl&quot;, the &quot;Quarantine Bowl&quot;, the &quot;Fiasco Bowl&quot;, the &quot;BCS Kids&#x27; Table&quot;, etc. Some had called for a boycott because of this arrangement. There was wide speculation that the BCS bowl selection committees maneuvered TCU and Boise State into the same bowl so as to deny them the chances to &quot;embarrass&quot; two AQ conference representatives in separate bowls, as Boise State had done in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl and Utah had done in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl and 2009 Sugar Bowl (prior to the game, non-AQ teams were 3–1 versus AQ teams in BCS bowls). In response, Fiesta Bowl CEO John Junker called those allegations &quot;the biggest load of crap that I&#x27;ve ever heard in my life&quot; and said that &quot;We&#x27;re in the business of doing things that are on behalf of our bowl game and we don&#x27;t do the bidding of someone else to our detriment.&quot; Beyond the unappealing nature of a major bowl contest with two programs then perceived as underdogs, the appeal was further diminished as it was a rematch of the 2008 Poinsettia Bowl from the previous bowl season.

===Financial scandals===
In 2009, in the weeks prior to the 2010 Fiesta Bowl, past and present Fiesta Bowl employees alleged that they were encouraged to help maintain its position as one of the four BCS bowls by making campaign contributions to politicians friendly to the Fiesta Bowl, with those contributions subsequently reimbursed to the employees. If the allegations were true, this would have been a violation of both state and federal campaign finance laws. Furthermore, as a non-profit organization, the Fiesta Bowl is prohibited from making political contributions of any kind. The Fiesta Bowl commissioned an &quot;independent review&quot; which found &quot;no credible evidence that the bowl&#x27;s management engaged in any type of illegal or unethical conduct.&quot;

The following year, in a November 2010 article, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that Fiesta Bowl officials, including bowl CEO John Junker, spent $4 million since 2000 to curry favor from BCS bigwigs and elected officials, including a 2008 &quot;Fiesta Frolic&quot;, a golf-centered gathering of athletic directors and head coaches. The journal also reported that Junker&#x27;s annual salary was close to $600,000 and that the bowl, in 2007 turned an $11.6 million profit. While these alleged activities are not illegal, they did result in considerable damage to the reputation of the Fiesta Bowl.

On March 29, 2011, the Fiesta Bowl Board of Directors released a 276-page &quot;scathing internal report&quot;, commissioned by them to re-examine the accusations of illegal political activities. The commission determined that $46,539 of illegal campaign contributions were made and the board immediately fired Fiesta Bowl CEO John Junker, who had already been suspended pending the results of this investigation. The scandal threatened the Fiesta Bowl&#x27;s status as a BCS game, as the BCS said it might replace the bowl in its lineup if officials could not convince them it should remain. The BCS ultimately chose not to expel the Fiesta Bowl, instead fining the organization $1 million.

In June 2011 University of Arizona president Robert Shelton was hired to replace Junker. On February 22, 2012, former CEO John Junker pleaded guilty to a federal felony charge in the campaign financing matter, and two members of his former staff pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges. Junker was to be sentenced soon after, facing up to 2.5 years in prison as the result of his plea, but his sentencing was repeatedly postponed in return for cooperation in other cases. On March 13, 2014, Junker was sentenced to eight months in prison, with the sentence starting on June 13, 2014; he was released on February 11, 2015. On March 20, 2014, Junker was sentenced to three years of probation on state charges.

==Parade==
One of the Fiesta Bowl events, the annual Fiesta Bowl Parade, takes place in downtown Phoenix. It features marching bands from high schools as well as the two universities participating in the Fiesta Bowl, and the two universities participating in the Cactus Bowl, along with floats, equestrian units, and a seven-member queen and court. The parade began in 1973. Grand Marshals include celebrities from sports and entertainment.

In 2018, the sponsor was changed from Bank of Arizona to Desert Financial. Appearances in the 2018 parade included Cindy McCain and the marching band from Salem High School in Salem, New Hampshire, which was the group that had traveled the farthest for the parade.

As of the 2010–11 season, the game along with the rest of the BCS and its successor, the College Football Playoff, exclusively airs on ESPN. From 2007 through 2010, Fox telecast the game along with the other BCS games – the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and BCS National Championship Game from 2006 though 2009, while only the Rose Bowl and the 2010 BCS National Championship Game aired on ABC in that period. From 1999 to 2006, the game aired on ABC as part of the first BCS package, and from 1996 to 1998 the game aired on CBS as part of its bowl coverage. Prior to that, NBC aired the game for several years. This game, along with the Orange Bowl, is one of only two bowl games ever to air on all the &quot;Big 4&quot; broadcast television networks in the United States.

ESPN Radio is the current radio home for the Fiesta Bowl.

In 2013, ESPN Deportes provided the first Spanish U.S. telecast of the Fiesta Bowl.

<text>The Bodhi Tree (&quot;tree of awakening&quot; or &quot;tree of enlightenment&quot;), also called the Bo tree, was a large sacred fig tree (&quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;) located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India. Siddhartha Gautama, the spiritual teacher who became known as the Buddha, is said to have attained enlightenment, or buddhahood, circa 500 BCE, under that tree. In religious iconography, the Bodhi tree is recognizable by its heart-shaped leaves, which are usually prominently displayed.

The original tree under which Siddhartha Gautama sat is no longer living, but the term &quot;bodhi tree&quot; is also applied to existing sacred fig trees. The foremost example is the Mahabodhi tree growing at the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, which is often cited as a direct descendant of the original tree. This tree, planted around 250 BCE, is a frequent destination for pilgrims, being the most important of the four main Buddhist pilgrimage sites. The tree&#x27;s leaves can be bought by pilgrims as mementos.

Other holy bodhi trees with great significance in the history of Buddhism are the Anandabodhi tree at Jetavana near Sravasti, Uttar Pradesh, in northern India, and the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.

==Origin and descendants==
===Bodh Gaya===

The Bodhi Tree at the Mahabodhi Temple is called &quot;Sri Maha Bodhi&quot;. Gautama Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment (&quot;bodhi&quot;) while meditating underneath a &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;. According to Buddhist texts, the Buddha meditated without moving from his seat for seven weeks (49 days) under this tree. A shrine called &quot;Animisalocana cetiya&quot; was later erected on the spot where he sat.

The spot was used as a shrine even in the Buddha&#x27;s lifetime. Emperor Ashoka paid homage to the Bodhi Tree and held a festival every year in its honour in the month of Kattika. His queen, Tissarakkhā, was jealous of the tree, and three years after she became queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Ashoka&#x27;s reign), she cursed it to be killed by means of thorns. The tree, however, grew again, and a monastery was attached to the Bodhimaṇḍa, called Bodhimanda Vihara. Every time the tree was destroyed, a new one was planted in the same place.

In 1862, the British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham wrote of the site as the first entry in the first volume published by the Archaeological Survey of India:

The celebrated Bodhi tree still exists, but is very much decayed; one large stem, with three branches to the westward, is still green, but the other branches are barkless and rotten. The green branch perhaps belongs to some younger tree, as there are numerous stems of apparently different trees clustered together. The tree must have been renewed frequently, as the present Pipal is standing on a terrace at least 30 feet above the level of the surrounding country. It was in full vigour in 1811, when seen by Dr. Buchanan (Hamilton), who describes it as in all probability not exceeding 100 years of age.

However, the tree decayed further, and in 1876, what remained of it was destroyed in a storm. Cunningham wrote that the young scion of the parent tree was already in existence to take its place.

Since 2007, the Forest Research Institute of India has assisted in the upkeep of the Mahabodhi tree. Various measures have been taken to protect the tree&#x27;s health of the tree, and cloning was considered in 2008. 

===Jetavana, Uttar Pradesh===

It is said that in the ancient Buddhist texts, in order for people to make offerings in the name of the Buddha when he was away on pilgrimage, the Buddha sanctioned the planting of a seed from the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya in front of the gateway of Jetavana Monastery, near Sravasti. For this purpose, Moggallana took a fruit from the tree as it dropped from its stalk, before it reached the ground. It was planted in a golden jar by Anathapindika, with great pomp and ceremony. A sapling immediately sprouted forth, fifty cubits high, and in order to consecrate it, the Buddha spent one night under it in meditation. This tree, because it was planted under the direction of Ananda, came to be known as the Ananda Bodhi.

===Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka===
King Ashoka&#x27;s daughter Sanghamittā Theri brought a piece of the tree with her to Ceylon, where it continues to grow in the island&#x27;s ancient capital of Anuradhapura. It is named Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi. According to the &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot;, Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi was planted in 288 BCE, making it the oldest verified specimen of any angiosperm. In this year (the twelfth year of King Ashoka&#x27;s reign), the right branch of the Bodhi Tree was brought by Sanghamittā to Anurādhapura and placed by the left foot of Devanampiya Tissa. The Buddha, on his deathbed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch to be taken to Ceylon should detach itself. From Bodh Gayā, the branch was taken to Pātaliputta and thence to Tāmalittī, where it was placed on a ship and taken across the sea. It finally arrived at Anuradhapura, staying on the way at Tivakka.

===Honolulu, Hawaii===
In 1913, Anagarika Dharmapala took a sapling of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi to Hawaii, where he presented it to his benefactor, Mary E. Foster, who had funded much Buddhist missionary work. She planted it in the grounds of her house in Honolulu, by the Nuʻuanu stream. On her death, she left her house and its grounds to the people of Honolulu, and it became the Foster Botanical Garden.

===Chennai, India===
In 1950, Jinarajadasa took three saplings of the Sri Maha Bodhi to plant two in Chennai, India: one near the Buddhist temple at the Theosophical Society and the other at the riverside of Adyar Creek. The third sapling was planted near a meditation center in Sri Lanka.

===Trấn Quốc, Hanoi, Vietnam===
In 1959, to mark a visit to Vietnam by the first president of India, Rajendra Prasad, a cutting of the original tree in Bodh Gaya was gifted, and it presently stands on the grounds of Trấn Quốc Pagoda in Hanoi.

===Thousand Oaks, California===
In 2012, the Bangladeshi philanthropist Brahmanda Pratap Barua took a sapling of the Bodhi Tree from Bodh Gaya, to Thousand Oaks, California, where he presented it to his benefactor, Anagarika Glenn Hughes, who had funded much Buddhist work and teaches Buddhism in the United States.

===Nihon-ji, Japan===
In 1989, the government of India presented the temple of Nihon-ji with a sapling from the Bodhi Tree as a gesture of world peace.

===Deekshabhoomi, Nagpur, India===
A Bodhi tree was planted at the Deekshabhoomi Buddhist monument in Nagpur, India, from three branches of the Bodhi Tree at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan brought the branches from Sri Lanka as a memorial of Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment. The site is holy to Navayana Buddhism, as it is the place where the Indian political leader B. R. Ambedkar converted to Buddhism, along with 600,000 followers, on 14 October 1956, during the Dhammachakra Pravartan Din festival.

===Quezon City, Philippines===
A sapling of the Bodhi Tree from Anuradhapura was planted on 15 May 2011 at Wisdom Park in New Manila, Quezon City, Philippines, by D. M. Jayaratne, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, and Mariano S. Yupitun, founder of Universal Wisdom Foundation Inc.

===Bendigo, Victoria, Australia===
A sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree was sent in 2022 to the Great Stupa of Universal Compassion, the largest stupa in the Western world, near Bendigo in central Victoria, Australia.

===Brisbane, Queensland, Australia===
A sapling of the Bodhi tree from Anuradhapura was planted in April 2008 at Kurilpa Point, the site of the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, by the artist Lee Mingwei, as the centerpiece to his &quot;Bhodi Tree Project&quot;.

===Brazil===
There are two descendants of the Bodhi Tree in Brazil: one in the Busshinji temple, the head temple of Sōtō in Latin America, in São Paulo, and another in the Sōtō temple Daissenji, in Florianópolis.

===South Korea===
A sapling from the Mahabodhi tree in Bodh Gaya was given to South Korea in 2022 as a symbol of friendship between the two countries. It was planned to eventually be planted at a Buddhist temple.

===Mahabodhi trees of other Buddhas===
Following is a list of the various Mahabodhi trees under which all of the Buddhas known to Theravada Buddhism attained buddhahood:

==Bodhi Day==
On 8 December, Bodhi Day celebrates Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment underneath the Bodhi Tree. Those who follow the Dharma greet each other by saying, &quot;Budu saranai!&quot;, which translates to &quot;may the peace of the Buddha be yours&quot;. It is generally seen as a religious holiday, much like Christmas in the Christian West, in which special meals are served, especially cookies shaped like hearts (referencing the heart-shaped leaves of the Bodhi) and kheer, the Buddha&#x27;s first meal ending his six-year asceticism.

==Bodhi Tree and Bihar emblem==
The Bodhi tree is the main part of the Bihar state emblem. During British rule, the State Reorganisation Act of 1935 adopted the Bodhi Tree as the state emblem, following a recommendation to that effect being forwarded to the Royal Society.

==&quot;Bodhi puja&quot;==
&quot;Bodhi puja&quot;, meaning &quot;veneration of the Bodhi tree&quot;, is a ritual to worship the Bodhi Tree and the deity residing in it (Pali: &quot;rukkhadevata&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;vrikshadevata&quot;).

<text>Robert Wolfe Quine (December 30, 1942 – May 31, 2004) was an American guitarist. A native of Akron, Ohio, Quine worked with a wide range of musicians, though he himself remained relatively unknown. Critic Mark Deming wrote that &quot;Quine&#x27;s eclectic style embraced influences from jazz, rock, and blues players of all stripes, and his thoughtful technique and uncompromising approach led to rewarding collaborations with a number of visionary musicians.&quot;

His collaborators included Richard Hell &amp; the Voidoids, Lou Reed (notably on &quot;The Blue Mask&quot;), Brian Eno, John Zorn, Ikue Mori, Marc Ribot, Marianne Faithfull (&quot;Strange Weather&quot;), Lloyd Cole, Matthew Sweet and Tom Waits.

Lester Bangs wrote that he was a &quot;pivotal figure&quot; and &quot;the first guitarist to take the breakthroughs of early Lou Reed and James Williamson and work through them to a new, individual vocabulary, driven into odd places by obsessive attention to &quot;On the Corner&quot;-era Miles Davis.&quot; Quine was ranked 80th by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Fricke in his list of &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists&quot;.

==Early life==
Quine was born in Akron, Ohio, the son of Rosalie (née Cohen) and Robert Cloyd Quine. He was a nephew of philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine. After graduating from Earlham College in 1965, Quine earned a law degree &quot;out of inertia&quot; from Washington University in St. Louis in 1968. Although he never practiced law and failed the California bar exam on several occasions, Quine wrote tax law textbooks for Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey–based publisher Prentice Hall for three years after moving to New York City in 1971 by virtue of his admission to the Missouri bar in 1969. Quine also enrolled at the Berklee School of Music at an indeterminate point without taking a degree.

==Career==
In 1969, Quine made a series of cassette recordings of the Velvet Underground performing live in St. Louis and San Francisco, where he lived between late 1969 and 1971. These saw official release in 2001 by Polydor Records, titled &quot;Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes&quot;. In the liner notes, Quine writes: &quot;I got a lot of pleasure and inspiration from these performances. As a guitar player, they were an important element in shaping what musical direction I wanted to take.&quot; While in St. Louis, he performed in a band called Bruce&#x27;s Farm that specialized in Byrds covers.

Throughout his San Francisco years (coinciding with his attempts to pass the California bar exam), Quine &quot;sort of began to come up with my own style,&quot; often performing under the influence of LSD; nevertheless, he disdained such psychedelic rock groups as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. During this period, his influences included John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Ascension&quot; (1966), Elvis Presley&#x27;s singles for Sun Records, Fats Domino, Bo Diddley, James Burton, Mickey Baker and Little Richard. Upon moving to New York, he began to gravitate toward a new array of influences, including the 1972-1975 electric oeuvre of Miles Davis (especially the guitar sounds on 1972&#x27;s &quot;On the Corner&quot; and 1975&#x27;s &quot;Agharta&quot;), The Stooges&#x27; &quot;Raw Power&quot; (1973) and Brian Eno.

After leaving Prentice Hall to focus on his musical career in the mid-1970s, he worked at the Greenwich Village bookstore Cinemabilia with Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine, the co-founders of the influential punk band Television. Later, Hell invited him to join his new band The Voidoids. Hell&#x27;s two Voidoid albums feature Quine&#x27;s distinctive guitar work; guitarist Marc Ribot once said about Quine that &quot;in terms of punk rock guitar soloing, [Quine] could definitely be called the inventor,&quot; while critic Ira Robbins describes his work as &quot;stunning and underrated&quot;.

After The Voidoids broke up, Quine recorded with Lydia Lunch, Jody Harris and Material. From September 1979 to July 1980, Quine and Harris recorded various guitar improvisations with a drum machine. In 1981, some of those experiments were released as the Harris/Quine album, &quot;Escape&quot;. With Material bandmate Fred Maher, Quine recorded his only other solo album, &quot;Basic&quot;, released in 1984.

In the early 1980s, Lou Reed drafted Quine to join his group. He appeared on &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; (1982), widely regarded as one of Reed&#x27;s best albums. The Reed-Quine guitar work crafted interlocking duels that blur the lines between rhythm and leads. Reed&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Legendary Hearts&quot; featured most of the same group, but Quine eventually quit due to tensions with Reed, exacerbated when Reed mixed down or entirely removed most of Quine&#x27;s guitar parts on &quot;Legendary Hearts&quot;. Quine claimed that when he got his advance copy of the album, he was so disgusted by this, he smashed the cassette into &quot;smithereens&quot; with a hammer. Reed persuaded Quine to rejoin for a world tour, which is documented on the video &quot;A Night with Lou Reed&quot; (1983) and the album &quot;Live in Italy&quot; (1984); Quine disliked touring, but agreed to the tour for financial reasons. He ended his partnership with Reed for good in 1984.

Although Quine frequently collaborated with Eno from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s (coinciding with the producer&#x27;s residency in New York), &quot;almost none of [their work] ever came out.&quot; In a 1997 interview with &quot;Perfect Sound Forever&quot;, he claimed to have introduced Eno to &quot;He Loved Him Madly,&quot; a thirty-two minute 1974 Miles Davis song that Eno has cited as a pivotal influence in his development of ambient music.

Throughout the 1980s, Quine made appearances as a session player on records by Tom Waits, John Zorn, Marianne Faithfull and Scritti Politti. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Quine began collaborations with a few musicians who would introduce him to new audiences, and who would raise his profile a bit. Saxophonist/composer John Zorn hired Quine for several experimental projects. He appeared on They Might Be Giants&#x27; 1994 album &quot;John Henry&quot;, and he also worked with pop songwriters/singers Lloyd Cole and Matthew Sweet during this period. Sweet&#x27;s biggest hit song, &quot;Girlfriend,&quot; is anchored by Quine&#x27;s frenetic, squealing guitar work.

==Death==
After the death of his wife Alice in August 2003, Quine died by suicide due to a heroin overdose in his New York home on May 31, 2004.

<text>The Times of India (TOI) is an Indian English-language daily newspaper and digital news media owned and managed by The Times Group. It is the fourth-largest newspaper in India by circulation and largest selling English-language daily in the world. It is the oldest English-language newspaper in India, and the second-oldest Indian newspaper still in circulation, with its first edition published in 1838. It is nicknamed as &quot;The Old Lady of Bori Bunder&quot;, and is a &quot;newspaper of record&quot;.

Near the beginning of the 20th century, Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, called &quot;TOI&quot; &quot;the leading paper in Asia&quot;. In 1991, the BBC ranked &quot;TOI&quot; among the world&#x27;s six best newspapers.

It is owned and published by Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd. (B.C.C.L.), which is owned by the Sahu Jain family. In the Brand Trust Report India study 2019, &quot;TOI&quot; was rated as the most trusted English newspaper in India. In a 2021 survey, Reuters Institute rated &quot;TOI&quot; as the most trusted media news brand among English-speaking, online news users in India. In recent decades, the newspaper has been criticised for establishing in the Indian news industry the practice of accepting payments from persons and entities in exchange for positive coverage.

==History==
===1800s===
====Beginnings====

&quot;TOI&quot; issued its first edition on 3 November 1838 as The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce. The paper was published on Wednesdays and Saturdays under the direction of Raobahadur Narayan Dinanath Velkar, a Maharashtrian social reformer, and contained news from Britain and the world, as well as the Indian Subcontinent. J. E. Brennan was its first editor he died in 1839 and George Buist became the Editor. It became a daily in 1850 under him. George Buist had a pro British editorial policy and a Parsi shareholder Fardoonji Naoroji wanted him to change his editorial policy particularly in background of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. However, Buist refused to change his editorial policy or give up his editorial independence. After a shareholder&#x27;s meeting he was replaced by Robert Knight.

In 1860, editor Robert Knight (1825–1892) bought the Indian shareholders&#x27; interests, merged with rival &quot;Bombay Standard&quot;, and started India&#x27;s first news agency. It wired &quot;Times&quot; dispatches to papers across the country and became the Indian agent for Reuters news service. In 1861, he changed the name from the Bombay &quot;Times and Standard&quot; to &quot;The Times of India&quot;. Knight fought for a press free of prior restraint or intimidation, frequently resisting the attempts by governments, business interests and cultural spokesmen, and led the paper to national prominence. In the 19th century, this newspaper company employed more than 800 people and had a sizeable circulation in India and Europe.

====Bennett and Coleman ownership====

Subsequently, &quot;TOI&quot; saw its ownership change several times until 1892 when an English journalist named Thomas Jewell Bennett, along with Frank Morris Coleman (who later drowned in the 1915 sinking of the SS &quot;Persia&quot;), acquired the newspaper through their new joint stock company, &quot;Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd&quot;.

===1900s===
====Dalmia ownership====
Sir Stanley Reed edited &quot;TOI&quot; from 1907 until 1924 and received correspondence from major figures of India such as Mahatma Gandhi. In all he lived in India for fifty years. He was respected in the United Kingdom as an expert on Indian current affairs.

Bennett Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd was sold to sugar magnate Ramkrishna Dalmia of the industrial family, for in 1946, as India became independent and the British owners left. In 1955 the Vivian Bose Commission of Inquiry found that Ramkrishna Dalmia, in 1947, had engineered the acquisition of the media giant Bennett Coleman &amp; Co. by transferring money from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the chairman. In the court case that followed, Ramkrishna Dalmia was sentenced to two years in Tihar Jail after having been convicted of embezzlement and fraud.

Most of the jail term he managed to spend in hospital. Upon his release, his son-in-law, Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain, to whom he had entrusted the running of Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd., rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company.

====Jain family (Shanti Prasad Jain)====
In the early 1960s, Shanti Prasad Jain was imprisoned on charges of selling newsprint on the black market. And based on the Vivian Bose Commission&#x27;s earlier report which found wrongdoings of the Dalmia – Jain group, that included specific charges against Shanti Prasad Jain, the Government of India filed a petition to restrain and remove the management of Bennett, Coleman and Company. Based on the pleading, the Justice directed the Government to assume control of the newspaper which resulted in replacing half of the directors and appointing a Bombay High Court judge as the chairman.

====Under the Government of India====
Following the Vivian Bose Commission report indicating serious wrongdoings of the Dalmia–Jain group, on 28 August 1969, the Bombay High Court, under Justice J. L. Nain, passed an interim order to disband the existing board of Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co and to constitute a new board under the Government. The bench ruled that &quot;Under these circumstances, the best thing would be to pass such orders on the assumption that the allegations made by the petitioners that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest and to the interests of the Company are correct&quot;. Following that order, Shanti Prasad Jain ceased to be a director and the company ran with new directors on board, appointed by the Government of India, with the exception of a lone stenographer of the Jains. The court appointed D K Kunte as chairman of the board. Kunte had no prior business experience and was also an opposition member of the Lok Sabha.

====Back to the Jain family====
In 1976, during the Emergency in India, the Government transferred ownership of the newspaper back to Ashok Kumar Jain, who was Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain&#x27;s son and Ramkrishna Dalmia&#x27;s grandson. He is the father of the current owners Samir Jain and Vineet Jain). The Jains too often landed themselves in various money laundering scams and Ashok Kumar Jain had to flee the country when the Enforcement Directorate pursued his case strongly in 1998 for alleged violations of illegal transfer of funds (to the tune of US$1.25 million) to an overseas account in Switzerland.

====During the Emergency====
On 26 June 1975, the day after India declared a state of emergency, the Bombay edition of &quot;TOI&quot; carried an entry in its obituary column that read &quot;D.E.M. O&#x27;Cracy, beloved husband of T.Ruth, father of L.I.Bertie, brother of Faith, Hope and Justice expired on 25 June&quot;. The move was a critique of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s 21-month state of emergency, which is now widely known as &quot;the Emergency&quot; and seen by many as a roundly authoritarian era of Indian government.

==== &quot;Bombay Times&quot; ====
The Bombay Times is a free supplement of The Times of India, in the Mumbai (formerly Bombay) region. It covers celebrity news, news features, international and national music news, international and national fashion news, lifestyle and feature articles pegged on news events both national and international that have local interest value. The main paper covers national news. Over ten years of presence, it has become a benchmark for the Page 3 social scene.

&quot;The Times of India&quot; - and thereby the &quot;Bombay Times&quot; - are market leaders in terms of circulation. The name of this supplement contains the word Bombay, which is the older Portuguese name of the city. It is not retained in the new supplement &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; that comes with &quot;Times of India&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
In late 2006, Times Group acquired Vijayanand Printers Limited (VPL). VPL previously published two Kannada newspapers, &quot;Vijay Karnataka&quot; and &quot;Usha Kiran&quot;, and an English daily, &quot;Vijay Times&quot;. &quot;Vijay Karnataka&quot; was the leader in the Kannada newspaper segment then.

The paper launched a Chennai edition on 12 April 2008. It launched a Kolhapur edition in February 2013.

====TOIFA Awards====
Introduced in 2013 and awarded for the second time in 2016, &quot;The Times of India Film Awards&quot; or the &quot;TOIFA&quot; is an award for the work in Film Industry decided by a global public vote on the nomination categories.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Paid news===
&quot;TOI&quot; has been criticised for being the first to institutionalise the practice of paid news in India, where politicians, businessmen, corporations and celebrities can pay the newspaper and its journalists would carry the desired news for the payer. The newspaper offers prominence with which the paid news is placed and the page on which it is displayed based on the amount of the payment. According to this practice, a payment plan assures a news feature and ensures positive coverage to the payer.

In 2005, &quot;TOI&quot; began the practice of &quot;private treaties&quot;, also called as &quot;brand capital&quot;, where new companies, individuals or movies seeking mass coverage and public relations, major brands and organisations were offered sustained positive coverage and plugs in its news columns in exchange for shares or other forms of financial obligations to Bennett, Coleman &amp; Company, Ltd. (B.C.C.L.) – the owners of &quot;TOI&quot;.

The B.C.C.L., with its &quot;private treaties&quot; program, acquired stakes in 350 companies and generated 15% of its revenues by 2012, according to a critical article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The &quot;paid news&quot; and &quot;private treaties&quot; practice started by &quot;TOI&quot; has since been adopted by &quot;The Hindustan Times&quot; group, the &quot;India Today&quot; group, the &quot;Outlook&quot; group, and other major media groups in India including Indian television channels. This division of the company was later renamed Brand Capital and has contracts in place with many companies in diverse sectors.

The &quot;paid news&quot; and &quot;private treaties&quot; blur the lines between content and advertising, with the favourable coverage written by the staff reporters on the payroll of &quot;TOI&quot;. The newspaper has defended its practice in 2012 by stating that it includes a note of disclosure to the reader – though in a small font – that its contents are &quot;advertorial, entertainment promotional feature&quot;, that they are doing this to generate revenues just like &quot;all newspapers in the world do advertorials&quot; according to &quot;TOI&quot; owners. According to Maya Ranganathan, this overlap in the function of a journalist to also act as a marketing and advertisement revenue seeker for the newspaper raises conflict of interest questions, a problem that has morphed into ever-larger scale in India and recognised by India&#x27;s SEBI authority in July 2009.

Under an ad sales initiative called Medianet, if a large company or Bollywood studio sponsored a news-worthy event, the event would be covered by &quot;TOI,&quot; but the name of the company or studio that sponsored it would not be mentioned in the paper unless they paid &quot;TOI&quot; for advertising. In 2010, a report by a subcommittee of the Press Council of India found that Medianet&#x27;s paid news strategy had spread to a large number of newspapers and more than five hundred television channels.

Critics state that the company&#x27;s paid news and private treaties skew its coverage and shield its newspaper advertisers from scrutiny.

&quot;The Hoot&quot;, a media criticism website, has pointed out that when a lift in a 19-storey luxury apartment complex in Bangalore crashed -- killing two workers and injuring seven -- all the English language and Kannada language newspapers, with the exception of &quot;TOI,&quot; called out the name of the construction company, Sobha Developers, which was a private-treaty partner. An article titled &quot;reaping gold through bt cotton&quot; -- which first appeared in the Nagpur edition of &quot;TOI&quot; in 2008 -- reappeared unchanged in 2011, this time with a small-print alert that the article was a &quot;marketing feature&quot;. In both cases, the article was factually incorrect and made false claims about the success of Monsanto&#x27;s genetically modified cotton.

According to a critical article published in the Indian investigative news magazine &quot;The Caravan&quot;, when the Honda Motors plant in Gurgaon experienced an eight-month-long conflict between management and non-unionised workers over wages and work conditions in 2005, the &quot;Times of India&quot; covered the concerns of Honda and the harm done to India&#x27;s investment climate, and largely ignored the issues raised by workers.

Vineet Jain, managing director of B.C.C.L., has insisted that a wall does exist between sales and the newsroom, and that the paper does not give favorable coverage to the company&#x27;s business partners. &quot;Our editors don&#x27;t know who we have,&quot; Jain said, although he later acknowledged that all private-treaty clients are listed on the company&#x27;s Web site. Ravindra Dhariwal, the former CEO of B.C.C.L. had defended private treaties in a 2010 interview with the magazine &quot;Outlook&quot; and claims that the partners in the private treaties sign contracts where they agree to clauses that they will not receive any favourable editorial coverage.

===Anti-competitive behaviour===
There have been claims that &quot;TOI&quot; would strike deals with advertisers only if they removed their advertisements from other competitor newspapers.

&quot;TOI&quot; is also embroiled in an active lawsuit against the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. In 1993, when the &quot;Financial Times&quot; was preparing to enter the Indian market, Samir Jain, the vice-chairman of B.C.C.L., registered the term &quot;Financial Times&quot; as a trademark of his company and declared it his intellectual property in an attempt to stymie the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and prevent them from competing with &quot;The Economic Times&quot;, which is owned by B.C.C.L.

In 1994, when the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; was the top-selling paper in New Delhi, &quot;TOI&quot; slashed their prices by a third, to one and a half rupees after having built up their ads sales force in preparation for the price drop to make up for the lost circulation revenue. By 1998, the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; had dropped to second place in Delhi. &quot;TOI&quot; took a similar strategy in Bangalore where they dropped the price to one rupee despite protests from Siddharth Varadarajan, one of the editors of the newspaper at the time, who called the strategy &quot;predatory pricing&quot;.

===Cobrapost sting operation===
In 2018, Vineet Jain, managing director of B.C.C.L., and Sanjeev Shah, executive president of B.C.C.L., were caught on camera as part of a sting operation by Cobrapost agreeing to promote right-wing content through the group&#x27;s many media properties for a proposed spend of , some of which the client said could only be paid with black money. B.C.C.L. has responded to the sting claiming that the video that was released by Cobrapost was &quot;doctored&quot; and &quot;incomplete&quot; and that the CEO Vineet Jain was engaged in a &quot;reverse-sting&quot; of his own to expose the undercover reporter during the filming of the video. The company is yet to release the video evidence.

<text>Sir Charles Edward Kingsford Smith (9 February 18978 November 1935), nicknamed Smithy, was an Australian aviation pioneer. He piloted the first transpacific flight and the first flight between Australia and New Zealand.

Kingsford Smith was born in Brisbane. He grew up in Sydney, leaving school at the age of 16 and becoming an engineering apprentice. He joined the Australian Army in 1915 and was a motorcycle despatch rider on the Gallipoli campaign. He later transferred to the Royal Flying Corps and was awarded the Military Cross in 1917 after being shot down. After the war&#x27;s end, Kingsford Smith worked as a barnstormer in England and the United States before returning to Australia in 1921. He subsequently joined West Australian Airways as one of the country&#x27;s first commercial pilots.

In 1928, Kingsford Smith completed the first transpacific flight, a three-leg journey from California to Brisbane via Hawaii and Fiji. He and his co-pilot Charles Ulm became celebrities, together with crew members James Warner and Harry Lyon. In the same year he and Ulm completed the first non-stop flight across Australia from Melbourne to Perth and the first non-stop flight from Australia to New Zealand. They subsequently established Australian National Airways, but the airline and Kingsford Smith&#x27;s other business ventures failed to achieve commercial success. He continued to participate on air races and attempt other aviation feats.

In 1935, Kingsford Smith and his co-pilot Tommy Pethybridge disappeared over the Andaman Sea while attempting to break the Australia–England speed record. He was fêted as a national hero during the Great Depression and received numerous honours during his lifetime. After his death Sydney&#x27;s primary airport was named in his memory and he was featured on the Australian twenty-dollar note for several decades.

== Early and personal life ==

Charles Edward Kingsford Smith was born on 9 February 1897 at Riverview Terrace, Hamilton in Brisbane, Colony of Queensland, the son of William Charles Smith and his wife Catherine Mary (née Kingsford, daughter of Richard Ash Kingsford, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and mayor in both Brisbane and Cairns municipal councils). His birth was officially registered and announced in the newspapers under the surname Smith, which his family used at that time. The earliest use of the surname Kingsford Smith appears to be by his older brother Richard Harold Kingsford Smith, who used the name at least informally from 1901, although he married in New South Wales under the surname Smith in 1903.

In 1903, his parents moved to Canada where they adopted the surname Kingsford Smith. They returned to Sydney in 1907.

Kingsford Smith first attended school in Vancouver, Canada. From 1909 to 1911, he was enrolled at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral School, Sydney, where he was a chorister in the school&#x27;s cathedral choir, and then at Sydney Technical High School, before becoming an engineering apprentice with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at 16.

Kingsford Smith married Thelma Eileen Hope Corboy in 1923. They divorced in 1929. He married Mary Powell in December 1930.

Shortly after his second marriage he joined the New Guard, a radical monarchist, anti-communist, and fascist-inspired organisation.

==World War I and early flying experience==

In 1915, he enlisted for duty in the 1st AIF (Australian Army) and served at Gallipoli. Initially, he performed duty as a motorcycle dispatch rider, before transferring to the Royal Flying Corps, earning his pilot&#x27;s wings in 1917.

In August 1917, while serving with No. 23 Squadron, Kingsford Smith was shot down and received injuries which required amputation of two toes. He was awarded the Military Cross for his gallantry in battle. As his recovery was predicted to be lengthy, Kingsford Smith was permitted to take leave in Australia where he visited his parents. Returning to England, Kingsford Smith was assigned to instructor duties and promoted to Captain.

On 1 April 1918, along with other members of the Royal Flying Corps, Kingsford Smith was transferred to the newly established Royal Air Force. On being demobilised in England, in early 1919, he joined Tasmanian Cyril Maddocks, to form Kingsford Smith, Maddocks Aeros Ltd, flying a joy-riding service mainly in the North of England, during the summer of 1919, initially using surplus DH.6 trainers, then surplus B.E.2s. Later Kingsford Smith worked as a barnstormer in the United States before returning to Australia in 1921.

Applying for a commercial pilot&#x27;s licence on 2 June 1921, he gave his name as &quot;Charles Edward Kingsford-Smith&quot;.

The &quot;Cowra Free Press&quot; told how Kingsford Smith flew under the Lachlan road bridge at Cowra, New South Wales, with local motoring identity Ken Richards. It went on to recount how Kingsford Smith was preparing to also fly under the nearby railway bridge, but was warned by Richards of telegraph wires just in time to prevent a catastrophe. Richards, they added, was a mate of Kingsford Smith, and had flown with him several times in France. In this version of events, the feat was accomplished &quot;just after the Armistice&quot; (11 November 1918), but may have been in July 1921, when Kingsford Smith was hosting &quot;joy flights&quot; there, in an aircraft owned by the Diggers&#x27; Cooperative Aviation Company. Later accounts have embellished the story.
He became one of Australia&#x27;s first airline pilots when he was chosen by Norman Brearley to fly for the newly formed West Australian Airways, and piloted their Bristol Type 28 Coupe Tourers plane (G-AUDF) that made bi-weekly mail drops to the astronomers during the 1922 Solar Eclipse expedition at Wallal, Western Australia. 
Around this time he began to plan his record-breaking flight across the Pacific.

==1928 Trans-Pacific flight==




In 1928, Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm arrived in the United States and began to search for an aircraft. Famed Australian polar explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins sold them a Fokker F.VII/3m monoplane, which they named the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;.

At 8:54 a.m. on 31 May 1928, Kingsford Smith and his 4-man crew left Oakland, California, to attempt the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia. The flight was in three stages. The first, from Oakland to Wheeler Army Airfield, Hawaii, was , taking an uneventful 27 hours 25 minutes (87.54 mph). They took off from Barking Sands on Mana, Kauai, since the runway at Wheeler was not long enough. They headed for Suva, Fiji, away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes (91.45 mph). This was the most demanding portion of the journey, as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. The third leg was the shortest, in 20 hours (84.15 mph), and crossed the Australian coastline near Ballina before turning north to fly to Brisbane, where they landed at 10.50 a.m. on 9 June. The total flight distance was approximately . Kingsford Smith was met by a huge crowd of 26,000 at Eagle Farm Airport, and was welcomed as a hero. Australian aviator Charles Ulm was the relief pilot. The other crewmen were Americans, they were James Warner, the radio operator, and Captain Harry Lyon, the navigator and engineer.

The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia has a film biography of Kingsford Smith, called &quot;An Airman Remembers&quot;, and recordings of Kingsford Smith and Ulm talking about the journey.

A stamp sheet and stamps, featuring the Australian aviators Kingsford Smith and Ulm, were released by Australia Post in 1978, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the flight.

A young New Zealander named Jean Batten attended a dinner in Australia featuring Kingsford Smith after the trans-Pacific flight and told him &quot;I&#x27;m going to learn to fly.&quot; She later convinced him to take her for a flight in the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and went on to become a record-setting aviator, following his example instead of his advice (&quot;Don&#x27;t attempt to break men&#x27;s records – and don&#x27;t fly at night&quot;, he told her in 1928 and remembered wryly later).

==1928 Trans-Tasman flight==
After making the first non-stop flight across Australia from Point Cook near Melbourne to Perth in Western Australia in August 1928, Kingsford Smith and Ulm registered themselves as Australian National Airways (see below). They then decided to attempt the Tasman Sea crossing to New Zealand not only because it had not yet been done, but also in the hope the Australian Government would grant Australian National Airways a subsidised contract to carry scheduled mail regularly. The Tasman had remained unflown after the failure of the first attempt in January 1928, when New Zealanders John Moncrieff and George Hood had vanished without a trace.

Kingsford Smith&#x27;s flight was planned for take off from Richmond, near Sydney, on Sunday 2 September 1928, with a scheduled landing around 9:00 a.m. on 3 September at Wigram Aerodrome, near Christchurch, the principal city in the South Island of New Zealand. This plan drew a storm of protest from New Zealand churchmen about the &quot;sanctity of the Sabbath being set at naught.&quot;

The mayor of Christchurch supported the churchmen and cabled a protest to Kingsford Smith. As it happened, unfavourable weather developed over the Tasman and the flight was deferred, so it is not known whether or how Kingsford Smith would have heeded the cable.

Accompanied by Ulm, navigator Harold Arthur Litchfield, and radio operator Thomas H. McWilliams, a New Zealander made available by the New Zealand Government, Kingsford Smith left Richmond in the evening of 10 September, planning to fly overnight to a daylight landing after a flight of about 14 hours. The planned route was only just over half the distance between Hawaii and Fiji. After a stormy flight, at times through icing conditions, the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; made landfall in much improved weather near Cook Strait, the passage between New Zealand&#x27;s two main islands. At an estimated out from New Zealand, the crew dropped a wreath in memory of the two New Zealanders who had disappeared during their attempt to cross the Tasman Sea earlier that year.

There was a tremendous welcome in Christchurch, where the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; landed at 0922 after a flight of 14 hours and 25 minutes. About 30,000 people made their way to Wigram, including many students from state schools, who were given the day off, and public servants, who were granted leave until 11 a.m. The event was also broadcast live on radio.

While the New Zealand Air Force overhauled the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; free of charge, Kingsford Smith and Ulm were taken on a triumphant tour of New Zealand, flying in Bristol Fighters.

The return to Sydney was made from Blenheim, a small city at the north of the South Island. Hampered by fog, severe weather and a minor navigational error, the flight to Richmond took over 23 hours; on touchdown the aircraft had enough fuel for only another 10 minutes flying.

==Australian National Airways==

In partnership with Ulm, Kingsford Smith established Australian National Airways in 1929. The passenger, mail and freight service commenced operations flying between Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, in January 1930, with five aircraft but closed after crashes in March and November the next year.

==Later flights, the MacRobertson Air Race, the 1934 Pacific Flight==
After collecting his &#x27;old bus&#x27;, &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, from the Fokker aircraft company in the Netherlands where it had been overhauled, in June 1930 he achieved an east–west crossing of the Atlantic from Ireland to Newfoundland in hours, having taken off from Portmarnock Beach (The Velvet Strand), just north of Dublin. New York gave him a tumultuous welcome. The &quot;Southern Cross&quot; continued on to Oakland, California, completing a circumnavigation of the world, begun in 1928. In 1930, he competed in an England to Australia air race, and, flying solo, won the event taking 13 days. He arrived in Sydney on 22 October 1930.

In 1931, he purchased an Avro Avian he named the &quot;Southern Cross Minor&quot;, to attempt an Australia-to-England flight. He later sold the aircraft to Captain W.N. &quot;Bill&quot; Lancaster who vanished on 11 April 1933 over the Sahara Desert; Lancaster&#x27;s remains were not found until 1962. The wreck of the &quot;Southern Cross Minor&quot; is now in the Queensland Museum. In the early 1930s, Smith began developing the Southern Cross automobile as a side project.

In 1933, Seven Mile Beach, New South Wales, was used by Kingsford Smith as the runway for the first commercial flight between Australia and New Zealand.

In 1934, he purchased a Lockheed Altair, the &quot;Lady Southern Cross&quot;, with the intention of competing in the MacRobertson Air Race.

==Disappearance and death==

Kingsford Smith and co-pilot John Thompson &#x27;Tommy&#x27; Pethybridge were flying the &quot;Lady Southern Cross&quot; overnight from Allahabad (modern Prayagraj), India, to Singapore, as part of their attempt to break the England-Australia speed record held by C. W. A. Scott and Tom Campbell Black, when they disappeared over the Andaman Sea in the early hours of 8 November 1935. Aviator Jimmy Melrose claimed to have seen the &quot;Lady Southern Cross&quot; fighting a storm from shore and over the sea with fire coming from its exhaust. Despite a search for 74 hours over the Bay of Bengal by one person, British pilot Eric Stanley Greenwood, OBE, their bodies were never recovered.

Eighteen months later, Burmese fishermen found an undercarriage leg and wheel, with its tyre still inflated, which had been washed ashore at Aye Island in the Gulf of Martaban, off the southeast coastline of Burma, some south of Mottama (formerly known as Martaban). Lockheed confirmed the undercarriage leg to be from the &quot;Lady Southern Cross&quot;. Botanists who examined the weeds clinging to the undercarriage leg estimated that the aircraft lies not far from the island at a depth of approximately . The undercarriage leg is now on public display at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia.

In 2009, filmmaker and explorer Damien Lay stated he was certain he had found the &quot;Lady Southern Cross&quot;. The location of the claimed find was widely misreported as &quot;in the Bay of Bengal&quot;. However, the 2009 search, was in fact, at the same location where the landing gear had been found in 1937, at Aye Island in the Andaman Sea.

Kingsford Smith was survived by his wife, Mary, Lady Kingsford Smith, and their three-year-old son Charles Jnr. Kingsford Smith&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Flying Life&quot;, was published posthumously in 1937 and became a best-seller.

Following The Joint Australian Myanmar Lady Southern Cross Search Expedition II (LSCSEII) in 2009, Lay conducted a total of ten further expeditions to Myanmar to recover wreckage from the site. In 2011, Lay claimed to have found the wreckage, but that claim has been widely disputed, and no evidence confirming the claim has been forthcoming. The location of the site, approximately 1.8 miles off the coast of Myanmar, has never been publicly released.

Lay has worked closely with both the Kingsford Smith and Pethybridge families since 2005. The privately funded project was supported by the government and people of Myanmar. In December 2017 Lay was still searching for parts of the &quot;Lady Southern Cross&quot;.

==Honours and legacy==

In 1930, Kingsford Smith was the inaugural recipient of the Segrave Trophy, awarded for &quot;Outstanding Skill, Courage and Initiative on Land, Water [or] in the Air&quot;.

Kingsford Smith was knighted in the 1932 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List as a Knight Bachelor. He received the accolade on 3 June 1932 from His Excellency Sir Isaac Isaacs, the Governor-General of Australia, for services to aviation and later was appointed honorary Air Commodore of the Royal Australian Air Force.

In 1986, Kingsford Smith was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

The major airport of Sydney, located in the suburb of Mascot, was named Kingsford Smith International Airport in his honour. The federal electorate surrounding the airport is named the Division of Kingsford Smith, and includes the suburb of Kingsford.

His most famous aircraft, the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, is now preserved and displayed in a purpose-built memorial to Kingsford Smith near the International Terminal at Brisbane Airport. Kingsford Smith sold the plane to the Australian Government in 1935 for £3000 so it could be put on permanent display for the public. The plane was carefully stored for many years before the current memorial was built.

Kingsford Smith Drive in Brisbane passes through the suburb of his birth, Hamilton. Another Kingsford Smith Drive, which is located in the Canberra district of Belconnen, intersects with Southern Cross Drive.

Opened in 2009, Kingsford Smith School in the Canberra suburb of Holt was named after the famous aviator, as was Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith Elementary School in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

He was pictured on the Australian $20 paper note (in circulation from 1966 until 1994, when the $20 polymer note was introduced to replace it), to honour his contribution to aviation and his accomplishments during his life. He was also depicted on the Australian one-dollar coin of 1997, the centenary of his birth.

Albert Park in Suva, where he landed on the trans-Pacific flight, now contains the Kingsford Smith Pavilion.

A memorial stands at Seven Mile Beach in New South Wales commemorating the first commercial flight to New Zealand.

Qantas named its sixth Airbus A380 (VH-OQF) after Kingsford Smith.

KLM named one of its Boeing 747s (PH-BUM) after Kingsford Smith.

A trans-Encke propeller moonlet, an inferred minor body, of Saturn is named after him.

Australian aviation enthusiast Austin Byrne was part of the large crowd at Sydney&#x27;s Mascot Aerodrome in June 1928 to welcome the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and its crew following their successful trans-Pacific flight. Witnessing this event inspired Byrne to make a scale model of the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; to give to Kingsford Smith. After the aviator&#x27;s disappearance, Byrne continued to expand and enhance his tribute with paintings, photographs, documents, and artworks he created, designed or commissioned. Between 1930 and his death in 1993, Byrne devoted his life to creating and touring his &quot;Southern Cross&quot; Memorial.

<text>Chinese Buddhism or Han Buddhism () is a Chinese form of Mahayana Buddhism. The Chinese Buddhist canon draws from the traditions of Confucianism and Taoism as well as the rituals of local folk religions. Chinese Buddhism emphasizes the study of Mahayana sutras and treatises. Some of the most important scriptures in Chinese Buddhism include the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, &quot;Flower Ornament Sutra&quot;, &quot;Vimalakirtī Sutra&quot;, &quot;Nirvana Sutra,&quot; and &quot;Amitābha Sutra&quot;. Chinese Buddhism is the largest institutionalized religion in mainland China. Currently, there are an estimated 185 to 250 million Chinese Buddhists in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is also a major religion in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, as well as among the Chinese Diaspora.

Buddhism was first introduced to China during the Han dynasty (206 BCE220 CE). It was promoted by multiple emperors, especially during the Tang dynasty (618–907), which helped it spread across the country. The translation of a large body of Indian Buddhist scriptures into Chinese and the inclusion of these translations (along with Taoist and Confucian works) into a Chinese Buddhist canon had far-reaching implications for the dissemination of Buddhism throughout the East Asian cultural sphere, including Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Chinese Buddhism also developed various unique traditions of Buddhist thought and practice, including Tiantai, Huayan, Chan Buddhism, and Pure Land Buddhism.

From its inception, Chinese Buddhism has been influenced by native Chinese religions and philosophy, especially Confucianism and Taoism, but also Chinese folk religion.

== History ==


=== The establishment of Buddhism in China ===
Buddhist missionaries began bringing Buddhism to China during the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), and the religion was present in China at the beginning of the common era.

Buddhist missionaries made use of both the overland Central Asian Silk Road and the maritime routes. Initially Buddhism was poorly understood and often confused with and mixed with Taoism. The Chinese saw many similarities between the two religions. There was also much criticism leveled at the new foreign religion by the Confucian elites.

Centuries after Buddhism originated in India, the Mahayana Buddhism arrived in China through the Silk Route in 1st century CE via Tibet.

One of the central tasks of the initial missionaries was the translation of Buddhist texts. The first surviving translations of Buddhist texts into Chinese were those of the 2nd century Parthian An Shigao (Ch. ), who worked in the capital of Luoyang. His work was followed by the extensive Mahayana translations of the Kushan monk Lokakṣema (Ch. , active –186 CE), as well as the work of Dharmarakṣa (3rd century).

During this early period, the Dharmaguptaka school was very influential in establishing Buddhism in China. This resulted in the widespread adoption of the Dharmaguptaka school&#x27;s Vinaya (monastic rule) by all Chinese Buddhist schools&quot;.&quot;

The arrival of the Kuchan scholar Kumārajīva (334–413 CE) was a key event. Unlike the previous translators, Kumārajīva was supported by the state and given the title of national preceptor. The high-quality translations produced by his team had a significant impact on Chinese Buddhism. He is also known for introducing the Madhyamaka school of Buddhist philosophy, which would later be called Sanlun (the &quot;Three Treatise school&quot;). His work also established an Indic foundation for Chinese Buddhist philosophy, which previously had been heavily influenced by Taoist philosophy.

By the 460s Buddhism was a mainstream institution in China, and its iconography and art were widely recognized. The Dunhuang and Yungang cave complexes are a great example of early Chinese Buddhist art from this period.

Another important translator was Paramārtha (&quot;Zhēndì&quot;, 499–569 CE) who along with his team of Chinese disciples translated numerous works on Abhidharma, Yogachara philosophy, and other Mahayana texts. The work of other sixth century translators like Bodhiruci and Ratnamati also contributed to the establishment of a new Chinese Yogacara school, also known as the &quot;Consciousness-Only school&quot; (唯識宗; pinyin: Wéishí-zōng).

=== The development of a Chinese Buddhism ===

The 6th and 7th centuries saw a flowering of new and unique Chinese Buddhist traditions, including:

* The Tiantai school mainly founded by the efforts of master Zhiyi (538–597 CE) and based on the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and works of Zhiyi.
* The Huayan (&quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;) school, based on the works of Chinese masters like Dushun (557–640), Zhiyan (602–668), and Fazang (643–712).
* The Pure Land tradition, which is based on the veneration of Amitabha and the works of Pure Land masters like Tanluan (476–542), Daochuo (562–645), and Shandao (613–81).
* Chan Buddhism, based on the teachings of various Chan masters such as Bodhidharma, Dazu Huike (487–593), Sengcan (d. 606), Dayi Daoxin (580–651), and Hongren (601–674).
During the Tang dynasty, the monk Xuanzang (602–664) journeyed to India and back and wrote extensive and detailed reports of his findings, which have subsequently become important for the study of India during this period. Xuanzang also brought back many Buddhist texts and led a translation team which was responsible for many influential Chinese translations of classic Buddhist works. His efforts led to the establishment of the idealistic Yogachara (Consciousness-only) tradition in East Asia.

The Tang era was a period of significant development for Buddhism in China. During this time, a sinicized Buddhism was widely accepted and practiced throughout the empire, with many monasteries and temples. Buddhism was popular with all social classes and was influential on Chinese culture, having more followers than Taoism. Buddhist themes can be found in much of the literature of this period, such as in the works of famous poets like Wang Wei (701–761) and Bo Juyi (772 – 846). Artistic complexes from this period, such as the Longmen Grottoes, also attest to the artistic expression of Chinese Buddhism during this era.

A well known proponent of Buddhism during the Tang era was empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) and she is known for her promotion of the Longmen cave complex. She also depicted herself as a bodhisattva.

The next important event in the history of Chinese Buddhism was the arrival of Subhakarasimha, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra, and their establishment of Chinese Esoteric Buddhism from 716 to 720, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. This Chinese form of Vajrayana Buddhism now became popular with the elites and by the time of Emperor Daizong of Tang (r. 762–779), its influence among the upper classes was significant.

The Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution (841–845) under Emperor Wuzong of Tang greatly impacted and weakened the Buddhist institutions in China. Perhaps the main reason for this persecution was the Chinese state&#x27;s need for tax and wealth.

The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960/979), an era of political upheaval and civil war, also negatively impacted Chinese Buddhism. Various Chinese Buddhist traditions contracted or died out during this period.

The Song dynasty (960–1279) saw the flourishing of Chinese Buddhist culture. During this era, Chan Buddhism grew to become the most influential school, with close ties to the imperial government and an organized system of temple rank and administration. It was during this time that the Five Houses of Chan developed. Many classic Chan texts were written during this era, such as the koan collections of the Linji school, like the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; (1125) and &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot; (1228).

Likewise, during this time, the works of Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091–1157) developed the silent sitting method of &quot;silent illumination&quot;. Both of these traditions of Chan practice were influential (and remain so) on East Asian Zen Buddhism (including on Japanese Zen, Korean Seon, and Vietnamese Thiền).

The Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) patronized Tibetan Buddhism and thus, during this period there was a steady growth of this tradition in China. A common perception was that this patronage of lamas caused corrupt forms of tantra to become widespread. When the Yuan dynasty was overthrown and the Ming dynasty was established, the Tibetan lamas were expelled from the court, and this form of Buddhism was denounced as not being an orthodox path.

During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), there was a revival of the study of native Chinese traditions like Tiantai, Huayan, and Yogachara, and most monks belonged to the two dominant Chan schools: Linji and Caodong. At this point in its history, Chinese Buddhism had also become quite eclectic, drawing from all the main Chinese traditions. An example of this is the figure of Hanshan Deqing, one of the great reformers of Chinese Buddhism. Like many of his contemporaries, he advocated the dual practice of the Chan and Pure Land methods. He also directed practitioners in the use of mantras as well as scripture reading. He was also renowned as a lecturer and commentator and was admired for his strict adherence to the precepts.

=== Modernity ===
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the imperial court shifted its support to the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. Chinese Buddhism suffered during the various imperial and internal conflicts of the Qing dynasty, especially the Taiping rebellion (December 1850 – August 1864), which saw many temples destroyed and scriptures burned by rebels. This era also saw the arrival of Christian missionaries to China, a right which had been granted to Western powers after the Opium Wars.

During the Republican period (1912–1949), there were efforts to reform and modernize Chinese Buddhism in response to the challenges of modernity. The most notable of these reformers were the Humanistic Buddhists, like Taixu and Yin Shun. Humanistic Buddhism sought to move away from ritualistic and otherworldly obsessions to embrace more worldly pursuits like education and charitable work. There was also a revival of Chinese Chan by Hsu Yun and Sheng Yen, as well as a revival of Tiantai Buddhism by Dixian and Tanxu (1875 – 1963).

==== People&#x27;s Republic of China ====
After the Chinese Communist Revolution, many Buddhists and monastics followed the Republican exodus to Taiwan. In the latter half of the twentieth century, many new Buddhist temples and organizations were set up by the exiles in Taiwan, including Fo Guang Shan, Dharma Drum Mountain, and Tzu Chi. These organizations also became influential back in Mainland China after the end of the Cultural Revolution.

Chinese Buddhism suffered extensive repression, persecution, and destruction during the Cultural Revolution (from 1966 until Mao Zedong&#x27;s death in 1976). Maoist propaganda depicted Buddhism as one of the Four Olds, as a superstitious instrument of the ruling class and as counter-revolutionary. Buddhist clergy were attacked, disrobed, arrested, and sent to camps. Buddhist writings were burned. Buddhist temples, monasteries, and art were systematically destroyed and Buddhist lay believers ceased any public displays of their religion.

During the normalization period (Boluan Fanzheng, 1977 to early 80s) led by Deng Xiaoping, a new revival of Chinese Buddhism began to take place. This was a period which saw the restoration of damaged Buddhist temples like Guoqing Temple and Guanghua Temple, as well as the return of monastic ordination and Buddhist institutions. Monks like Zhenchan (真禪) and Mengcan (夢參), who were trained in the Chan and Huayan traditions, traveled widely throughout China as well as other countries, such as the United States, and lectured on both Chan and Huayan teachings. Monks are required to obtain certificates from the authorities that permit them to reside in monasteries.

The Buddhist Association of China is the sole official government supervisory organ of Buddhism in the country. It is directed by the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 

== Teaching and practice ==


=== Doctrine and texts ===
Chinese Buddhism is a sinicized form of Mahāyāna Buddhism, which draws on the Chinese Buddhist Canon (大藏經, &quot;Dàzàngjīng&quot;, &quot;Great Storage of Scriptures&quot;) as well as numerous Chinese traditions. Chinese Buddhism focuses on studying Mahayana sutras and Mahāyāna treatises and draws its main doctrines from these sources. Some of the most important scriptures in Chinese Buddhism include: the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Flower Ornament Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Vimalakirtī Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Nirvana Sutra,&quot; and the &quot;Amitābha Sutra&quot;.

As such, Chinese Buddhism follows the classic Mahāyāna Buddhist worldview, which includes a belief in many realms of existence, the existence of many Buddhas and bodhisattvas, as well as many other kinds of divine beings, ghosts, and so on. Chinese Buddhism also upholds classic Mahayana Buddhist doctrines like karma () and rebirth (), the bodhisattva path, and the doctrines of emptiness, buddha-nature, and the one vehicle .

When it comes to Buddhist philosophy, Chinese Buddhism contains various doctrinal traditions, the most important being the Tiantai, Huayan, Sanlun, and Weishi schools of thought. These different doctrinal traditions developed their own scriptural commentaries and treatises and also various doctrinal classifications (panjiao), which hierarchically ordered the mass of Buddhist scriptures in order to advance their school&#x27;s hermeneutical worldview. For example, according to master Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;eight teachings and five periods&quot; classification, the final and supreme teaching of the Buddha is found in the Lotus Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra. According to the Huayan masters like Fazang, the Huayan sutra contains the supreme teaching, while the Weishi school held that the Yogachara texts are where the &quot;third turning&quot; of the Dharma can be found, and thus, represent the final and ultimate teaching of the Buddha.

=== Practices ===

Chinese Buddhism contains a wide array of religious practices and observances. Ritual and devotional practices are commonly seen as generating karmic merit, which can bring about positive results in this life or the next.

According to Mario Poceski, for the vast majority of ordinary Chinese Buddhists, &quot;prevalent expressions of Buddhist piety were (and still are) channeled via a variety of popular modes of worship and ritual observance.&quot; Worship services can include Buddhist devotional practices like offerings to an altar (of items like incense, flowers, food, and candles), ceremonial bowing, and extensive liturgies (including repentance ceremonies, rites for good health, and memorials for the dead). According to Chün-fang Yü, the most popular Chinese Buddhist ritual that is most widely performed today is the Great Compassion Repentance associated with Guanyin and the &quot;Great Compassion Dharani&quot;.

Keeping sets of ethical rules, like the classic Buddhist five precepts, are another key part of Buddhist practice. Taking up the ethical precepts in a ceremony, along with taking refuge in the three jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha), is a common way of entering the Buddhist path. Another important set of ethical precepts is the &quot;bodhisattva precepts&quot; of the &quot;Brahmā&#x27;s Net Sutra&quot;, which are often practiced by both laity and monastics. Acts of charity or social service () are also an important of part of Chinese Buddhist ethics.

Another key part of Chinese Buddhism is engaging in Buddhist meditations such as chanting the Buddha&#x27;s name (nianfo), which is the core practice of Pure Land Buddhism, and seated meditation (&quot;zazen&quot;), which is the focus of the Chan tradition. The practice of recitation of the Buddha&#x27;s name is commonly done in a group setting, sometimes as part of an intensive nianfo recitation retreat, which can last for several days. These retreats might also include chanting sutras, taking of the eight precepts, silent meditation, and Dharma lectures.

Textual practices are also commonly practiced by monks and laypersons. These include printing, copying, propagating and reciting Buddhist scriptures, studying Buddhist texts, and attending lectures. Buddhist temples may also have special elements associated with sacred texts, such as lecture halls or dharma halls, libraries, and scripture platforms (施法壇), a kind of sacred podium.

Other important Buddhist rituals are those related to death, which is seen as a key moment for Buddhists who want to attain a good rebirth in the pure land of a Buddha (the most popular being Amitabha&#x27;s pure land). The focus of these rituals is to keep the dying person free of distractions and offer spiritual support (so they can focus their minds on Amitabha Buddha through the repetition of the Buddha&#x27;s name). It is commonly believed that during these rituals one can experience auspicious signs, like visions of Amitabha and bright lights.

Pilgrimages to well-known monasteries and sites, like the Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains (Mount Wutai, Mount Emei, Mount Jiuhua, and Mount Putuo) are also undertaken by monastics and lay practitioners alike.

Another popular practice is the use of mantras and &quot;dhāraṇī&quot;s, such as the popular &quot;Mahā Karuṇā Dhāraṇī&quot; and the &quot;Cundī Dhāraṇī&quot;. Robert Gimello has also observed that in Chinese Buddhist communities, the esoteric practices of Cundī enjoyed popularity among both the common people and the elite.

=== Deities and temples ===


Various Mahāyāna Buddhist deities are venerated in Chinese Buddhism, most of which are Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Some of the key figures include:

* Śākyamuni (Shijiamoni, &quot;sage of the śākyas&quot;), the historical founder of Buddhism, commonly depicted with Ᾱnanda and Mahākāśyapa, or in a triad with Amitabha and Medicine Buddha.
* Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion who has various forms (such as the thousand arms form), the most popular being the motherly Guānyīn.
* Amitābha Buddha (pinyin: Ēmítuó fó, &quot;Limitless Light&quot;), also called Amitāyus (&quot;Limitless Life&quot;), associated with the pure land of Sukhavati, which many hope to reach after death
* Vairocana (Dàrì Rúlái), the cosmic primordial Buddha 
* Medicine Buddha (Yàoshī fó), associated with medicinal powers
* Maitreya bodhisattva (Mílè púsà), is seen as the Buddha of the future, sometimes depicted as a fat laughing Buddha
* Manjushri bodhisattva (Wénshū púsà), the bodhisattva of wisdom, associated with Mount Wutai, often appears mounted on a lion.
* Samantabhadra bodhisattva (Pǔxián púsà), often depicted riding an elephant, is associated with confession and repentance rites and the bodhisattva vows.
* Kṣitigarbha bodhisattva (Dìzàng púsà), the savior monk associated with rites for the deceased
* The Eighteen Arhats (Shíbā Luóhàn)
* The Four Great Heavenly Kings (Sìdà Tiānwáng)
* The Twenty-Four Protective Deities (Chinese: 二十四諸天; pinyin: &quot;Èrshísì Zhūtiān&quot;), a common ser ot Chinese Buddhist protector deities (dharmapalas).

Chinese Buddhist temples usually include numerous images and statues of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. They are often ritually carved and installed as part of a consecration ritual that may include chanting and scripture reading. Devotion towards these are a major part of Chinese Buddhism. As Chün-fang Yü writes, &quot;people in China worship Buddhas and bodhisattvas in rituals, write poems and novels about them, praise them in songs and hymns, and tell stories and stage plays about them. And above all else, they worship the images of these holy beings.&quot;

According to Mario Poceski, Chinese Buddhist temples generally follow a traditional Chinese palace layout. They &quot;consist of a series of halls and courtyards that are arranged symmetrically around a central axis, which usually runs from north to south. The main hall is typically a large building that is centrally located along the main axis. In larger monasteries or temples, a number of ancillary halls also house the images of lesser Buddhist divinities, giving residents and visitors alike a wide choice of objects of worship and supplication.&quot;

Another common structure is a pagoda, which may contain Buddhist relics and statues or images of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.

There is a conception of an &quot;impersonal god&quot; in Chinese Buddhism likely inspired by Shangdi.

=== Monasticism ===

Buddhist monasticism is an important part of Chinese Buddhism. Chinese Buddhist monastics (both male and female) follow the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, which is known as the &quot;Four Part Vinaya&quot; (&quot;Sifen lü&quot;) in China and has 250 rules for monks and 348 for nuns.

Buddhist monks and nuns perform numerous religious practices and services, including offerings to altars, liturgical services, circumambulating the Buddha hall, preaching the scriptures, Dharma lectures, ritual meals, and chanting at mealtime, as well as confession and repentance rituals.

There have been many different types of monasteries throughout Chinese Buddhist history. There are city monasteries, country monasteries, and monasteries deep in the mountains. Some monasteries may be large and rich, with thousands of monastics, while others are small with just a few monastics. The most prestigious monasteries have support from rich elites, and the smallest are usually in small villages.

=== Vegetarianism and Veganism ===

The Chinese word 纯净素 (chún jìng sù ) meaning pure Buddhist Vegan/ Vegetarian is widely promoted and practiced in Chinese Buddhism. The practice is promoted in various Mahayana sutras, like the 楞伽阿跋多羅寶經 léngqié ābáduōluó bǎojīng.

Monastics are often required to be vegetarian or Vegan and other animal products are often banned in Buddhist temples and monasteries. Other dietary restrictions may include avoiding eggs, dairy, and the five types of pungent vegetables.

Devout laity are also often vegetarian. Some laypersons may practice being vegetarian on certain sacred days, during religious retreats, or on certain festivals.

Temples and monasteries often have vegetarian dining halls and vegetarian feasts are a common feature of popular celebrations.

===Laypeople in Chinese Buddhism===

In Chinese Buddhism, lay Buddhist practitioners have traditionally played an important role, and lay practice of Buddhism has had similar tendencies to those of monastic Buddhism in China. Many historical biographies of lay Buddhists are available, which give a clear picture of their practices and role in Chinese Buddhism. In addition to these numerous biographies, there are accounts from Jesuit missionaries, such as Matteo Ricci, which provide extensive and revealing accounts to the degree Buddhism penetrated elite and popular culture in China.

Traditional practices such as meditation, mantra recitation, mindfulness of Amitābha Buddha, asceticism, and vegetarianism were all integrated into the belief systems of ordinary people. It is known from accounts in the Ming dynasty that lay practitioners often engaged in practices from both the Pure Land and Chan traditions, as well as the study of the Buddhist sutras. The &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Diamond Sūtra&quot; were the most popular, followed by the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;.

=== Syncretism and multiple religious belonging ===

Chinese Buddhism also include influences from native Chinese Religions, including Confucianism, Taoism, and Chinese folk religion. This ecumenical attitude and embrace of religious pluralism has been a common feature of Chinese culture since ancient times. For example, Chinese Buddhists may practice qigong, tai chi, and gongfu, venerate native Chinese deities (like Guan Yu, Mazu, and Monkey King), engage in ancestor veneration, practice traditional Chinese medicine, and make use of Feng shui and Chinese talismans. Chinese religions like Taoism and Confucianism were also, in turn, influenced by Chinese Buddhism.

The ancient idea of the compatibility of the Three Teachings (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism) is common in China and is expressed in the phrase &quot;the&quot; &quot;three teachings harmonious as one&quot; (). Chinese Buddhism developed Chinese mythologies and philosophies which incorporated and accommodated Chinese religions. For example, Chinese Buddhist apocryphal texts tell of how Laozi was actually a disciple of the Buddha and also how Confucius was a bodhisattva. Chinese Buddhist thinkers like Guifeng Zongmi argued that all three teachings should be followed and practiced since they all contain important truths (though he also considered Buddhism to reveal the highest truth).

One such important element of Chinese Buddhism are religious practices focused on one&#x27;s ancestors, something that is shared in common with other traditional Chinese religions. This can include paying respect to them at various sites and at festivals like the Qingming and Zhong Yuan Festival, as well as participating in services to pray for one&#x27;s deceased ancestors.

The ritual burning of incense (shaoxiang, jingxiang) is another common religious practice in Buddhist spaces derived from traditional Chinese religion. During the Zhou dynasty, the Chinese believed that smoke resulting from burning of sandalwood would act as a bridge between the human world and the spirits. The practice remains a common offering in Chinese Buddhism, which it shared with other Chinese religions.

Another common feature of Chinese religion is multiple religious belonging. As such, Chinese adherents may also practice Buddhism alongside other Chinese religious practices without seeing this as conflicting. According to Mario Poceski:many or even most people who actually come to worship at Buddhist temples are not hardcore believers. A good number of them assume the kinds of fuzzy or hybrid religious identities that are typical of Chinese religiosity; among other things, that can mean that many of them also worship at Daoist temples or shrines associated with popular religion. This is one of the reasons why it is very difficult to arrive at reliable data about the number of &quot; Buddhists &quot; in China. During the Tang and Yuan dynasties, Chinese Buddhism was also in proximity to Chinese branches of the Church of the East and Christianity in general, and competed with these traditions, especially in the Tang dynasty. Chinese, Tibetan, and Mongolian Buddhism were also significantly influenced by them as Mongolian Buddhism, influenced by Nestorian beliefs and Tibetan Buddhism, spread out during the Yuan dynasty. The three Buddhist traditions also heavily influenced each other at the time.

==Traditions==

=== Major Chinese Buddhist traditions ===
Traditional Chinese Buddhist scholars like Sheng-yen enumerate thirteen Buddhist traditions or schools (Chinese: &quot;zōng&quot;). This list is also found in traditional Japanese Buddhist histories, particularly that of Gyōnen (1240–1321).

Over time, some of these schools survived or were revived as living traditions, while others are now defunct historical traditions or were absorbed into other schools. These &quot;traditions&quot; are not rigid designations and there has always been much intermixing, and many temples and communities are influenced by many of these traditions (and also by local Chinese custom and traditional Chinese religions like Taoism). Some traditions may also have numerous sub-schools or sects.

The various Chinese Buddhist traditions are not exclusivist, and are better seen as trends, emphases, schools of thought, or &quot;dharma-gates&quot; (法門, fǎmén), instead of as separate sects. Chün-fang Yü quotes a famous saying which describes the harmonious situation in Chinese Buddhism, &quot;Tiantai and Huayan for doctrine, Chan and Pure Land for practice.&quot;

As Mario Poceski notes, Chinese Buddhism &quot;lacks clear [sectarian divisions of the kind we find in other Buddhist traditions&quot;. All Chinese monastics follow the same ordination procedures and monastic precepts, and as such, there is no rigid separation between &quot;schools&quot; or &quot;sects&quot;. While traditions like Chan and Tiantai are understood as distinctive teachings, they are all part of the single Chinese Buddhist tradition, which is &quot;characterized by broad-minded acceptance of a variety of styles of discourse, modes of worship, and approaches to spiritual cultivation.&quot; Due to Chinese Buddhism&#x27;s acceptance of diversity, ecumenism, and difference, most Chinese Buddhists would not identify themselves as being part of a specific &quot;school&quot;. That being said, there are still disagreements and doctrinal debates within the community.

The &quot;thirteen schools&quot; are:

* The Chengshi school (historical), which focused on the study of the &quot;Tattvasiddhi-Śāstra&quot; (&quot;The Treatise that Accomplishes Reality&quot;; Chinese: 成實論, &quot;Chengshilun&quot;).
* The Kosa School (俱舍宗) (historical), based on the study of Abhidharma using the &quot;Abhidharmakośa&quot; of Vasubandhu.
* The &quot;Three Treatises&quot; school (三論&quot;, Sānlùn&quot;, Chinese Madhyamaka), founded by Kumarajiva (344–413 CE).
* The Pure Land school
* The Nirvana school (historical), based on the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; translated by Dharmarakṣa (c. 233–310); this was later absorbed into the Tiāntāi school. 
* The Dilun school (based on the &quot;Daśabhūmikā sutra&quot; translated by Bodhiruci); this was later absorbed into the Huayan tradition. 
* The She lun school (based on Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Summary of the Mahayana&quot; translated by Paramartha); it was later absorbed into the Huáyán and Consciousness-only schools.
* The Consciousness Only school (唯識宗; &quot;Wéishí&quot;, Yogācāra), a.k.a. Faxiang (&quot;dharma characteristics&quot;) school, founded by Xuanzang (602–664) and based on his &quot;Chengweishilun&quot; (&quot;The Demonstration of Consciousness-only&quot;)&quot;.&quot;
* The Tiantai school, also known as the Lotus school, due to their focus on the &quot;Lotus Sutra.&quot;
* The Huayan school, the school of the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;.
* The Vinaya school or Nanshan school, a historical tradition which focused on the Dharmaguptaka monastic discipline, established by the monk Daoxuan (596–667). 
* The Chan (Dhyana) school, i.e. the Zen tradition attributed to the founder Bodhidharma, which focuses on sitting meditation (&quot;zuòchán&quot;) and developed numerous sub-schools like Caodong and Linji.
* The Zhenyan school (真言宗, &quot;true word&quot;, &quot;mantra&quot; school), i.e. Chinese Esoteric Buddhism. Also called &quot;Mìjiao&quot; (密教; Esoteric Teaching), &quot;Mìzōng&quot; (密宗; &quot;Esoteric Tradition&quot;), or &quot;Tángmì&quot; (唐密; &quot;Tang Esoterica&quot;).
Many of these traditions were also later exported to other East Asian nations, like Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.

According to Sheng-yen, the Chan school is the most popular school in China today, though this is often combined with Pure Land practice as well. Sheng-yen also notes that the Tiantai, Huayan, Three Treatises, Consciousness Only, Vinaya, and Esoteric traditions are also present in modern Chinese Buddhism, though to a lesser extent.

There is also a modernist movement called Humanistic Buddhism, which emphasizes humanism, charity, and other humanitarian practices that help improve social conditions.

===New religious movements===
There are many sects and organisations proclaiming a Buddhist identity and pursuit (&quot;fo&quot; or &quot;fu&quot;: &quot;awakening&quot;, &quot;enlightenment&quot;) that are not recognised as legitimate Buddhism by the Chinese Buddhist Association and the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. These groups include:

* Guanyin Buddhism [Awakening Teaching] ( &quot;Guānyīn Fójiào&quot;) or Guanyin Church ( &quot;Guānyīn Huì&quot;)
* True Buddha School
*Buddhism [Awakening Teaching] of the Lord of Heaven of Infinite Thriving of the Mountain of Longevity ( &quot;Shòushān Wànlóng Tiānzhǔ Fójiào&quot;)
*Wulian Jingang Dadao (&quot;Great Way of the Innumerable Attendants of Awakening&quot;)
*Hanmi Chinese esoteric Buddhism, Living Buddha Dechan Jueren

== Holidays and festivals ==


Chinese Buddhists celebrate numerous religious festivals and holidays and these are the most widely attended and popular Chinese Buddhist events.

During religious festivals, Chinese people visit temples to take part in rituals, chanting, food, celebrations, parades, and to make offerings of prayers, incense, fruits, flowers, and donations. On such days, they may observe the moral precepts very strictly, as well as a full day&#x27;s vegetarian diet. Some of the most important holidays celebrated by Chinese Buddhists include: Buddha&#x27;s Birthday (on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month), Chinese New Year and the Lantern Festival (on the first and fifteenth days of the first lunar month), and the Ghost Festival (fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month).

<text>The ghost knifefishes are a family, Apteronotidae, of ray-finned fishes in the order Gymnotiformes. These fish are native to Panama and South America. They inhabit a wide range of freshwater habitats, but more than half the species in the family are found deep in rivers (typically deeper than ) where there is little or no light.

The Apteronotidae should not be confused with the unrelated Notopteridae, which are also commonly called knifefishes.

They are distinguished from other gymnotiform fishes by the presence of a caudal fin (all other families lack a caudal fin) as well as a fleshy dorsal organ represented by a longitudinal strip along the dorsal midline. They vary greatly in size, ranging from about in total length in the smallest species to in the largest. It has been claimed that &quot;Apteronotus magdalenensis&quot; is up to , but this is not supported by recent studies, which indicate that it does not surpass about . These nocturnal fish have small eyes. Also, sexual dimorphism exists in some genera in snout shape and jaws.

Apteronotids use a high frequency tone-type (also called wave-type) electric organ discharge (EOD) to communicate.

Many Apteronotids are aggressive predators of small aquatic insect larvae and fishes, though there are also piscivorous and planktivorous species. Species of the genus &quot;Sternarchella&quot; are very unusual, preying on the tails of other electric fishes. Other species, such as &quot;Sternarchorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Sternarchorhamphus&quot;, have tubular snouts and forage on the beds of aquatic insect larvae and other small animals which burrow into the river bottom. At least one species (&quot;Sternarchogiton nattereri&quot;) eats freshwater sponges which grow on submerged trees, stumps, and other woody debris.
The genus &quot;Apteronotus&quot; is artificial and some of the species do not actually belong in it.

The black ghost knifefish (&quot;Apteronotus albifrons&quot;) and brown ghost knifefish (&quot;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&quot;) are readily available as aquarium fish. Others are known to appear in the trade but are quite rare.

==Genera==
FishBase lists 89 species in 16 genera, However, after a number of recent taxonomic advances, Eschmeyer&#x27;s Catalog of Fishes recognizes 94 species in 16 genera.

<text>A chain of title is the sequence of historical transfers of title to a property. It is a valuable tool to identify and document past owners of a property and serves as a property&#x27;s historical ownership timeline. The &quot;chain&quot; runs from the present owner back to the original owner of the property. In situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain of title. To facilitate this, a record of title documents may be maintained by a registry office or civil law notary.

==Chain of title for real property==

Real estate is one field where the chain of title has considerable significance. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies&#x27; issue title insurance based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the chain of title is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments. US states have objected and even sued over this practice.

==Chain of title for copyrights, trademarks, and rights of publicity ==

In the motion picture industry, the chain of title involves the series of documentation which establishes proprietary rights in a film. The chain also applies to compilations in other fields, where many people have contributed to the project, thus acquiring authorship rights, or where materials were culled from many sources. Chain of title is extremely important to film purchasers and to film distributors, as it establishes the veracity of the owner&#x27;s proprietary rights (or rights under license) in the intellectual property in a film, book or encyclopedia.

Chain of title documentation can include:

* copyright clearances on music from the regional collecting society, and to a less common extent, footage of other films;
* trademark clearances;
* talent agreements, which should incorporate a legal release from the talent, be they actors (including crowds), directors, cinematographers, choreographers, or others, to use their works, images, likeness and other personality rights in the film;
* proof of errors and omission insurance (a special form of insurance for motion picture producers which covers omissions in obtaining adequate chain of title).

Specialist organizations engage in the production of copyright property reports for motion picture studios, which cover original or unexploited works, and include the results of United States Copyright Office screening searches, author claimant searches, registration renewal searches and assignment searches. This involves reviewing US Copyright Office records from 1870 to present and numerous trade publications and databases, and Library of Congress records.

<doc id="226812" wikidata="Q310445" url="?curid=226812" title="Minamoto no Yoshitsune">
<text>was a commander of the Minamoto clan of Japan in the late Heian and early Kamakura periods. During the Genpei War, he led a series of battles that toppled the Ise-Heishi branch of the Taira clan, helping his half-brother Yoritomo consolidate power. He is considered one of the greatest and the most popular warriors of his era, and one of the most famous samurai in the history of Japan. Yoshitsune perished after being betrayed by the son of a trusted ally and was labelled as a tragic hero.

== Early life ==
Yoshitsune was the ninth son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo, and the third and final son and child that Yoshitomo would father with Tokiwa Gozen. Yoshitsune&#x27;s older half-brother Minamoto no Yoritomo (the third son of Yoshitomo) would go on to establish the Kamakura shogunate. Yoshitsune&#x27;s name in childhood was Ushiwakamaru or &quot;young bull&quot; (). He was born just before the Heiji Rebellion in 1160 in which his father and two oldest brothers were killed. He survived this incident by fleeing the capital with his mother, while his half-brother Yoritomo was banished to Izu Province. When he was 10, Yoshitsune was placed in the care of the monks of Kurama temple (), nestled in the Hiei Mountains near the capital of Kyoto. There he was taught swordsmanship and strategy, according to some legends by Sōjōbō, to others by Kiichi Hōgen (whose book, &quot;Six Secret Teachings&quot;, Ushiwakamaru stole). Not wanting to become a monk, Yoshitsune eventually left and followed a gold merchant who knew his father well, and in 1174 relocated to Hiraizumi, Mutsu Province, where he was put under the protection of Fujiwara no Hidehira, head of the powerful regional Northern Fujiwara clan.

== Career ==

A skillful swordsman, Yoshitsune defeated the legendary warrior monk Benkei in a duel. From then on, Benkei became Yoshitsune&#x27;s retainer, eventually dying with him at the Siege of Koromogawa.

In 1180, Yoshitsune heard that Yoritomo, now head of the Minamoto clan, had raised an army at the request of Prince Mochihito to fight against the Taira clan (also known as the Heike) which had usurped the power of the emperor. In the ensuing war between the rival Minamoto and Taira samurai clans, known as the Genpei War, Yoshitsune joined Yoritomo, along with Minamoto no Noriyori, all brothers who had not previously met.

Yoshitsune, together with his brother Noriyori, defeated the Taira in several key battles. He also attacked and killed his cousin Minamoto no Yoshinaka, a rival for control of the Minamoto clan, at the Battle of Awazu in Ōmi Province in early 1184 on the orders of Yoritomo.

Yoshitsune, who had by then been given the rank of general, went on to defeat the Taira at the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani in present-day Kobe in March 1184, and again at the Battle of Yashima in Shikoku in March 1185. He finally destroyed them one month later at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture.

Yoshitsune, was then given Ōmi Province for him to govern, after the Battle of Awazu.

== Final years ==
Following the Genpei War, Yoshitsune was appointed as Governor of Iyo and awarded other titles by cloistered emperor Go-Shirakawa. His suspicious brother Yoritomo, however, opposed the presentation of these titles, and nullified them.
Yoshitsune then secured imperial authorization to ally with his uncle Minamoto no Yukiie in opposing Yoritomo. Incurring Yoritomo&#x27;s wrath, Yoshitsune fled Kyoto in 1185. His faithful mistress, Shizuka Gozen, carrying his unborn child, fled with him at first, but then was left behind, and soon taken into custody by forces loyal to Yoritomo.

Yoshitsune eventually made his way to Hiraizumi, Mutsu, once again to the protection of Fujiwara no Hidehira, and lived undisturbed for a time. Hidehira&#x27;s son Fujiwara no Yasuhira had promised upon Hidehira&#x27;s death to honor his father&#x27;s wishes and continue to shelter Yoshitsune, but, giving in to pressure from Yoritomo, betrayed Yoshitsune, surrounding his Koromogawa-no-tachi residence with his troops, defeating Yoshitsune&#x27;s retainers, including Benkei (in a famous &quot;standing death&quot;), and forcing Yoshitsune to commit seppuku. Yasuhira then had Yoshitsune&#x27;s head preserved in sake, placed in a black-lacquered chest, and sent to Yoritomo as proof of his death. Historical sources differ as to the fate of Yoshitsune&#x27;s mistress Shizuka and their son.

Yoshitsune is enshrined in the Shirahata Jinja, a Shinto shrine in the city of Fujisawa.

== Rumors and legend ==
The death of Yoshitsune has been very elusive. According to Ainu historical accounts, he did not perform seppuku, but instead escaped the siege at Koromogawa, fleeing to Hokkaido and assuming the name Okikurumi/Oinakamui. An alternative legend states that after evading death, Yoshitsune made his way past Hokkaido and sailed to the mainland of Asia, re-surfacing as Genghis Khan. This story was invented by Suematsu Kenchō (1855–1920) while he was studying at Cambridge University in 1879, with the aim of improving Japanese prestige in the wake of the Meiji Restoration.

There&#x27;s a temple Henshoji in Mooka, Tochigi. According to an old temple magazine and tradition, Hitachibō Kaison entrusted a monk Hitachi Nyūdō Nensai with a child of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Keiwaka, as demanded by Fujiwara Hidehira. Furthermore, according to the tradition of Enmyō-ji temple in Hirosaki, Aomori, Chitose Maru, also known as Keiwakamaru was a child of Yoshitsune, entrusted to Date Tomomune by Kaison. After the adoption Kaison disappeared.

== Koshigoe Letter ==
The &quot;Koshigoe Letter&quot; was written by Yoshitsune on the 24th day of the 5th month of the second year of Genryaku (June 23, 1185) as he waited in Koshigoe for approval from Yoritomo to enter Kamakura. The letter was Yoshitsune&#x27;s &quot;final appeal&quot; to Yoritomo of his loyalty. The letter is a &quot;mixture of bravado and an almost masochistic indulgence in misfortune.&quot; An excerpt:
== In literature ==

Yoshitsune has long been a popular figure in Japanese literature and culture due to his appearance as the main character in the third section of the Japanese literary classic &quot;Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike)&quot;. The Japanese term for &quot;sympathy for a tragic hero&quot;, , comes from Yoshitsune&#x27;s title &quot;Kurō Hōgan&quot; (), which he received from the Imperial Court.

Many of the literary pieces that Yoshitsune appears in are legend rather than historical fact. Legends pertaining to Yoshitsune first began to appear in the fourteenth century. In early works at that time, Yoshitsune was described as a sharp-witted military leader. Then, romantic stories about his early childhood and last years of his life appeared as people began to know more about him.

The legends that deal with his public career show Yoshitsune as a great, virtuous warrior. He was often shown as kind to those around him and honorable, but was also shown to be naive.

Legends dealing with Yoshitsune&#x27;s childhood show young Yoshitsune (or Ushiwakamaru) with heroic qualities. He is portrayed as a brave and skilled swordsman, despite being a young boy. He was also skilled in music and his studies, and was also said to be able to easily sway the hearts of young women. These legends delve into fantasy more so than the legends about his later life.

Legends which pertain to the time when his half-brother, Yoritomo, turned against him take away some of Yoshitsune&#x27;s heroic qualities. He is no longer portrayed as a great warrior, but he retains his knowledge and skills that are valuable in the emperor&#x27;s court.

Yoshitsune&#x27;s escape through the Ataka barrier is the subject of Noh play &quot;Ataka&quot; and the Kabuki play &quot;Kanjinchō&quot;. &quot;Kanjinchō&quot; was later dramatized by Akira Kurosawa in the 1945 movie &quot;The Men Who Tread on the Tiger&#x27;s Tail&quot;.

The &quot;Gikeiki&quot;, or &quot;Chronicle of Yoshitsune&quot; relates events of Yoshitsune&#x27;s life after the defeat of the Heike.

==Family==
* Father: Minamoto no Yoshitomo
* Mother: Tokiwa Gozen
* Wife: Sato Gozen (1168–1189)
* Concubine: Shizuka Gozen

== Traditional arts ==
In addition to The Tale of the Heike and &quot;Gikeiki&quot;, a great many other works of literature and drama feature him, and together form the &quot;sekai&quot; (&quot;world&quot;) of Yoshitsune, a concept akin to the notion of the literary cycle.

These include:
* &quot;Yoshitsune Shin Takadachi&quot; (&quot;jōruri&quot;)
* &quot;Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura&quot; (&quot;jōruri&quot; and kabuki)
* &quot;Kanjinchō&quot; (kabuki)

In the visual arts, Yoshitsune is commonly depicted as a &quot;bishōnen&quot;, though this is at odds with contemporary descriptions of his appearance.

<text>This article lists notable literary events and publications in 1599.

==Events==
*January – English poet Edmund Spenser is buried near Geoffrey Chaucer at Westminster Abbey, beginning the tradition of Poets&#x27; Corner.
*Spring/Summer – The Globe Theatre is built in Southwark, at this time beyond the jurisdiction of the London city authorities, utilising material from The Theatre.
*June 4 – The Bishops&#x27; Ban of 1599: Middleton&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Marston&#x27;s &quot;Scourge of Villainy&quot; are publicly burned as the English ecclesiastical authorities crack down on the craze for satire in the past year. Richard Bancroft, Bishop of London and John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury tighten their enforcement of existing censorship. Earlier, minor works like pamphlets and plays were being published only with the approval of the Wardens of the Stationers Company and without ecclesiastical review; this arrangement is terminated.
*June 7 – John Day kills fellow playwright Henry Porter, allegedly in self-defence.
*September 21 – The first recorded performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; takes place at the Globe Theatre in London, according to the Swiss traveller Thomas Platter the Younger.
*Late – War of the Theatres: Satire, being prohibited in print, breaks out in the London theatres. In &quot;Histriomastix&quot;, Marston satirizes Jonson&#x27;s pride through the character Chrisoganus; Jonson responds by satirizing Marstons&#x27;s wordy style in &quot;Every Man out of His Humour&quot;, acted by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men.
*The English comic actor Will Kempe leaves the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men earlier in the year, probably to be replaced by the end of it by Robert Armin.
*King James VI of Scotland arranges for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in his country.
*The first printing in England of Richard de Bury&#x27;s &quot; The Philobiblon&quot; (1345) is made by Oxford bibliophile Thomas James.

==Events==
*February – Pembroke&#x27;s Men contract with Francis Langley to play the next year at his new Swan Theatre in London.
*By March – &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; becomes the first of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to be published as a &quot;bad quarto&quot;.
*March 17 – After the death of William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham on March 5, his place as Lord Chamberlain of England is taken by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, son of a previous Lord Chamberlain. Lord Hunsdon reverses Cobham&#x27;s policy of hostility toward the actors in English Renaissance theatre and returns to his father&#x27;s policy of general tolerance and patronage. The playing company under his patronage, which includes William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage, becomes the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men.
*April 23 – The feast for the Order of the Garter at the Palace of Whitehall in London is a likely occasion for the first performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.

*July – The season goes disastrously wrong for Pembroke&#x27;s Men, when they stage the scandalous play &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot; in London. This provokes the authorities to close all of the London theatres for the remainder of the summer. Ben Jonson, co-writer of the play with Thomas Nashe, is arrested on the orders of Queen Elizabeth I of England&#x27;s &quot;interrogator&quot;, Richard Topcliffe, briefly jailed in Marshalsea Prison, and charged with &quot;Leude and mutynous behavior&quot;.

<text>This article is a summary of the literary events and publications of 1595.

==Events==
*May 24 – The &quot;Nomenclator&quot; of Leiden University Library appears as the first printed catalog of an institutional library.
*December 9 – Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; is possibly acted privately at the Canon Row house of Sir Edward Hoby, with Sir Robert Cecil attending.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot;
**The first part of Ginés Pérez de Hita&#x27;s &quot;Historia de los bandos de los Zegríes y Abencerrajes (Guerras civiles de Granada)&quot; appears. Supposedly a chronicle of the Morisco rebellions in Granada based on an Arabic original, it is probably the earliest historical novel and certainly the first to gain popularity.
**Lope de Vega leaves the service of the Duke of Alba and returns to Madrid, after the death of his first wife Isabel in the previous year.

<text>This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in 1593.

==Events==
*Ongoing – London theatres remain closed for almost the whole year as a result of the previous year&#x27;s outbreak of bubonic plague. In the summer, Edward Alleyn and other actors make a provincial tour. Some performances take place in the winter, when plague tends to abate. Lord Strange&#x27;s Men act three times in January a play called &quot;Titus&quot; – perhaps Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;.
*After April – William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; probably becomes his first published work, printed from his own manuscript. In his lifetime it will be his most frequently reprinted work: at least nine times.
*May 5 – &quot;Dutch church libel&quot; bills posted in London threaten Protestant refugees from France and the Netherlands, alluding to Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s plays.
*May 12 – The English dramatist Thomas Kyd is arrested over the &quot;Dutch church libel&quot;. &quot;Atheist&quot; literature found in his home is claimed to be Marlowe&#x27;s.
*May 18 – A warrant for the arrest of Christopher Marlowe is issued. On May 20 he presents himself to the Privy Council.
*May 29 – The Welsh-born Protestant John Penry is executed for involvement in the Marprelate Controversy.

<text>In physics, in particular in special relativity and general relativity, a four-velocity is a four-vector in four-dimensional spacetime that represents the relativistic counterpart of velocity, which is a three-dimensional vector in space.

Physical events correspond to mathematical points in time and space, the set of all of them together forming a mathematical model of physical four-dimensional spacetime. The history of an object traces a curve in spacetime, called its world line. If the object has mass, so that its speed is necessarily less than the speed of light, the world line may be parametrized by the proper time of the object. The four-velocity is the rate of change of four-position with respect to the proper time along the curve. The velocity, in contrast, is the rate of change of the position in (three-dimensional) space of the object, as seen by an observer, with respect to the observer&#x27;s time.

The value of the magnitude of an object&#x27;s four-velocity, i.e. the quantity obtained by applying the metric tensor to the four-velocity , that is , is always equal to , where is the speed of light. Whether the plus or minus sign applies depends on the choice of metric signature. For an object at rest its four-velocity is parallel to the direction of the time coordinate with . A four-velocity is thus the normalized future-directed timelike tangent vector to a world line, and is a contravariant vector. Though it is a vector, addition of two four-velocities does not yield a four-velocity: the space of four-velocities is not itself a vector space.

== Velocity ==

The path of an object in three-dimensional space (in an inertial frame) may be expressed in terms of three spatial coordinate functions of time , where is an index which takes values 1, 2, 3.

The three coordinates form the 3d position vector, written as a column vector
formula_1

The components of the velocity formula_2 (tangent to the curve) at any point on the world line are

formula_3

Each component is simply written
formula_4

== Theory of relativity ==

In Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, the path of an object moving relative to a particular frame of reference is defined by four coordinate functions , where is a spacetime index which takes the value 0 for the timelike component, and 1, 2, 3 for the spacelike coordinates. The zeroth component is defined as the time coordinate multiplied by ,
formula_5 

Each function depends on one parameter &quot;τ&quot; called its proper time. As a column vector,
formula_6

=== Time dilation ===

From time dilation, the differentials in coordinate time and proper time are related by
formula_7
where the Lorentz factor,
formula_8
is a function of the Euclidean norm of the 3d velocity vector 
formula_9

=== Definition of the four-velocity ===

The four-velocity is the tangent four-vector of a timelike world line.
The four-velocity formula_10 at any point of world line formula_11 is defined as:
formula_12
where formula_13 is the four-position and formula_14 is the proper time.

The four-velocity defined here using the proper time of an object does not exist for world lines for massless objects such as photons travelling at the speed of light; nor is it defined for tachyonic world lines, where the tangent vector is spacelike.

=== Components of the four-velocity ===

The relationship between the time and the coordinate time is defined by
formula_15

Taking the derivative of this with respect to the proper time , we find the velocity component for :
formula_16

and for the other 3 components to proper time we get the velocity component for :
formula_17
where we have used the chain rule and the relationships
formula_18

Thus, we find for the four-velocity 
formula_19

Written in standard four-vector notation this is:
formula_20
where formula_21 is the temporal component and formula_22 is the spatial component.

In terms of the synchronized clocks and rulers associated with a particular slice of flat spacetime, the three spacelike components of four-velocity define a traveling object&#x27;s proper velocity formula_23 i.e. the rate at which distance is covered in the reference map frame per unit proper time elapsed on clocks traveling with the object.

Unlike most other four-vectors, the four-velocity has only 3 independent components formula_24 instead of 4. The formula_25 factor is a function of the three-dimensional velocity formula_2.

When certain Lorentz scalars are multiplied by the four-velocity, one then gets new physical four-vectors that have 4 independent components.

For example:
* Four-momentum: formula_27 where formula_28 is the rest mass
* Four-current density: formula_29 where formula_30 is the charge density

Effectively, the formula_25 factor combines with the Lorentz scalar term to make the 4th independent component
formula_32 and formula_33

=== Magnitude ===
Using the differential of the four-position in the rest frame, the magnitude of the four-velocity can be obtained by the Minkowski metric with signature :
formula_34
in short, the magnitude of the four-velocity for any object is always a fixed constant:
formula_35

In a moving frame, the same norm is:
formula_36
so that:
formula_37

which reduces to the definition of the Lorentz factor.

<doc id="226841" wikidata="Q2283172" url="?curid=226841" title="Four-acceleration">
<text>In the theory of relativity, four-acceleration is a four-vector (vector in four-dimensional spacetime) that is analogous to classical acceleration (a three-dimensional vector, see three-acceleration in special relativity). Four-acceleration has applications in areas such as the annihilation of antiprotons, resonance of strange particles and radiation of an accelerated charge.

== Four-acceleration in inertial coordinates ==

In inertial coordinates in special relativity, four-acceleration formula_1 is defined as the rate of change in four-velocity formula_2 with respect to the particle&#x27;s proper time along its worldline. We can say:
formula_3
where
* formula_4 , with formula_5 the three-acceleration and formula_6 the three-velocity, and 
* formula_7 and
* formula_8 is the Lorentz factor for the speed formula_9 (with formula_10). A dot above a variable indicates a derivative with respect to the coordinate time in a given reference frame, not the proper time formula_11 (in other terms, formula_12).

In an instantaneously co-moving inertial reference frame formula_13, formula_14 and formula_15, i.e. in such a reference frame 
formula_16

Geometrically, four-acceleration is a curvature vector of a worldline.

Therefore, the magnitude of the four-acceleration (which is an invariant scalar) is equal to the proper acceleration that a moving particle &quot;feels&quot; moving along a worldline. A worldline having constant four-acceleration is a Minkowski-circle i.e. hyperbola (see &quot;hyperbolic motion&quot;)

The scalar product of a particle&#x27;s four-velocity and its four-acceleration is always 0.

Even at relativistic speeds four-acceleration is related to the four-force: formula_17 where is the invariant mass of a particle.

When the four-force is zero, only gravitation affects the trajectory of a particle, and the four-vector equivalent of Newton&#x27;s second law above reduces to the geodesic equation. The four-acceleration of a particle executing geodesic motion is zero. This corresponds to gravity not being a force. Four-acceleration is different from what we understand by acceleration as defined in Newtonian physics, where gravity is treated as a force.

== Four-acceleration in non-inertial coordinates ==

In non-inertial coordinates, which include accelerated coordinates in special relativity and all coordinates in general relativity, the acceleration four-vector is related to the four-velocity through an absolute derivative with respect to proper time.

formula_18

In inertial coordinates the Christoffel symbols formula_19 are all zero, so this formula is compatible with the formula given earlier.

In special relativity the coordinates are those of a rectilinear inertial frame, so the Christoffel symbols term vanishes, but sometimes when authors use curved coordinates in order to describe an accelerated frame, the frame of reference isn&#x27;t inertial, they will still describe the physics as special relativistic because the metric is just a frame transformation of the Minkowski space metric. In that case this is the expression that must be used because the Christoffel symbols are no longer all zero.

<text>Ken Park is a 2002 erotic psychological thriller film directed by Larry Clark and Edward Lachman. Set in the city of Visalia, California, it revolves around the abusive and dysfunctional lives of four teenagers following the suicide of their mutual acquaintance, the eponymous Ken Park. It was written by Harmony Korine, who based it on Clark&#x27;s journals and stories. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 10, 2002, but has not been officially shown in the United States since. It was also banned in Australia due to its content.

==Plot==
The title character Ken Park (nicknamed &quot;Krap Nek&quot;: his name spelled and pronounced backward), is a teenager skateboarding across Visalia, California. He arrives at a skate park, where he casually sets up a camcorder, smiles, and shoots himself in the temple with a handgun. His death is used to bookend the film, which follows the lives of four other teenagers who knew him.

Shawn is the most stable of the four main characters. Throughout the story, he has an ongoing sexual relationship with his girlfriend&#x27;s mother Rhonda, whom he tells that he fantasizes about being with while having sex with her daughter, Hannah. He casually socializes with their family, the rest of whom are completely unaware of the affair.

Claude fends off physical and emotional abuse from his alcoholic father, who detests him for not being masculine enough, all while he tries to care for his pregnant mother, who makes little to no attempt at defending him. However, after coming home drunk one night, he attempts to perform oral sex on Claude, prompting the boy to run away from home.

Peaches is a girl who lives alone with her obsessive and highly-religious father, who fixates on her as the innocent embodiment of her deceased mother. When he catches her having sex with her boyfriend Curtis – whom she has playfully tied to her bed – he beats the boy and savagely disciplines her, then forces her to participate in a quasi-incestuous wedding ritual with him.

Tate is an unstable and sadistic adolescent living with his grandparents, whom he resents and abuses verbally. He engages in autoerotic asphyxiation while masturbating to a video of a woman playing tennis. He eventually kills his grandparents, in retaliation for petty grievances, and finds that it arouses him sexually. He records himself on his tape recorder so that the police will know how and why he did it, puts his grandfather&#x27;s dentures in his mouth, lies naked in his bed, and falls asleep; eventually being found and promptly arrested.

The film cuts frequently between these subplots, with no overlap of characters or events until the end, when Shawn, Claude, and Peaches meet and have a threesome. In a game of &quot;who am I?&quot; afterward, they refer to an unnamed person they know who is now dead. The film cuts to a title screen, followed by a flashback to before the opening scene. Ken has impregnated his girlfriend and taken a menial job. At the skate park, they discuss whether to abort the pregnancy, and she asks Ken rhetorically if he is glad his mother did not abort him; he does not answer.

==Production==
Clark attempted to write the first script for &quot;Ken Park&quot;, basing it on personal experiences and people with whom he had grown up. Dissatisfied with his own draft, he hired Harmony Korine to pen the screenplay.

Korine explained the writing of the film in a 2005 interview:&quot;Ken Park was written right after &quot;Kids&quot;, before we had gotten the financing for &quot;Kids&quot;. Larry Clark realized I could write pretty well and that I understood a certain type of vernacular, the teenage vernacular. So he wrote down five things he wanted to see on a napkin in red ink. [...] They were things that he wanted to see. Five images that he wanted to see, and with those images he wanted me to construct a basic narrative, like a certain kind of narrative. I wasn&#x27;t interested in telling a kind of elliptical narrative, I wanted to deconstruct some stories. At that point, it was written literally right after I wrote Kids.&quot;

Clark ultimately used most of Korine&#x27;s script, but rewrote the ending. The arrangement was to film using digital video, but Clark and Lachman used 35mm film instead.

==Distribution==
Although it was sold for distribution to some 30 countries, the film was not shown in the United Kingdom after director Larry Clark assaulted Hamish McAlpine, the head of the UK distributor for the film, Metro-Tartan. Clark alleged that McAlpine had said the September 11 attacks were &quot;the best thing to ever happened to America&quot; and that Israeli victims of Palestinian suicide bombers &quot;deserved to die.&quot; McAlpine denied the accusations. Clark was arrested and spent several hours in custody, and McAlpine was left with a broken nose. The film has not been released in the United States since its initial showing at the Telluride Film Festival in 2002. Clark says that this is because of the producer&#x27;s failure to get copyright releases for the music used. The film was banned in Australia due to its graphic sexual content and portrayals of underage sexual activity after it was refused a classification by the Australian Classification Board in 2003. A protest screening held in Sydney, hosted by film critic Margaret Pomeranz, was shut down by the police.

==Critical reception==
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 46% approval rating with an average score of 4.80/10 based on 13 reviews. Ed Gonzales of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; noted some redeeming elements in an &quot;otherwise familiar &quot;Kids&quot; procedural&quot; in which &quot;the parents are all monsters of some kind and there&#x27;s an excuse for every teenager&#x27;s bad behavior&quot;. Rob Gonsalves of &quot;eFilmCritic&quot;, wrote that the film &quot;is about people lost in a haze of contempt and despair, trying to wrest some love or relief out of the situation.&quot; Michael Rechtshaffen of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described it as &quot;a ragingly controversial feature that makes it very tricky to distinguish between insightful and incite-ful.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;Beautifully crafted but emotionally dispiriting and alienating in its insistence on spotlighting only the negative aspects of life&quot;. Lee Marshall of &quot;Screen Daily&quot; wrote that &quot;Clark, being Clark, pushes things a little too far; so a not entirely constructive tension is set up between the need to show and the desire to shock.&quot;

<doc id="226843" wikidata="Q762446" url="?curid=226843" title="Comparison of multi-paradigm programming languages">
<text>Programming languages can be grouped by the number and types of paradigms supported.

==Paradigm summaries==
A concise reference for the programming paradigms listed in this article.
* Concurrent programming – have language constructs for concurrency, these may involve multi-threading, support for distributed computing, message passing, shared resources (including shared memory), or futures
** Actor programming – concurrent computation with &quot;actors&quot; that make local decisions in response to the environment (capable of selfish or competitive behaviour)
* Constraint programming – relations between variables are expressed as constraints (or constraint networks), directing allowable solutions (uses constraint satisfaction or simplex algorithm)
* Dataflow programming – forced recalculation of formulas when data values change (e.g. spreadsheets)
* Declarative programming – describes what computation should perform, without specifying detailed state changes c.f. imperative programming (functional and logic programming are major subgroups of declarative programming)
* Distributed programming – have support for multiple autonomous computers that communicate via computer networks
* Functional programming – uses evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data
* Generic programming – uses algorithms written in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then instantiated as needed for specific types provided as parameters
* Imperative programming – explicit statements that change a program state
* Logic programming – uses explicit mathematical logic for programming
* Metaprogramming – writing programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise be done at runtime
** Template metaprogramming – metaprogramming methods in which a compiler uses templates to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled
** Reflective programming – metaprogramming methods in which a program modifies or extends itself
* Object-oriented programming – uses data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions (objects) to design programs
** Class-based – object-oriented programming in which inheritance is achieved by defining classes of objects, versus the objects themselves
** Prototype-based – object-oriented programming that avoids classes and implements inheritance via cloning of instances
* Pipeline programming – a simple syntax change to add syntax to nest function calls to language originally designed with none
* Rule-based programming – a network of rules of thumb that comprise a knowledge base and can be used for expert systems and problem deduction &amp; resolution
* Visual programming – manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually (e.g. Simulink); also termed &quot;diagrammatic programming&quot;

<text>Azores Airlines, previously known as SATA Internacional, is a Portuguese airline based in the municipality of Ponta Delgada, on the island of São Miguel in the autonomous archipelago of the Azores. A subsidiary of SATA Air Açores, the airline operates as the international arm of the regional network, connecting the archipelago intercontinentally from its hub at João Paulo II Airport. The company operate flights as well from its base in Lisbon.

==History==

===Early years===

The airline was first established in March 1990 under the name of OceanAir and in 1995 was authorized to operate air transport services as a non-scheduled carrier. SATA Air Açores became the major shareholder when OceanAir suspended service in 1994. It later became the sole owner, and on 20 February 1998 it was re-branded as SATA Internacional, resuming operations on 8 April 1998. The airline became a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo SATA, which also operates SATA Air Açores.

Following its bid by public tender, SATA Internacional was awarded scheduled routes from Ponta Delgada to Lisbon, Madeira Island and Porto. SATA would later own two tour operators in North America: SATA Express in Canada and Azores Express in the United States.

===21st century===

In May 2009, SATA adopted a new brand image and a new logo which was applied to its first new Airbus A320-200, registered CS-TKO and named &quot;Diáspora&quot;. The new scheme was adopted by both SATA Internacional and SATA Air Açores during the fleet upgrades beginning at the end of the 1990s and lasted until 2015.

In January 2015, the airline announced strategic plans to reduce its debts from €179 million to €40 million by 2020 by reducing its fleet and workforce. Under the plan it would also be renamed to Azores Airlines. In October 2015, SATA Internacional subsequently announced a major rebranding, including the name change to Azores Airlines and a change of the colour scheme from blue tones to green tones. At the same time, a fleet renewal with Airbus A330 aircraft had been announced. The first A330 commercial flight took place on 25 March 2016 from Ponta Delgada to Boston.

In September 2016, the airline announced a change of plans regarding its fleet renewal. While plans to phase in a second Airbus A330 were later cancelled, Azores Airlines ordered two Airbus A321neo on interim lease for 2017-2019 and four Airbus A321LRs to be delivered in 2019 to replace the interim A321neos. The A310 fleet was fully retired in October 2018, after which the airline&#x27;s fleet was composed entirely of narrowbody Airbus aircraft. In July 2019, the airline received its first Airbus A321LR. However, by the end of 2019 when the airline had been expected to return the A321neos, it had retained them instead.

In January 2021, an Airbus A321LR operating Azores Airlines Flight S46865 claimed the record for the longest commercial A321LR flight by duration, which operated as a charter from Lisbon to Bogotá in a time of 9 hours and 49 minutes. The airline surpassed the record previously set by Air Transat for its A321LR flight on 26 October 2020 from Montréal Trudeau to Athens, taking a duration of 8 hours and 20 minutes, but was later surpassed by TAP Air Portugal on 29 March 2021 with its A321LR flight from Maputo to Praia, for a flight duration of 10 hours and 7 minutes.

==Destinations==

Azores Airlines operates scheduled domestic flights from the Azores to the Madeira Islands and mainland Portugal, and international flights from the Azores to destinations in Africa, Europe and North America, as well as charter flights. Regional flights within the Azores are operated by its parent company, SATA Air Açores.

===Interline agreements===
Azores Airlines has interlining agreements with the following airlines:

*Alaska Airlines
*JetBlue
*Porter Airlines
*SATA Air Açores
===Codeshare agreements===
Azores Airlines has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:

*Air France
*TAP Air Portugal
*WestJet
==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
, Azores Airlines operates the following aircraft in its all-Airbus fleet:

Smaller aircraft are operated by parent SATA Air Açores under its own air operator&#x27;s certificate, while longer-range aircraft operating flights for Azores Airlines may be seasonally wet-leased.

===Historical fleet===
Azores Airlines has previously operated the following aircraft:

==Liveries==
The airline over its history as SATA Internacional and later as Azores Airlines has iterated various liveries.

===SATA Internacional liveries===

The airline&#x27;s original livery consisted of an all white fuselage with the name &quot;SATA Internacional&quot; in ocean blue over the front windows, and a dark blue tail with the company logo. Before this, the livery had an idealised logo featuring the bands of crashing waves, superimposed by a sun-disk, with the calligraphic lettering &quot;Fly Azores&quot; below. This tourist-friendly logo was retired at the end of the 20th century, to be replaced with a more corporate image.

The airline as well as its parent company SATA Air Açores adopted new branding in 2009, which included an idealised bird symbol as the new logo. The symbol, called BIA (for &quot;Blue Islands Açor&quot;), consisted of nine geometrical shapes, representing the nine islands of the Azores assembled to form the mythical &quot;Açor&quot; of Portuguese legend. The &quot;açor&quot; or &quot;northern goshawk&quot; was thought to have been the bird found circling the islands of the Azores when Portuguese sailors first discovered the archipelago. This form appeared on the tail fin, in addition to a portion located just ahead of the wings on the fuselage.

===Azores Airlines liveries===
Following the airline&#x27;s rebranding in 2015 from SATA Internacional to Azores Airlines, the new branding consisted of a change from blue tones to green tones, and the airline&#x27;s previous açor symbol was changed to a symbol resembling a whale&#x27;s tail exposed above the ocean surface, though like the previous symbol was also of nine geometrical shapes. The main elements of the new branding on the airline&#x27;s livery consisted of the word &quot;Azores&quot; written on the aircraft tailfin, the whale tail symbol appearing on the tailfin, engines, and within the airline&#x27;s name written on the forward fuselage. The airline&#x27;s first Airbus A330-200 additionally featured a decal of a sperm whale on the main fuselage, with the whale tail symbol and logo also appearing on the wingtips.

In 2017, the airline introduced revisions to its branding and livery upon the delivery of its first Airbus A321neo aircraft, which involved abandoning the green tones in the airline&#x27;s wordmark and logo in favor of the blue tones originally adopted in 2009, but maintaining the use of the whale tail logo. The wingtips also featured blue geometrical shapes resembling the logo. On the airline&#x27;s Airbus A321neos and A321LRs, the fuselage prominently features a word, consisting of either &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Wonder&quot;, &quot;Magical&quot;, &quot;Inspire&quot; or &quot;Peaceful&quot; in a different colour, accompanied by the text, &quot;That&#x27;s the feeling when you visit Azores.&quot; in a matching colour. The airline&#x27;s name, logo, and associated websites are also written on either side at the forward and rear boarding doors. The airline&#x27;s A321neos and the first of two A321LRs collectively delivered between 2017 and 2019 additionally feature a QR code leading to the airline&#x27;s website.

In late 2020, the airline&#x27;s second Airbus A321LR featured further revisions to the branding and livery, consisting of the removal of the QR code, and abandoning the use of the whale tail logo in favor of a modified version of the original açor logo adopted in 2009. On the fuselage, the revised version of the livery includes the airline&#x27;s wordmark written behind the forward boarding door, while the logo is placed between the boarding door and the cockpit windows. On the aircraft tail fin, the açor logo is enlarged compared to previous iterations, with the word &quot;Azores&quot; written in white along the rear edge of the tail fin, while the rest of the tail fin is coloured in dark blue. The airline&#x27;s Airbus A320 aircraft were repainted to match the branding, each one with the word &quot;Natural&quot;, &quot;Dream&quot; and &quot;Unique&quot; written prominently on their respective fuselages.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 4 August 2009, a SATA Internacional Airbus A320-200 operating flight S4-129 from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada bounced off the runway then subsequently experienced a severe hard landing of 4.86g, causing damage to the landing gear. Nothing was written in the aircraft&#x27;s technical maintenance log, both flight crew and maintenance staff were unable to interpret the hard landing report and despite the damage, the aircraft was not removed from service and flew back to Lisbon in customer service as well as flying an additional 6 sectors. SATA said in a statement that the hard landing/load reports are not a mandatory requirement for the aircraft type and drew attention to the amount of time Airbus took to confirm to them the interpretation of the load report. Both landing gear legs subsequently had to be replaced. In their final report the Portuguese accident investigation authority the Aviation Accidents Prevention and Investigation Department determined that the primary cause of the incident was the ground spoilers deploying in flight after the aircraft had bounced 12 ft off the runway. Contributing factors were the failure of the pilot to go-around after the bounce, the failure of the pilot to release the thrust levers before the first touchdown (which inhibited the ground spoilers deploying) and the pilot providing insufficient flare input.

<doc id="226847" wikidata="Q793471" url="?curid=226847" title="Azadirachtin">
<text>Azadirachtin, a chemical compound belonging to the limonoid group, is a secondary metabolite present in neem seeds. It is a highly oxidized tetranortriterpenoid which boasts a plethora of oxygen-bearing functional groups, including an enol ether, acetal, hemiacetal, tetra-substituted epoxide and a variety of carboxylic esters.

== Chemical synthesis ==
Azadirachtin has a complex molecular structure; it presents both secondary and tertiary hydroxyl groups and a tetrahydrofuran ether in its molecular structure, alongside 16 stereogenic centres, 7 of which are tetrasubstituted. These characteristics explain the great difficulty encountered when trying to prepare this compound from simple precursors, using methods of synthetic organic chemistry.

Hence, the first total synthesis was published over 22 years after the compound&#x27;s discovery: this first synthesis was completed by the research group of Steven Ley at the University of Cambridge in 2007. The described synthesis was a relay approach, with the required, heavily functionalized decalin intermediate being made by total synthesis on a small scale, but being derived from the natural product itself for the gram-scale operations required to complete the synthesis.

== Occurrence and use ==
Initially found to be active as a feeding inhibitor towards the desert locust (&quot;Schistocerca gregaria&quot;), it is now known to affect over 200 species of insects, by acting mainly as an antifeedant and growth disruptor. Azadirachtin exhibits considerable toxicity towards African cotton leafworm (&quot;Spodoptera littoralis&quot;), which are resistant to a commonly used biological pesticide, &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;. Azadirachtin fulfills many of the criteria needed for a good insecticide. Azadirachtin is biodegradable (it degrades within 100 hours when exposed to light and water) and shows very low toxicity to mammals (the in rats is &gt; 3,540 mg/kg making it practically non-toxic).

This compound is found in the seeds (0.2 to 0.8 percent by weight) of the neem tree, &quot;Azadirachta indica&quot; (hence the prefix aza does not imply an aza compound, but refers to the scientific species name). Many more compounds, related to azadirachtin, are present in the seeds as well as in the leaves and the bark of the neem tree which also show strong biological activities among various pest insects Effects of these preparations on beneficial arthropods are generally considered to be minimal . Some laboratory and field studies have found neem extracts to be compatible with biological control. Because pure neem oil contains other insecticidal and fungicidal compounds in addition to azadirachtin, it is generally mixed at a rate of of water when used as a pesticide.

Azadirachtin is the active ingredient in many pesticides including TreeAzin, AzaMax, BioNEEM, AzaGuard, and AzaSol, Terramera Proof and Terramera Cirkil.

Azadirachtin has a synergistic effect with the biocontrol agent &quot;Beauveria&quot;.

Nimbecidine is a natural product insecticide mix which is mostly azadirachtin, with some other limonoids.

== Mechanism of action ==
Azadirachtin interferes with a wide variety of insect pathways.
* The substance acts as an insect growth regulator. It antagonizes both ecdysteroid (mainly 20E) and juvenile hormone activities by reducing secretion of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and allatotropins from the corpus cardiacum complex. This neuroendocrine disruption reduces pupation. It also causes degeneration of other neuroendocrine glands.
* The substance disrupts reproductive functions, going as far as sterility in some insects. This is partially due to the aforementioned neuroendocrine disruption surrounding 20E and JH. It could also affect yolk protein and vitallogenin synthesis. It also reduces mating success by deterrence.
* The substance also deters feeding, making it an antifeedant. It disrupts the sense of smell to the point that some insects would rather starve than eat azadirachtin-laced food. If the insect ingests the compound, the substance further inhibits digestive enzymes and could leave an aversive taste memory by activating dopaminergic neurons.
* Azadirachtin additionally has a long list of cellular and molecular targets. It upregulates p53, disrupts protein synthesis possibly through binding to Hsp60, and changes the expression of many other pathways.

== Biosynthesis ==
Azadirachtin is formed via an elaborate biosynthetic pathway, but is believed that the steroid tirucallol is the precursor to the neem triterpenoid secondary metabolites. Tirucallol is formed from two units of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form a C30 triterpene, but then loses three methyl groups to become a C27 steroid. Tirucallol undergoes an allylic isomerization to form butyrospermol, which is then oxidized. The oxidized butyrospermol subsequently rearranges via a Wagner-Meerwein 1,2-methyl shift to form apotirucallol.

Apotirucallol becomes a tetranortriterpenoid when the four terminal carbons from the side chain are cleaved off. The remaining carbons on the side chain cyclize to form a furan ring and the molecule is oxidized further to form azadirone and azadiradione. The third ring is then opened and oxidized to form the C-seco-limonoids such as nimbin, nimbidinin and salannin, which has been esterified with a molecule of tiglic acid, which is derived from L-isoleucine. It is currently proposed that the target molecule is arrived at by biosynthetically converting azadirone into salanin, which is then heavily oxidized and cyclized to reach azadirachtin.
