<text>The mitral valve ( ), also known as the bicuspid valve or left atrioventricular valve, is one of the four heart valves. It has two cusps or flaps and lies between the left atrium and the left ventricle of the heart. The heart valves are all one-way valves allowing blood flow in just one direction. The mitral valve and the tricuspid valve are known as the atrioventricular valves because they lie between the atria and the ventricles.

In normal conditions, blood flows through an open mitral valve during diastole with contraction of the left atrium, and the mitral valve closes during systole with contraction of the left ventricle. The valve opens and closes because of pressure differences, opening when there is greater pressure in the left atrium than ventricle and closing when there is greater pressure in the left ventricle than atrium.

In abnormal conditions, blood may flow backward through the valve (mitral regurgitation) or the mitral valve may be narrowed (mitral stenosis). Rheumatic heart disease often affects the mitral valve; the valve may also prolapse with age and be affected by infective endocarditis. The mitral valve is named after the mitre of a bishop, which resembles its flaps.

==Structure==

The mitral valve is typically in area and sits in the left heart between the left atrium and the left ventricle. It has two cusps: an anterior one, and a posterior one. The opening of the mitral valve is surrounded by a fibrous ring known as the mitral annulus. The anterior cusp attaches to one third of the circumverence of the annulus, and the posterior cusp attaches to the remaining two thirds of its circumference. The anterior cusp is thicker and more rigid than the posterior one, and covers approximately two-thirds of the valve. The anterior cusp intervenes between the mitral and aortic orifices. Although the anterior leaflet takes up a larger part of the ring and rises higher, the posterior leaflet has a larger surface area.

===Leaflets===

In Carpentier&#x27;s classification of a mitral valve, both the posterior and anterior mitral valve leaflets are divided into eight segments: P3 (medial scallop), P2 (central scallop), P1 (lateral scallop), A3 (anteromedial segment), A2 (anterocentral), A1 (anterolateral), PMC (posteromedial commissure), ALC (anterolateral commissure). Mitral leaflet thickness is usually about 1 mm but sometimes can range from 3–5 mm.

===Chordae tendineae===
The valve leaflets are prevented from prolapsing into the left atrium by the action of chordae tendineae. The chordae tendineae are inelastic tendons attached at one end to papillary muscles in the left ventricle, and at the other to the valve cusps. Papillary muscles are finger-like projections from the wall of the left ventricle.

When the left ventricle contracts, the pressure in the ventricle forces the valve to close, while the tendons keep the leaflets coapting together and prevent the valve from opening in the wrong direction (thus preventing blood flowing back to the left atrium). Each chord has a different thickness. The thinnest ones are attached to the free leaflet margin, whereas the thickest ones (strut chords) are attached further from the free margin. This disposition has important effects on systolic stress distribution physiology.

===Annulus===
The mitral annulus is a fibrous ring that is attached to the mitral valve leaflets. Unlike prosthetic valves, it is not continuous. The mitral annulus is saddle shaped and changes in shape throughout the cardiac cycle. The annulus contracts and reduces its surface area during systole to help provide complete closure of the leaflets. Expansion of the annulus can result in leaflets that do not join soundly together, leading to functional mitral regurgitation.

The normal diameter of the mitral annulus is , and the circumference is . Microscopically, there is no evidence of an annular structure anteriorly, where the mitral valve leaflet is contiguous with the posterior aortic root.

==Function==

During left ventricular diastole, after the pressure drops in the left ventricle due to relaxation of the ventricular myocardium, the mitral valve opens, and blood travels from the left atrium to the left ventricle. About 70 to 80% of the blood that travels across the mitral valve occurs during the &quot;early filling phase&quot; of the left ventricle. This early filling phase is due to active relaxation of the ventricular myocardium, causing a pressure gradient that allows a rapid flow of blood from the left atrium, across the mitral valve. This early filling across the mitral valve is seen on doppler echocardiography of the mitral valve as the &quot;E wave&quot;.

After the E wave, there is a period of slow filling of the ventricle.

Left atrial contraction (left atrial systole) (during left ventricular diastole) causes added blood to flow across the mitral valve immediately before left ventricular systole. This late flow across the open mitral valve is seen on doppler echocardiography of the mitral valve as the &quot;A wave&quot;. The late filling of the left ventricle contributes about 20% to the volume in the left ventricle prior to ventricular systole and is known as the &quot;atrial kick&quot;.

The mitral annulus changes in shape and size during the cardiac cycle. It is smaller at the end of atrial systole due to the contraction of the left atrium around it, like a sphincter. This reduction in annulus size at the end of atrial systole may be important for the proper coapting of the leaflets of the mitral valve when the left ventricle contracts and pumps blood. Leaking valves can be corrected by mitral valve annuloplasty, a common surgical procedure that aims at restoring proper leaflet adjustment.

==Clinical significance==
===Disease===
There are some valvular heart diseases that affect the mitral valve. Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the valve. This can be heard as an opening snap; a heart sound which is not normally present.

Classic mitral valve prolapse is caused by an excess of connective tissue that thickens the spongiosa layer of the cusp and separates collagen bundles in the fibrosa. This weakens the cusps and adjacent tissue, resulting in an increased cuspal area and lengthening of the chordae tendineae. Elongation of the chordae tendineae often causes rupture, commonly to the chordae attached to the posterior cusp. Advanced lesions—also commonly involving the posterior leaflet—lead to leaflet folding, inversion, and displacement toward the left atrium.

A valve prolapse can result in mitral insufficiency, which is the regurgitation or backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium due to the incomplete closure of the valve causing a systolic murmur heard at the apex of the heart. This increase in pressure in the left atrium and pulmonary circuit can lead to symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, and atrial fibrillation over time.

Rheumatic heart disease often affects the mitral valve. The valve may also be affected by infective endocarditis.

There are also some rarer forms of congenital mitral valve disease that are often associated with other congenital heart anomalies. Parachute mitral valve occurs when all chordae tendineae of the mitral valve are abnormally attached to a single (or fused) papillary muscle. Straddling Mitral Valve occurs when the mitral valve&#x27;s chordal attachments straddles, or goes through, a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and so has chordae originating on both sides of the ventricular septum. Mitral valve agenesis is very rare, defined as an absence or minimal presence of both mitral valve leaflets (complete agenesis) or one of the leaflets (partial agenesis). 

Surgery can be performed to replace or repair a damaged valve. A less invasive method is that of mitral valvuloplasty which uses a balloon catheter to open up a stenotic valve. Alternatively, the Lawrie technique is an option for patients who have less valve tissue available for repair as they may have damaged or fragile valve leaflets. During the Lawrie technique, artificial fabric chordae are used to repair the valve which spares the existing valve leaflets and chordae during the repair. 

Rarely there can be a severe form of calcification of the mitral valve annulus that can be mistaken for an intracardiac mass or thrombus.

Mitral disease can be classified using Carpentier&#x27;s classification which is based on the leaflet motion. Type I pertains to normal leaflet motion. Whereas, disease of the valve is categorized to primary mitral regurgitation or secondary mitral regurgitation based on the regurgitant etiology. Type II pertains to excessive leaflet motion leading to leaflet prolapse. Common causes include, but is not limited to, Barlow disease, myxomatous degeneration, inflammation, and papillary muscle rupture. Type III pertains to restrictive motion of the leaflets. Type IIIa pertains to restrictive motion during systole and diastole. Type IIIb pertains to restrictive motion during systole.

===Investigation===
The closing of the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve constitutes the first heart sound (S1), which can be heard with a stethoscope. It is not the valve closure itself which produces the sound but the sudden cessation of blood flow, when the mitral and tricuspid valves close.. Abnormalities associated with the mitral valve can often be heard when listening with a stethoscope.

The mitral valve is often also investigated using an ultrasound scan, which can reveal the size, anatomy and flow of blood through the valve.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;mitral&quot; comes from Latin, meaning &quot;shaped like a mitre&quot; (bishop&#x27;s hat). The word &quot;bicuspid&quot; uses combining forms of &quot;&quot;, from Latin, meaning &quot;double&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;point&quot;, reflecting the dual-flap shape of the valve.

<doc id="237416" wikidata="Q1344255" url="?curid=237416" title="Tricuspid valve">
<text>The tricuspid valve, or right atrioventricular valve, is on the right dorsal side of the mammalian heart, at the superior portion of the right ventricle. The function of the valve is to allow blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle during diastole, and to close to prevent backflow (regurgitation) from the right ventricle into the right atrium during right ventricular contraction (systole).

==Structure==
The tricuspid valve usually has three cusps or leaflets, named the anterior, posterior, and septal cusps. Each leaflet is connected via chordae tendineae to the anterior, posterior, and septal papillary muscles of the right ventricle, respectively. Tricuspid valves may also occur with two or four leaflets; the number may change over a lifetime.

==Function==

The tricuspid valve functions as a one-way valve that closes during ventricular systole to prevent regurgitation of blood from the right ventricle back into the right atrium. It opens during ventricular diastole, allowing blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. The back flow of blood is also known as regression or tricuspid regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation can result in increased ventricular preload because the blood refluxed back into the atrium is added to the volume of blood that must be pumped back into the ventricle during the next cycle of ventricular diastole. Increased right ventricular preload over a prolonged period of time may lead to right ventricular enlargement (dilatation), which can progress to right heart failure if left uncorrected.

== Clinical significance ==

Infected valves can result in endocarditis in intravenous drug users. Patients who inject narcotics or other drugs intravenously may introduce infection, which can travel to the right side of the heart, most often caused by the bacteria &quot;S. aureus&quot;. In patients without a history of intravenous exposure, endocarditis is more frequently left-sided.

The tricuspid valve can be affected by rheumatic fever, which can cause tricuspid stenosis or tricuspid regurgitation. Some individuals are born with congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve. Congenital apical displacement of the tricuspid valve is called Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly and typically causes significant tricuspid regurgitation.

Certain carcinoid syndromes can affect the tricuspid valve by producing fibrosis due to serotonin production by those tumors.

The first endovascular tricuspid valve implant was performed by surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic.
=== Tricuspid regurgitation ===

Tricuspid regurgitation is common and is estimated to occur in 65–85% of the population. In the Framingham Heart Study presence of any severity of tricuspid regurgitation, ranging from trace to above moderate was in 82% of men and in 85.7% of women. Mild tricuspid regurgitation tends to be common, benign, and in structurally normal tricuspid valve apparatus can be considered a normal variant. Moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation is usually associated with tricuspid valve leaflet abnormalities and/or possibly annular dilation and is usually pathologic which can lead to irreversible damage of cardiac muscle and worse outcomes due to chronic prolonged right ventricular volume overload.

<doc id="237419" wikidata="Q1060911" url="?curid=237419" title="Heart murmur">
<text>Heart murmurs are unique heart sounds produced when blood flows across a heart valve or blood vessel. This occurs when turbulent blood flow creates a sound loud enough to hear with a stethoscope. The sound differs from normal heart sounds by their characteristics. For example, heart murmurs may have a distinct pitch, duration and timing. The major way health care providers examine the heart on physical exam is heart auscultation; another clinical technique is palpation, which can detect by touch when such turbulence causes the vibrations called cardiac thrill. A murmur is a sign found during the cardiac exam. Murmurs are of various types and are important in the detection of cardiac and valvular pathologies (i.e. can be a sign of heart diseases or defects).

There are two types of murmur. A functional murmur is a benign heart murmur that is primarily due to physiologic conditions outside the heart. The other type of heart murmur is due to a structural defect in the heart itself. Defects may be due to narrowing of one or more valves (stenosis), backflow of blood, through a leaky valve (regurgitation), or the presence of abnormal passages through which blood flows in or near the heart.

Most murmurs are normal variants that can present at various ages which relate to changes of the body with age such as chest size, blood pressure, and pliability or rigidity of structures.

Heart murmurs are frequently categorized by timing. These include systolic heart murmurs, diastolic heart murmurs, or continuous murmurs. These differ in the part of the heartbeat they make sound, during systole, or diastole. Yet, continuous murmurs create sound throughout both parts of the heartbeat. Continuous murmurs are not placed into the categories of diastolic or systolic murmurs.

== Diagnostic approach and diagnosis ==

=== Classification ===

Murmurs have seven main characteristics. These include timing, shape, location, radiation, intensity, pitch and quality.
* &quot;Timing&quot; refers to whether the murmur is a systolic, diastolic, or continuous murmur.
* &quot;Shape&quot; refers to the intensity over time. Murmurs can be , or crescendo-decrescendo. Crescendo murmurs increase in intensity over time. Decrescendo murmurs decrease in intensity over time. Crescendo-decrescendo murmurs have both shapes over time. These have progressive increase in intensity, peak, and progressive decrease in intensity. Crescendo–decrescendo murmurs resemble a diamond or kite shape.
* &quot;Location&quot; refers to where the heart murmur is usually heard best. There are four places on the anterior chest wall to listen for heart murmurs. Each location roughly corresponds to a specific part of the heart. Health care providers listen to these areas with a stethoscope.

* Position for auscultation: The patient is most often lying on their back (supine) with the head of bed at slight upward angle. The head of the bed is usually at a 30 degree upward angle. Usually the health care provider is standing to the right of the person they are examining. Below are positional changes that one may use:
** Left lateral decubitus (lying on the left side). This will decrease the distance from wall of the chest to the apex of the heart. This will help to examine the point of maximal impulse. Also, this will help to hear extra heart sounds (S3 or S4).
** With the patient sitting upright.
** With the patient seated, leaning forward and holding breath after exhalation. This will decrease the distance of the chest wall to the left ventricular outflow tract. By doing so this will help find the presence of an aortic regurgitation murmur.
* &quot;Radiation&quot; refers to where the sound of the murmur travels. The rule of thumb is that the sound radiates in the direction of the blood flow.
* &quot;Intensity&quot; refers to the loudness of the murmur with grades according to the Levine scale, from 1 to 6:

* &quot;Pitch&quot; may be low, medium or high. This depends on whether auscultation is best with the bell or diaphragm of a stethoscope.
* &quot;Quality&quot; refers to unusual characteristics of a murmur. For example, blowing, harsh, rumbling or musical.

=== Interventions that change murmur sounds ===
* Inhalation leads to an increase in intrathoracic negative pressure. This increases the capacity of pulmonary circulation, thereby prolonging ejection time. This will affect the closure of the pulmonary valve. This finding is also called &quot;Carvallo&#x27;s maneuver.&quot; This maneuver in studies had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80% to 88% in detecting murmurs originating in the right heart. Positive Carvallo&#x27;s sign describes the increase in intensity of a tricuspid regurgitation murmur heard with inspiration.
* Abrupt standing
* Squatting, by increasing afterload and increasing preload. Squatting leads to an increase in systemic vascular resistance. An increase in systemic vascular resistance results in an increase in afterload. With HOCM, an increase in afterload will hold the obstruction in a more open configuration. This will decrease the loudness of the murmur with HOCM.
* Handgrip maneuver, by increasing afterload. Like squatting, this will decrease the loudness of the HOCM murmur.
* Valsalva maneuver. Valsalva maneuver has utility in detecting hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). According to one study, it has a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 96% in HOCM. Valsalva maneuver, as well as standing, decrease venous return to the heart. As a result, this decreases left ventricular filling. With HOCM, the outflow obstruction increases with a decrease in preload. This will increase the loudness of the murmur with HOCM.
* Post ectopic potentiation
* Inhaled amyl nitrite. This is a vasodilator that diminishes systolic murmurs in left-to-right shunts in ventricular septal defects. It also reveals right-to left shunts in the setting of pulmonic stenosis and a ventricular septal defect.
* Methoxamine
* Positioning of the patient. In the lateral decubitus position or lying on the left side. This will make murmurs in the mitral valve area more pronounced.

=== Anatomic sources ===
Systolic

Aortic valve stenosis is a crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur. It is best heard at the right upper sternal border (aortic area). It sometimes radiates to the carotid arteries. In mild aortic stenosis, the crescendo-decrescendo is early peaking. Whereas in severe aortic stenosis, the crescendo is late-peaking. In severe cases, obliteration of the S2 heart sound may occur.

Stenosis of Bicuspid aortic valve is like the aortic valve stenosis heart murmur. But, one may hear a systolic ejection click after S1 in calcified bicuspid aortic valves. Symptoms tend to present between 40 and 70 years of age.

Mitral regurgitation is a holosystolic murmur. One can best hear it at the apex location and it may radiate to the axilla or precordium. When associated with mitral valve prolapse, one may hear a systolic click. In this scenario, valsalva maneuver will decrease left ventricular preload. This will move the murmur onset closer to S1. Isometric handgrip will increase left ventricular afterload. This will increase murmur intensity. In acute severe mitral regurgitation, one may not hear a holosystolic murmur.

Pulmonary valve stenosis is a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur. One can hear it best at the left upper sternal border. It has association with a systolic ejection click that increases with inspiration. This finding results from an increased venous return to the right side of the heart. Pulmonary stenosis sometimes radiates to the left clavicle.

Tricuspid valve regurgitation is a holosystolic murmur. It presents at the left lower sternal border with radiation to the left upper sternal border. One may see prominent v and c waves in the JVP (jugular venous pressure). The murmur will increase with inspiration.

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (or hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) will be a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur. One can best hear it at the left lower sternal border. Valsalva maneuver will increase the intensity of the murmur. Going from squatting to standing will also increase the intensity of the murmur.

Atrial septal defect will present with a systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur. It is best heard at the left upper sternal border. This is the result of an increased volume going through the pulmonary valve. It has association with a fixed, split S2 and a right ventricular heave.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) will present as a holosystolic murmur. One can hear it at the left lower sternal border. It has association with a palpable thrill, and increases with isometric handgrip. A right to left shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome) may develop with uncorrected VSDs. This is due to worsening pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension will increase the murmur intensity and may present with cyanosis.

Flow murmur presents at the right upper sternal border. It may present in certain conditions, such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, fever, and pregnancy.

Diastolic

Aortic valve regurgitation will present as a diastolic decrescendo murmur. One can hear it at the left lower sternal border. One may also hear it at the right lower sternal border (when associated with a dilated aorta). Other possible exam findings are bounding carotid and peripheral pulses. These are also known as Corrigan&#x27;s pulse or Watson&#x27;s water hammer pulse. Another possible finding is a widened pulse pressure.

Mitral stenosis presents as a diastolic low-pitched decrescendo murmur. It is best heard at the cardiac apex in the left lateral decubitus position. Mitral stenosis may have an opening snap. Increasing severity will shorten the time between S2 (A2) and the opening snap. For example, in severe MS the opening snap will occur earlier after A2.

Tricuspid valve stenosis presents as a diastolic decrescendo murmur. One can hear it at the left lower sternal border. One may see signs of right heart failure on exam.

Pulmonary valve regurgitation presents as a diastolic decrescendo murmur. One may hear it at the left lower sternal border. A palpable S2 in the second left intercostal space correlates with pulmonary hypertension due to mitral stenosis.

The cooing dove murmur is a cardiac murmur with a musical quality (high pitched). Associated with aortic valve regurgitation (or mitral regurgitation before rupture of chordae). It is a diastolic murmur heard over the mid-precordium.

Continuous and Combined Systolic/Diastolic

Patent ductus arteriosus may present as a continuous murmur radiating to the back.

Severe coarctation of the aorta can present with a continuous murmur. One may hear the systolic component at the left infraclavicular region and the back. This is due to the stenosis. One may hear the diastolic component over the chest wall. This is due to blood flow through collateral vessels.

Acute severe aortic regurgitation may present with a three phase murmur. First, a midsystolic murmur followed by S2. Following this is a parasternal early diastolic and mid-diastolic murmur (Austin Flint murmur). The exact cause of an Austin Flint murmur is unknown. Hypothesis is that the mechanism of murmur is from the severe aortic regurgitation. In severe aortic regurgitation the jet vibrates the anterior mitral valve leaflet. This causes collision with the mitral inflow during diastole. As such, the mitral valve orifice narrows. This results in increased mitral inflow velocity. This leads to the jet impinging on the myocardial wall.

Ruptured aortic sinus (sinus of Valsalva) may present as a continuous murmur. This is an uncommon cause of continuous murmur One may hear it at the aortic area and along the left sternal border.

== Types and disease associations ==
;Continuous machinery murmur, at the left upper sternal border
:Classic for a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Signs of infants associated with serious cases of PDA are poor feeding, failure to thrive and respiratory distress. Other examination findings may include widened pulse pressures and bounding pulses. A machinery murmur is also known as a Gibson murmur.
;Systolic murmur loudest below the left scapula
:Classic for a coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is narrowing of the aorta. This can occur in Turner&#x27;s Syndrome, (gonadal dysgenesis). Turner&#x27;s Syndrome is an X-linked disorder with absence of one X-chromosome. Other exam findings of coarctation of the aorta include radio-femoral delay. This is when the femoral pulse is later than the radial pulse. The pulses in the lower extremity may be weaker than those of the upper extremity. Another exam finding is of varying blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities. This presents as higher blood pressure in the arms and lower blood pressure in the legs.
;Harsh holosystolic (pansystolic) murmur at the left lower sternal border
:Classic for a ventricular septal defect (VSD). This may lead to the development of the delayed-onset cyanotic heart disease known as Eisenmenger syndrome. Eisenmenger syndrome is a reversal of the left-to-right heart shunt. This is the result of hypertrophy of the right ventricle over time. This causes a right-to-left heart shunt. The VSD allows deoxygenated blood to flow from the right to left side of the heart. This blood bypasses the lungs. The lack of oxygenation in the pulmonary circulation results in cyanosis.
;Widely split fixed S2 and systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border
:Classic for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD). A PFO is lack of closure of the foramen ovale. At first, this produces a left-to-right heart shunt. This does not produce cyanosis, but causes pulmonary hypertension. Longstanding uncorrected atrial septal defects can also result in Eisenmenger syndrome. Eisenmenger syndrome can result in cyanosis.

==Management==
A medical provider (e.g. doctor) may order tests for further evaluation of a heart murmur. The echocardiogram is a common test used. This is also known as an &quot;echo&quot; or ultrasound of the heart. It shows the heart structures and blood flow through the heart. Further testing is usually done when symptoms that may be of concern are present.

The need for treatment depends on the diagnosis and severity. In some cases, the condition causing the heart murmur may prompt monitoring. Sometimes, heart murmurs disappear on their own. This happens when the cause of the heart murmur is no longer present. Monitoring will help determine how the condition changes. It may stay the same, worsen, or improve. In other cases, the condition causing the heart murmur may not prompt any further tests.

Treatment ranges from medication to surgeries.

<text>The Mill Creek is a stream in southwest Ohio. It flows southwest and south from its headwaters in Liberty Township of Butler County through central Hamilton County and the heart of Cincinnati into the Ohio River just west of downtown. The section of Interstate 75 through Cincinnati is known as the Mill Creek Expressway.

The Mill Creek Valley is a remnant of the Deep Stage Ohio River from the days of the Last Glacial Maximum. The stream, with its water power and valley, were important to the development of Cincinnati. Then, for a time, the steep hillsides that surround the creek limited expansion and gave impetus to the free growth of surrounding communities that were over that barrier. Finally, inclined planes solved the problem, before highways and automobiles eliminated it.

==Pollution==
Throughout Cincinnati&#x27;s history, Mill Creek has been the scene of heavy industry. At the turn of the 20th-century, it was seen as &quot;a great open city sewer&quot;. In 1997, it was described as &quot;the most endangered urban river in America.&quot;

== Discharge ==
A USGS stream gauge on the creek at Mitchell Avenue in Cincinnati recorded a mean annual discharge of during the four combined water years 1942-1943 and 1946–1947.

<doc id="237438" wikidata="Q455234" url="?curid=237438" title="Gloria Foster">
<text>Gloria Foster (November 15, 1933 – September 29, 2001) was an American actress. She had acclaimed roles in plays &quot;In White America&quot; and &quot;Having Our Say,&quot; winning three Obie Awards during her career. Foster played the Oracle in &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) and its first sequel, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2003). She played the role of the mother of Yusef Bell in the miniseries &quot;The Atlanta Child Murders&quot; which aired in 1985.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Foster was born on November 15, 1933, in Chicago, Illinois. As a young child, Foster was put into the custody of her maternal grandparents. Foster never knew who her father was and she moved to Janesville, Wisconsin after her mother was hospitalized for a mental illness. 

Foster attended the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she participated in plays, but did not focus on acting. Foster decided to be a professional actor when her godmother introduced her to the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Foster became one of the few African Americans at the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University). During her studying at the Goodman School she also, &quot;learned professional acting skills in the Court Theater at the University of Chicago&quot;. One of her most influential instructors was Bella Itkin, who cast Gloria in many classical roles.
===Career===
Foster began acting on Broadway in 1963. Her first role was Ruth in the show of &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;. Her first professional performance was &quot;In White America&quot;. Foster, &quot;play[s] a 13-year-old Arkansas girl who tries to enter her Little Rock school&quot;. She won an Obie Award or Off-Broadway Theater Award. People started to create parts for her, and rather than expecting her to audition for roles. Foster was known for her work with Joe Papp, and appeared in his productions of &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Orchard&quot;, Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage&quot; (adapted by Ntozake Shange), and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. Foster searched for roles in which she could perform to the best of her ability. She once said, &quot;Young people today, I think, are thinking in terms of stepping stones.…I don&#x27;t know that I ever thought that way. It sounds ridiculous, but I was always thinking in terms of a more difficult role&quot;.

===Highlights===
Moving from the New York stage, Gloria Foster started to do roles on the big screen. She was in many theatrical performances and also performed some roles on television. &quot;The Cool World&quot; (1964) – This was Gloria Foster&#x27;s first appearance in a full-length feature film. She played Mrs. Custis. It was on the set of this film that she starred next to her future husband, Clarence Williams III. &quot;Nothing But a Man&quot; (1964) – Gloria Foster plays a woman named Lee, who lives with the main character&#x27;s (Duff Anderson) father. She was also active in television, appearing in such programs as &quot;I Spy&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1987).

Her character in both &quot;Law and Order&quot; episodes, named Satima Tate, was based on the widow of Malcolm X, Betty Shabazz. The first episode, titled &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (1992), was based on Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination. Malcolm X was played by Hal Miller. The second episode, titled &quot;Entrapment&quot; (1997), focused on her character&#x27;s children&#x27;s acts of revenge against the people they believed were really responsible. She returned to theatre again in 1995, acting alongside Mary Alice (who was later to replace her in &quot;The Matrix&quot; films following her death), appearing as 103-year-old Sadie Delany, in &quot;Having Our Say&quot;, on Broadway at the Booth Theatre, for which she received rave reviews. She played the Oracle in &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2003); however, she died during filming and was thus unable to portray her role in the third film. As a result, Mary Alice replaced her in &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;.

===Personal life and death===
 Foster married the actor Clarence Williams III in 1967. They appeared on an episode of Williams&#x27;s television show &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; that ran from 1968 to 1973; Foster made two guest appearances. The two acted together in a 1964 film, &quot;The Cool World&quot;. Williams was the one to announce her death in 2001. While Foster did not have many close relatives, she stayed in contact with her Delta Sigma Theta sorority sister, Cicely Tyson. Tyson stated that, although they did not see each other often, their telephone conversations would often last for hours.

Gloria Foster died on September 29, 2001, at age 67. The cause of her death was diabetes. A memorial was held at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn on October 15, 2001. Martin Duberman, the author of &quot;In White America&quot;, told the audience about her 1963 performance that, &quot;she embodied it. At the end of the scene each night, there were tears streaming down her face, her body was trembling, but her dignity was intact ... Foster had to be covered with blankets in order to calm her shaking&quot;. 

Foster was a lifelong Democrat and a practicing Methodist.

<doc id="237439" wikidata="Q840592" url="?curid=237439" title="Flexor digitorum profundus muscle">
<text>The flexor digitorum profundus or flexor digitorum communis profundus is a muscle in the forearm of humans that flexes the fingers (also known as digits). It is considered an extrinsic hand muscle because it acts on the hand while its muscle belly is located in the forearm.

Together the flexor pollicis longus, pronator quadratus, and flexor digitorum profundus form the deep layer of ventral forearm muscles. The muscle is named .

== Structure ==
Flexor digitorum profundus originates in the upper 3/4 of the anterior and medial surfaces of the ulna, interosseous membrane and deep fascia of the forearm. The muscle fans out into four tendons (one to each of the second to fifth fingers) to the palmar base of the distal phalanx.

Along with the flexor digitorum superficialis, it has long tendons that run down the arm and through the carpal tunnel and attach to the palmar side of the phalanges of the fingers.

Flexor digitorum profundus lies deep to the superficialis, but it attaches more distally. Therefore, profundus&#x27;s tendons go through the tendons of superficialis, and end up attaching to the distal phalanx. For this reason profundus is also called the &quot;perforating muscle&quot;.

The lumbricals of the hand arise from the radial side of its tendons.

===Nerve supply===
Flexor digitorum profundus is a composite muscle innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve and ulnar nerves.
* The &quot;medial aspect&quot; of the muscle (which flexes the 4th and 5th digit) is supplied by the ulnar nerve (C8, T1).
* The &quot;lateral aspect&quot; (which flexes the 2nd and 3rd digit) is innervated by the median nerve, specifically the anterior interosseous branch (C8, T1).
It is one of two flexor muscles that is not exclusively supplied by the median nerve (the other is flexor carpi ulnaris). In the forearm, the median nerve travels distally between the flexor digitorum superficialis and the flexor digitorum profundus.

=== Variation ===
The tendon of the index finger often has a separate muscle belly.

== Function ==
Flexor digitorum profundus is a flexor of the wrist (midcarpal), metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. The lumbricals, intrinsic muscles of the hand, attach to the tendon of flexor digitorum profundus. Thus, the flexor muscle is used to aid the lumbrical muscles in their role as extensors of the interphalangeal joints. As the lumbrical muscles originate on the palmar side of the hand and attach on the dorsal aponeurosis, power is transferred from the flexor digitorum profundus muscle to fully extend the fingers as well as flex the metacarpophalangeal joints.

The tension generated by flexor digitorum profundus at the more distal joints is determined by wrist position. Flexion of the wrist causes muscle shortening at that point, reducing tension that can be generated more distally. Fingers cannot be fully flexed if the wrist is fully flexed.

== Other animals ==
In many primates, the FDP is fused with the flexor pollicis longus (FPL). In great apes the belly of the FDP has a separate tendon for the FDP. In lesser apes, both muscles have separate bellies in the forearm, but in Old World monkeys they separate in the carpal tunnel. The lack of differentiation in the FDP musculature in baboons makes it unlikely that this monkey can control individual fingers independently.

<text>Joseph Ira Dassin (; November 5, 1938 – August 20, 1980) was an American–French singer-songwriter. In his career spanning sixteen years (1964–1980), he enjoyed numerous successes in France and the French-speaking world, as well as singing in languages other than French. He had a career in Finland, Greece, and Germany. In total, he sold nearly 25 million records worldwide. He was the son of film director Jules Dassin.

==Early life==
Dassin was born in Brooklyn, New York to American film director Jules Dassin (1911–2008) and Béatrice Launer (1913–1994), a New York-born violinist, who after graduating from a Hebrew High School in the Bronx studied with the British violinist Harold Berkely at the Juilliard School of Music. Both of his parents were mostly of Ukrainian-Jewish extraction from Kamianets-Podilskyi, Sataniv and Buchach.

Dassin lived in New York City and Los Angeles until his father fell victim to the Hollywood blacklist in 1950, at which time his family moved to Europe. Between the ages of ten and fifteen Dassin changed schools eleven times. He studied at, among other places, the International School of Geneva and the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland, and finished his secondary education in Grenoble. Dassin moved back to the United States, where he attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan from 1957 to 1963, winning an undergraduate Hopwood Award for fiction in 1958 and earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1961 and a Master of Arts in 1963, both in Anthropology. He became a stepson of Greek actress, activist and Minister of Culture Melina Mercouri following his father&#x27;s second marriage in 1966.

==Career==
Moving to France, Dassin worked as a technician for his father and appeared as an actor in supporting roles, among others in three movies directed by his father, including &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964) in which he played the role of Josef. He met his future wife Maryse Massiéra in Paris in 1963.

On December 26, 1964, Dassin signed with CBS Records, making him the first French-language singer to be signed with an American record label.

By the early 1970s, Dassin&#x27;s songs were at the top of the charts in France, and he became immensely popular there. He recorded songs in German, Spanish, Italian, and Greek, as well as French and English. Amongst his most popular songs are &quot;Les Champs-Élysées&quot; (Originally &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;) (1969), &quot;Salut les amoureux&quot; (originally &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;) (1973), &quot;L&#x27;Été indien&quot; (1975), &quot;Et si tu n&#x27;existais pas&quot; (1975), and &quot;À toi&quot; (1976).

==Cinema==
Joe Dassin appeared in the following movies:

* 1957: Benos in &quot;He Who Must Die&quot;, by Jules Dassin 
* 1958: Nico in &quot;The Law&quot;, by Jules Dassin
* 1964: Joseph in &quot;Topkapi&quot;, by Jules Dassin
* 1965: A police inspector in &quot;Lady L&quot;, by Peter Ustinov
* 1965: Janos Adler in &quot;Nick Carter and Red Club&quot;, by Jean-Paul Savignac

==Personal life==
Dassin married Maryse Massiéra in Paris on January 18, 1966. Their son Joshua was born two and a half months early on September 12, 1973, and died five days later. Overcome by grief, Joe became deeply depressed. Despite all their efforts, their marriage did not survive. In 1977, one year after their move to their newly built home in Feucherolles, just outside Paris, they divorced.

On January 14, 1978, Dassin married Christine Delvaux in Cotignac. Their first son, Jonathan, was born on 14 September 1978; and their second son, Julien, arrived on March 22, 1980. Christine died in December 1995.

==Death==
Dassin died from a heart attack during a vacation to Tahiti on August 20, 1980, aged 41. He was eating lunch with family and friends at the restaurant &quot;Chez Michel et Éliane&quot; in Papeete when he suddenly slumped in his chair, unconscious. A doctor who was also eating at the restaurant performed CPR on him, but Dassin died at the restaurant. The only ambulance in Papeete was unavailable at the time and took 40 minutes to arrive. His body was returned to the United States and is interred in the Beth Olam section of Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.
==Tributes==
In 2020, many established artists paid tribute to Joe Dassin songs in a covers / tribute album &quot;À toi, Joe Dassin&quot;. The album peaked at No. 44 in the French SNEP Albums chart. It also charted in Belgium peaking at No. 26 in the country&#x27;s Ultratop albums francophone chart and also peaking at No. 4 in the &quot;Swiss Hitparade&quot; (Albums Chart).

Artists interpreting Joe Dassin songs on the album included Ycare, Axelle Red, Les Frangines, Trois Cafés Gourmands, Patrick Fiori, Kids United Nouvelle Génération, Madame Monsieur, and Camélia Jordana.

<doc id="237447" wikidata="Q6858297" url="?curid=237447" title="Mill Creek Township, Hamilton County, Ohio">
<text>Millcreek Township (or Mill Creek Township) is a survey township in south-central Hamilton County, Ohio, that also existed as a civil township from 1810 until 1943. Once the most important township in the county, it was largely absorbed by Cincinnati and its suburbs, nominally remaining as a paper township from 1943 until 1953. It was abolished when the rest of its unincorporated territory, consisting of Wesleyan Cemetery, became part of Cincinnati. As the original survey township covers a large portion of present-day Cincinnati, references to it are frequently encountered by genealogists.

== Name ==
Millcreek Township is named after Mill Creek, which runs through it. Statewide, other Millcreek Townships are located in Coshocton, Union, and Williams counties.

== History ==
In 1809, residents of Cincinnati Township and Springfield Township successfully petitioned the Hamilton County Board of County Commissioners to form a new township corresponding to fractional range two, township three of the Symmes Purchase, a total of . Township trustees were first elected in February 1810.

On February 28, 1870, Cincinnati annexed Lick Run and Camp Washington. By 1881, Cincinnati had annexed the village of Cumminsville (now Northside) within the township limits. By 1904, Cincinnati had also annexed the villages of Winton Place (now Spring Grove Village) and Bond Hill. However, there was confusion because no action had been taken to also transfer them from Millcreek Township to Cincinnati Township, which was by then a paper township whose sole purpose was to exclude land from any real township. By 1912, annexations by Cincinnati left Elmwood Place and Wesleyan Cemetery as the only unincorporated portions of the township, prompting an investigation into whether the township should be abolished.

Norwood withdrew from the township around 1938 by forming its own paper township. In 1939 and 1941, Cincinnati attempted to annex the , unincorporated enclave occupied by the historic Wesleyan Cemetery. However, burial lot owners and relatives of people buried at the cemetery successfully defeated the annexation over fears that the city would run a street through the cemetery. In 1943, St. Bernard and Elmwood Place (now a village) withdrew from the township as well, reducing it to only the cemetery and $517.35 in assets.

Attorney General Thomas J. Herbert issued an opinion that the cemetery enclave should be considered part of Cincinnati and the township should be abolished. However, the matter was not settled: state law required the freeholders within a territory to vote on annexation, but no freeholder remained in the township to vote in favor. The township&#x27;s one resident of voting age, the cemetery&#x27;s sexton, did not own the cemetery; conversely, the Wesleyan Cemetery Association&#x27;s board members did not reside at the cemetery. Meanwhile, the sexton could not simultaneously serve in all three trustee positions that state law requires of a functioning township government. The county also sought to avoid setting up a special polling place for the sexton, which would have required the appointment of six election officers.

In 1950, Cincinnati sued the Wesleyan Cemetery Association in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court to determine whether the city has jurisdiction over the cemetery. Despite being in the middle of an urban area, the cemetery had no provisions for police or fire protection. In 1953, a bill introduced by State Representative Robert F. Reckman to consider remnants of townships with no resident freeholders to be part of municipalities as if they had been annexed was approved by the Governor. On October 20, 1953, the Clerk of Council of the City of Cincinnati issued a certificate and plat stating that that part of Wesleyan Cemetery that was a remnant of Mill Creek Township was then part of the City of Cincinnati. Despite this action by the City, news articles refer to the cemetery as constituting nonfunctioning Millcreek Township as late as 1961.

During the 1990s and 2000s, the cemetery passed from one caretaker to another amid controversy about mismanagement. The cemetery grew unkempt and attracted prostitutes and drug dealers. Attorney General Jim Petro stepped in, obtaining a ruling in Common Pleas Court that removed the caretaker and declared Wesleyan a public cemetery. Cincinnati unsuccessfully fought in court to avoid taking over management of the cemetery.

== Geography ==
The original territory of Millcreek Township was bounded by Cincinnati Township and Storrs Township to the south, Green Township to the west, Springfield Township to the north, and Columbia Township and Spencer Township to the east.

The following villages were at some point located in Millcreek Township:

* Avondale (annexed by Cincinnati)
* Bond Hill (annexed by Cincinnati)
* Carthage (partially in the township; annexed by Cincinnati)
* Clifton (annexed by Cincinnati)
* College Hill (annexed by Cincinnati)
* Cumminsville (annexed by Cincinnati)
* Elmwood Place (incorporated and withdrew)
* Mount Airy (partially in the township; annexed by Cincinnati)
* Norwood (incorporated and withdrew)
* St. Bernard (incorporated and withdrew)
* Winton Place (annexed by Cincinnati)
* Woodburn (annexed by Cincinnati)

<text>Beatriz &quot;Gigi&quot; Fernández (born February 22, 1964) is a Puerto Rican-American former professional tennis player.
Fernández won 17 major doubles titles and two Olympic gold medals representing the United States, and reached the world No. 1 ranking in doubles. She reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 17 in 1991. Since retiring from the professional tour in 1997 at the age of 33, Fernández has been a tennis coach and entrepreneur. She now shares her knowledge of doubles with tennis enthusiasts throughout the US by conducting Master Doubles with Gigi Clinics and Doubles Boot Camps. Fernández is the first Puerto Rican to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Fernández was recognized primarily as a doubles specialist during her professional career. She won a career doubles Grand Slam with 17 Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles title – six French Open, five US Open, four Wimbledon, and two Australian Open winning at least one Grand Slam title every year from 1988 to 1997, except 1989, and for three straight years winning three of the four Grand Slam doubles titles in the same year (1992–1994). She won 14 of her 17 Grand Slam titles partnering Natasha Zvereva; their partnership is the second most successful doubles pair in the Open era after Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver.

In mixed doubles, Fernández was the runner-up in three of the four Grand Slam mixed doubles events in 1995 (Australian Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) partnering Cyril Suk. Fernández captured 68 career titles in women&#x27;s doubles and reached the world No. 1 doubles ranking in 1991 and attained the No. 1 ranking again in 1993, 1994 and 1995. She won a total of 69 doubles titles during her career.

Fernández represented the United States at the Olympic Games in 1992 (Barcelona) and 1996 (Atlanta). She teamed with Mary Joe Fernández (no relation) to win the women&#x27;s doubles gold medal on both occasions. The first gold medal was won against the home team of Conchita Martínez and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario with the king and queen of Spain in the audience. The two medals are on Fernández&#x27;s desk, and a license plate on her car states &quot;DBL GLD&quot;.

Fernández represented Puerto Rico when San Juan played host to the Pan Am Games in 1979. Just 15, Fernández won a bronze medal. In 1982 at the Central American-Caribbean Games in Cuba, she teamed with Marilda Julia to win doubles gold and won a silver medal in the singles as well. She represented Puerto Rico at the 1984 Olympics.

Fernández was also on the United States team that won the Federation Cup in 1990.

In singles, Fernández reached as high as world No. 17. She also won two top-level titles and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1994 (ranked 99 becoming the lowest-ranked Grand Slam singles semifinalist at Wimbledon) and the quarterfinals at the US Open in 1991 and 1994.

Fernández retired from the professional tour in 1997, and in 1999, she was named Puerto Rico&#x27;s &quot;Female Athlete of the Century&quot;.

On July 12, 2010, Fernández was inducted in the International Tennis Hall of Fame with Zvereva.

==Personal life==
Her parents are Tuto Fernández, a well-known doctor in Puerto Rico, and Beatriz Fernández. Her cousin José Ferrer was a famous Puerto Rican actor and director. Fernández started playing tennis when she was seven. She studied at the prestigious Academia San José in Guaynabo. When she turned professional in 1983, she became Puerto Rico&#x27;s first female professional athlete. Before turning professional, she played tennis for one season at Clemson University in 1982–83, where she was singles and doubles All-American and reached the National Collegiate Athletics Association singles final.

Since retiring from the tour, Fernández has worked as a tennis coach. She has coached players including the former world No. 1 doubles player Rennae Stubbs, Lisa Raymond, and Samantha Stosur. She coached Sam Stosur to her first Grand Slam title at the 2005 US Open with Lisa Raymond. She also coached for the Puerto Rican national team and the University of South Florida.

She earned a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from the University of South Florida in 2003 and later graduated from Rollins College&#x27;s Crummer School of Business where she earned a Master of Business Administration. She is the mother of twins, Karson Xavier and Madison Jane, and the partner of retired professional golfer and former LPGA and WWE executive Jane Geddes.

In 2010, Fernández started a company named Baby Goes Pro. She presently resides in Tampa, Florida and was the Director of Adult Tennis at Chelsea Piers Connecticut, as well as Summer Director at The Long Ridge Tennis Club.

In a 2021 interview, Fernández stated she receives a lot of negative comments from some Puerto Ricans via her social media and that it saddens her.

<doc id="237456" wikidata="Q7293479" url="?curid=237456" title="Ransom Everglades School">
<text>Ransom Everglades School is an independent, non-profit, co-educational, college-preparatory day school serving grades six to twelve in Coconut Grove in Miami, Florida, United States. It formed with the merger in 1974 of the Everglades School for Girls and the Ransom School for Boys. It&#x27;s described as a college preparatory school and 100% of Ransom Everglades&#x27; students attend a four-year institution after graduation.

Admission to the school is selective and tuition costs $49,250 per year (2023–24). Tuition includes lunch and most fees except for books. A significant, need-based financial aid program is available. Graduating classes each year range between 150 and 160 students. All students matriculate to four year universities; typically, more than 85% of graduating students continue on to out-of-state colleges and universities.

Ransom Everglades is fully accredited by the Southern Association of Independent Schools and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (AdvancED). Membership is held in the Southern and National Associations for College Admission Counseling, the National Association of Independent Schools, the College Entrance Examination Board, the Enrollment Management Association, the Council for Spiritual and Ethical Education, the Global Online Academy, the Mastery Transcript Consortium, and the Independent Curriculum Group, among other educational organizations. The school appeared as the #1 Private High School in Florida in the 2018 Niche rankings.

== History ==
Paul C. Ransom, an educator and New York lawyer, opened Pine Knot Camp in 1896 as a school for boys in Coconut Grove. In 1902 he combined that with a campus in the Adirondacks of New York to create the Adirondack-Florida School, the first migratory boarding school. Ransom emphasized a curriculum based on experiential learning. Students attended classes on the Florida campus in the winter and on the New York campus in fall and spring. The school suspended operations during World War II. After the war the school reopened in 1947. In 1949 the Adirondack campus was shut down and the school continued in Coconut Grove as the Ransom School for Boys. Ransom School changed from a boarding to a day school in 1972. Its counterpart, the Everglades School for Girls, began in 1955 founded by Marie B. Swenson. The schools merged and took its current name in 1974.

The school continues to be influenced and guided by the values of its founders. Ransom&#x27;s letter to prospective students, stating an interest only in boys who &quot;believe that they are in the world not so much for what they can get out of it as for what they can put into it&quot; is read to the students at the beginning of the year by the Head of School.

Meanwhile, inspired by the philosophy of Marie B. Swenson, who opened the Everglades School for Girls to all students, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity, the school today values a diverse community of learners. According to the school profile, about 20% speak a language other than English at home. A financial aid program exists to meet the need of students once they are admitted.

Ransom Everglades has longstanding community partnerships with Breakthrough Miami, St. Alban&#x27;s Child Enrichment Center, Booker T. Washington High School, ARC of South Florida, MUVE and the Reclamation Project, and many other community organizations. After a devastating earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010, students at Ransom Everglades raised almost $30,000 which they donated to relief efforts in that country.

== Campuses ==
The school occupies two campuses. The &quot;Upper School&quot; (Ransom Campus) serves grades nine through twelve and is located on Main Highway on the shore of Biscayne Bay, the site of the original Pine Knot Camp. This makes it the oldest South Florida school still in its original location. The original site of the Everglades School for Girls is now the &quot;Middle School&quot; campus (Everglades Campus), serving grades six through eight and located on South Bayshore Drive, about one and a half miles from the Upper School. It is not on the water but is in a residential neighborhood and a mile away from the restaurants and shops of Coconut Grove.

Three early twentieth century buildings still stand on the Ransom campus. The &quot;pagoda&quot; was built in 1902. It was once the whole school—the place where the original students both learned and lived. Now, the building serves as the Head of School&#x27;s office, an event and study space, and faculty offices. It&#x27;s often featured in historic pictures of South Miami, and in 1973 was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Like the Pagoda, the &quot;Ransom Cottage&quot; is constructed from local materials, largely Dade County pine, and is also on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1906, the cottage has been used as the infirmary, the Headmaster&#x27;s residence, and the band room. Restored in 1998, now the cottage is a conference room and meeting space. In June 2016, Ransom Everglades acquired the La Brisa property adjacent to the Ransom Campus. The 6.9 acre campus includes a restored 1920s home that sits 23 feet above sea level. According to Penny Townsend, the then-Head of School, the acquisition of the campus would allow the school to &quot;improve [its] facilities, add vital greenspace and continue [its] long tradition of respecting, protecting and learning from the treasures of Old Florida and Miami’s precious coastal ecosystems.”

Both campuses are featured in the 1998 movie &quot;Wild Things&quot;.

== Academics ==
The school offers more than 20 Advanced Placement courses each year, and typically 90% or more of the 900+ AP exams taken each year result in a score of 3 or better. Recently, the school replaced some of its AP classes with &quot;Advanced classes&quot; which are at a higher level and allow students to take the AP exam at the end of the academic year. In the Fall of 2018, 16 Ransom Everglades seniors were named National Merit Semi-Finalists.

== Athletics ==
The school has a comprehensive athletic program with over 70 teams among 18 interscholastic sports. Ransom Everglades has fielded state championship teams in recent years in water polo (2014, 2015, 2016, 2019), soccer (2015, 2016), tennis (2014, 2018), and volleyball (2013).

<text>The thenar eminence is the mound formed at the base of the thumb on the palm of the hand by the intrinsic group of muscles of the thumb. The skin overlying this region is the area stimulated when trying to elicit a palmomental reflex. The word thenar comes .

==Structure==
The following three muscles are considered part of the thenar eminence:
* Abductor pollicis brevis abducts the thumb. This muscle is the most superficial of the thenar group.
* Flexor pollicis brevis, which lies next to the abductor, will flex the thumb, curling it up in the palm. (The flexor pollicis longus, which is inserted into the distal phalanx of the thumb, is not considered part of the thenar eminence.)
* Opponens pollicis lies deep to abductor pollicis brevis. As its name suggests it opposes the thumb, bringing it against the fingers. This is a very important movement, as most of human hand dexterity comes from this action.

Another muscle that controls movement of the thumb is adductor pollicis. It lies deeper and more distal to flexor pollicis brevis. Despite the name, adductor pollicis is chiefly responsible for rotation and opposition. This muscle is not in the thenar group of muscles, and is supplied by the ulnar nerve instead.

===Nerve supply===
The opponens pollicis and abductor pollicis brevis are normally innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve.

The flexor pollicis brevis has two heads: a superficial and a deep head. The superficial head is usually innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve. The deep part is often innervated by the deep branch of ulnar nerve (C8 and T1 roots).

There are normal variations. In a Cannieu-Riche anastomosis, fibers from the deep branch of ulnar nerve innervate the opponens pollicis and/or abductor pollicis brevis. Regardless of their final innervation, the nerves that reach the thenar muscles arise from the C8 and T1 roots, pass through the lower trunk of the brachial plexus, and then through the medial cord of the plexus.

The adductor pollicis is typically innervated by the ulnar nerve.

The ulnar nerve is exclusively responsible for the innervations of the hypothenar eminence. Both nerves contribute to the innervations of the midpalmar group.

The innervation of these muscles by the median nerve is unusual, as most of the intrinsic muscles on the palm of the hand are supplied by the ulnar nerve. The lateral two lumbrical muscles are the other exception.

<doc id="237460" wikidata="Q2646525" url="?curid=237460" title="Conventional wisdom">
<text>The conventional wisdom or received opinion is the body of ideas or explanations generally accepted by the public and/or by experts in a field. In religion, this is known as orthodoxy.

==Etymology==
The term is often credited to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who used it in his 1958 book &quot;The Affluent Society&quot;:

However, the term dates back to at least 1838. &quot;Conventional wisdom&quot; was used in a number of other works before Galbraith, occasionally in a benign
or neutral
sense, but more often pejoratively.
However, previous authors used it as a synonym for &quot;commonplace knowledge&quot;. Galbraith specifically prepended &quot;The&quot; to the phrase to emphasize its uniqueness, and sharpened its meaning to narrow it to those commonplace beliefs that are also acceptable and comfortable to society, thus enhancing their ability to resist facts that might diminish them. He repeatedly referred to it throughout the text of &quot;The Affluent Society&quot;, invoking it to explain the high degree of resistance in academic economics to new ideas. For these reasons, he is usually credited with the invention and popularization of the phrase in modern usage.

==Accuracy==

Conventional wisdom is not necessarily true. It is often seen as a hindrance to the acceptance of new information, and to the introduction of new theories and explanations, an obstacle that must be overcome by legitimate revisionism. That is, conventional wisdom has a property analogous to inertia that opposes the introduction of contrary belief, sometimes to the point of absurd denial of the new information or interpretation by persons strongly holding an outdated but conventional view. Since conventional wisdom is convenient, appealing, and deeply assumed by the public, this inertia can last even after many experts and/or opinion leaders have shifted to a new convention.

Conventional wisdom may be political, being closely related to the phenomenon of talking points. The term is used pejoratively to suggest that consistently repeated statements become conventional wisdom whether they are true or not.

More generally, it refers to accepted truth that almost no one seems to dispute, and so it is used as a gauge (or wellspring) of normative behavior or belief, even within a professional context. For example, the conventional wisdom in 1950, even among most doctors, was that smoking tobacco is not particularly harmful to one&#x27;s health. The conventional wisdom today is that it is. More narrowly, the conventional wisdom in science and engineering once was that a man would suffer lethal injuries if he experienced more than eighteen g-forces in an aerospace vehicle, but it is so no longer. (John Stapp repeatedly withstood far more in his research, peaking above 46 Gs in 1954.)

==Integration with scientific evidence==
Evidence-based medicine is a deliberate effort to acknowledge expert opinion (conventional wisdom) and how it coexists with scientific data. Evidence-based medicine acknowledges that expert opinion is &quot;evidence&quot; and plays a role to fill the &quot;gap between the kind of knowledge generated by clinical research studies and the kind of knowledge necessary to make the best decision for individual patients.&quot;

<text>A paymaster is someone appointed by a group of buyers, sellers, investors or lenders to receive, hold, and dispense funds, commissions, fees, salaries (remuneration) or other trade, loan, or sales proceeds within the private sector or public sector. Specific titles within the British government are Paymaster of the Forces, Paymaster General and Paymaster of Pensions.

==Purpose==
The primary purpose of a paymaster is to receive fees in escrow by buyers in a large transaction, and disburse to the sellers and brokers on the transaction.

A paymaster is usually, but not required to be, a lawyer (also known as a &#x27;lawyer paymaster&#x27;). When dealing with commission payments on contracts dealing with large amounts of money (such as oil, gas, steel, iron, gold, MTNs, VGs, t-strips, and other instruments), most banks in the United States are very wary of handling such large amounts of money. In addition, most buyers and sellers of such transactions want to place the money with a neutral third party for disbursement. In most cases, the buyer and the seller involved in the transaction require a paymaster be named to handle all incoming and outgoing funds.

A paymaster is a neutral third party and has no knowledge of any particulars of the transaction. They handle the incoming commissions, and then disburses the funds accordingly. In return for their services the paymaster charges a small fee, which is paid directly to them out of the commission proceeds prior to disbursement.

==Requirements for position==
In the United States, there is no licensing requirement to be a paymaster. However, a paymaster often is a licensed lawyer, due to the security and safety issue that lawyers in the United States are required to hold any funds that do not belong directly to them in an &quot;Attorney&#x27;s Trust Account&quot; (also known as an IOLTA account), which is monitored by the state bar, in the state in which the lawyer practices.

==United States military==
In the American Civil War era, a paymaster was generally a commissioned person in the army who held the relative rank of captain or major, depending on cumulative time in service of the person and the period in which they served (the regulations changed over time). The navy was similar, with the equivalent rank as lieutenant, lieutenant commander or commander.

<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Paymaster General or HM Paymaster General is a ministerial position in the Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom. The position is currently held by Nick Thomas-Symonds of the Labour Party.

==History==

The post was created in 1836 by the merger of the positions of the offices of the Paymaster of the Forces (1661–1836), the Treasurer of the Navy (1546–1835), the Paymaster and Treasurer of Chelsea Hospital (responsible for Army pensions) (1681–1835) and the Treasurer of the Ordnance (1670–1835).

Initially, the Paymaster General only had responsibilities in relation to the armed services but in 1848 two more offices were merged into that of Paymaster General: the Paymaster of Exchequer Bills (1723–1848) and the Paymaster of the Civil Service (1834–1848), the latter followed by its Irish counterpart in 1861. They thus became &#x27;the principal paying agent of the government and the banker for all government departments except the revenue departments and the National Debt Office&#x27;.

From 1848 to 1868, the post was held concurrently with that of Vice-President of the Board of Trade.

The longest-serving holder of the post was Dawn Primarolo, whose portfolio covered HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue (which during her tenure became merged as HM Revenue and Customs) and who served from 1999 to 2007.

==Role==
Today, the Paymaster General is usually a minister without portfolio available for any duties which the government of the day may designate. The post may be combined with another office, or may be left unfilled.

Though the Paymaster General was titular head of the Paymaster General&#x27;s Office, their executive functions were delegated to the Assistant Paymaster General, a permanent civil servant who (though acting in the name of the Paymaster General) was answerable to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

===Office of HM Paymaster General===
The Paymaster General was formerly in nominal charge (and at one time in actual charge) of the Office of HM Paymaster General (OPG), which held accounts at the Bank of England on behalf of government departments and selected other public bodies. Funds which were made available from the Consolidated Fund were then channelled into OPG accounts, from where they were used by the relevant body. OPG operated a full range of accounts and banking transaction services, including cheque and credit, BACS and CHAPS services for its customers via an electronic banking system. Integration of OPG accounts held with commercial banks was provided by the private company Xafinity Paymaster which is now part of the Equiniti group.

However, in 2008, the government announced that the Office of the Paymaster General would be incorporated into a new body, the Government Banking Service, which also provides banking operations for HM Revenue &amp; Customs and National Savings and Investments. Following the Bank of England&#x27;s decision to withdraw from providing retail banking services, retail banking and payment services for the GBS are provided by a range of financial institutions including Barclays, Citibank, NatWest, and Worldpay, although the Bank of England still plays a role in managing the government&#x27;s higher level accounts.

<doc id="237463" wikidata="Q310438" url="?curid=237463" title="Phaseolus">
<text>Phaseolus (bean, wild bean) is a genus of herbaceous to woody annual and perennial vines in the family Fabaceae containing about 70 plant species, all native to the Americas, primarily Mesoamerica.

It is one of the most economically important legume genera. Five of the species have been domesticated since pre-Columbian times for their beans: &quot;P. acutifolius&quot; (tepary bean), &quot;P. coccineus&quot; (runner bean), &quot;P. dumosus&quot; (year bean), &quot;P. lunatus&quot; (lima bean), and &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; (common bean). Most prominent among these is the common bean, &quot;P. vulgaris&quot;, which today is cultivated worldwide in tropical, semitropical, and temperate climates.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Phaseolus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including common swift, garden dart, ghost moth &quot;Hypercompe albicornis&quot;, &quot;H. icasia&quot; and the nutmeg.

==Etymology==

The generic name &quot;Phaseolus&quot; was introduced by Linnaeus in 1753, from the Latin &quot;phaseolus&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;phasēlus&quot;, in turn borrowed from Greek φάσηλος / &quot;phasēlos&quot; of unknown origin. The Ancient Greeks probably referred to any bean in a pod as &quot;phasēlos&quot;, which at the time, in Europe, were only of Asian origin. Later, when the common bean was introduced into Europe via Columbian exchange in the 16th Century, the meaning of the term extended to the New World beans.

== Taxonomy ==
Previous classifications placed a number of other well-known legume species in this genus, but they were subsequently reassigned to the genus &quot;Vigna&quot;, sometimes necessitating a change of species name. For example, older literature refers to the mung bean as &quot;Phaseolus aureus&quot;, whereas more modern sources classify it as &quot;Vigna radiata&quot;. Similarly, the snail bean &quot;Vigna caracalla&quot; was discovered in 1753 and in 1970 moved from &quot;Phaseolus&quot; to &quot;Vigna&quot;. The modern understanding of &quot;Phaseolus&quot; indicates a genus endemic only to the New World.

==Species==

Species have been organized into eight groups based on phylogenetic clades:

*&quot;Phaseolus plagiocylix&quot;
*&quot;Phaseolus polymorphus&quot;
*&quot;Phaseolus sonorensis&quot;
*&quot;Phaseolus vulcanicus&quot;










==Allergenicity==
The &quot;Phaseolus&quot; plant has an OPALS plant allergy scale rating of 4 out of 10, indicating moderate potential to cause allergic reactions, exacerbated by over-use of the same plant throughout a garden. Leaves can cause skin rash and old plants often carry rust.

<doc id="237467" wikidata="Q364413" url="?curid=237467" title="Nicola Pisano">
<text>Nicola Pisano (also called &quot;Niccolò Pisano&quot;, &quot;Nicola de Apulia&quot; or &quot;Nicola Pisanus&quot;; /1225 – ) was an Italian sculptor whose work is noted for its classical Roman sculptural style. Pisano is sometimes considered to be the founder of modern sculpture.

== Early life ==
His birth date or origins are uncertain. He was born in Apulia, as the son of &quot;Petrus de Apulia&quot;, as stated in the archives of the Cathedral of Siena. Nicola Pisano was probably trained in the local workshops of the emperor Frederick II, and he attended his coronation. Here he was trained to give to the traditional representations more movement and emotions, intertwining Classical and Christian traditions. His only remaining works from this period are two griffon heads with a soft chiaroscuro effect.

Around 1245 he moved to Tuscany to work at the Prato Castle. The lions on the portal of this castle are probably by his hand. &quot;The head of a young girl&quot; (now displayed in the Museo del Palazzo Venezia in Rome), cut in the hardstone of Elba, is also ascribed to Nicola Pisano in the same period.

He moved to Lucca, working at façade of the Cathedral of Saint Martin, resulting in the relief &quot;Deposition from the Cross&quot; (on the north tympanum) and the lintel reliefs &quot;Nativity&quot; and &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;.
== Pulpit of the Pisa baptistery ==

He moved to Pisa between 1245 and 1250, where his son Giovanni Pisano was born. Around 1255 he received a commission for the pulpit in the Pisa Baptistry. He finished this work in 1260 and signed it with &quot;Nicola Pisanus&quot;. He was aided by several assistants, among which were Arnolfo di Cambio and Lapo di Ricevuto.

In this pulpit, considered one of his masterworks, he succeeded in making a synthesis of the French Gothic style with the Classical style of ancient Rome, as he had probably learned in South Italy and must have seen on the sarcophagi of the Camposanto in Pisa, such as the &quot;Phaedra&quot; sarcophagus or &quot;Meleager hunting the Calydonian Boar&quot; on a sarcophagus brought as booty to Pisa by its navy. Vasari relates that Nicola Pisano constantly studied these Roman remains and the Roman sculptures from Augustan times seem to have marked a deep impression on him. 

The pulpit rests on seven columns. A raised central column is supported by sculptures of animals and telamons. It is surrounded by six external columns of different heights, three of which rest on realistically carved lions, while the other three rest on octagonal bases. The columns came from remains at Ostia. The Corinthian capitals support trefoil Gothic arches, decorated in the spandrels with paired &quot;Prophets&quot; and, under the reliefs of the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; and the &quot;Last Judgement&quot;, with &quot;Evangelists&quot;. The arches are separated by sculptures of &quot;St. John the Baptist&quot;, &quot;St. Michael&quot; and four &quot;Virtues&quot;, Charity, Fortitude, Temperance and Prudence. The nude sculpture of Fortitude obviously derives from a Roman Hercules.

The hexagonal pulpit itself consists of five reliefs in white Carrara marble from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;: the first relief combines three scenes, the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, the &quot;Nativity&quot; and the &quot;Annunciation to the Shepherds&quot;, while the following show single scenes: the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, the &quot;Presentation in the Temple&quot;, the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; and the &quot;Last Judgment&quot;. The backgrounds of these scenes were originally painted and enamelled, while the eyes of the figures were coloured. This contributed further to a realistic impression of these religious topics. All these reliefs, except the last two, reflect Pisano&#x27;s knowledge of the style on Roman sarcophagi. The figures wear tunics in a Roman fashion. The reclining Virgin of the &quot;Nativity&quot; derives from Etruscan tomb sculpture. She also wears a pallium over her head in the same manner as a Roman matron. In the &quot;Presentation&quot; panel the Madonna reminds us of the regal bearing of goddesses in late Roman sculpture, while the expressive face of St. Anne shows the ravages of age.

The scene &quot;The Last Judgement&quot; was probably based on a Byzantine ivory and &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; was sculpted with the same elegance as contemporary French Gothic art.

Another inspiration for this pulpit he may have found also in the triumphal arches he could have seen in Rome when travelling to Ostia. The form of this pulpit diverges completely from contemporary art. The sculptures are represented in the same manner as those of the Arch of Constantine in Rome, with the figures standing atop columns. Furthermore, the same arch has an attic storey with sculpted scenes, as does the pulpit.Ref?
Between 1260 and 1264 he finished the work of the architect Diotisalvi on the dome of the baptistery.Ref? He increased its height with a system of two domes: a small truncated cone on top of the hemispherical dome. The two rows of traceried gables were later decorated by his son Giovanni Pisano between 1277 and 1284.

== Shrine of Saint Dominic (Bologna) ==
During 1264 he was asked to work on the Shrine of Saint Dominic in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. He was certainly responsible for the design, but his input was probably minimal. In 1265 he was already at work on the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral. The front side was done in his workshop, partially by Nicola Pisano himself but mostly by his assistant Lapo di Ricevuto. It would almost take 500 years to finish this shrine through the work of famous sculptors: Arnolfo di Cambio, fra Guglielmo Agnelli, Niccolò dell&#x27;Arca, the young Michelangelo, Girolamo Coltellini and Giovanni Batista Boudard. The expressive face of saint Dominic, so different from the blander faces in the front panel &quot;Saint Dominic resurrects Napoleone Orsini&quot;, is attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio.

== Siena Cathedral Pulpit ==

In September 1265 he was given his next major assignment: a marble pulpit for Siena Cathedral. This pulpit, made of Carrara marble, was sculpted between the end of 1265 and November 1268 with the extensive participation of his son Giovanni Pisano and his assistants Arnolfo di Cambio, Lapo di Ricevuto and several other artists.

This is the earliest remaining work in the cathedral. Nicola Pisano was given this commission due to his fame by the Pisa pulpit. This pulpit, resembling the Pisa pulpit but larger, is even more ambitious and is considered his masterpiece. The whole message of the pulpit is concerned with the doctrine of Salvation and the Last Judgment.

== Pistoia and Perugia ==
In July 1273 Nicola Pisano was commissioned by the Operai di San Jacopo of Pistoia to make the altar of San Jacopo in the Pistoia Cathedral. He worked on it together with his son Giovanni. The chapel of San Jacopo was demolished in 1786. The Holy Water stoup with its three female figures was probably sculpted at the same time. Giovanni Pisano would later make his first pulpit in the same cathedral.
His last major commission was the relief panels on the Fontana Maggiore (&quot;Great Fountain&quot;) at Perugia (1277–1278). Fra Bevignate and Boninsegna designed the fountain with three superposed basins. The fountain certainly shows the delicate hand of Nicolò Pisano, but most sculpting was executed by his son Giovanni Pisano and his assistants. By its richness in details and by its iconography, this last work shows a rapprochement to French Gothic art.

== Conclusion ==
Although influenced by the works of Classical Antiquity, Nicola was not simply an imitator. His figures are original creations that came into being through a thorough study and understanding of the antique prototypes and the reinstating of antique representations. His works are the most important precursors of Italian Renaissance sculpture. Surveys of Italian Renaissance art often begin with the year 1260, the year that Nicola Pisano dated his pulpit in the Pisa baptistery.

On the other hand, as the pulpit of the Siena Cathedral shows, Nicola Pisano was still attached to contemporary Gothic art. This characteristic may arise because this pulpit was finished by his son Giovanni Pisano who did not appreciate Antiquity in the same manner. Both styles coexisted for several generations. International Gothic and its variations became briefly more popular in the Early 15th century than the Classicism of the High Renaissance.

Nicola Pisano has pushed 13th-century Tuscan sculpture in the direction of art that integrated the features of Roman art, while simultaneously staying attached to the Gothic art from Northern Europe. The true inheritor of Nicola&#x27;s classical style was Arnolfo di Cambio (–1302), whose early death left the field clear for Giovanni Pisano, who, by then, was already pursuing his own mixture of French Gothic and the classical style.

Giorgio Vasari included a biography of Nicola Pisano in his &quot;Lives&quot;.

<text>The Paymaster of the Forces was a position in the British government. The office was established in 1661, one year after the Restoration of the Monarchy to Charles II of England, and was responsible for part of the financing of the British Army, in the improved form created by Oliver Cromwell during the Commonwealth. The full title was Paymaster-General of His Majesty&#x27;s Forces. It was abolished in 1836, near the end of the reign of William IV, and was replaced by the new post of Paymaster General.

==History==

The first to hold the office was Sir Stephen Fox (1627–1716), an exceptionally able administrator who had remained a member of the household of King Charles II during his exile in France. Before his time, and before the Civil War, there was no standing army and it had been the custom to appoint treasurers-at-war, &quot;ad hoc&quot;, for campaigns. Within a generation of the Restoration, the status of the paymastership began to change. In 1692 the then paymaster, Richard Jones, 1st Earl of Ranelagh, was made a member of the Privy Council; and thereafter every paymaster, or when there were two paymasters at least one of them, joined the Privy Council if not already a member. From the accession of Queen Anne the paymaster tended to change with the government. By the 18th century the office had become a political prize and potentially the most lucrative that a parliamentary career could obtain. Appointments to the office were therefore made often not due to merit alone, but also to political affiliation. It was occasionally a cabinet-level post in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and many future prime ministers served as paymaster.
Before the development of the banking system, the duty of the paymaster was to act as the personal sole domestic banker of the army. He received, mainly from the Exchequer, the sums voted by Parliament for military expenditure. Other sums were also received, for example from the sale of old stores. He disbursed these sums, by his own hands or by deputy paymasters, under the authority of sign-manual warrants for ordinary expenses of the army, and under Treasury warrants for extraordinary expenses (expenses unforeseen and unprovided for by Parliament).

During the whole time in which public money was in his hands, from the day of receipt until the receipt of his final discharge (the &quot;&quot; of the Pipe Office), he assumed unlimited personal liability for the funds, thus his private estate was liable for the money in his hands. Failing the &quot;quietus&quot; this liability remained without limit of time, passing on his death to his heirs and legal representatives.

Appointments were made by the Crown by letters patent under the Great Seal. The patent salary was £400 from 1661 to 1680 and 20 shillings a day thereafter, except for the years 1702–07 when it was fixed at 10 shillings a day.

The office of Paymaster of the Forces was abolished in 1836 and superseded with the formation of the post of Paymaster General.

==List of Paymasters of the Forces==
&quot;Office merged into that of Paymaster General, 1836.&quot;

==Paymaster of the Forces Abroad==
From 1702 to 1714, during the War of the Spanish Succession, there was a distinct Paymaster of the Forces Abroad, appointed in the same manner as the Paymaster. These were appointed to a special office to oversee the pay of Queen Anne&#x27;s army in the Low Countries, and are not in the regular succession of Paymasters of the Forces. The salary of the position was 10 shillings a day. Colonel Thomas Moore was paymaster of the land forces in Minorca and in the garrisons of Dunkirk and Gibraltar and is not always counted among the Paymasters of the Forces Abroad.

<doc id="237478" wikidata="Q864943" url="?curid=237478" title="Sid Meier's Colonization">
<text>Sid Meier&#x27;s Colonization is a video game by Brian Reynolds and Sid Meier. It was developed by MicroProse&#x27;s Chapel Hill development studio and was released in 1994. It is a turn-based strategy game themed on the early European colonization of the New World, starting in 1492 and lasting until 1850. It was originally released for DOS, and later ported to Windows 3.1 (1995), the Amiga (1995), and Macintosh (1995). American video game publisher Tommo purchased the rights to this game in 2015 and digitally published it through their Retroism brand.

&quot;Colonization&quot; is much like a more-developed version of Sid Meier&#x27;s previous game &quot;Civilization&quot; (1991) in visual design and handling, but the two have marked differences in gameplay. Instead of forging a nation from nothing, the player manages the cross-Atlantic expansion of an established one in the service of the Crown. As the colonies become more self-sufficient, their relationship with the colonial power declines from being beneficial to harmful, and to win the player must ultimately declare independence and defeat the Royal Expeditionary Force in battle.

==Gameplay==

The game begins in 1492. The player controls the colonial forces of either England, France, the Netherlands, or Spain; the other powers are then played by the computer. Each nation has distinct abilities that favor certain strategies. There is a choice between a historical map (America) or a randomly generated map (the New World), and players may also create their own map with the included scenario editor.

The journey begins with a ship and two units arriving at the new world; as the ship moves into the unknown, the map is revealed. Subsequently, the player makes landfall, explores the New World, meets the indigenous Indians, builds colonies and buildings, and improves and works the surrounding land. The ship can return to Europe to collect more colonists and buy and sell items.

The colonists can work the immediate land around the colony. Different map squares yield different resources; for instance, most squares can produce food, while only forests can yield lumber. Resources harvested from the land, such as cotton or tobacco, can be processed and converted into commodities, such as cloth and cigars, and sold at a greater profit. Commodity prices in Europe fluctuate depending upon supply and demand. With money, the player is able to buy goods, fund faster building construction, recruit new colonists, and buy ships and artillery. The king may at different times raise colonial taxes to pay for a war taking place in Europe or for some other reason.

The player is also required to protect their colonies from potential invasion by equipping and stationing soldiers. Moreover, the player manages their citizens, educating them in various skills to increase their productivity in areas such as farming, resource gathering and manufacturing.

Players may send missionaries into Indian villages to convert them to Christianity. The Indians may accept and convert, or they may refuse and burn the missionary at the stake. If another colonial power has already established a mission in a village, a missionary may attempt to denounce them as heretics; this has a 50% chance of succeeding.

When waging war, the player has a basic colonial army consisting of militiamen, artillery, cavalry, and ships. Weapons and soldiers can be purchased from Europe; however, to win independence, the player will need to develop a home-grown arms industry. Indians will initially only have braves and no horses or guns; over time they may obtain them via trade or by defeating colonial forces in battle. Guns and horses must be available in a colony to equip citizens and turn them into soldiers. If a colonial power captures a colony, it will remain in their possession unless it is retaken by force. Indians will destroy a colony if they capture it.

Colonies are most often built on the coast; although they can be built inland, the player must build wagons to transport goods between inland colonies. In addition, it is preferable to use wagons when trading with Indian villages. Goods may be sold to rival colonial powers, sent back to Europe for sale, or sold to Indian villages.

Colonists come in four types. The first is the basic free citizen, who has no particular skills but performs any job adequately. If a citizen does the same job for a certain length of time, the game may upgrade him to a specialist in that particular job. The second type of colonist is the indentured servant. He is suitable at unskilled tasks, but less productive at skilled trades. If he is educated for enough time, he may become a free citizen. The third is the petty criminal. Like the indentured servant, petty criminals are only useful for unskilled labor. Petty criminals can eventually become free citizens through military service. If they survive enough battles eventually they are promoted to indentured servant followed eventually by free citizen. All free citizens can become veterans by winning enough battles.

Citizens may also travel to an Indian village and learn a skill from the natives such as tobacco planting. The Indians will not permit petty criminals to live among them, but will teach free citizens and indentured servants. In addition, missionaries may convert Indians to Christianity and convince them to live in the player&#x27;s towns, where they are a little better than free citizens at working the land (and unlike specialists, are better at any type of it), but poor at industrial trades.

Specialists are citizens who are trained and skilled at a specific profession. These can be free citizens, indentured servants, or petty criminals who learned the profession by doing the job, through education, or by visiting an Indian village (except criminals), or they can be pre-existing specialists (obtained via European immigration). Some professions, for example growing cotton, sugar and tobacco, can only be learned in Indian villages or in a colony as they are unknown in Europe. Eventually the player can build schoolhouses where they can teach their citizens to become specialists in specific professions. The player may at any time unassign a specialist and turn him back into an ordinary free citizen.

Horses can be imported from Europe. If any colony produces food to excess and has two or more horses, the horses will breed. An unskilled colonist (including a petty criminal) who enters a neutral or friendly Indian village on horseback may (rarely) be killed, may be given a gift, or may be promoted to be a specialist scout. Seasoned scouts have a better chance to meet with a favorable reaction when entering a village, and an improved chance of discovering a fabled Fountain of Youth when investigating ancient ruins. This causes a sudden influx of potential colonists to the player&#x27;s European port. Further, mounted soldiers are more effective and have a better survival rate than dismounted infantry.

Each colonial power has certain bonuses that make them different from each other. Aside from European colonial powers, the NPC powers include eight Native American tribes, in four main categories. Each Native American settlement can convert one regular colonist into a specialist. More advanced tribes (Incas and Aztecs) live in larger cities. 

Analogous to &quot;Wonders of the World&quot; in the &quot;Civilization&quot; series of games, social and industrial advances are achieved by the addition of &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; to the &quot;Continental Congress&quot;, which are gained by generating a sufficient number of &quot;Liberty Bells&quot; through the colonial pride of settlers. These are all named after real historical figures, such as Francisco Coronado and Pocahontas.

One main driving impulse in &quot;Colonization&quot; is the harvesting of natural resources, such as lumber (for building), ore (for manufacturing), and food (for population growth). Squares on the map have basic values of resource output (depending on the type of terrain and if a river runs through it), but certain &quot;prime&quot; squares have higher or double output values, making them highly desirable. Pioneers can, at the cost of expending tools, create roads on tiles, increasing their yield and removing terrain movement penalties, or remove features such as forests to make room for agriculture. They can also &quot;plow&quot; flat terrain to increase agricultural yields.

The ultimate goal of the game is winning independence from the mother country. When the player has a sufficiently high percentage of &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, he may choose to declare independence. He then has to defeat most of the King&#x27;s army to win, which is not an easy task as the royal army and navy are individually more powerful and usually more numerous than the player&#x27;s colonial forces, although the King&#x27;s troops are unused to fighting in the New World and are more easily defeated in rough terrain. Other colonial powers may help with the enterprise, analogous to the French intervention in the American Revolutionary War. Of course, if the player has a large enough treasury, another foreign power may provide military aid in the form of mercenaries.

==Development==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s &quot;The Rumor Bag&quot; column reported in April 1994 that &quot;MicroProse is working on a game like &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot; that covers the Age of Colonization&quot;.

GOG.com released an emulated version for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X in 2012.

== Reception ==
Sales of &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Colonization&quot; surpassed 350,000 copies by September 1997.

In 1996, &quot;Colonization&quot; was ranked the fourth best game of all time by &quot;Amiga Power&quot;. It was named the 52nd best computer game ever by &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; in 1997.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;MPS Labs borrowed heavily from classic hits of the past to create a surprisingly addictive title with a flavor all its own.&quot;

==Remakes==
&quot;FreeCol&quot; released in 2003, is an open-source and fan-made remake of &quot;Colonization&quot;. It is under continued development.

The 2008 release &quot;Civilization IV: Colonization&quot; is a Firaxis remake of the original &quot;Colonization&quot; for Microsoft Windows. It uses the upgraded &quot;Civilization IV&quot; engine and features the original gameplay (with some changes, particularly to colonist education), 3D graphics, an updated AI, and multiplayer support.

<text>Flexor digitorum superficialis (&quot;flexor digitorum sublimis&quot;) or flexor digitorum communis sublimis is an extrinsic flexor muscle of the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints.

It is in the anterior compartment of the forearm. It is sometimes considered to be the deepest part of the superficial layer of this compartment, and sometimes considered to be a distinct, &quot;intermediate layer&quot; of this compartment. It is relatively common for the Flexor digitorum superficialis to be missing from the little finger, bilaterally and unilaterally, which can cause problems when diagnosing a little finger injury.

==Structure==
The muscle has two classically described heads – the humeroulnar and radial – and it is between these heads that the median nerve and ulnar artery pass. The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint gives its origin to part of this muscle.

Four long tendons come off this muscle near the wrist and travel through the carpal tunnel formed by the flexor retinaculum. These tendons, along with those of flexor digitorum profundus, are enclosed by a common flexor sheath. The tendons attach to the anterior margins on the bases of the intermediate phalanges of the four fingers. These tendons have a split (Camper&#x27;s Chiasm) at the end of them through which the tendons of flexor digitorum profundus pass.

===Innervation===
The Flexor digitorium superficialis muscle is innervated by the median nerve (C7, C8, T1).

==Function==
The primary function of flexor digitorum superficialis is flexion of the middle phalanges of the four fingers (excluding the thumb) at the proximal interphalangeal joints, however under continued action it also flexes the metacarpophalangeal joints and wrist joint.

To test flexor digitorum superficialis, one finger is flexed at the proximal interphalangeal joint against resistance, while the remaining three fingers are held fully extended (to inactivate flexor digitorum profundus).

<text>Massachusetts Bay is a bay on the Gulf of Maine that forms part of the central coastline of Massachusetts.

==Description==
The bay extends from Cape Ann on the north to Plymouth Harbor on the south, a distance of about . Its northern and southern shores incline toward each other through the entrance to Boston Harbor, where they are about five miles apart. The depth from the base of the triangle to Boston Harbor is about . The westmost point of the bay is at the city of Boston.

The northern shore of Massachusetts Bay is rocky and irregular, but the southern shore is low, marshy, and sandy. Along the shores are a number of capes and headlands, and off the coast a number of small islands, especially in the entrance to Boston Harbor. The principal inlets are: on the north coast, Gloucester Harbor, Nahant Bay, Salem Harbor, Marblehead Harbor, and Lynn Harbor, and on the west, Boston Harbor, Dorchester Bay, and Quincy Bay (the two latter being part of the Outer Boston Harbor), and on the south coast, Hingham Bay. Massachusetts Bay is itself part of the Gulf of Maine, which extends from Nova Scotia south to Cape Cod Bay. Cape Cod Bay is sometimes considered to be part of Massachusetts Bay. Under this interpretation, the name &quot;Massachusetts Bay&quot; denotes the entire rectangular area of ocean between Cape Ann and Cape Cod.

==Massachusetts Bay Disposal Site==
The Massachusetts Bay Disposal Site in deep water off the coast has been used for ocean dumping, to dispose of munitions, dredged material, rock and construction debris and sunken vessels. Chemical warfare munitions were dumped between 1919 and 1970, and hundreds of thousands of tons of surplus artillery and munitions were dumped after World War II. The majority later washed up on shore. Most of them are inert unexploded ordnance, but occasionally they are live. Fishermen have brought a torpedo into Provincetown, a depth charge into Gloucester, and mustard munitions into New Bedford.

<doc id="237489" wikidata="Q1310859" url="?curid=237489" title="Retsina">
<text>Retsina () is a Greek white (or rosé or very rarely red) resinated wine, which has been made for at least 2,000 years. Its unique flavor is said to have originated from the practice of sealing wine vessels, particularly amphorae, with Aleppo pine resin in ancient times. Before the invention of impermeable glass bottles, oxygen caused many wines to spoil within the year. Pine resin helped keep air out, while infusing the wine with resin aroma. The Romans began to use barrels in the 3rd century AD, removing any oenological necessity for resin, but the flavor itself was so popular that the style is still widespread today.

==History==
The earliest recorded mention of using resin with wine amphorae is by the first-century Roman writer Columella, who detailed in his work &quot;De Re Rustica&quot; (12,20,3 and 12,22,2) the different types of resin that could be used to seal a container or be mixed into the wine. He recommended, however, that the very best wines should not be mixed with resin because of the unpleasant flavor introduced thereby. His contemporary, Pliny the Elder, does recommend the use of adding resin to the fermenting wine must in his work &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (14.124) with the resin from mountainous areas having a better aroma than those that come from lower lands (16.60).

The Roman settlements in Illyria, Cisalpine Gaul and Gallia Narbonensis did not use resin-coated amphorae due to the lack of suitable local pine trees and began to develop solid, less leak-prone wooden barrels in the 1st century AD. By the 3rd century, barrel making was prevalent throughout the Roman Empire. The exception was the eastern empire regions of Byzantium which had developed a taste for the strong, pungent wine and continued to produce resinated wine long after the Western Roman Empire stopped. The difference in taste between the two empires took center stage in the work of the historian Liutprand of Cremona and his &quot;Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitana&quot;. In 968, Liutprand was sent to Constantinople to arrange a marriage between the daughter of the late Emperor Romanos II and the future Holy Roman Emperor Otto II. According to Liutprand, he was treated very rudely and in an undignified manner by the court of Nikephoros II, being served goat stuffed with onion and served in fish sauce and &quot;undrinkable&quot; wine mixed with resin, pitch and gypsum—very offensive to his Germanic tastes.

Pilgrims and Crusaders to the Holy Land during the Middle Ages recorded their experiences with the strong, resin wines of the Greek islands. Pietro Casola, an Italian noble who traveled to Jerusalem in 1494, wrote about the wines and cuisines of the places he stopped at along the way. In one of his entries, about his visit to Modone on Peloponnese, he wrote about the bounty of good quality wines made from Malmsey, Muscatel and Rumney varieties. Everything he tried was pleasing, except the strong, resinated wine with an unpleasant odour.

===Anecdotal history===
Popular anecdotes about the evolution of retsina stem from the Roman conquest of Greece. Stories claim that the Romans plundered the wines of Greece, angering the citizens, who turned to pine resin as a way of extending their store of wine and as a deterrent to their thirsty conquerors. The harsh flavor was said to put off the Romans, who refused to drink the bitter ferment. Another anecdote claims that an excess of undiluted retsina was lethal for King Eric I of Denmark and Sigurd I of Norway.

==Wine regions==

In Greece, local retsina is produced throughout the country. Major production centers around Attica, Boeotia and Euboea. The European Union treats the name &quot;retsina&quot; as a protected designation of origin and traditional appellation for Greece and parts of the southern regions of Cyprus. An Australian wine style made in South Australia can be called &quot;resinated wine&quot; but not &quot;retsina&quot;.

==Grapes and winemaking==
Today the traditional grape for retsina is Savatiano with Assyrtiko and Rhoditis sometimes blended in, as well as other grape varieties throughout Greece. On the island of Rhodes, Athiri is the main grape. Modern retsina is made following the same winemaking techniques of white wine or rosé, except for small pieces of Aleppo pine resin added to the must during fermentation. The pieces stay mixed with the must, and elute an oily resin film on the liquid surface; at racking the wine is clarified and the solids and surface film are removed from the finished wine. Nowadays, protecting the new wine from oxidation is easy to do with far simpler means and much less resin is used than traditionally called for. Such wines lack the pungent &quot;whiff of turpentine&quot; streak of old, and are considered ideal accompaniments to such strong-tasting local cuisine as pastırma or garlic dips, which are often consumed as mezes with alcoholic beverages.

<text>A management information system (MIS) is an information system used for decision-making, and for the coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of information in an organization. The study of the management information systems involves people, processes and technology in an organizational context. In other words, it serves, as the functions of controlling, planning, decision making in the management level setting.

In a corporate setting, the ultimate goal of using management information system is to increase the value and profits of the business.

== History ==
While it can be contested that the history of management information systems dates as far back as companies using ledgers to keep track of accounting, the modern history of MIS can be divided into five &quot;eras&quot; originally identified by Kenneth C. Laudon and Jane Laudon in their seminal textbook &quot;Management Information Systems.&quot;

* First era – Mainframe and minicomputer computing
* Second era – Personal computers
* Third era – Client/server networks
* Fourth era – Enterprise computing 
* Fifth era – Cloud computing

The &quot;first era&quot; (mainframe and minicomputer computing) was ruled by IBM and their mainframe computers for which they supplied both the hardware and software. These computers would often take up whole rooms and require teams to run them. As technology advanced, these computers were able to handle greater capacities and therefore reduce their cost. Smaller, more affordable minicomputers allowed larger businesses to run their own computing centers in-house / on-site / on-premises.

The &quot;second era&quot; (personal computers) began in 1965 as microprocessors started to compete with mainframes and minicomputers and accelerated the process of decentralizing computing power from large data centers to smaller offices. In the late 1970s, minicomputer technology gave way to personal computers and relatively low-cost computers were becoming mass market commodities, allowing businesses to provide their employees access to computing power that ten years before would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. This proliferation of computers created a ready market for interconnecting networks and the popularization of the Internet. (The first microprocessor—a four-bit device intended for a programmable calculator—was introduced in 1971, and microprocessor-based systems were not readily available for several years. The MITS Altair 8800 was the first commonly known microprocessor-based system, followed closely by the Apple I and II. It is arguable that the microprocessor-based system did not make significant inroads into minicomputer use until 1979, when VisiCalc prompted record sales of the Apple II on which it ran. The IBM PC introduced in 1981 was more broadly palatable to business, but its limitations gated its ability to challenge minicomputer systems until perhaps the late 1980s to early 1990s.)

The &quot;third era&quot; (client/server networks) arose as technological complexity increased, costs decreased, and the end-user (now the ordinary employee) required a system to share information with other employees within an enterprise. Computers on a common network shared information on a server. This lets thousands and even millions of people access data simultaneously on networks referred to as Intranets.

The &quot;fourth era&quot; (enterprise computing) enabled by high speed networks, consolidated the original department specific software applications into integrated software platforms referred to as enterprise software. This new platform tied all aspects of the business enterprise together offering rich information access encompassing the complete managerial structure.

== Technology ==
The terms management information system (MIS), Information management system (IMS), information system (IS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), computer science, electrical computer engineering, and information technology management (IT) are often confused. MIS is a hierarchical subset of information systems. MIS is more organization-focused narrowing in on leveraging information technology to increase business value. Computer science is more software-focused dealing with the applications that may be used in MIS. Electrical computer engineering is product-focused mainly dealing with the hardware architecture behind computer systems. ERP software is a subset of MIS and IT management refers to the technical management of an IT department which may include MIS.

A career in MIS focuses on understanding and projecting the practical use of management information systems. It studies the interaction, organization and processes among technology, people and information to solve problems.

== Management ==
While management information systems can be used by any or every level of management, the decision of which systems to implement generally falls upon the chief information officers (CIO) and chief technology officers (CTO). These officers are generally responsible for the overall technology strategy of an organization including evaluating how new technology can help their organization. They act as decision-makers in the implementation process of the new MIS.

Once decisions have been made, IT directors, including MIS directors, are in charge of the technical implementation of the system. They are also in charge of implementing the policies affecting the MIS (either new specific policies passed down by the CIOs or CTOs or policies that align the new systems with the organization&#x27;s overall IT policy). It is also their role to ensure the availability of data and network services as well as the security of the data involved by coordinating IT activities.

Upon implementation, the assigned users will have appropriate access to relevant information. It is important to note that not everyone inputting data into MIS needs to be at the management level. It is common practice to have inputs to MIS be inputted by non-managerial employees though they rarely have access to the reports and decision support platforms offered by these systems.

== Types ==
The following are types of information systems used to create reports, extract data, and assist in the decision-making processes of middle and operational level managers.

* Decision support systems (DSSs) are computer program applications used by middle and higher management to compile information from a wide range of sources to support problem solving and decision making. A DSS is used mostly for semi-structured and unstructured decision problems.
* Executive information system (EIS) is a reporting tool that provides quick access to summarized reports coming from all company levels and departments such as accounting, human resources and operations.
* Marketing information systems are management Information Systems designed specifically for managing the marketing aspects of the business.
*Accounting information systems are focused accounting functions.
*Human resource management systems are used for personnel aspects.
* Office automation systems (OAS) support communication and productivity in the enterprise by automating workflow and eliminating bottlenecks. OAS may be implemented at any and all levels of management.
* School Information Management Systems (SIMS) cover school administration, often including teaching and learning materials.
* Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software facilitates the flow of information between all business functions inside the boundaries of the organization and manage the connections to outside stakeholders.
* Customer Relationship Management (CRM) managing and analyzing customer interactions and data to improve customer relationships and enhance satisfaction.
* Local databases, can be small, simplified tools for managers and are considered to be a primal or base level version of a MIS.
* Dealership management systems (DMS) or auto dealership management systems are created specifically for the automotive industry, car dealerships or large equipment manufacturers. These systems contain software that meets the needs of the finance, sales, service, parts, inventory, and administration components of running the dealership. What distinguishes it from other management systems is that it has three distinct inventory systems and interfaces with the factory. For example, when a customer comes in to have their vehicle serviced, the DMS connects to the vehicle&#x27;s manufacturer and provides the service history and any open recalls for that vehicle.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The following are some of the benefits that can be attained using MIS:
* Improve an organization&#x27;s operational efficiency, add value to existing products, engender innovation and new product development, and help managers make better decisions.
* Companies are able to identify their strengths and weaknesses due to the presence of revenue reports, employee performance records etc. Identifying these aspects can help a company improve its business processes and operations.
* The availability of customer data and feedback can help the company to align its business processes according to the needs of its customers. The effective management of customer data can help the company to perform direct marketing and promotion activities.
*MIS can help a company gain a competitive advantage.
*MIS reports can help with decision-making as well as reduce downtime for actionable items.

Some of the disadvantages of MIS systems:

* Retrieval and dissemination are dependent on technology hardware and software.
* Potential for inaccurate information.

== Enterprise applications ==
* &quot;Enterprise systems&quot;—also known as &quot;enterprise resource planning (ERP)&quot; systems—provide integrated software modules and a unified database that personnel use to plan, manage, and control core business processes across multiple locations. Modules of ERP systems may include finance, accounting, marketing, human resources, production, inventory management, and distribution.
* &quot;Supply chain management (SCM)&quot; systems enable more efficient management of the supply chain by integrating the links in a supply chain. This may include suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and final customers.
* &quot;Customer relationship management (CRM)&quot; systems help businesses manage relationships with potential and current customers and business partners across marketing, sales, and service.
* &quot;Knowledge management system (KMS)&quot; helps organizations facilitate the collection, recording, organization, retrieval, and dissemination of knowledge. This may include documents, accounting records, unrecorded procedures, practices, and skills. Knowledge management (KM) as a system covers the process of knowledge creation and acquisition from internal processes and the external world. The collected knowledge is incorporated in organizational policies and procedures, and then disseminated to the stakeholders.

<text>An information system (IS) is a formal, sociotechnical, organizational system designed to collect, process, store, and distribute information. From a sociotechnical perspective, information systems comprise four components: task, people, structure (or roles), and technology. Information systems can be defined as an integration of components for collection, storage and processing of data, comprising digital products that process data to facilitate decision making and the data being used to provide information and contribute to knowledge. 

A computer information system is a system, which consists of people and computers that process or interpret information. The term is also sometimes used to simply refer to a computer system with software installed.

&quot;Information systems&quot; is also an academic field of study about systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of computer hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute data. An emphasis is placed on an information system having a definitive boundary, users, processors, storage, inputs, outputs and the aforementioned communication networks.

In many organizations, the department or unit responsible for information systems and data processing is known as &quot;information services&quot;.

Any specific information system aims to support operations, management and decision-making. An information system is the information and communication technology (ICT) that an organization uses, and also the way in which people interact with this technology in support of business processes.

Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, computer systems, and business processes. Information systems typically include an ICT component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end-use of information technology. Information systems are also different from business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of business processes.

Alter argues that viewing an information system as a special type of work system has its advantages. A work system is a system in which humans or machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific products or services for customers. An information system is a work system in which activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying information.

As such, information systems inter-relate with data systems on the one hand and activity systems on the other. An information system is a form of communication system in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory. An information system can also be considered a semi-formal language which supports human decision making and action.

Information systems are the primary focus of study for organizational informatics.

==Overview==
Silver et al. (1995) provided two views on IS that includes software, hardware, data, people, and procedures.

The Association for Computing Machinery defines &quot;Information systems specialists [as] focus[ing] on integrating information technology solutions and business processes to meet the information needs of businesses and other enterprises.&quot;

There are various types of information systems, : including transaction processing systems, decision support systems, knowledge management systems, learning management systems, database management systems, and office information systems. Critical to most information systems are information technologies, which are typically designed to enable humans to perform tasks for which the human brain is not well suited, such as: handling large amounts of information, performing complex calculations, and controlling many simultaneous processes.

Information technologies are a very important and malleable resource available to executives. Many companies have created a position of chief information officer (CIO) that sits on the executive board with the chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), and chief technical officer (CTO). The CTO may also serve as CIO, and vice versa. The chief information security officer (CISO) focuses on information security management.

===Six components===
The &quot;six components&quot; that must come together in order to produce an information system are:
#&quot;Hardware&quot;: The term hardware refers to machinery and equipment. In a modern information system, this category includes the computer itself and all of its support equipment. The support equipment includes input and output devices, storage devices and communications devices. In pre-computer information systems, the hardware might include ledger books and ink.
#&quot;Software&quot;: The term software refers to computer programs and the manuals (if any) that support them. Computer programs are machine-readable instructions that direct the circuitry within the hardware parts of the system to function in ways that produce useful information from data. Programs are generally stored on some input/output medium, often a disk or tape. The &quot;software&quot; for pre-computer information systems included how the hardware was prepared for use (e.g., column headings in the ledger book) and instructions for using them (the guidebook for a card catalog).
#&quot;Data&quot;: Data are facts that are used by systems to produce useful information. In modern information systems, data are generally stored in machine-readable form on disk or tape until the computer needs them. In pre-computer information systems, the data were generally stored in human-readable form.
#&quot;Procedures&quot;: Procedures are the policies that govern the operation of an information system. &quot;Procedures are to people what software is to hardware&quot; is a common analogy that is used to illustrate the role of procedures in a system.
#&quot;People&quot;: Every system needs people if it is to be useful. Often the most overlooked element of the system is the people, probably the component that most influences the success or failure of information systems. This includes &quot;not only the users, but those who operate and service the computers, those who maintain the data, and those who support the network of computers&quot;.
#&quot;Internet&quot;: The internet is a combination of data and people. (Although this component is not necessary for functionality.)

Data is the bridge between hardware and people. This means that the data we collect is only data until we involve people. At that point, data becomes information.

==Types==
The &quot;classic&quot; view of Information systems found in textbooks in the 1980s was a pyramid of systems that reflected the hierarchy of the organization, usually transaction processing systems at the bottom of the pyramid, followed by management information systems, decision support systems, and ending with executive information systems at the top. Although the pyramid model remains useful since it was first formulated, a number of new technologies have been developed and new categories of information systems have emerged, some of which no longer fit easily into the original pyramid model.

Some examples of such systems are:

* Artificial intelligence system
* Computing platform
* Data warehouses
* Decision support system
* Enterprise resource planning
* Enterprise systems
* Expert systems
* Geographic information system
* Global information system
* Management information system
* Multimedia information system
* Office automation
* Process control system
* Search engines
* Social information systems
A computer(-based) information system is essentially an IS using computer technology to carry out some or all of its planned tasks. The basic components of computer-based information systems are:
*&quot;Hardware&quot; are the devices like the monitor, processor, printer, and keyboard, all of which work together to accept, process, show data, and information.
*&quot;Software&quot; are the programs that allow the hardware to process the data.
*&quot;Databases&quot; are the gathering of associated files or tables containing related data.
*&quot;Networks&quot; are a connecting system that allows diverse computers to distribute resources.
*&quot;Procedures&quot; are the commands for combining the components above to process information and produce the preferred output.

The first four components (hardware, software, database, and network) make up what is known as the information technology platform.
Information technology workers could then use these components to create information systems that watch over safety measures, risk and the management of data. These actions are known as information technology services.

Certain information systems support parts of organizations, others support entire organizations, and still others, support groups of organizations. Each department or functional area within an organization has its own collection of application programs or information systems. These functional area information systems (FAIS) are supporting pillars for more general IS namely, business intelligence systems and dashboards. As the name suggests, each FAIS supports a particular function within the organization, e.g.: accounting IS, finance IS, production-operation management (POM) IS, marketing IS, and human resources IS. In finance and accounting, managers use IT systems to forecast revenues and business activity, to determine the best sources and uses of funds, and to perform audits to ensure that the organization is fundamentally sound and that all financial reports and documents are accurate.

Other types of organizational information systems are FAIS, transaction processing systems, enterprise resource planning, office automation system, management information system, decision support system, expert system, executive dashboard, supply chain management system, and electronic commerce system. Dashboards are a special form of IS that support all managers of the organization. They provide rapid access to timely information and direct access to structured information in the form of reports. Expert systems attempt to duplicate the work of human experts by applying reasoning capabilities, knowledge, and expertise within a specific domain.

==Development==
Information technology departments in larger organizations tend to strongly influence the development, use, and application of information technology in the business.
A series of methodologies and processes can be used to develop and use an information system. Many developers use a systems engineering approach such as the system development life cycle (SDLC), to systematically develop an information system in stages. The stages of the system development lifecycle are planning, system analysis, and requirements, system design, development, integration and testing, implementation and operations, and maintenance.
Recent research aims at enabling and measuring the ongoing, collective development of such systems within an organization by the entirety of human actors themselves.
An information system can be developed in house (within the organization) or outsourced. This can be accomplished by outsourcing certain components or the entire system. A specific case is the geographical distribution of the development team (offshoring, global information system).

A computer-based information system, following a definition of Langefors, is a technologically implemented medium for recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions, as well as for drawing conclusions from such expressions.

Geographic information systems, land information systems, and disaster information systems are examples of emerging information systems, but they can be broadly considered as spatial information systems.
System development is done in stages which include:
* Problem recognition and specification
* Information gathering
* Requirements specification for the new system
* System design
* System construction
* System implementation
* Review and maintenance

==As an academic discipline==
The field of study called &quot;information systems&quot; encompasses a variety of topics including systems analysis and design, computer networking, information security, database management, and decision support systems. &quot;Information management&quot; deals with the practical and theoretical problems of collecting and analyzing information in a business function area including business productivity tools, applications programming and implementation, electronic commerce, digital media production, data mining, and decision support. &quot;Communications and networking&quot; deals with telecommunication technologies. 
Information systems bridges business and computer science using the theoretical foundations of information and computation to study various business models and related algorithmic processes on building the IT systems within a computer science discipline. &quot;Computer information systems&quot; (CIS) is a field studying computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their software and hardware designs, their applications, and their impact on society, whereas IS emphasizes functionality over design.

Several IS scholars have debated the nature and foundations of information systems which have its roots in other reference disciplines such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, management science, cybernetics, and others. Information systems also can be defined as a collection of hardware, software, data, people, and procedures that work together to produce quality information.

===Related terms===
Similar to computer science, other disciplines can be seen as both related and foundation disciplines of IS. The domain of study of IS involves the study of theories and practices related to the social and technological phenomena, which determine the development, use, and effects of information systems in organizations and society. But, while there may be considerable overlap of the disciplines at the boundaries, the disciplines are still differentiated by the focus, purpose, and orientation of their activities.

In a broad scope, &quot;information systems&quot; is a scientific field of study that addresses the range of strategic, managerial, and operational activities involved in the gathering, processing, storing, distributing, and use of information and its associated technologies in society and organizations. The term &quot;information systems&quot; is also used to describe an organizational function that applies IS knowledge in the industry, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations.

&quot;Information systems&quot; often refers to the interaction between algorithmic processes and technology. This interaction can occur within or across organizational boundaries. An information system is a technology an organization uses and also the way in which the organizations interact with the technology and the way in which the technology works with the organization&#x27;s business processes. Information systems are distinct from information technology (IT) in that an information system has an information technology component that interacts with the processes&#x27; components.

One problem with that approach is that it prevents the IS field from being interested in non-organizational use of ICT, such as in social networking, computer gaming, mobile personal usage, etc. A different way of differentiating the IS field from its neighbours is to ask, &quot;Which aspects of reality are most meaningful in the IS field and other fields?&quot; This approach, based on philosophy, helps to define not just the focus, purpose, and orientation, but also the dignity, destiny and, responsibility of the field among other fields.

Business informatics is a related discipline that is well-established in several countries, especially in Europe. While &quot;Information systems&quot; has been said to have an &quot;explanation-oriented&quot; focus, &quot;business informatics&quot; has a more &quot;solution-oriented&quot; focus and includes information technology elements and construction and implementation-oriented elements.

==Career pathways==

Information systems workers enter a number of different careers:
* Information system strategy
*Management information systems – A management information system (MIS) is an information system used for decision-making, and for the coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of information in an organization.
*Project management – Project management is the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time.
*Enterprise architecture – A well-defined practice for conducting enterprise analysis, design, planning, and implementation, using a comprehensive approach at all times, for the successful development and execution of strategy.
* IS development
* IS organization
* IS consulting
* IS security
* IS auditing

There is a wide variety of career paths in the information systems discipline. &quot;Workers with specialized technical knowledge and strong communications skills will have the best prospects. Workers with management skills and an understanding of business practices and principles will have excellent opportunities, as companies are increasingly looking to technology to drive their revenue.&quot;

Information technology is important to the operation of contemporary businesses, it offers many employment opportunities. The information systems field includes the people in organizations who design and build information systems, the people who use those systems, and the people responsible for managing those systems.
The demand for traditional IT staff such as programmers, business analysts, systems analysts, and designer is significant. Many well-paid jobs exist in areas of Information technology. At the top of the list is the chief information officer (CIO).

The CIO is the executive who is in charge of the IS function. In most organizations, the CIO works with the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief financial officer (CFO), and other senior executives. Therefore, he or she actively participates in the organization&#x27;s strategic planning process.

===Bachelor of Business Information Systems===
==Research==
Information systems research is generally interdisciplinary concerned with the study of the effects of information systems on the behaviour of individuals, groups, and organizations. Hevner et al. (2004) categorized research in IS into two scientific paradigms including &quot;behavioural science&quot; which is to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior and&quot; design science&quot; which extends the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts.

Salvatore March and Gerald Smith proposed a framework for researching different aspects of information technology including outputs of the research (research outputs) and activities to carry out this research (research activities). They identified research outputs as follows:

# &quot;Constructs&quot; which are concepts that form the vocabulary of a domain. They constitute a conceptualization used to describe problems within the domain and to specify their solutions.
# A &quot;model&quot; which is a set of propositions or statements expressing relationships among constructs.
# A &quot;method&quot; which is a set of steps (an algorithm or guideline) used to perform a task. Methods are based on a set of underlying constructs and a representation (model) of the solution space.
# An &quot;instantiation&quot; is the realization of an artefact in its environment.

Also research activities including:
# &quot;Build&quot; an artefact to perform a specific task.
# &quot;Evaluate&quot; the artefact to determine if any progress has been achieved.
# Given an artefact whose performance has been evaluated, it is important to determine why and how the artefact worked or did not work within its environment. Therefore, &quot;theorize&quot; and &quot;justify&quot; theories about IT artefacts.

Although Information Systems as a discipline has been evolving for over 30 years now, the core focus or identity of IS research is still subject to debate among scholars. There are two main views around this debate: a narrow view focusing on the IT artifact as the core subject matter of IS research, and a broad view that focuses on the interplay between social and technical aspects of IT that is embedded into a dynamic evolving context. A third view calls on IS scholars to pay balanced attention to both the IT artifact and its context.

Since the study of information systems is an applied field, industry practitioners expect information systems research to generate findings that are immediately applicable in practice. This is not always the case however, as information systems researchers often explore behavioral issues in much more depth than practitioners would expect them to do. This may render information systems research results difficult to understand, and has led to criticism.

In the last ten years, the business trend is represented by the considerable increase of Information Systems Function (ISF) role, especially with regard to the enterprise strategies and operations supporting. It became a key factor to increase productivity and to support value creation. To study an information system itself, rather than its effects, information systems models are used, such as EATPUT.

The international body of Information Systems researchers, the Association for Information Systems (AIS), and its Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee on Journals (202), proposed a list of 11 journals that the AIS deems as &#x27;excellent&#x27;. According to the AIS, this list of journals recognizes topical, methodological, and geographical diversity. The review processes are stringent, editorial board members are widely-respected and recognized, and there is international readership and contribution. The list is (or should be) used, along with others, as a point of reference for promotion and tenure and, more generally, to evaluate scholarly excellence.

A number of annual information systems conferences are run in various parts of the world, the majority of which are peer reviewed. The AIS directly runs the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) and the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), while AIS affiliated conferences include the Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS), European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS), the Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (MCIS), the International Conference on Information Resources Management (Conf-IRM) and the Wuhan International Conference on E-Business (WHICEB). AIS chapter conferences include Australasian Conference on Information Systems (ACIS), Scandinavian Conference on Information Systems (SCIS), Information Systems International Conference (ISICO), Conference of the Italian Chapter of AIS (itAIS), Annual Mid-Western AIS Conference (MWAIS) and Annual Conference of the Southern AIS (SAIS). EDSIG, which is the special interest group on education of the AITP, organizes the Conference on Information Systems and Computing Education and the Conference on Information Systems Applied Research which are both held annually in November.

<doc id="237500" wikidata="Q1345851" url="?curid=237500" title="Headhunting">
<text>Headhunting is the practice of hunting a human and collecting the severed head after killing the victim, although sometimes more portable body parts (such as ear, nose, or scalp) are taken instead as trophies. Headhunting was practiced in historic times in parts of Europe, East Asia, Oceania, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Mesoamerica, South America, West Africa, and Central Africa.

The headhunting practice has been the subject of intense study within the anthropological community, where scholars try to assess and interpret its social roles, functions, and motivations. Anthropological writings explore themes in headhunting that include mortification of the rival, ritual violence, cosmological balance, the display of manhood, cannibalism, dominance over the body and soul of his enemies in life and afterlife, as a trophy and proof of killing (achievement in hunting), show of greatness, prestige by taking on a rival&#x27;s spirit and power, and as a means of securing the services of the victim as a slave in the afterlife.

Today&#x27;s scholars generally agree that headhunting&#x27;s primary function was ritual and ceremonial. It was part of the process of structuring, reinforcing, and defending hierarchical relationships between communities and individuals. Some experts theorize that the practice stemmed from the belief that the head contained &quot;soul matter&quot; or life force, which could be harnessed through its capture.

==Austronesia==
Among the various Austronesian peoples, head-hunting raids were strongly tied to the practice of tattooing. In head-hunting societies, tattoos were records of how many heads the warriors had taken in battle, and was part of the initiation rites into adulthood. The number and location of tattoos, therefore, were indicative of a warrior&#x27;s status and prowess.

===Indonesia and Malaysia===
In Southeast Asia, anthropological writings have explored headhunting and other practices of the Murut, Dusun Lotud, Iban, Berawan, Wana and Mappurondo tribes. Among these groups, headhunting was usually a ritual activity rather than an act of war or feuding. A warrior would take a single head. Headhunting acted as a catalyst for the cessation of personal and collective mourning for the community&#x27;s dead. Ideas of manhood and marriage were encompassed in the practice, and the taken heads were highly prized. Other reasons for headhunting included capture of enemies as slaves, looting of valuable properties, intra and inter-ethnic conflicts, and territorial expansion.

Italian anthropologist and explorer Elio Modigliani visited the headhunting communities in South Nias (an island to the west of Sumatra) in 1886; he wrote a detailed study of their society and beliefs. He found that the main purpose of headhunting was the belief that, if a man owned another person&#x27;s skull, his victim would serve as a slave of the owner for eternity in the afterlife. Human skulls were a valuable commodity. Sporadic headhunting continued in Nias island until the late 20th century, the last reported incident dating from 1998.

Headhunting was practiced among Sumba people until the early 20th century. It was done only in large war parties. When the men hunted wild animals, by contrast, they operated in silence and secrecy. The skulls collected were hung on the skull tree erected in the center of village.

Kenneth George wrote about annual headhunting rituals that he observed among the Mappurondo religious minority, an upland tribe in the southwest part of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Heads are not taken; instead, surrogate heads in the form of coconuts are used in a ritual ceremony. The ritual, called &quot;pangngae,&quot; takes place at the conclusion of the rice-harvesting season. It functions to bring an end to communal mourning for the deceased of the past year; express intercultural tensions and polemics; allow for a display of manhood; distribute communal resources; and resist outside pressures to abandon Mappurondo ways of life.
In Sarawak, the north-western region of the island of Borneo, the first &quot;White Rajah&quot; James Brooke and his descendants established a dynasty. They eradicated headhunting in the hundred years before World War II. Before Brooke&#x27;s arrival, the Iban had migrated from the middle Kapuas region into the upper Batang Lupar river region by fighting and displacing the small existing tribes, such as the Seru and Bukitan. Another successful migration by the Iban was from the Saribas region into the Kanowit area in the middle of the Batang Rajang river, led by the famous Mujah &quot;Buah Raya&quot;. They fought and displaced such tribes as the Kanowit and Baketan.

Brooke first encountered the headhunting Iban of the Saribas-Skrang in Sarawak at the Battle of Betting Maru in 1849. He gained the signing of the Saribas Treaty with the Iban chief of that region, who was named Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana &quot;Bayang&quot;. Subsequently, the Brooke dynasty expanded their territory from the first small Sarawak region to the present-day state of Sarawak. They enlisted the Malay, Iban, and other natives as a large unpaid force to defeat and pacify any rebellions in the states. The Brooke administration prohibited headhunting (&quot;ngayau&quot; in Iban language) and issued penalties for disobeying the Rajah-led government decree. During expeditions sanctioned by the Brooke administration, they allowed headhunting. The natives who participated in Brooke-approved punitive expeditions were exempted from paying annual tax to the Brooke administration and/or given new territories in return for their service. There were intra-tribal and intertribal headhunting.

The most famous Iban warrior to resist the authority of the Brooke administration was Libau &quot;Rentap&quot;. The Brooke government had to send three successive punitive expeditions in order to defeat Rentapi at his fortress on the top of Sadok Hill. Brooke&#x27;s force suffered major defeats during the first two expeditions. During the third and final expedition, Brooke built a large cannon called &quot;Bujang Sadok&quot; (Prince of Sadok Mount) to rival Rentap&#x27;s cannon nicknamed &quot;Bujang Timpang Berang&quot; (The One Arm Bachelor) and made a truce with the sons of a famous chief, who supported Rentap in not recognizing the government of Brooke due to his policies.

The Iban performed a third major migration from upper Batang Ai region in the Batang Lupar region into the Batang Kanyau (Embaloh) onwards the upper Katibas and then to the Baleh/Mujong regions in the upper Batang Rajang region. They displaced the existing tribes of the Kayan, Kajang, Ukit, etc. The Brooke administration sanctioned the last migrations of the Iban, and reduced any conflict to a minimum. The Iban conducted sacred ritual ceremonies with special and complex incantations to invoke god&#x27;s blessings, which were associated with headhunting. An example was the Bird Festival in the Saribas/Skrang region and Proper Festival in the Baleh region, both required for men of the tribes to become effective warriors.

During the Japanese occupation of British Borneo during the Second World War, headhunting was revived among the natives. The Sukarno-led Indonesian forces fought against the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Forces of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak fought in addition, and headhunting was observed during the communist insurgency in Sarawak and what was then Malaya. The Iban were noted for headhunting, and were later recognised as good rangers and trackers during military operations, during which they were awarded fourteen medals of valour and honour.

Since 1997 serious inter-ethnic violence has erupted on the island of Kalimantan, involving the indigenous Dayak peoples and immigrants from the island of Madura. Events have included the Sambas riots and Sampit conflict. In 2001, during the Sampit conflict in the Central Kalimantan town of Sampit, at least 500 Madurese were killed and up to 100,000 Madurese were forced to flee. Some Madurese bodies were decapitated in a ritual reminiscent of the Dayak headhunting tradition.

The Moluccans (especially Alfurs in Seram), an ethnic group of mixed Austronesian-Papuan origin living in the Maluku Islands, were fierce headhunters until the Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia suppressed the practice.

===Melanesia===
Headhunting was practiced by many Austronesian people in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Headhunting has at one time or another been practiced among most of the peoples of Melanesia, including New Guinea. A missionary found 10,000 skulls in a community longhouse on Goaribari Island in 1901.

Historically, the Marind-anim in New Guinea were famed because of their headhunting. The practice was rooted in their belief system and linked to the name-giving of the newborn. The skull was believed to contain a mana-like force. Headhunting was not motivated primarily by cannibalism, but the dead person&#x27;s flesh was consumed in ceremonies following the capture and killing.

The Korowai, a Papuan tribe in the southeast of Irian Jaya, live in tree houses, some nearly 40 metres (100&#x27;) high. This was originally believed to be a defensive practice, presumably as protection against the Citak, a tribe of neighbouring headhunters. Some researchers believe that the American Michael Rockefeller, who disappeared in New Guinea in 1961 while on a field trip, may have been taken by headhunters in the Asmat region. He was the son of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.

In &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot; (1911), the account by Jack London of his 1905 adventure sailing in Micronesia, he recounted that headhunters of Malaita attacked his ship during a stay in Langa Langa Lagoon, particularly around Laulasi Island. His and other ships were kidnapping villagers as workers on plantations, a practice known as blackbirding. Captain Mackenzie of the ship &quot;Minolta&quot; was beheaded by villagers as retribution for the loss of village men during an armed labour &quot;recruiting&quot; drive. The villagers believed that the ship&#x27;s crew &quot;owed&quot; several more heads before the score was even.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, the Maori preserved the heads of some of their ancestors as well as certain enemies in a form known as &quot;mokomokai.&quot; They removed the brain and eyes, and smoked the head, preserving the moko tattoos. The heads were sold to European collectors in the late 1800s, in some instances having been commissioned and &quot;made to order&quot;.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, headhunting was extensive among the various Cordilleran peoples (also known as &quot;Igorot&quot;) of the Luzon highlands. It was tied with rites of passage, rice harvests, religious rituals to ancestor spirits, blood feuds, and indigenous tattooing. Cordilleran tribes used specific weapons for beheading enemies in raids and warfare, specifically the uniquely shaped head axes and various swords and knives. Though some Cordilleran tribes living near Christianized lowlanders during the Spanish colonial period had already abandoned the practice by the 19th century, they were still rampant in more remote areas beyond the reach of Spanish colonial authorities. The practices were finally suppressed in the early 20th century by the United States during the American colonial period of the Philippines.

===Taiwan===

Headhunting was a common practice among Taiwanese aborigines. All tribes practiced headhunting except the Yami people, who were previously isolated on Orchid Island, and the Ivatan people. It was associated with the peoples of the Philippines.

Taiwanese Plains Aborigines, Han Taiwanese and Japanese settlers were choice victims of headhunting raids by Taiwanese Mountain Aborigines. The latter two groups were considered invaders, liars, and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields, or set a dwelling on fire and then kill and behead those who fled from the burning structure. The practice continued during the Japanese rule of Taiwan, but ended in the 1930s due to brutal suppression by the Japanese colonial government.
The Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes, who were allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652, turned against the Dutch in turn during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia. They defected to Koxinga&#x27;s Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty. The Sincan Aboriginals fought for the Chinese and beheaded Dutch people in executions. The frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on May 17, 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under Dutch rule. They hunted down Dutch people, beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.

At the Battle of Tamsui in the Keelung Campaign during the Sino-French War on 8 October 1884, the Chinese took prisoners and beheaded 11 French marines who were injured, in addition to &quot;La Galissonnière&#x27;s&quot; captain Fontaine. The heads were mounted on bamboo poles and displayed to incite anti-French feelings. In China, pictures of the beheading of the Frenchmen were published in the &quot;Tien-shih-tsai Pictorial Journal&quot; in Shanghai.

Han Taiwanese and Taiwanese Aboriginals revolted against the Japanese in the Beipu Uprising in 1907 and Tapani Incident in 1915. The Seediq aboriginals revolted against the Japanese in the 1930 Musha Incident and resurrected the practice of headhunting, beheading Japanese during the revolt.

==Mainland Asia==
===China===
During the Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period, Qin soldiers frequently collected their defeated enemies&#x27; heads as a means to accumulate merits. After Shang Yang&#x27;s reforms, the Qin armies adopted a meritocracy system that awards the average soldiers, most of whom were conscripted serfs and were not paid, an opportunity to earn promotions and rewards from their superiors by collecting the heads of enemies, a type of body count. In this area, authorities also displayed heads of executed criminals in public spaces up to the early 20th century.

The Wa people, a mountain ethnic minority in Southwest China, eastern Myanmar (Shan State) and northern Thailand, were once known as the &quot;Wild Wa&quot; by British colonists due to their traditional practice of headhunting.

===Japan===
Tom O&#x27;Neill wrote: 
Samurai also sought glory by headhunting. When a battle ended, the warrior, true to his mercenary origins, would ceremoniously present trophy heads to a general, who would variously reward him with promotions in rank, gold or silver, or land from the defeated clan. Generals displayed the heads of defeated rivals in public squares.

===Indian subcontinent and Indochina===
Headhunting has been a practice among the Kukis, the Wa, Mizo, the Garo and the Naga ethnic groups of India, Bangladesh and Myanmar till the 19th century. Nuristanis in eastern Afghanistan were headhunters until the late 19th century.

The Wa people, whose domain straddles the Burma-China border, were once known to Europeans as the &quot;Wild Wa&quot; for their &quot;savage&quot; behavior. Until the 1970s, the Wa practiced headhunting.

==Americas==

===Amazon===
Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, including the Shuar in Eastern Ecuador and Northern Peru, along the rivers Chinchipe, Bobonaza, Morona, Upano, and Pastaza, main tributaries of the Amazon, practiced headhunting for trophies. The heads were shrunk, and were known locally as &quot;Tzan-Tzas&quot;. The people believed that the head housed the soul of the person killed.

In the 21st century, the Shuar produce Tzan-tza replicas. They use their traditional process on heads of monkeys and sloths, selling the items to tourists. It is believed that splinter groups in the local tribes continue with these practices when there is a tribal feud over territory or as revenge for a crime of passion. 

The Kichwa-Lamista people in Peru used to be headhunters.

===Mesoamerican civilizations===
A &quot;tzompantli&quot; is a type of wooden rack or palisade documented in several Mesoamerican civilizations. It was used for the public display of human skulls, typically those of war captives or other sacrificial victims.

A tzompantli-type structure has been excavated at the La Coyotera, Oaxaca site. It is dated to the Proto-Classic Zapotec civilization, which flourished from c. 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE. &quot;Tzompantli&quot; are also noted in other Mesoamerican pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Toltec and Mixtec.

Based on numbers given by the conquistador Andrés de Tapia and Fray Diego Durán, Bernard Ortiz de Montellano has calculated in the late 20th century that there were at most 60,000 skulls on the &quot;Hueyi Tzompantli&quot; (great Skullrack) of Tenochtitlan. There were at least five more skullracks in Tenochtitlan, but, by all accounts, they were much smaller.

Other examples are indicated from Maya civilization sites. A particularly fine and intact inscription example survives at the extensive Chichen Itza site.

===Nazca culture===
The Nazca used severed heads, known as trophy heads, in various religious rituals. Late Nazca iconography suggests that the prestige of the leaders of Late Nazca society was enhanced by successful headhunting.

==Europe==
===Celts===
The Celts of Europe practiced headhunting as the head was believed to house a person&#x27;s soul. Ancient Romans and Greeks recorded the Celts&#x27; habits of nailing heads of personal enemies to walls or dangling them from the necks of horses. The Celtic Gaels practiced headhunting a great deal longer. In the &quot;Ulster Cycle&quot; of Irish mythology, the demigod Cúchulainn beheads the three sons of Nechtan and mounting their heads on his chariot. This is believed to have been a traditional warrior, rather than religious, practice. The practice continued approximately to the end of the Middle Ages among the Irish clans and even later among the Border Reivers of the Anglo-Scottish marches. The pagan religious reasons for headhunting were likely lost after the Celts&#x27; conversion to Christianity, even though the practice continued.
In former Celtic areas, cephalophore representations of saints (miraculously carrying their severed heads) were common.
Heads were also taken among the Germanic tribes and among Iberians, but the purpose is unknown.

===Montenegrins===

The Montenegrins are an ethnic group in Southeastern Europe who are centered around the Dinaric mountains and are extremely closely related to Serbs. They practiced headhunting until 1876, allegedly carrying the head from a lock of hair grown specifically for that purpose.
In the 1830s, Montenegrin ruler Petar II Petrović-Njegoš started building a tower called &quot;Tablja&quot; above Cetinje Monastery. The tower was never finished, and Montenegrins used it to display Turkish heads taken in battle, as they were in frequent conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In 1876 King Nicholas I of Montenegro ordered that the practice should end. He knew that European diplomats considered it to be barbaric. The &quot;Tablja&quot; was demolished in 1937.

===Scythians===
The Scythians were excellent horsemen. Ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that some of their tribes practiced human sacrifice, drinking the blood of victims, scalping their enemies, and drinking wine from the enemies&#x27; skulls.

==Modern times==
===Second Sino-Japanese War===

====Nanjing Massacre====
Many Chinese soldiers and civilians were beheaded by some Japanese soldiers, who even made contests to see who would kill more people &quot;(see Hundred man killing contest)&quot;, and took photos with the piles of heads as souvenirs.

===World War II===
During World War II, Allied (specifically including American) troops occasionally collected the skulls of dead Japanese as personal trophies, as souvenirs for friends and family at home, and for sale to others. (The practice was unique to the Pacific theater; United States forces did not take skulls of German and Italian soldiers.) In September 1942, the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet mandated strong disciplinary action against any soldier who took enemy body parts as souvenirs. But such trophy-hunting persisted: &quot;Life&quot; published a photograph in its issue of May 22, 1944, of a young woman posing with the autographed skull sent to her by her Navy boyfriend. There was public outrage in the US in response.

Historians have suggested that the practice related to Americans viewing the Japanese as lesser people, and in response to mutilation and torture of American war dead. In Borneo, retaliation by natives against the Japanese was based on atrocities having been committed by the Imperial Japanese Army in that area. Following their ill treatment by the Japanese, the Dayak of Borneo formed a force to help the Allies. Australian and British special operatives of Z Special Unit developed some of the inland Dayak tribesmen into a thousand-strong headhunting army. This army of tribesmen killed or captured some 1,500 Japanese soldiers.
===Malayan Emergency===
During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), British and Commonwealth forces recruited Iban (Dayak) headhunters from Borneo to fight and decapitate suspected guerrillas of the socialist and pro-independence Malayan National Liberation Army, officially claiming this was done for &quot;identification&quot; purposes. Iban headhunters were permitted to keep the scalps of corpses as trophies. Privately, the Colonial Office noted that &quot;there is no doubt that under international law a similar case in wartime would be a war crime&quot;. Skull fragments from a trophy skull was later found to have been displayed in a British regimental museum. 

In April 1952, the British Communist Party&#x27;s official newspaper the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; (today known as the &quot;Morning Star&quot;) published a photograph of Royal Marines in a British military base in Malaya openly posing with severed human heads. Initially, British government spokespersons belonging to the Admiralty and the Colonial Office denied the newspaper&#x27;s claims and insisted that the photograph was a forgery. In response, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; released yet another photograph taken in Malaya showing other British soldiers posing with a severed human head. In response, Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton was forced to admit before the House of Commons that the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; headhunting photographs were indeed genuine. In response to the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; articles, headhunting was banned by Winston Churchill, who feared that further photographs would continue being exploited for communist propaganda.

Despite the shocking imagery of the photographs of soldiers posing with severed heads in Malaya, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was the only British newspaper to publish them during the 20th century, and the photographs were virtually ignored by the mainstream British press.

===Vietnam War===
During the Vietnam War, some American soldiers engaged in the practice of taking &quot;trophy skulls&quot;.

<text>Giovanni Pisano () was an Italian sculptor, painter and architect, who worked in the cities of Pisa, Siena and Pistoia. He is best known for his sculpture which shows the influence of both the French Gothic and the Ancient Roman art. Henry Moore, referring to his statues for the facade of Siena Cathedral, called him &quot;the first modern sculptor&quot;.

==History== 
Born in Pisa, Giovanni Pisano was the son of the famous sculptor Nicola Pisano. He received his training in the workshop of his father and in 1265–1268 he worked with his father on the pulpit in Siena Cathedral. His next major work with his father was the fountain &quot;Fontana Maggiore&quot; in Perugia (completed 1278). Nicola Pisano is thought to have died either around 1278 or in 1284 when Giovanni took up residence in Siena. These first works were made in Nicola&#x27;s style and it is difficult to separate the contributions of the two artists. However, the &quot;Madonna with Child&quot; can be attributed with certainty to Giovanni, showing a new style with a certain familiarity between Mother and Child.

Giovanni&#x27;s next work was at Pisa Cathedral, sculpting the statues in the two rows of traceried gables at the exterior of the Baptistry (1277–1284). The vivacity of these statues is a new confirmation that he had left the serene style of his father behind. Between 1287 and 1296 he was appointed chief architect of Siena Cathedral. The architectural design and elegant sculptures for the facade of the cathedral in Siena show his tendency to blend Gothic art with reminders of Roman art. The work was continued after his death, with still greater Gothic elaboration, by Memmo di Filippuccio.

In 1296 he returned to Pisa to begin work on the Church of San Giovanni. In 1301 he continued his work on the Pulpit of Sant&#x27; Andrea, Pistoia which he had already started in 1297. The pulpit has five reliefs: the Annunciation and Nativity; the Adoration, the Dream of the Magi and the Angel warning Joseph; the Massacre of the Innocents; the Crucifixion; and the Last Judgement.

Giovanni&#x27;s work between 1302 and 1310 at the new pulpit for the Cathedral of Pisa shows his distinct preference for animation in his characters and moved his father&#x27;s style even further away. This pulpit with its dramatic scenes has become his masterwork. It shows nine scenes from the New Testament, carved in white marble with a chiaroscuro effect. It contains even a bold, naturalistic depiction of a naked Hercules. His figure &quot;Prudence&quot; in the pulpit may have been an inspiration for the &quot;Eve&quot; in the painting &quot;The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden&quot; by Masaccio. After the fire of 1595, it was packed away during the redecoration and was not rediscovered and re-erected until 1926.

The church of San Nicola in Pisa was enlarged between 1297 and 1313 by the Augustinians, perhaps by the design of Giovanni Pisano. He was also responsible for the façade of San Paolo a Ripa d&#x27;Arno. His last major work dates probably from 1313 when he made a monument in memory of Margaret of Brabant (who died in 1311) at the request of her husband emperor Henry VII.

==Legacy==
One of his pupils was Giovanni di Balduccio, who also became a famous sculptor, and the architect and sculptor Agostino da Siena. He also had an influence on the painter Pietro Lorenzetti. Giorgio Vasari included a biography of Pisano in his book &quot;Le vite dei più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architetti&quot;.

The asteroid &quot;7313 Pisano&quot; was named to honour Nicola and Giovanni Pisano.

<doc id="237504" wikidata="Q1071027" url="?curid=237504" title="Personal name">
<text>A personal name, full name or prosoponym (from Ancient Greek &quot;prósōpon&quot; – person, and &quot;onoma&quot; –name) is the set of names by which an individual person or animal is known. When taken together as a word-group, they all relate to that one individual. In many cultures, the term is synonymous with the &quot;birth name&quot; or &quot;legal name&quot; of the individual. In linguistic classification, personal names are studied within a specific onomastic discipline, called anthroponymy. As of 2023, aside from humans, dolphins and elephants have been known to use personal names.

In Western culture, nearly all individuals possess at least one &quot;given name&quot; (also known as a &quot;first name&quot;, &quot;forename&quot;, or &quot;Christian name&quot;), together with a &quot;surname&quot; (also known as a &quot;last name&quot; or &quot;family name&quot;). In the name &quot;James Smith&quot;, for example, &quot;James&quot; is the first name and &quot;Smith&quot; is the surname. Surnames in the West generally indicate that the individual belongs to a family, a tribe, or a clan, although the exact relationships vary: they may be given at birth, taken upon adoption, changed upon marriage, and so on. Where there are two or more given names, typically only one (in English-speaking cultures usually the first) is used in normal speech.

Another naming convention that is used mainly in the Arabic culture and in different other areas across Africa and Asia is connecting the person&#x27;s given name with a chain of names, starting with the name of the person&#x27;s father and then the father&#x27;s father and so on, usually ending with the family name (tribe or clan name). However, the legal full name of a person usually contains the first three names (given name, father&#x27;s name, father&#x27;s father&#x27;s name) and the family name at the end, to limit the name in government-issued ID. Men&#x27;s names and women&#x27;s names are constructed using the same convention, and a person&#x27;s name is not altered if they are married.

Some cultures, including Western ones, also add (or once added) patronymics or matronymics, for instance as a middle name as with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (whose father&#x27;s given name was Ilya), or as a last name as with Björk Guðmundsdóttir (whose father is named Guðmundur) or Heiðar Helguson (whose mother was named Helga). Similar concepts are present in Eastern cultures. However, in some areas of the world, many people are known by a single name, and so are said to be mononymous. Still other cultures lack the concept of specific, fixed names designating people, either individually or collectively. Certain isolated tribes, such as the Machiguenga of the Amazon, do not use personal names.

A person&#x27;s personal name is usually their full legal name; however, some people use only part of their full legal name, a title, nickname, pseudonym or other chosen name that is different from their legal name, and reserve their legal name for legal and administrative purposes.

It is nearly universal for people to have names; the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child declares that a child has the right to a name from birth.

==Structure in humans==

Common components of names given at birth can include:
* Personal name: The given name (or acquired name in some cultures) can precede a family name (as in most European cultures), or it can come after the family name (as in some East Asian cultures and Hungary), or be used without a family name.
* Patronymic: A surname based on the given name of the father.
* Matronymic: A surname based on the given name of the mother.
* Family name: A name used by all members of a family. In China, surnames gradually came into common use beginning in the 3rd century BC (having been common only among the nobility before that). In some areas of East Asia (e.g. Korea and Vietnam), surnames developed in the next several centuries, while in other areas (like Japan), surnames did not become prevalent until the 19th century. In Europe, after the loss of the Roman system, the common use of family names started quite early in some areas (France in the 13th century, and Germany in the 16th century), but it often did not happen until much later in areas that used a patronymic naming custom, such as the Scandinavian countries, Wales, and some areas of Germany, as well as Russia and Ukraine. The compulsory use of surnames varied greatly. France required a priest to write surnames in baptismal records in 1539 (but did not require surnames for Jews, who usually used patronymics, until 1808). On the other hand, surnames were not compulsory in the Scandinavian countries until the 19th or 20th century (1923 in Norway), and Iceland still does not use surnames for its native inhabitants. In most of the cultures of the Middle East and South Asia, surnames were not generally used until European influence took hold in the 19th century.

In Spain and most Latin American countries, two surnames are used, one being the father&#x27;s family name and the other being the mother&#x27;s family name. In Spain, the second surname is sometimes informally used alone if the first one is too common to allow an easy identification. For example, former Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero is often called just &quot;Zapatero&quot;. In Argentina, only the father&#x27;s last name is used, in most cases.

In most Portuguese-speaking countries typically two surnames are used, sometimes three or four, typically some or none inherited from the mother and some or all inherited from the father, in that order. Co-parental siblings most often share an identical string of surnames. For collation, shortening, and formal addressing, the last of these surnames is typically preferred. A Portuguese person named António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres would therefore be known commonly as António Guterres.

In Russia, the first name and family name conform to the usual Western practice, but the middle name is patronymic. Thus, all the children of Ivan Volkov would be named &quot;[first name] Ivanovich Volkov&quot; if male, or &quot;[first name] Ivanovna Volkova&quot; if female (-ovich meaning &quot;son of&quot;, -ovna meaning &quot;daughter of&quot;, and -a usually being appended to the surnames of girls). However, in formal Russian name order, the surname comes first, followed by the given name and patronymic, such as &quot;Raskolnikov Rodion Romanovich&quot;.

In many families, single or multiple middle names are simply alternative names, names honoring an ancestor or relative, or, for married women, sometimes their maiden names. In some traditions, however, the roles of the first and middle given names are reversed, with the first given name being used to honor a family member and the middle name being used as the usual method to address someone informally. Many Catholic families choose a saint&#x27;s name as their child&#x27;s middle name or this can be left until the child&#x27;s confirmation when they choose a saint&#x27;s name for themselves. Cultures that use patronymics or matronymics will often give middle names to distinguish between two similarly named people: e.g., Einar Karl Stefánsson and Einar Guðmundur Stefánsson. This is especially done in Iceland (as shown in example) where people are known and referred to almost exclusively by their given name/s.

Some people (called &quot;anonyms&quot;) choose to be anonymous, that is, to hide their true names, for fear of governmental prosecution or social ridicule of their works or actions. Another method to disguise one&#x27;s identity is to employ a pseudonym.

For some people, their name is a single word, known as a mononym. This can be true from birth, or occur later in life. For example, Teller, of the magician duo Penn and Teller, was named Raymond Joseph Teller at birth, but changed his name both legally and socially to be simply &quot;Teller&quot;. In some official government documents, such as his driver&#x27;s license, his given name is listed as &quot;NFN&quot;, an initialism for &quot;no first name&quot;.

The Inuit believe that the souls of the namesakes are one, so they traditionally refer to the junior namesakes, not just by the names (&quot;atiq&quot;), but also by kinship title, which applies across gender and generation without implications of disrespect or seniority.

In Judaism, someone&#x27;s name is considered intimately connected with their fate, and adding a name (e.g. on the sickbed) may avert a particular danger. Among Ashkenazi Jews it is also considered bad luck to take the name of a living ancestor, as the Angel of Death may mistake the younger person for their namesake (although there is no such custom among Sephardi Jews). Jews may also have a Jewish name for intra-community use and use a different name when engaging with the Gentile world.

Chinese and Japanese emperors receive posthumous names.

In some Polynesian cultures, the name of a deceased chief becomes taboo. If he is named after a common object or concept, a different word has to be used for it.

In Cameroon, there is &quot;a great deal of mobility&quot; within naming structure. Some Cameroonians, particularly Anglophone Cameroonians, use &quot;a characteristic sequencing&quot; starting with a first surname, followed by a forename then a second surname (e.g. Awanto Josephine Nchang), while others begin with a forename followed by first and then second surnames (e.g. Josephine Awanto Nchang). The latter structure is rare in Francophone Cameroon, however, where a third structure prevails: First surname, second surname, forename (e.g. Awanto Nchang Josephine).

Depending on national convention, additional given names (and sometimes titles) are considered part of the name.

==Feudal names==
The royalty, nobility, and gentry of Europe traditionally have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed the method of putting the term by which the person is referred in small capital letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of Eastern Asia, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who is known as the Marquis de La Fayette. He possessed both the lands of Motier and La Fayette.

The bare place name was used formerly to refer to the person who owned it, rather than the land itself (the word &quot;Gloucester&quot; in &quot;What will Gloucester do?&quot; meant the Duke of Gloucester). As a development, the bare name of a ship in the Royal Navy meant its captain (e.g., &quot;Cressy didn&#x27;t learn from Aboukir&quot;) while the name with an article referred to the ship (e.g., &quot;The &quot;Cressy&quot; is foundering&quot;).

==Naming conventions==
A personal naming system, or anthroponymic system, is a system describing the choice of personal name in a certain society. Personal names consist of one or more parts, such as given name, surname and patronymic. Personal naming systems are studied within the field of anthroponymy.

In contemporary Western societies (except for Iceland, Hungary, and sometimes Flanders, depending on the occasion), the most common naming convention is that a person must have a given name, which is usually gender-specific, followed by the parents&#x27; family name. In onomastic terminology, given names of male persons are called &quot;andronyms&quot; (from Ancient Greek ἀνήρ / man, and ὄνομα / name), while given names of female persons are called &quot;gynonyms&quot; (from Ancient Greek γυνή / woman, and ὄνομα / name).

Some given names are bespoke, but most are repeated from earlier generations in the same culture. Many are drawn from mythology, some of which span multiple language areas. This has resulted in related names in different languages (e.g. George, Georg, Jorge), which might be translated or might be maintained as immutable proper nouns.

In earlier times, Scandinavian countries followed patronymic naming, with people effectively called &quot;X&#x27;s son/daughter&quot;; this is now the case only in Iceland and was recently re-introduced as an option in the Faroe Islands. It is legally possible in Finland as people of Icelandic ethnic naming are specifically named in the name law. When people of this name convert to standards of other cultures, the phrase is often condensed into one word, creating last names like Jacobsen (Jacob&#x27;s Son).

There is a range of personal naming systems:

* Binomial systems: apart from their given name, people are described by their surnames, which they obtain from one of their parents. Most modern European personal naming systems are of this type.
* Patronymic systems: apart from their given name, people are described by their patronymics, that is, given names (not surnames) of parents or other ancestors. Such systems were in wide use throughout Europe in the first millennium CE, but were replaced by binomial systems. The Icelandic system is still patronymic.
* More complex systems like Arabic system, consisting of paedonymic (son&#x27;s name), given name, patronymic and one or two bynames.

Different cultures have different conventions for personal names.

=== English-speaking countries ===
==== Generational designation ====
When names are repeated across generations, the senior or junior generation (or both) may be designed with the name suffix &quot;Sr.&quot; or &quot;Jr.&quot;, respectively (in the former case, retrospectively); or, more formally, by an ordinal Roman number such as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; or &quot;III&quot;. In the Catholic tradition, papal names are distinguished in sequence, and may be reused many times, such as John XXIII (the 23rd pope assuming the papal name &quot;John&quot;).

In the case of the American presidents George H. W. Bush and his son George W. Bush, distinct middle initials serve this purpose instead, necessitating their more frequent use. The improvised and unofficial &quot;Bush Sr.&quot; and &quot;Bush Jr.&quot; were nevertheless tossed about in banter on many entertainment journalism opinion panels; alternatively, they became distinguished merely as &quot;W.&quot; and &quot;H. W.&quot;.

==== Rank, title, honour, accreditation, and affiliation ====
In formal address, personal names may be preceded by pre-nominal letters, giving title (e.g. Dr., Captain), or social rank, which is commonly gendered (e.g. Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss.) and might additionally convey marital status. Historically, professional titles such as &quot;Doctor&quot; and &quot;Reverend&quot; were largely confined to male professions, so these were implicitly gendered.

In formal address, personal names, inclusive of a generational designation, if any, may be followed by one or more post-nominal letters giving office, honour, decoration, accreditation, or formal affiliation.

== Name order ==


===Western name order===

The order &quot;given name(s), family name&quot; is commonly known as the Western name order and is usually used in Western European countries and in non-Western European countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe (e.g. the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand). It is also used in non-Western regions such as Northern, Eastern, Central and Western India; Pakistan; Bangladesh; Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand; Saudi Arabia; Indonesia (non-traditional); Singapore; Malaysia (most of, non-traditional); and the Philippines.

Within alphabetic lists and catalogs, however, the family name is generally put first, with the given name(s) following and separated by a comma (e.g. Jobs, Steve), representing the &quot;lexical name order&quot;. This convention is followed by most Western libraries, as well as on many administrative forms. In some countries, such as France, or countries previously part of the former Soviet Union, the comma may be dropped and the swapped form of the name be uttered as such, perceived as a mark of bureaucratic formality. In the USSR and now Russia, personal initials are often written in the &quot;family name - given name - patronymic name&quot; order when signing official documents (), e.g. &quot;Rachmaninoff S.V.&quot;.

===Eastern name order===
The order &quot;family name, given name&quot;, commonly known as the Eastern name order, began to be prominently used in Ancient China and subsequently influenced the East Asian cultural sphere (China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam) and particularly among the Chinese communities in Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, or the Philippines. It is also used in the southern and northeastern parts of India, as well as in Central Europe by Hungary and Romania, along with the South Estonians and Mordvins of the former Soviet Union. In Uganda, the ordering &quot;traditional family name first, Western origin given name second&quot; is also frequently used.

When East Asian names are transliterated into the Latin alphabet, some people prefer to convert them to the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in capital letters. To avoid confusion, there is a convention in some language communities, e.g., French, that the family name should be written in all capitals when engaging in formal correspondence or writing for an international audience. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept, and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. &quot;Mijazaki Hajao&quot; in Hungarian), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki). This is also true for Hungarian names in Japanese, e.g. Ferenc Puskás (, written in the same Eastern order &quot;Puskás Ferenc&quot;).

Starting from the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Western name order was primarily used among the Japanese nobility when identifying themselves to non-Asians with their romanized names. As a result, in popular Western publications, this order became increasingly used for Japanese names in the subsequent decades. In 2020, the Government of Japan reverted the Westernized name order back to the Eastern name order in official documents (e.g. identity documents, academic certificates, birth certificates, marriage certificates, among others), which means writing family name first in capital letters and has recommended that the same format be used among the general Japanese public.

Japan has also requested Western publications to respect this change, such as not using Shinzo Abe but rather Abe Shinzo, similar to how Chinese leader Xi Jinping is not referred to as Jinping Xi. Its sluggish response by Western publications was met with ire by Japanese politician Taro Kono, who stated that &quot;If you can write Moon Jae-in and Xi Jinping in correct order, you can surely write Abe Shinzo the same way.&quot;

====East Asia====
Chinese, Koreans, and other East Asian peoples, except for those traveling or living outside of China and areas influenced by China, rarely reverse their Chinese and Korean language names to the Western naming order. Western publications also preserve this Eastern naming order for Chinese, Korean and other East Asian individuals, with the family name first, followed by the given name.

=====Chinese=====
In China, Cantonese names of Hong Kong people are usually written in the Eastern order with or without a comma (e.g. Bai Chiu En or Bai, Chiu En). Outside Hong Kong, they are usually written in Western order. Unlike other East Asian countries, the syllables or logograms of given names are not hyphenated or compounded but instead separated by a space (e.g. Chiu En). Outside East Asia, the second syllables are often confused with middle names regardless of name order. Some computer systems could not handle given name inputs with space characters.

Some Chinese, Malaysians and Singaporeans may have an anglicised given name, which is always written in the Western order. The English and transliterated Chinese full names can be written in various orders. A hybrid order is preferred in official documents including the legislative records in the case for Hong Kong.

Examples of the hybrid order goes in the form of Hong Kong actor “Tony Leung Chiu-wai” or Singapore Prime Minister &quot;Lawrence Wong Shyun Tsai&quot;, with family names (in the example, Leung and Wong) shared in the middle. Therefore, the anglicised names are written in the Western order (Tony Leung, Lawrence Wong) and the Chinese names are written in the Eastern order (Leung Chiu-wai, 梁朝偉; Wong Shyun Tsai, 黄循财).

=====Japanese=====
Japanese use the Eastern naming order (family name followed by given name). In contrast to China and Korea, due to familiarity, Japanese names of contemporary people are usually &quot;switched&quot; when people who have such names are mentioned in media in Western countries; for example, &quot;Koizumi Jun&#x27;ichirō&quot; is known as Junichiro Koizumi in English. Japan has requested that Western publications cease this practice of placing their names in the Western name order and revert to the Eastern name order.

=====Mongolian=====
Mongols use the Eastern naming order (patronymic followed by given name), which is also used there when rendering the names of other East Asians. However, Russian and other Western names (with the exception of Hungarian names) are still written in Western order.

====South India====
=====Telugu=====
Telugu people from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana traditionally use &quot;family name, given name&quot; order. The family name first format is different from North India where family name typically appears last or other parts of South India where patronymic names are widely used instead of family names.

=====Tamil=====

Tamil people, generally those of younger generations, do not employ caste names as surnames. This came into common use in India and also the Tamil diaspora in nations like Singapore after the Dravidian movement in 1930s, when the Self respect movement in the 1950s and 1960s campaigned against the use of one&#x27;s caste as part of the name. Patronymic naming system is: apart from their given name, people are described by their patronymic, that is given names (not surnames) of their father. Older generations used the initials system where the father&#x27;s given name appears as an initial, for eg: Tamil Hindu people&#x27;s names simply use initials as a prefix instead of Patronymic suffix (father&#x27;s given name) and the initials is/ are prefixed or listed first and then followed by the son&#x27;s/ daughter&#x27;s given name.
One system used for naming, using only given names (without using family name or surname) is as below: for Tamil Hindu son&#x27;s name using the initials system: S. Rajeev: (initial S for father&#x27;s given name Suresh and Rajeev is the son&#x27;s given name). The same Tamil Hindu name using Patronymic suffix last name system is Rajeev Suresh meaning Rajeev son of Suresh (Rajeev (first is son&#x27;s given name) followed by Suresh (father&#x27;s given name)). As a result, unlike surnames, while using patronymic suffix the same last name will not pass down through many generations. For Tamil Hindu daughters, the initials naming system is the same, eg: S. Meena. Using the Patronymic suffix system it is Meena Suresh: meaning Meena daughter of Suresh; Meena (first is daughter&#x27;s given name) followed by Suresh (father&#x27;s given name). As a result, unlike surnames, while using patronymic suffix the same last name will not pass down through many generations. And after marriage the wife may or may not take her husband&#x27;s given name as her last name instead of her father&#x27;s. Eg: after marriage, Meena Jagadish: meaning Meena wife of Jagadish: Meena (first is wife&#x27;s given name) followed by Jagadish (husband&#x27;s given name).

====Hungary====

Hungary is one of the few Western countries to use the Eastern naming order where the given name is placed after the family name.

====Mordvin====
Mordvins use two names – a Mordvin name and a Russian name. The Mordvin name is written in the Eastern name order. Usually, the Mordvin surname is the same as the Russian surname, for example Sharononj Sandra (Russian: Aleksandr Sharonov), but it can be different at times, for example Yovlan Olo (Russian: Vladimir Romashkin).

====Romania====

In official documents as well as in verbal speech, the Family name comes in first before the Given name when the full name is spelled out.

====South Estonian====
In South Estonian the names are written in the Eastern name order.

==Non-human personal names==
===Animal names for each other===
In a 2006 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington studying bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, found that the dolphins had names for each other. A dolphin chooses its name as an infant.

According to a 2024 article of a study of elephant calls in Amboseli National Park, Kenya and Samburu National Reserve and Buffalo Springs National Reserves between 1986 and 2022 done with machine learning, elephants learn, recognize and use individualized name-like calls.

===Names of pets===

The practice of naming pets dates back at least to the 23rd century BC. An Egyptian inscription from that period mentions a dog named Abuwtiyuw.

Many pet owners give human names to their pets. This has been shown to reflect the owner having a human-like relationship with the pet. The name given to a pet may refer to its appearance or personality, or be chosen for endearment, or in honor of a favorite celebrity. Pet names often reflect the owner&#x27;s view of the animal, and the expectations they may have for it.

Dog breeders often choose specific themes for their names, sometimes based on the number of the litter. In some countries, like Germany or Austria, names are chosen alphabetically, with names starting with &#x27;A&#x27; for puppies from the first litter, &#x27;B&#x27; for the second litter, and so on. A puppy called &quot;Dagmar&quot; would belong to a fourth litter. Dog owners can choose to keep the original name, or rename their pet.

It has been argued that the giving of names to their pets allows researchers to view their pets as ontologically different from unnamed laboratory animals with which they work.

<doc id="237505" wikidata="Q905716" url="?curid=237505" title="Coracoid process">
<text>The coracoid [[Process (anatomy)|process]] (from Greek κόραξ, raven) is a small hook-like structure on the lateral edge of the superior anterior portion of the scapula (hence: coracoid, or &quot;like a raven&#x27;s beak&quot;). Pointing laterally forward, it, together with the acromion, serves to stabilize the shoulder joint. It is palpable in the deltopectoral groove between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles.

==Structure==

The coracoid process is a thick curved process attached by a broad base to the upper part of the neck of the scapula; it runs at first upward and medially; then, becoming smaller, it changes its direction, and projects forward and laterally.

The component parts of the process are the base; angle; shaft; and apex of the coracoid process, respectively. The coracoglenoid notch is an indentation localized between the coracoid process and the glenoid. As the coracoid process projects laterally, it defines the subcoracoid space beneath.

The &quot;ascending portion&quot;, flattened from the frontal aspect backward, presents in front a smooth concave surface, across which the subscapularis passes.

The &quot;horizontal portion&quot; appears flattened when viewed from above looking downward; its upper surface is convex and irregular, and gives attachment to the pectoralis minor; its under surface is smooth; its medial and lateral borders are rough; the former gives attachment to the pectoralis minor and the latter to the coracoacromial ligament; the apex is embraced by the Conjoint tendon of origin of the coracobrachialis and short head of the biceps brachii and gives attachment to the coracoclavicular fascia.

On the medial part of the root of the coracoid process is a rough impression for the attachment of the conoid ligament; and running from it obliquely forward and laterally, on to the upper surface of the horizontal portion, is an elevated ridge for the attachment of the trapezoid ligament.

The coracoid process is a snare molded bone design projecting anterolaterally from the unrivaled(?) part of the scapular neck. Surgeons refer to this part of the body as the “lighthouse of the shoulder” as it is close to the area where structures of veins and nerves (neurovascular) are bound together. The distances between the coracoid base and the neurovascular structures is like a 90 degree chair. The suprascapular ligament is right next to the coracoid process. The muscles that are attached are: Pectoralis Minor, Coracobrachialis, and Biceps Brachii.

In addition, this structure attaches all the tendons and ligaments together.  There are two purposes for this structure: it is the primary hold by which the clavicle is joined to the scapula and alongside the acromion and coraco-acromial tendon, it shapes the curve over the glenoid. By having the coracoid process, this allows the scapula to not be attached to the skeletons by the bone so that it can only support the limbs. Although there are minor instances where the coracoid process can be damaged by itself, there can still be damage to the structure with an acute subscapularis tear. Usually a disruption in the coracoid process can indicate a shoulder injury such as dislocation and instability.

=== Attachments ===
It is the site of attachment for several structures:

==== Muscles ====
* The pectoralis minor muscle (insertion) – to 3rd, 4th, 5th and on some rare occasions, 6th rib.
* The short head of biceps brachii muscle (origin) – to radial tuberosity.
* The coracobrachialis muscle (origin) – to medial humerus.

==== Ligaments ====
* The coracoclavicular ligament – to the clavicle. (The ligament is formed by the conoid ligament and trapezoid ligament.)
* The coracoacromial ligament – to the acromion
* The coracohumeral ligament – to the humerus
* The superior transverse scapular ligament – from the base of the coracoid to the medial portion of the suprascapular notch

==Clinical significance==
The coracoid process is palpable just below the lateral end of the clavicle (collar bone). It is otherwise known as the &quot;Surgeon&#x27;s Lighthouse&quot; because it serves as a landmark to avoid neurovascular damage.
Major neurovascular structures enter the upper limb medial to the coracoid process, so that surgical approaches to the shoulder region should always take place laterally to the coracoid process.

==Other animals==
In monotremes, the coracoid is a separate bone. Reptiles, birds, and frogs (but not salamanders) also possess a bone by this name, but is not homologous with the coracoid process of mammals.

Analyses of the size and shape of the coracoid process in &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; (STS 7) have shown that, in this species, it displayed a prominent dorsolateral tubercle placed more laterally than in modern humans. This may reflect, according to one interpretation, a scapula positioned high on a funnel-shaped thorax with an obliquely-positioned clavicle, as in extant non-human great apes.
Anthropologists examine the coracoid process when studying shoulder morphology to determine whether the upper limbs provided support for bipedalism in the early hominin ages.  The shoulder is an area of primate life structures that previous examinations have demonstrated to emphatically mirror the varying useful requests forced by contrasts in locomotor modes. Since the morphology of early hominin upper appendage components comprises a blend of derived traits, it is noted that these primitive features are of continuous usage throughout the evolution of hominins. When &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; (known as Sts 7 within the realms of Anthropology) was being examined, it was observed that the scapular orientation was higher as compared to modern day humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;). However, Homo Sapiens do not have distinct features in terms of shape or size when it comes to the coracoid process. Within the research of Elizabeth Vrbua, a paleoanthropologist who made a study called “A New Study of the Scapula of Australopithecus africanus from Sterkfontein”, it was seen that &quot;A. africanus&quot; had a higher scapular position which could infer that this position is likely to be seen in earlier hominins as well.

According to the authors of “The human acromion viewed from an evolutionary perspective”, there were different shapes of surface of the coracoid process within the various hominins. The gorillas had a wide shape, chimpanzees, orangutans and humans had an intermediate shape, and the gibbon had a small shape. This can further be analyzed as the different hominids have variability in their shape of the coracoid process.  The latest contributions to the evolutionary coracoid process were from Doctor M. Hussan in 2016 where he added further insight on the significance of the subacromial impingement and coracoacromial arch&#x27;s importance with the aid of pathology.

<doc id="237515" wikidata="Q297783" url="?curid=237515" title="Appius Claudius Caecus">
<text>Appius Claudius Caecus ( 312–279 BC) was a statesman and writer from the Roman Republic. He is best known for two major building projects: the Appian Way (Latin: Via Appia), the first major Roman road, and the first aqueduct in Rome, the Aqua Appia.

He is the first Roman public figure whose life can be traced with some historical certainty. He also instigated controversial popular-minded reforms and is also credited with the authorship of a juristic treatise, a collection of moral essays, and several poems, making him one of Rome&#x27;s earliest literary figures.

A patrician of illustrious lineage, Caecus first came to prominence with his election to the position of censor in 312 BC, which he held for five years. During Caecus&#x27;s time in office, aside from his building projects, he introduced several controversial but poorly-understood constitutional reforms: he increased the voting power of the poor and landless in the legislative assemblies, and admitted lower-class citizens to the Roman Senate, though these measures were partially undone by the resentful nobility. In addition, Caecus was the first censor to draw up a formal list of senators. These reforms massively increased the prestige of the censorship, which had previously only been a minor magistracy. As consul (296 BC) and then praetor (295 BC), Caecus led military campaigns against the Etruscans and Samnites. Later in life, having become blind (, whence the surname) from old age, he delivered a speech to the Senate successfully opposing peace with the Epirote king Pyrrhus.

His reforms did trigger some outrage, as he broke a number of established traditions. Appius embroiled himself in several bitter political feuds, especially with the Fabii (a powerful Roman family). Fabius Pictor, who was the earliest Roman historian and a member of the Fabian family, may have been the source for a significant amount of smear against Caecus, accusing him of being a corrupted, immoral demagogue, and an inept general. Owing to the wide divergence in the sources, modern scholars have had very different interpretations of Caecus&#x27; deeds: he has been described as a revolutionary, a reactionary, a would-be tyrant, or a great reformer, comparable to Athenian figures like Cleisthenes and Pericles.

== Family background ==
Caecus, who was originally called Appius Claudius Crassus, was born into the patrician clan of the Claudii, one of the most important Roman families of the time, whose members had held executive offices of state since the beginning of the Republic. The family were widely described in Roman sources as haughty aristocrats with arch-conservative views, though this stereotype was likely only created long after Caecus&#x27;s death. Caecus&#x27;s father was called Gaius Claudius Inregillensis, known only for being appointed dictator in 337 BC and immediately resigning after the augurs had found a religious fault in his appointment.

His mother is not known, but he had a much younger brother, Appius Claudius Caudex, who became consul in 264, four years after Caecus&#x27; elder son. Since Caecus&#x27; sons became consuls over a period of 28 years and long after his own time, he probably married at least twice, even though none of his wives is known.

== Early career ==
The only information known about Caecus&#x27; early career before his censorship is from his eulogy, formerly displayed on the Roman Forum. This summary of his career lists all the responsibilities he held, including some junior offices, while literary sources only record upper magistracies (censor, consul, and praetor); however it does not provide any date and the offices are not ordered chronologically. The eulogy tells that he was the military tribune three times, the quaestor one time, and curule aedile twice. These junior magistracies were standard and found in the career of every Roman politician, but the number of times he held these positions is much more unusual. Endre Ferenczy thought Caecus held them all before his censorship because of his family&#x27;s decline, which forced him to repeat them to build his popularity (especially as aedile, because this magistrate organised games), therefore explaining his early censorship. However, his thesis has been criticised, notably by Stephen Oakley, who notes that there is not enough evidence to know whether iterations of the military tribuneship and aedileship were really exceptional for this period, during which most careers are unknown.

It is nonetheless certain that Caecus was military tribune before his censorship, because it was a requirement for being elected consul, which he became immediately after his censorship. As military tribune, he certainly served during the Second Samnite War (326–304 BC), the main conflict in Italy at the time.

==Censorship (312–308 BC)==
Appius Claudius Caecus was a Roman censor from 312 BC to 308 BC, He was not a consul beforehand which later became a prerequisite for the office. During his time as censor he sought support from the lower classes, by allowing sons of freedmen to serve in the Senate, and extending voting privileges to men in the rural tribes who did not own land. During the Second Samnite War, he advocated the founding of Roman colonies (&quot;colonia&quot;) throughout Latium and Campania to serve as fortifications against the Samnites and Etruscans.

Appius is best known for two construction undertakings as censor: the Appian Way (), the first major Roman road, running between Rome and Beneventum to the south; and the first aqueduct in Rome, the Aqua Appia.

== Legal contributions ==
Appius&#x27; major legal contribution came from him starting the publication of &quot;legis actiones&quot; (&quot;methods of legal practice&quot;). This publication served as a guide for Roman Legal procedure. The publication also included a list of days that court was to be held on.

==Later career (307–280 BC)==
During this time period he served as consul twice; in 307 BC and 296 BC, he was also appointed Dictator in 285 BC. Appius gave a famous speech in this period against Cineas, an envoy of Pyrrhus of Epirus, declaring that Rome would never surrender. The speech is the source of the saying &quot;every man is the architect of his own fortune&quot; (), and was still known in the time of Cicero In 279 BC, Appius went blind due to a curse, according to Livy.

===Literary output===
Appius wrote several books over his life. He wrote a book called &quot;Sententiae&quot;, which was based upon a verse of Greek model. It was &quot;the first Roman book of literary character&quot;. Appius also wrote treatise, (&quot;Concerning Usurpations&quot;), which is lost and the content is unknown. In addition Appius was one of the earliest known Roman prose and verse authors whose name is still known today. He was also concerned with literature and rhetoric, and instituted reforms in Latin orthography, allegedly ending the use of the letter Z.

== Notable quotes ==
&quot;Every man is the architect of his destiny&quot; ()

==Descendants==
His four sons were Appius Claudius Russus (consul in 268), Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul in 249), Gaius Claudius Centho (consul in 240), and Tiberius Claudius Nero (grandfather of the consul of 202).

Appius Claudius Caecus is used in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Pro Caelio&quot; as a stern and disapproving ancestor to Clodia. Cicero assumes the voice of Caecus in a scathing &quot;prosopopoeia&quot;, where Caecus is incensed at Clodia for associating with Caelius, a member of the middle equestrian class instead of the upper patrician class. Caecus&#x27;s achievements, such as the building of the Appian Way and the Aqua Appia, are mentioned as being defiled by Clodia&#x27;s actions.

<text>Menmaatre Seti I (or Sethos I in Greek) was the second pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt during the New Kingdom period, ruling or 1290 BC to 1279 BC. He was the son of Ramesses I and Sitre, and the father of Ramesses II.

The name &#x27;Seti&#x27; means &quot;of Set&quot;, which indicates that he was consecrated to the god Set (also termed &quot;Sutekh&quot; or &quot;Seth&quot;). As with most pharaohs, Seti had several names. Upon his ascension, he took the prenomen &quot;mn-m3&#x27;t-r&#x27; &quot;, usually vocalized in Egyptian as &quot;Menmaatre&quot; (Established is the Justice of Re). His better known nomen, or birth name, is transliterated as &quot;sty mry-n-ptḥ&quot; or &quot;Sety Merenptah&quot;, meaning &quot;Man of Set, beloved of Ptah&quot;. Manetho incorrectly considered him to be the founder of the 19th Dynasty, and gave him a reign length of 55 years, though no evidence has ever been found for so long a reign.

==Reign==
===Background===

After the enormous social upheavals generated by Akhenaten&#x27;s religious reform, Horemheb, Ramesses I and Seti I&#x27;s main priority was to re-establish order in the kingdom and to reaffirm Egypt&#x27;s sovereignty over Canaan and Syria, which had been compromised by the increasing external pressures from the Hittite state. Seti, with energy and determination, confronted the Hittites several times in battle. Without succeeding in destroying the Hittites as a potential danger to Egypt, he reconquered most of the disputed territories for Egypt and generally concluded his military campaigns with victories. The memory of Seti I&#x27;s military successes was recorded in some large scenes placed on the front of the temple of Amun, situated in Karnak. A funerary temple for Seti was constructed in what is now known as Qurna (Mortuary Temple of Seti I), on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes while a magnificent temple made of white limestone at Abydos featuring exquisite relief scenes was started by Seti, and later completed by his son. His capital was at Memphis. He was considered a great king by his peers, but his fame has been overshadowed since ancient times by that of his son, Ramesses II.

===Reign Length===

Seti I&#x27;s known accession date is known to be on III Shemu day 24.
Seti I&#x27;s reign length was either 9 or 11 rather than 15 full years. Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen has estimated that it was 15 years, but there are no dates recorded for Seti I after his Year 11 Gebel Barkal stela. As this king is otherwise quite well documented in historical records, other scholars suggest that a continuous break in the record for his last four years is unlikely, although it is technically possible simply that no records have been yet discovered.
Peter J. Brand noted that the king personally opened new rock quarries at Aswan to build obelisks and colossal statues in his Year 9. This event is commemorated on two rock stelas in Aswan. However, most of Seti&#x27;s obelisks and statues such as the Flaminian and Luxor obelisks were only partly finished or decorated by the time of his death, since they were completed early under his son&#x27;s reign based on epigraphic evidence (they bore the early form of Ramesses II&#x27;s royal prenomen &quot;Usermaatre&quot;). Ramesses II used the prenomen Usermaatre to refer to himself in his first year and did not adopt the final form of his royal title &quot;Usermaatre Setepenre&quot; until late into his second year.

Brand aptly notes that this evidence calls into question the idea of a 15 Year reign for Seti I and suggests that &quot;Seti died after a ten to eleven year reign&quot; because only two years would have passed between the opening of the Rock Quarries and the partial completion and decoration of these monuments. This explanation conforms better with the evidence of the unfinished state of Seti I&#x27;s monuments and the fact that Ramesses II had to complete the decorations on &quot;many of his father&#x27;s unfinished monuments, including the southern half of the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak and portions of his father&#x27;s temples at Gurnah and Abydos&quot; during the very first Year of his own reign. Critically, Brand notes that the larger of the two Aswan rock stelas states that Seti I &quot;has ordered the commissioning of multitudinous works for the making of very great obelisks and great and wondrous statues (i.e. colossi) in the name of His Majesty, L.P.H. He made great barges for transporting them, and ships crews to match them for ferrying them from the quarry.&quot; (KRI 74:12-14) However, despite this promise, Brand stresses that


The German Egyptologist Jürgen von Beckerath also accepts that Seti I&#x27;s reign lasted only 11 Years in a 1997 book. Seti&#x27;s highest known date is Year 11, IV Shemu day 12 or 13 on a sandstone stela from Gebel Barkal but he would have briefly survived for 2 to 3 days into his Year 12 before dying based on the date of Ramesses II&#x27;s rise to power. Seti I&#x27;s accession date has been determined by Wolfgang Helck to be III Shemu day 24, which is very close to Ramesses II&#x27;s known accession date of III Shemu day 27.

More recently, in 2011, the Dutch Egyptologist Jacobus Van Dijk questioned the &quot;Year 11&quot; date stated in the great temple of Amun on the Gebel Barkal stela—Seti I&#x27;s previously known highest attested date. This monument is quite badly preserved but still depicts Seti I in erect posture, which is the only case occurring since his Year 4 when he started to be depicted in a stooping posture on his stelae. Furthermore, the glyphs &quot;I ∩&quot; representing the 11 are damaged in the upper part and may just as well be &quot;I I I&quot; instead. Subsequently, Van Dijk proposed that the Gebel Barkal stela should be dated to Year 3 of Seti I, and that Seti&#x27;s highest date more likely is Year 9 as suggested by the wine jars found in his tomb. In a 2012 paper, David Aston analyzed the wine jars and came to the same conclusion since no wine labels higher than Seti I&#x27;s 8th regnal year were found in his KV17 tomb.

===Military campaigns===

Seti I fought a series of wars in western Asia, Libya and Nubia in the first decade of his reign. The main source for Seti&#x27;s military activities are his battle scenes on the north exterior wall of the Karnak Hypostyle Hall, along with several royal stelas with inscriptions mentioning battles in Canaan and Nubia.

In his first regnal year, he led his armies along the &quot;Horus Military road&quot;, the coastal road that led from the Egyptian city of Tjaru (Zarw/Sile) in the northeast corner of the Egyptian Nile Delta along the northern coast of the Sinai peninsula ending in the town of &quot;Canaan&quot; in the modern Gaza strip. The Ways of Horus consisted of a series of military forts, each with a well, that are depicted in detail in the king&#x27;s war scenes on the north wall of the Karnak Hypostyle Hall. While crossing the Sinai, the king&#x27;s army fought local Bedouins called the Shasu. In Canaan, he received the tribute of some of the city states he visited. Others, including Beth-Shan and Yenoam, had to be captured but were easily defeated. A stele in Beth-Shan testifies to that reconquest; according to Grdsseloff, Rowe, Albrecht et Albright, Seti defeated Asian nomads in war against the Apirus (Hebrews). Dussaud commented Albright&#x27;s article: &quot;The interest of Professor Albright&#x27;s note is mainly due to the fact that he no longer objects to the identification of &quot;Apiru&quot; with &quot;Ibri&quot; (i.e. the Hebrews) provided that we grant him that the vocal change has been driven by a popular etymology that brought the term &quot;eber&quot; (formerly &#x27;ibr), that is to say the man from beyond the river.&quot; It seems that Egypt extends beyond the river. The attack on Yenoam is illustrated in his war scenes, while other battles, such as the defeat of Beth-Shan, were not shown because the king himself did not participate, sending a division of his army instead. The year one campaign continued into Lebanon where the king received the submission of its chiefs who were compelled to cut down valuable cedar wood themselves as tribute.

At some unknown point in his reign, Seti I defeated Libyan tribesmen who had invaded Egypt&#x27;s western border. Although defeated, the Libyans would pose an ever-increasing threat to Egypt during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses III. The Egyptian army also put down a minor &quot;rebellion&quot; in Nubia in the 8th year of Seti I. Seti himself did not participate in it although his crown prince, the future Ramesses II, may have.
===Capture of Kadesh===

The greatest achievement of Seti I&#x27;s foreign policy was the capture of the Syrian town of Kadesh and neighboring territory of Amurru from the Hittite Empire. Egypt had not held Kadesh since the time of Akhenaten. Seti I was successful in defeating a Hittite army that tried to defend the town. He entered the city in triumph together with his son Ramesses II and erected a victory stela at the site which has been found by archaeologists. Kadesh, however, soon reverted to Hittite control because the Egyptians did not or could not maintain a permanent military occupation of Kadesh and Amurru so close to the Hittite homelands. It is unlikely that Seti I made a peace treaty with the Hittites or voluntarily returned Kadesh and Amurru, but he may have reached an informal understanding with the Hittite king Muwatalli on the precise boundaries of their empires. Five years after Seti I&#x27;s death, however, his son Ramesses II resumed hostilities and made a failed attempt to recapture Kadesh. Kadesh was henceforth effectively held by the Hittites even though Ramesses temporarily occupied the city in his 8th year.

The traditional view of Seti I&#x27;s wars was that he restored the Egyptian empire after it had been lost in the time of Akhenaten. This was based on the chaotic picture of Egyptian-controlled Syria and Palestine seen in the Amarna letters, a cache of diplomatic correspondence from the time of Akhenaten found at Akhenaten&#x27;s capital at el-Amarna in Middle Egypt. Recent scholarship, however, indicates that the empire was not lost at this time, except for its northern border provinces of Kadesh and Amurru in Syria and Lebanon. While evidence for the military activities of Akhenaten, Tutankhamun and Horemheb is fragmentary or ambiguous, Seti I left a war monument that glorifies his achievements, along with a number of texts, all of which tend to magnify his prowess on the battlefield.

==Burial==
===Mummy===

From an examination of Seti&#x27;s extremely well-preserved mummy, Seti I appears to have been less than forty years old when he died unexpectedly. This is in stark contrast to the situation with Horemheb, Ramesses I and Ramesses II who all lived to an advanced age. The reasons for his relatively early death are uncertain, but there is no evidence of violence on his mummy. His mummy was found decapitated, but this was likely caused by tomb robbers after his death. The Amun priest carefully reattached his head to his body with the use of linen cloths. It has been suggested that he died from a disease which had affected him for years, possibly related to his heart. The latter was found placed in the right part of the body, while the usual practice of the day was to place it in the left part during the mummification process. Opinions vary whether this was a mistake or an attempt to have Seti&#x27;s heart work better in his afterlife. Seti I&#x27;s mummy is about tall.

In April 2021, his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

===Tomb===
Seti&#x27;s well-preserved tomb (KV17) was found in 1817 by Giovanni Battista Belzoni, in the Valley of the Kings; it proved to be the longest at and deepest of all the New Kingdom royal tombs. It was also the first tomb to feature decorations (including the &quot;Book of the Heavenly Cow&quot;) on every passageway and chamber with highly refined bas-reliefs and colorful paintings – fragments of which, including a large column depicting Seti I with the goddess Hathor, can be seen in the National Archaeological Museum, Florence. This decorative style set a precedent which was followed in full or in part in the tombs of later New Kingdom kings. Seti&#x27;s mummy itself was discovered by Émil Brugsch on June 6, 1881, in the mummy cache (tomb DB320) at Deir el-Bahri and has since been kept at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

His huge sarcophagus, carved in one piece and intricately decorated on every surface (including the goddess Nut on the interior base), is in Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum. Soane bought it for exhibition in his open collection in 1824, when the British Museum refused to pay the £2,000 demanded. On its arrival at the museum, the alabaster was pure white and inlaid with blue copper sulphate. Years of the London climate and pollution have darkened the alabaster to a buff colour and absorbed moisture has caused the hygroscopic inlay material to fall out and disappear completely. A small watercolour nearby records the appearance, as it was.

The tomb also had an entrance to a secret tunnel hidden behind the sarcophagus, which Belzoni&#x27;s team estimated to be long. However, the tunnel was not truly excavated until 1961, when a team led by Sheikh Ali Abdel-Rasoul began digging in hopes of discovering a secret burial chamber containing hidden treasures. The team failed to follow the original passage in their excavations, and had to call a halt due to instabilities in the tunnel; further issues with permits and finances eventually ended Sheikh Ali&#x27;s dreams of treasure, though they were at least able to establish that the passage was over longer than the original estimate. In June 2010, a team from Egypt&#x27;s Ministry of Antiquities led by Dr. Zahi Hawass completed excavation of the tunnel, which had begun again after the discovery in 2007 of a downward-sloping passage beginning approximately into the previously excavated tunnel. After uncovering two separate staircases, they found that the tunnel ran for in total; unfortunately, the last step seemed to have been abandoned prior to completion and no secret burial chamber was found.

==Alleged co-regency with Ramesses II==
Around Year 9 of his reign, Seti appointed his son Ramesses II as the crown prince and his chosen successor, but the evidence for a coregency between the two kings is likely illusory. Peter J. Brand stresses in his thesis that relief decorations at various temple sites at Karnak, Qurna and Abydos, which associate Ramesses II with Seti I, were actually carved after Seti&#x27;s death by Ramesses II himself and, hence, cannot be used as source material to support a co-regency between the two monarchs. In addition, the late William Murnane, who first endorsed the theory of a co-regency between Seti I and Ramesses II, later revised his view of the proposed co-regency and rejected the idea that Ramesses II had begun to count his own regnal years while Seti I was still alive. Finally, Kenneth Kitchen rejects the term co-regency to describe the relationship between Seti I and Ramesses II; he describes the earliest phase of Ramesses II&#x27;s career as a &quot;prince regency&quot; where the young Ramesses enjoyed all the trappings of royalty including the use of a royal titulary and harem but did not count his regnal years until after his father&#x27;s death. This is due to the fact that the evidence for a co-regency between the two kings is vague and highly ambiguous. Two important inscriptions from the first decade of Ramesses&#x27; reign, namely the Abydos Dedicatory Inscription and the Kuban Stela of Ramesses II, consistently give the latter titles associated with those of a crown prince only, namely the &quot;king&#x27;s eldest son and hereditary prince&quot; or &quot;child-heir&quot; to the throne &quot;along with some military titles.&quot;

Hence, no clear evidence supports the hypothesis that Ramesses II was a co-regent under his father. Brand stresses that:

<text>Pocahontas (, ; born Amonute, also known as Matoaka and Rebecca Rolfe; 1596 – March 1617) was a Native American woman belonging to the Powhatan people, notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. She was the daughter of Powhatan, the paramount chief of a network of tributary tribes in the Tsenacommacah, encompassing the Tidewater region of what is today the U.S. state of Virginia.

Pocahontas was captured and held for ransom by English colonists during hostilities in 1613. During her captivity, she was encouraged to convert to Christianity and was baptized under the name Rebecca. She married the tobacco planter John Rolfe in April 1614 at the age of about 17 or 18, and she bore their son, Thomas Rolfe, in January 1615.

In 1616, the Rolfes travelled to London, where Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the &quot;civilized savage&quot; in hopes of stimulating investment in Jamestown. On this trip she may have met Squanto, a Patuxet man from New England. Pocahontas became a celebrity, was elegantly fêted, and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace. In 1617, the Rolfes intended to sail for Virginia, but Pocahontas died at Gravesend, Kent, England, of unknown causes, aged 20 or 21. She was buried in St George&#x27;s Church, Gravesend; her grave&#x27;s exact location is unknown because the church was rebuilt after being destroyed by a fire.

Numerous places, landmarks, and products in the United States have been named after Pocahontas. Her story has been romanticized over the years, many aspects of which are fictional. Many of the stories told about her by the English explorer John Smith have been contested by her documented descendants. She is a subject of art, literature, and film. Many famous people have claimed to be among her descendants, including members of the First Families of Virginia, First Lady Edith Wilson, American actor Glenn Strange, and astronomer Percival Lowell.

==Early life==
Pocahontas&#x27;s birth year is unknown, but some historians estimate it to have been around 1596. In &quot;A True Relation of Virginia&quot; (1608), the English explorer John Smith described meeting Pocahontas in the spring of 1608 when she was &quot;a child of ten years old&quot;. In a 1616 letter, Smith again described her as she was in 1608, but this time as &quot;a child of twelve or thirteen years of age&quot;.

Pocahontas was the daughter of Chief Powhatan, paramount chief of Tsenacommacah, an alliance of about thirty Algonquian-speaking groups and petty chiefdoms in the Tidewater region of the present-day U.S. state of Virginia. Her mother&#x27;s name and origin are unknown, but she was probably of lowly status. English adventurer Henry Spelman had lived among the Powhatan people as an interpreter, and he noted that, when one of the paramount chief&#x27;s many wives gave birth, she was returned to her place of origin and supported there by the paramount chief until she found another husband. However, little is known about Pocahontas&#x27;s mother, and it has been theorized that she died in childbirth. The Mattaponi Reservation people are descendants of the Powhatans, and their oral tradition claims that Pocahontas&#x27;s mother was the first wife of Powhatan and that Pocahontas was named after her.

===Names===
According to colonist William Strachey, &quot;Pocahontas&quot; was a childhood nickname meaning &quot;little wanton&quot;. Some interpret the meaning as &quot;playful one&quot;. In his account, Strachey describes Pocahontas as a child visiting the fort at Jamestown and playing with the young boys; she would &quot;get the boys forth with her into the marketplace and make them wheel, falling on their hands, turning up their heels upwards, whom she would follow and wheel so herself, naked as she was, all the fort over&quot;.

Historian William Stith claimed that &quot;her real name, it seems, was originally Matoax, which the Native Americans carefully concealed from the English and changed it to Pocahontas, out of a superstitious fear, lest they, by the knowledge of her true name, should be enabled to do her some hurt.&quot; According to anthropologist Helen C. Rountree, Pocahontas revealed her secret name to the colonists &quot;only after she had taken another religious – baptismal – name&quot; of Rebecca.

===Title and status===
Pocahontas is frequently viewed as a princess in popular culture. In 1841, William Watson Waldron of Trinity College, Dublin, published &quot;Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems&quot;, calling her &quot;the beloved and only surviving daughter of the king&quot;. She was her father&#x27;s &quot;delight and darling&quot;, according to colonist Captain Ralph Hamor, but she was not in line to inherit a position as a &quot;weroance&quot;, sub-chief, or &quot;mamanatowick&quot; (paramount chief). Instead, Powhatan&#x27;s brothers and sisters and his sisters&#x27; children all stood in line to succeed him. In his &quot;A Map of Virginia&quot;, John Smith explained how matrilineal inheritance worked among the Powhatans:
==Interactions with the colonists==
===John Smith===

Pocahontas is most famously linked to colonist John Smith, who arrived in Virginia with 100 other settlers in April 1607. The colonists built a fort on a marshy peninsula on the James River, and had numerous encounters over the next several months with the people of Tsenacommacah – some of them friendly, some hostile.

A hunting party led by Powhatan&#x27;s close relative Opechancanough captured Smith in December 1607 while he was exploring on the Chickahominy River and brought him to Powhatan&#x27;s capital at Werowocomoco. In his 1608 account, Smith describes a great feast followed by a long talk with Powhatan. He does not mention Pocahontas in relation to his capture, and claims that they first met some months later. Margaret Huber suggests that Powhatan was attempting to bring Smith and the other colonists under his own authority. He offered Smith rule of the town of Capahosic, which was close to his capital at Werowocomoco, as he hoped to keep Smith and his men &quot;nearby and better under control&quot;.

In 1616, Smith wrote a letter to Queen Anne of Denmark, the wife of King James, in anticipation of Pocahontas&#x27; visit to England. In this new account, his capture included the threat of his own death: &quot;at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown.&quot; He expanded on this in his 1624 &quot;Generall Historie&quot;, published seven years after the death of Pocahontas. He explained that he was captured and taken to the paramount chief where &quot;two great stones were brought before Powhatan: then as many as could layd hands on him [Smith], dragged him to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs, to beate out his braines, Pocahontas the Kings dearest daughter, when no intreaty could prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne upon his to save him from death.&quot;

Karen Ordahl Kupperman suggests that Smith used such details to embroider his first account, thus producing a more dramatic second account of his encounter with Pocahontas as a heroine worthy of Queen Anne&#x27;s audience. She argues that its later revision and publication was Smith&#x27;s attempt to raise his own stock and reputation, as he had fallen from favor with the London Company which had funded the Jamestown enterprise. Anthropologist Frederic W. Gleach suggests that Smith&#x27;s second account was substantially accurate but represents his misunderstanding of a three-stage ritual intended to adopt him into the confederacy, but not all writers are convinced, some suggesting the absence of certain corroborating evidence.

Early histories did establish that Pocahontas befriended Smith and the colonists. She often went to the settlement and played games with the boys there. When the colonists were starving, &quot;every once in four or five days, Pocahontas with her attendants brought [Smith] so much provision that saved many of their lives that else for all this had starved with hunger.&quot; As the colonists expanded their settlement, the Powhatans felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again. In late 1609, an injury from a gunpowder explosion forced Smith to return to England for medical care and the colonists told the Powhatans that he was dead. Pocahontas believed that account and stopped visiting Jamestown but learned that Smith was living in England when she traveled there with her husband John Rolfe.

===Capture===

Pocahontas&#x27; capture occurred in the context of the First Anglo-Powhatan War, a conflict between the Jamestown settlers and the Natives which began late in the summer of 1609. In the first years of war, the colonists took control of the James River, both at its mouth and at the falls. In the meantime, Captain Samuel Argall pursued contacts with Native tribes in the northern portion of Powhatan&#x27;s paramount chiefdom. The Patawomecks lived on the Potomac River and were not always loyal to Powhatan, and living with them was Henry Spelman, a young English interpreter. In March 1613, Argall learned that Pocahontas was visiting the Patawomeck village of Passapatanzy and living under the protection of the &quot;weroance&quot; Iopassus (also known as Japazaws).

With Spelman&#x27;s help translating, Argall pressured Iopassus to assist in Pocahontas&#x27; capture by promising an alliance with the colonists against the Powhatans. Iopassus, with the help of his wives, tricked Pocahontas into boarding Argall&#x27;s ship and held her for ransom, demanding the release of colonial prisoners held by her father and the return of various stolen weapons and tools. Powhatan returned the prisoners but failed to satisfy the colonists with the number of weapons and tools that he returned. A long standoff ensued, during which the colonists kept Pocahontas captive.

During the year-long wait, Pocahontas was held at the English settlement of Henricus in present-day Chesterfield County, Virginia. Little is known about her life there, although colonist Ralph Hamor wrote that she received &quot;extraordinary courteous usage&quot;. Linwood &quot;Little Bear&quot; Custalow refers to an oral tradition which claims that Pocahontas was raped; Helen Rountree counters that &quot;other historians have disputed that such oral tradition survived and instead argue that any mistreatment of Pocahontas would have gone against the interests of the English in their negotiations with Powhatan. A truce had been called, the Indians still far outnumbered the English, and the colonists feared retaliation.&quot; At this time, Henricus minister Alexander Whitaker taught Pocahontas about Christianity and helped her improve her English. Upon her baptism, she took the Christian name &quot;Rebecca.&quot;

In March 1614, the stand-off escalated to a violent confrontation between hundreds of colonists and Powhatan men on the Pamunkey River, and the colonists encountered a group of senior Native leaders at Powhatan&#x27;s capital of Matchcot. The colonists allowed Pocahontas to talk to her tribe when Powhatan arrived, and she reportedly rebuked him for valuing her &quot;less than old swords, pieces, or axes&quot;. She said that she preferred to live with the colonists &quot;who loved her&quot;.

===Possible first marriage===
Mattaponi tradition holds that Pocahontas&#x27; first husband was Kocoum, brother of the Patawomeck &quot;weroance&quot; Japazaws, and that Kocoum was killed by the colonists after his wife&#x27;s capture in 1613. Today&#x27;s Patawomecks believe that Pocahontas and Kocoum had a daughter named Ka-Okee who was raised by the Patawomecks after her father&#x27;s death and her mother&#x27;s abduction.

Kocoum&#x27;s identity, location, and very existence have been widely debated among scholars for centuries; the only mention of a &quot;Kocoum&quot; in any English document is a brief statement written about 1616 by William Strachey that Pocahontas had been living married to a &quot;private captaine called Kocoum&quot; for two years. Pocahontas married John Rolfe in 1614, and no other records even hint at any previous husband, so some have suggested that Strachey was mistakenly referring to Rolfe himself, with the reference being later misunderstood as one of Powhatan&#x27;s officers.

===Marriage to John Rolfe===

During her stay at Henricus, Pocahontas met John Rolfe. Rolfe&#x27;s English-born wife Sarah Hacker and child Bermuda had died on the way to Virginia after the wreck of the ship &quot;Sea Venture&quot; on the Summer Isles, now known as Bermuda. He established the Virginia plantation Varina Farms, where he cultivated a new strain of tobacco. Rolfe was a pious man and agonized over the potential moral repercussions of marrying a heathen, though in fact Pocahontas had accepted the Christian faith and taken the baptismal name Rebecca. In a long letter to the governor requesting permission to wed her, he expressed his love for Pocahontas and his belief that he would be saving her soul. He wrote that he was:
The couple were married on April 5, 1614, by chaplain Richard Buck, probably at Jamestown. For two years they lived at Varina Farms, across the James River from Henricus. Their son, Thomas, was born in January 1615.

The marriage created a climate of peace between the Jamestown colonists and Powhatan&#x27;s tribes; it endured for eight years as the &quot;Peace of Pocahontas&quot;. In 1615, Ralph Hamor wrote, &quot;Since the wedding we have had friendly commerce and trade not only with Powhatan but also with his subjects round about us.&quot; The marriage was controversial in the British court at the time because &quot;a commoner&quot; had &quot;the audacity&quot; to marry a &quot;princess&quot;.

One goal of the London Company was to convert Native Americans to Christianity, and they saw an opportunity to promote further investment with the conversion of Pocahontas and her marriage to Rolfe, all of which also helped end the First Anglo-Powhatan War. The company decided to bring Pocahontas to England as a symbol of the tamed New World &quot;savage&quot; and the success of the Virginia colony, and the Rolfes arrived at the port of Plymouth on June 12, 1616. The family journeyed to London by coach, accompanied by eleven other Powhatans including a holy man named Tomocomo. John Smith was living in London at the time while Pocahontas was in Plymouth, and she learned that he was still alive. Smith did not meet Pocahontas, but he wrote to Queen Anne urging that Pocahontas be treated with respect as a royal visitor. He suggested that, if she were treated badly, her &quot;present love to us and Christianity might turn to... scorn and fury&quot;, and England might lose the chance to &quot;rightly have a Kingdom by her means&quot;.

Pocahontas was entertained at various social gatherings. On January 5, 1617, she and Tomocomo were brought before King James at the old Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall at a performance of Ben Jonson&#x27;s masque &quot;The Vision of Delight&quot;. According to Smith, the king was so unprepossessing that neither Pocahontas nor Tomocomo realized whom they had met until it was explained to them afterward.

Pocahontas was not a princess in Powhatan culture, but the London Company presented her as one to the English public because she was the daughter of an important chief. The inscription on a 1616 engraving of Pocahontas reads , meaning &quot;Matoaka, alias Rebecca, daughter of the most powerful prince of the Powhatan Empire of Virginia&quot;. Many English at this time recognized Powhatan as the ruler of an empire, and presumably accorded to his daughter what they considered appropriate status. Smith&#x27;s letter to Queen Anne refers to &quot;Powhatan their chief King&quot;. Cleric and travel writer Samuel Purchas recalled meeting Pocahontas in London, noting that she impressed those whom she met because she &quot;carried her selfe as the daughter of a king&quot;. When he met her again in London, Smith referred to her deferentially as a &quot;King&#x27;s daughter&quot;.

Pocahontas was apparently treated well in London. At the masque, her seats were described as &quot;well placed&quot; and, according to Purchas, London&#x27;s Bishop John King &quot;entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond what I have seen in his greate hospitalitie afforded to other ladies&quot;.

Not all the English were so impressed, however. Helen C. Rountree claims that there is no contemporaneous evidence to suggest that Pocahontas was regarded in England &quot;as anything like royalty,&quot; despite the writings of John Smith. Rather, she was considered to be something of a curiosity, according to Rountree, who suggests that she was merely &quot;the Virginian woman&quot; to most Englishmen.

Pocahontas and Rolfe lived in the suburb of Brentford, Middlesex, for some time, as well as at Rolfe&#x27;s family home at Heacham, Norfolk. In early 1617, Smith met the couple at a social gathering and wrote that, when Pocahontas saw him, &quot;without any words, she turned about, obscured her face, as not seeming well contented,&quot; and was left alone for two or three hours. Later, they spoke more; Smith&#x27;s record of what she said to him is fragmentary and enigmatic. She reminded him of the &quot;courtesies she had done,&quot; saying, &quot;you did promise Powhatan what was yours would be his, and he the like to you.&quot; She then discomfited him by calling him &quot;father,&quot; explaining that Smith had called Powhatan &quot;father&quot; when he was a stranger in Virginia, &quot;and by the same reason so must I do you&quot;. Smith did not accept this form of address because, he wrote, Pocahontas outranked him as &quot;a King&#x27;s daughter&quot;. Pocahontas then said, &quot;with a well-set countenance&quot;:

Finally, Pocahontas told Smith that she and her tribe had thought him dead, but her father had told Tomocomo to seek him &quot;because your countrymen will lie much&quot;.

==Death==

In March 1617, Rolfe and Pocahontas boarded a ship to return to Virginia, but they had sailed only as far as Gravesend on the River Thames when Pocahontas became gravely ill. She was taken ashore, where she died from unknown causes, aged approximately 21 and &quot;much lamented&quot;. According to Rolfe, she declared that &quot;all must die&quot;; for her, it was enough that her child lived. Speculated causes of her death include pneumonia, smallpox, tuberculosis, hemorrhagic dysentery (&quot;the Bloody flux&quot;) and poisoning.

Pocahontas&#x27;s funeral took place on March 21, 1617, in the parish of St George&#x27;s Church, Gravesend. Her grave is thought to be underneath the church&#x27;s chancel, though that church was destroyed in a fire in 1727 and its exact site is unknown. Since 1958 she has been commemorated by a life-sized bronze statue in St. George&#x27;s churchyard, a replica of the 1907 Jamestown sculpture by the American sculptor William Ordway Partridge.

==Legacy==
Pocahontas and John Rolfe had a son, Thomas Rolfe, born in January 1615. Thomas and his wife, Jane Poythress, had a daughter, Jane Rolfe, who was born in Varina, in present-day Henrico County, Virginia, on October 10, 1650. Jane married Robert Bolling of present-day Prince George County, Virginia. Their son, John Bolling, was born in 1676. John Bolling married Mary Kennon and had six surviving children, each of whom married and had surviving children.

In 1907, Pocahontas was the first Native American to be honored on a U.S. stamp. She was a member of the inaugural class of Virginia Women in History in 2000. In July 2015, the Pamunkey Native tribe became the first federally recognized tribe in the state of Virginia; they are descendants of the Powhatan chiefdom, of which Pocahontas was a member. Pocahontas is the twelfth great-grandmother of the American actor Edward Norton.

==Cultural representations==

After her death, increasingly fanciful and romanticized representations were produced about Pocahontas, in which she and Smith are frequently portrayed as romantically involved. Contemporaneous sources substantiate claims of their friendship but not romance. The first claim of their romantic involvement was in John Davis&#x27; &quot;Travels in the United States of America&quot; (1803).

Rayna Green has discussed the similar fetishization that Native and Asian women experience. Both groups are viewed as &quot;exotic&quot; and &quot;submissive,&quot; which aids their dehumanization. Also, Green touches on how Native women had to either &quot;keep their exotic distance or die,&quot; which is associated with the widespread image of Pocahontas trying to sacrifice her life for John Smith.

Cornel Pewewardy writes, &quot;In Pocahontas, Indian characters such as Grandmother Willow, Meeko, and Flit belong to the Disney tradition of familiar animals. In so doing, they are rendered as cartoons, certainly less realistic than Pocahontas and John Smith; In this way, Indians remain marginal and invisible, thereby ironically being &#x27;strangers in their own lands&#x27; – the shadow Indians. They fight desperately on the silver screen in defense of their asserted rights, but die trying to kill the white hero or save the Indian woman.’&quot;

===Contemporary Media Portrayals of Pocahontas===
Pocahontas being one of the most notable Native women in history means it is inevitable that her life will be used within contemporary media. Whether that depiction is positive or negative depends on the intent behind creation. For instance, Pocahontas became popular within the media after the release of the Pocahontas Disney film in 1995. This depiction is not inherently malicious in intent, however, it enforces the stereotype that Native people and culture is mythical, and in a sense, fictional in its entirety with the use of characters like Grandmother Willow, Pocahontas’s animal sidekicks, and the characterization of Native spirits that often call to and provide help to Pocahontas on her journey to 17th century England. Pocahontas who is depicted as a &quot;noble, romantic savage–an innocent, one with nature, and inherently good&quot; person, despite her being a Native woman only perpetuates the &quot;single image mainstream society has of Natives as gentle, traditional, and stuck in the past.&quot; Though it can be assumed that the intent behind creating the film was not one of racism, and in fact may have actually stemmed from a desire to educate and provide representation for Native groups, it still only pushes a harmful narrative.  

Another example of a mainstream media depiction of Pocahontas is the Disney game &quot;Pocahontas&quot;&quot;.&quot; This game follows Pocahontas and her animal sidekick Meeko on an adventure through the forest, where players switch between the two characters to overcome obstacles by gaining various abilities provided by animal spirits. The game follows the main plot of the Disney film with some variation to the story. Throughout this game, Pocahontas still portrays the noble savage archetype and the presence of an overly spiritual and connected to nature narrative is in a sense more prominent in the game than in the film. This is due to the fact that for Pocahontas to complete some of the tasks within the game, spirit animals will grant her special animalistic abilities in order to continue her journey. This can be anything from a fish giving her the ability to breathe underwater, to a squirrel allowing her to climb up trees with ease. This can be seen as problematic in a multitude of ways, mainly with the perpetuation that all Native people possess a deep spiritual connection to nature, this kind of imagery creates a cultural constraint on what Native groups are allowed to be within a contemporary society. By pushing this narrative, it generalizes all Native groups and cultures into one creating a loss of individuality and essentially erasing certain groups completely. 

Creating characters out of real people like Pocahontas, sugarcoats the actual history and trauma endured by these Native groups. It also makes the person and events come across as fictional when incorporated into Disney films alongside actual fictional characters like Belle, Aurora, and The Little Mermaid, stripping a real Native woman’s identity to nothing but child-like entertainment. This is why though the film and video game may not have had malicious intent behind production it still creates a negative visual to the way people view Native people and culture, whether they realize it or not.

<doc id="237524" wikidata="Q341438" url="?curid=237524" title="Acilia gens">
<text>The gens Acilia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome, that flourished from the middle of the third century BC until at least the fifth century AD, a period of seven hundred years. The first of the gens to achieve prominence was Gaius Acilius, who was quaestor in 203 and tribune of the plebs in 197 BC.

==Praenomina==
The Acilii were particularly fond of the praenomen &quot;Manius&quot;, which they used more than any other. They also used the names &quot;Gaius, Lucius, Caeso&quot;, and &quot;Marcus&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==
The three main branches of the Acilii bore the cognomina &quot;Aviola, Balbus&quot;, and &quot;Glabrio&quot;.

The Glabriones were the first family to appear in history, and they continued the longest. Members of this family have been identified from the third century BC into the fifth century AD, a span of time that no other Roman family can be proved to have bridged. According to Millar, &quot;[t]he one indubitable case of continuity from the republic to the fourth century is the Acilii Glabriones.&quot; They were certainly plebeian, as many of them were tribunes of the plebs. They also had a garden, the , on the Pincian Hill in the 2nd century. A tomb of the Acilii Glabriones was found in Rome in 1888. The surname &quot;Glabrio&quot; is derived from the adjective , &quot;smooth&quot;, and probably referred to someone who was bald. Dondin-Payre suggests that, interpreted as &quot;hairless&quot; or &quot;depilated&quot;, &quot;Glabrio&quot; had the further connotation of &quot;effeminate&quot;.

The Acilii Balbi, like the Glabriones, were definitely plebeian. The surname &quot;Balbus&quot; was quite common at Rome, and originally given to one who stammered. A coin of this family depicts the head of Pallas within a laurel wreath on the obverse, and on the reverse, a quadriga bearing Jupiter and Victoria.

The Acilii Aviolae appear at the very end of the Republic, or under the early emperors. There is some confusion between them and the Glabriones, with the consul of 33 BC being identified as &quot;Marcus Acilius Glabrio&quot; in some writers, and &quot;Manius Acilius Aviola&quot; in others. Given the antiquity of the Glabriones, it seems likely that one of them was the ancestor of the Aviolae, and might have used both surnames at various points in time. As for the name &quot;Aviola&quot;, it seems to be a diminutive, presumably of , &quot;grandmother&quot;.

==Members==
===Acilii Glabriones===
* Lucius Acilius, grandfather of the consul of 191 BC.
* Gaius Acilius L. f., father of the consul of 191 BC.
* Manius Acilius C. f. L. n. Glabrio, consul in 191 BC, carried on the War against Antiochus with considerable success, earning a triumph.

* Manius Acilius M&#x27;. f. C. n. Glabrio, as a young man in 181 BC, dedicated the temple of Pietas that has been vowed by his father during the War against Antiochus. He was curule aedile in 166, and celebrated the Megalensian Games. In 154, Glabrio was elected consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in the place of Lucius Postumius Albinus, who had died.

<doc id="237526" wikidata="Q584580" url="?curid=237526" title="Satori">
<text>Satori () is a Japanese Buddhist term for &quot;awakening&quot;, &quot;comprehension; understanding&quot;. The word derives from the Japanese verb &quot;satoru&quot;.

In the Zen Buddhist tradition, &quot;satori&quot; refers to a deep experience of &quot;kenshō&quot;, &quot;seeing into one&#x27;s true nature&quot;. &quot;Ken&quot; means &quot;seeing,&quot; &quot;shō&quot; means &quot;nature&quot; or &quot;essence&quot;.

&quot;Satori&quot; and &quot;kenshō&quot; are commonly translated as &quot;enlightenment&quot;, a word that is also used to translate &quot;bodhi&quot;, &quot;prajñā&quot; and Buddhahood.

==Definition==
&quot;Satori&quot; means the experience of awakening (&quot;enlightenment&quot;) or apprehension of the true nature of reality. It is often considered an experience which cannot be expressed in words. While the term &quot;satori&quot; is derived from the Japanese verb &quot;to know&quot; (&quot;satoru&quot;), it is distinct from the philosophical concept of knowledge as it represents a transcendence of the distinction between one that knows and knowledge.

D. T. Suzuki, a Japanese author of books and essays on Buddhism, Zen and Shin that were influential in the West, described &quot;... looking into one&#x27;s nature or the opening of satori&quot;; and said &quot;This acquiring of a new point of view in our dealings with life and the world is popularly called by Japanese Zen students &#x27;satori&#x27; (&quot;wu&quot; in Chinese). It is really another name for Enlightenment (&quot;anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi&quot;)&quot;.

==&quot;Satori&quot; and &quot;kenshō&quot;==

&quot;Satori&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;kenshō&quot;. &quot;Kenshō&quot; refers to the perception of the Buddha-nature or emptiness. While the terms have the same meaning, customarily &quot;satori&quot; is used to refer to full, deep experience of enlightenment (such as of the Buddha), while &quot;kenshō&quot; is used to refer to a first experience of enlightenment that can still be expanded. 

Distinct from this first insight, &quot;daigo-tettei&quot; is used to refer to a &quot;deep&quot; or lasting realization of the nature of existence.
==Importance==
According to D. T. Suzuki,

This view is typical of Rinzai, which emphasizes &quot;satori&quot;. The Sōtō school rejects this emphasis, and instead emphasizes &quot;silent illumination&quot; through the practice of &quot;zazen&quot;.

==Realizing &quot;satori&quot;==
In Japanese Buddhism, &quot;satori&quot; is a &quot;first step&quot; or embarkation toward Buddhahood:
The student&#x27;s mind must be prepared by rigorous study, with the use of koans, and the practice of meditation to concentrate the mind, under the guidance of a teacher. Koans are short anecdotes of verbal exchanges between teachers and students, typically of the Song dynasty, dealing with Buddhist teachings. The Rinzai school utilizes classic collections of koans such as &quot;The Gateless Barrier&quot;. &quot;The Gateless Barrier&quot; was assembled by the early 13th-century Chinese Zen master Wumen Huikai.

Wumen struggled for six years with koan &quot;Zhaozhou&#x27;s dog&quot;, assigned to him by Yuelin Shiguan (月林師觀; Japanese: Gatsurin Shikan) (1143–1217), before attaining &quot;kenshō&quot;. After his understanding had been confirmed by Yuelin, Wumen wrote the following enlightenment poem:

<doc id="237535" wikidata="Q1497501" url="?curid=237535" title="Shikantaza">
<text>is Dogen&#x27;s Japanese translation of the Chinese phrase &quot;zhǐguǎn dǎzuò&quot; (), &quot;focus on meditative practice alone&quot;, although many modern Western practitioners have interpreted this very differently. The phrase was used by Dogen&#x27;s teacher Rujing, a monk of the Caodong school of Chan Buddhism, to refer to the meditation-practice called &quot;silent illumination&quot; (), or &quot;serene reflection&quot;, taught by the Caodong master Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091–1157). In Japan, it is associated with the Zen Soto school, Dogen&#x27;s offshoot of Caodong. Some practitioners teach that &quot;shikantaza&quot; means that one should not focus attention on a specific object (such as the breath), instead &quot;just sitting&quot; in a state of conscious awareness. However, the 13th-century origin of the expression indicates a general emphasis on meditation in any form as sufficient for spiritual enlightenment. The original teaching was meant to criticize the complicated ceremony, abstruse study, endless tracing of spiritual lineage, and other aspects of Buddhism that even by the 12th century had been identified as excessive.

==Etymology and meaning==
The term &quot;shikantaza&quot; is the Sino-Japanese reading of &quot;Zhǐguǎn dǎzuò&quot; (只管打坐 / 祇管打坐) &quot;just sitting&quot;, &quot;nothing but sitting&quot;, &quot;meditation of just sitting&quot;, &quot;just mind [yourself] sitting&quot;. &quot;Zhǐguǎn dǎzuò&quot; () translates as follows:
* &quot;zhǐguǎn&quot; (, J. &quot;shikan&quot;; or , with [zhǐ] serving as a variant of [zhǐ]), &quot;by all means; merely, simply; only concerned with&quot;, &quot;to focus exclusively on&quot;;
* &quot;dǎzuò&quot; , &quot;[Buddhism/Daoism] sit in meditation&quot;, &quot;to squat, sit down cross-legged&quot;, which corresponds with Sanskrit &quot;utkuṭuka-stha&quot;;

The inspiration for this teaching derives from a pivotal episode reportedly occurring sometime in the early 1220s (Song dynasty), at Tiantong Mountain Monastery (, also known as Jingde Monastery , east of modern-day Ningbo). An exchange took place between the eminent Chinese Caodong teacher Rujing and his disciples. In particular, it focuses on an inspiration by one of Rujing&#x27;s Japanese disciples, Dōgen, who would later found the Sōtō Zen sect:

While T.G. Foulk&#x27;s translation here reads only &quot;sit&quot;, he and other interpreters clarify that the meaning of is generally broad, meaning more than simply sitting. The original exchange between Rujing and his disciples indicates a clear meaning of the teaching: that high-flung ceremony and study are unnecessary and irrelevant, that zazen, dhyana, and similar meditation practice of whatever kind (whether sitting, resting, breathing, gazing at a scene, walking, or simply engaging in silence) should be sufficiently effective.

James Ishmael Ford states that &quot;some trace the root of this word [&quot;shikantaza&quot;] to the Japanese pronunciation of Sanskrit vipassana, though this is far from certain.&quot; This etymological error about (&quot;shikan&quot;, &quot;only&quot;, &quot;just&quot;) is rooted in the fact that Japanese has many homophones pronounced &quot;shikan&quot;. It stems from a more commonly used Japanese word, namely (&quot;shikan&quot;, &quot;concentration and observation&quot;) (as practiced by the Tendai sect) that translates the Sanskrit &quot;&quot;śamatha&quot; and &quot;vipaśyanā&quot;,&quot; the two basic forms of Buddhist meditation.

The phrase &quot;zhǐguǎn dǎzuò&quot; (&quot;just sitting&quot;) was used by Dōgen&#x27;s teacher Tiantong Rujing (1162–1228) for silent illumination (Chinese &quot;mòzhào&quot; 默照; Japanese ). According to Koten Benson, in &quot;mochao&quot; 
==Practice==
===Classical sources===
&quot;Silent illumination&quot; or &quot;silent reflection&quot; was the hallmark of the Chinese Caodong school of Chan. The first Chan teacher to articulate silent illumination was the Caodong master Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091—1157), who wrote an inscription entitled &quot;silent illumination meditation&quot; (&quot;Mokushō zen&quot; 默照禅 or &quot;Mòzhào chán&quot; 默照禪). Sheng-yen explains that

With the phrase &quot;shikantaza&quot; Dōgen means &quot;doing only zazen whole-heartedly&quot; or &quot;single-minded sitting.&quot; According to Merv Fowler, shikantaza is described best as &quot;quiet sitting in open awareness, reflecting directly the reality of life.&quot; According to Austin, &quot;shikantaza&quot; is &quot;an alert condition, performed erect, with no trace of sluggishness or drowsiness.&quot; Fred Reinhard Dallmayr writes, 
===Modern sources===
Zen master John Daido Loori describes &quot;shikantaza&quot; as a challenging practice in spite of its name&#x27;s simplicity. Mental strength (&quot;joriki&quot;) is not achieved through sustained concentration as in breath meditation, but through awareness of the flow of mind, without actively attempting to let go of a thought. The user must watch its thoughts, &quot;without analyzing them, judging them, attempting to understand or categorize them,&quot; being only aware of them. According to him, this helps mental activity move on and produce samadhi.

Commenting on Loori&#x27;s words, meditation expert Eric Harrison likens &quot;shikantaza&quot; to a psychological process of extinction, in which repeated reduction of a behavioral response eventually leads to no response.

Loori describes awareness as the one thing necessary to the practice of shikantaza. This requires a heightened state of mental alertness, which he warns cannot be maintained for too long periods of time. He recommends to practice &quot;shikantaza&quot; half an hour to an hour, then stand up and practice &quot;kinhin&quot; in order to relax the mind before sitting down and continuing.

Shunryū Suzuki states about &quot;shikantaza&quot;, &quot;do not try to stop your mind, but leave everything as it is. Then things will not stay in your mind for so long. Things will come as they come and go as they go. Eventually your clear, empty mind will last fairly long.&quot; For his part, describing the practice&#x27;s goal as being simply aware of thoughts without getting caught by them, Sean Murphy cites Taizan Maezumi as advising to &quot;regard our thoughts as if they were clouds, watching them as they drift from one end of the mind to the other, but making no attempt to hold onto them - and when they pass over the horizon, as they inevitably will, making no attempt to grasp after them.

Jundo Cohen warns that its meaning of &quot;just sitting&quot; must not be taken too literally, and underlines the importance of awareness. When faced against strong emotions or anxious thoughts, Cohen instructs to simply observe them with equanimity, &quot;treating them like passing weather clouds&quot;. At the same time, he stresses not to play with and being pulled in by thoughts. He compares &quot;shikantaza&quot; to &quot;the children&#x27;s puzzle of Chinese finger cuffs, which are escaped not by forceful effort, but by non-resistance&quot;. Only by dropping the hunt for enlightenment, accepting everything without grasping or avoiding, can enlightenment be found in it.

====Similar techniques====
A modern technique described as similar to &quot;shikantaza&quot; is called &quot;Do Nothing Meditation&quot; by Shinzen Young. The user is instructed to let go of all mental intentions, without trying to meditate or concentrate in any way. Any distraction or thought is allowed, unless the user feels they are intentionally thinking or doing something, in which case they must stop this intention and let it go, including any possible struggle at it. As a result, &quot;eventually the mind feels very spacious, open, and relaxed, but also bright, clear, and vivid&quot;.

Another similar description comes from Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, in &quot;I Am That&quot;, where he recommends &quot;letting thoughts flow and watching them and to keep the mind quiet. &quot;The state of freedom from all thoughts will happen suddenly and by the bliss of it you shall recognize it.&quot;

<text>Information privacy is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, contextual information norms, and the legal and political issues surrounding them. It is also known as data privacy or data protection.

==Information types==
Various types of personal information often come under privacy concerns.

===Cable television===
This describes the ability to control what information one reveals about oneself over cable television, and who can access that information. For example, third parties can track IP TV programs someone has watched at any given time. &quot;The addition of any information in a broadcasting stream is not required for an audience rating survey, additional devices are not requested to be installed in the houses of viewers or listeners, and without the necessity of their cooperations, audience ratings can be automatically performed in real-time.&quot;

===Educational===
In the United Kingdom in 2012, the Education Secretary Michael Gove described the National Pupil Database as a &quot;rich dataset&quot; whose value could be &quot;maximised&quot; by making it more openly accessible, including to private companies. Kelly Fiveash of &quot;The Register&quot; said that this could mean &quot;a child&#x27;s school life including exam results, attendance, teacher assessments and even characteristics&quot; could be available, with third-party organizations being responsible for anonymizing any publications themselves, rather than the data being anonymized by the government before being handed over. An example of a data request that Gove indicated had been rejected in the past, but might be possible under an improved version of privacy regulations, was for &quot;analysis on sexual exploitation&quot;.

===Financial===

Information about a person&#x27;s financial transactions, including the amount of assets, positions held in stocks or funds, outstanding debts, and purchases can be sensitive. If criminals gain access to information such as a person&#x27;s accounts or credit card numbers, that person could become the victim of fraud or identity theft. Information about a person&#x27;s purchases can reveal a great deal about that person&#x27;s history, such as places they have visited, whom they have contact with, products they have used, their activities and habits, or medications they have used. In some cases, corporations may use this information to target individuals with marketing customized towards those individual&#x27;s personal preferences, which that person may or may not approve.

===Information technology===

As heterogeneous information systems with differing privacy rules are interconnected and information is shared, policy appliances will be required to reconcile, enforce, and monitor an increasing amount of privacy policy rules (and laws). There are two categories of technology to address privacy protection in commercial IT systems: communication and enforcement.

;Policy communication

*P3P – The Platform for Privacy Preferences. P3P is a standard for communicating privacy practices and comparing them to the preferences of individuals.

;Policy enforcement

*XACML – The Extensible Access Control Markup Language together with its Privacy Profile is a standard for expressing privacy policies in a machine-readable language which a software system can use to enforce the policy in enterprise IT systems.
*EPAL – The Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language is very similar to XACML, but is not yet a standard.
* WS-Privacy – &quot;Web Service Privacy&quot; will be a specification for communicating privacy policy in web services. For example, it may specify how privacy policy information can be embedded in the SOAP envelope of a web service message.

;Improving privacy through individualization

Computer privacy can be improved through individualization. Currently security messages are designed for the &quot;average user&quot;, i.e. the same message for everyone. Researchers have posited that individualized messages and security &quot;nudges&quot;, crafted based on users&#x27; individual differences and personality traits, can be used for further improvements for each person&#x27;s compliance with computer security and privacy.

Improve privacy through data encryption

By converting data into a non-readable format, encryption prevents unauthorized access. At present, common encryption technologies include AES and RSA. Use data encryption so that only users with decryption keys can access the data.

===Internet===

The ability to control the information one reveals about oneself over the internet and who can access that information has become a growing concern. These concerns include whether email can be stored or read by third parties without consent or whether third parties can continue to track the websites that someone visited. Another concern is whether websites one visits can collect, store, and possibly share personally identifiable information about users.

The advent of various search engines and the use of data mining created a capability for data about individuals to be collected and combined from a wide variety of sources very easily. AI facilitated creating inferential information about individuals and groups based on such enormous amounts of collected data, transforming the information economy.
 The FTC has provided a set of guidelines that represent widely accepted concepts concerning fair information practices in an electronic marketplace, called the Fair Information Practice Principles. But these have been critiqued for their insufficiency in the context of AI-enabled inferential information.
On the internet many users give away a lot of information about themselves: unencrypted emails can be read by the administrators of an e-mail server if the connection is not encrypted (no HTTPS), and also the internet service provider and other parties sniffing the network traffic of that connection are able to know the contents.
The same applies to any kind of traffic generated on the Internet, including web browsing, instant messaging, and others.
In order not to give away too much personal information, emails can be encrypted and browsing of webpages as well as other online activities can be done anonymously via anonymizers, or by open source distributed anonymizers, so-called mix networks.
Well-known open-source mix nets include I2P – The Anonymous Network and Tor.

Email is not the only internet content with privacy concerns. In an age where increasing amounts of information are online, social networking sites pose additional privacy challenges. People may be tagged in photos or have valuable information exposed about themselves either by choice or unexpectedly by others, referred to as participatory surveillance. Data about location can also be accidentally published, for example, when someone posts a picture with a store as a background. Caution should be exercised when posting information online. Social networks vary in what they allow users to make private and what remains publicly accessible. Without strong security settings in place and careful attention to what remains public, a person can be profiled by searching for and collecting disparate pieces of information, leading to cases of cyberstalking or reputation damage.

Cookies are used on websites so that users may allow the website to retrieve some information from the user&#x27;s internet, but they usually do not mention what the data being retrieved is. In 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) passed a regulation that forces websites to visibly disclose to consumers their information privacy practices, referred to as cookie notices. This was issued to give consumers the choice of what information about their behavior they consent to letting websites track; however, its effectiveness is controversial. Some websites may engage in deceptive practices such as placing cookie notices in places on the page that are not visible or only giving consumers notice that their information is being tracked but not allowing them to change their privacy settings. Apps like Instagram and Facebook collect user data for a personalized app experience; however, they track user activity on other apps, which jeopardizes users&#x27; privacy and data. By controlling how visible these cookie notices are, companies can discreetly collect data, giving them more power over consumers.

===Locational===
As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are advancing (location-based services), problems related to user privacy arise. Location data is among the most sensitive data currently being collected. A list of potentially sensitive professional and personal information that could be inferred about an individual knowing only their mobility trace was published in 2009 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. These include the movements of a competitor sales force, attendance of a particular church or an individual&#x27;s presence in a motel, or at an abortion clinic. A recent MIT study by de Montjoye et al. showed that four spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5 million people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

===Medical===

People may not wish for their medical records to be revealed to others due to the confidentiality and sensitivity of what the information could reveal about their health. For example, they might be concerned that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment. Or, it may be because they would not wish for others to know about any medical or psychological conditions or treatments that would bring embarrassment upon themselves. Revealing medical data could also reveal other details about one&#x27;s personal life. There are three major categories of medical privacy: informational (the degree of control over personal information), physical (the degree of physical inaccessibility to others), and psychological (the extent to which the doctor respects patients&#x27; cultural beliefs, inner thoughts, values, feelings, and religious practices and allows them to make personal decisions).
Physicians and psychiatrists in many cultures and countries have standards for doctor–patient relationships, which include maintaining confidentiality. In some cases, the physician–patient privilege is legally protected. These practices are in place to protect the dignity of patients, and to ensure that patients feel free to reveal complete and accurate information required for them to receive the correct treatment.
To view the United States&#x27; laws on governing privacy of private health information, see HIPAA and the HITECH Act. The Australian law is the Privacy Act 1988 Australia as well as state-based health records legislation.

===Political===

Political privacy has been a concern since voting systems emerged in ancient times. The secret ballot is the simplest and most widespread measure to ensure that political views are not known to anyone other than the voters themselves—it is nearly universal in modern democracy and considered to be a basic right of citizenship. In fact, even where other rights of privacy do not exist, this type of privacy very often does. There are several forms of voting fraud or privacy violations possible with the use of digital voting machines.

==Legality==

The legal protection of the right to privacy in general – and of data privacy in particular – varies greatly around the world.

Laws and regulations related to Privacy and Data Protection are constantly changing, it is seen as important to keep abreast of any changes in the law and to continually reassess compliance with data privacy and security regulations. Within academia, Institutional Review Boards function to assure that adequate measures are taken to ensure both the privacy and confidentiality of human subjects in research.

Privacy concerns exist wherever personally identifiable information or other sensitive information is collected, stored, used, and finally destroyed or deleted – in digital form or otherwise. Improper or non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues. Informed consent mechanisms including dynamic consent are important in communicating to data subjects the different uses of their personally identifiable information. Data privacy issues may arise in response to information from a wide range of sources, such as:
* Healthcare records
* Criminal justice investigations and proceedings
* Financial institutions and transactions
* Biological traits, such as genetic material
* Residence and geographic records
* Privacy breach
* Location-based service and geolocation
* Web surfing behavior or user preferences using persistent cookies
* Academic research

===Safe Harbor program===

The United States Department of Commerce created the International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles certification program in response to the 1995 Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) of the European Commission. Both the United States and the European Union officially state that they are committed to upholding information privacy of individuals, but the former has caused friction between the two by failing to meet the standards of the EU&#x27;s stricter laws on personal data. The negotiation of the Safe Harbor program was, in part, to address this long-running issue. Directive 95/46/EC declares in Chapter IV Article 25 that personal data may only be transferred from the countries in the European Economic Area to countries which provide adequate privacy protection. Historically, establishing adequacy required the creation of national laws broadly equivalent to those implemented by Directive 95/46/EU. Although there are exceptions to this blanket prohibition – for example where the disclosure to a country outside the EEA is made with the consent of the relevant individual (Article 26(1)(a)) – they are limited in practical scope. As a result, Article 25 created a legal risk to organizations which transfer personal data from Europe to the United States.

The program regulates the exchange of passenger name record information between the EU and the US. According to the EU directive, personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection. Some exceptions to this rule are provided, for instance when the controller themself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules.

The European Commission has set up the &quot;Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data,&quot; commonly known as the &quot;Article 29 Working Party&quot;. The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countries.

The Working Party negotiated with U.S. representatives about the protection of personal data, the Safe Harbor Principles were the result. Notwithstanding that approval, the self-assessment approach of the Safe Harbor remains controversial with a number of European privacy regulators and commentators.

The Safe Harbor program addresses this issue in the following way: rather than a blanket law imposed on all organizations in the United States, a voluntary program is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. U.S. organizations which register with this program, having self-assessed their compliance with a number of standards, are &quot;deemed adequate&quot; for the purposes of Article 25. Personal information can be sent to such organizations from the EEA without the sender being in breach of Article 25 or its EU national equivalents. The Safe Harbor was approved as providing adequate protection for personal data, for the purposes of Article 25(6), by the European Commission on 26 July 2000.

Under the Safe Harbor, adoptee organizations need to carefully consider their compliance with the &quot;onward transfer obligations&quot;, where personal data originating in the EU is transferred to the US Safe Harbor, and then onward to a third country. The alternative compliance approach of &quot;binding corporate rules&quot;, recommended by many EU privacy regulators, resolves this issue. In addition, any dispute arising in relation to the transfer of HR data to the US Safe Harbor must be heard by a panel of EU privacy regulators.

In July 2007, a new, controversial, Passenger Name Record agreement between the US and the EU was made. A short time afterwards, the Bush administration gave exemption for the Department of Homeland Security, for the Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) and for the Automated Target System from the 1974 Privacy Act.

In February 2008, Jonathan Faull, the head of the EU&#x27;s Commission of Home Affairs, complained about the US bilateral policy concerning PNR. The US had signed in February 2008 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Czech Republic in exchange of a visa waiver scheme, without concerting before with Brussels. The tensions between Washington and Brussels are mainly caused by a lesser level of data protection in the US, especially since foreigners do not benefit from the US Privacy Act of 1974. Other countries approached for bilateral MOU included the United Kingdom, Estonia, Germany and Greece.

<text>The Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) is a wading bird of the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is widespread across much of Australia. It has a predominantly white plumage with a bare, black head, long downcurved bill, and black legs. While it is closely related to the African sacred ibis, the Australian white ibis is a native Australian bird. Contrary to urban myth, it is not a feral species introduced to Australia by people, and it does not come from Egypt.

Historically rare in urban areas, the Australian white ibis has established in urban areas of the east coast in increasing numbers since the late 1970s; it is now commonly seen in Wollongong, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin, the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Townsville. In recent years, the bird has also become increasingly common in Perth, Western Australia, and surrounding towns in south-western Australia. Populations have disappeared from natural breeding areas such as the Macquarie Marshes in northern New South Wales. Management plans have been introduced to control problematic urban populations in Sydney.

Due to its increasing presence in the urban environment and its habit of rummaging in garbage, the species has acquired a variety of colloquial names such as &quot;tip turkey&quot; and &quot;bin chicken&quot;, and in recent years has become an icon of Australia&#x27;s popular culture, regarded with glee by some and passionate revulsion by others.

==Taxonomy==
It was initially described by Georges Cuvier in 1829 as &quot;Ibis molucca&quot;. It is considered part of a superspecies complex with the sacred ibis (&quot;T. aethiopicus&quot;) of Africa, and the black-headed ibis (&quot;T. melanocephalus&quot;) of Asia. Its status in the complex has vacillated over the years. Many older guidebooks referred to the bird as a species, &quot;T. molucca&quot;, until a comprehensive review of plumage patterns by Holyoak in 1970. Holyoak noted the three species&#x27; similarities and that the Australian taxon resembled &quot;T. aethiopicus&quot; in adult plumage and &quot;T. melanocephalus&quot; in juvenile plumage. He proposed that they all be considered part of a single species, &quot;T. aethiopicus&quot;. This was generally accepted by the scientific community until Lowe and Richards&#x27;s assessment of plumage in 1991. They again recommended the recognition of &quot;molucca&quot; at species level. This was followed by a chromosome study, which highlighted each of the three species having a different karyotype. The Australian white ibis has been considered a full species by most authorities since then.

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;T. m. molucca&quot; of eastern Malesia and Australia, is the nominate subspecies.
* &quot;T. m. pygmaeus&quot; (Solomons white ibis), known locally as the &quot;tagoa&quot;, is a dwarf form found on the Solomon Islands that has been considered a separate species (as &quot;Threskiornis pygmaeus&quot;) at times. It is found only on Rennell and Bellona Islands, in the Solomon Islands of Melanesia, in the south-west Pacific Ocean.

==Description==

The Australian white ibis is a fairly large ibis species, around long and has a bald black head and neck and a long black downcurved beak, measuring over in the male, and under in the female. There is some sexual dimorphism in size, as the slightly heavier male weighs compared to the female. As a comparison, the American white ibis generally attains in weight. The body plumage is white, although it may become brown-stained. Inner secondary plumes are displayed as lacy black &quot;tail&quot; feathers. The upper tail becomes yellow when the bird is breeding. The legs and feet are dark and red skin is visible on the underside of the wing. Immature birds have shorter bills. The head and neck are feathered in juveniles.
The call is a long croak.

The Australian white ibis reaches sexual maturity in three years, and can reach twenty-eight years of age.

==Distribution==

The Australian white ibis is widespread in eastern, northern and south-western Australia. It occurs in marshy wetlands, often near open grasslands and has become common in Australian east-coast city parks and rubbish dumps in the urban areas of Wollongong, Sydney, Perth, the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Townsville. Historically, it was rare in urban areas – the first visits were noted after drought drove birds eastwards in the late 1970s, and there were no breeding records in Sydney until the 1980s.

The Macquarie Marshes in north-western New South Wales used to be one of the main breeding areas of the bird, with 11,000 nests reported in 1998. However, since 2000, none have been reported breeding there. The species is absent from Tasmania.

===Urban population===
The species has been able to colonise urban areas by reducing its fear response when in close proximity to humans, and by significantly widening its suite of food items to include human refuse – strategies that other closely related species such as the straw-necked ibis and the spoonbills have not replicated.

Questions surrounding the origins of recent highly urbanised and closely human-habituated populations of the species are complicated by the establishment of free-flying exhibit flocks of formerly captive birds at a number of zoos and wildlife parks, including Sydney&#x27;s Taronga Zoo, which first acquired birds for this purpose around 1971. A 1973 ABC TV report noted Taronga&#x27;s by then well-established &quot;liberty flock&quot; was breeding locally, unlike natural populations, which at that time were only known to fleetingly visit the urban area and not breed there.

The resident Taronga flock nested in exotic Canary Island date palms, and was notably very closely habituated to people; approaching them at close quarters, feeding from rubbish bins and scavenging food from outdoor dining areas. These previously undocumented behaviours became closely associated with the urban Sydney flocks that emerged from around 1980 onwards, directly across the harbour in the Royal Botanic Gardens and the Sydney CBD, and further afield in the Centennial Parklands.

The relationship between birds originating from the Taronga flock and any influx of inland birds into Sydney is poorly known, but it is speculated that human-habituated flocks originating from the zoo may have encouraged some visiting flocks to stay in Sydney, with the two populations likely merging to some degree. Resident Sydney birds may have influenced newcomers fleeing from inland drought to adapt to new food sources in the city and to accept close proximity to humans.

Other free-flying exhibit populations were similarly established at Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria and at Tidbinbilla in the ACT, both of which mirrored the Taronga example by appearing to serve as population nucleation points. Healesville birds also seeded a free-flying population at Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary in Queensland.

The urban population further increased after a further period of inland drought in 1998. The first big colony set up in the Sydney suburb of Bankstown and started to cause anxiety in the local community. It is estimated the colony was the largest outside the Macquarie Marshes, their natural breeding wetland in inland NSW.

==Invasiveness==

There has been debate in recent years over whether to consider them a pest or a possibly endangered species. Birds in tourist areas of Sydney, such as Darling Harbour, the Royal Botanic Gardens, and Centennial Park, have been a problem due to their strong smell. Populations in the last two areas have been culled.

The birds have also come to be regarded as a problem species in Victoria as a result of their scavenging activities, scattering rubbish from tips and bins in the process, and earning the widespread nickname &quot;bin chicken&quot;. They are even known to snatch sandwiches from picnickers. Such behaviour, together with their propensity to build nests in &quot;inappropriate&quot; places, and competition with captive animals, led to surplus birds being relocated from Healesville Sanctuary to Sale. However, the birds returned in a few days.

They are a protected species in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===
The Australian white ibis&#x27; range of food includes both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and human scraps. The most favoured foods are crayfish and mussels, which the bird obtains by digging with its long bill. Ibises have also been observed to eat cane toads by &quot;flicking&quot; them about to make them secrete their defensive toxin, then washing the toad in a nearby water source before consuming it. Researchers called this a learned behaviour &quot;observed in multiple different regions&quot;. Although scientists do not think that the toxin affects most birds, they believe birds avoid it because of its &quot;awful&quot; taste.

===Breeding===
Breeding season varies with the location within Australia, generally August to November in the south, and February to May, after the wet season, in the north. The nest is a shallow dish-shaped platform of sticks, grasses or reeds, located in trees, generally near a body of water such as a river, swamp or lake. Ibises commonly nest near other waterbirds such as egrets, herons, spoonbills or cormorants. Two to three dull white eggs are laid measuring . The clutch is then incubated for 21–23 days. Hatchlings are altricial, that is, they are naked and helpless at birth, and take 48 days to fledge. The mating patterns were extensively studied by Lowe, Beilharz and Evans on a wild population at Healesville Sanctuary, where they found that some birds were selecting the same nesting partner within and between years whilst others changed partners regularly. There were also many between-pair copulations. 

===In the Solomon Islands===
The ibis is fairly common and is seen in groups of up to 30 birds along roads, on beaches and in the forest. It also visits villages where it forages with the domestic chickens. It feeds on the ground on invertebrates. When breeding, it nests in small colonies in forest trees and on islands in Lake Tegano.

==In culture==

The ibis has become a popular symbol of Australian identity, and has been depicted on television, in art, and in online memes. In March 2021, the Macquarie Dictionary blog chose &quot;bin chicken&quot; as an Australian word of the week, and wrote that it was potentially &quot;competing with the kangaroo for the position of most iconic Australian animal&quot;. In 1989, the Municipality of Hunter&#x27;s Hill on Sydney Harbour adopted a coat of arms granted by the College of Arms which featured two ibis birds as supporters.

In December 2017, the ibis placed second in &quot;Guardian Australia&quot; inaugural Bird of the Year poll, a nationwide competition for Australia&#x27;s favourite native bird. The ibis led the poll for much of the voting, but lost to the magpie by 843 votes (19,926 votes to 19,083).

In April 2022, Queensland sports minister Stirling Hinchliffe suggested the ibis as a potential mascot for the 2032 Olympic Games which are scheduled to be held in Brisbane.

<text>The Hollywood Bowl is an amphitheatre and public park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, California. It was named one of the 10 best live music venues in the United States by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2018 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2023.

The Hollywood Bowl is known for its distinctive bandshell, originally a set of concentric arches that graced the site from 1929 through 2003, before being replaced with a larger one to begin the 2004 season. The shell is set against the backdrop of the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood Sign to the northeast.

The &quot;bowl&quot; refers to the shape of the concave meadow or dell, originally called Daisy Dell, into which the amphitheatre is carved. The Bowl is owned by the County of Los Angeles and is the home of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, the summer home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the host venue for hundreds of musical events each year.

Located on North Highland Avenue, it is north of Hollywood Boulevard and approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) from the Hollywood/Highland Metro Rail station. It is adjacent to U.S. Route 101.

==History==

===Siting and opening===
The site of the Hollywood Bowl was chosen in 1919 by William Reed and his son H. Ellis Reed, who were dispatched to find a suitable location for outdoor performances by the members of the newly formed Theatre Arts Alliance, headed by Christine Wetherill Stevenson. The Reeds selected a natural theater, a shaded canyon and popular picnic spot known as Daisy Dell in Bolton Canyon, which was chosen for its natural acoustics and its proximity to downtown Hollywood. The Community Park and Art Association, then headed by F. W. Blanchard, was the first organization to begin building the Bowl.

One of the earliest performances at the Bowl was Hollywood High School&#x27;s Performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. The Women&#x27;s World Peace Concert was held on November 11, 1921. On November 11, 1921, the first Sunrise Service took place at the bowl, in one of its first major events. With the building of the first actual stage, consisting of little more than wooden platforms and canvas, The Bowl officially opened on July 11, 1922.

=== Community function ===
The Bowl began as a community space rather than a privately owned establishment. Proceeds from the early events at the Bowl went to financing the construction of new elements of the bowl such as a stage and seating in 1922 and 1923 respectively. In 1924, a backdrop to the stage was added.

During the early years of the Bowl&#x27;s existence, concert tickets were kept at the lowest available price of 25 cents using the slogan &quot;popular prices will prevail&quot;, coined by F.W. Blanchard. While serving as the venue for concerts by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Bowl also served as a community space, used for Easter services, the Hollywood Community Chorus, as well as &quot;Young Artists Nights&quot; where younger musicians could perform well-known classical music. Children were also invited to perform at community events with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Hollywood Community Chorus, beginning with Sibelius’ &quot;Finlandia&quot; in 1921.

The Bowl hosted a variety of Native American tribal events, as well as international music ensembles. 

In 1924, the land was deeded to the County of Los Angeles.

=== Women in the Bowl ===
Many of the key influential figures in the founding of the Hollywood Bowl were women, most notably the pianist Artie Mason Carter, whose connections with the Los Angeles arts patrons were vital in the early days of the Bowl&#x27;s existence. Christine Wetherill Stevenson and Marie Rankin Clarke both donated $21,000 to purchase the land on which the bowl was built. E.J. Wakeman, Leiland Atherton Irish, Harriet Clay Penman, and composers Gertrude Ross and Carrie Jacobs Bond all contributed to the Bowl through fundraising drives.

===Band shells===


Frank Lloyd Wright, Jr. (commonly known as Lloyd Wright) designed the second and third band shells. The original 1926 shell, designed by the Allied Architects Association, was considered unacceptable both visually and acoustically. Wright&#x27;s 1927 shell had a pyramidal shape and a design reminiscent of southwest American Indian architecture. Its acoustics generally were regarded as the best of any shell in Bowl history. But its appearance was considered too avant-garde, or even ugly, and it was demolished at the end of the season. His 1928 wooden shell had the now-familiar concentric ring motif, covered a 120-degree arc, and was designed to be easily dismantled. Unfortunately it was neglected and ruined by water damage.

For the 1929 season, the Allied Architects built the shell that stood until 2003, using a transite skin over a metal frame. Its acoustics, though not nearly as good as those of the Lloyd Wright shells, were deemed satisfactory at first, and its clean lines and white, semicircular arches were copied for music shells elsewhere. As the acoustics deteriorated, various measures were used to mitigate the problems, starting in the 1970s with an inner shell made from large cardboard tubes, which were replaced in the early 1980s by large fiberglass spheres (both designed by Frank Gehry) that remained until 2003.

These dampened the unfavorable acoustics, but required massive use of electronic amplification to reach the full audience, particularly since the background noise level had risen sharply since the 1920s. The appearance underwent other visual changes as well, including the addition of a broad outer arch (forming a proscenium) where it had once had only a narrow rim, and a reflecting pool in front of the stage that lasted from 1953 till 1972. Sculptor George Stanley, designer of the Oscar statuette, designed the Muse Fountain which has stood outside the Hollywood Bowl&#x27;s main entrance since 1940.
Shortly after the end of the 2003 summer season, the 1929 shell was replaced with a new, somewhat larger, acoustically improved shell, which had its debut in the 2004 summer season. Preservationists fiercely opposed the demolition for many years, citing the shell&#x27;s storied history. However, even when it was built, the 1929 shell was (at least acoustically) only the third-best shell in the Bowl&#x27;s history, behind its two immediate predecessors. By the late 1970s, the Hollywood Bowl became an acoustic liability because of continued hardening of its transite skin. The new shell incorporates design elements of not only the 1929 shell, but of both the Lloyd Wright shells. During the 2004 summer season, the sound steadily improved, as engineers learned to work with its live acoustics.

The current sound reinforcement system is a line-array configuration of multiple loudspeaker enclosures hung vertically in a curved manner, with the lower enclosures facing the front sections, and the upper enclosures angled towards the rear sections. It is manufactured by L&#x27;Acoustics, and includes state-of-the-art audio processing, allowing each individual loudspeaker enclosure to be &quot;tuned&quot; and directed towards the near-precise location of the listener, regardless of where in the venue they are sitting. This results in the audience in the rear sections hearing the same audio, at the same level, as in the front sections.

This electronic processing includes sound level, frequency equalization, occasional special effects, and time delay. Sound passes through wire much faster than through air, therefore the sound coming from the speakers must be delayed, allowing the actual sound from the stage to &quot;catch up&quot; so both sources reach the listeners&#x27; ears simultaneously. The system is maintained by Rat Sound Systems, the same company that has provided audio for the Coachella Festival, since its inception.

The 2004 shell incorporates the prominent front arch of the 1926 shell, the broad profile of the 1928 shell, and the unadorned white finish (and most of the general lines) of the 1929 shell. In addition, the ring-shaped structure hung within the shell, supporting lights and acoustic clouds, echoes a somewhat similar structure hung within the 1927 shell. During the 2004 season, because the back wall was not yet finished, a white curtain was hung at the back; beginning with the 2005 season, the curtain was removed to reveal a finished back wall. The architectural design for the shell was developed by the Los Angeles-based architectural practice Hodgetts and Fung, with the structural concept developed by the local office of Arup.

At the same time the new shell was being constructed the bowl received four new video screens and towers. During most concerts, three remotely-operated cameras in the shell, and a fourth, manually-operated camera among the box seats, provide the audience with close-up views of the musicians.

== Hollywood Bowl Orchestra(s) ==
The Hollywood Bowl has had several house orchestras. A &quot;Bowl Orchestra&quot; performed in 1925, and a &quot;Hollywood Bowl Orchestra&quot; made a live recording in 1928. Later, the &quot;Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra&quot; made several classical recordings under music director Leopold Stokowski from 1945 to 1946, and released a number of recordings on the Capitol Records label in the 1950s and 1960s.

The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra was re-launched by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association in 1991 under principal conductor John Mauceri, who finished his tenure in 2006.

===Early conductors===

The first appointed conductor of the Bowl ensemble was Emil Oberhoffer, who served for one year. Oberhoffer was proceeded by Alfred Hertz for two years. In 1925 Fritz Reiner migrated to the orchestra from the Cincinnati Symphony. Reiner was supplanted by Sir Henry Wood several years later.. German-born Frederick Stark, who would later become a music librarian at Walt Disney Studios, occasionally served as conductor.

== Early ballet and opera ==
Ballet dancer Maud Allen performed during the production of the &quot;Pathétique&quot; Symphony by Tschaikowsky under the direction of Alfred Hertz in 1926. Ernest Belcher arranged a ballet scene for &quot;Bowl Dedication Night,&quot; and dancers from the Belcher Ballet School performed the &quot;Beautiful Galatea,&quot; &quot;Enchanted Hour,&quot; and &quot;Venesive Festival&quot;. In 1932, the Belcher&#x27;s ballet was performed in Greek Costumes as a dedication to the Olympic-Games Athletes. Alexis and Theodore Kosloff performed the ballet &quot;Scheherazade&quot; with dancers from Hollywood and the Klosloff Dancing School. In 1932, Theodore Klosloff performed the &quot;Flower&quot;. Also in 1932, the ballet &quot;Chopiniana&quot; was performed.

Ballet Dancers Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn performed solo dances under direction of Hertz in 1927. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn raised their arms to point at the California Stars during the Russian Ballet &quot;sur le point&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl. In 1928, Andreas Pavley, a tenor, and Serge Oukrainsky, a ballet dancer, performed at the Hollywood Bowl. Oukrainsky performed in the ballet &quot;La Fete a Robinson&quot; alone after Pavley&#x27;s death. In 1929, Norma Gould brought her Los Angeles dancers to the bowl to perform during Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot; and Tschaikowsky&#x27;s &quot;Nut-Cracker Suite&quot;. In August 1930, Michio Ito brought five dancers to the Hollywood Bowl to perform in the Russian Ballet &quot;Prince Igor&quot;. In 1931, Adolph Bolm performed at the Bowl for Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Les Nuages&quot;. He also performed &quot;The Spirt factory&quot;. This was later called the Mechanical Ballet, composed by Alaxander Mosolov. Dancers Elise Reiman and Robert Bell also performed in the Mechanical Ballet.

In 1931, Los Angeles Grand Opera performed segments of &quot;Marouf&quot;. Early Hollywood Bowl appearances of opera include &quot;Carmen,&quot; &quot;Aida&quot;, and &quot;Shanewis&quot;. In 1929, a concertized form of the opera &quot;Carmen&quot; was performed by Alice Genytle, Paul Althouse and Alexander Kisselburgh. The same cast later performed moments from the opera &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. In 1932, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; was performed by Paul Althouse, local singers, the Belcher Ballet and the Civic Chorus in concert style. In 1927, Elsa Alsen performed &quot;Santuzza&quot; in &quot;Cavalleria&quot;.

In 1934, Nina Koshetz performed Carmen and Nelson Eddy sang Escamillo in the opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. Koshetz also sang the lead in Tschaikowsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. In the 1930s, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; was performed by Dan Gridley, Clemence Gifford, Eleanor Woodforde and Richard Bonelli with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1935, &quot;Lohengrin&quot; was performed, with Jeanette Vreeland performing Elsa and Dan Gridley performing Lonhengrin.

==Performances==

The first season at the Hollywood Bowl began on July 11, 1922, with conductor Alfred Hertz and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 

In 1945, Leopold Stokowski formed the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra, drawing its players from among members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and various film studios orchestras. He made a number of 78 rpm recordings with them for RCA Victor during his two seasons there (1945–46) before returning to New York. The Hollywood Bowl Symphony&#x27;s name was retained for a series of Capitol LPs made in the 1950s under such conductors as Felix Slatkin and Carmen Dragon.

In 1951, a financial crisis closed the Hollywood Bowl during its summer season. Dorothy Chandler chaired a committee that organized a series of fundraising concerts that was able to reopen it.

The film-and-orchestra concert Bugs Bunny on Broadway, subsequently called &quot;Bugs Bunny at the Symphony,&quot; has played the Hollywood Bowl a record 21 times—19 times with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and twice with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, all conducted by George Daugherty. In September 2003, &quot;Bugs Bunny On Broadway&quot; was the final Los Angeles Philharmonic concert to be performed in the 1929 shell before its demolition started the following day, making way for the new shell.

== Hollywood Bowl green initiatives ==

The Hollywood Bowl is the first amphitheater in California to be certified as an Audubon Society Cooperative Sanctuary. Los Angeles Philharmonic Association and Los Angeles County are partners with the Hollywood Bowl and encourage recycling. The Hollywood Bowl has many recycling bins located throughout the venue. The Hollywood Bowl has also partnered with Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (formerly Southern California Rapid Transit District) since 1953 and provides the public with green alternatives to driving, including shuttle buses. &quot;Know Before You Go&quot; is provided as a detailed guide offering public transport information and free bike parking options. The Hollywood Bowl has waterless urinals and flush-reducing toilets to preserve water as well as a satellite-based irrigation system to control water use. This irrigation system also provides water based on the needs of animal life. The Hollywood Bowl has stainless steel grates and water filters to keep its irrigation system clean.

In 2024, the Hollywood Bowl reduced on-site parking and introduced a rideshare parking lot. Parking fees were increased and more shuttles offered. 

== In popular culture ==
The Vinewood Bowl, which appears in the 2013 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, is heavily inspired by the Hollywood Bowl.

Many films and television shows have been filmed in the Hollywood Bowl, including &quot;Jazz Mad&quot;, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, and more.

Several Looney Tunes episodes, including &quot;Long Haired Hare&quot;, &quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot;, &quot;Baton Bunny&quot;, and &quot;Tom and Jerry in the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, feature the Hollywood Bowl.

<text>Diah Permata Megawati Setiawati Sukarnoputri (; born 23 January 1947) is an Indonesian politician who served as the fifth president of Indonesia from 2001 to 2004 and the eighth vice president under President Abdurrahman Wahid from 1999 to 2001. She is Indonesia&#x27;s first and only female president to date in a Muslim-majority country. She is also head of a party called Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle that lost during the 2024 Indonesian local elections. 

Megawati Sukarnoputri became president when Abdurrahman Wahid was removed from office in 2001. She ran for re-election in the 2004 presidential election, but was defeated by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and ran again in the 2009 presidential election, losing to Yudhoyono a second time. She is the first and current leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), one of Indonesia&#x27;s largest political parties. She is the eldest daughter of Indonesia&#x27;s first president, Sukarno.

==Name==
Megawati&#x27;s last name (&quot;Sukarnoputri&quot;, meaning &quot;daughter of Sukarno&quot;) is a patronym, not a family name. Javanese often do not have family names, similarly Minang living outside of traditional nagari society often do not carry on matrilineal clan names. She is often referred to as simply &quot;Megawati&quot; or &quot;Mega&quot;, derived from Sanskrit meaning &#x27;cloud goddess.&#x27; In a speech to the students of the Sri Sathya Sai Primary School, she mentioned that Indian politician Biju Patnaik named her at Sukarno&#x27;s request.

==Early life and education==
===Early life and family===

Megawati Sukarnoputri was born in Yogyakarta to Sukarno, who had declared Indonesia&#x27;s independence from the Netherlands 2 years prior in 1945 and Fatmawati, a Minang descended from Inderapuran aristocracy, one of his nine wives. Megawati Sukarnoputri was Sukarno&#x27;s second child and second daughter. She grew up in her father&#x27;s Merdeka Palace. She danced for her father&#x27;s guests and developed a gardening hobby. Megawati Sukarnoputri was 19 when her father relinquished power in 1966 and was succeeded by a government which eventually came to be led by President Suharto.

===Education===
Megawati Sukarnoputri attended Padjadjaran University in Bandung to study agriculture but dropped out in 1967 to be with her father following his fall. In 1970, the year her father died, Megawati Sukarnoputri went to the University of Indonesia to study psychology but dropped out after two years.

==Political career==
===Member of parliament===

In 1986, Suharto gave the status of Proclamation Hero to Sukarno in a ceremony attended by Megawati Sukarnoputri. Suharto&#x27;s acknowledgment enabled the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), a government-sanctioned party, to campaign on Sukarno nostalgia in the lead-up to the 1987 legislative elections. Up to that time, Megawati Sukarnoputri had seen herself as a housewife, but in 1987 she joined PDI and ran for a People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) seat. The PDI accepted Megawati Sukarnoputri to boost their own image. Megawati Sukarnoputri quickly became popular, her status as Sukarno&#x27;s daughter offsetting her lack of oratorical skills. Although PDI came last in the elections, Megawati Sukarnoputri was elected to the DPR. Like all members of the DPR she also became a member of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR).

===Indonesian Democratic Party chair===

Megawati Sukarnoputri was not reelected, but continued as a PDI member. In December 1993, the PDI held a national congress. As was always the case when New Order opposition parties held their congresses, the government actively interfered. As the Congress approached, three individuals contended for the PDI chair. The incumbent, Suryadi, had become critical of the government. The second was Budi Harjono a government-friendly figure whom the government backed. The third was Megawati Sukarnoputri. Her candidacy received such overwhelming support that her election at the Congress became a formality.

When the congress assembled, the government stalled and delayed attempts to hold the election. The congress faced a deadline when their permit to assemble would run out. As the hours ticked down to the end of the congress, troops began gathering. With only two hours remaining, Megawati Sukarnoputri called a press conference, stating that because she enjoyed the support of a majority of PDI members, she was now the de facto chair. Despite her relative lack of political experience, she was popular in part for her status as Sukarno&#x27;s daughter and because she was seen as free of corruption with admirable personal qualities. Under her leadership, PDI gained a large following among the urban poor and both urban and rural middle classes.

===Split in the party===
The government was outraged at its failure to prevent Megawati&#x27;s rise. They never acknowledged Megawati Sukarnoputri although her self-appointment was ratified in 1994. In 1996, the government convened a special national congress in Medan that reelected Suryadi as chair. Megawati Sukarnoputri and her camp refused to acknowledge the results and the PDI divided into pro-Megawati and anti-Megawati camps.

====27 July 1996 incident====
Suryadi began threatening to take back PDI&#x27;s Headquarters in Jakarta. This threat was carried on the morning of 27 July 1996. Suryadi&#x27;s supporters (reportedly with the government&#x27;s backing) attacked PDI Headquarters and faced resistance from Megawati Sukarnoputri supporters stationed there. In the ensuing fight, Megawati&#x27;s supporters held on to the headquarters. A riot ensued, followed by a government crackdown. The government later blamed the riots on the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PRD), and continued to recognize Suryadi&#x27;s faction as the official party.

====1997 legislative election====
Despite what seemed to be a political defeat, Megawati Sukarnoputri scored a moral victory and her popularity grew. When the time came for the 1997 legislative election, Megawati Sukarnoputri and her supporters threw their support behind the United Development Party (PPP), the other approved opposition party.

===&quot;Reformasi&quot; era===
====1999 legislative election====

In mid-1997, Indonesia began to be affected by the Asian Financial Crisis and showed severe economic distress. By late January 1998 the rupiah fell to nearly 15,000 against the US dollar, compared to only 4,000 in early December. Increasing public anger at pervasive corruption culminated with Suharto&#x27;s resignation and the assumption of the presidency by Vice President B. J. Habibie in May 1998, starting the Reformation era (&quot;Reformasi&quot;). The restrictions on Megawati Sukarnoputri were removed and she began to consolidate her political position. In October 1998, her supporters held a National Congress whereby Megawati&#x27;s PDI faction would now be known as the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P). Megawati Sukarnoputri was elected chair and was nominated as PDI-P&#x27;s presidential candidate.

PDI-P, together with Abdurrahman Wahid&#x27;s National Awakening Party (PKB) and Amien Rais&#x27; National Mandate Party (PAN), became the leading reform forces. Despite their popularity, Megawati Sukarnoputri, Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais adopted a moderate stance, preferring to wait until the 1999 legislative election to begin major changes. In November 1998, Megawati Sukarnoputri, together with Abdurrahman Wahid, Amien Rais and Hamengkubuwono X reiterated their commitment to reform through the Ciganjur Statement.

====Result and aftermath====
As the elections approached, Megawati Sukarnoputri, Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais considered forming a political coalition against President Habibie and Golkar. In May, Alwi Shihab held a press conference at his house during which Megawati Sukarnoputri, Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais were to announce that they would work together. At the last minute, Megawati Sukarnoputri chose not to attend, because she decided that she could not trust Amien. In June, the elections were held and PDI-P came first with 33% of the votes.

With the victory, Megawati&#x27;s presidential prospects solidified. She was opposed by PPP who did not want a female president. In preparation for the 1999 MPR General Session, PDI-P formed a loose coalition with PKB. As the MPR General Session approached, it seemed as if the presidential election would be contested between Megawati Sukarnoputri and B. J. Habibie, but by late June Amien Rais had drawn the Islamic parties into a coalition called the Central Axis. The presidential election became a three-way race when Amien Rais floated the idea of nominating Wahid for president; but Abdurrahman Wahid did not provide a clear response to the proposal.

===1999 indirect presidential election===

====Election of Wahid as president====
Megawati&#x27;s PDI-P and PKB coalition faced its first test when the MPR assembled to choose its chair. Megawati Sukarnoputri threw her support behind Matori Abdul Djalil, the Chair of PKB. He was overwhelmingly defeated by Amien Rais, who in addition to enjoying Central Axis support was backed by Golkar. The Golkar and Central Axis coalition struck again when they secured Akbar Tandjung&#x27;s election as Head of DPR. At this stage, people became wary that Megawati Sukarnoputri, who best represented reform, was going to be obstructed by the political process and that the status quo was going to be preserved. PDI-P supporters began to gather in Jakarta.

B. J. Habibie made a poorly received speech on political accountability that led him to withdraw. The presidential election held on 20 October 1999 came down to Megawati Sukarnoputri and Abdurrahman Wahid. Megawati Sukarnoputri took an early lead, but was overtaken and lost with 313 votes compared to Wahid&#x27;s 373. Megawati&#x27;s loss provoked her supporters to revolt. Riots raged in Java and Bali. In the city of Solo, PDI-P masses attacked Amien&#x27;s house.

====Selection as vice president====
The next day, the MPR assembled to elect the vice president. PDI-P had considered nominating Megawati Sukarnoputri, but were concerned that the Central Axis and Golkar coalition would again thwart her. Instead, PKB nominated Megawati Sukarnoputri. She faced stiff competition from Hamzah Haz, Akbar Tandjung, and General Wiranto. Well aware of the riots, Akbar Tandjung and Wiranto withdrew. Hamzah Haz stayed in the race, but Megawati defeated him 396 to 284. In her inauguration speech, she called for calm.

==Vice presidency (1999–2001)==
===Tenure===
As vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri had considerable authority by virtue of her commanding many seats in the DPR. Abdurrahman Wahid delegated to her the problems in Ambon, although she was not successful. By the time the MPR Annual Session assembled in August 2000, many considered Abdurrahman Wahid to be ineffective as president or as an administrator. Abdurrahman Wahid responded to this by issuing a presidential decree, giving Megawati Sukarnoputri day-to-day control of the government.

===2000 PDI-P National Congress===

The First PDI-P Congress was held in Semarang, Central Java, in April 2000, at which Megawati Sukarnoputri was re-elected as chair for a second term.

Megawati Sukarnoputri consolidated her position within PDI-P by taking harsh measures to remove potential rivals. During the election for the chair, two other candidates emerged; Eros Djarot and Dimyati Hartono. They ran because they did not want Megawati Sukarnoputri to serve concurrently as both chair and vice president. Eros&#x27; nomination from the South Jakarta branch was voided by membership problems. Eros was not allowed to participate in the Congress. Disillusioned with what he perceived to be a cult of personality developing around Megawati, Eros left PDI-P. In July 2002, he formed the Freedom Bull National Party. Although Dimyati&#x27;s candidacy was not opposed as harshly as Eros, he was removed as Head of PDI-P&#x27;s Central Branch. He kept his position as a People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) member, but left the party to become a university lecturer. In April 2002, Dimyati formed the Our Homeland of Indonesia Party (PITA).

===Rise to the presidency===

Megawati Sukarnoputri had an ambivalent relationship with Abdurrahman Wahid. During the cabinet reshuffle of August 2000 for example, Megawati was not present for the announcement of the new line-up. At another occasion, when the political tide began to turn against Abdurrahman Wahid, Megawati Sukarnoputri defended him and lashed out against critics. In 2001, Megawati Sukarnoputri began to distance herself from Abdurrahman Wahid as a Special Session of the MPR approached and her prospects of becoming president improved. Although she refused to make any specific comments, she showed signs of preparing herself, holding a meeting with party leaders a day before the Special Session was to start.

==Presidency (2001–2004)==

===Tenure===
On 23 July 2001, the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) removed Wahid from office and subsequently swore in Megawati Sukarnoputri as the new president. She thus became the sixth woman to lead a Muslim-majority country. On 10 August 2001, she announced her Mutual Assistance Cabinet.
The rise of an icon of opposition against the Suharto regime to the presidency was initially widely welcomed, however it soon became apparent that her presidency was marked with indecisiveness, lack of clear ideological direction, and &quot;a reputation for inaction on important policy issues&quot;. The good side of slow progress of reforms and avoiding confrontations was that she stabilized the overall democratization process and relationship between legislative, executive, and military.

===Political and legal arrangements===
Reforms conducted from Abdurrahman Wahid&#x27;s presidency has become Megawati&#x27;s important agenda in restoring political stability and democracy. In doing so, her administration passed 2 more constitutional amendments with the third amendment being held on 10 November 2001 and the fourth amendment held on 1–11 August 2002. These amendments contributed to the formation of the Constitutional Court and the dissolution of the Supreme Advisory Council. As a contribution to these amendments, her government has drafted many laws that will fulfill the mandate of the amendments made to the Indonesian Constitution, especially in the areas of regional government, political parties, and general elections.

Megawati Sukarnoputri also established the first general election system, where the Indonesian people can directly elect the president and vice president, in addition to electing legislative candidates. As a result, she was given the title &quot;Mother of Upholding the Constitution&quot;.

Megawati Sukarnoputri also played an important role in the formation of the Corruption Eradication Commission, an institution tasked with eradicating corruption in Indonesia. In eradicating the rampant corruption inherited from the New Order, she formed the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). The formation of the KPK was based on Megawati&#x27;s view that many legal institutions at that time were not clean, so the KPK needed to be formed. Long before that, the initial idea for forming the Corruption Eradication Committee emerged in the era of President BJ Habibie who issued Law Number 28 of 1999 concerning State Administration that was clean and free from corruption, collusion and nepotism.

Home Affairs Minister Hari Sabarno outlined her administration&#x27;s focus on decentralization, where the implementation of regional autonomy is carried out fairly to give authority to regions to manage their own regions while maintaining national unity and integrity. In guiding such autonomy and to preserve national unity, her government implements regional autonomy policies that are proportional and consistent, implementing fair financial balance, increasing the distribution of easily accessible public services, correcting gaps in economic development and regional income, and respects regional cultural values based on the mandate of the amendment to the Constitution.

===Military===
The Indonesian National Armed Forces has undergone changes in order to suit their new roles in the democratic administration to be a military force that is more dynamic, ever-ready and flexible to changes. This is specified by Megawati on the following quote:

One of the roles of the TNI in the democratic political system carried out by President Megawati was also specifically deciding to transfer the authority to carry out security operations in Maluku from the hands of the Police to the hands of the TNI which proved effective in restoring stability in 2002. President Megawati also revived the Iskandar Muda Regional Military Command in February 2002.

She passed Law No. 3 2002 on National Defense which outlines huge changes to the military. The policy stated in the law then became the forerunner of the definitions, goals, roles, targets and implementation of Indonesia&#x27;s defenses. Apart from making Indonesia a safe country for its people and build peace with, the defense policy also includes Indonesia&#x27;s geographical aspects as an archipelagic country as a consideration to make preparations on national defense. In this policy, the Indonesian National Armed Forces is placed as the main defense component, supported by reserves and supporting components. Megawati also involved non-governmental organizations to assist the military in non-military threats. In 2002, she prepared a budget of IDR 7,5 billion for TNI/POLRI&#x27;s welfare programs which includes housing for personnels of each branch and facility improvements. 

Internationally, the military was hit by an arms embargo imposed by the United States and US President Bill Clinton accused Indonesia of conducting human rights violation in East Timor. The embargo affected Indonesia&#x27;s ability to purchase spare parts for strategic arsenals such as F-16 Fighting Falcon and Northrop F-5 owned by the Indonesian Air Force and reduced combat readiness of all Indonesian military units down to 50%. As a result, Megawati turned to Russia for military cooperation, resulting in the acquisition of military equipment such as Sukhoi Su-27 fighters and Mil Mi-35 attack helicopters in order to effectively defend Indonesia from external threats. 

====2003 Aceh offensive====

On 19 May 2003, in response of GAM refusal of the Tokyo peace deal which planned to end the decades long insurgency in Aceh, Megawati gave the 12th Indonesian Military Chief General Endriartono Sutarto, permission to commence military operations against the GAM separatist. General Sutarto also imposed martial law in Aceh for a period of six months and the Indonesian government subsequently deployed 1,500 soldiers and 12,000 police to the province. During the military operation, government forces would conduct numerous human rights abuses including torture, rape, forced disappearances, and murder. An estimated 1,159 rebels died with 147 civilians were killed and 155 wounded during the operation.

===Economic arrangement===
Since her inauguration, Megawati&#x27;s administration strive to provide conditions that conducive to rebuilding the economy that has been in ruins ever since the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the political crisis since Suharto&#x27;s fall between 1998 and 2001. During the early periods of her administration, Indonesia has US$105.8 billion in debt which was inherited from Suharto&#x27;s regime. As president, she attended Paris Club and London Club meetings in an attempt to renegotiate Indonesia&#x27;s outstanding debts which result in Megawati able to delay the payments of US$5.8 billion of debts in a Paris Club meeting in 12 April 2002 and prepared a debt payment of Rp.116.3 billion on 2003. 

Her administration is widely known for privatizations of state owned enterprises (SOE). According to Megawati, the privatization of SOEs is done to defend SOEs from public intervention and debt payments, to increase efficiency and competitiveness of the SOEs and to speed up economic growth from the private sector. Numerous state enterprises such as Semen Gresik, Bank Negara Indonesia, Kimia Farma and most controversially, Indosat were privatized. In her own journal, Megawati&#x27;s privatization drive has successfully increased economic growth by 4.1% and suppressed inflation by 5.06%. However, her privatization on SOEs especially on Indosat generated criticisms and Megawati was accused as a neoliberal. 

Megawati restored cooperative relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has been delayed during Wahid&#x27;s presidency by tasking Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti, Minister of Finance Boediono and Governor of Bank Indonesia Burhanuddin Abdullah to fulfill 20 letters of intent from the IMF and World Bank which affects with the disbursement of an IMF loan of around SDR 400 million to strengthen the position of foreign exchange reserves for each LOI received. The partnership itself ends in 2003 due to her criticisms on IMF and World Bank&#x27;s &quot;confusing&quot; suggestions in recovering Indonesia&#x27;s economy.

One of her national development focus and leading sector is Indonesia&#x27;s marine and fisheries economy. On 7 June 2003, Megawati on board KRI &quot;Tanjung Dalpele&quot; launched the National Movement for Maritime and Fisheries Development (GERBANG MINA BAHARI). In essence, the movement establishes the Maritime and Fisheries sector, Maritime Tourism, Maritime Industry and Services, and Maritime Transportation as the prime mover of national economic development. Simultaneously, other development sectors and political-economic policies support these prime mover sectors. Meanwhile, the basis of Maritime and Fisheries development is Sustainable Development, namely harmonizing efforts to increase economic growth, equal distribution of welfare and environmental preservation.

===Domestic issues===
Under Megawati, Indonesia reaffirmed its presence in Papua and positioned itself as the central government and ensured that the doctrine of independence and the ideas of freedom and self-determination did not emerge. Under the Megawati’s administration, West Papuan independence activist Theys Eluay was assassinated. Megawati’s government also postponed the implementing regulations for the establishment of the Papuan People’s Assembly (Majelis Rakyat Papua), and favored the issuance of a presidential decree to implement Law No. 45/1999 to divide Papua into three distinct provinces.

===Environment===
In 2003, Megawati launched a reforestation program in the form of the National Movement for Forest and Terrain Rehabilitation (GERHAN). This program aimed to address the need for rehabilitation of degraded areas which are increasing in size and the destruction of forests and land that has occurred. According to Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Rokhmin Dahuri, Megawati has long loved plants. Rokhmin said that her personal hobby has also made Megawati to be more aware and concerned about policies related to environmental conservation. 

===2004 general election===

Incumbent president Megawati Sukarnoputri was the PDI-P&#x27;s top nominee, seeking to become the first woman elected in her own right as president of a Muslim-majority country. She was joined by vice-presidential candidate Hasyim Muzadi, general chairman of Indonesia&#x27;s largest Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). The pair was assigned the number 2 for its ballot. However, she was decisively defeated by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in the second round, by 61 percent to 39 percent, on 20 September 2004. She did not attend the new president&#x27;s inauguration and never congratulated him.

==Post-presidency==
===Leader of the PDI-P===
====2009 general election====

On 11 September 2007 Megawati Sukarnoputri announced her candidacy in the 2009 presidential election
at a PDI-P gathering. Soetardjo Soerjoguritno confirmed her willingness to be nominated as her party&#x27;s presidential candidate. Her nomination for president was announced on 15 May 2009, with Gerindra Party leader Prabowo Subianto as her running mate.

Megawati&#x27;s 2009 race was overshadowed by her calls to change Indonesia&#x27;s voter registration procedure, obliquely suggesting that Yudhoyono&#x27;s supporters were trying to manipulate the vote. Megawati Sukarnoputri and Prabowo Subianto lost the election to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, coming in second with 26.79% of the vote.

====2014 general election====
On 24 February 2012, Megawati Sukarnoputri distanced herself from polls that placed her as a top contender for the 2014 presidential election. As Chair of PDI-P, she appealed to her party at a gathering in Yogyakarta to focus on its current priorities. Nonetheless, a domain name appeared to have been registered in her name. On 27 December 2012, the daily edition of the &quot;Jakarta Post&quot; hinted at a possible reconciliation in the 2014 general election between the families of Megawati Sukarnoputri and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and their political parties, her PDI-P and his Democratic Party respectively.

For the 2014 general election, the PDI-P and their coalition partners nominated Joko Widodo as their candidate for president. Joko Widodo defeated his opponent Prabowo Subianto in a hotly contested election. Later, the relationship between Megawati Sukarnoputri and Joko Widodo became strained as she pushed for Police Commissary General Budi Gunawan for the post of the Indonesian Police Chief, despite him being investigated for corruption by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). Budi Gunawan was Megawati&#x27;s adjutant during her tenure as president. Megawati later criticize Jokowi&#x27;s decision, quipping him for not carrying out the party line of struggle, which resulted in a controversy. Budi Gunawan was eventually appointed as the Director of the State Intelligence Agency.

At the 4th PDI-P National Congress on 20 September 2014, Megawati Sukarnoputri was reappointed Chair of PDI-P for 2015-2020.

====2024 general election====

On 10 January 2024, during the 51st anniversary of PDI-P, Megawati Sukarnoputri made a speech about several strategic issues, such as neutrality of the authorities, democracy, elections and volunteers. She then gave a satirical speech for Joko Widodo, touching on the stigma of the role of volunteers in winning the presidential election and emphasizing that only parties have the authority to nominate president and vice president. At the end of her speech, Megawati Sukarnoputri said that she was confident that the presidential and vice-presidential candidates from her party coalition, Ganjar Pranowo and Mahfud MD, would win in just one round in the 2024 presidential election. She added that Ganjar Pranowo and Mahfud MD were energetic, intelligent and cared about the little people.

===Post-presidency appointments===

So far, Megawati Sukarnoputri is the only former president which somehow retained her influence within the government and even appointed to strategic positions with advisory capabilities. On 22 March 2018, she was appointed as Head of Steering Committee of Pancasila Ideology Development Agency. She also gained position as Head of National Research and Innovation Agency Steering Committee since 5 May 2021, and she was formally appointed on 13 September 2021.

===Other activities===
On 4 October 2023, Megawati Sukarnoputri had a meeting with former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Kuala Lumpur. During their discussion, the two senior politicians covered various topics, including Indonesia&#x27;s plan to relocate its capital city to East Kalimantan.

==Personal life==

Megawati&#x27;s first husband was First Lieutenant , whom she married on 1 June 1968. He perished in a plane crash in Biak, West Irian, on 22 January 1970. On 27 June 1972, she married Hassan Gamal Ahmad Hassan, an Egyptian diplomat. The marriage was annulled by the Religious Court less than 3 months later. She then married Taufiq Kiemas on 25 March 1973. He died on 8 June 2013. She has three children, Mohammad Rizki Pratama, Muhammad Prananda Prabowo, and Puan Maharani. The sons are from her marriage with Surindro, while Puan Maharani is the only child from Megawati&#x27;s marriage to Taufiq.

<text>Balaenicipitidae is a family of birds in the order Pelecaniformes, although it was traditionally placed in Ciconiiformes. The shoebill is the sole extant species and its closest relative is the hamerkop (&quot;Scopus umbretta&quot;), which belongs to another family. Species from the Ciconiiformes and Balaenicipitidae family have been found in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and parts of East Africa.

It has the following genera:

*&quot;Balaeniceps&quot;
*†&quot;Goliathia&quot; (might belong in &quot;Balaeniceps&quot;)
*†&quot;Paludiavis&quot;

== Common characteristics ==

* A sharp hooked tip to the upper beak
* A furrow in the upper beak below the nasal openings
* An ossified septum
* Vestigial or absent expansor secundariorum muscle

<doc id="237574" wikidata="Q7696089" url="?curid=237574" title="Telecommunications policy of the United States">
<text>The telecommunications policy of the United States is a framework of law directed by government and the regulatory commissions, most notably the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Two landmark acts prevail today, the Communications Act of 1934 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The latter was intended to revise the first act and specifically to foster competition in the telecommunications industry.

==Aims==
In the name of public interest, a large proportion of telecommunications policy is concerned with the economic regulation of interstate and international communication. This includes all communication by radio, telephone, wire, cable and satellite. Telecommunications policy outlines antitrust laws as is common for industries with large barriers to entry. Other features of the policies addressed include common carrier laws which controls access to networks. While the telephone providers are required to be common carriers, there is an ongoing net neutrality debate about the obligations of ISP&#x27;s.

Telecommunications policy addresses the management of government-owned resources such as the spectrum, which facilitates all wireless communications. There is a naturally limited quantity of usable spectrum that exists, therefore the market demand is immense, especially as use of mobile technology, which uses the electromagnetic spectrum, expands. One of the goals of the FCC is to best utilize this limited resource in such a way will bring about the &quot;highest and best use&quot;. License to use spectrum was originally determined by committee, however, since 1993 it has been determined by an auction to assure that the licensee is both qualified and motivated to make best use of this commodity.
For example, an FM station in Iowa was recently auctioned for $4,397,250.

The famous American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) empire was once based on the concept that they had the duty and honor of serving the public people in return for their monopoly on the telecommunications industry.

With the recent events of our world, such as the September 11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and others it has been deemed essential for National Security that a dedicated network with ample spectrum for crisis communication exist. The National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) manages spectrum used by the Federal government such as air traffic control and national defense. The FCC is responsible for spectrum used by others, including individuals and public safety and health officials like police and emergency medical technicians.

==Institutional framework in the U.S.==
*Independent Regulatory Commissions
* FCC, state PUCs (Public Utility Commissions)
* &quot;Delegation Doctrine&quot;: statutory authority
** quasi-legislative, executive and judicial functions
* Legislative role (delegation, oversight, budget)
* Executive role (appointment, budget)
* Judicial role (review commission decisions)

The hallmark event in the history of the US telecommunication industry was the breakup of the Bell System into regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) or &quot;Baby Bells&quot; in the early 1980s.

The challenge since remains preserving competition and no longer allowing monopolies.

There are a number of agencies concerned with telecommunication policy:
* The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
* The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

==Broadband deployment policy objectives==
The FCC derives its jurisdiction to facilitate the deployment of broadband to Americans in Section 706 in the Telecommunications act of 1996. In this section the code states that the FCC is to “encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans.”
They currently want to advocate the following objectives:
*Broaden the deployment of broadband technologies
*Define broadband to include any platform capable of transmitting high-bandwidth intensive services
*Ensure harmonized regulatory treatment of competing broadband services
*Encourage and facilitate an environment that stimulates investment and innovation in broadband technologies and services

==Wire line and wireless telecommunications policy==
Currently, the policy being set forth by the FCC has two different levels of regulation. One for fixed line, wire line communications and the other for wireless communications. Their current tenets strictly regulate network neutrality on wire line networks. However the commission is placing as many mandates on wireless communications. This means that wireless telecommunications providers are not permitted to block any website, but they may block applications and services unless they are direct competitors to the provider&#x27;s content or services. This difference between the two technologies creates a major loophole in telecommunications policy, as most providers have already begun the shift from wired to wireless network infrastructures.

<doc id="237576" wikidata="Q1281204" url="?curid=237576" title="James Carville">
<text>Chester James Carville Jr. (born October 25, 1944) is an American political consultant, author and occasional actor who has strategized for candidates for public office in the United States and in at least 23 nations abroad. A Democrat, he is a center-left leaning pundit in U.S. elections who appears frequently on cable news programs, podcasts, and public speeches.

Nicknamed the &quot;Ragin&#x27; Cajun&quot;, Carville gained national attention for his work as a lead strategist in Bill Clinton&#x27;s winning 1992 presidential campaign. Carville also had a principal role crafting strategy for three unsuccessful Democratic Party presidential contenders, including Massachusetts Senator John Kerry in 2004, New York Senator Hillary Clinton in 2008, and Colorado Senator Michael Bennet in 2020.

He is married to longtime Republican political consultant Mary Matalin.

==Early life and education==
Carville was born on October 25, 1944, at a U.S. Army hospital at Georgia&#x27;s Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), where his father was stationed during World War II. While his mother, Lucille (née Normand), had stayed behind in Carville, Louisiana, where James was raised, she traveled to Fort Benning long enough to have her firstborn son born there. Later, Carville noted: &quot;We were availing ourselves to free government health services.&quot; Lucille Carville, a former school teacher, spoke French at home, and sold the &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot; door to door. His father, Chester James Carville Sr., was a postmaster and owner of a general store.
Carville, Louisiana, a neighborhood in the city of St. Gabriel, in Iberville Parish, located 16 miles south of the capital city of Baton Rouge on the Mississippi River, was named after his paternal grandfather Louis Arthur Carville, who was once the postmaster. Louis Arthur&#x27;s mother, Octavia Dehon, was of Belgian parentage and had married John Madison Carville, described in a biography as &quot;Irish-born&quot; and a &quot;carpetbagger.&quot; Together, they established the general store operated by the family in Carville, in 1882. Carville has seven siblings (Bonnie, Mary Ann, Gail, Pat, Steve, Bill, and Angela.).

Among Carville&#x27;s earliest political campaign work was ripping down the campaign signs of a candidate for public office during high school. Carville graduated from Ascension Catholic High School in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, in 1962.

He attended Louisiana State University (LSU) from 1962 to 1966, but did not graduate at that time. In a 1994 feature in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Carville characterized himself as &quot;something less than an attentive scholar. I had 56 hours&#x27; worth of Fs before LSU finally threw me out.&quot;

Carville served a two-year enlistment in the United States Marine Corps, from 1966 to 1968, where he was stationed stateside, at Camp Pendleton in Oceanside. He attained the rank of corporal.

Following his military enlistment, Carville finished his studies at LSU at night, where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in general studies in 1970 and his Juris Doctor degree in 1973. Carville is a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He later worked as a junior high school science teacher. Before entering politics, Carville worked as an attorney at McKernnan, Beychok, Screen and Pierson, a Baton Rouge law firm, from 1973 to 1979.

== Political consulting in the United States 1970s to 1990s ==
Carville was trained in consulting by Gus Weill, who in 1958 had opened the first advertising firm that specialized in political campaigns in the state capital in Baton Rouge.

=== East Baton Rouge Parish, 1970s and 1980s ===
In a 2012 piece he wrote for &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, Carville described one of his earliest political jobs distributing &quot;hate sheets&quot; with negative literature on a political opponent at grocery stores on behalf of Ossie Bluege Brown, during Brown&#x27;s 1972 campaign for district attorney of East Baton Rouge Parish.

In addition to his work as an attorney, in the late 1970s, Carville also worked for Gus Weill and Raymond Strother at Weill-Strother, a Baton-Rouge-based political consulting firm that, over the years, had assisted with electoral campaigns and political messaging for Louisiana governors Jimmie Davis, John McKeithen, Edwin Edwards, and U.S. Representative Otto Passman.

In the early 1980s, Carville served as executive assistant to East Baton Rouge Parish mayor-president Pat Screen.

In early 1985, Carville consulted to help Cathy Long win a special election to central Louisiana&#x27;s now-defunct 8th congressional district, following the death of her husband, Gillis William Long, of Louisiana&#x27;s Long family political dynasty.

===Texas Senate race, 1984===
In 1984, Carville became acquainted with his consulting partner Paul Begala when Carville managed then-Texas state legislator Lloyd Doggett&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the open Texas Senate seat. Carville helped Doggett, an unabashed liberal and committed enemy of special interests, secure the Democratic nomination in a primary that included conservative U.S. Representative Kent Hance, and centrist former congressman Bob Krueger. During the primary, Carville borrowed a rubber vertebrae exhibit from a friend who was a personal injury attorney and coached Doggett on using it as a prop on the stump to attack Krueger as a political flip flopper, who lacked resolve and &quot;backbone.&quot;

During the general election, Doggett&#x27;s opponent, Phil Gramm, leveraged vicious identity-based attacks on Doggett. On one occasion, Doggett returned the small dollar fundraising he received from a gay rights group. Gramm emphasized themes of &quot;family values,&quot; including his insistence at a June 1984 prayer breakfast on &quot;having people who believe in Christianity in charge of government,&quot; and Carville counter-punched that theme as antisemitic. Doggett was defeated in the general election, polling 2,207,557 votes (41.5 percent), to Gramm&#x27;s 3,116,348 votes (58.5 percent).

Finding himself out of work after the November 1984 defeat, Carville recalled, &quot;I was scared to death, I was 40 years old, and didn&#x27;t have any health insurance, I didn&#x27;t have any money, I was mortified.&quot;

===Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 1986===
Carville helped Bob Casey Sr. win election as the 42nd Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986. Casey defeated Philadelphia District Attorney Ed Rendell in the Democratic primary in March, 56.5% to 39.6%.

In the general election, Casey&#x27;s Republican opponent, Lieutenant Governor Bill Scranton, took the lead in the polls after announcing that his campaign was pulling all negative ads and challenging Casey to do the same. However, the Scranton campaign misstepped by sending a mailer to 600,000 Republican voters that, in addition to a letter from Scranton&#x27;s father, former Pennsylvania Governor and U.N. Ambassador William Scranton, included a brochure harshly attacking Casey&#x27;s ethics.

Carville – who, The New York Times would later write, was brought into the campaign to &quot;ramp up the aggression level&quot; – began to counter, contacting journalists and characterizing the mailer as outrageous. Scranton claimed he did not know about the mailing, so Carville ordered 600,000 blank envelopes, loaded them onto a truck, and dumped them onto a street corner near Scranton&#x27;s campaign headquarters. Television cameras captured the campaign, asking: &quot;How could you send out this many envelopes and not know about it?&quot; Three weeks before the election, a poster appeared statewide, depicting Scranton as a &quot;long-haired, dope smoking hippie.&quot;

The race was virtually tied until five days before the election, when Carville launched the &quot;guru,&quot; a TV commercial that portrayed Scranton as having been a regular drug user during the 1960s, also mocking Scranton&#x27;s interest in transcendental meditation and his ties to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The image of Scranton as a meditating, long-haired, dope-smoking hippie, with a background of sitar music, was credited with tipping the scales against Scranton in the socially conservative rural sections of Pennsylvania where Carville selectively decided to run the &quot;guru&quot; TV commercial. Casey went on to win the election by a narrow margin of 79,216 out of 3.3 million total votes cast, or 50.7% of the vote to Scranton&#x27;s 48.4%.

===Kentucky gubernatorial contest, 1987===
In 1987, Carville worked as a campaign manager to cast Kentucky businessman Wallace Wilkinson as a self-made millionaire anti-establishment gubernatorial candidate. Wilkinson, who had made his fortune in retail, and real estate development, and who was sued for not paying overtime to his employees, and refused to release his tax returns to the public, charged his Democratic primary opponents with wanting to raise taxes, and continually campaigned on creating a state lottery to raise public revenue.

During the general election portion of the campaign, on September 25th, 1987, Carville appeared on WLEX-TV&#x27;s &quot;Your Government&quot; public affairs program and implored reporters to look into the background of Wilkinson&#x27;s opponent John Harper&#x27;s family, noting: &quot;there might be problems with some of Harper&#x27;s children.&quot; After the incident, Harper confirmed that his son had been shot and killed by Franklin County, Ohio, police during a 1978 pharmacy robbery. Wilkinson won the general election polling 504,674 votes (64.5%) to Harper&#x27;s 273,141 (34.91%), and, as Kentucky&#x27;s 57th governor, secured passage of a state constitutional amendment to allow a lottery.

===New Jersey senatorial contest, 1988===
Carville served as campaign manager to New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg during Lautenberg&#x27;s successful 1988 re-election campaign. Carville and his partner Paul Begala both led Lautenberg&#x27;s successful campaign against Republican challenger Pete Dawkins, a Brigadier General and former Heisman Trophy winner who had Roger Stone as a consultant.

===Georgia gubernatorial contest, 1990===
In 1989 and 1990, Carville assisted conservative Democrat and four-term lieutenant governor Zell Miller in winning the state party&#x27;s gubernatorial nomination in a five-candidate contest that included Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, then-state senator Roy Barnes, and former governor Lester Maddox.

Miller campaigned on a platform of shock incarceration boot camps for first-time drug offenders, blasted Young for &quot;an explosion of crime&quot; in Atlanta, and painted Young with wanting to &quot;run away from&quot; the issue of drugs. At Carville&#x27;s counseling, Miller made a state lottery in lieu of state tax increases a central theme of his campaign. Carville attributed Miller&#x27;s eleven-point primary victory over Young to the attraction of the lottery issue and its capacity to turn out white suburban voters. &quot;Zell Miller was able to set the agenda, and the agenda was the lottery&quot;, Carville noted.

Miller won the nominating contest in the August 1990 runoff against Young and later defeated Johnny Isakson in the November 1990 general election. Miller was later a keynote speaker at the 1992 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention.

===Texas gubernatorial election, 1990===

Carville consulted in 1990 for former Texas Congressman and sitting state Attorney General Jim Mattox, a bare-knuckled political brawler who routinely traveled to Huntsville to attend state executions in Texas, the most active state in carrying out the death penalty. On advice from Carville, Mattox, who was seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination that year, based his campaign on the claim that a state lottery would solve Texas&#x27; revenue needs without additional state taxes.

With no facts to support the charge, Mattox also ran a television advertisement accusing his primary opponent, State Treasurer Ann Richards, a recovering alcoholic, of being a cannabis and cocaine user who might falter in fulfilling the responsibilities of being governor. In losing the nominating contest to Richards, Mattox gained a reputation as a combative campaigner.

=== Pennsylvania special senatorial election, 1991 ===
In 1991, Carville consulted for Harris Wofford in his run for the open U.S. Senate seat left vacant when Senator John Heinz was killed in an April 1991 plane crash. Following the crash, Carville, who was by then a close political confidant of Governor Casey, hatched a plan to offer his appointment of the Senate seat to Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, an Allentown native who declined the offer within 24 hours. Attorney and later Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney II was also considered. Still, Casey ultimately decided to appoint Wofford, then his state Secretary of Labor, to fill the seat, and Wofford faced a special election in November of that year.

Against the national backdrop of the first Gulf War, and a dour economy, Wofford&#x27;s general election opponent, George H.W. Bush&#x27;s sitting U.S. Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, was widely seen as a surrogate of the Bush political machine, and the contest was widely viewed as an early referendum on Bush&#x27;s reelection prospects the following year.

Wofford was one of the first whites to graduate from Howard University School of Law, traveled to India and wrote a book on Gandhi, co-founded the Peace Corps, and was arrested at the 1968 Democratic National Convention for disorderly conduct, and was an opponent of apartheid. A philosophical progressive and college president, he had served as an aide to John F. Kennedy, and was a friend and adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. Wofford had the air of an &quot;anti-politician,&quot; rumpled in appearance and uncomfortable with small talk, who ran a campaign with themes of economic populism.

Though the issue polled a distant 5th in voter concerns, Wofford eschewed guidance from his consultants in demanding national health insurance be the centerpiece of his campaign. With the assistance of a guild of Philadelphia ophthalmologists, Wofford crafted an impactful slogan: &quot;If criminals have access to a lawyer, working Americans should have a right to a doctor.&quot;

During the race, Carville helped Wofford craft an aggressive campaign,
 with television advertisements attacking Thornburgh for taking expensive flights at public expense in government jets to junkets in places such as Hawaii. Another Wofford campaign commercial evoked an anti-establishmentarian air, linking Thornburgh to &quot;the mess in Washington.&quot;

In the months before the election, Wofford overcame Thornburgh&#x27;s 44-point lead in the polls and defeated him in November, garnering 1,860,760 votes (55 percent) to Thornburgh&#x27;s 1,521,986 (45 percent).

Wofford&#x27;s surprise victory helped earn Carville national attention, with the Democratic Party now hoping that he could now help the party win the White House in 1992 U.S. Presidential election.

Carville again consulted for Wofford&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1994 when he was narrowly defeated by Republican Rick Santorum.

=== Los Angeles mayoral election, 1992–1993 ===

In late 1992 and early 1993, Carville consulted for San Fernando Valley state assemblyman Richard Katz in his run for the open 1993 Los Angeles mayoral election, which was the first time in 63 years that an incumbent mayor didn&#x27;t appear on the ballot. Katz ran on a tough-on-crime platform that included gun control, new sales taxes on firearms and ammunition, and selling-off city-owned infrastructure, such as the Ontario International Airport, to pay police overtime, while promising not to raise property taxes. Despite retaining Carville, and spending a million dollars on campaign television commercials, Katz finished behind three other candidates, garnering 46,173 votes, or 9.73% of 474,366 total votes cast in the nonpartisan blanket mayoral primary, and did not advance to the general election.

== Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign ==
In 1992, Carville helped lead Bill Clinton to a win against George H. W. Bush in the presidential election. In crafting an economic strategy for Clinton, Carville reprised the populist rhetoric his client, Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford, successfully wielded the prior year, which was distilled into a series of articles Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele wrote for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. The articles were re-printed into book form: &quot;America: What Went Wrong?&quot; which became a prop Clinton brandished effectively from the stump during a time of economic recession. In bringing in the series of articles from the Wofford campaign, Carville imported an angry left-wing populism as a campaign theme.

One of the formulations he used in that campaign has entered common usage, derived from a list he posted in the campaign war room to help focus himself and his staff, with these three points:

# Change vs. more of the same.
# The economy, stupid.
# Don&#x27;t forget health care.

Carville sought to shield Clinton from Gennifer Flowers&#x27; allegations of her extramarital sexual affair, which emerged shortly before the 1992 New Hampshire Democratic primary. Carville alleged that a supermarket tabloid paid Flowers $175,000 for sharing her story, and that &quot;the mainstream media got sucker-punched&quot; by her allegations. Carville set out to shame the press, berating reporters with charges of &quot;cash for trash&quot; journalism, and noted: &quot;I&#x27;m a lot more expensive than Gennifer Flowers.&quot;. Flowers later brought a civil suit against Carville in 1999 (see below).

In June 1992, trailing George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot in the polls, Clinton limped toward the national convention, while the Los Angeles riots crowded him out of news coverage. Carville knew he needed to bring Clinton back into the news limelight. He did so by orchestrating Clinton&#x27;s splashy criticism of hip hop artist Sister Souljah in a prepared speech Clinton delivered at the Rainbow Coalition&#x27;s June 1992 &quot;Rebuild America&quot; conference in Washington, D.C. Sister Souljah had remarked: &quot;If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?&quot; Clinton responded in his speech by saying, &quot;If you took the words, &#x27;white&#x27; and &#x27;black&#x27; and you reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.&quot; Clinton refuted the suggestion that his speech was a calculated attempt to appeal to moderate and conservative swing voters by standing up to a core Democratic constituency. The speech had the effect of opening up a public war between Clinton and Jesse Jackson.

In 1993, Carville was honored as Campaign District Manager of the Year by the American Association of Political Consultants. His role in the Clinton campaign was documented in the feature-length Academy Award-nominated film &quot;The War Room&quot;.

==American politics during the 1990s==

Carville continued to serve the Democratic National Committee in a political capacity during the 1990s, and had an ongoing need to regularly visit the White House to speak with then President Bill Clinton on political matters. Accordingly, Carville was once one of only twenty individuals at the time who was granted a permanent &quot;Non-Government Service&quot; security badge, which were used for non-government employees, such as contractors, who needed regular access to the White House grounds. In consideration for the privilege of the permanent pass, the Clinton Administration asked Carville to submit to a full security clearance style FBI background check.

In response to the 1997 civil lawsuit then Arkansas state employee Paula Jones filed against Bill Clinton over her claims of sexual harassment while attending a conference on official business, Carville infamously remarked: &quot;Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there&#x27;s no telling what you&#x27;ll find.&quot; South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham later made reference to Carville&#x27;s trailer park line during the 2018 Brett Kavanaugh SCOTUS confirmation hearings in reference to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. During an October, 2018 interview with Michael Smerconish on CNN, on the topic of Graham alluding to Carville&#x27;s &quot;drag $100&quot;, Carville remarked that, at the time, &quot;I was making a joke&quot;, and added &quot;I&#x27;m always complimented when people use my lines; you always like to leave a little legacy out there.&quot;

In 1999, Gennifer Flowers, who had previously alleged an affair with Carville&#x27;s 1992 client Bill Clinton, sued Carville and his colleague George Stephanopoulos for defamation of character. In 2000, Flowers additionally named Hillary Clinton as a defendant in the suit. Attorney Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy organization, represented her in the suit. Flowers contended that Carville and Stephanopoulos ignored obvious warning signs that news media reporting did not conclusively determine that tapes of her recorded telephone conversations with Clinton were &quot;doctored.&quot; In 2004, a federal district court dismissed the case with summary judgment. Klayman then appealed the case on Flowers&#x27; behalf. In 2006, 14 years after the allegations of the affair became an issue for Bill Clinton&#x27;s first presidential campaign, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the lower court&#x27;s dismissal.

==International elections 1990s to 2010s==
Beginning in the mid-1990s, Carville worked on a number of election campaigns abroad, including those of Tony Blair, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, during the 2001 general election (in which Blair was comfortably re-elected), and with the Liberal Party of Canada.

Carville viewed working campaigns abroad as more commercially lucrative, and with less reputational risk than campaigns in the United States noting in 2009: &quot;If you help elect a president and then you get involved in a governor&#x27;s race and you lose, it&#x27;s going to be a little bit damaging to your reputation. But if you go to Peru and you run a presidential race and you lose, no one knows or cares. So why go to New Jersey and lose for 100 grand when you can go to Peru and lose for a million?&quot; 

Carville has been less forthcoming to the news media about his work abroad, and remarked to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter in 1999, &quot;I won&#x27;t comment on anything I do outside the U.S.&quot;

=== Work with U.S. State Department ===
In 2002, on behalf of the U.S. State Department, Carville, and his wife, political consultant Mary Matalin, met with a group of 55 Arab women political leaders during the 2002 United States midterm elections. The programming, &quot;Women as Political Leaders&quot; International Visitor (IV) Program&quot;, was the first program implemented under the auspices of the Middle East Partnership Initiative, a collection of 40 programs headed by then deputy assistant secretary for Near East Affairs Liz Cheney. In addition to events with Carville and Matalin, the group met with congressional, state and local campaign staff, and observed campaign work during their visits to Concord, New Hampshire, Dallas, Texas, Detroit, Michigan, Toledo, Ohio, Raleigh, North Carolina, and Tallahassee and Tampa, Florida.

That year, Carville also proposed visiting Arab and Muslim nations on behalf of the US government to do &quot;some kind of propaganda,&quot; adding &quot;I&#x27;d love to use my experience and skills to tell people about my country and what&#x27;s available to them beyond hopelessness and terrorism.&quot; He added, &quot;What the terrorists are after is the younger and increasingly poor population. What they are offering is not that much, but we are not doing a good job telling those young people the other side of the story. It&#x27;s time we told them about choices they have without imposing American values.&quot;
=== Greece, 1993 ===
Carville, Begala, and Mary Matalin advised incumbent Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis in an election that saw local Greek press allege United States interference in the election. Unpopular because his program of economic austerity and privatization, Mitsotakis failed in his reelection bid, and lost to democratic socialist Andreas Papandreou.

=== Brazil, 1994 ===
In 1994, Carville consulted for Fernando Henrique Cardoso in his successful 1994 campaign for the Brazilian presidency. Cardoso, a professor and Fulbright Fellow lectured in the United States during the 1980s at Columbia University on issues of democracy in Brazil. Cardoso, often nicknamed &quot;FHC&quot;, was elected with the support of a heterodox alliance of his own Social Democratic Party, the PSDB, and two right-wing parties, the Liberal Front Party (PFL) and the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). During his tenure in office, Cardoso&#x27;s administration liquidated public assets and deepened the privatization of government-owned enterprises in steel milling, telecommunications and mining, along with making reforms to Brazil&#x27;s social security income program and tax systems.

=== Honduras, 1997 ===

In 1997, Carville consulted for then leader of the National Congress of Honduras, Carlos Flores Facussé, in his presidential campaign. Flores attended the American School of Tegucigalpa, studied international finance at Louisiana State University in the early 1970s, and married a U.S. citizen from Tennessee.
He later became the publisher of his family&#x27;s &quot;La Tribuna&quot;, a leading Honduran newspaper, and served on various corporate boards of directors, including the Central Bank of Honduras, and became involved in politics. Flores was aligned with former president Roberto Suazo Córdova&#x27;s &quot;Rodista&quot; faction, the more conservative wing of the liberal party. Vowing to move Honduras past its image of being primarily a banana and coffee exporter, Flores campaigned on his &quot;New Agenda&quot; platform, which included a ten-point plan to stabilize the economy. Flores distanced himself from the outgoing Reina administration, while successfully portraying himself as an opposition candidate from the same party.

In the November 1997 general election, Flores faced National party candidate Nora Gúnera de Melgar, the wife of General Juan Alberto Melgar Castro, who seized power in a 1975 coup which removed then president Oswaldo López Arellano after his bananagate bribery scandal with United Fruit Company.

Flores defeated his opponent by a 10% margin of 195,418 votes out of a total of 1,885,388 votes cast. Gúnera de Melgar&#x27;s campaign was aided by the assistance Dick Morris, a rival political consultant and also a political adviser to Bill Clinton. Morris claimed he had no knowledge of Carville&#x27;s involvement with his opponent until after the election.

In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras, and post-hurricane reconstruction efforts resulted in international development banks&#x27; renegotiation of much of Honduras&#x27; external debt in exchange for structural adjustment policies. After selling state-owned airports and energy companies, Flores unsuccessfully attempted to privatize Hondutel, the state-owned telephone utility, and when that effort failed, the International Monetary Fund froze the distribution of loans and demanded that the government further accelerate its privatization programs.

=== Ecuador, 1998 ===
In 1998, Carville helped to craft a successful strategy to elect Jamil Mahuad Witt as President of Ecuador. Mahuad, an Ecuadorian-born attorney, earned a Master of Public Administration from Harvard Kennedy School, where he was Mason Fellow. He was also a US State Department-sponsored Fulbright Fellow, who lectured in ethics and politics at several universities.

Mahuad was elected Mayor of Quito in the 1990s before retaining the services of Carville to help him win the Ecuadorian presidency, in a campaign in which Mahuad touted his educational background at Harvard Kennendy School.

In the wake of an economic crisis from falling oil prices and stagnant economic growth, Mahuad decreed a state of emergency, and embarked on austerity measures to stifle rampant inflation, including sales tax and gasoline tax increases, freezing bank account withdrawals, and the dollarization of the economy which included the sudden voiding and invalidation of the sucre, Ecuador&#x27;s currency since 1884. In January 2000, Mahuad was forced from office in a military coup following demonstrations by Ecuadorians. Mahuad fled to exile in the United States. In 2014, an Ecuadorian court convicted Mahuad, in absentia, of embezzlement during his time in office, and sentenced him to twelve years in prison. Interpol also issued a warrant for his arrest.
=== Panama, 1998 ===

In 1998, the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) party in Panama retained Carville as their main adviser to help re-elect then term-limited President Ernesto Pérez Balladares during an election where opposition figures suggested that Perez Balladares was hoping to convey the impression that the Clinton Administration in the United States secretly favored a second term for him. Pérez Balladares, who attended college in the United States at the University of Notre Dame before attaining his Master&#x27;s at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, reformed Panama&#x27;s Labor Code, privatized Panama&#x27;s telephone and electrical utilities, and ushered Panama into the World Trade Organization during his tenure. Despite massive spending by the PRD, including the hiring of Carville to craft an effective political strategy, the proposal to lift his term limitation was defeated by a margin of almost 2 to 1.

=== Israel, 1998–1999 ===
At the suggestion of President Clinton, who had grown frustrated with Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s intransigence towards the peace process, Carville, along with colleagues Bob Shrum, a speechwriter for President Clinton, and Stanley Greenberg, consulted in late 1998 and early 1999 for Labor Party candidate Ehud Barak to help him prepare for the 1999 prime ministerial election.

Carville and colleagues endeavored to help Barak seize control of the daily debate, and boost his struggling challenge to the incumbent Netanyahu. Short, declarative sentences, sound bites, rapid responses, repetition, wedge issues, ethnic exploitation, nightly polling, negative research, searing attack advertisements on television, all familiar tools of American politics, arrived on the Israeli political scene during the election, as a part of what Netanyahu&#x27;s director of communications, David Bar-Illan, characterized as an Americanization of the election, and Netanyahu advisers implied White House meddling in an Israeli election. Barak won election by a double digit margin and served for over two years, before calling a special prime ministerial election in 2001.

=== Argentina, 1999 ===
Carville consulted for Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde in his 1999 run for president of Argentina as the Justicialist Party nominee. Carville remarked in May, 1999 that U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek introduced him to Duhalde in January, 1998. Carville&#x27;s consulting fee ran $30,000 per month, in 1999 US dollars, added to a percentage of campaign advertisements, plus first class airfare and hotel expenses.

Duhalde spent much of the campaign embroiled in a power struggle with his own party and incumbent President Carlos Menem who was barely dissuaded from running for a third term despite constitutional term limits, and a series of court rulings against him. The contest of campaigns was rather flat; there were no presidential debates, nor large campaign rallies, nor were any major changes in course promised by the frontrunner candidates. Duhalde emphasized his law and order credentials as a campaign theme. One television advertisement for Duhalde&#x27;s campaign depicted him walking in the woods alone, talking to himself, and bemoaning all the political enemies plotting against him. Carville clashed with Duhalde&#x27;s public relations team leading up to the election, which lead to his departure.

Against an economic backdrop of the Argentine Great Depression, Duhalde lost the October 1999 general election to Radical Civic Union party candidate Fernando de la Rúa who enjoyed the strategy and advice of U.S. American political consult Dick Morris (like Carville, also a former consultant to President Bill Clinton). De la Rúa would later resign during the December 2001 riots, and the Argentine Congress appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodríguez Saá as president. When Rodríguez Saá also resigned, Congress appointed Duhalde, who would serve as president of Argentina from January, 2002 through May, 2003.

=== Bolivia, 2002 ===
In 2002, through his firm Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS), Carville strategized in Bolivia on behalf of Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) party presidential candidate Gonzalo &quot;Goni&quot; Sánchez de Lozada. The son of a political exile, Sánchez de Lozada spent his early years in Iowa, studied at the University of Chicago, and spoke Spanish with a midwestern American accent. Sanchez de Lozada served as Bolivian president in the mid 1990s, and had a record of using shock therapy, economic liberalization, and privatization. In his 2002 election campaign, he faced the first serious challenge to the hegemony of the established Bolivian political parties in the form of Evo Morales and his left-wing populist and indigenist Movement for Socialism (MAS) party.

Carville helped Sanchez de Lozada run a campaign playbook with a slick media campaign under the
slogan &quot;Bolivia sí puede&quot; (&quot;Yes, Bolivia can&quot;) that featured negative attack ads on his opponents, particularly against Cochabamba mayor Manfred Reyes Villa. In one campaign advertisement, Reyes Villa was blamed for rampant diarrhea in the city&#x27;s poor children.

Sanchez de Lozada garnered a plurality of votes, 22.46%, against Evo Morales second place finish at 20.94%, before coming to power in August 2002 in a coalition government formed with two other political parties. Lozada resigned in October, 2003 and fled to exile in the United States following the 2003 Bolivian Gas Conflict. Carville&#x27;s work for Lozada in Bolivia was portrayed in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Our Brand Is Crisis&quot;, which inspired the 2015 narrative form film &quot;Our Brand is Crisis&quot;.

=== Venezuela, 2003 ===
In early 2003, Carville worked in Venezuela as an advisor to Venezuelan business interests that had previously led an economically devastating strike in the spring of 2002 by managers of the national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), in an effort to destabilize the government of leftist president Hugo Chávez. In the aftermath of an unsuccessful coup attempt in April 2002, the group sought Carville&#x27;s assistance in displacing Chávez from office. In a September 2006 interview that touched on the topic, Carville remarked: &quot;I&#x27;ve worked in Venezuela and I would be very reluctant to call Chávez a democrat.&quot;

=== Afghanistan 2009 ===
Afghan presidential candidate Ashraf Ghani hired Carville as a campaign advisor in July 2009. Ghani, who renounced his US Citizenship in order to run for the presidency of Afghanistan, attended high school in the United States in Lake Oswego, Oregon, during the late 1960s, earned his master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University in 1977, was a Fulbright Fellow in the United States who taught at UC Berkeley, and Johns Hopkins University in the 1980s, and worked as an economist at the Washington, DC-based World Bank in the 1990s.

Ghani and Carville met in Washington in the spring of 2009 through mutual friends. Carville would not say whether he was paid to advise Ghani, whereas Ghani claimed that Carville volunteered his time. Carville remarked at the time that the 2009 Afghan presidential election is &quot;probably the most important election held in the world in a long time,&quot; and he called his new job &quot;probably the most interesting project I have ever worked in my life.&quot; When asked about similarities between politics in Afghanistan and politics in Louisiana, Carville responded: &quot;Yeah, I felt a little bit at home, to be honest with you.&quot; Carville&#x27;s objective was to help prevent one of Ghani&#x27;s opponents, Hamid Karzai, from garnering a majority of votes, to force the election into a second round. Ghani garnered just 2.94% of the vote, with Kazai finishing just shy of a 50% majority. After a cancelled run-off election Karzai became president.

=== Colombia 2010 ===
In 2010, Carville worked as senior advisor to elect presidential candidate Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia. The Colombian-born Santos attended the University of Kansas for undergraduate studies from 1969 to 1973, graduating with a degree in economics and business. He returned to the U.S. as Fulbright visiting fellow at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1981, and also earned a master&#x27;s degree from Harvard Kennedy School in 1981, and lectured as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1988.

Santos later joined the Washington, DC-based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue, and served as Colombia&#x27;s Minister of Trade, and Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia during the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2006, then President Alvaro Uribe appointed Santos as Colombia&#x27;s Minister of Defence. Santos supervised the military during a period of political tension and military action targeted at the FARC guerrilla group, including a controversial military raid on Ecuador&#x27;s border, and extrajudicial assassinations during the &quot;False positives&quot; scandal.

Carville played a crucial role for Santos, helping him to analyze voter polls, and crafted a winning strategy, that included the night-time distribution of pamphlets under the doors of voters&#x27; homes predicting the end of popular social welfare initiatives if Santos wasn&#x27;t elected.

On June 20, 2010, after two rounds of voting, Santos was elected as President of Colombia and was inaugurated on 7 August 2010 in the midst of a diplomatic crisis with Venezuela. The U.S. State Department remarked in official communications that it was &quot;pleased&quot; with the election of Santos, and praised the &quot;spirited debate&quot; before the runoff and Colombia&#x27;s &quot;longstanding commitment to democratic principles&quot;. In 2017, Santos acknowledged that his 2010 campaign received illegal payments from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht.

=== Argentina 2015 ===

Carville acted as advisor for Daniel Scioli&#x27;s 2007 and 2011&#x27;s campaigns for the governor of Buenos Aires. He also consulted for his unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2015. The election featured allegations of vote-buying, when Scioli&#x27;s Front for Victory party was alleged to have distributed sacks with bottles of cooking oil, pasta and flour to Buenos Aires voters in exchange for their votes. Scioli was defeated in a November, 2015 runoff election.

== John Kerry&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign ==

In September 2004, after conversations with Bill Clinton, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry engaged the assistance of Carville as an informal adviser to his 2004 presidential campaign. Rival political consultant Dick Morris speculated at the time that Carville and Greenberg, instrumental participants in the Clinton&#x27;s political machine, infiltrated Kerry&#x27;s campaign as a way to engineer his defeat and clear a path for Hillary Clinton to run in 2008. In the aftermath of Kerry&#x27;s loss, Carville and colleagues Stanley Greenberg, as well as journalist Bob Shrum, sought to place blame on external events, including news media coverage of the Iraq War, the October, 2004 Osama bin Laden video, as well as Bush&#x27;s focus on cultural issues.

== 2000s ==
Carville co-hosted CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot; along with associate Paul Begala from 2002 until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2005. Carville was a CNN contributor until parting ways with the network in 2013. The following year, Carville joined Fox News Channel as a contributor.

In 2005, Carville taught a semester of the course &quot;Topics in American Politics&quot; at Northern Virginia Community College. Among the guests he had come speak to the class were Al Hunt, Mark Halperin, Senator George Allen, George Stephanopoulos, Karl Strubel, Stan Greenberg, Tony Blankley, representatives from the Motion Picture Association of America, and James Fallows.

In 2006, Carville became a host on a sports radio show, &quot;60/20 Sports&quot;, on XM Satellite Radio, with Luke Russert, son of NBC journalist Tim Russert. The show was an in-depth look at the culture of sports based on the difference in ages of the two hosts.

During 2006 mid-terms, then Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean mobilized a Fifty-state strategy. Democrats won control of both houses of Congress for the first time since the 1994 election. For the first time since the creation of the Republican party in 1854, no Republican captured any House, Senate, or Gubernatorial seat previously held by a Democrat. Notwithstanding, after the election, on November 15, 2006, Carville blasted Dean&#x27;s leadership as &quot;Rumsfeldian in its incompetence,&quot; called for Dean&#x27;s ouster as DNC Chair and his replacement with Harold Ford Jr., and claimed that, with a conventional strategy of piling money solely into close races, Democrats could have picked up as many as 50 House seats, roughly 20 more than they won that year. In late November 2006, Carville proposed a truce of sorts.

Carville was the executive producer of the 2006 film &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, starring Sean Penn and Anthony Hopkins, which is loosely based on the life of Louisiana Governor Huey Long.

In January, 2009, Carville predicted the execution of a peace agreement between Israel and Syria in the following 18 months, noting it would be a foreign policy priority for the incoming Obama administration. For several months in 2010, then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu participated in secret, American-brokered discussions with Syria toward a peace treaty based on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The Arab Spring ensued the following year, and the treaty never came to fruition.

On March 4, 2009, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Carville, Paul Begala, and Rahm Emanuel were the architects of the Democratic Party&#x27;s strategy to cast conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh as the face of the Republican Party. Carville was particularly critical of Limbaugh for saying he wanted Barack Obama to &quot;fail&quot;.

Carville was a regular contributor with Stan Greenberg to the weekly Carville-Greenberg Memo at The National Memo.

== Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign ==
Carville advised Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign. In remarks about then rival candidate, Senator Barack Obama, Carville declared in 2007 that Barack Obama was the Democratic candidate &quot;most likely to explode or implode.&quot;

On March 22, 2008, Carville compared New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who had just endorsed Barack Obama for the nomination, to Judas Iscariot, calling this &quot;an act of betrayal.&quot; Carville remarked, &quot;Mr. Richardson&#x27;s endorsement came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out for 30 pieces of silver, so I think the timing is appropriate, if ironic,&quot; referring to Holy week. Richardson had served President Bill Clinton as his Energy Secretary and Ambassador to the United Nations so Carville believed Richardson owed an endorsement to Senator Clinton. Carville also claimed Richardson assured many in the Clinton campaign that he would at least remain neutral and abstain from taking sides. Richardson denied Carville&#x27;s account, arguing that he had not made any promises to remain neutral. Richardson claims that his decision to endorse Obama was &quot;clinched&quot; by his speech on race relations following the swirl of controversy surrounding Obama&#x27;s former pastor Jeremiah Wright. Carville went on to note, &quot;I doubt if Governor Richardson and I will be terribly close in the future,&quot; Carville said, but &quot;I&#x27;ve had my say...I got one in the wheelhouse and I tagged it.&quot;

Even as Clinton&#x27;s campaign began to lose steam, Carville remained both loyal and positive in his public positions, rarely veering off message and stoutly defending the candidate. However, on May 13, 2008 a few hours before the primary in West Virginia, Carville remarked to an audience at Furman University in South Carolina, &quot;I&#x27;m for Senator Clinton but I think the great likelihood is that Obama will be the nominee.&quot; The moment marked a shift from his previous and often determinedly optimistic comments about the state of Clinton&#x27;s campaign.

After Barack Obama&#x27;s clear lead for victory in the Democratic presidential campaign on June 3, James Carville said he was ready to open up his wallet to help Obama build a political war chest to take on John McCain in November.

== 2010s ==

Carville was retained by Palantir Technologies as a paid adviser in 2011, and was instrumental in bringing about Palantir&#x27;s collaboration with the New Orleans Police Department to quietly deploy predictive policing software in New Orleans.

Carville has criticized Obama&#x27;s political style and demeanor over the years. On November 18th, 2010, Carville spoke to an audience at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast and remarked: &quot;If Hillary gave up one of her balls and gave it to Obama, he&#x27;d have two.&quot; Carville made a similar remark to political journalist Eleanor Clift during the midst of the primaries in May, 2008, insinuating that Hillary Clinton was a tougher candidate, remarking: &quot;If she gave him one of her cojones, they&#x27;d both have two.&quot;

In November 2013, in light of President Barack Obama&#x27;s declining approval poll numbers, Carville commented &quot;I think the best thing he can do is take a toke on the mayor of Toronto&#x27;s crack pipe, because his numbers are about 48.&quot;

On October 21, 2018, Carville participated with Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson at the 2018 PoltiCon in Los Angeles in &quot;A conversation with Eddie Izzard&quot;, an event chaired by the British comedian.

Carville joined the faculty of Louisiana State University&#x27;s Manship School of Mass Communication in January 2018. His work at the Manship School was supported by philanthropic gifts. He has also lectured in political science at Tulane University.

In 2019, political pundit Mark Halperin consulted with Carville for his upcoming book, &quot;How to Beat Trump: America&#x27;s Top Political Strategists on What It Will Take&quot;. Carville was asked what he would tell Halperin&#x27;s sexual assault victims, who have expressed disappointment and outrage that so many top Democrats were willing to talk with someone accused of such serious allegations, and remarked: &quot;I know he&#x27;s been accused by a lot of people and lost his job. The guy called me and asked me to speak to him on a topic that I obviously care about. And I spoke to him.&quot;

== 2020s ==

=== Michael Bennet&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign ===
In January 2020, Carville endorsed Colorado Senator Michael Bennet&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Carville appeared on stage with Bennet leading up to the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary at his political events in the state. Carville remarked of Bennet during the campaign season: &quot;This is John Kennedy recloned, you can&#x27;t get any better than this guy!&quot; Bennet, who leaned hard on Carville&#x27;s endorsement, garnered 963 votes in New Hampshire, or 0.3% of 300,022 total Democratic ballots cast in a year of record-shattering turnout.

=== 2020 election cycle ===

Carville has also entered the podcast business, and, along with Al Hunt hosts &quot;2020 Politics War Room&quot;, which purports to offer &quot;a backstage pass to impeachment and the 2020 Election.&quot; He continues to make frequent appearances with Brian Williams in MSNBC cable news programming to comment on the 2020 Democratic debates, caucuses and primaries, and the trajectory of the 2020 Democratic nomination and general election.

In February 2020, Carville suggested jettisoning the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses, letting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi select the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential and vice-presidential candidates, and suggested Mitt Romney should &quot;resign from the Senate to save the Democratic Party&#x27;s ass, and run our convention.&quot; Carville further added he might cast a write in vote for Nancy Pelosi when he votes in Louisiana.

In February 2020 media appearances and interviews, against a backdrop of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders&#x27; rise in the polls, Carville expressed his displeasure at the prospect of Sanders being nominated, branded Sanders as a &quot;communist&quot; and pejoratively labeled Sanders&#x27; base of support as a &quot;cult&quot;, warning of the &quot;end of days&quot; if Sanders were to win the Democratic nomination. Carville used his media appearances surrounding the dustup to rail against the ascendance of progressive populist Democratic policy positions such as student loan debt forgiveness and &quot;people voting from jail cells.&quot; Carville also decried banning hydraulic fracking for shale gas.

In November 2020, Carville predicted that the result of the presidential election would be known by 10p.m. on election day. After the Associated Press took an additional four days to declare the winner, &quot;Politico&quot; named Carville&#x27;s prediction among &quot;the most audacious, confident and spectacularly incorrect prognostications about the year&quot;.

=== Pennsylvania Senate election, 2022 ===

In 2022, Carville led the &quot;Penn Progress&quot; Super Pac, which spent the entirety of its funds in support of Rep. Conor Lamb&#x27;s bid for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by retiring senator Pat Toomey. Lamb worked closely with Carville&#x27;s SuperPac, and participated in donor calls Carville arranged. 

Carville&#x27;s Super PAC bankrolled TV ads which sought to portray one of Lamb&#x27;s primary opponents, Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman as a &quot;self-described democratic socialist.&quot; Within a day of airing, PolitiFact and Factcheck.org called the attack ad false, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; commented that Fetterman had never actually described himself that way, the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia, stopped broadcasting the ad, and Senator Elizabeth Warren called on Lamb to disavow it. Echoing a fanciful attack by Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman Val DiGiorgio, Carville himself re-tweeted news coverage on Fetterman being labeled a &quot;silver spoon socialist.&quot;

=== U.S. Presidential election, 2024 ===
Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Carville argued in an interview with Maureen Dowd that the Democrats&#x27; political culture had become &quot;too dominated by preachy females&quot;, which he claimed was one reason for Democrats&#x27; waning support with black male voters.

Following U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s poor performance during the June 27, 2024 debate, Carville was among those who called for Biden to end his bid for re-election. In an interview with CNN&#x27;s Jake Tapper on July 1, Carville stated, among other things, &quot;The country wants something new. Let them have it.&quot;

Carville&#x27;s biographical documentary film &quot;&quot;, which debuted at the 2024 Telluride Film Festival before receiving a theatrical release on October 11, 2024, includes the 18 month period where he persuaded Biden to end his re-election. Carville’s position was later vindicated, following Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, eventually lost by Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris.

== Public speaking ==

In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Carville was making more than 100 speeches per year to various audiences, including business groups, colleges and universities and Democratic Party fundraising events. Charles Lewis, executive director at the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington research group, remarked that &quot;No political consultant has carved a space as unique as his.&quot; Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, said at the time: &quot;He&#x27;s become a commodity of himself by design. He&#x27;s a walking conglomerate.&quot; Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary to Bill Clinton, characterized Carville as &quot;a multimedia corporation, and he&#x27;s been smart about it. He is a model of the future. This could not have happened pre-1992 when campaign consultants were viewed by a small audience. Now they are public celebrities.&quot; Carville was noted to have been represented exclusively by the Washington Speakers Bureau, with a speaker&#x27;s fee of $20,500 in 2004 to get him to the podium for an hour, plus first-class expenses and top accommodations.

== Commercial endorsements and advertisements ==
Carville had an array of commercial endorsements, and starred in print media and television advertisements for leading consumer brands including Coca-Cola, Little Debbie snacks, Maker&#x27;s Mark bourbon, Heineken beer, Alka-Seltzer antacid, American Express credit cards, Nike shoes, the Cotton Council, and Ariba software.

In 2000, through Bob Chlopak&#x27;s and Peter Schechter&#x27;s Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter &amp; Associates (CLS), a Washington, DC-based public relations firm, Carville enjoyed a sponsorship with Playboy media and Captain Morgan rum, which included a trip to Hugh Hefner&#x27;s Playboy mansion.

== Personal life ==
Carville is married to political consultant Mary Matalin, who worked for Republican George H. W. Bush on his 1992 presidential reelection campaign. Carville and Matalin were married in New Orleans in October 1993. They have two daughters. In 2008, Carville and Matalin relocated their family from Virginia to New Orleans.

Carville has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and has spoken publicly about ADHD for organizations like Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

Carville sold his house in Uptown New Orleans in May 2021. He temporarily relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, until moving back into New Orleans in June of 2021. Carville still owns his house in Bay St. Louis and frequently visits. In many of his appearances on cable news, he can be seen in his living room there.

<text>Herons are long-legged, long-necked, freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae, with 74 recognised species, some of which are referred to as egrets or bitterns rather than herons. Members of the genus &quot;Botaurus&quot; are referred to as bitterns, and, together with the zigzag heron, or zigzag bittern, in the monotypic genus &quot;Zebrilus&quot;, form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets do not form a biologically distinct group from herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes in breeding plumage. Herons, by evolutionary adaptation, have long beaks.

The classification of the individual heron/egret species is fraught with difficulty, and no clear consensus exists about the correct placement of many species into either of the two major genera, &quot;Ardea&quot; and &quot;Egretta&quot;. Similarly, the relationships of the genera in the family are not completely resolved. However, one species formerly considered to constitute a separate monotypic family, the Cochlearidae or the boat-billed heron, is now regarded as a member of the Ardeidae.

Although herons resemble birds in some other families, such as the storks, ibises, spoonbills, and cranes, they differ from these in flying with their necks retracted, not outstretched. They are also one of the bird groups that have powder down. Some members of this group nest colonially in trees, while others, notably the bitterns, use reed beds. A group of herons has been called a &quot;siege&quot;.

==Name==
The word &quot;heron&quot; first appeared in the English language around 1300, originating from Old French &quot;hairon, eron&quot; (12th century), earlier&quot; hairo &quot;(11th century), from Frankish &quot;haigiro&quot; or from Proto-Germanic &quot;*haigrô&quot;, &quot;*hraigrô&quot;.

Herons are also known as &quot;shitepokes&quot; , or euphemistically as &quot;shikepokes&quot; or &quot;shypokes&quot;. &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; suggests that herons were given this name because of their habit of defecating when flushed.

The 1971 &quot;Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary&quot; describes the use of &quot;shitepoke&quot; for the small green heron of North America (&quot;Butorides virescens&quot;) as originating in the United States, citing a published example from 1853. The &quot;OED&quot; also observes that &quot;shiterow&quot; or &quot;shederow&quot; are terms used for herons, and also applied as derogatory terms meaning a &quot;thin, weakly person&quot;. This name for a heron is found in a list of game birds in a royal decree of James VI (1566–1625) of Scotland. The &quot;OED&quot; speculates that &quot;shiterow&quot; is a corruption of &quot;shiteheron&quot;.

Another former name was &quot;heronshaw&quot; or &quot;hernshaw&quot;, derived from the Old French &quot;heronçeau&quot;. Corrupted to &quot;handsaw&quot;, this name appears in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. A possible further corruption took place in the Norfolk Broads, where the heron is often referred to as a &quot;harnser&quot;.
==Description==
The herons are medium- to large-sized birds with long legs and necks. They exhibit very little sexual dimorphism in size. The smallest species is usually considered the dwarf bittern, which measures in length, although all the species in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; are small and many broadly overlap in size. The largest species of heron is the goliath heron, which stands up to tall. All herons can retract their necks by folding them into a tight S-shape, due to the modified shape of the cervical vertebrae, of which they have 20 or 21; the neck is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The neck is longer in the day herons than the night herons and bitterns. The legs are long and strong, and in almost every species are unfeathered from the lower part of the tibia (the exception is the zigzag heron). In flight, the legs and feet are generally held in a horizontal position, pointing backwards. Toes are long and thin, with three pointing forwards and one backwards.

The bill is generally long and harpoon-like. It can vary from extremely narrow, as in the agami heron, to wider as in the grey heron. The most atypical heron bill is owned by the boat-billed heron, which has a broad, thick bill. Herons&#x27; bills and other bare parts of the body are usually yellow, black, or brown, although this can vary during the breeding season. The wings are broad and long, exhibiting 10 or 11 primary feathers (the boat-billed heron has only nine), 15–20 secondaries, and 12 rectrices (10 in the bitterns). The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue, black, brown, grey, or white, and can often be strikingly complex. Amongst the day herons, little sexual dimorphism in plumage is seen (except in the pond herons); however, for the night herons and smaller bitterns, plumage differences between the sexes are the rule. Many species also have different colour morphs. In the Pacific reef heron, both dark and light colour morphs exist, and the percentage of each morph varies geographically; its white morphs only occur in areas with coral beaches.

==Distribution and habitat==
The herons are a widespread family with a cosmopolitan distribution. They exist on all continents except Antarctica and are present in most habitats except the coldest extremes of the Arctic, extremely high mountains, and the driest deserts. Almost all species are associated with water; they are essentially non-swimming waterbirds that feed on the margins of lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and the sea. They are predominantly found in lowland areas, although some species live in alpine areas, and the majority of species occur in the tropics.

The herons are a highly mobile family, with most species being at least partially migratory; for example, the grey heron is mostly sedentary in Britain, but mostly migratory in Scandinavia. Birds are particularly inclined to disperse widely after breeding, but before the annual migration, where the species is colonial, searching out new feeding areas and reducing the pressures on feeding grounds near the colony. The migration typically occurs at night, usually as individuals or in small groups.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Diet===
Herons, egrets, and bitterns are carnivorous. The members of this family are mostly associated with wetlands and water and feed on a variety of live aquatic prey. Their diet includes a wide variety of aquatic animals, including fish, reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, and aquatic insects. Individual species may be generalists or specialize in certain prey types, such as the yellow-crowned night heron, which specializes in crustaceans, particularly crabs. Many species also opportunistically take larger prey, including birds and bird eggs, rodents, and more rarely carrion. Even more rarely, herons eating acorns, peas, and grains have been reported, but most vegetable matter consumed is accidental.

The most common hunting technique is for the bird to sit motionless on the edge or stand in shallow water and wait until prey comes within range. Birds may either do this from an upright posture, giving them a wider field of view for seeing prey, or from a crouched position, which is more cryptic and means the bill is closer to the prey when it is located. Having seen prey, the head is moved from side to side so that the heron can calculate the position of the prey in the water and compensate for refraction, and then the bill is used to spear the prey.

In addition to sitting and waiting, herons may feed more actively. They may walk slowly, around or less than 60 paces a minute, snatching prey when it is observed. Other active feeding behaviours include foot stirring and probing, where the feet are used to flush out hidden prey. The wings may be used to frighten prey (or possibly attract it to shade) or to reduce glare; the most extreme example of this is exhibited by the black heron, which forms a full canopy with its wings over its body.

Some species of heron, such as the little egret and grey heron, have been documented using bait to lure prey to within striking distance. Herons may use items already in place, or actively add items to the water to attract fish such as the banded killifish. Items used may be man-made, such as bread; alternatively, striated herons in the Amazon have been watched repeatedly dropping seeds, insects, flowers, and leaves into the water to catch fish.

Three species, the black-headed heron, whistling heron, and especially the cattle egret, are less tied to watery environments and may feed far away from water. Cattle egrets improve their foraging success by following large grazing animals, and catching insects flushed by their movement. One study found that the success rate of prey capture increased 3.6 times over solitary foraging.

===Breeding===
While the family exhibits a range of breeding strategies, overall, the herons are monogamous and mostly colonial. Most day herons and night herons are colonial, or partly colonial depending on circumstances, whereas the bitterns and tiger herons are mostly solitary nesters. Colonies may contain several species, as well as other species of waterbirds. In a study of little egrets and cattle egrets in India, the majority of the colonies surveyed contained both species. Nesting is seasonal in temperate species; in tropical species, it may be seasonal (often coinciding with the rainy season) or year-round. Even in year-round breeders, nesting intensity varies throughout the year. Tropical herons typically have only one breeding season per year, unlike some other tropical birds which may raise up to three broods a year.

Courtship usually takes part in the nest. Males arrive first and begin the building of the nest, where they display to attract females. During courtship, the male employs a stretch display and uses erectile neck feathers; the neck area may swell. The female risks an aggressive attack if she approaches too soon and may have to wait up to four days. In colonial species, displays involve visual cues, which can include adopting postures or ritual displays, whereas in solitary species, auditory cues, such as the deep booming of the bitterns, are important. The exception to this is the boat-billed heron, which pairs up away from the nesting site. Having paired, they continue to build the nest in almost all species, although in the little bittern and least bittern, only the male works on the nest.

Some ornithologists have reported observing female herons attaching themselves to impotent mates, then seeking sexual gratification elsewhere.

The nests of herons are usually found near or above water. Although the nests of a few species have been found on the ground where suitable trees or shrubs are unavailable, they are typically placed in vegetation. Trees are used by many species, and here they may be placed high up from the ground, whereas species living in reed beds may nest very close to the ground. Though the majority of nesting of herons is seen in or immediately around water, colonies commonly occur in several cities when human persecution is absent.

Generally, herons lay between three and seven eggs. Larger clutches are reported in the smaller bitterns and more rarely some of the larger day herons, and single-egg clutches are reported for some of the tiger herons. Clutch size varies by latitude within species, with individuals in temperate climates laying more eggs than tropical ones. On the whole, the eggs are glossy blue or white, with the exception being the large bitterns, which lay olive-brown eggs.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Analyses of skeletons, mainly skulls, suggested that the Ardeidae could be split into a diurnal and a crepuscular/nocturnal group which included the bitterns. From DNA studies, and from skeletal analyses that focussed more on bones of the body and limbs, that two-group division has been revealed to be incorrect. Rather, the similarities in the skull morphology among certain herons reflect convergent evolution to cope with the different challenges of daytime and nighttime feeding. Today, it is believed that three major groups can be distinguished, which are:

* tiger herons and the boatbill
* bitterns
* day herons and egrets, and night herons

The night herons may still warrant separation from the day herons and egrets (as subfamily Nycticoracinae, as it was traditionally done). However, the position of some genera (e.g. &quot;Butorides&quot; or &quot;Syrigma&quot;) is unclear at the moment, and molecular studies have so far suffered from studying only a small number of taxa. Especially among the subfamily Ardeinae, the relationships are very inadequately resolved. The arrangement presented here should be considered provisional.

A 2008 study suggests that this family belongs to the Pelecaniformes. In response to these findings, the International Ornithological Congress reclassified Ardeidae and their sister taxa Threskiornithidae under the order Pelecaniformes instead of the previous order of Ciconiiformes.

The cladogram shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the Ardeidae by Jack Hruska and collaborators published in 2023. For several species these results conflict with the taxonomy published online in July 2023 by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The least bittern (&quot;Ixobrychus exilis&quot;) and the stripe-backed bittern (&quot;Ixobrychus involucris&quot;) were nested with members of the genus &quot;Botaurus&quot;. Hruska and collaborators resurrected the genus &quot;Calherodius&quot; Peters, 1931 to contain two night herons (the white-backed night heron and the white-eared night heron) that were previously placed in &quot;Gorsachius&quot;. The western cattle egret (&quot;Bubulcus ibis&quot;) was embedded in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot;. The eastern cattle egret (&quot;Bubulcus coromandus&quot;) was not sampled. The placement of the forest bittern (&quot;Zonerodius heliosylus&quot;) was ambiguous, but the results suggest that it is probably closely related to members of the genus &quot;Ardeola&quot; rather than to the subfamily Tigriornithinae.

As of August 2024 the IOC lists 74 heron species, divided into 18 genera.

*** Easter Island heron, Ardeidae &quot;gen. et sp. indet.&quot; (prehistoric)

; Fossil herons of unresolved affiliations:
* &quot;&quot;Anas&quot; basaltica&quot; (Late Oligocene of Varnsdorf, Czech Republic)
* &quot;Ardeagradis&quot;
* &quot;Proardeola&quot; – possibly same as &quot;Proardea&quot;
* &quot;Matuku&quot; (Early Miocene of Otago, New Zealand)

Other prehistoric and fossil species are included in the respective genus accounts. In addition, &quot;Proherodius&quot; is a disputed fossil which was variously considered a heron or one of the extinct long-legged waterfowl, the Presbyornithidae. It is only known from a sternum; a tarsometatarsus that had been assigned to it actually belongs to the paleognath &quot;Lithornis vulturinus&quot;.

== Symbolic meaning in mysticism ==
In Buddhism, a heron symbolizes purity, transformation, and the wisdom of the Buddha. In addition, as a bird that transcends elements – on the earth, in the water, and the air – the heron symbolizes the expansion of awareness and the ubiquity of consciousness.

In some Native American cultures, this bird symbolizes renewal, rejuvenation, and rebirth – an ever-present reminder that we are all a part of a larger cycle of life and death.

<text>The gens Bruttia was an ancient Roman family during the late Republic and into imperial times. None of the gens obtained any important magistracies until the latter half of the first century AD, when Lucius Bruttius Maximus was proconsul in Cyprus.

==Origin==
The Bruttius probably indicates that the ancestors of the gens were from Bruttium, the southernmost region of Italia. The Bruttii were an Oscan people descended from the Lucani, from whom they asserted their independence during the fourth century BC. The name of &quot;Bruttii&quot;, which they adopted for themselves, may be a pre-Sabellic name meaning &quot;runaways&quot;.

==Praenomina==
The praenomina used by the Bruttii are &quot;Lucius, Gaius&quot;, and &quot;Quintus&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==
No distinct families of the Bruttii appear under the Republic, during which the only cognomen is &quot;Sura&quot;. A number of surnames occur in imperial times, of which all but &quot;Balbus&quot; appear to belong to the same family. The others were &quot;Maximus, Praesens&quot;, and &quot;Crispinus&quot;. This family came from Volceii, in Lucania, and seems to have made a habit of adopting names from the female line. The combination of &quot;Quinctius&quot; or &quot;Quintius Crispinus&quot; probably asserts the family&#x27;s descent from the ancient patrician house of the Quinctii Crispini.

<doc id="237582" wikidata="Q920535" url="?curid=237582" title="Mind Games (John Lennon album)">
<text>Mind Games is the third solo studio album by English musician John Lennon. It was recorded at Record Plant Studios in New York in summer 1973. The album was released in the US on 29 October 1973 and in the UK on 16 November 1973. It was Lennon&#x27;s first self-produced recording without help from Phil Spector. Like his previous album, the politically topical and somewhat abrasive &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;, &quot;Mind Games&quot; received mixed reviews upon release. It reached number 13 in the UK and number 9 in the US, where it was certified gold in both territories.

The album was recorded while Lennon was having difficulties with US immigration and at the beginning of his 18-month separation from Yoko Ono. The title track was released as a single at the same time as the album. The album itself was later reissued several times throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and as an expanded super deluxe box set in 2024.

==Background==
By the start of 1973, John Lennon began distancing himself from the political and social issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, &quot;Feeling the Space&quot;, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono&#x27;s album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for &quot;Mind Games&quot; in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.

Amid frequent court appearances battling to stay in the United States, Lennon became stressed, a situation that was only worsened by constant surveillance by the FBI, due to his political activism. Lennon said, &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t function, you know? I was so paranoid from them tappin&#x27; the phone and followin&#x27; me.&quot; All this combined made Lennon begin to feel emotionally withdrawn. Lennon put his suffering aside to write the songs for &quot;Mind Games&quot;, writing all the songs for it in a week.

Under the moniker of &quot;The Plastic U.F.Ono Band&quot;, Lennon engaged the services of session drummer Jim Keltner, guitarist David Spinozza, Gordon Edwards on bass, Arthur Jenkins on percussion, Michael Brecker on saxophone, Ken Ascher on piano and organ, and the vocal backing of a group called Something Different. Difficulties between Lennon and Ono became more and more noticeable around this time. Just as the sessions were to get under way in June at New York&#x27;s Record Plant Studios, John and Yoko separated. At Ono&#x27;s urging, Pang became Lennon&#x27;s companion and lover in what would become an 18-month relationship later renowned as Lennon&#x27;s &quot;lost weekend&quot;.

==Recording and content==
&quot;Mind Games&quot; was recorded between July and August 1973 in Lennon&#x27;s characteristic quick fashion, and was mixed over a two-week period. Lennon produced the album by himself, following his previous three-year partnership with Phil Spector. When the album was remixed in 2002, many audio anomalies hidden in the original mixing were uncovered. Some rough mixes appear on bootlegs and on 1998&#x27;s &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;.

The album continued Lennon&#x27;s previous attempts to chronicle his life through his songs, the tone of which displays a range of mixed feelings. Among the sombre and melodic songs directed to Ono, &quot;Aisumasen (I&#x27;m Sorry)&quot; was originally titled &quot;Call My Name&quot;, a song in which Lennon was offering to comfort someone, whereas the final version sees him asking for forgiveness. In &quot;One Day (At a Time)&quot;, Lennon sings about his devotion to Ono. &quot;Out the Blue&quot; also reflects Lennon&#x27;s devotion to his wife, and reflects its author&#x27;s self-doubt as a result of their separation. &quot;Out the Blue&quot; incorporates several musical genres, starting with a gentle, melancholy acoustic guitar and moving through gospel, country, and choral music portions. Another love song, &quot;You Are Here&quot; took its title from Lennon&#x27;s one-off art exhibition at the Robert Fraser Gallery. By the time of the &quot;Mind Games&quot; sessions, the composition had gone through several different themes, before Lennon settled on the theme of love and peace. The original master take of &quot;You Are Here&quot; featured an extra verse, that was about Japan and England.

Other songs on the album are more light-hearted and optimistic, marking the return of Lennon&#x27;s humour and wit after the uncompromising doctrine espoused on &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;. These tracks include &quot;Intuition&quot;, in which Lennon relates how life experience has honed his instincts and how it&#x27;s good to have gotten through it. While demoing the song on piano in early 1973, with the lyrics still incomplete, he added a few lines from two previously released tracks – &quot;How?&quot;, from &quot;Imagine&quot; (1971), and &quot;God&quot;, from &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; (1970). &quot;Only People&quot; reflects his and Ono&#x27;s personal philosophy. Lennon later said that it failed as a song, however; in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, he remarked: &quot;It was a good lick, but I couldn&#x27;t get the words to make sense.&quot;

Also appearing on &quot;Mind Games&quot; are songs that indulged Lennon&#x27;s affinity for pure rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, such as &quot;Tight A$&quot;, the title of which was a pun on the expressions &quot;tight as&quot; and &quot;tight ass&quot;. The track is in the rockabilly style with a 1950s sound, along the lines of songs that inspired Lennon in his youth. Another rock track, &quot;Meat City&quot; contains lyrics more in keeping with Lennon&#x27;s earlier penchant for obscure imagery over the personal. The song was a boogie piece until late in 1971, when it began to take its final form, although with improvised lyrics. By late 1972, Lennon had rewritten the words and finished developing the melody.

The song &quot;Mind Games&quot;, with its &quot;love is the answer&quot; refrain and call to &quot;make love not war&quot;, recalls Lennon&#x27;s work with the Beatles in 1967. He started writing the track during the band&#x27;s &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, in early 1969, with the title &quot;Make Love, Not War&quot;. Lennon finished it after reading the book &quot;Mind Games: The Guide to Inner Space&quot;. Lennon had recorded demos of the retitled &quot;Mind Games&quot; on 28 and 29 December 1970, at his home studio, Ascot Sound Studios.

&quot;Bring on the Lucie (Freda Peeple)&quot; dated from late 1971, having started out as little more than a chorus, after Lennon acquired a National guitar. Once he had worked on the lyrics, the song went from a simple political slogan to a full-blown statement that hints at his earlier work, such as &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;Power to the People&quot;. &quot;Only People&quot; and the three-second silent &quot;Nutopian International Anthem&quot; were the only political tracks on the album. The latter referred to &quot;Nutopia: The Country of Peace&quot;, a conceptual country which the Lennons had announced at a press conference in New York City on April Fool&#x27;s Day 1973. &quot;I Know (I Know)&quot; features lyrics in which Lennon apologises for his thoughtlessness and discusses the causes of his insecurity. On some of the rough mixes available on bootlegs, the time-consuming overdubbing on the song is apparent, as Lennon gradually refined the arrangement. The final track on &quot;Mind Games&quot;, &quot;Meat City&quot; contains a Lennon curse, &quot;Fuck a pig!&quot;, sped up and backwards, while the mix used as the B-side to the &quot;Mind Games&quot; single gave the same treatment to the phrase &quot;Check the album!&quot;

&quot;Rock and Roll People&quot; was also recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions and given to Johnny Winter for his &quot;John Dawson Winter III&quot; album. Lennon&#x27;s version remained unreleased until 1986&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Menlove Ave.&quot; album.

==Release and promotion==
Tony King, vice-president of Apple Records in Los Angeles at the time, convinced Lennon to promote &quot;Mind Games&quot;, arranging interviews for Lennon with &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;. He also persuaded Lennon to do a television commercial in which King dressed up as the Queen of the United Kingdom and waltzed with Lennon (the commercial session can be seen in the 1988 film &quot;&quot;). King reprised his role as the Queen for two radio spots promoting the album.

Lennon created the &quot;Mind Games&quot; album cover himself, hand-cutting the photos. The front and back covers are similar; on the back sleeve Lennon is more toward the foreground, representing his symbolic walking away from Ono and her apparent mountainous influence on him.

&quot;Mind Games&quot; was released on 29 October in America and 16 November in Britain, around the same time as Ono&#x27;s &quot;Feeling the Space&quot;. Apple Records issued the title track as a single, with the release dates matching those of the album in the US and UK. The single reached number 26 in the UK, and peaked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US. The album charted at number 13 in the UK and peaked at number 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LP&#x27;s listings. Although &quot;Mind Games&quot; sold better than &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;, its release &quot;came and went with barely a ripple&quot;, according to Beatles biographer Chris Ingham. Author Peter Doggett similarly writes that the album &quot;did nothing to alter [Lennon&#x27;s] status as the least commercially successful Beatle&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Jon Landau of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine assessed the songs on &quot;Mind Games&quot; as &quot;his worst writing yet&quot; and considered that Lennon was &quot;helplessly trying to impose his own gargantuan ego upon an audience ... [that] is waiting hopefully for him to chart a new course&quot;. While finding the music &quot;listenable&quot;, Landau identified the album&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;misguided in so underrating his audience&#x27;s intelligence&quot; and added: &quot;But then, perhaps Lennon&#x27;s didacticism, preaching and banality are part of the mind game of the album&#x27;s title...&quot; More impressed, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Ray Coleman found that &quot;The raw nerves of a Lennon battered by America&#x27;s curious logic and sheer hard-heartedness seem to have spurred him to write incisively...&quot; Coleman concluded of &quot;Mind Games&quot;: &quot;Musically or melodically this may not be a stand-out album, but if you warm to the rasping voice of Lennon and, like me, regard him as the true fulcrum of much of what came from his old group, then like any new Lennon album, it will be enjoyable and even important.&quot; In &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, Robert Christgau described the album as &quot;a step in the right direction... but only a step. It sounds like out-takes from &quot;Imagine&quot;, which may not seem so bad but means that Lennon is falling back on ideas (intellectual and musical) that have lost their freshness for him: Still, the single works, and let&#x27;s hope he keeps right on stepping.&quot;

Writing in their 1975 book &quot;The Beatles: An Illustrated Record&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; journalists Roy Carr and Tony Tyler opined that &quot;Mind Games&quot; &quot;bears all the hallmarks of being made without any definite objective in mind – other than to redeem the unpleasantness of &quot;Some Time In New York City&quot;&quot;. While noting the singer&#x27;s attempts to re-create &quot;the lyricism and melodic inventiveness&quot; of &quot;Imagine&quot;, Carr and Tyler continued: &quot;The reason the total album is not more effective can be laid at the door of Lennon&#x27;s personal situation, and on his tendency to &quot;react&quot; to events, instead of &quot;initiating&quot; them.&quot; In &quot;The Beatles Apart&quot; (1981), Bob Woffinden considered that, aside from the &quot;excellent&quot; title track and &quot;Bring on the Lucie&quot;, &quot;Mind Games&quot; &quot;consisted of so-so songs that hardly lodged in the memory&quot;, and that &quot;The best one can say of the album is that it&#x27;s exceptionally well produced.&quot;

In a more recent review, for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that &quot;confusion... lies at the heart of the album. Lennon doesn&#x27;t know which way to go, so he tries everything.&quot; Erlewine adds: &quot;While the best numbers are among Lennon&#x27;s finest, there&#x27;s only a handful of them, and the remainder of the record is simply pleasant.&quot;

==Reissues==
The album was reissued in the US on Capitol Records in 1978 and 1980, with the latter being a budget reissue. In the UK, the album was reissued on EMI&#x27;s budget label, Music for Pleasure (MFP), on 28 November 1980, featuring a different album cover. After Lennon&#x27;s death in December 1980, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. It was first issued on CD on 3 August 1987, this time on the Parlophone label, and several months later on 22 March 1988 in the US on the Capitol label.

In 2002, a remixing of &quot;Mind Games&quot; for its remastered reissue, containing three previously unreleased demo recordings, was overseen by Allan Rouse, which was released on 21 October 2002 in the UK, and on 5 November 2002 in the US. It was reissued again by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab in 2004 on CD and LP. In 2010, the original mix was remastered as part of the re-release of Lennon&#x27;s entire catalogue, the album was available separately or as part of the &quot;John Lennon Signature Box&quot;.
Expanded versions of &quot;Mind Games&quot; were reissued on 12 July 2024 in several formats, including a super deluxe edition limited to 1100 units worldwide. A six CD &amp; two blu-ray set contains four different mixes of the original album, a fifth disc (actually disc four in the set) of mini audio documentaries of each song &amp; a sixth disc of outtakes. Disc one offers new stereo mixes of the original album created from high-definition transfers of the original multitrack recordings. Disc two&#x27;s &#x27;elemental&#x27; mixes are stripped back and without drums, emphasising Lennon&#x27;s voice. Disc three&#x27;s &#x27;elements&#x27; mixes highlight musician performances. Disc five&#x27;s raw studio mixes is what was recorded during the sessions with minimum effects. A separate coffee table book was released on 24 September.

<doc id="237583" wikidata="Q5188592" url="?curid=237583" title="Crossfire (American TV program)">
<text>Crossfire was an American nightly current event debate television program that aired on CNN from June 25, 1982, to June 3, 2005, and again from September 9, 2013, to August 6, 2014. The format was designed to present and challenge the opinions of a politically liberal pundit and a conservative pundit.

After eight years off the air, a revival of &quot;Crossfire&quot; launched on September 9, 2013. The panelists for the new edition of &quot;Crossfire&quot; were former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and political commentator S. E. Cupp representing the right with political consultant Stephanie Cutter and advocate Van Jones representing the left. The program was last broadcast in July 2014 and officially cancelled later that year.

== Format ==
The show is hosted by two pundits, one of whom is presented as being &quot;on the left&quot; and one &quot;on the right,&quot; to provide two sides of the political spectrum. The show usually features two additional &quot;left and right&quot; guests on each topic of discussion. On some occasions only one guest is featured. Occasionally, when the co-hosts agree on the featured topic, two guests of the opposing view appear. More rarely, when hosts disagree with the prevailing view of their side, they debate someone from their own camp who agrees with it.

== History ==
=== Braden–Buchanan years ===
The concept began in 1978 when Tom Braden and Pat Buchanan co-hosted a radio show on then-NBC-owned WRC radio in Washington. The program, on which the two men debated political issues, was highly praised, but its ratings were low and, in 1982, it was cancelled. At the time, Reese Schonfeld, then President and CEO of CNN, was searching for a replacement for his 10pm program. The program put the day&#x27;s most important newsmaker in the spotlight, caught between a conservative and a liberal journalist. Their ratings, which were low by radio standards, were better than CNN&#x27;s. Schonfeld signed the pair to a CNN contract for $75,000 each.

CNN&#x27;s owner, Ted Turner, objected to their hiring but Braden and Buchanan, with a signed contract, threatened a lawsuit. Turner backed down and agreed to give them a half hour at 11:30pm.

The program&#x27;s original producer was Randy Douthit. It was executive produced by CNN&#x27;s leading female executive, Gail Evans. The show soon gained ratings and was elevated to a 7:30pm time slot. In 1985, Buchanan left the show for a job as communications director in the Reagan White House. His replacement was conservative columnist Robert Novak, who already had a talk show on CNN and was at the time also a regular on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;. In 1987, Buchanan returned to the show, replacing Novak. In 1989, Braden was replaced by Michael Kinsley, a liberal columnist for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

=== Later years ===
In late 1991, Buchanan left the program to pursue the 1992 Republican Party nomination for the presidency, and was replaced by John Sununu in the conservative seat. Buchanan returned in 1993 and alternated with Sununu. In 1995, Buchanan again left the show to pursue an unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Republican nomination for president. Novak returned to the show alternating with Sununu on the right. At about the same time, CNN began a weekend edition of the show, &quot;Crossfire Sunday&quot;. The initial hosts were Bob Beckel on the left and Tony Snow on the right. After a few months Snow left for the newly formed Fox News Channel, to be replaced by Lynne Cheney.

Kinsley left the show at the end of 1995 and in early 1996, CNN selected two hosts to alternate on the left: Geraldine Ferraro and Bill Press. In 1997, Buchanan again returned to the program, replacing Novak on the right. At the end of the year Ferraro left the program and Press became the full-time representative of the left. A month later Sununu left the show, and Novak returned alternating with Buchanan. In February 1998, &quot;Crossfire Sunday&quot; was cancelled. 

In 1999, Buchanan left the show for the last time and Mary Matalin was his replacement, alternating with Novak on the right. However, the show began to lose its audience, with the increasing popularity of alternatives like &quot;Hannity and Colmes&quot; on the Fox News Channel and &quot;Hardball&quot; on MSNBC. In 2001, Matalin left the program to join the White House staff and she was replaced by Tucker Carlson.

In 2002, the length of the program was increased to an hour. The show was presented live from George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and featured a live studio audience. Novak and Carlson retained their slots as alternating hosts on the right. Paul Begala and James Carville replaced Press on the left. The new style did not rate well, and in April 2003, &quot;Crossfire&quot; was reduced back to just half an hour and moved from prime-time to an afternoon slot.

=== Jon Stewart&#x27;s appearance ===

On October 15, 2004, Jon Stewart, then host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, appeared on the program to promote his book &quot;America (The Book): A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Democracy Inaction&quot;. He used his appearance on the show to raise criticisms of the format of &quot;Crossfire&quot; and the style of arguments presented on the show. He said the program failed its responsibility to the public discourse and indulged in partisan hackery, reducing news coverage of important issues to a series of talking points from both extremes of the political spectrum: &quot;It&#x27;s hurting America. Here is what I wanted to tell you guys: Stop.&quot;

Carlson attempted to counter Stewart&#x27;s criticisms by reading examples of softball questions Stewart had asked of then-presidential candidate John Kerry during his recent interview on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, such as &quot;How are you holding up?&quot; and &quot;Is it hard not to take [the attacks] personally?&quot; Stewart argued that unlike Carlson and Begala he was a comedian, not a journalist, and therefore it was not his role to conduct hard-hitting interviews. Begala defended the show on the basis that it was intended as a forum for debate, to which Stewart responded that calling &quot;Crossfire&quot; a debate show was &quot;like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition.&quot; During the exchange, Carlson told Stewart, &quot;I do think you&#x27;re more fun on your show. Just my opinion,&quot; to which Stewart replied, &quot;You know what&#x27;s interesting, though? You&#x27;re as big a dick on your show as you are on any show.&quot;

Following his appearance, transcripts and live stream footage were released on the Internet and widely watched and discussed. At a time when the average number of viewers of the show was about 615,000, the episode drew 867,000 viewers. Stewart later stated &quot;It really was not my intent to be disruptive. I truly thought we&#x27;d have a goof about how terrible the program is at the top, and move on, but . . . the combination of their obstinance and my low blood sugar led to &quot;no bueno&quot;.&quot;

=== Cancellation ===
In January 2005, the new president and CEO of CNN Jonathan Klein announced the cancellation of &quot;Crossfire&quot;. Klein also announced that they would not be renewing Carlson&#x27;s contract. Carlson claimed it was he who had chosen to leave, to take a job at MSNBC. In the news release containing the announcement, Klein indicated that he wanted to change the tone of shows on the network, and in interviews said he sympathized with Jon Stewart&#x27;s criticisms of &quot;Crossfire&quot;. Klein claimed he &quot;wanted to move CNN away from what he called &#x27;head-butting debate shows&#x27;.&quot; The last episode aired on June 3, 2005 and the &quot;Crossfire&quot; pundits began appearing on &quot;Inside Politics&quot; the following Monday before relocating to that show&#x27;s successor, &quot;The Situation Room&quot;. However, the GWU &quot;Crossfire&quot; set remained in use for the CNN weekend program &quot;On The Story&quot;, which had an audience interaction format.

=== Revival ===
A revival of &quot;Crossfire&quot; was announced on June 26, 2013, for a premiere in late 2013, with panelists Newt Gingrich, S. E. Cupp, Stephanie Cutter, and Van Jones. CNN announced a launch of September 9, at the end of the Congressional recess and probable proposal by the White House to take some action against Syria.

The new version differed from the original version in that the final segment, called &quot;Cease Fire,&quot; will offer &quot;an opportunity for hosts to look for common ground at the end of the program.&quot; There is also no audience, putting aside the format in the first version&#x27;s iteration in the last few years to prevent the panelists from &quot;playing for the audience&quot;.

Due to CNN&#x27;s coverage of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappearance, &quot;Crossfire&quot; was placed on &quot;temporary hiatus&quot; on March 11, 2014; an additional half-hour of &quot;The Situation Room&quot; was aired in its place. &quot;Crossfire&quot; returned to CNN&#x27;s lineup on May 1, 2014. Following the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 incident in mid-July 2014, &quot;Crossfire&quot; was placed on hiatus again. On October 15, 2014—coincidentally, the ten-year anniversary of Stewart&#x27;s appearance—the show was officially cancelled for the second time.

<doc id="237585" wikidata="Q1148337" url="?curid=237585" title="Hepatocellular carcinoma">
<text>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis. HCC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
HCC most commonly occurs in those with chronic liver disease especially those with cirrhosis or fibrosis, which occur in the setting of chronic liver injury and inflammation. HCC is rare in those without chronic liver disease. Chronic liver diseases which greatly increase the risk of HCC include hepatitis infection such as (hepatitis B, C or D), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease, or exposure to toxins such as aflatoxin, or pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Certain diseases, such as hemochromatosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, markedly increase the risk of developing HCC. The five-year survival in those with HCC is 18%.
As with any cancer, the treatment and prognosis of HCC varies depending on tumor histology, size, how far the cancer has spread, and overall health of the person.
The vast majority of HCC cases and the lowest survival rates after treatment occur in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, in countries where hepatitis B infection is endemic and many are infected from birth. The incidence of HCC in the United States and other higher income countries is increasing due to an increase in hepatitis C virus infections. The incidence of HCC due to NASH has also risen sharply in the past 20 years, with NASH being the fastest growing cause of HCC. This is thought to be due to an increased prevalence of NASH, as well as its risk factors of diabetes and obesity, in higher income countries. It is more than three times as common in males as in females, for unknown reasons.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most cases of HCC occur in people who already have signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease. They may present with worsening symptoms or without symptoms at the time of cancer detection. HCC may present with non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or feeling tired. Some symptoms that are more closely associated with liver disease include yellow skin (also called jaundice), abdominal swelling due to fluid in the abdominal cavity, easy bruising from blood clotting abnormalities, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or feeling tired.

==Risk factors==
Since HCC mostly occurs in people with cirrhosis of the liver, risk factors generally include factors which cause chronic liver disease that may lead to cirrhosis. Certain risk factors are more highly associated with HCC than others. For example, while heavy alcohol consumption is estimated to cause 60–70% of cirrhosis, the vast majority of HCC occurs in cirrhosis attributed to viral hepatitis (although there may be overlap). Recognized risk factors include:
* Chronic viral hepatitis (estimated cause of 80% cases globally)
** Chronic hepatitis B (about 50% cases)
** Chronic hepatitis C (about 25% cases)
* Toxins:
** Alcohol use disorder: the most common cause of cirrhosis
** Aflatoxin
** Iron overload state (hemochromatosis)
** Pyrrolizidine alkaloids
* Metabolic:
** Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: up to 20% progress to cirrhosis
** Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
** Type 2 diabetes (probably aided by obesity)
* Congenital disorders:
** Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
** Wilson&#x27;s disease (controversial; while some theorise the risk increases, case studies are rare and suggest the opposite where Wilson&#x27;s disease actually may confer protection)
** Hemophilia, although statistically associated with higher risk of HCC, this is due to coincident chronic viral hepatitis infection related to repeated blood transfusions over lifetime.

The significance of these risk factors varies globally. In regions where hepatitis B infection is endemic, such as southeast China, hepatitis B is the predominant cause. In populations largely protected by hepatitis B vaccination, such as the United States, HCC is most often linked to causes of cirrhosis such as chronic hepatitis C, obesity, and excessive alcohol use.

Certain benign liver tumors, such as hepatocellular adenoma, may sometimes be associated with coexisting malignant HCC. Evidence is limited for the true incidence of malignancy associated with benign adenomas; however, the size of hepatic adenoma is considered to correspond to risk of malignancy and so larger tumors may be surgically removed. Certain subtypes of adenoma, particularly those with β-catenin activation mutation, are particularly associated with increased risk of HCC.

Chronic liver disease is rare in children and adolescents; however, congenital liver disorders are associated with an increased the chance of developing HCC. Specifically, children with biliary atresia, infantile cholestasis, glycogen-storage diseases, and other cirrhotic diseases of the liver are predisposed to developing HCC in childhood.

Young adults afflicted by the rare fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma may have none of the typical risk factors, such as cirrhosis and hepatitis.

=== Diabetes mellitus ===

The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in type 2 diabetics is greater (from 2.5 to 7.1 times the nondiabetic risk) depending on the duration of diabetes and treatment protocol. A suspected contributor to this increased risk is circulating insulin concentration such that diabetics with poor insulin control or on treatments that elevate their insulin output (both states that contribute to a higher circulating insulin concentration) show far greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma than diabetics on treatments that reduce circulating insulin concentration. On this note, some diabetics who engage in tight insulin control (by keeping it from being elevated) show risk levels low enough to be indistinguishable from the general population. This phenomenon is thus not isolated to diabetes mellitus type 2, since poor insulin regulation is also found in other conditions such as metabolic syndrome (specifically, when evidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD is present) and again evidence of greater risk exists here, too. While there are claims that anabolic steroid abusers are at greater risk (theorized to be due to insulin and IGF exacerbation), the only evidence that has been confirmed is that anabolic steroid users are more likely to have the benign hepatocellular adenomas transform into the more dangerous hepatocellular carcinoma.

== Pathogenesis ==

Hepatocellular carcinoma, like any other cancer, develops when epigenetic alterations and mutations affecting the cellular machinery cause the cell to replicate at a higher rate and/or result in the cell avoiding apoptosis. In particular, chronic infections of hepatitis B and/or C can aid the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by repeatedly causing the body&#x27;s own immune system to attack the liver cells, some of which are infected by the virus, others merely bystanders. Activated immune-system inflammatory cells release free radicals, such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide reactive species, which in turn can cause DNA damage and lead to carcinogenic gene mutations. Reactive oxygen species also cause epigenetic alterations at the sites of DNA repair.

Many genes responsible for cell proliferation, apoptosis or cell senescence and differentiation are commonly mutated in HCC and are implicated in tumor formation. Mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter are seen in 47-60% of HCC cases. The HBV genome commonly inserts into hepatocytes&#x27; TERT promoter site contributing to oncogenesis. These mutations in the promoter of TERT lead to a constitutively active telomerase which maintains telomere length and contributes to cell immortality. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are seen in about 30% of cases of HCC. And mutations in Wnt signalling (which is responsible for embryogenesis and cell homeostasis) are also seen in HCC, specifically CTNNB1 mutations seen in 30% of cases and AXIN1 mutations seen in 10% of cases. Mutations of genes involved in chromatin remodeling such as ARID1A and ARID2 are also seen in 10% and 5% of HCC cases respectively.

While this constant cycle of damage followed by repair can lead to mistakes during repair, which in turn lead to carcinogenesis, this hypothesis is more applicable, at present, to hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C causes HCC through the stage of cirrhosis. In chronic hepatitis B, however, the integration of the viral genome into infected cells can directly induce a noncirrhotic liver to develop HCC. Alternatively, repeated consumption of large amounts of ethanol can have a similar effect. The toxin aflatoxin from certain &quot;Aspergillus&quot; species of fungi is a carcinogen and aids carcinogenesis of hepatocellular cancer by building up in the liver. The combined high prevalence of rates of aflatoxin and hepatitis B in settings such as China and West Africa has led to relatively high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma in these regions. Other viral hepatitides such as hepatitis A have no potential to become a chronic infection, thus are not related to HCC.

==Diagnosis==

Methods of diagnosis in HCC have evolved with the improvement in medical imaging. The evaluation of both asymptomatic patients and those with symptoms of liver disease involves blood testing and imaging evaluation. Historically, a biopsy of a tumor was required to prove an HCC diagnosis. However, imaging (especially MRI) findings may be conclusive enough without histopathologic confirmation.

===Screening===
HCC remains associated with a high mortality rate, in part because initial diagnosis commonly occurs at an advanced stage of disease. As with other cancers, outcomes are significantly improved if treatment is initiated earlier in the disease process. Since the vast majority of HCC cases occur in people with certain chronic liver diseases, especially those with cirrhosis, liver cancer screening is recommended in this population. In the United States, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases(AASLD) recommends ultrasound screenings every six months for people with cirrhosis, with or without measurement of blood levels of the tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Elevated levels of AFP are associated with active HCC disease, though their reliability can be inconsistent. At levels &gt;20, sensitivity is 41–65% and specificity is 80–94%. However, at levels &gt;200, sensitivity is 31% and specificity is 99%.

On ultrasound, HCC often appears as a small hypoechoic lesion with poorly defined margins and coarse, irregular internal echoes. When the tumor grows, it can sometimes appear heterogeneous with fibrosis, fatty change, and calcifications. This heterogeneity can look similar to cirrhosis and the surrounding liver parenchyma. A systematic review found that the sensitivity was 60% and specificity was 97% as compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the reference standard. The sensitivity increases to 79% with AFP correlation. Hepatic nodules that are less than 1 centimeter in size on surveillance ultrasound require serial imaging to ensure stability and to monitor for potential transformation to HCC.

Controversy remains as to the most effective screening protocols. For example, while some data support decreased mortality related to screening people with hepatitis B infection, the AASLD notes, “There are no randomized trials [for screening] in Western populations with cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C or fatty liver disease, and thus there is some controversy surrounding whether surveillance truly leads to a reduction in mortality in this population of patients with cirrhosis.”

===Higher risk people===
In a person where a higher suspicion of HCC exists, such as a person with symptoms or abnormal blood tests (i.e. alpha-fetoprotein and des-gamma carboxyprothrombin levels), evaluation requires imaging of the liver by CT or MRI scans. Optimally, these scans are performed with intravenous contrast in multiple phases of hepatic perfusion to improve detection and accurate classification of any liver lesions. Due to the characteristic blood flow pattern of HCC tumors, a specific perfusion pattern of any detected liver lesion may conclusively detect an HCC tumor. Alternatively, the scan may detect an indeterminate lesion and further evaluation may be performed by obtaining a biopsy of the lesion.

===Imaging===

Ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI may be used to evaluate the liver for HCC. On CT and MRI, HCC can have three distinct patterns of growth:
* A single large tumor
* Multiple tumors
* Poorly defined tumor with an infiltrative growth pattern

A systematic review of CT diagnosis found that the sensitivity was 68% (95% CI 55–80%) and specificity was 93% (95% CI 89–96%) compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the reference standard. With triple-phase helical CT, the sensitivity was 90% or higher, but these data have not been confirmed with autopsy studies.

However, MRI has the advantage of delivering high-resolution images of the liver without ionizing radiation. HCC appears as a high-intensity pattern on T2-weighted images and a low-intensity pattern on T1-weighted images. The advantage of MRI is that it has improved sensitivity and specificity when compared to ultrasound and CT in cirrhotic patients with whom it can be difficult to differentiate HCC from regenerative nodules. A systematic review found that the sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 70–91%) and specificity was 85% (95% CI 77–93%) compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the reference standard. The sensitivity is further increased if gadolinium contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging are combined.

MRI is more sensitive and specific than CT.

Liver image reporting and data system (LI-RADS) is a classification system for the reporting of liver lesions detected on CT and MRI. Radiologists use this standardized system to report on suspicious lesions and to provide an estimated likelihood of malignancy. Categories range from LI-RADS (LR) 1 to 5, in order of concern for cancer. A biopsy is not needed to confirm the diagnosis of HCC if certain imaging criteria are met.

===Pathology===

Macroscopically, liver cancer appears as a nodular or infiltrative tumor. The nodular type may be solitary (large mass) or multiple (when developed as a complication of cirrhosis). Tumor nodules are round to oval, gray or green (if the tumor produces bile), well circumscribed but not encapsulated. The diffuse type is poorly circumscribed and infiltrates the portal veins, or the hepatic veins (rarely).

Microscopically, the four architectural and cytological types (patterns) of hepatocellular carcinoma are: fibrolamellar, (adenoid), pleomorphic (giant cell), and clear cell. In well-differentiated forms, tumor cells resemble hepatocytes, form trabeculae, cords, and nests, and may contain bile pigment in the cytoplasm. In poorly differentiated forms, malignant epithelial cells are discohesive, pleomorphic, anaplastic, and giant. The tumor has a scant stroma and central necrosis because of the poor vascularization. A fifth form – lymphoepithelioma like hepatocellular carcinoma – has also been described.

===Staging===
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Staging System

The prognosis of HCC is affected by the staging of the tumor, the liver&#x27;s function due to the effects of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis as well as the person&#x27;s physical performance status.

A number of staging classifications for HCC are available. However, due to the unique nature of the carcinoma to fully encompass all the features that affect the categorization of the HCC, a classification system should incorporate tumor size and number, presence of vascular invasion and extrahepatic spread, liver function (levels of serum bilirubin and albumin, presence of ascites, and portal hypertension) and general health status of the patient (defined by the ECOG classification) and the presence of symptoms.

Of all the staging classification systems available, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification encompasses all of the above characteristics. This staging classification can be used to guide treatment decisions.

Important features that guide treatment include:
* size
* spread (stage)
* involvement of liver vessels
* presence of a tumor capsule
* presence of extrahepatic metastases
* presence of daughter nodules
* vascularity of the tumor

The most common sites of metastasis are the lung, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone.

==Prevention==
Since hepatitis B and C are some of the main causes of hepatocellular carcinoma, prevention of infection is key to then prevent HCC. Thus, childhood vaccination against hepatitis B may reduce the risk of liver cancer in the future. In those with chronic hepatitis C infection, treatment of the hepatitis C using medications reduces the risk of developing HCC.

In the case of patients with cirrhosis, alcohol consumption is to be avoided. Also, screening for hemochromatosis may be beneficial for some patients. HCC surveillance in those with chronic liver disease with cirrhosis is indicated and generally consists of a twice-yearly ultrasound with or without Alpha-fetoprotein lab testing. The utility of HCC surveillance or screening in those with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis is less well established.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma varies by the stage of disease, a person&#x27;s likelihood to tolerate surgery, and availability of liver transplantation:
# Curative intention: for limited disease, when the cancer is limited to one or more areas of within the liver, surgically removing the malignant cells may be curative. This may be accomplished by resection the affected portion of the liver (partial hepatectomy) or in some cases by orthotopic liver transplantation of the entire organ.
# &quot;Bridging&quot; intention: for limited disease which qualifies for potential liver transplantation, the person may undergo targeted treatment of some or all of the known tumor while waiting for a donor organ to become available.
# &quot;Downstaging&quot; intention: for moderately advanced disease which has not spread beyond the liver, but is too advanced to qualify for curative treatment. The person may be treated by targeted therapies in order to reduce the size or number of active tumors, with the goal of once again qualifying for liver transplant after this treatment.
# Palliative intention: for more advanced disease, including spread of cancer beyond the liver or in persons who may not tolerate surgery, treatment intended to decrease symptoms of disease and maximize duration of survival.

Loco-regional therapy (also referred to as liver-directed therapy) refers to any one of several minimally-invasive treatment techniques to focally target HCC within the liver. These procedures are alternatives to surgery, and may be considered in combination with other strategies, such as a later liver transplantation. Generally, these treatment procedures are performed by interventional radiologists or surgeons, in coordination with a medical oncologist. Loco-regional therapy may refer to either percutaneous therapies (e.g. cryoablation), or arterial catheter-based therapies (chemoembolization or radioembolization).

=== Surgical resection ===
Surgical resection of HCC tumors is usually the preferred treatment for BCLC stage 0 or A disease. Surgical resection is associated with a greater than 60% survival rate at 5 years and a recurrence rate greater than 70%. Surgical removal of the tumor is associated with better cancer prognosis, but only 5–15% of patients are suitable for surgical resection due to the extent of disease or poor liver function. Surgery is only considered if the entire tumor can be safely removed while preserving sufficient functional liver to maintain normal physiology. Thus, preoperative imaging assessment is critical to determine both the extent of HCC and to estimate the amount of residual liver remaining after surgery. To maintain liver function, residual liver volume should exceed 25% of total liver volume in a noncirrhotic liver, greater than 40% in a cirrhotic liver. Surgery on diseased or cirrhotic livers is generally associated with higher morbidity and mortality. The Singapore Liver Cancer Recurrence score can be used to estimate risk of recurrence after surgery.

=== Liver transplantation ===
Liver transplantation, replacing the diseased liver with a cadaveric or a living donor liver, plays an increasing role in treatment of HCC. Although outcomes following liver transplant were initially poor (20%–36% survival rate), outcomes have significantly improved with improvement in surgical techniques and adoption of the Milan criteria at transplantation centers. Expanded Shanghai criteria in China have resulted in overall survival and disease-free survival rates similar to those achieved using the Milan criteria. Studies from the late 2000s obtained higher survival rates ranging from 67% to 91%. Other estimates of 5 year survival after liver transplantation range from 60 to 60% with a 50% survival rate at 10 years. The risk of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation is less than 15%. Macrovascular or extrahepatic spread (spread of the cancer to blood vessels or outside the liver, respectively) are contraindications to liver transplantation.

The risks of liver transplantation extend beyond risk of the procedure itself. The immunosuppressive medication required after surgery to prevent rejection of the donor liver also impairs the body&#x27;s natural ability to combat dysfunctional cells. If the tumor has spread undetected outside the liver before the transplant, the medication effectively increases the rate of disease progression and decreases survival. Liver transplantation can be a curative approach for patients with advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis. Among patients with compensated cirrhosis, transplantation is not associated with improved survival compared to hepatectomy, but instead is significantly more expensive.

=== Ablation ===
* Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses high-frequency radio waves to destroy tumors by local heating. The electrodes are inserted into the liver tumor under ultrasound guidance using percutaneous, laparoscopic or open surgical approach. It is suitable for small tumors 2 centimeters or less. RFA may be used in those with stage 0 or A disease, especially in those who are not candidates for resection. RFA has the best outcomes in patients with a solitary tumor less than 4 cm. Since it is a local treatment and has minimal effect on normal healthy tissue, it can be repeated multiple times. Survival is better for those with smaller tumors. In one series of 302 patients, the three-year survival rates for lesions &gt;5 cm, 2.1 to 5 cm, and ≤2 cm were 59, 74, and 91%, respectively. A large randomized trial comparing surgical resection and RFA for small HCC showed similar four-year survival and less morbidities for patients treated with RFA. Ablation methods (usually RF ablation) or arterial based treatments may be used on those awaiting liver transplantation to lower tumor burden (Milan score) and improve treatment response. It may also be used to reduce tumor burden making one eligible for liver transplantation.
* Cryoablation is a technique used to destroy the tumor using cold temperatures. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe into the center of the tumor and freezing the tumor using liquid nitrogen. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection, as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.
* Percutaneous ethanol injection is well tolerated in small (&lt;3 cm) solitary tumors. Local therapy can achieve a 5-year survival rate around 60% for patients with small HCC.

=== Arterial catheter-based treatment ===
* Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) may be used in BCLC stage B disease and for un-resectable tumors or as a temporary treatment while waiting for liver transplant (&quot;bridge to transplant&quot;). TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure is to restrict the tumor&#x27;s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE has been shown to increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists. The median survival after TACE is 26–40 months with a tumor response rate of approximately 52%. Combining TACE with systemic therapy (sorafenib or brivanib) does not improve survival. The risk of death after transarterial treatments, including TACE, is about 1%, usually due to liver failure.
* Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) can be used to destroy the tumor using selective injection of the artery or arteries supplying the tumor with a radioisotope agent. The agent is typically Yttrium-90 (Y-90) incorporated into embolic microspheres that lodge in the tumor vasculature, causing ischemia and delivering their radiation dose directly to the lesion with the intention of sparing the surrounding liver. Based on limited evidence, SIRT has similar efficacy to TACE. Two products are available, SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere. The latter is an FDA-approved treatment for primary liver cancer which has been shown in clinical trials to increase the survival rate of low-risk patients. SIR-Spheres are FDA-approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, but outside the US, SIR-Spheres are approved for the treatment of any nonresectable liver cancer including primary liver cancer.

===External beam therapy===
* The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma has evolved as technological advancements in treatment delivery and imaging have provided a means for safe and effective radiotherapy delivery in a wide spectrum of HCC patients. In metastatic cases, radiotherapy can be used for palliative care.
* Proton therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with improved survival relative to photon-based radiation therapy which may be driven by decreased incidence of post-treatment liver decompensation.

===Systemic===
Systemic therapy for HCC is indicated in BCLC stage C disease, in which cancer has spread beyond the liver. It is also indicated in BCLC stage B disease with tumor progression after local treatments. In 2007, sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, was the first systemic agent approved for first-line treatment of advanced HCC. Trials have found modest improvement in overall survival: 10.7 months vs 7.9 months and 6.5 months vs 4.2 months.

The most common side effects of Sorafenib include a hand-foot skin reaction and diarrhea. Sorafenib is thought to work by blocking growth of both tumor cells and new blood vessels. Numerous other molecular targeted drugs are being tested as alternative first- and second-line treatments for advanced HCC, such as lenvatinib and regorafenib. Regorafenib increased survival from 7.8 to 10.6 months in those who had tumor progression while on sorafenib compared to placebo.

Cabozantinib, which is an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including VEGFR, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) and AXL and ramucirumab, an antibody directed against VEGF receptor 2, are second line therapies which have been shown to reduce the risk of death compared to placebo.

A host of additional targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been found to be effective. For instance, in the recent phase III trial IMBrave 150, the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab was found to improve both overall and progression-free survival compared to sorafenib alone.

Tremelimumab (Imjudo) was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2022. It is indicated, in combination with durvalumab, for the treatment of adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

===Other===
* Portal vein embolization (PVE): This technique is sometimes used to increase the volume of healthy liver, in order to improve chances of survival following surgical removal of diseased liver. For example, embolization of the right main portal vein would result in compensatory hypertrophy of the left lobe, which may qualify the patient for a partial hepatectomy. Embolization is performed by an interventional radiologist using a percutaneous transhepatic approach. This procedure can also serve as a bridge to transplant.
* High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) (as opposed to diagnostic ultrasound) is an experimental technique which uses high-powered ultrasound waves to destroy tumor tissue.
* A systematic review assessed 12 articles involving a total of 318 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with Yttrium-90 radioembolization. Excluding a study of only one patient, post-treatment CT evaluation of the tumor showed a response ranging from 29 to 100% of patients evaluated, with all but two studies showing a response of 71% or greater.

==Prognosis==

The usual outcome is poor because only 10–20% of hepatocellular carcinomas can be removed completely using surgery. If the cancer cannot be completely removed, the disease is usually deadly within 3 to 6 months. This is partially due to late presentation with tumors, but also the lack of medical expertise and facilities in the regions with high HCC prevalence. However, survival can vary, and occasionally people survive much longer than 6 months. The prognosis for metastatic or unresectable HCC has improved due to the approval of Sorafenib (Nexavar®) for advanced HCC.

== Epidemiology ==
HCC is one of the most common tumors worldwide. The epidemiology of HCC exhibits two main patterns, one in North America and Western Europe and another in non-Western countries, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, and the Amazon basin. Males are affected more than females usually, and it is most common between the ages of 30 and 50, Hepatocellular carcinoma causes 662,000 deaths worldwide per year about half of them in China.

=== Africa and Asia ===
In some parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, HCC is the most common cancer, generally affecting men more than women, and with an age of onset between the late teens and 30s. This variability is in part due to the different patterns of hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission in different populations – infection at or around birth predispose to earlier cancers than if people are infected later. The time between hepatitis B infection and development into HCC can be years, even decades, but from diagnosis of HCC to death, the average survival period is only 5.9 months according to one Chinese study during the 1970-80s, or 3 months (median survival time) in sub-Saharan Africa according to Manson&#x27;s textbook of tropical diseases. HCC is one of the deadliest cancers in China, where chronic hepatitis B is found in 90% of cases. In Japan, chronic hepatitis C is associated with 90% of HCC cases. Foods infected with &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; (especially peanuts and corns stored during prolonged wet seasons) which produces aflatoxins pose another risk factor for HCC.
=== North America and Western Europe ===

The most common malignant tumors in the liver represent metastases (spread) from tumors which originate elsewhere in the body. Among cancers that originate from liver tissue, HCC is the most common primary liver cancer. In the United States, the US surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database program, shows that HCC accounts for 65% of all cases of liver cancers. As screening programs are in place for high-risk persons with chronic liver disease, HCC is often discovered much earlier in Western countries than in developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa.

Acute and chronic hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria) and tyrosinemia type I are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis of an acute hepatic porphyria (AIP, HCP, VP) should be sought in patients with HCC without typical risk factors of hepatitis B or C, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, or hemochromatosis. Both active and latent genetic carriers of acute hepatic porphyrias
are at risk for this cancer, although latent genetic carriers have developed the cancer at a later age than those with classic symptoms. Patients with acute hepatic porphyrias should be monitored for HCC.

The incidence of HCC is relatively lower in the Western Hemisphere than in Eastern Asia. However, despite the statistics being low, the diagnosis of HCC has increased since the 1980s and it is continuing to increase, making it one of the rising causes of death due to cancer. The common risk factor for HCC is hepatitis C, along with other health issues.

== Research ==

===Preclinical===
Mipsagargin (G-202), has orphan drug designation as a treatment during chemotherapy for HCC. It is a thapsigargin-based prodrug with cytotoxic activity used to reduce blood flow to the tumor during treatment. Results from Phase 2 trial recommended G-202 as a first-in-class PSMA-targeted prodrug and that it move to clinical trials.

Current research includes the search for the genes that are disregulated in HCC, antiheparanase antibodies, protein markers, non-coding RNAs (such as TUC338) and other predictive biomarkers. As similar research is yielding results in various other malignant diseases, it is hoped that identifying the aberrant genes and the resultant proteins could lead to the identification of pharmacological interventions for HCC.

The development of three-dimensional culture methods provides a new approach for preclinical studies of cancer therapy using patient-derived organoids. These miniaturized organoid &#x27;avatars&#x27; of a patient&#x27;s tumor recapitulate several features of the original tumor, rendering them an attractive model for drug-sensitivity testing and precision medicine for HCC and other types of primary liver cancer.

Furthermore, HCC occurs in patients with liver disease. A biomarker named six-miRNA signature allows effective treatment of patients with HCC and is able to predict its recurrence in the liver.

A prospective study found that increased hepatocellular cancer risk is associated with higher levels of major circulating bile acids that were measured in people several years prior to tumor diagnosis. In another study using a mouse model, it was found that dysregulated hepatic bile acids collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis. Evidence was reviewed that alterations in bile acids by the human gut microbiome can contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. The gut microbiota that contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma appear to be distinct from those causing colorectal cancer.

===Clinical===
JX-594, an oncolytic virus, has orphan drug designation for this condition and is undergoing clinical trials. Hepcortespenlisimut-L (Hepko-V5), an oral cancer vaccine, also has US FDA orphan drug designation for HCC. Immunitor Inc. completed a Phase II trial, published in 2017. A randomized trial of people with advanced HCC showed no benefit for the combination of everolimus and pasireotide.

<doc id="237586" wikidata="Q3094569" url="?curid=237586" title="Galen Rowell">
<text>Galen Avery Rowell (August 23, 1940 – August 11, 2002) was an American wilderness photographer, adventure photojournalist and mountaineer. Born in Oakland, California, he became a full-time photographer in 1972.

==Early life and education==

Rowell was introduced to the wilderness at a very young age and he completed his first roped climb in Yosemite Valley when he was 16. For the rest of his life, he climbed mountains and explored landscapes. He began taking pictures on excursions into the wild so that he could share his experiences with friends and family. After graduating from Berkeley High School in 1958, he stayed in Berkeley to study at the University of California but dropped out to pursue climbing.

==Career==
In 1972, Rowell sold his small automotive business and became a full-time photographer. Within a year, he had completed his first major assignment, published as the June 1974 cover story for &quot;National Geographic&quot;. The story originated from an invitation by fellow photographer Dewitt Jones to help him on an assignment, when Jones was called away and Rowell suggested an ascent of Yosemite National Park&#x27;s Half Dome that he documented by himself. When &quot;National Geographic&quot; received the pictures, they decided to do a story separate from Jones&#x27;, thus Rowell got his start. He pioneered a new kind of photography in which he was not merely an observer, but considered himself a participant in the scenes that he photographed – he considered the landscape part of the adventure, and the adventure part of the landscape.

Rowell won the Ansel Adams Award for Conservation Photography in 1984. He had numerous photographic assignments for &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;Outdoor Photographer&quot;, and various other publications. Rowell was also a highly regarded writer on subjects ranging from photography, humanitarian and environmental issues, human visual cognition, and mountaineering, publishing numerous magazine articles and eighteen books in his lifetime. His &quot;In the Throne Room of the Mountain Gods&quot; about the history of mountaineering on K2 (1977) is considered a classic of mountaineering literature, and his 1986 book &quot;Mountain Light: In Search of the Dynamic Landscape&quot; is one of the best selling how-to photo books. As an energetic advocate for the causes in which he believed, Rowell served on multiple advisory and directors&#x27; boards for organizations ranging from the Committee of 100 for Tibet to the World Wildlife Fund.

Rowell was particularly keen on seeking out and photographing optical phenomena in the natural world. He referred to his landscape photographs as &quot;dynamic landscapes,&quot; due to both the fast-changing nature of light and conditions and his energetic pursuit of the best camera position at the optimal moment. Rowell wrote about the quest for such images in &quot;Mountain Light&quot;, and also in &quot;Galen Rowell&#x27;s Vision&quot; (1993) and &quot;Inner Game of Outdoor Photography&quot; (2001).
A retrospective book on his life, career, and impact on the various worlds he touched was published by Sierra Club Books.

===Photography techniques and equipment===
From 1968, he used 35mm Nikon cameras and lenses almost exclusively for their reliability and portability. His primary medium was color slide film, beginning with Kodachrome in the late 1960s through the 1980s, and Fuji Velvia following its introduction in 1990.

Rowell conceived a technical approach of extending the dynamic range captured on film. He developed a set of graduated neutral density filters produced by filter manufacturer Singh-Ray. They were sold under his name and became a standard for dealing with high contrast scenes.

Galen Rowell mastered the technique of using balanced fill flash, allowing him to subtly lighten the deepest shadows to match the relatively narrow dynamic range of color reversal film.

==Death==
Rowell, his wife – photographer, author and pilot Barbara Cushman Rowell – pilot Tom Reid, and Reid&#x27;s friend Carol McAffee were all killed in a plane crash in Inyo County near Eastern Sierra Regional Airport in Bishop, California, at 01:23 am on August 11, 2002. The Rowells were returning from a photography workshop in the Bering Sea area of Alaska on a flight that had originated in Oakland, California. The National Transportation Safety Board determined (NTSB report LAX02FA251) that Reid had only 52 hours in the Aero Commander 690 and only 1.6 hours at night. He was not certified for carrying passengers at night at the time of the accident. The aircraft crashed during the turn from base to final approach for runway 30, within a quarter mile of the runway threshold. The Rowells&#x27; business, Mountain Light Photography Gallery in Bishop, California, continued to operate (owned by Galen&#x27;s children Nicole Ryan and Tony Rowell, and Barbara&#x27;s brother Robert Cushman) until October 2017, first under General Manager and Curator Justin Black until June 2009, and subsequently under General Manager Kevin Calder until 2017.

==Awards==
Rowell was the winner of the Sierra Club&#x27;s Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award for 1977.

In 1984, the Sierra Club honored Rowell with the Ansel Adams Award for Conservation Photography. https://www.sierraclub.org/library/collections/fine-art/ansel-adams-award

He was inducted into the California Outdoors Hall of Fame preceding his death in 2002. https://www.https://www.cohof.org/biographies/galen-rowell

Rowell was posthumously inducted into the fellowship of the International League of Conservation Photographers as an Honorary Fellow in 2009.

<doc id="237587" wikidata="Q596577" url="?curid=237587" title="Dissipative system">
<text>A dissipative system is a thermodynamically open system which is operating out of, and often far from, thermodynamic equilibrium in an environment with which it exchanges energy and matter. A tornado may be thought of as a dissipative system. Dissipative systems stand in contrast to conservative systems.

A dissipative structure is a dissipative system that has a dynamical regime that is in some sense in a reproducible steady state. This reproducible steady state may be reached by natural evolution of the system, by artifice, or by a combination of these two.

== Overview ==
A dissipative structure is characterized by the spontaneous appearance of symmetry breaking (anisotropy) and the formation of complex, sometimes chaotic, structures where interacting particles exhibit long range correlations. Examples in everyday life include convection, turbulent flow, cyclones, hurricanes and living organisms. Less common examples include lasers, Bénard cells, droplet cluster, and the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction.

One way of mathematically modeling a dissipative system is given in the article on &quot;wandering sets&quot;: it involves the action of a group on a measurable set.

Dissipative systems can also be used as a tool to study economic systems and complex systems. For example, a dissipative system involving self-assembly of nanowires has been used as a model to understand the relationship between entropy generation and the robustness of biological systems.

The Hopf decomposition states that dynamical systems can be decomposed into a conservative and a dissipative part; more precisely, it states that every measure space with a non-singular transformation can be decomposed into an invariant conservative set and an invariant dissipative set.

== Dissipative structures in thermodynamics ==
Russian-Belgian physical chemist Ilya Prigogine, who coined the term &quot;dissipative structure,&quot; received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 for his pioneering work on these structures, which have dynamical regimes that can be regarded as thermodynamic steady states, and sometimes at least can be described by suitable extremal principles in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

In his Nobel lecture, Prigogine explains how thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium can have drastically different behavior from systems close to equilibrium. Near equilibrium, the &quot;local equilibrium&quot; hypothesis applies and typical thermodynamic quantities such as free energy and entropy can be defined locally. One can assume linear relations between the (generalized) flux and forces of the system. Two celebrated results from linear thermodynamics are the Onsager reciprocal relations and the principle of minimum entropy production. After efforts to extend such results to systems far from equilibrium, it was found that they do not hold in this regime and opposite results were obtained.

One way to rigorously analyze such systems is by studying the stability of the system far from equilibrium. Close to equilibrium, one can show the existence of a Lyapunov function which ensures that the entropy tends to a stable maximum. Fluctuations are damped in the neighborhood of the fixed point and a macroscopic description suffices. However, far from equilibrium stability is no longer a universal property and can be broken. In chemical systems, this occurs with the presence of autocatalytic reactions, such as in the example of the Brusselator. If the system is driven beyond a certain threshold, oscillations are no longer damped out, but may be amplified. Mathematically, this corresponds to a Hopf bifurcation where increasing one of the parameters beyond a certain value leads to limit cycle behavior. If spatial effects are taken into account through a reaction–diffusion equation, long-range correlations and spatially ordered patterns arise, such as in the case of the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. Systems with such dynamic states of matter that arise as the result of irreversible processes are dissipative structures.

Recent research has seen reconsideration of Prigogine&#x27;s ideas of dissipative structures in relation to biological systems.

== Dissipative systems in control theory ==
Willems first introduced the concept of dissipativity in systems theory to describe dynamical systems by input-output properties. Considering a dynamical system described by its state formula_1, its input formula_2 and its output formula_3, the input-output correlation is given a supply rate formula_4. A system is said to be dissipative with respect to a supply rate if there exists a continuously differentiable storage function formula_5 such that formula_6, formula_7 and

:formula_8.

As a special case of dissipativity, a system is said to be passive if the above dissipativity inequality holds with respect to the passivity supply rate formula_9.

The physical interpretation is that formula_10 is the energy stored in the system, whereas formula_11 is the energy that is supplied to the system.

This notion has a strong connection with Lyapunov stability, where the storage functions may play, under certain conditions of controllability and observability of the dynamical system, the role of Lyapunov functions.

Roughly speaking, dissipativity theory is useful for the design of feedback control laws for linear and nonlinear systems. Dissipative systems theory has been discussed by V.M. Popov, J.C. Willems, D.J. Hill, and P. Moylan. In the case of linear invariant systems, this is known as positive real transfer functions, and a fundamental tool is the so-called Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma which relates the state space and the frequency domain properties of positive real systems. Dissipative systems are still an active field of research in systems and control, due to their important applications.

== Quantum dissipative systems ==

As quantum mechanics, and any classical dynamical system, relies heavily on Hamiltonian mechanics for which time is reversible, these approximations are not intrinsically able to describe dissipative systems. It has been proposed that in principle, one can couple weakly the system – say, an oscillator – to a bath, i.e., an assembly of many oscillators in thermal equilibrium with a broad band spectrum, and trace (average) over the bath. This yields a master equation which is a special case of a more general setting called the Lindblad equation that is the quantum equivalent of the classical Liouville equation. The well-known form of this equation and its quantum counterpart takes time as a reversible variable over which to integrate, but the very foundations of dissipative structures imposes an irreversible and constructive role for time.

Recent research has seen the quantum extension of Jeremy England&#x27;s theory of dissipative adaptation (which generalizes Prigogine&#x27;s ideas of dissipative structures to far-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics, as stated above).

==Applications on dissipative systems of dissipative structure concept==

The framework of dissipative structures as a mechanism to understand the behavior of systems in constant interexchange of energy has been successfully applied on different science fields and applications, as in optics, population dynamics and growth and chemomechanical structures.
