<text>Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) is the fourth studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on November 11, 2000, by Nothing and Interscope Records. A rock opera concept album, it is the final installment of a triptych that also included &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; (1996), and marked a return to the industrial metal style of the band&#x27;s earlier work, after the glam rock-influenced production of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; (1998). After its release, the band&#x27;s eponymous vocalist said that the overarching story within the trilogy is presented in reverse chronological order: &quot;Holy Wood&quot;, therefore, begins the narrative.

In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, national news media reported that the perpetrators were wearing the band&#x27;s T-shirts during the rampage, and had been influenced by their music, both of which were untrue. As their first release after the massacre, the record was Manson&#x27;s rebuttal to the accusations leveled against him and the group, and was described by the vocalist as a &quot;declaration of war&quot;. It was written in the singer&#x27;s former home in the Hollywood Hills and recorded in several undisclosed locations, including Death Valley and Laurel Canyon. His ambitions for &quot;Holy Wood&quot; initially included an eponymous film exploring its backstory—a project which has since been abandoned and was modified into the as-yet-unreleased &quot;Holy Wood&quot; novel.

The album was released to generally positive reviews. Several writers praised it as the band&#x27;s finest work, and multiple publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2000. British rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; went on to include it on its list of the best albums of the decade. In the US, &quot;Holy Wood&quot; was not as commercially successful as the band&#x27;s preceding records, debuting at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, it became their most successful album internationally, debuting in the top twenty of numerous national charts. It was certified gold in several countries, including Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the UK.

Three singles were released from the record: &quot;Disposable Teens&quot;, &quot;The Fight Song&quot; and &quot;The Nobodies&quot;, and the band embarked on the worldwide Guns, God and Government Tour. In 2010, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; published a 10th-anniversary commemorative piece in which they called the album &quot;Manson&#x27;s finest hour ... A decade on, there has still not been as eloquent and savage a musical attack on the media and mainstream culture ... [It is] still scathingly relevant [and] a credit to a man who refused to sit and take it, but instead come out swinging.&quot;

==Background and development==
In the late 1990s, Marilyn Manson and his eponymous band established themselves as a household name, and as one of the most controversial rock acts in music history. Their albums &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; (1996) and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; (1998) were both critical and commercial successes, and by the time of their Rock Is Dead Tour in 1999, the frontman had become a culture war iconoclast and a rallying icon for alienated youth. As their popularity increased, the confrontational nature of the group&#x27;s music and imagery outraged social conservatives. Numerous politicians lobbied to have their performances banned, citing false and exaggerated claims that they contained animal sacrifices, bestiality and rape. Their concerts were routinely picketed by religious advocates and parent groups, who asserted that their music had a corrupting influence on youth culture by inciting &quot;rape, murder, blasphemy and suicide&quot;.

On April 20, 1999, Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot dead 12 students and a teacher and wounded 21 others, before committing suicide. In the aftermath of the school shooting, the band were widely reported to have influenced the killings; early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and were wearing the group&#x27;s T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson&#x27;s music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fans—and, on the contrary, had disliked the band&#x27;s music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.

Under mounting pressure in the days after Columbine, the group postponed their last five North American tour dates out of respect for the victims and their families. On April 29, ten US senators (led by Sam Brownback of Kansas) sent a letter to Edgar Bronfman Jr. – the president of Seagram (the owner of Interscope) – requesting a voluntary halt to his company&#x27;s distribution to children of &quot;music that glorifies violence&quot;. The letter named Marilyn Manson for producing songs which &quot;eerily reflect&quot; the actions of Harris and Klebold. Later that day, the band cancelled their remaining North American shows. Two days later, Manson published his response to these accusations in an op-ed piece for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, titled &quot;Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?&quot;, where he castigated America&#x27;s gun culture, the political influence of the National Rifle Association of America, and the media&#x27;s irresponsible coverage, which he said facilitated the placing of blame on a scapegoat, instead of debating more relevant societal issues.

On May 4, a hearing on the marketing and distribution of violent content to minors by the television, music, film and video-game industries was held by the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from former Secretary of Education (and co-founder of conservative violent entertainment watchdog group Empower America) William Bennett, the Archbishop of Denver Charles J. Chaput, professors and mental-health professionals. Speakers criticized the band, its label-mate Nine Inch Nails, and the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot; for their alleged contribution to a cultural environment enabling violence such as the Columbine shootings. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry&#x27;s marketing practices to minors.

After concluding the European and Japanese legs of their tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of &quot;Holy Wood&quot; coincided with Manson&#x27;s three-month seclusion at his home in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: &quot;There was a bit of trepidation, [in] deciding: &#x27;Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I&#x27;m trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?&#x27; Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face ... there were not a lot of people who stood behind me.&quot; He told &quot;Alternative Press&quot; that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he &quot;could be shot Mark David Chapman-style.&quot; He began work on the album as a counterattack.

==Recording and production==
Several of the tracks that appear on &quot;Holy Wood&quot; date back to 1995, prior to the release of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, although much of this material consisted of &quot;scattered ideas&quot;. Manson, the band&#x27;s vocalist, developed this material into more substantial compositions during his three-month period of seclusion. Following this, the full band worked for a year on re-writing and developing the material. The record is the group&#x27;s most collaborative effort to date; all members contributed to the songwriting process. Most of the compositional work was done by Manson alongside guitarists Twiggy Ramirez and John 5. The vocalist contrasted his songwriting sessions between the two, calling sessions with the latter &quot;very focused&quot;, saying that most of their compositions would be completed before being taken to the rest of the band for consideration. In contrast, his sessions with Ramirez were less demanding, and the pair frequently experimented with absinthe. Drummer Ginger Fish worked constantly on new material, and is credited with performing keyboards and programming, while keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy provided input on &quot;President Dead&quot; and &quot;Cruci-Fiction in Space&quot;. Altogether, the band wrote 100 musical fragments, of which between 25 and 30 became songs.
Band members maintained a low profile during the album&#x27;s recording. Manson indicated that their website would be their &quot;only contact with humanity&quot; during this period. The album was recorded at several locations, including Death Valley, Manson&#x27;s home in the Hollywood Hills, and Rick Rubin&#x27;s Mansion Studio in Laurel Canyon. Locations were chosen for the atmosphere they were intended to impart to the music, and the band visited Death Valley a number of times to &quot;imprint the feeling of the desert into [their] minds&quot;, and to avoid composing artificial-sounding songs. Manson co-produced the album alongside mixing engineer Dave Sardy, while Bon Harris of electronic body music group Nitzer Ebb is credited with programming and pre-production editing. Experimental sound effects and acoustic songs were recorded using live instrumentation. Harris&#x27; programming skills would prove invaluable during the recording process, as he would take the natural sounds the band had been recording and reconstruct them into processed background effects. Manson also explained that the acoustic songs were &quot;acoustic&quot; in the sense that they were not recorded with electronic instruments, but he said the album&#x27;s sonic landscape would be &quot;intrinsically electronic&quot;.

Manson announced on December 16, 1999, that the album was progressing under the working title &quot;In the Shadow of the Valley of Death&quot;, and that its logo would be the alchemical symbol for mercury. Expanding on the symbol&#x27;s relationship to the album&#x27;s concept, Manson said &quot;It represents both the androgyne and the prima materia, which has been associated with Adam, the first man.&quot; The band spent considerable time at the Mansion Studio, where the bulk of Ginger Fish&#x27;s live drumming would be recorded, with its cavernous rooms particularly suitable for recording percussion. On February 23, 2000, Manson delivered a 20-minute lecture via satellite to a current-events convention, &quot;DisinfoCon 2000&quot;, aimed at exposing disinformation wherein he posed the question, &quot;White teenagers, why are they mad? They&#x27;re white. They&#x27;re spoiled. Is it because they know that America&#x27;s a lie? ... Is adult entertainment killing our children? Or is killing our children entertaining adults?&quot; Six days later, it was announced that their upcoming album had been re-titled &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot;. By April, the album was in the final stages of recording, and Manson began posting footage of the band from the studio.

===Novel and film===

Manson&#x27;s ambitions for the project initially included an eponymous film exploring the album&#x27;s backstory. In July 1999, he had reportedly begun negotiating with New Line Cinema to produce and distribute the film and its soundtrack. At the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards in Dublin (where the band performed on November 11), he disclosed the film&#x27;s title and his production plans. Manson met Chilean avant-garde filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky at the event to discuss work on the film, although no final decision was made. By February 29, 2000, the deal fell through when Manson had reservations that New Line Cinema would take the film in a direction which would not have &quot;retained his artistic vision&quot;.

Abandoning his attempt to bring &quot;Holy Wood&quot; to the screen, Manson announced plans to publish two books accompanying the album. The first was a &quot;graphic and phantasmagoric&quot; novel intended for release shortly after the album by ReganBooks (a division of HarperCollins). The novel&#x27;s style was inspired by William S. Burroughs, Kurt Vonnegut, Aldous Huxley and Philip K. Dick, and would be followed by a coffee table book of images created for the project. In a December 2000 interview with Manson, novelist Chuck Palahniuk mentioned the &quot;Holy Wood&quot; novel (due for release in spring 2001) and complimented its style. Neither book has been released, reportedly due to a publishing dispute.

==Concept and themes==
Manson described &quot;Holy Wood&quot; as a &quot;declaration of war.&quot; The album&#x27;s plot is a parable, which he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was semi-autobiographical. While it can be viewed on several levels, he said its simplest interpretation is to see it as a story about an idealistic man whose revolution is commercialized, leading him to &quot;destroy the thing he has created, which is himself.&quot; It takes place in a thinly-veiled satire of modern America called &quot;Holy Wood&quot;, which Manson described as a Disney-esque city-sized amusement park where the main attractions are death and violence, and where consumerism is taken to hyperbolic extreme. Its literary foil is &quot;Death Valley&quot;, which is used as a &quot;metaphor for the outcast and the imperfect of the world.&quot;

The central character is the protagonist Adam Kadmon—a name derived from the Kabbalah which means &quot;original man&quot;. The story follows him as he goes in search of a better life out of Death Valley and into Holy Wood. Disenchanted by what he finds, he fashions a counterculture revolution, only to have it usurped and co-opted by Holy Wood&#x27;s consumer culture, and he finds himself appropriated as a figure of Holy Wood&#x27;s ideology of &quot;Celebritarianism&quot;: an ideology in which fame is the primary moral value of a religion deeply rooted in celebrity worship and martyrdom; where dead celebrities are revered as saints, and John F. Kennedy is idolized as the contemporary Jesus Christ. Holy Wood&#x27;s religion parallels Christianity, in that it juxtaposes the dead-celebrity phenomenon in American culture with the crucifixion of Jesus.
The phrase &quot;guns, god and government&quot; is repeated multiple times throughout the album. It is suggested that these are the root cause of violence, and the album examines the role conservative American culture played in the Columbine massacre: specifically, what Manson perceived as its advocacy of gun culture, the inadequacies and negative effects of traditional family values, the American inclination toward war-mongering solely for profit, and the Christian right&#x27;s proclivity for moral panic. This glorification of violence within mainstream American culture is the central theme of the record. A substantive portion of the record analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson&#x27;s view that the image of his crucifixion was the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the Bible&#x27;s content, for the purpose of &quot;Holy Wood&quot;, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain in the name of free market capitalism.

Christ&#x27;s death is also compared to Abraham Zapruder&#x27;s film of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which Manson called &quot;the only thing that&#x27;s happened in modern times to equal the crucifixion.&quot; He watched the clip many times as a child, and said it was the most violent thing he had ever seen. John Lennon is also referred to on the album as an assassinated icon murdered by a born-again Christian, Mark David Chapman, who was incensed by Lennon&#x27;s &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot; remark. While recording &quot;Holy Wood&quot;, Manson was drawn to The Beatles&#x27; 1968 &quot;White Album&quot;, due to its alleged role in inspiring the Charles Manson &quot;Family&quot; murders, and the parallels he observed between that incident and Columbine, saying: &quot;To my knowledge, it&#x27;s the first rock n&#x27; roll record that&#x27;s been blamed and linked to violence. When you&#x27;ve got &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; [taken from the Beatles song of the same name] written in blood on someone&#x27;s wall, it&#x27;s a little more damning than anything I&#x27;ve been blamed for.&quot;

==Composition and style==

The record is primarily an industrial rock and industrial metal album. Manson claimed in a pre-release interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; that the album would contain some of the heaviest material the band had recorded to date. &quot;Holy Wood&quot; combines the glam rock-influenced production of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; with the industrial rock soundscape of the band&#x27;s earlier work. He also called the record &quot;arrogant, in an art rock sense&quot; and said that, as a result of the lyrical content, most of the songs contained three or four distinct parts, although the band took great care to avoid being &quot;self-indulgent&quot;. He also said that the record was intended to be the &quot;industrial &quot;White Album&quot;&quot;, and that he wrote &quot;Holy Wood&quot; in the same house where The Rolling Stones wrote their 1970 single &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;—another source of inspiration.

Like &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; before it, &quot;Holy Wood&quot; uses a song cycle structure, dividing the album into four movements. These movements are titled A: In the Shadow, D: The Androgyne, A: Of Red Earth, and M: The Fallen. Manson described the record as &quot;the final piece of a triptych that I began with &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;.&quot; Despite being the last of the three albums to be released, Manson explained that the triptych&#x27;s storyline takes place in reverse chronological order; &quot;Holy Wood&quot; began the story, and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; and &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; were sequels. The storyline unfolds in a multi-tiered series of metaphors and allusions; for example, the album&#x27;s title refers not only to the Hollywood Sign, but also to &quot;the tree of knowledge that Adam took the first fruit from when he fell out of paradise, the wood that Christ was crucified on, the wood that [Lee Harvey] Oswald&#x27;s rifle is made from, and the wood that so many coffins are made of.&quot;

===A: In the Shadow===

&quot;GodEatGod&quot; is the first song on the record. It opens with the sound of a focal-plane shutter in slow-motion capturing gunshots ringing in the background amid screaming onlookers before transitioning into the song. The song is driven by keyboards, synthesizers and a synth bass. &quot;The Love Song&quot; was described by Manson as about &quot;America&#x27;s romance with guns&quot;, and its title originated from his observation that &quot;Love Song&quot; is one of the most common titles in music. The lyrics are composed around an elaborate metaphor about guns. Manson explained: &quot;I was suggesting with the lyrics that the father is the hand, the mother is the gun, and the children are the bullets. Where you shoot them is your responsibility as parents.&quot; The chorus is a rhetorical take on a popular American bumper sticker: &quot;Do you love your God, gun, government?&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described &quot;The Fight Song&quot; as a &quot;playground punk anthem&quot;, and Manson revealed that its theme is Adam&#x27;s desire to be a part of Holy Wood, saying that it is about &quot;a person who&#x27;s grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, but when he finally [gets there], he realizes that it&#x27;s worse than where he came from.&quot; &quot;Disposable Teens&quot; is a &quot;signature Marilyn Manson song&quot; with a bouncing guitar riff composed of staccato articulation. Its lyrics juxtapose the disenfranchisement of contemporary millennial youth with the revolutionary idealism of their baby boomer parents&#x27; generation. The Beatles&#x27; influence is evident in this song; the chorus echoes the disillusionment of the &quot;White Album&quot; &quot;Revolution 1&quot;.

===D: The Androgyne===
Manson singled out &quot;Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis)&quot; as his favorite song on the album and said that it describes every person&#x27;s desire for self-actualization. The song features an optigan and is propelled by flanged arpeggiated chords, building into heavy guitar chugs and string bending during the chorus. Drowned In Sound described the song as &quot;a shining moment&quot; on the record. &quot;President Dead&quot; is a guitar-driven song showcasing John 5&#x27;s technical skills and writing credits from John 5, Twiggy Ramirez, and Madonna Wayne Gacy. Manson also plays a mellotron. It opens with a sample of Don Gardiner&#x27;s &quot;ABC News Radio&quot; broadcast announcing the death of John F. Kennedy. The song is 3:13 long, which is a deliberate numerological reference to frame 313 of the Zapruder film—the frame displaying the moment of impact of the fatal head shot which killed Kennedy. &quot;In the Shadow of the Valley of Death&quot; is an introspective song with Adam at his most emotionally vulnerable. The song is divided into two parts. The first portion consists of samples and a &#x27;death loop&#x27; over a simple strum from John 5&#x27;s 1952 Gibson acoustic guitar that make way for a bass guitar and drums over plucked chords in the second portion. &quot;Cruci-Fiction in Space&quot; further explores American gun culture, postulating that Americans took an alternate evolutionary path; from monkeys to men to firearms. Its composition is slow but heavy—bereft of &quot;speed or intricacy.&quot; It has a mixed meter drum beat middle 8 in 4/4 time with two additional eighth notes at the end; &quot;it doesn&#x27;t start in 4/4, it doesn&#x27;t end in 4/4, so it&#x27;s confusing.&quot; &quot;A Place in the Dirt&quot; is another personal song, characterized by Adam&#x27;s self-analysis of his place in Holy Wood.

===A: Of Red Earth===

&quot;The Nobodies&quot; is a mournful, elegiac dirge constructed over an electric harpsichord and synthesized-drums. Its title is taken from a quote by Mark David Chapman. The verse &quot;Today I am dirty and I want to be pretty, tomorrow I&#x27;ll know that I&#x27;m just dirt&quot; has an Iggy Pop-style vocal delivery, building to the &quot;adrenaline-fueled&quot; chorus. &quot;CMJ&quot; noted that the song could be interpreted as a tribute to the Columbine shooters, but its point was not to glorify violence; rather, it was to depict a society drenched in its children&#x27;s blood. &quot;The Death Song&quot; is the turning point for Adam; he no longer cares. Manson described it as sarcastic and nihilistic: &quot;it&#x27;s like &#x27;We have no future and we don&#x27;t give a fuck&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described it as one of the album&#x27;s heaviest songs. The bridge of &quot;Lamb of God&quot; paraphrases the chorus of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (from 1970&#x27;s &quot;Let It Be&quot;), whose lyric &quot;Nothing&#x27;s gonna change my world&quot; inspired the song. Manson elaborated that: &quot;Mark David Chapman came along and proved him very wrong. That was always something growing up that was very sad and tragic to me&quot;. The song uses the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and John Lennon to criticize the media&#x27;s veneration of death, and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle. It is keyboard-heavy and feature a variety of instrumentation ranging from a piano, a minipiano, a leslie speaker, and multiple synthesizers. Unusual recording techniques were employed for its rhythm and acoustic guitar parts. &quot;Born Again&quot; is the second song on the record to use the synth bass and is the only other song, apart from &quot;The Nobodies&quot;, to use the drum machine. The song&#x27;s guitar tracks were led by Ramirez and supplemented by contributions from John 5. &quot;Burning Flag&quot; is a pounding heavy-metal song reminiscent of American industrial metal band Ministry.

===M: The Fallen===
Ramirez and John 5 collaborated on the guitar compositions for &quot;Coma Black&quot;; the song alternates between Ramirez&#x27;s &quot;warped guitar&quot; and the phaze guitar employed by John 5, with Manson providing additional rhythm guitar support. The album ends with an interlocking group of songs: &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;The Fall of Adam&quot;, &quot;King Kill 33°&quot; and &quot;Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)&quot; each end abruptly before being instantaneously followed by the introduction of the proceeding track. &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; was composed by Ramirez and Manson and feature Gacy playing the mellotron—the second time the eccentric instrument appears on the record. John 5 recorded guitar parts for &quot;The Fall of Adam&quot; in the pouring rain in an effort to extract a unique sound and deliberately mistuned his Gibson for the song&#x27;s intro to &quot;produce a sweeter sound.&quot; Bon Harris contributed the piano work for the final song &quot;Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)&quot; while Gacy exchanged his mellotron for this track in favor of a string synthesizer. It concludes on a cliffhanger; it ends with the sound of a solitary bullet being loaded into a revolver against a background of distant fireworks followed by the chamber being spun repeatedly. Its hammer is cocked six times, although its trigger is pulled only five times. The result of the sixth and final chamber is left for the listener to determine.

==Release and artwork==
Manson posted a four-minute video clip on the band&#x27;s website on December 16, 1999, featuring clips of two previously unreleased songs. The first clip was of a rock song which later became &quot;Disposable Teens&quot;, while the second was a rough demo of a cover of Frankie Laine and Jimmy Boyd&#x27;s 1953 single &quot;The Little Boy and the Old Man&quot; (composed by Wayne Shanklin a year earlier as &quot;Little Child&quot;; it was most popularly performed under the title &quot;Mommy Dear&quot; in the 1964 movie &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot;). As a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for fans, Manson posted a download of the band&#x27;s cover of Charles Manson&#x27;s &quot;Sick City&quot;, from his 1970 album &quot;&quot;. In August, he announced an October 24 release date for the record, and posted a partial track listing containing 13 song titles, while also indicating that their website would be updated weekly. Within three weeks, the album&#x27;s full track listing had been revealed, and sound files of &quot;Burning Flag&quot;, &quot;Cruci-Fiction in Space&quot; and &quot;The Love Song&quot; had been released for free download, along with the cover of the &quot;Holy Wood&quot; novel.

On September 18, Manson announced that the album&#x27;s US release would be postponed until November 14 (to fine-tune the final mix), and that its first single would be &quot;Disposable Teens&quot;. The album was released on three formats on November 13 in the UK by Nothing and Interscope Records. Versions of the enhanced CD edition released in the UK featured an acoustic version of &quot;The Nobodies&quot; as a bonus track, while Japanese editions also included a live version of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;. The album was released on double-LP and cassette. Universal Music Japan released a remastered version of the album on Super High Material CD (SHM-CD) on March 23, 2013.
Artwork for the album was designed by Manson and P. R. Brown. Manson began conceptualizing it as he wrote the songs, and Brown and Manson worked in tandem to realize the imagery after deciding to do the work themselves. The cover art, which portrays Manson as a crucified Christ with his jawbone torn off, is intended as a criticism of censorship and America&#x27;s obsession with martyrs. It is a cropped reinterpretation of The Hanged Man Tarot card. Underneath is an obscured portion of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s coroner report, displaying the words &quot;clinical record&quot; and &quot;autopsy&quot;. The typeface used on the band&#x27;s name is the same font used on the Disney World logo in the 1960s.

The cover was controversial; editions of the album sold at Circuit City came housed in a cardboard sleeve featuring an alternative cover, while Walmart and Kmart refused to stock the album at all. A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee threatened to go on a hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves. Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: &quot;The irony is that my point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship. This doesn&#x27;t piss me off as much as it pleases me, because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point.&quot; In 2008, Gigwise ranked it at number ten on their list of &quot;The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers of All Time&quot;.

A set of fourteen redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, based on the Rider–Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album&#x27;s artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album&#x27;s lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, is sitting in a wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album&#x27;s inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.

==Promotion and singles==
Three singles were released to promote the album, with &quot;Disposable Teens&quot; being released as its lead single. The band made their debut appearance on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to perform the song. Its music video was directed by Samuel Bayer, which debuted on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on October 25. The single was released in the UK on November 6, and featured several B-sides, including covers of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; and The Doors&#x27; &quot;Five to One&quot;, as well as original tracks &quot;Diamonds &amp; Pollen&quot; and &quot;Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes&quot;. The latter had been released the previous year on the soundtrack to &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;. The band performed &quot;Disposable Teens&quot; on the &quot;MTV New Year&#x27;s&quot; Eve celebration in 2000, along with a cover of Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;Surrender&quot;. It was also performed at the 2001 &quot;American Music Awards&quot;.

From November 1, the UK division of Interscope held a contest to promote the album. The contest invited fans to log onto the band&#x27;s website daily to pick up a series of coded clues which led to a hidden message. Fans who solved the riddle received an exclusive download, and were entered into a drawing for a one-week trip for two to meet the band in Hollywood. On November 14, the band took a break from the Guns, God and Government Tour to celebrate the album&#x27;s US release date with a brief, invitation-only acoustic set at the Saci nightclub in New York City. Tickets for the show were given out via their website, in radio contests, and to the first 100 album buyers at Tower Records on Broadway in New York. The set consisted of four songs, including their cover &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot; – the theme of the film (and TV series) &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; – which they had recently contributed to the soundtrack of &quot;Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2&quot;. The following day, the vocalist appeared on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; in a segment entitled &quot;Mothers Against Marilyn Manson&quot;.

&quot;The Fight Song&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on February 19, 2001, in the UK. A remix of the song by Joey Jordison of Slipknot appeared as its B-side. Its music video was directed by Manson and W.I.Z. and sparked controversy for its violent depiction of an American football game between jocks and goths, with &quot;NME&quot; accusing it of being exploitative of the Columbine tragedy. Manson dismissed the claims as hype, and said: &quot;I&#x27;m trying to show that sports as well as music can be seen as violent, so I chose a traditional black vs white, good vs evil theme for the video.&quot; Manson appeared on an April 2001 episode of &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, where he once again denied that the band&#x27;s music was responsible for Columbine. Bill O&#x27;Reilly argued that &quot;disturbed kids&quot; without direction from responsible parents could misinterpret the message of his music as endorsing the belief that &quot;when I&#x27;m dead [then] everybody&#x27;s going to know me.&quot; Manson responded:

In mid-2001, Universal Music Group was criticized for airing commercials promoting the album during episodes of &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. Manson suspected that former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman played a role in the criticism. Lieberman and Hillary Clinton had recently introduced the Media Marketing Accountability Act of 2001 before the 107th United States Congress. This legislation proposed to ban the entertainment-industry from marketing suspected violent or explicit material to minors.

Manson announced prior to the release of &quot;The Fight Song&quot; that &quot;The Nobodies&quot; would be issued as the album&#x27;s third single, whilst indicating a desire to film its video in Russia because &quot;the atmosphere, the desolation, the coldness and the architecture would really suit the song.&quot; Another early plan was to incorporate the MTV series &quot;Jackass&quot;, as the song was included in the show&#x27;s soundtrack. The idea was later abandoned, however, when the show drew the ire of Lieberman. The music video was directed by Paul Fedor and premiered on MTV in June, and the single was released in the UK on September 3. Its release was timed to coincide with the band&#x27;s appearance at the Reading Festival, and was accompanied by another competition on the band&#x27;s website—the winner was awarded two full-weekend passes to the festival, as well as unrestricted backstage access and a private sleeping area. A remix of the song later appeared in the 2001 Johnny Depp film &quot;From Hell&quot;.

===Tour===

The album was promoted by the worldwide Guns, God and Government Tour, which began in North America in 3–6,000-capacity venues on October 27, 2000, at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis. Typically for the band, the concerts were highly theatrical. The tour&#x27;s imagery was mainly derived from the concept and themes found on the album; its logo was a rifle, with handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross. Sets were designed with communist, religious and &quot;celebritarian&quot; imagery. Manson had a number of costume changes during each show: a bishop&#x27;s dalmatic and mitre (often confused with papal regalia); a costume made from animals (including epaulettes made from a horse&#x27;s tail and a shirt made from skinned goat heads and ostrich spines); his signature black leather corset, g-string and garter stockings; an elaborate Roman legionary-style imperial galea; an Allgemeine SS-style peaked police cap; a black-and-white fur coat, and a large conical skirt which lifted him in the air.

The Ozzfest leg of the tour marked the band&#x27;s first performance in Denver, Colorado (on June 22, 2001, at Mile High Stadium) after the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton. After initially canceling due to a scheduling conflict, the band changed their plans to play the Denver date. The group&#x27;s decision met resistance from conservative groups; Manson received death threats and demands to cancel the band&#x27;s performance. A group of church leaders, businesses and families related to Columbine formed an ad hoc organization opposing the show. Citizens for Peace and Respect, which was supported by Colorado governor Bill Owens and representative Tom Tancredo, claimed on their website that the band &quot;promotes hate, violence, death, suicide, drug use, and the attitudes and actions of the Columbine killers&quot;. In response, Manson issued a statement:

Two films of the concert tour were made. The &quot;Guns, God and Government&quot; DVD was released on October 29, 2002, by Eagle Rock Entertainment, and featured live footage taken from several different performances in Los Angeles, Russia, Japan, and throughout Europe. It also included a 30-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, &quot;The Death Parade&quot;, with guest appearances from Ozzy Osbourne and Eminem. This was followed seven years later by a Blu-ray titled &quot;Guns, God and Government – Live in L.A.&quot; Released by Eagle Rock on November 17, 2009, it depicts the band&#x27;s entire sixteen-song set from their January 13, 2001, performance at the Grand Olympic Auditorium—the final headlining show of the North American leg of the tour.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Holy Wood&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics at the time of its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 14 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, and is the 88th best-reviewed album of the year. The record was praised by several publications as being the band&#x27;s finest work: Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as their definitive record; a writer for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it their &quot;most potent effort yet&quot;, and April Long of &quot;NME&quot; said it was &quot;by far the best thing Manson has ever set his warped mind to, [it] ultimately inspires something far more potent than fear or hatred—respect.&quot;

The band received acclaim for the quality of their songwriting. Daniel Durchholz of Wall of Sound called &quot;Holy Wood&quot; their most ambitious and musically accomplished record to date. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; said that &quot;almost all [of the songs] contain a double-take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind-blowing bridge, and they&#x27;ll be terroristic in concert.&quot; &quot;Hot Press&quot; praised the band for their inventive musical arrangements, and said that &quot;&quot;Holy Wood&quot; is a far better record than many would have dared to expect.&quot; Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band&#x27;s performance, saying that they &quot;play tighter than [ever] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of a team effort) ... and, musically, it has a lot more variation and scope than the Limp Bizkits of the world.&quot; The band&#x27;s vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commended him for &quot;addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. &quot;Revolver&quot; editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon&#x27;s, writing: &quot;What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson&#x27;s lyrics. Like &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;, &quot;Holy Wood&quot; screams with a primal fury that&#x27;s evident even in its quietest moments.&quot;

The album also received some mixed reviews. Several publications criticized its length, as well as the band for abandoning the glam rock-influenced production of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;. PopMatters argued that the album was too long, and claimed it would have been a more consistent record if subject matter was addressed literally, instead of through a &#x27;concept album&#x27; format. Joshua Klein of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; rated &quot;Holy Wood&quot; a B−, but was overall critical of the lack of glam rock-influenced songs on the album. Robert Hilburn, in a review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was also disappointed that the album did not live up to &quot;the promise of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;&quot;. He viewed the musical cross-pollination of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; as confusion on the band&#x27;s part as to which of the two albums appealed most to casual listeners.

===Accolades===
The album appeared in numerous publication&#x27;s lists of best albums of 2000. It appeared at number nine on &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s list of albums of the year, and went on to rate it the 11th best album of the 2000–2009 decade, while &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 34 in their critic&#x27;s pick of the 50 best albums of 2000 in their &quot;Decade in Music&quot; series. German magazine &quot;Musik Express/Sounds&quot; listed the album at number 30 in their critics&#x27; top 50, and at number nine in the popular poll of their &quot;Albums of 2000&quot; list. The French edition of British magazine &quot;Rock Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Holy Wood&quot; 15th in their &quot;Le choix de la rédaction&quot; (editors choice) and 5th in &quot;Le choix des lecteurs&quot; (readers choice) of their 2000 &quot;Albums de l&#x27;année&quot; (albums of the year). &quot;Record Collector&quot; also included it on their &quot;Best of 2000&quot; list. It went on to win the &quot;Best Album&quot; accolade at the 2001 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards.

Retrospective commentary on the album has been highly positive. In November 2010, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; published a tenth-anniversary commemorative issue dedicated to &quot;Holy Wood&quot; titled &quot;Screaming For Vengeance&quot;, calling it &quot;Manson&#x27;s finest hour&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; identified the album as a modern classic, calling it the band&#x27;s &quot;creative zenith&quot;; later, in 2020, the magazine named it one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000. Manson said in a June 2015 Reddit AMA that he considered the record to be his best work, and, that same month, &quot;NME&quot; referred to it as the band&#x27;s best album. A 2016 feature in &quot;Houston Press&quot; called &quot;Holy Wood&quot; &quot;the album that really cemented the band as more than just shock-rockers, but true musical mavericks with an intelligent perspective on social issues.&quot; &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; referred to the record as &quot;perfect&quot;, saying: &quot;Manson has yet to better &quot;Holy Wood&quot; and that&#x27;s fine—nobody&#x27;s really bettered it. The flow of the record, the delivery of its concept, the clarity with which it strikes its opponents. A gargantuan artistic feat that will go down in history as Manson&#x27;s defining statement.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
Prior to the record&#x27;s release, several critics and retailers openly questioned whether the band still had significant commercial appeal with mainstream consumers, with rap rock emerging as the predominant rock genre of the early 2000s. Furthermore, according to &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, &quot;By the turn of the century, Manson was no longer America&#x27;s demon dog. White trash superstar Eminem had clocked his position and supplanted him.&quot; A clean version of the album was never manufactured. This resulted in &quot;Holy Wood&quot; being banned from sale at major retailers such as Walmart and Kmart, who enforce a strict policy on not stocking albums labeled with a Parental Advisory sticker. Best Buy&#x27;s sales projections estimated its first-week sales at about 150,000 units nationally, significantly less than the 223,000 copies sold by &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; during its first week.

&quot;Holy Wood&quot; debuted and peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 117,279—an initial commercial disappointment. It spent 13 consecutive weeks on the chart before dropping off – far short of the 52 and 33 weeks &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; and &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; spent on the chart, respectively – making it the shortest-charting full-length LP by the band until &quot;The High End of Low&quot; (2009). It took over two years to be certified gold by the RIAA (in March 2003), denoting shipments in excess of 500,000 units. The album sold over 573,000 copies in the US by 2010, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Manson attributed its lack of commercial appeal to the musical climate of the time, and argued that, at the height of the band&#x27;s popularity, their US album sales peaked between one and two million units, so &quot;it&#x27;s not such a disaster as if we were coming down from seven or eight million records.&quot; He also said that the drop in US sales was off-set by increasing international success.

The record reached the top 20 of numerous international markets, including Canada, where it peaked at number 13 and was certified gold by the CRIA for shipments of over 50,000 units. The record was more successful in continental Europe than preceding albums, peaking at number nine on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Eurochart. It entered the top 10 of the national charts in Austria, Italy, and Sweden, and the top 20 in a further six countries: France, Norway, Poland, and Spain. It debuted at number 11 on the German Albums Chart and spent over five months on the chart—their second-longest chart run there, behind &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; (2003). It also reached the top 20 in Switzerland, where it was certified gold by the IFPI almost five years after its release for shipments in excess of 25,000 units. Similarly, despite peaking at number 23 and spending just four weeks on the UK Albums Chart, it would be certified gold by the BPI in July 2013 for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.

In Australasia, &quot;Holy Wood&quot; peaked at number eight on the Australian Albums Chart, and reached the top twenty in New Zealand, peaking at number 18. The album also peaked at number 13 on the Japanese Oricon chart, where it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for shipments of over 100,000 units.

<text>In agriculture, rotational grazing, as opposed to continuous grazing, describes many systems of pasturing, whereby livestock are moved to portions of the pasture, called paddocks, while the other portions rest. Each paddock must provide all the needs of the livestock, such as food, water and sometimes shade and shelter. The approach often produces lower outputs than more intensive animal farming operations, but requires lower inputs, and therefore sometimes produces higher net farm income per animal.

==Approach==
In rotational grazing livestock are moved to portions of the pasture, called paddocks, while the other portions rest. The intent is to allow the pasture plants and soil time to recover.

Healing native rangeland may require a combination of burning and rotational grazing.

Rotational grazing can be used with ruminants such as cattle, sheep or goats; non-ruminants such as pigs can also be used. The herds graze one portion of pasture, or a paddock, while allowing the others to recover. The length of time a paddock is grazed will depend on the size of the herd and the size of the paddock and local environmental factors. Resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to regrow. Rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers do better on the more tender younger plant stems. These systems may or may not leave parasites behind to die off, minimizing or eliminating the need for de-wormers, depending if the rotational time is smaller or larger than the parasitic life cycle.

==Benefits==
Herd health benefits arise from animals having access to both space and fresh air. Freedom of movement within a paddock results in increased physical fitness, which limits the potential for injuries and abrasion, and sometimes depending on the system reduces the potential of exposure to high levels of harmful disease-causing microorganisms and insects.

In a concentrated animal feeding operation it is normal for a large number of animals to continuously occupy a small area. By comparison, with managed grazing, the animals are able to live in a more natural environment. The animals experience less disease and fewer foot ailments, depending on the rotational system being used.

Managed rotational grazing is a key component of a regenerative agriculture system, as it functions as a constant feedback loop. Rotational grazing has been said to be more environmentally friendly in certain cases. Many pastures undergoing certain types of rotational grazing are less susceptible to soil erosion. Paddocks might require fewer inputs. These grazing regimes are sometimes said to be more resilient and more capable of responding to changing environmental conditions. Rotational grazing may reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, and methane. One study looking at finishing stages suggested that adaptive multi-paddock grazing could result in a net carbon sink. However, the study&#x27;s authors have cautioned that the results are limited in scope as they are only looking at one stage of an experimental system. Other studies have also found some land may sequester just as much or more without any grazing.

==Problems==
A key element of this style of animal husbandry is that either each grazed area must contain all elements needed for the animals (water source, for instance) or the feed or water source must be moved each time the animals are moved. Having fixed feeding or watering stations can defeat the rotational aspect, leading to degradation of the ground around the water supply or feed supply if additional feed is provided to the animals. Special care must be taken to ensure that high use areas do not become areas where mud, parasites or diseases are spread or communicated.

Several problems are related to shade in pasture areas. Although shade provides relief from heat and reduces the risk of heat stress, animals tend to congregate in these areas which leads to nutrient loading, uneven grazing, and potential soil erosion.

Ruminal tympany, also known as bloat, is a common serious problem when ruminants graze on fresh, young pasture, and if left untreated can be fatal. This problem occurs when foam producing compounds in plants are digested by cows, causing foam to form in the rumen of the animal and not allowing animals to properly belch gas. Animals are especially susceptible to bloat if they are moved to new pasture sources when they are particularly hungry and especially on young, fresh and wet legumes. It is therefore important to ensure that the herd is eating enough at the end of a rotation when forage will be more scarce, limiting the potential for animals to gorge themselves when turned out onto new paddocks. The risk of bloat can be mitigated by careful management of rotations, seeding the non-bloating European legume species &quot;Lotus corniculatus&quot; in pasturelands, reducing the amount of legumes/increasing grasses, providing sufficient supplemental feeding and extra fodder when turning out on new paddocks, reducing the size of the paddock when livestock is first turned out, and daily rations of the anti-foaming agent poloxalene mixed well into the fodder.

==Weed control==
A well managed rotational grazing system has low pasture weed establishment because the majority of niches are already filled with established forage species, making it harder for weeds to compete and become established. The use of multiple species in the pasture helps to minimize weeds. Established forage plants in rotational grazing pasture systems are healthy and unstressed due to the &quot;rest&quot; period, enhancing the competitive advantage of the forage. Additionally, in comparison to grain crop production, many plants which would be considered weeds are not problematic in perennial pasture. However, certain species such as thistles and various other weeds, are indigestible or poisonous to grazers. These plant species will not be grazed by the herd and can be recognized for their prevalence in pasture systems.

A key step in managing weeds in any pasture system is identification. Once the undesired species in a pasture system are identified, an integrated approach of management can be implemented to control weed populations. No single approach to weed management will result in weed free pastures; therefore, various cultural, mechanical, and chemical control methods can be combined in a weed management plan. Cultural controls include: avoiding spreading manure contaminated with weed seeds, cleaning equipment after working in weed infested areas, and managing weed problems in fencerows and other areas near pastures. Mechanical controls such as repeated mowing, clipping, and hand weeding can also be used to effectively manage weed infestations by weakening the plant. These methods should be implemented when weed flower buds are closed or just starting to open to prevent seed production. Although these first two methods reduce need for herbicides, weed problems may still persist in managed grazing systems and the use of herbicides may become necessary. Use of herbicides may restrict the use of a pasture for some length of time, depending on the type and amount of the chemical used. Frequently, weeds in pasture systems are patchy and therefore spot treatment of herbicides may be used as a least cost method of chemical control.

==Nutrient availability and soil fertility==

If pasture systems are seeded with more than 40% legumes, commercial nitrogen fertilization is unnecessary for adequate plant growth. Legumes are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, thus providing nitrogen for themselves and surrounding plants.

Although grazers remove nutrient sources from the pasture system when they feed on forage sources, the majority of the nutrients consumed by the herd are returned to the pasture system through manure. At a relatively high stocking rate, or high ratio of animals per hectare, manure will be evenly distributed across the pasture system. The nutrient content in these manure sources should be adequate to meet plant requirements, making commercial fertilization unnecessary. Rotational grazing systems are often associated with increased soil fertility which arises because manure is a rich source of organic matter that increases the health of soil. In addition, these pasture system are less susceptible to erosion because the land base has continuous ground cover throughout the year.

High levels of fertilizers entering waterways are a pertinent environmental concern associated with agricultural systems. However, rotational grazing systems effectively reduce the amount of nutrients that move off-farm which have the potential to cause environmental degradation. These systems are fertilized with on-farm sources, and are less prone to leaching as compared to commercial fertilizers. Additionally, the system is less prone to excess nutrient fertilization, so the majority of nutrients put into the system by manure sources are utilized for plant growth. Permanent pasture systems also have deeper, better established forage root systems which are more efficient at taking up nutrients from within the soil profile.

==Economics==
Although milk yields are often lower in rotational systems, net farm income per cow is often greater as compared to confinement operations. This is due to the additional costs associated with herd health and purchased feeds are greatly reduced in management intensive rotational grazing systems. Additionally, a transition to rotational grazing is associated with low start-up and maintenance costs. Another consideration is that while production per cow is less, the number of cows per acre on the pasture can increase. The net effect is more productivity per acre at less cost.

The main costs associated with transitioning rotational grazing are purchasing fencing, fencers, and water supply materials. If a pasture was continuously grazed in the past, likely capital has already been invested in fencing and a fencer system. Cost savings to graziers can also be recognized when one considers that many of the costs associated with livestock operations are transmitted to the grazers. For example, the grazers actively harvest their own sources of food for the portion of the year where grazing is possible. This translates into lower costs for feed production and harvesting, which are fuel intensive endeavors. Rotational grazing systems rely on the grazers to produce fertilizer sources via their excretion. There is also no need for collection, storage, transportation, and application of manure, which are also all fuel intensive. Additionally, external fertilizer use contributes to other costs such as labor, purchasing costs.

Rotational grazing results in time savings because the majority of work which might otherwise require human labor is transmitted to the herd.

== Criticism ==

Managers have found that rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, but scientific experiments have demonstrated that some rotational grazing systems do not always necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. This controversy stems from two main categorical differences in rotational grazing, prescribed management and adaptive management. The performance of rangeland grazing strategies are similarly constrained by several ecological variables establishing that differences among them are dependent on the effectiveness of those management models. Depending on the management model, plant production has been shown to be equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 87% of the experiments.

== Incentives ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, incentives for managed rotational grazing operations are found throughout the Farm Bill, an omnibus package of federal legislation passed roughly once every five years. Within this package, conservation programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) focus on providing financial and technical support to working lands, such as ranches. 

Managed rotational grazing is included as an eligible conservation practice for funding under EQIP. Applicants must have a certified grazing plan in place, written and approved by certified grazing planners. The most common grazing practices under this program are grazing management design and identification of necessary materials, prescribed grazing that includes animal rotation and pasture resting, and mechanical treatment to improve soil and plant conditions. 

In contrast, CSP is intended to provide &quot;whole-farm&quot; financial and technical assistance to farmers who combine basic conservation activities with more substantial interventions. Grazing enhancements eligible for CSP funding include:

* Management Intensive Rotational Grazing 
* Installing electrical fence offsets and wire to facilitate cross-fencing for improved grazing management 
* Grazing management that improves or maintains watersheds, pollinator habitat, or wildlife 
* Prescribed grazing that protects sensitive areas from gully erosion as well as surface or ground water from nutrients 
* Strategically planned patch burning for grazing distribution and wildlife habitat 
* Grazing to reduce wildfire risks in forests 
* Improved grazing management on pasture for plant productivity and health with monitoring activities 
* Maintaining forage quality and quantity for animal health and productivity

Other Farm Bill programs that may impact grazing incentives: 

* Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
* Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP)
* Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative (GLCI)

<text>Ray Wade Harroun (January 12, 1879 – January 19, 1968) was an American racing driver and pioneering race car constructor. He is most famous for winning the inaugural Indianapolis 500 in 1911.

== Biography ==

Harroun was born on January 12, 1879, in Spartansburg, Pennsylvania to Russell LaFayette Harroun and Lucy A. Halliday. His father was a carpenter. Ray was their youngest child.

Harroun served on a U.S. Navy coaler during the Spanish American War.

He participated in the original setting of the land speed record driving from Chicago to New York in 1903, and the re-taking of that record in 1904. He and four others drove in shifts non-stop to establish the record of 76 hours at the end of September, 1903. That time was bested by another team nearly a year later, and in October 1904, the Columbia team re-set the record at 58 hrs, 35 min. That record stood for nearly two years. Other drivers in both years included Bert Holcomb (who was in charge of the runs), Lawrence Duffie (Demonstrator of the Gasoline Dept of Electric Vehicle Company, which manufactured Columbia cars), and Harry Sandol. In 1903, the fifth driver was David R. Adams; in 1904 it was Eddie Bald.

=== Racing career ===

Nicknamed the &quot;Little Professor&quot; for his pioneering work of creating, with Howard Marmon, the Marmon Wasp, which was a revolutionary design being the first open-wheel single-seater racecar. Harroun is best known for winning the first running of the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race on May 30, 1911. He is known to have started at least 60 AAA-sanctioned races, during the years 1905–1911 (statistics on some of the shorter races document only the top three finishers, so some starts resulting in lower finishes may not be known), winning 19. From 1909 to 1911, Harroun drove primarily for the team operated by Indianapolis-based auto maker, Marmon. However, at least one 1909 race result shows him driving a Buick. Also, statistics from 1905 through 1908 show him driving cars described as &quot;Harroun Custom&quot; and &quot;Harroun Sneezer.&quot;

=== Race wins ===

Harroun&#x27;s race wins included: a 1910 100-mile race at the Atlanta Motordrome; the 1910 200-mile Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race (at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway); the May 1910, 50-mile Remy Grand Brassard Race (also at IMS); three races at Churchill Downs (home of the Kentucky Derby); three races at the original Latonia Race Track; and races at tracks in New Orleans, Los Angeles, Long Island and Memphis. He is best known for winning the first Indianapolis 500, driving a Marmon.

Harroun won a total of 8 races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the second-most of any driver in the 100-year history of the track (the only driver with more victories at IMS is Johnny Aitken, with 15 wins in 1909–1916).

=== Revisionist champion designation ===

During the years that Harroun was driving, the AAA designated some races each year as &quot;championship&quot; events. However, there was no actual year-long points championship, and no points were awarded by the AAA Contest Board. In 1927, the Contest Board negated their history; points were assigned retroactively, and National Champions were designated for those years. At that time, Harroun was designated the champion for the 1910 season. Historians consider these revised results to be unofficial.

=== The inaugural Indianapolis 500 ===

At the inaugural Indianapolis 500 in 1911, Harroun&#x27;s use of what would now be called a rear-view mirror, rather than the riding mechanic specified in the rules, created controversy, but was ultimately allowed. Harroun went on to win at an average speed of . Harroun, who came out of retirement to race in the first 500, would not race after 1911. Harroun&#x27;s historic Firestone-shod yellow #32 Marmon &quot;Wasp,&quot; in which he won the Indianapolis 500, is on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum.

The 50th Anniversary race in 1961 was won by A. J. Foyt, and both Harroun and Foyt appeared together on the television program &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;—their secret being their respective wins at Indianapolis.

=== Later career ===

After retiring from racing, Harroun continued engineering work for Marmon, and later for the Maxwell racing team.

In 1916, Harroun started his own automobile company in Wayne, Michigan, called the Harroun Motor Car Company. The venture folded after World War I, and today a street in Wayne is named for him.

In 1927 he joined Lincoln Products.

He continued to work in the automotive industry until his retirement at age 79. He died on January 19, 1968.

=== Legacy ===

Harroun was inducted in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 1952, the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2000, and the Michigan Motorsports Hall of Fame(www.mmshof.org) in 2010.

<text>Neo (born as Thomas A. Anderson, also known as The One, an anagram of Neo) is a fictional character and the protagonist of &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise, created by the Wachowskis. He was portrayed as a cybercriminal and computer programmer by Keanu Reeves in the films, as well as having a cameo in &quot;The Animatrix&quot; short film &quot;Kid&#x27;s Story&quot;. Andrew Bowen provided Neo&#x27;s voice in &quot;The Matrix: Path of Neo&quot;. In 2021, Reeves reprised his role in &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; with what &quot;Vulture&quot; calls &quot;his signature John Wick look&quot;.

In 2008, Neo was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; as the 68th Greatest Movie Character of All Time. &quot;Neo&quot; is also an anagram of &quot;one&quot;, a reference to his destiny of being &quot;The One&quot; who would bring peace. There are claims that a nightclub in Chicago inspired the name of the character. Neo is considered to be a superhero.

==Fictional character biography==
Thomas A. Anderson was born in Lower Downtown, Capital City, USA on March 11, 1962, according to his criminal record, or September 13, 1971 according to his passport (both seen in the film). His mother was Michelle McGahey (the name of the first film&#x27;s art director) and his father was John Anderson. He attended Central West Junior High and Owen Patterson High (named after the film&#x27;s production designer). In high school, he excelled at science, math and computer courses, and displayed an aptitude for literature and history. Although he had disciplinary troubles when he was thirteen to fourteen years old, Anderson went on to become a respected member of the school community through his involvement in football and hockey.

At the start of the series, Neo is one of billions of humans neurally connected to the Matrix, unaware that the world he lives in is a simulated reality.

===&quot;The Matrix&quot;===

In his normal life, he is a quiet programmer for the &quot;respectable software company&quot; Meta Cortex, while in private, he is a computer hacker who penetrates computer systems illicitly and steals information under his hacker alias &quot;Neo&quot;. He also sells illegal untraceable computer systems and hacking programs along with controlling computer viruses stashed on CDs and diskettes. During his time as a hacker, Anderson has learned about something known only as &quot;The Matrix&quot;.

During the years prior to the events of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, Neo has spent his time trying to find the one man who he thought could tell him what the Matrix was, a supposed terrorist known only as Morpheus. After an encounter with another hacker, Trinity, Anderson is suddenly contacted by Morpheus via a cell phone mailed to his office, but is almost immediately captured by the virtual reality&#x27;s Agents, led by Agent Smith. After refusing to cooperate with the agents, Neo has an electronic bug implanted within his Matrix-simulated body so that his actions can be tracked, and those seeking to make contact from the free world can be traced and destroyed. He is then contacted by Trinity, freed from the bug, and taken to meet Morpheus.

Neo is offered a choice to remain in his everyday life and forget about the Matrix or to learn what the Matrix really is. Choosing the latter option, he takes a drug (commonly called the &quot;red pill&quot;), which is actually a program designed to disrupt his mind&#x27;s neural connection to the Matrix and make it easier for his real body to be found and awakened in the real world. He wakes up disoriented and alarmed to find himself naked, weak, and hairless in a pod full of what can be assumed to be an artificial amniotic fluid. He also discovers that he is connected to a series of thick cables, by way of a number of plugs that are grafted to his body, including one plugged directly into the base of his skull, which is later explained as the means through which his mind was connected to the Matrix. Upon his &quot;birthing&quot; into the real world, he is discovered by a machine that grabs him by the neck and removes all of his plugs and cables before flushing him out of his fluid tank down into the cold sewers below the Earth&#x27;s surface.

Neo is rescued by Morpheus, and his body is healed of the effects of his atrophy incurred while inside the pod. Once Neo regains consciousness and mobility, Morpheus tells Neo the truth about the Matrix; it is a simulated world to which humans are connected, &quot;a prison for your mind&quot;, as stated by Morpheus, while unknown to them, their bodies are used as a power source for a race of sentient machines that, ironically, mankind created. He also tells Neo about the One, a human with the power to manipulate the Matrix, who has been foretold to end the war between humans and machines, and says that he believes Neo is the One.

The next day, Neo begins his &quot;training&quot; and eventually masters many forms of combat, as well as vehicle and weapons operations, by having various training programs uploaded directly into his brain. He also receives further instruction from Morpheus on subjects such as &quot;freeing his mind&quot; from the restrictions of the Matrix, essentially overcoming the physics engine the Matrix operates on. He is also informed of the existence of its agents, programs designed by the machines to maintain order and dominance over the human race, created with abilities such as dodging bullets, running at high speeds, jumping great distances, and physically possessing people in the Matrix. If killed, they simply find a new host to overcome.

After several days aboard Morpheus&#x27; hovercraft, the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;, Neo is taken to meet the Oracle, who has the power of foresight within the simulated world. She tells him that he has the &quot;gift&quot;, but appeared to be waiting for something, and that in his present life he is not the One. The Oracle warns him that a situation will arise when he will have to choose between saving his own life or that of Morpheus.

Returning from the Oracle to a landline phone, which serves as the exit for &quot;red pills&quot; to leave the Matrix, the crew of Morpheus&#x27;s ship is betrayed by Cypher, a &quot;red pill&quot; who is willing to give the agents Morpheus in exchange for the promise of being mentally erased and reconnected permanently to the Matrix as an escape from the real world&#x27;s bleakness. In the Matrix, SWAT troops kill Mouse. Cypher jacks out and grabs a real-world lightning gun, injuring Tank and killing Dozer. He kills Apoc and Switch, who remain jacked in, by prematurely terminating their connections. In the Matrix, Smith defeats and captures Morpheus. Neo and Trinity try to jack out, but Cypher threatens to unplug them too; however, he is thwarted when Tank recovers, killing Cypher and helping Neo and Trinity jack out.

Neo learns that the Agents seek to hack into Morpheus&#x27;s brain in order to force him to tell them the access codes to the mainframe computer within humanity&#x27;s last refuge, the city of Zion. After refusing to sacrifice Morpheus to prevent this, Neo decides to jack in and attack the building where he is being held. He and Trinity proceed to fight their way to the roof level of the building, where they are confronted by agent Jones. Neo unloads two entire magazines on Jones as he dodges each bullet effortlessly. When Jones returns fire, Neo proves capable of dodging bullets himself, fluidly moving in a way only an agent was thought to be capable of, although he is not yet as fast as them, as his leg is grazed by a bullet. Trinity then shoots Jones at point-blank range. Using an armed chopper, Neo and Trinity successfully rescue Morpheus. As Neo has just successfully rescued comrades from a building protected by heavily armed guards and agents (thought to be an unprecedented feat), Tank and Morpheus both believe that Neo is indeed the One. Neo tries to tell Morpheus what the Oracle told him, but Morpheus explains that she merely told Neo what he needed to hear; had he believed himself to be the One, he would likely not have attempted the rescue, which was a necessary step to his emergence as the One.

Reaching the landline phone, Morpheus and Trinity return to the real world, but Neo is trapped by agent Smith. Trinity admonishes Neo to run, but he stands his ground, having begun to believe that he may be the One. Neo and Smith draw guns and fire them empty, but are able to effortlessly dodge each other&#x27;s fire. Neo skillfully engages Smith in hand-to-hand combat, almost seeming to be Smith&#x27;s equal. In the end, Neo is briefly incapacitated and held by Smith as a subway train approaches, but at the last minute, he is able to get free and backflip up onto the platform, leaving Smith to be run over. However, the agent possesses the body of the conductor and emerges from the train. Neo, realizing that the agents&#x27; ability to possess other bodies makes this a fight he cannot win, flees the subway station.

Pursued by Smith and his fellow agents, Neo is able to evade them and reach the location of the landline phone, just to be ambushed and fatally shot in the chest by Smith. Trinity, seeing Neo die in the real world while his mind is still in the Matrix, tells his evidently lifeless body that the Oracle had foretold that she would fall in love with the One. When kissed by Trinity, Neo is revived, finally fully emerging as the One. When the agents try to kill him again, Neo simply raises his hand, and the bullets freeze in mid-air, then drop harmlessly to the ground. It is then shown that he is able to perceive, interpret, and alter the computer code of the Matrix. Completely believing in his new-found powers, he effortlessly fends off agent Smith before forcing himself into the agent&#x27;s body and destroying it from within. The other two agents quickly flee.

Neo is then seen leaving a message for the machines via phone, warning that he plans to oppose them by freeing as many human minds as possible. He then hangs up and flies into the sky, now having completely made his final metamorphosis into becoming the One.

===&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;===

Approximately six months have passed since the events of the first film, and Neo, now Trinity&#x27;s lover and fully confident in his powers as the One, is able to tremendously manipulate the artificial world within the Matrix. He no longer requires firearms, relying solely on hand-to-hand combat. His ability to influence the coding of the Matrix allows him to stop incoming fire from multiple attackers. Dispensing with the long black trenchcoat and black shirt he wears at the conclusion of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, Neo now prefers a cassock with a high-rise mandarin collar giving the appearance of a priest or bishop. Neo seeks more advice from the Oracle, unsure of his purpose, while Zion prepares for a massive attack by the Machines from over 250,000 sentinels, numbered precisely relative to the population of Zion of 250,000 people. The Oracle directs him on a quest to find the Keymaker, a personified program that has access to numerous backdoors within the system and will be able to lead Neo safely to the Source, the programming heart of the machine world, which contains the programs sustaining the Matrix.

After the Oracle leaves, Agent Smith (aka Smith) appears and it is revealed that Neo had separated Smith from the rest of the Matrix code by shattering him, giving him a life independent of the machine&#x27;s systems and now the two of them share a &quot;connection&quot; to each other. Smith is no longer an agent of the Matrix, but has become more virus-like; he is able to insert his code into other systems, and infect other programs and human minds to make copies of himself. Neo fends off hundreds of these Smiths and escapes. Later, he, Morpheus and Trinity steal the Keymaker from his keeper, the Merovingian. During this time, Neo stays behind to fight off the Merovingian&#x27;s men and becomes separated from the others, being trapped in the Merovingian&#x27;s mansion five hundred miles away in the mountains. He flies off to help them and only just arrives in time to save Morpheus and the Keymaker from two agents crashing two trucks together.

The Keymaker explains that two power stations elsewhere in the Matrix must be disabled in a short time window to successfully disable the security system of a building where the door to the Source will appear, allowing Neo to reach it. This task is accomplished, but the Keymaker is killed, a hovercraft is destroyed and Trinity is jeopardized by the agents of the Matrix, illustrating a vision that Neo has seen earlier in his dreams. Entering the door, Neo finds himself confronted by the Architect, a program which created and designed the Matrix and also ensures its constant stability.

The Architect presents Neo with a radically different explanation of his origins and purpose, claiming that Neo is actually the sixth &quot;One&quot;. He goes on to say that Zion has been destroyed by the machines five times before; faced with the dilemma of allowing humanity to be destroyed or allowing the machines&#x27; preferred status quo to be reconstructed, Neo&#x27;s five predecessors have helped reload or restart the Matrix, before being allowed to rebuild Zion with a handful of freed humans. The productive output of the Matrix is based upon this repeated cycle of destruction and recreation, to keep the human minds which power it in a stable structure because not every human accepts the simulated reality and if enough of them accumulate, it could cause a catastrophic system crash of the Matrix and subsequent extinction of both humanity and the Machines. The Oracle is as much part of that self-perpetuating design as the Architect and the prophecy of the One is designed to ensure it runs smoothly each time.

The Architect warns of the annihilation of all human life in and out of the Matrix if he does not enter the Source door to reload the Matrix, but unlike his predecessors, Neo does not enter the door to the Source; he chooses not to believe the Architect&#x27;s dire warnings of consequences and to save Trinity instead. Returning to the Matrix, he catches Trinity as she falls from an upper-story window of a power plant. She dies of a gunshot wound to the heart that she sustains during the fall, but Neo brings her back to life by reaching into her virtual body, removing the bullet and restarting her heart.

Together, they exit the Matrix and return to the real world. Neo tells Morpheus that the prophecy was merely another system of control and that Zion&#x27;s destruction is imminent. A group of sentinels begin to converge on their hovercraft, so Neo and the others are forced to abandon it and flee as it is destroyed. As they flee, Neo suddenly discovers that he can now sense the sentinels and shuts them down telepathically; however, the effort causes him to fall unconscious. He and the crew are rescued by the hovercraft &quot;Mjolnir&quot; (also known as the &quot;Hammer&quot;) whose crew is dealing with a mystery in the form of Bane, a crew member from another ship who is the only survivor of an ill-fated attack by the Zion fleet. Unbeknownst to anyone, Bane&#x27;s mind was destroyed by Smith at some point during the movie&#x27;s events during which Smith overwrote himself over Bane&#x27;s avatar, effectively killing Bane and once he was unplugged, taking over Bane&#x27;s real body.

===&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;===

&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; begins immediately after the events of the second movie; as a result of his struggle with the sentinels, Neo returns to consciousness finding himself caught in an isolated train station-like limbo only accessible by order of the Merovingian, from which his mind is unable to free itself. It is here that he meets Sati, a young program created without a purpose, who is being smuggled into the Matrix by her parents, also programs in the machine world. Neo remains trapped until he is freed by Trinity (assisted by Morpheus and Seraph), who threatens the Merovingian in a Mexican standoff.

After a final visit to the Oracle, Neo learns that he has powers over the machines which extend beyond the Matrix and that Smith is spreading, threatening to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. Building on the Oracle&#x27;s previous explanations about the nature of choice, Neo learns that the Architect&#x27;s assertion that his choice to save Trinity would inherently lead to the extinction of humankind was incorrect, due to his nature as a purely mathematical being rendering him incapable of seeing past choices made by humans, as he considers them mere variables in equations. Having told Neo that he now has the power to choose to end the war and defeat Smith, the Oracle then states &quot;everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo&quot; and informs him that in order for true peace to happen, he must travel to the heavily guarded Machine City in the real world and make a truce with the machines in order to save both races from extinction because of Smith&#x27;s activities. Soon after Neo leaves, dozens of Smiths come and assimilate Seraph, Sati and the Oracle.

Neo and Trinity are given the &quot;Logos&quot;, a hovercraft commanded by Morpheus&#x27;s former lover, Niobe, in what seems to others as a suicidal journey to the Machine City. Meanwhile, Captain Roland and the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;″s surviving crew of Link and Morpheus in the hovercraft &quot;Hammer/Mjolnir&quot; return to Zion, which is now besieged and losing to the Machines. Neo and Trinity are ambushed by the stowaway Bane/Smith, who blinds Neo with an electric cable, but is killed when Neo discovers an ability to &quot;see&quot; programs and machines independently without his eyesight. Neo, with Trinity as pilot, guides the &quot;Logos&quot; past the Machine City&#x27;s defenses, but in the effort the &quot;Logos&quot; crash-lands, and Trinity sustains fatal injuries and dies.

Neo encounters the Deus Ex Machina, a giant machine construct and the leader of the machines. He offers Smith&#x27;s defeat and destruction to the Deus in exchange for a truce. The offer is accepted; Neo enters the Matrix to find that Smith has copied himself throughout the simulated world, now truly threatening the safety and stability of the Matrix. One of the copies of Smith, having assimilated the Oracle and obtained as much freedom and control over the virtual world as Neo, faces Neo alone. For a while, the two fight evenly with no real advantage, but ultimately, the tireless Smith begins to wear out Neo and takes control of the fight. Realizing that he cannot win with brute force, Neo allows Smith to assimilate him, which enables the machines to eradicate the Smith virus directly through his body. Unfortunately, the process also kills Neo.

Neo&#x27;s body is taken away by the machines in the Machine City, while below in Zion, the machines stop their attack and depart in deference to the peace that Neo bartered. The Matrix is rebooted and a beautiful sunrise appears over the horizon, created by Sati in Neo&#x27;s honor.

===&quot;The Matrix Online&quot;===

The fate of Neo was never truly revealed in the MMORPG sequel, &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, however, despite this, his influence had a strong impact on several key events throughout the game.

In the beginning, scattered code fragments of Neo&#x27;s &quot;RSI&quot; (Residual Self Image) were found on the bodies of the impostor agents; who appeared across the Mega City during Chapter 1.1 (later revealed to be sentinels under the command of the general program) when held, these fragments echoed some of the final thoughts of Neo inside the redpill&#x27;s mind. Each of the three main post-war political organizations inside the Matrix realized the possible significance of these fragments and began fighting amongst themselves to gather as many as they could.

The Oracle reveals a secret society of exiles known only as the Shapers, who are the only ones able to bring the Fragments together in any significant way and that they must be protected from the impostor agents&#x27; corruption. The redpills&#x27; distrust and organizational differences prove too much for any strong unity, so that a shaper fell into the captivity of the false agents. His power was used to encode some part of the One&#x27;s being onto them, creating the powerful, pale-skinned &quot;N30 Ag3nts&quot;.

In Chapter 1.2, Morpheus states that though the machines never returned Neo&#x27;s physical remains (Neo&#x27;s body in the real world) to Zion, they did not &quot;recycle&quot; them; a reference to the first film, in which Morpheus tells Neo that the machines liquefy deceased occupants of the Matrix to provide organic sustenance for its living inhabitants. This would be the driving force behind Morpheus&#x27; descent into fanatical terrorism against the system in an attempt to force the machines to reveal Neo&#x27;s fate; ultimately leading to his assassination.

The subject of Neo then fell to the side lines for other struggles; until the arrival of the Oligarchs in Chapter 9. The original intruder, Halborn, was notably intrigued by the life of the One and was personally shocked about the implications of Neo&#x27;s ability to affect Machines outside of the simulation had on his search for what he called the &quot;Biological Interface Program&quot;.

After Halborn&#x27;s removal in Chapter 10, little more was questioned until the revelation of the Trinity project, originally headed by the Oracle, in Chapter 12. It was revealed that both Neo and Trinity were actually the culmination of decades of machine research into translating human DNA perfectly into machine code; allowing them to interface directly with technology without the need for simulated interfaces.

===&quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;===

60 years after the events of &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, Neo is now a video game designer and the creator of a video game series simply known as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, which uses Neo&#x27;s previous memories in the plot. Neo is 57 years old in the Matrix program, but 60 years have passed in the real world, making Neo 97 years old. Neo once again lives under the alias Thomas Anderson and although he does not look old, others see him as an aging man with long gray hair. His love, Trinity, who lives under the name &quot;Tiffany&quot;, is married to a man named Chad and has three children. Neo has a series of existential crises, so his therapist has prescribed him with the blue pills. Neo&#x27;s boss approaches him with an idea to make a fourth Matrix game. However, the more Neo and his crew make the game, the less blue pills he takes and he eventually stops taking them. One day, a man known as &quot;Morpheus&quot; approaches Neo with the red pill, but agents and a police force storm the building where Neo works in order to kill Morpheus, who is revealed as a rogue agent who opened his mind and decided to help Neo destroy the Matrix. Morpheus kills several police officers while Neo&#x27;s boss picks up an officer&#x27;s gun and once again becomes Agent Smith.

The attack was revealed to be a dream, and Neo was still in his therapist&#x27;s room. A drunk Neo later goes on a rooftop and questions his existence. However, a woman with blue hair and a trench coat appears besides him. The woman introduces herself as Bugs, who tries to reopen his mind through a White Rabbit tattoo. Bugs then shows Neo her crew in an abandoned theater. Morpheus, part of Bugs&#x27; group once again, offers a blue pill and a red pill to Neo, who takes the red pill. The team then &quot;unplugs&quot; Neo and with the help of a friendly machine, who was hacked, he is revived in the real world inside Bugs&#x27; ship, the &quot;Mnemosyne&quot;.

In the real world, after Morpheus helps Neo regain his memories and fighting style, the &quot;Mnemosyne&quot; goes to Io, the last human city led by Niobe. Niobe reveals that, when Zion was nearly destroyed by the machines, she and the rest of the inhabitants escaped and made a new city. After sixty years, Niobe does not trust Neo, but lets the &quot;Mnemosyne&quot; crew destroy the Matrix with the help of Sati, the sentient program who helped Neo in &quot;Revolutions&quot;. In the Matrix, Neo&#x27;s therapist, named the Analyst, a program designed to study the human psyche and the new leader of both the Matrix and the machines, explains that after Neo and Trinity&#x27;s deaths, he was able to resurrect them to study them. He found that suppressing their memories but keeping them close to one another made the Matrix more power-efficient and more resistant to the anomalies that caused the previous iterations to fail. However, Neo&#x27;s liberation destabilized the system and triggered a fail-safe to reboot the Matrix. The Analyst stalled the reboot by convincing his superiors that threatening to kill Trinity would get Neo to voluntarily return to his pod. The Analyst then taunts Neo in the Matrix with bullet time by threatening to kill Trinity with a pistol, and then forces Neo to meet him in a café that he and Trinity had frequented. The crew then uses that opportunity to unplug Trinity. At the café, surrounded by riot officers, Neo distracts the Analyst while the team unplugs Trinity. They successfully unplug her, and Trinity gets her memories back and helps Neo fight the officers. Eventually, Smith fights the two, but gets away. In a final attempt to get rid of Neo and Trinity, the Analyst activates the Swarm, which forces many people to try to kill Bugs&#x27; team. The team survives, and when Neo and Trinity are cornered by police helicopters, they then decide to fly, which indeed does happen. The Analyst is defeated, and Neo and Trinity finally rekindle their romance and remake the Matrix in their own image.

==Casting choices==
Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Nicolas Cage, and Leonardo DiCaprio were approached for the role. Will Smith, who turned down the role to make &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, later said he regretted the decision. Ewan McGregor was said to have been sent the script to the movie, but later turned it down and moved on to do &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. Sandra Bullock was asked by the film&#x27;s producers to star in the film, thus changing the gender of the character to female, only to receive a negative answer by Bullock.

==Powers and abilities==
Neo has carried, since his conception, the Matrix&#x27;s source code known as the Prime Program. This gives him the ability to freely manipulate the simulated reality of the Matrix, similar to the authority a system administrator has over a given system. He manifests these abilities as various superhuman powers.
The power Neo exhibits most often is akin to telekinesis in the Matrix. In that, he seems capable of manipulating any object in the Matrix through will alone. By focusing this ability upon himself, he can fly at amazing speeds and jump great distances. Whilst his speed is never specified, he flies from the Merovingian&#x27;s mountain manor to the highway &quot;500 miles due south&quot; in a very short time. It can thus be extrapolated that if it took him roughly 10 minutes to fly from the château in the mountains to the freeway in the Mega City, he would have to have been flying at around 3,000 mph, or just shy of Mach 4. However, his speed of flight is further exemplified by his ability to escape explosions, and the sonic boom left in his wake has the power to overturn rows of heavy vehicles and reap massive destruction, indicating he can probably fly much faster than Mach 4 when pressed. He has used this ability multiple times to stop several bullets in mid flight, first against the Agents and again against the Merovingian.
In addition to his abilities, Neo possesses superhuman strength and agility, and is near-invulnerable to most attacks. Although his physical endurance is immense, Neo can still be harmed or killed, as evidenced by an injury that Neo suffers while blocking a sword attack with his bare hand. His endurance is also finite: when confronted by masses of Smith clones in the second film, Neo was forced to escape rather than continue fighting though he easily overpowered at least 40 Smith clones and threw about 50 off him, and upon being disconnected from the Matrix, he appeared exhausted and winded. His reflexes are great enough to dodge bullets. Neo&#x27;s strength and speed level have never been accurately measured; he is known to be capable of Mach 8, at least, and Mach 10 under stress, but his upper limit has never been shown. In the third movie, Neo has reached his (apparent) full strength; he is capable of withstanding a direct physical punch from the Smith enhanced by the Oracle&#x27;s power, and is also able to hold his own in a prolonged fight (though his endurance is not without limit; he can fight this Smith to a standstill, but not defeat him).

In the real world, like the other rebels, Neo does not display any of the aforementioned abilities. According to the Oracle, &quot;The power of The One extends beyond the Matrix. It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.&quot; Apparently because of his status as The One, he has a direct connection to the Source in the real world, and can therefore affect everything connected to it, including Sentinels, although the first use of this ability overwhelms him and he falls into a coma as his mind somehow plugs into the Matrix without a physical connection. Neo also begins to perceive everything connected to the Source, including the Machine City itself, as silhouettes of golden light. This ability becomes beneficial after he is blinded in the fight against Smith/Bane, thus he is able to see Smith/Bane and kill him.

In &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, the resurrected Neo at first doesn&#x27;t have access to his powers, although he slowly regains them over time, particularly during his fight with Smith. Neo is now able to create powerful telekinetic shockwaves, particularly when touching Trinity, and while he can still stop bullets, it appears to take him more effort. At one point, he telekinetically deflects a missile into a helicopter and shields himself from Smith smashing a porcelain sink down on his head. However, he is unable to fly while trying to escape from the Analyst&#x27;s forces after reuniting with Trinity or after jumping off of a roof. Instead, Trinity develops the ability to fly and takes them both to safety. Neo appears to have regained his full powers by the end of the movie as he and Trinity fly off together after confronting the Analyst.

=== Martial arts styles ===
Neo uses a variety of martial arts styles across the four &quot;Matrix&quot; movies. In the first film, Neo&#x27;s skill in martial arts was shown being downloaded into his brain, which granted combat abilities equivalent to a martial artist with decades of experience. As part of the preparation for the movie, Yuen Woo-ping had Keanu Reeves undertake four months of martial arts training in a variety of different styles. Ju-Jitsu, Taekwondo, Drunken Boxing, Kenpo Karate and Kung fu are some of what Neo learns as part of his computerised combat training. But in the real world, Neo does not display any of the aforementioned martial arts skills.

<text>A transient lunar phenomenon (TLP) or lunar transient phenomenon (LTP) is a short-lived change in light, color or appearance on the surface of the Moon. The term was created by Patrick Moore in his co-authorship of NASA Technical Report R-277 &quot;Chronological Catalog of Reported Lunar Events&quot;, published in 1968.

Claims of short-lived lunar phenomena go back at least 1,000 years, with some having been observed independently by multiple witnesses or reputable scientists. Nevertheless, the majority of transient lunar phenomenon reports are irreproducible and do not possess adequate control experiments that could be used to distinguish among alternative hypotheses to explain their origins. 

Most lunar scientists will acknowledge that transient events such as outgassing and impact cratering do occur over geologic time. The controversy lies in the frequency of such events.

==Description of events==
Reports of transient lunar phenomena range from foggy patches to permanent changes of the lunar landscape. Cameron classifies these as (1) gaseous, involving mists and other forms of obscuration, (2) reddish colorations, (3) green, blue or violet colorations, (4) brightenings, and (5) darkening. Two extensive catalogs of transient lunar phenomena exist, with the most recent tallying 2,254 events going back to the 6th century. Of the most reliable of these events, at least one-third come from the vicinity of the Aristarchus plateau.

An overview of the more famous historical accounts of transient phenomena include the following:

===Pre 1700===
* On June 18, 1178, five or more monks from Canterbury reported an upheaval on the Moon shortly after sunset: This description appears outlandish, perhaps due to the writer&#x27;s and viewers&#x27; lack of understanding of astronomical phenomena. In 1976, Jack Hartung proposed that this described the formation of the Giordano Bruno crater. However, more recent studies suggest that it appears very unlikely the 1178 event was related to the formation of Crater Giordano Bruno, or was even a true transient lunar phenomenon at all. The millions of tons of lunar debris ejected from an impact large enough to leave a 22-km-wide crater would have resulted in an unprecedentedly intense, week-long meteor storm on Earth. No accounts of such a memorable storm have been found in any known historical records, including several astronomical archives from around the world. In light of this, it is suspected that the group of monks (the event&#x27;s only known witnesses) saw the atmospheric explosion of a directly oncoming meteor in chance alignment, from their specific vantage point, with the far more distant Moon.
* On November 26, 1540, a transient phenomenon appeared between Mare Serenitatis and Mare Imbrium. This event is depicted on a contemporary woodcut.

===1701–1800===
* On the evening of August 16, 1725, the Italian astronomer Francesco Bianchini saw a reddish light streak across the floor of crater Plato, &quot;like a bar stretching straight from one end to the other&quot; along the major axis of the foreshortened elliptical shape of the crater.
*During the night of April 19, 1787, the British astronomer Sir William Herschel noticed three red glowing spots on the dark part of the Moon. He informed King George III and other astronomers of his observations. Herschel attributed the phenomena to erupting volcanoes and perceived the luminosity of the brightest of the three as greater than the brightness of a comet that had been discovered on April 10. His observations were made while an aurora borealis (northern lights) rippled above Padua, Italy. Aurora activity that far south from the Arctic Circle was very rare. Padua&#x27;s display and Herschel&#x27;s observations had happened a few days before the number of sunspots had peaked in May 1787.
*In December 1787, a &quot;luminous point&quot; was seen by a Maltese observer named d&#x27;Angos.
*On September 26, 1789, the German astronomer Johann Hieronymus Schröter noticed a speck of light close to the eastern foot of the Montes Alpes. It was seen on the night side of the Moon and appeared like a star of Magnitude 5 to the naked eye.
*On October 15, 1789, J.H.Schröter observed two bright bursts of light, each one of them composed of many single, separate small sparks, appearing on the night side of the Moon near crater Plato and Mare Imbrium.
*In 1790, Sir William Herschel saw one or more star-like appearances on the eclipsed Moon.
*On November 1–2, 1791, J.H.Schröter noticed the bowl-shaped crater Posidonius A on the floor of crater Posidonius without internal shadow.
*In 1794, a report circulated that it was possible to see a volcano on the Moon with the naked eye.

===1801–1900===
*Between 1830 and 1840, the German astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler observed a strong reddish tint closely east of crater Lichtenberg in Oceanus Procellarum. See also Barcroft in 1940, Haas at a later date, Baum in 1951, and Hill in 1988.
*On November 24, 1865, Williams and two others observed for one hour and a half a distinct bright speck like an 8 magnitude star on the dark side near crater Carlini in Mare Imbrium.
*In 1866, the experienced lunar observer and mapmaker J. F. Julius Schmidt claimed that the Linné crater had changed its appearance. Based on drawings made earlier by J. H. Schröter, as well as personal observations and drawings made between 1841 and 1843, he stated that the crater &quot;at the time of oblique illumination &quot;cannot at all be seen&quot;&quot; (his emphasis), whereas at high illumination, it was visible as a bright spot. Based on repeat observations, he further stated that &quot;Linné can never be seen under any illumination as a crater of the normal type&quot; and that &quot;a local change has taken place&quot;. Today, Linné is visible as a normal young impact crater with a diameter of about 1.5 miles (2.4 km).
*On January 4, 1873, French astronomer Étienne Léopold Trouvelot observed crater Kant which was &quot;filled with mist&quot;.
*On August 31, 1877, English amateur astronomer Arthur Stanley Williams noticed some sort of phosphorescent glow on the shadowed southern part of the walled plain Plato.
*On August 6–7, 1881, German astronomer Hermann Joseph Klein observed the region of craters Aristarchus and Herodotus, and noticed a strong violet glare with some sort of nebulosity.
*On March 27, 1882, A.S.Williams saw the floor of Plato at sunrise &quot;glowing with a curious milky kind of light&quot;.
*On July 3, 1882, several residents of Lebanon, Connecticut, observed two pyramidal luminous protuberances on the Moon&#x27;s upper limb. They were not large, but gave the Moon a look strikingly like that of a horned owl or the head of an English bull terrier.
*On February 19, 1885, Gray saw a small crater near the larger crater Hercules glow dull red &quot;with vivid contrast&quot;.
*On February 21, 1885, Knopp observed red patches in crater Cassini.
*In 1887, French amateur astronomer and selenographer Casimir Marie Gaudibert noticed a temporary white spot in the central part of crater Herodotus.
*One night in 1892, American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard found the bowl of crater Thales filled with luminous haze.
*1891–1897, American astronomer William Henry Pickering gives drawings of a probable eruption of &quot;steam&quot; from crater Schröter.
*A photograph made on August 26, 1898, through the &quot;équatorial coudé&quot;, shows bowl-shaped craterlet Posidonius C on the floor of crater Posidonius as a bright spot without shadow, although the &quot;terminator&quot; (day-night boundary) was nearby.

===1901–1950===
*A photograph made on September 30, 1901, through the &quot;équatorial coudé&quot;, shows bowl-shaped craterlet Posidonius C as an elongated bright spot without shadow, although the photograph was made shortly before sunset at crater Posidonius.
*In 1902, French astronomer Albert Charbonneaux, using the Meudon 33-inch refractor telescope at the Paris Observatory, noticed a small white cloud west of crater Theaetetus.
*In 1905, German astronomer Friedrich Simon Archenhold observed a bright spot at the location of the bowl-shaped craterlet Posidonius C on the floor of crater Posidonius.
*On May 19, 1912, Austrian astronomer and rocketry pioneer Max Valier noticed a small red glowing area on the Moon&#x27;s night side.
*In January 1913, William Henry Pickering observed the last one of a series of &quot;eruptions&quot; of some sort of white material at crater Eimmart.
*On June 15, 1913, the British civil engineer and astronomer William Maw observed a &#x27;small reddish spot&#x27; in crater South.
*On February 22, 1931, Joulia observed a reddish glow in crater Aristarchus. In the same year (1931) and at the same location, British businessman and amateur astronomer Walter Goodacre and (?) &quot;Molesworth&quot; (&quot;1931?&quot;) observed a bluish &#x27;glare&#x27;. Percy B. Molesworth ? (1867–1908).
*On June 17, 1931, N.J.Giddings and his wife observed unusual flashes of light (&quot;lightning-like phenomena&quot;) on the night side of the Moon.
*On August 2, 1939, British moon observer Patrick Moore noticed that the internal detail of the walled plain Schickard was obliterated by an extensive mist.
*In 1940, American amateur astronomer David P. Barcroft (1897–1974) observed a pronounced reddish-brown color near crater Lichtenberg in Oceanus Procellarum. See also J.H.Mädler between 1830 and 1840, Baum in 1951, and Hill in 1988.
*On July 10, 1941, American amateur astronomer Walter H. Haas noticed a moving dot of white light near crater Hansteen in the southern section of Oceanus Procellarum.
*On August 31, 1944, the floor of the walled plain Schickard looked misty to the Welsh-born engineer and amateur astronomer Hugh Percy Wilkins. Some minor craters in it, which are normally well shadowed, stood out as white spots under a low sun.
*On January 30, 1947, Harold Hill observed an abnormal absence of the main peak&#x27;s shadow at the central mountain group of crater Eratosthenes.
*On April 15, 1948, F.H.Thornton, using a 9-inch reflector, observed crater Plato and noticed a minute but brilliant flash of light which he described as looking very much like the flash of an AA shell exploding in the air at a distance of about ten miles. In color it was on the orange side of yellow.
*On May 20, 1948, British amateur astronomer Richard M. Baum noted a reddish glow to the northeast of crater Philolaus, which he watched for fifteen minutes before it faded from sight. Three years later he observed another red glow west of crater Lichtenberg.
*On February 10, 1949, F.H.Thornton, using an 18-inch reflector, observed the &quot;Cobra-Head&quot; of Vallis Schroteri and recorded a &quot;puff of whitish vapour obscuring details for some miles in the area&quot;.
*in November 1949, and also in June and July 1950, Bartlett noticed a white spot at the central part of crater Herodotus.

===1951–1960===
*In 1951, Richard Myer Baum (1930–2017) observed the regions near crater Lichtenberg in Oceanus Procellarum and reported a rose-pink coloration which persisted for a time and then faded. See also J.H.Mädler between 1830 and 1840, Barcroft in 1940, and Hill in 1988.
*On November 15, 1953, Dr. Leon Stuart photographed a lunar flare at approximately 10 miles southeast of crater Pallas. The duration of the flare was 8 to 10 seconds. According to Bonnie Buratti, the coordinates of the impacted object are 3.88° Latitude / 357.71° Longitude.
*On May 11, 1954, Peter Cattermole observed the disappearance of the central mountains of crater Eratosthenes, although the surrounding detail remained clearly visible.
*In 1954, Patrick Moore detected curious ray-like features crossing crater Helmholtz.
*On June 25, 1955, mountaineer and amateur astronomer Valdemar Axel Firsoff observed a faint mist in crater Theophilus.
*On July 15, 1955, V.A.Firsoff observed crater Herodotus which had a &#x27;pseudo central peak&#x27; casting a shadow.
*On January 16–17, 1956, Robert Miles of Woodland, Calif., noticed a flash of white or bright blue light east of Mare Crisium.
*On November 2, 1958, the Russian astronomer Nikolai A. Kozyrev observed an apparent half-hour &quot;eruption&quot; that took place on the central peak of Alphonsus crater using a 48-inch (122-cm) reflector telescope equipped with a spectrometer. During this time, the obtained spectra showed evidence for bright gaseous emission bands due to the molecules C2 and C3. While exposing his second spectrogram, he noticed &quot;a marked increase in the brightness of the central region and an unusual white colour.&quot; Then, &quot;all of a sudden the brightness started to decrease&quot; and the resulting spectrum was normal.
*On November 19, 1958, Raymond J. Stein of Newark observed a change in the shadow of crater Alpetragius.
*On December 23, 1958, Greek observers of the moon noticed a greenish coloration at crater Schickard.

===1961–1970===
*On October 29, 1963, two Aeronautical Chart and Information Center cartographers, James Clarke Greenacre and Edward M. Barr, at the Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona, manually recorded very bright red, orange, and pink colour phenomena on the southwest side of Cobra Head; a hill southeast of the lunar valley Vallis Schröteri; and the southwest interior rim of the Aristarchus crater. This event sparked a major change in attitude towards TLP reports. According to Willy Ley: &quot;The first reaction in professional circles was, naturally, surprise, and hard on the heels of the surprise there followed an apologetic attitude, the apologies being directed at a long-dead great astronomer, Sir William Herschel.&quot; A notation by Winifred Sawtell Cameron states (1978, Event Serial No. 778): &quot;This and their November observations started the modern interest and observing the Moon.&quot; The credibility of their findings stemmed from Greenacre&#x27;s exemplary reputation as an impeccable cartographer, rather than from any photographic evidence.
*On the night of November 1–2, 1963, a few days after Greenacre&#x27;s event, at the Observatoire du Pic-du-Midi in the French Pyrenees, Zdeněk Kopal and Thomas Rackham made the first photographs of a &quot;wide area lunar luminescence&quot;. His article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; transformed it into one of the most widely publicized TLP events. Kopal, like others, had argued that Solar Energetic Particles could be the cause of such a phenomenon.
*On July 16, 1964, AAVSO member Thomas A. Cragg (1927–2011) observed a 3 km diameter &quot;temporary hill casting a shadow&quot; southeast of crater Ross D in Mare Tranquillitatis.
*On November 15, 1965, personnel of the Trident Engineering Associates, Inc., Annapolis, Md. observed via Moon-Blink device a color phenomenon which lasted at least four hours.
*On April 30 and May 1, 1966, Peter Sartory, Patrick Moore, P.Ringsdore, T.J.C.A.Moseley, and P.G.Corvan observed a &quot;wedge&quot;-shaped reddish colored appearance on the eastern part of crater Gassendi&#x27;s floor.
*In 1967, T.J.C.A.Moseley of the Armagh Observatory recorded a flash in the area of crater Parrot.
*In 1968, J.C.McConnell reported that the north-east wall of crater Posidonius seemed hazy and obscured; the rest of the crater was clearly visible.
*On April 13, 1968, during the eclipse of the Moon, Winifred Cameron of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center noticed a great many star-like points on the Moon. They were seen by a group of observers who accompanied her.
*K.E.Chilton: &quot;At times, light is polarized in areas on the moon. On the night of September 18, 1968, I was observing the crater Gauss through a polaroid filter to cut down the glare. The eastern wall of the crater was not visible; when the filter was rotated the wall appeared, indicating that the area was reflecting polarized light. Although the same area has been examined since, this phenomenon has not been noticed again&quot;.
*On October 31, 1968, K.E.Chilton observed a red-colored glow in crater Eratosthenes. The glow lasted 5 or 6 minutes and then faded to obscurity.
*During the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, Houston radioed to Apollo 11: &quot;We&#x27;ve got an observation you can make if you have some time up there. There&#x27;s been some lunar transient events reported in the vicinity of Aristarchus.&quot; Astronomers in Bochum, West Germany, had observed a bright glow on the lunar surface—the same sort of eerie luminescence that has intrigued Moon watchers for centuries. The report was passed on to Houston and thence to the astronauts. Neil Armstrong reported back: &quot;Hey, Houston. I&#x27;m looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and I can&#x27;t really tell at that distance whether I really am looking at Aristarchus, but there&#x27;s an area there that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It just has – seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it as a crater can be seen, and the area around the crater is quite bright.&quot;

===1971–1980===
*During the Apollo 17 mission in December 1972, Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt observed a bright flash-like phenomenon north of crater Grimaldi while in orbit around the Moon (First Revolution, 21:11:09 GMT, December 10, 1972).
*While in orbit, Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans of Apollo 17 noticed a light flash eastward of Mare Orientale (14th Revolution, 22:28:27 GMT, December 11, 1972).
*In September 1973, the Dutch author of books on mysterious phenomena Hans van Kampen and a friend (Van Cleef) observed near crater Linné a bright point of light which was visible for almost two minutes.

===1981–1990===
*On December 27, 1982, British Moon observer Harold Hill noticed the absence of the principal craterlet (&quot;Nasmyth A&quot;) on the floor of the crater Nasmyth. A similar phenomenon was noticed by P.Wade on December 8, 1981.
*On January 1, 1983, Harold Hill noticed an unusual bright appearance of craterlet Furnerius A near the pronounced crater Furnerius at the evening terminator.
*On January 29, 1983, several members of the British Astronomical Association (BAA) observed abnormal brightness and purplish coloration at the bowl shaped crater Torricelli B north-northeast of the pear shaped crater Torricelli in Sinus Asperitatis.
*On October 29, 1983, Harold Hill observed abnormal brightness at the hillock just north of crater Kirch.
*On December 28, 1985, Harold Hill observed an extraordinary brilliance at the mid-section of the east inner wall of crater Peirescius.
*On April 1, 1988, Harold Hill noticed rosy-tinged areas fringing the northern edge of the lava sheet near crater Lichtenberg in Oceanus Procellarum. See also J.H.Mädler between 1830 and 1840, Barcroft in 1940, and Baum in 1951.

===1991–2000===
*In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris reported anomalous features on the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a specular reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.

===No date given===
*Johann Hieronymus Schröter once saw for a short time on the dark side, near craters Agrippa and Godin, a minute point of light.
*J.Adams (&quot;English Mechanic&quot; N°2374) noted on two occasions near sunrise, when the interior of the walled plain Plato was filled with shadow, that two beams of light traversed two-thirds of the floor from the western wall resembling searchlights; they were parallel and well-defined, and had the appearance of passing through a slight vapour resting on the surface.
*Harold Hill: &quot;A number of observers have claimed in the past that the inner slopes of the formation Young have a greenish, almost translucent cast or sheen when seen at the evening terminator.&quot;
*Patrick Moore: &quot;There is a darkish streak across the floor of crater Fracastorius which is of a slightly reddish hue, and is detectable with a moonblink device.&quot;
*American amateur astronomer David Barcroft (1897–1974) had seen the crater Timocharis &quot;filled with vapor and very indistinct near full moon&quot;.
*Spanish astronomer Josep Comas i Solà once saw crater Reiner &quot;as a white patch when it should have been sharply defined&quot;.
*T. W. Webb recommended crater Cichus (in the eastern part of Palus Epidemiarum) for further detailed study. In Cichus, a small crater seemed to have grown larger as compared to the earlier representations by Schröter and Mädler.

==Explanations==
Explanations for the transient lunar phenomena fall in four classes: outgassing, impact events, electrostatic phenomena, and unfavorable observation conditions.

===Outgassing===
Some TLPs may be caused by gas escaping from underground cavities. These gaseous events are purported to display a distinctive reddish hue, while others have appeared as white clouds or an indistinct haze. The majority of TLPs appear to be associated with floor-fractured craters, the edges of lunar maria, or in other locations linked by geologists with volcanic activity. However, these are some of the most common targets when viewing the Moon, and this correlation could be an observational bias.

In support of the outgassing hypothesis, data from the Lunar Prospector alpha particle spectrometer indicate the recent outgassing of radon to the surface. In particular, results show that radon gas was emanating from the vicinity of the craters Aristarchus and Kepler during the time of this two-year mission. These observations could be explained by the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events. In support of explosive outgassing, it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km (1.9 mi) diameter region of the lunar surface was &quot;recently&quot; modified by a gas release event. The age of this feature is believed to be about 1 million years old, suggesting that such large phenomena occur only infrequently.

===Impact events===
Impact events are continually occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are those associated with micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations. Tables of impacts recorded by video cameras exist for years since 2005 many of which are associated with meteor showers. Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA&#x27;s SMART-1 spacecraft, India&#x27;s Moon Impact Probe and NASA&#x27;s LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7–20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.

===Electrostatic phenomena===

It has been suggested that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.

===Unfavourable observation conditions===
It is possible that many transient phenomena might not be associated with the Moon itself but could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.

==Debated status of TLPs==
The most significant problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena is that the vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring at the same &quot;place&quot; on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same &quot;event&quot;, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.

One attempt to overcome the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows no discernible differences at these sites. This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as it is possible that outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but neither is it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.

Observations are currently being coordinated by the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers and the British Astronomical Association to re-observe sites where transient lunar phenomena were reported in the past. By documenting the appearance of these features under the same illumination and libration conditions, it is possible to judge whether some reports were simply due to a misinterpretation of what the observer regarded as an abnormality. Furthermore, with digital images, it is possible to simulate atmospheric spectral dispersion, astronomical seeing blur and light scattering by our atmosphere to determine if these phenomena could explain some of the original TLP reports.

<doc id="231255" wikidata="Q1636495" url="?curid=231255" title="Human relations movement">
<text>Human relations movement refers to the researchers of organizational development who study the behaviour of people in groups, particularly in workplace groups and other related concepts in fields such as industrial and organizational psychology. It originated in the 1930s&#x27; Hawthorne studies, which examined the effects of social relations, motivation and employee satisfaction on factory productivity. The movement viewed workers in terms of their psychology and fit with companies, rather than as interchangeable parts, and it resulted in the creation of the discipline of human relations management.

==Mayo&#x27;s work==
Elton Mayo stressed the following:
# The power of natural groups, in which social aspects take precedence over functional organizational structures.
# The need for reciprocal communication, in which communication is two way, from worker to chief executive, as well as vice versa.
# The development of high quality leadership to communicate goals and to ensure effective and coherent decision making.

It has become a concern of all many companies to improve the job-oriented interpersonal skills of employees. The teaching of these skills to employees is referred to as &quot;soft skills&quot; training. Companies need their employees to be able to successfully communicate and convey information, to be able to interpret others&#x27; emotions, to be open to others&#x27; feelings, and to be able to solve conflicts and arrive at resolutions. By acquiring these skills, the employees, those in management positions, and the customer can maintain more compatible relationships.

== Arguments against Mayo&#x27;s involvement in human relations ==

Mayo&#x27;s work is considered by various academics to be the basic counterpoint of Taylorism and scientific management. Taylorism, founded by Frederick W. Taylor, sought to apply science to the management of employees in the workplace in order to gain economic efficiency through labour productivity. Elton Mayo&#x27;s work has been widely attributed to the discovery of the &#x27;social person&#x27;, allowing for workers to be seen as individuals rather than merely robots designed to work for unethical and unrealistic productivity expectations. However, this theory has been contested, as Mayo&#x27;s purported role in the human relations movement has been questioned. Nonetheless, although Taylorism attempted to justify scientific management as a holistic philosophy, rather than a set of principles, the human relations movement worked parallel to the notion of scientific management. Its aim was to address the social welfare needs of workers and therefore elicit their co-operation as a workforce.

The widely perceived view of human relations is said to be one that completely contradicts the traditional views of Taylorism. Whilst scientific management tries to apply science to the workforce, the accepted definition of human relations suggests that management should treat workers as individuals, with individual needs. In doing so, employees are supposed to gain an identity, stability within their job and job satisfaction, which in turn make them more willing to co-operate and contribute their efforts towards accomplishing organisational goals. The human relations movement supported the primacy of organizations to be attributed to natural human groupings, communication and leadership. However, the conventional depiction of the human relations &#x27;school&#x27; of management, rising out of the ashes of scientific management is argued to be a rhetorical distortion of events. 

Firstly, it has been argued that Elton Mayo&#x27;s actual role in the human relations movement is controversial and although he is attributed to be the founder of this movement, some academics believe that the concept of human relations was used well before the Hawthorne investigations, which sparked the human relations movement. Bruce and Nyland (2011) suggest that many academics preceded Mayo in identifying a concept similar to that of the human relations movement even going as far to suggest that the output and information collected by the Hawthorne investigations was identified well before Mayo by Taylor. In addition, Wren and Greenwood (1998) argue that Taylor made important contributions to what inspires human motivation, even though his ultimate findings were somewhat different from the human relations movement.

Another name which has been attributed to pre-existing human relations ideas is that of Henry S. Dennison. The one time president of the Taylor Society has been linked to both Taylorist principles as well human relation ideals thus creating a nexus between Taylorism and human relation thought. Dennison demonstrated an activist concern both with the rationale and character of workers, and with the control and management undertaken by managers of the business enterprise. 

In order to assess the validity of human relations as a benchmark for rights within the workplace, the contribution of Taylorism in comparison to human relations must be established. Taylorism and scientific management entailed to be a &quot;complete mental revolution&quot; and as Taylor explained, Taylorism sought to encourage managers and labourers to &quot;take their eyes off of the division of the surplus as the important matter, and together turn their attention toward increasing the size of the surplus.&quot; This notion of management appealed to the employer as it addressed organisational problems, inefficiencies and adverse employer-employee relations. Scientific management aimed to use science and qualitative data in the selection of employees and facilitate the use of employee databases and performance reviews. Firstly, scientific management aimed to reduce inefficiency through studying the time and motions in work tasks. The object of time studies was to determine how fast a job should and could be done. Secondly, Taylor purported to introduce specific quantitative goals to individual employees in order to provide challenging time restraints and thus increasing productivity. Most importantly, Taylor sought to increase productivity through organization of behaviour.

<text>Duncan Edwin Duncan-Sandys, Baron Duncan-Sandys (; 24 January 1908 – 26 November 1987), was a British politician and minister in successive Conservative governments in the 1950s and 1960s. He was a son-in-law of Winston Churchill and played a key role in promoting European unity after World War II.

==Early life==
Sandys, born on 24 January 1908 at the Manor House, Sandford Orcas, Dorset, was the son of George John Sandys, a Conservative Member of Parliament (1910–1918), and Mildred Helen Cameron. Sandys&#x27;s parents divorced in January 1921 when he was 12 years old. His mother married Frederick Hamilton Lister in October that year, becoming Mildred Helen Lister. He was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford.

== Early career ==
Sandys entered the diplomatic service in 1930, serving at the Foreign Office in London as well as at the embassy in Berlin.

He became Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwood in south London in a by-election in March 1935, at which he was opposed by an Independent Conservative candidate sponsored by Randolph Churchill.

In May 1935, he was in effect saying that Germany should have a predominant place in central Europe, so that Britain could be free to pursue her colonial interests without rival. He was a prewar member of the Anglo-German Fellowship. 

In November 1936 Sandys put forward to the &quot;1912 Club&quot; a &quot;fanciful vision&quot; of England in 1950 (including &quot;peace in Europe&quot;) .

=== The Duncan Sandys case ===
In 1937, Sandys was commissioned into the 51st (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery, of the Territorial Army (TA). In 1938, he asked questions in the House of Commons on matters of national security that reflected his TA experience. He was subsequently approached by two unidentified men, presumably representing the secret services, and threatened with prosecution under section 6 of the Official Secrets Act 1920. Sandys reported the matter to the Committee of Privileges which held that the disclosures of Parliament were not subject to the legislation, though an MP could be disciplined by the House. The Official Secrets Act 1939 was enacted in reaction to this incident.

==Wartime career==
During the Second World War Sandys fought with 51st (London) HAA Regiment in the Norwegian campaign and was wounded in action; this left him with a permanent limp.

His father-in-law gave him his first ministerial post as Financial Secretary to the War Office from 1941 to 1944 during the wartime coalition government. Sandys had been wartime Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply. W. A. Robotham who had been in the Ministry as &quot;Chief Engineer of Tank Design&quot; wrote that he was knowledgeable on army matters. Robotham of Rolls-Royce who had headed development of the Meteor tank engine in WWII was surprised and pleased when in 1963 Sandys said &quot;I regard the adoption of the Meteor tank engine as the absolute turning-point in the history of British tank development&quot;, at the opening of a Rolls-Royce aero engine factory at East Kilbride (aero engines being Rolls-Royce&#x27;s main business).

From 1944 to 1945 he served as Minister of Works for the remainder of the coalition and in the Churchill Caretaker Ministry. While a minister he was chairman of a War Cabinet Committee for defence against German flying bombs and rockets, on which he frequently clashed with the scientist and intelligence expert R. V. Jones. However, he lost his seat in the 1945 general election. He resigned his TA commission as a lieutenant-colonel the following year.

==Co-founder of the European Movement ==

Sandys played a key role in the creation of the European Movement. He established the United Europe Movement in Britain in 1947 following a speech of his father-in-law, Winston Churchill, in Zurich on 19 September 1946 when Churchill had called for the &quot;European family&quot; to be recreated and provided with &quot;a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom&quot;.

In 1947, Joseph Retinger, who had been instrumental in setting up the European League for Economic Cooperation in 1946, approached Sandys, then Honorary Secretary of the UEM, to discuss ways the League and the United Europe Movement might cooperate on questions relating to European integration. They decided to call a small conference of existing organisations working for European unity – the European League for Economic Cooperation, the United Europe Movement, the Nouvelles Equipes Internationales, the European Parliamentary Union, and the European Union of Federalists. This took place in Paris on 20 July 1947 where ELEC, the UEM, the EPU and the EUF agreed to establish the Committee for the Co-ordination of the International Movements for European Unity. The EPU did not however subsequently ratify its participation in the committee but the Nouvelles Equipes Internationales agreed to join. In December 1947, the committee was renamed the International Committee of the Movements for European Unity and Sandys was elected its chairman and Retinger its Honorary Secretary.

The Committee organised the Congress of Europe, held in The Hague from 7–11 May 1948 with 750 delegates from across Europe. Following the Congress, the International Committee was transformed into the European Movement.

Sandys served as a member of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1950 until 1951.

== Post-war parliamentary career ==
Sandys was elected to parliament once again at the 1950 general election for Streatham and, when the Conservatives regained power in 1951, he was appointed Minister of Supply. For most of his time in that role, his private secretary was Jack Charles. As Minister of Housing from 1954, he introduced the Clean Air Act and in 1955 introduced the green belts.

He was appointed Minister of Defence in 1957 and quickly produced the 1957 Defence White Paper that proposed a radical shift in the Royal Air Force by ending the use of fighter aircraft in favour of missile technology. Though later ministers reversed the policy, the lost orders and cuts in research were responsible for several British aircraft manufacturers going out of business. As Minister of Defence he saw the rationalisation (merger) of much of the British military aircraft and engine industry.

Sandys continued as a minister at the Commonwealth Relations Office, later combining it with the Colonies Office, until the Conservative government lost power in 1964. In this role he was responsible for granting several colonies their independence and was involved in managing the British response to several conflicts involving the armed forces of the newly independent countries of East Africa.

He remained in the shadow cabinet until 1966 when he was sacked by Edward Heath. He had strongly supported Ian Smith in the dispute over Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence. He was not offered a post when the Conservatives won the 1970 general election, but instead served as leader of the United Kingdom delegation to the Council of Europe and Western European Union until 1972 when he announced his retirement. The next year he was made a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

In 1974 he retired from parliament and was awarded a life peerage on 2 May. As the title of Baron Sandys was already held by another family, he followed the example of George Brown and incorporated his first name in his title, changing his surname to &quot;Duncan-Sandys&quot;. He was created Baron Duncan-Sandys, &quot;of the City of Westminster&quot;, on 2 May 1974.

He was an active early member of the Conservative Monday Club.

== Personal life ==
In 1935, Sandys married Diana Churchill, daughter of the future prime minister Winston Churchill. They divorced in 1960.

In 1962, he married Marie-Claire (&quot;née&quot; Schmitt), who had been previously married to Robert Hudson, 2nd Viscount Hudson. The marriage lasted until Sandys&#x27;s death.

It has long been speculated that he may have been the &#x27;headless man&#x27; whose identity was concealed during the scandalous divorce trial of Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll, in 1963.

Sandys died on 26 November 1987 at his home in London. He is buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas in Child Okeford, Dorset. His grave is marked by a horizontal white slab.

==Children==
From Sandys&#x27;s first marriage, with Diana Churchill:
*The Hon. Julian Sandys (19 September 1936 – 15 August 1997)
*The Hon. Edwina Sandys (born 22 December 1938)
*The Hon. Celia Sandys (born 18 May 1943). She married firstly Michael Kennedy and secondly Dennis Walters (divorced 1979).

From his second marriage, with Marie-Claire Schmitt:
* The Hon. Laura Sandys (born 5 June 1964). She was a Conservative Member of Parliament for South Thanet.

==Interests==
Among Sandys&#x27;s other interests was historic architecture. He formed the Civic Trust in 1957 and was its president; the Royal Institution of British Architects made him an honorary Fellow in 1968, and the Royal Town Planning Institute made him an honorary member. He was also a trustee of the World Security Trust.

Between 1969 and 1984 he was President of Europa Nostra and acted for the preservation of the European cultural and architectural heritage.

His business activities included a Directorship of the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, which was later part of Lonrho of which he became chairman. He was therefore caught up in the scandal in which Lonrho was revealed to have bribed several African countries and broken international sanctions against Rhodesia, as well as the &quot;unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism&quot; episode involving eight directors being sacked by Tiny Rowland.

<doc id="231263" wikidata="Q817565" url="?curid=231263" title="Benjamin Jowett">
<text>Benjamin Jowett (, modern variant ; 15 April 1817 – 1 October 1893) was an English writer and classical scholar. Additionally, he was an administrative reformer in the University of Oxford, theologian, Anglican cleric, and translator of Plato and Thucydides. He was master of Balliol College, Oxford.

==Early life and education==
Jowett was born in Camberwell, London, the third of nine children. His father was a furrier originally from a Yorkshire family that, for three generations, had been supporters of the Evangelical movement in the Church of England, and an author of a metrical translation of the Old Testament Psalms. His mother, Isabella Langhorne (1790–1869), was related to John Langhorne, the poet and translator of Plutarch. At the age of 12, Jowett was placed on the foundation of St Paul&#x27;s School (then located in St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard) where he soon gained a reputation as a precocious classical scholar. 

At the age of 18, Jowett was awarded an open scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his life. He began his studies in 1836, and was quickly recognised as one of the leading Oxford dons of his generation, made a Fellow while still an undergraduate in 1838; he graduated with first-class honours in 1839. This was at the height of the Oxford Tractarian movement: through the friendship of W. G. Ward, he was drawn for a time in the direction of High Anglicanism; but a stronger and more lasting influence was that of the Arnold school, represented by A. P. Stanley. The controversy caused Jowett to withdraw from High Table at college to lodgings in Broad Street.

==Heretical controversialist==

As early as 1839, Stanley had joined with Archibald Campbell Tait, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, in advocating certain university reforms. From 1846 onwards, Jowett threw himself into this movement, which in 1848 became general amongst the younger and more thoughtful fellows, until it took effect in the commission of 1850 and the Oxford University Act 1854. Jowett then concentrated on theology: he spent the summers of 1845 and 1846 in Germany with Stanley, and became an eager student of German criticism and speculation. His views became more than radical, they were heretical, which severely curtailed prospects for advancement within the walls of the conformity of Anglican Oxford. Amongst the writings of that period he was most impressed by those of F. C. Baur. But he never ceased to exercise an independent judgement, and his work on St Paul, which appeared in 1855, was the result of much original reflection and inquiry.

Jowett found a friend and correspondent in Florence Nightingale, but whether there was any romantic attachment is unclear. It has been suggested that he belatedly proposed marriage, but was rejected, and lived the latter part of his life in regret that he never knew matrimonial bliss. Jowett&#x27;s didactic and pedagogic nature tended him towards instruction of her complicated character accusing her of exaggeration, an emotional intensity occasioned by hysteria. He was a father figure, paternalistic towards a deeply conservative woman, religious, self-censoring and strict in her conduct. Another educational reform, the opening of the Indian Civil Service to competition, took place at the same time, and Jowett was one of the commission. He had two brothers, William and Alfred who had served and died in India, and he never ceased to take a deep and practical interest in Indian affairs. After the Second Royal Commission in May 1859 he called Nightingale &quot;the Governess of Governors of India&quot; for her robust dealings with the poor conditions in Calcutta &quot;the natives themselves ... educated to cleanliness &amp; health by the enforcement of sanitary regulations in the large towns.&quot; When an old man he visited Claydons, where Margaret Verney donated him a print portrait of Nightingale which he later bequested in his will to Somerville College. A. Sorabji, an Indian writer, was a student barrister at Somerville College in 1890s, when the master of Balliol, pointing to the picture declared her love for him: the story was never confirmed. In another story entirely Margot Tennant later wife of Henry Asquith, befriended Jowett, only to learn that he had had a &quot;violent ... very violent&quot; relationship with Nightingale. Jowett was an &quot;éminence grise&quot; of liberal theology but could be somewhat chaotic in his recollections.

==Oxford career==

Jowett was appointed to the Regius Professorship of Greek in autumn 1855. He had been a tutor of Balliol and an Anglican cleric since 1842 and had devoted himself to the work of tuition: his pupils became his friends for life. He discerned their capabilities and taught them to know themselves. This made him a reputation as &quot;the great tutor&quot;.

A great disappointment, his repulse for the mastership of Balliol, also in 1854, appears to have roused him into the completion of his book on &quot;The Epistles of St Paul&quot;. This work, described by one of his friends as &quot;a miracle of boldness&quot;, is full of originality and suggestiveness, but its publication awakened against him a storm of theological opposition from the Orthodox Evangelicals, which followed him more or less through life. Instead of yielding to this, he joined with Henry Bristow Wilson and Rowland Williams, who had been similarly attacked, in the production of the volume known as &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;. This appeared in 1860 and gave rise to a strong outbreak of criticism. Jowett&#x27;s loyalty to those who were prosecuted on this account was no less characteristic than his persistent silence while the augmentation of his salary as Greek professor was withheld. This persecution was continued until 1865, when E. A. Freeman and Charles Elton discovered by historical research that a breach of the conditions of the professorship had occurred, and Christ Church, Oxford, raised the endowment from £40 a year to £500. Jowett was one of the recipients of Nightingale&#x27;s three volume work &quot;Suggestions for Thought&quot; for proof-reading and criticism. In the third volume of &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; he contributed &quot;On the Interpretation of Scripture&quot; in which he attempted to reconcile her assertion that religion was law and could be unified with science. Her radical thoughts on women&#x27;s place in the home, and his departure from liberal Anglican theology helped to block for a decade his career advancement to the mastership of Balliol. By 1860, he was already Regius Professor of Greek and a fellow of Balliol, but an increase in his stipend was withheld. While the work gained fulsome praise from philosopher-politician John Stuart Mill, it profoundly shook the more traditional establishment&#x27;s fervent belief that the working-classes would continue to worship in parish churches. Recognition that this was no longer so, was just one of the theological departures. In October 1862 he was invited to Oak Hill Park to offer Nightingale the sacrament. Accepting the prospect with relish, he nonetheless consulted with Archbishop Tait for permission. Many of his letters to her and Mrs Bracebridge have survived; their religion was tinged with a mutual respect for their shared common interests and intellectual gifts. Also included is an unflattering description of a middle-aged man.

==Height of intellectual powers==

Meanwhile, Jowett&#x27;s influence at Oxford had steadily increased; he had his favourites. It culminated when the country clergy, provoked by the final acquittal of the essayists, had voted in convocation against the endowment of the Greek chair. Jowett&#x27;s pupils, who were now drawn from the university at large, supported him with enthusiasm. He made friends with the Freemantles (related to Gladstone&#x27;s minister, Grant Duff), and the Verneys at Claydons. On holiday in Derbyshire he would write to them and Nightingale, describing his findings at Lea Hurst in 1864. One historian has identified his relations with her as being most intense between 1863 and 1866: in April 1864, he had advised Florence Nightingale to prevent Garibaldi, her world-famous guest, from stirring up trouble in Italy. This coincided with a big philosophical argument in which they were poles apart: there were three major pieces of sanitary legislation, the Contagious Diseases Acts, which in 1870 came under fire from Josephine Butler, a feminist and social reformer, who wished their repeal. The rational theologian in Jowett warned Nightingale to ignore those &quot;on the wrong tack&quot;. Rising incidents of venereal disease posed a moral question about whether to regulate prostitution, when men still might die from the infection. Policing of the health conditions became a case for which women&#x27;s rights campaigners demanded repeal, and they launched a vociferous attack in the press on Jowett, amongst others. He was a compassionate man, visiting the selfless Hilary Bonham Carter (dying from cancer) in May 1865, administering his own brand of prayer and kindness. He was a staunch critic of the Poor Laws that condemned the poor, sick, and vulnerable to appalling degradation, leaving people to starve. In London alone in 1866 there were 21,500 patients with no trained nurses. But his influence could be profound. In 1874, he criticised Nightingale&#x27;s impending Report of Land Tenure in India to the extent that it was never published, because she &quot;could lose influence&quot;.

In the midst of other labours, Jowett had been quietly exerting his influence so as to conciliate all shades of liberal opinion, and bring them to bear upon the abolition of the theological test, which was still required for the M.A. and other degrees, as well as for university and college offices. He spoke upon this question at an important meeting in London on 10 June 1864, which laid the ground for the Universities Tests Act 1871. Directly after, as master of Balliol College, he made the college &quot;a sort of heaven on earth&quot;. The liberal reforms to college commenced radical scientific enquiries into the nature of man&#x27;s existence, questioning on the basis of empirical data the meaning of Christianity and its very existence. The shock waves reverberated through the liberal establishment, into the founding of the Labour Party and the New Liberalism of the Great War.
In connection with the Greek professorship, Jowett had undertaken a work on Plato which grew into a complete translation of the &quot;Dialogues&quot; with introductory essays, for which Florence Nightingale&#x27;s criticism was gratefully received. At this he laboured in vacation time for at least ten years. He argued that platonic love between men was devoid of sexual activity, though Walter Pater would later disagree. He showed no interest in offering his own opinion on God or theology in his translations, in several editions, of Plato&#x27;s works. The educated middle-classes were looking for an answer to how Plato could be relevant to Victorians. But his interest in theology had not abated, and his thoughts found an outlet in occasional preaching. The university pulpit, indeed, was closed to him, but several congregations in London delighted in his sermons, and from 1866 until the year of his death he preached annually in Westminster Abbey, where Stanley had become Dean in 1863. Three volumes of selected sermons were published posthumously. The years 1865–70 were occupied with assiduous teaching and writing.

Amongst his pupils at Balliol were men destined to high positions in the state, whose parents had thus shown their confidence in the supposed heretic, and gratitude on this account was added to other motives for his unsparing efforts in tuition. Robert Scott, master of Balliol College, was promoted to the deanery of Rochester in 1870, and Jowett, finally after years of trying, was elected to the vacant mastership by the fellows of Balliol. Jowett attributed this arrangement to his liberal friend Robert Lowe, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke (at that time a member of Gladstone&#x27;s ministry). From the vantage-ground of this long-coveted position, the Plato was published in 1871. It had a great and well-deserved success. While scholars criticized particular renderings (and there were many small errors to be removed in subsequent editions), it was generally agreed that he had succeeded in making Plato an English classic.

From 1866, his authority in Balliol had been paramount, and various reforms in college had been due to his initiative. The opposing minority were now powerless, and the younger fellows who had been his pupils were more inclined to follow him than others would have been. There was no obstacle to the continued exercise of his firm and reasonable will. He still knew the undergraduates individually, and watched their progress with a vigilant eye. His influence in the university was less assured. The pulpit of St Mary&#x27;s, the university church, was no longer closed to him, but the success of Balliol in the schools gave rise to jealousy in other colleges, and old prejudices did not suddenly give way; while a new movement in favour of &quot;the endowment of research&quot; ran counter to his immediate purposes.

Meanwhile, the tutorships in other colleges, and some of the headships also, were being filled with Balliol men, and Jowett&#x27;s former pupils were prominent in both houses of parliament and at the bar. He continued the practice, which he had commenced in 1848, of taking with him a small party of undergraduates in vacation time, and working with them in one of his favourite haunts, at Askrigg in Wensleydale, or Tummel Bridget or later at West Malvern. Included in this list was Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge who became recognised as equal to the great classical scholar Theodor Mommsen. The new hall (1876), the organ there, entirely his gift (1835) and the cricket ground (1889), remain as external monuments of the master&#x27;s activity. Neither business nor the many claims of friendship interrupted literary work. The six or seven weeks of the long vacation, during which he had pupils with him, were mainly employed in writing. The translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;, the revision of Plato, and, above all, the translation of Thucydides many times revised, occupied several years. The edition of the &quot;Republic&quot;, undertaken in 1856, remained unfinished, but was continued with the help of Professor Lewis Campbell.

Other literary plans were not to take effect – an &quot;Essay on the Religions of the World&quot;, a &quot;Commentary on the Gospels&quot;, a &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, a volume on &quot;Moral Ideas&quot;. Such plans were frustrated, not only by his practical avocations, but by his determination to finish what he had begun, and the fastidious self-criticism which it took so long to satisfy. The book on &quot;Morals&quot; might, however, have been written but for the heavy burden of the vice-chancellorship, which he was induced to accept in 1882, by the hope, only partially fulfilled, of securing many improvements for Oxford University. The Vice-Chancellor was &quot;ex officio&quot; a delegate of the Oxford University Press, where he hoped to effect much; and a plan for draining the Thames Valley, which he had now the power of initiating, was one on which his mind had dwelt for many years.

However, one plan that certainly came to fruition to great applause was the co-operation with Florence Nightingale to bring a lecture tour to Oxford for undergraduates training in the agricultural sciences for the Indian Civil Service. It was supported by economist Arnold Toynbee, also at Balliol, and W R Robertson, Principal of Madras Agricultural College. For the first time, Indians would receive a proper education in the technical aspects of forestry and farming.

==Later life and death==

The exhausting labours of the vice-chancellorship were followed by illness (1887); after this he relinquished the hope of producing any great original writing. His literary industry was thenceforth confined to a commentary on the &quot;Republic&quot; of Plato, and some essays on Aristotle which were to have formed a companion volume to the translation of the &quot;Politics&quot;. The essays which should have accompanied the translation of Thucydides were never written. Jowett, who never married, died on 1 October 1893 in Oxford. The funeral was one of the most impressive ever seen in that city. The pall-bearers were seven heads of colleges and the provost of Eton, all old pupils.

Theologian, tutor, university reformer, renowned master of an Oxford college, Jowett&#x27;s best claim to the remembrance of succeeding generations was his greatness as a moral teacher. Many of the most prominent Englishmen of the day were his pupils and owed much of what they were to his precept and example, his penetrative sympathy, his insistent criticism, and his unwearying friendship. Seldom have ideal aims been so steadily pursued with so clear a recognition of practical limitations. &quot;Dear (tho perfidious) Professor&quot; Jowett&#x27;s theological work was transitional; yet has an element of permanence, &quot;Mr Jowett put as much of his genius into Plato as Plato did into Mr Jowett&#x27;, eulogised Florence Nightingale on her old friend.

As has been said of another thinker, he was &quot;one of those deeply religious men who, when crude theological notions are being revised and called in question seek to put new life into theology by wider and more humane ideas.&quot; In earlier life he had been a zealous student of Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel, and to the end he never ceased to cultivate the philosophic spirit; but he had little confidence in metaphysical systems, and sought rather to translate philosophy into the wisdom of life. As a classical scholar, his scorn of littlenesses sometimes led him into the neglect of minutiae, but he had the higher merit of interpreting ideas. A well-known Balliol rhyme about him runs:

Jowett is buried in St Sepulchre&#x27;s Cemetery off Walton Street in Oxford.

<text>The A2W reactor is a naval nuclear reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The A2W designation stands for:
* A = Aircraft carrier platform
* 2 = Second generation core designed by the contractor
* W = Westinghouse was the contracted designer

== History ==
This nuclear reactor was used in the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the . The four propulsion plants on &quot;Enterprise&quot; each contained two reactors, numbered according to the shaft they powered, 1A-1B, 2A-2B, 3A-3B, and 4A-4B. Each propulsion plant was capable of operating on one reactor plant through most of the power range required to propel the ship at speeds in excess of . Both reactors would have been on-line to simultaneously provide maximum ship speed and plane launching capability.

== Design and operation ==
The reactors are pressurized water reactors fueled by highly enriched uranium-235. Light water is used as both neutron-moderator and reactor coolant. Hafnium Control rods are used to control the operation of the reactor. Extracting the rods to a calculated height allows the reactor to reach criticality, the point at which the nuclear fission reactions reach a self-sustaining level. Thereafter, steam flow (from the steam generators) regulates reactor power as explained below. The control rods are &quot;shimmed&quot; in or out to regulate average coolant temperature or lowered to the bottom of the reactor vessel to shut the reactor down — either done in a slow controlled manner or dropped rapidly during what is called a SCRAM to immediately shut the reactor down in an emergency.

Much of the reactor power control during steady-state operation comes as a result of the coolant water&#x27;s negative temperature coefficient. The power of the reactor is determined by the instantaneous rate of fission events that take place in the fuel. As the water heats up, it expands and becomes less dense, which provides fewer molecules per volume to moderate the neutrons, hence fewer neutrons are slowed to the required thermal energies to sustain thermal fission. Conversely, when the coolant water temperature decreases, its density increases and a greater number of neutrons reach the required thermal energy, increasing the number of fissions per unit of time, creating more heat. This has the effect of allowing &quot;steam demand&quot; to control reactor power, requiring little intervention by the Reactor Operator for changes in the power demanded by the ship&#x27;s operations.

The hot water from the reactors is sent, via large pipes, into heat exchangers called steam generators. There the heat from the pressurized, superheated reactor coolant water is transferred, through tube walls, to water being fed into the steam generators from a separate feed system. Once the reactor coolant water has given off its heat in the steam generators, it is returned, via large electric pumps (four per reactor), to the reactors to repeat the cycle.

Saturated steam is channeled from each steam generator to a common header, where the steam is then sent to the main engine, electrical generators, aircraft catapult system, and various auxiliaries. There are two main propulsion turbines, one high pressure turbine and one low pressure turbine, with a moisture separator in place between the two. The Low Pressure main propulsion turbine is double-ended, whereby the steam enters at the center and divides into two streams as it enters the actual turbine wheels, expanding and giving up its energy as it does so, causing the turbine to spin at high speed. The main shaft enters a reduction gear in which the high rotational velocity of the turbine shaft is stepped down to a usable turn rate for propelling the ship. The expended steam from the main engine and other auxiliaries enters condensers to be cooled into liquid water and recycled to the feed system.

<doc id="231268" wikidata="Q931884" url="?curid=231268" title="Epiclesis">
<text>The epiclesis (also spelled epiklesis; from , ) refers to the invocation of one or several gods. In ancient Greek religion, the epiclesis was the epithet used as the surname given to a deity in religious contexts. The term was borrowed into the Christian tradition, where it designates the part of the Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer) by which the priest invokes the Holy Spirit (or the power of God&#x27;s blessing) upon the Eucharistic bread and wine in some Christian churches. In most Eastern Christian traditions, the Epiclesis comes after the Anamnesis (remembrance of Jesus&#x27; words and deeds); in the Western Rite it usually precedes. In the historic practice of the Western Christian Churches, the consecration is effected at the Words of Institution though during the rise of the Liturgical Movement, many denominations introduced an explicit epiclesis in their liturgies.

== Ancient Greece ==
The Ancient Greek term &quot;epíklēsis&quot; (ἐπίκλησις; literally &#x27;calling upon&#x27;) can be translated as &#x27;surname, additional name&#x27;, or as &#x27;invocation, appeal&#x27;.

In ancient Greek religion, the epiclesis was used as the surname that was associated with a deity during religious invocations, in contrast to the more general term &#x27;epithet&#x27; (ἐπίθετον), which is used in poetic contexts. In the 2nd century AD, the Greek geographer Pausanias used the term &#x27;epiclesis&#x27; to designate the appellation under which a deity was honoured in specific places or occasions.

== Christianity ==

===Eastern churches===
In 2001, in the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity on admission to the Eucharist between Chaldean Catholic Church and Assyrian Church of the East issued a statement stating that the Words of Institution are dispersed euchologically in Liturgy of Addai and Mari, wherein the words are stated not in immediate sequence but throughout the Liturgy. The Eastern Orthodox Churches hold the Epiclesis to be the moment at which this change is completed. However, the actual process of change is not considered to begin at this moment, but begins with the Liturgy of Preparation—it is merely completed at the Epiclesis.

In the 20th century, when Western Rite Orthodox parishes began to be established, liturgies were derived from Catholic Latin liturgical rites and Anglican &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. These liturgies saw a &quot;stronger&quot; Epiclesis inserted, as to better align them with the Byzantine liturgy.

====Liturgy of St. Cyril (and Alexandrian-type Anaphoras)====
Liturgy of St. Cyril (also known as Egyptian Liturgy of St. Mark) typically after the post-sanctus prayer, the structure is usually as follows: Epiclesis I—Institution Narrative—Anamnesis—Epiclesis II. Since these group of liturgies contain the earliest full anaphoras available to us, they have become incredibly important in understanding the development of liturgical prayers. The epicleses of these anaphora are seen as consecratory; however, recent papers have shown that the liturgical thought of Egypt was less focused on a specific moment of consecration, being more process-focused in terms of Eucharistic Consecration.

====Liturgy of Addai and Mari====
In its pure form, the ancient anaphora of the Liturgy of Addai and Mari used in the Church of the East (East Syriac Rite) does include an epiclesis. It does not use the Words of Institution, although they appear directly and indirectly in other parts of the rite (and is therefore considered to be implicit).

:&quot;Priest:&quot; We too, my Lord, your feeble, unworthy, and miserable servants who are gathered in your name and stand before you at this hour, and have received by tradition the example which is from you, while rejoicing, glorifying, exalting, and commemorating, perform this great, fearful, holy, life-giving, and divine Mystery of the passion, death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

:And may there come, O my Lord, your Holy Spirit, and may he rest upon this oblation of your servants. May he bless it and hallow it, and may it be for us, O my Lord, for the pardon of debts, the forgiveness of sins, the great hope of resurrection from the dead, and for new life in the kingdom of heaven with all who have been well-pleasing before you. And for all this great and marvelous dispensation towards us we will give thanks to you and praise you without ceasing in your church, which is saved by the precious blood of your Christ.

====Liturgy of St. James====
In the Liturgy of Saint James, according to the form in which it is celebrated on the island of Zakynthos, Greece, the anaphora is as follows:

:&quot;Priest (aloud):&quot; Thy people and Thy Church entreat Thee. &quot;(thrice)&quot;

:&quot;People:&quot; Have mercy on us, Lord God, the Father, the Almighty. &quot;(thrice)&quot;

:&quot;The Priest, in a low voice:&quot; Have mercy on us, Lord God, the Father, the Almighty. Have mercy on us, God our Saviour. Have mercy on us, O God, in accordance with Thy great mercy, and send forth upon these holy gifts, here set forth, Thine all-holy Spirit, &quot;(bowing)&quot; the Lord and giver of life, enthroned with Thee, God and Father, and Thine only-begotten Son, co-reigning, consubstantial and co-eternal, who spoke by the Law and the Prophets and by Thy New Covenant, who came down in the form of a dove upon our Lord Jesus Christ in the river Jordan, and rested upon him, who came down upon Thy holy Apostles in the form of fiery tongues in the upper room of holy and glorious Sion on the day of Pentecost. &quot;(Standing up)&quot; Thy same all-holy Spirit, Lord, send down on us and on these gifts here set forth,

:&quot;(aloud):&quot; that having come by his holy, good and glorious presence, He may sanctify this bread and make it the holy Body of Christ,

:&quot;People:&quot; Amen.

:&quot;Priest:&quot; and this Cup (chalice) the precious Blood of Christ,

:&quot;People:&quot; Amen.

:&quot;The Priest signs the holy Gifts and says in a low voice:&quot; that they may become for all those who partake of them for forgiveness of sins and everlasting life. For sanctification of souls and bodies. For a fruitful harvest of good works. For the strengthening of Thy holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, which Thou didst found on the rock of the faith, so that the gates of Hell might not prevail against it, delivering it from every heresy and from the scandals caused by those who work iniquity, and from the enemies who arise and attack it, until the consummation of the age.

====Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom====
In the Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom an epiclesis is present (explicit); the priest says:

:&quot;Priest:&quot; Again we offer to Thee this spiritual and bloodless worship; and we beg Thee, we ask Thee, we pray Thee: Send down Thy Holy Spirit upon us and upon these Gifts set forth.
:&quot;Priest:&quot; God Cleanse me a sinner and have mercy on me(3)
:&quot;Priest&quot;: O Lord, Who didst send down Thy most Holy Spirit at the third hour on Thy apostles, take Him not from us O Good One, but renew Him in us who pray unto Thee
:(&quot;Deacon:&quot; Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me)
:&quot;Priest&quot;: O Lord, Who didst send down Thy most Holy Spirit at the third hour on Thy apostles, take Him not from us O Good One, but renew Him in us who pray unto Thee
:(&quot;Deacon:&quot; Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me)
:&quot;Priest&quot;: O Lord, Who didst send down Thy most Holy Spirit at the third hour on Thy apostles, take Him not from us O Good One, but renew Him in us who pray unto Thee
:(&quot;Deacon [pointing with his orarion to the diskos]:&quot; Bless, Master, the Holy Bread.)
:&quot;Priest:&quot; Make this bread the Precious Body of Thy Christ,
:(&quot;Deacon [pointing to the chalice]:&quot; Amen. Bless, Master, the Holy Cup.)
:&quot;Priest:&quot; And that which is in this Cup, the Precious Blood of Thy Christ,
:(&quot;Deacon [pointing to both]:&quot; Amen. Bless them both, Master.)
:&quot;Priest:&quot; Changing them by Thy Holy Spirit.
:(&quot;Deacon:&quot; Amen, Amen, Amen.)

====Liturgy of St. Basil the Great====
In the Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great according to the Greek recension of the prayers, the liturgical actions described above for the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom are the same. The formula is as follows:

:&quot;Priest:&quot; Therefore, O Most-holy Master we sinners and Thine unworthy servants also, having been vouchsafed to minister at Thy holy Altar, not because of our righteousness, for we have not done that which is good on the earth, but because of Thy mercies and Thy compassions, which Thou hast poured out richly upon us, dare to draw nigh unto Thy holy Altar; and having presented the sacred emblems of the Body and Blood of Thy Christ, we pray Thee, and we call upon Thee: O Holy of Holies, through the favour of Thy goodness send Thy Holy Spirit down upon us, and upon these Gifts presented here, and bless them, sanctify, and manifest them.
:(&quot;Deacon [pointing with his orarion to the diskos]:&quot; Bless, Master, the Holy Bread.)
:&quot;Priest:&quot; And make this Bread itself the precious Body of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
:(&quot;Deacon [pointing to the chalice:&quot; Amen. Bless, Master, the Holy Cup.)
:&quot;Priest:&quot; And that which is in this Cup, the precious Blood itself of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
:(&quot;Deacon [pointing to both]:&quot; Amen. Bless them both, Master.)
:&quot;Priest:&quot; Which was shed for the life of the world, and for its salvation.
:(&quot;Deacon:&quot; Amen)
:&quot;Priest:&quot; Changing them by Thy Holy Spirit.
:(&quot;Deacon:&quot; Amen, Amen, Amen.)

===Roman Rite===

In the Catholic Church, the Words of Institution are considered to be the moment of Transubstantiation (when, according to religious tradition, the eucharistic elements would change from bread and wine into the actual Body and Blood of Christ).
The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; teaches that &quot;The Epiclesis (&quot;invocation upon&quot;) is the intercession in which the priest begs the Father to send the Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier, so that the offerings may become the body and blood of Christ and that the faithful by receiving them, may themselves become a living offering to God.&quot; Still later it asserts, &quot;At the heart of the Eucharistic celebration are the bread and wine that, by the words of Christ and the invocation of the Holy Spirit, become Christ&#x27;s Body and Blood.&quot;

====Implicit epicleses====
In the 1962 Roman Missal, the prayer &quot;Quam oblationem&quot; of the Roman Canon has been interpreted as an &quot;implicit&quot; epiclesis. Josef Jungmann supported this view that the &quot;Quam oblationem&quot; &quot;is a plea for the final hallowing of the earthly gift.&quot;
:Be pleased, O God, we pray,
:to bless, acknowledge,
:and approve this offering in every respect;
:make it spiritual and acceptable,
:so that it may become for us
:the Body and Blood of your most beloved Son,
:our Lord Jesus Christ.

In the 1962 Canon, the priest begins the &quot;Quam oblation&quot; with hands folded, opens them placing his left hand on his chest and then makes three are large signs of the cross with his extended right hand over both bread and wine as indicated by &quot;+&quot; in between the words benedictam (blessed), adscriptam (approved), ratam (ratified), below. The fourth sign of the cross is made over the bread and the fifth over the wine at the words Corpus and Sanguis, respectively. The prayer is immediately followed by the Institution Narrative with the words of Jesus Christ.
:Quam oblationem tu, Deus, in omnibus, quæsumus, 
:bene + dictam, 
:adscrip + tam, 
:ra + tam, rationabilem, acceptabilemque facere digneris: 
:ut nobis 
:Cor + pus 
:et San + guis 
:fiat dilectissimi Filii tui, Domini nostri Iesu Christi.

Nicholas Cabasilas, a 14th-century Eastern Orthodox writer, held that the Roman Canon did not solely consecrate via the Words of Institution–which was typically identified as the consecratory element by contemporaneous Latin theologians–but instead retained an implicit epiclesis in the &quot;Supplices te rogamus&quot; that was the consecratory element. Responding to Latin criticisms of Greek emphasis on the epiclesis, Cabasilas asserted the epiclesis as a necessary component of Eucharistic consecration. However, Cabasilas clarified that the epiclesis and Words of Institution are interdependent in order to create an effectual anaphora. Ultimately, Cabasilas assessed that while some Latin liturgical practices appeared errant, the Latin doctrine of the Eucharist was identical to that Eastern Orthodox and that there was a mostly shared ritual practice. At the Council of Florence, Cabasilas&#x27;s necessity of the epiclesis was challenged and ultimately rejected by Latin theologians; modern Catholic teaching is generally more receptive of Cabasilas. As a result, Cabasilas&#x27;s work remains a frequent point of discussion in ecumenical dialogues.&quot;

In Western Rite Orthodox parishes, an epiclesis, modified from that of the Byzantine Rite Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, is inserted into the Roman Canon, immediately before the &quot;Supplices&quot;. The addition of an epiclesis was originally suggested by Joseph Overbeck, the first person to make serious petitions for the restoration of an Orthodox western rite. This opinion on the need of an epiclesis was shared by the Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, who added an epiclesis to the modified book of common prayer, later known as the Divine Liturgy of St. Tikhon. When the Gregorian Liturgy was approved for use in 1961, the Overbeck missal was approved for use, including the epicleses. This epiclesis shares most of its text with that of the Liturgy of St. John, but with certain omissions, streamlining it better into the canon.

:And we beseech, Thee, O Lord, to send down Thy Holy Spirit upon (us and upon) these offerings, 
:that He would make this bread the precious body of Thy Christ, 
:and that which is in this cup, 
:the precious blood of Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.

Many variances exist in the exact text of the epiclesis, due to translation inconsistency and different schools of thought on how the modified canon should be handled (e.g. should the elevation of the host and chalice remain?)

Still another possible implicit epiclesis of the Roman Liturgy is the &quot;Veni, Sanctificator&quot; which, however, is one of the 1962 Missal&#x27;s offertory prayers and is not part of the Roman Canon:
:Come, Thou, the Sanctifier,
:God, almighty and everlasting:
:bless this sacrifice
:which is prepared for the glory of Thy holy name.
Moreover, this prayer is not included in the 1970 Roman Missal.

====Explicit epicleses====
The additional Eucharistic Prayers (EP) introduced into the Roman Rite in the 1969 revision have both a pre-consecration and a post-consecration epiclesis.

Pre-consecration
:Eucharistic Prayer II: Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray
::by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,
::so that they may become for us
::the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.

:Eucharistic Prayer III: Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you
::by the same Spirit graciously make holy
::these gifts we have brought to you for consecration,
::that they may become the Body and Blood
::of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
::at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.

:Eucharistic Prayer IV: Therefore, O Lord, we pray:
::may this same Holy Spirit
::graciously sanctify these offerings,
::that they may become
::the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
::for the celebration of this great mystery
::which he himself left us
::as an eternal covenant.

Post-consecration
:Eucharistic Prayer II: Humbly we pray,
::that, partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ
::we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.

:Eucharistic Prayer III: Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church
::and, recognising the sacrificial Victim by whose death
::you willed to reconcile us to yourself,
::grant that we, who are nourished
::by the Body and Blood of your Son
::and filled with his Holy Spirit,
::may become one body, one spirit in Christ.

:Eucharistic Prayer IV: Look, O Lord, upon the Sacrifice
::which you yourself have provided for your Church,
::and grant in your loving kindness
::to all who partake of this one Bread and one Chalice
::that, gathered into one body by the Holy Spirit,
::they may truly become a living sacrifice in Christ
::to the praise of your glory.

===Protestantism===
====Lutheranism and Anglicanism====
Lutheran and Anglican divines have argued that in earlier liturgies of theirs in which an Epiclesis and unity with the one sacrifice of Christ may not have seemed explicit (as with the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;), it was stated as the point of the consecration in other parts of the rite, notably in required exhortations (the Words of Institution).

In present-day practice, Anglicans in the USA and American Lutheran Eucharistic prayers and newer Old Catholic anaphoras, tend to follow the Eastern practice of treating the Words of Institution as a warrant for the action, with the Epiclesis following the anamnesis/oblation. For example, after the Words of Institution, the epiclesis in Eucharistic Prayer B in the American Book of Common Prayer (which is found in the Canadian &quot;Book of Alternative Service&quot; and several other Anglican liturgies) reads:

:&quot;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of All,
:presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.
:We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts
:that they may be + the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant.
:Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him,
:being + sanctified by the Holy Spirit.&quot;

After the Words of Institution in the Lutheran Book of Worship, for example, the epiclesis in Eucharistic Prayer III reads:

:&quot;And we implore you
:mercifully to accept our praise and thanksgiving
:and, with your Word and Holy Spirit,
:to bless us, your servants,
:and these your own gifts of bread and wine;
:that we and all who share in the + body and blood of your Son
:may be filled with Heavenly peace and joy
:and, receiving the forgiveness of sin,
:may be + sanctified in soul and body,
:and have our portion with all your saints.&quot;

====Methodism====
&quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists&quot;, the first Methodistic liturgical text, saw the &quot;words of institution as the main consecratory act&quot;. The Wesleys &quot;introduced the &quot;epiclesis&quot; in their eucharistic hymns&quot;; as such, early Methodists sung a hymnic epiclesis from &quot;Hymns of the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; (&quot;HLS&quot;) after the Words of Institution. According to a 2003 report of the British Methodist Church, &quot;His Presence Makes The Feast: Holy Communion in the Methodist Church&quot;: &quot;The one Spirit by whom we are all baptised into the one body (1 Corinthians 12:13) is the same Spirit who unites us in and with the body of Christ in Holy Communion. The Holy Spirit at work in the Church of the Acts of the Apostles brings into effect a witnessing and preaching community in which there is apostolic teaching, fellowship, prayer and the breaking of the bread (Acts 2:42).&quot; The epiclesis of the present-day liturgy in many Methodist connexions draws from both the Anglican tradition, such as the 1549 Prayer Book, and the liturgical renewal movement of the 20th century that focused upon liturgies of the ancient church, such as the early rite of Hippolytus. From these traditions, John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, inherited the notion that the Holy Spirit was to be invoked to make real and true all that God had promised to bestow on the faithful through Holy Communion. This theology of epiclesis is evidenced in several Methodist hymns written by Charles Wesley, the brother of John Wesley.
The epiclesis used in The United Methodist Church is as follows:

:&quot;Pour out your Holy Spirit on us gathered here,
:and on these gifts of bread and wine.
:Make them be for us the body and blood of Christ,
:that we may be for the world the body of Christ,
:redeemed by his blood.
:By your Spirit make us one with Christ,
:one with each other...&quot; (&quot;UMH&quot;; pages 10, 14).

The traditional rite of Holy Communion used before the publication of the 1989 hymnal did not include an explicit epiclesis. The traditional text, with slight revisions, is Word and Table IV, and it contains a 16 word, two line epiclesis, as follows:

:&quot;bless and sanctify with thy Word and Holy Spirit
:these thy gifts of bread and wine&quot; (&quot;UMH&quot;, page 29.)

Another epiclesis used in the Methodist Church in Great Britain is as follows: 
:&quot;Send down your Holy Spirit
:that these gifts of bread and wine
:may be for us the body and blood of Christ.
:Unite us with him for ever
:and bring us with the whole creation
:to your eternal kingdom.&quot;

==== Reformed (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist) ====

Reformed churches generally hold a spiritual presence (pneumatic presence) view of communion. The Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist traditions of Reformed Christianity resisted the imposition of particular prayers like those found in the Book of Common Prayer, producing alternative guidelines like the Directory for Public Worship. Nevertheless, ministers in these churches may make use of common liturgical prayers, including the epiclesis, that follow the same ecumenical shape as in other traditions.

The epiclesis found in the Book of Common Worship (PCUSA) reads:Gracious God, &lt;br&gt;pour out your Holy Spirit upon us &lt;br&gt;and upon these your gifts of bread and wine, &lt;br&gt;that the bread we break &lt;br&gt;and the cup we bless &lt;br&gt;may be the communion of the body and blood of Christ.&lt;br&gt;By your Spirit make us one with Christ, &lt;br&gt;that we may be one with all who share this feast, &lt;br&gt;united in ministry in every place. &lt;br&gt;As this bread is Christ’s body for us, &lt;br&gt;send us out to be the body of Christ in the world.

In the Christian Reformed Church:Lord, our God, send your Holy Spirit upon us,&lt;br&gt;that all who eat and drink at this table&lt;br&gt;may be one body and one holy people,&lt;br&gt;a living sacrifice to the glory of Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;in whose name we pray. Amen.

===Use in other sacraments===
A similar invocation of the Holy Spirit by the priest in some other sacraments is also called an epiclesis. The Eastern Orthodox Church holds that such an epiclesis is necessary for the validity of the Holy Mystery (sacrament) of marriage; the Roman Catholic Church holds that it is not, since for them the bride and groom are the ministers of that sacrament.

An epiclesis also appears in the Orthodox rite of Baptism. Baptism in the Roman Rite includes an epiclesis as part of the blessing of the baptismal water:
::&quot;We ask you, Father, with your Son to send the Holy Spirit upon the water of this font. May all who are buried with Christ in the death of baptism rise also with him to newness of life. We ask this through Christ our Lord.&quot;

In the Roman Rite sacrament of Confirmation, the bishop invokes the Holy Spirit upon those being confirmed:
::&quot;Send your Holy Spirit upon them to be their Helper and Guide.&quot;

Other epicleses include that in the Eastern Orthodox Great Blessing of Waters on the feast of the Theophany.

<text>Halberstadt was a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the middle of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from north clockwise) Bördekreis, Quedlinburg, 
Wernigerode, Goslar, 
Wolfenbüttel, Helmstedt.

== History ==
The region around Halberstadt was a clerical principality, which emerged with the creation of the Bishopric of Halberstadt in 804 and existed until the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1648 it was secularized and became part of Brandenburg-Prussia as the Principality of Halberstadt. During the Napoleonic Wars it became part of the French-controlled Kingdom of Westphalia, where Halberstadt was the capital of the Département of the Saale. In 1815 it came back to the Kingdom of Prussia, and in 1816 it became part of the &quot;Regierungsbezirk Magdeburg&quot; within the newly established Prussian Province of Saxony. At the same time the &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) of Halberstadt was created. In 1825 it was merged with the Osterwieck district.

On 1 July 2007 the district was merged with the districts of Quedlinburg and Wernigerode to form the new district of Harz.

== Geography ==
The district is located at the northern end of the Harz mountains.

Campbell was born in Edinburgh. His father, Robert Campbell, RN, was a first cousin of Thomas Campbell, the poet. His mother was the author Eliza Constantia Campbell. His father died when he was two years of age. In 1844 his mother married Col. Hugh Morrieson.

Campbell was educated at Edinburgh Academy, the University of Glasgow, Trinity College, Oxford and Balliol College, Oxford. He was fellow and tutor of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford (1855–1858), vicar of Milford, Hampshire (1858–1863), and professor of Greek at the University of St Andrews (1863–1894). An advocate for the higher education for women, he was closely involved in the foundation of St Leonards School for Girls and was the chairman of the school council from 1886 to 1903. In 1894, he was elected an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. From 1894 to 1896 at St Andrews, he gave the Gifford Lectures, which were published in 1898.

An Anglican vicar, in October 1893 Campbell was reportedly preaching at the University of St Andrews&#x27; College Church which maintains links with the Scottish Episcopalian denomination.

==Works==
As a scholar he is best known by his work on Sophocles and Plato. His published works include:
*&quot;Sophocles&quot; Greek text with English notes in two volumes (2nd ed., 1879)
*&quot;The Sophistes and Politicus of Plato&quot; Greek text with English notes (1867)
* &quot;Sophocles, The Seven Plays in English Verse&quot; (1883)
*&quot;The Theaetetus of Plato&quot; Greek text with English notes (2nd ed., 1883)
*&quot;Republic&quot;, the Greek text, in three volumes (with Benjamin Jowett, 1894)
*&quot;Life and Letters of Benjamin Jowett&quot; in two volumes (with Evelyn Abbott, 1897)
*&quot;Letters of B. Jowett&quot; (1899)
*&quot;Life of James Clerk Maxwell&quot;, with William Garnett, 1st ed., 1882, (new ed. revised and abridged, 1884)
*&quot;A Guide to Greek Tragedy for English Readers&quot; (1891)
* (Gifford Lectures for 1894–1896)
*&quot;On the Nationalisation of the Old English Universities&quot; (1901)
*&quot;Verse translations of the plays of Aeschylus&quot; (1890)
*&quot;Sophocles&quot; (1896)
*&quot;Plato&#x27;s Republic&quot; Oxford lectures (1902)
*&quot;Tragic Drama in Aeschylus, Sophocles and Shakespeare&quot; (1904)
*&quot;Paralipomena Sophoclea&quot; (1907).

Sir W.D. Ross had recognized the importance of stylometric methods in Plato chronology which Campbell had introduced in his editions of the Sophistes and Politicus of 1869. Recent scholars such as Charles H. Kahn and Diskin Clay, have each advanced the ordering and grouping of Plato&#x27;s dialogues according to the same method.

<doc id="231281" wikidata="Q892438" url="?curid=231281" title="Ironside (1967 TV series)">
<text>Ironside is an American television crime drama that aired on NBC over eight seasons from 1967 to 1975. The show starred Raymond Burr as Robert T. Ironside (usually addressed by the title &quot;Chief Ironside&quot;), a consultant to the San Francisco police department (formerly chief of detectives), who was paralyzed from the waist down after being shot while on vacation. The character debuted on March 28, 1967, in a TV movie titled &quot;Ironside&quot;. When the series was broadcast in the United Kingdom, from late 1967 onward, it was broadcast as &quot;A Man Called Ironside&quot;. The show earned Burr six Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations.

&quot;Ironside&quot; was a production of Burr&#x27;s Harbour Productions Unlimited in association with Universal Television.

== Plot ==
The series revolves around former San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Chief of Detectives Robert T. Ironside (Raymond Burr), a Navy veteran, widower, and veteran of 25 years of police service, forced to retire from the department after a sniper&#x27;s bullet to the spine paralyzed him from the waist down, resulting in his reliance on a wheelchair. In the pilot episode, a television movie, Ironside shows his strength of character and gets himself appointed a peculiar and unprecedented job; a &quot;special department consultant&quot;, by his good friend, Police Commissioner Dennis Randall. He does this by calling a press conference and then tricking Commissioner Randall into meeting his terms. In the pilot, Ironside eventually solves the mystery of the ambush. He requests Ed Brown and Eve Whitfield be assigned to him as his own private law enforcement squad.

Supporting characters on &quot;Ironside&quot; included Det. Sgt. Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Brown (Don Galloway) and a young socialite-turned-plainclothes officer, Eve Whitfield (Barbara Anderson). In addition, delinquent-turned assistant Mark Sanger (Don Mitchell), who subsequently attends and graduates from law school (night classes were mentioned from early on), joins the San Francisco police force himself in the sixth season, then marries late in the run of the series. Commissioner Randall was played by Gene Lyons.

After the program&#x27;s fourth season, Anderson left for personal reasons, and her character was then replaced by another young policewoman, Fran Belding (Elizabeth Baur), who filled much the same role for four more years.

Ironside uses a fourth-floor room (for living and office space) in the old San Francisco Hall of Justice building, which housed the city&#x27;s police headquarters. He recruits Mark Sanger to be his personal assistant after Sanger is brought in as a suspect who wanted to kill Ironside. Ironside acquires a specially equipped, former fleet-modified 1940 -ton Ford police patrol wagon, with bulletproof glass and a specially modified high-performance supercharged and fuel-injected V-8 engine. This is replaced in the episode titled &quot;Poole&#x27;s Paradise&quot; after the van is destroyed by Sergeant Brown as part of a plan to trick a corrupt sheriff. At the end of the episode, the patrol wagon is replaced by a one-off fully custom modified 1969 one-ton Ford Econoline Window Van.

The show became a success as Ironside depended on brains and initiative in solving cases. Although Ironside is portrayed as good-hearted and honest, he maintains a gruff persona. The series enjoyed a seven-and-a-half-season run on NBC, drawing respectable, if not always high ratings. As the shortened eighth and final season began (only 16 of 19 episodes produced were aired by NBC), Universal released a syndicated rerun package of episodes from earlier seasons under the title &quot;The Raymond Burr Show&quot;, reflecting the practice of that time to differentiate original network episodes from syndicated reruns whenever possible. After NBC&#x27;s midseason cancellation, however, the syndicated episodes reverted to the &quot;Ironside&quot; title.

== Cast ==
* Raymond Burr as Chief Robert T. Ironside
* Don Galloway as Detective Sergeant Ed Brown
* Barbara Anderson as Officer Eve Whitfield
* Don Mitchell as (later Officer) Mark Sanger
* Elizabeth Baur as Officer Fran Belding
* Gene Lyons as Commissioner Dennis Randall (recurring role)

== Production ==
=== Locations ===
The show was filmed in a mixture of locations, sometimes in San Francisco, but also with a large number of studio scenes (including scenes with conversations in a moving vehicle, where a traffic backdrop is used). The shows contained stock footage of San Francisco, with pan shots of Coit Tower or clips of traffic scenes.

Ironside and his team used a rather large open space on the fourth floor of the Old Hall of Justice in San Francisco at 750 Kearny Street between Washington and Merchant Streets. The Old Hall had already been demolished while &quot;Ironside &quot;was still in production. It had been abandoned in 1961 and demolished in late 1967. The SFPD had begun using their new home by January 1962. In December 1967, demolition finally began. Wrecking balls and bulldozers took five months to raze the building.

=== Music ===
The opening theme music was composed by Quincy Jones, and was the first synthesizer-based television theme song. In 1971, Jones recorded a fuller four-minute band version for the album &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot;. This recording was then edited and used for the opening credits of the fifth through eighth seasons (1971–1975). (The entire album track can be heard in the fifth-season episode &quot;Unreasonable Facsimile&quot; as Ironside and team track a suspect on the streets of San Francisco.) The iconic theme music has since been sampled in numerous recordings and soundtracks to television commercials and shows, including &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot;. The score for the episode &quot;The Macabre Mr. Micawber&quot; by Billy Goldenberg (credited as William Goldenberg) was sampled for the song &quot;All Caps&quot; by the hip-hop duo Madvillain.

In addition to the opening theme music, Quincy Jones composed the entire score for the first eight episodes. Oliver Nelson took over those duties up to the end of the winter to spring 1972 episodes. Nelson was then replaced by Marty Paich for nearly all of the episodes from the beginning of the fall of that year until the last episode that was produced, in late 1974. The song &quot;Even When You Cry&quot;, with music composed by Jones and lyrics written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman, was performed by James Farentino in the episode &quot;Something for Nothing&quot;, while Marcia Strassman had already sung it off-screen in the earlier episode &quot;The Man Who Believed&quot;; both installments were originally broadcast during season one.

===Personnel===

*Freddie Hubbard − trumpet
*Frank Rosolino − trombone
*Hubert Laws − flute
*Anthony Ortega, Jerome Richardson, Dan Higgins − reeds
*Howard Roberts, Bill Pitman − guitar
*Carol Kaye − electric bass
*Shelly Manne, Earl Palmer − drums

== Episodes ==
=== Episode list ===

* The pilot episode was titled &quot;A Man Called Ironside&quot;.
** The last three episodes of the series were not broadcast on NBC, but were later seen in syndication, as well as released on DVD.

=== TV reunion movie ===
Burr and the main cast reunited for a made-for-TV movie in 1993, &quot;The Return of Ironside&quot;, which aired on May 4, 1993, on NBC, not long before Burr&#x27;s death. At the time, Burr was starring in a series of telefilms for NBC playing his most famous character, Perry Mason. In the years between the end of &quot;Ironside&quot; in 1975 and the first &quot;Perry Mason&quot; movie in 1985, Burr&#x27;s appearance had undergone some changes. His hair was grayer, he had gained a significant amount of weight, and after years of playing clean-shaven characters, he grew a beard.

Since nearly 20 years had passed since &quot;Ironside&quot; left the air, and as he had been playing Perry Mason on television for the previous eight years, Burr felt that he was more associated with Perry Mason. He believed that to play Ironside properly and not confuse viewers, he would need to undergo a small makeover to distinguish the Ironside character from the more identifiable Perry Mason. Burr thus had his hair colored (which was unnecessary, since Burr was already gray-haired when &quot;Ironside&quot; originally aired) and cut his beard down to a goatee. One thing Burr did not need to do, however, was pretend to be disabled. At the time the &quot;Ironside&quot; reunion went into production, Burr had been suffering from kidney cancer that had metastasized to his liver, and the disease left him unable to stand or walk without assistance. Thus, like Ironside, Burr used a wheelchair to get around.

Unlike the original series, which took place in San Francisco, the reunion was set and filmed in Denver, Colorado, with the justification that the character Ed Brown had become the city&#x27;s deputy chief of police. (Denver was also where most of Burr&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV movies were produced.) Galloway, Mitchell, Anderson, and Baur recreated their roles for the movie, though Anderson and Baur had not worked at the same time on the original series.

== Broadcast history ==
== Notable guest appearances ==
== Crossovers and spinoffs ==
At the start of its sixth season, &quot;Ironside&quot; did a two-part crossover episode with &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors&quot;, titled &quot;Five Days in the Death of Sergeant Brown&quot;, where Ed is critically injured by a sniper and is treated by Dr. David Craig and his medical staff. Part 1 was broadcast on &quot;Ironside&quot; and part two on &quot;The New Doctors&quot;. Part two is now shown in reruns as an episode of &quot;Ironside&quot;. E. G. Marshall and David Hartman (stars of &quot;The New Doctors&quot;) received starring credit in the opening credits of both episodes. Part two features a longer edited version of Quincy Jones&#x27; &quot;Ironside&quot; theme as heard on his 1971 album &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot;.

NBC&#x27;s 1971 fall TV season opened with a two-hour crossover between &quot;Ironside&quot; and a new series, &quot;Sarge&quot;, starring George Kennedy as a cop-turned-priest. Kennedy&#x27;s San Diego–based Father Samuel Cavanaugh comes to San Francisco because of the death of a friend and fellow priest, and his investigation gets him embroiled with Ironside and his staff. The special consolidated the two shows&#x27; consecutive time slots and has been subsequently seen as a TV-movie, &quot;The Priest Killer&quot;.

Jessica Walter guest-starred in a spin-off episode for the series &quot;Amy Prentiss&quot;, which aired as part of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; during the 1974–1975 season. She played a relatively young investigator who becomes chief of detectives for the San Francisco Police Department. Helen Hunt, in an early role, played Prentiss&#x27; preteen daughter, Jill. Three two-hour episodes were aired.

The 22nd episode of season seven, airing in March 1974, and titled &quot;Riddle at 24,000,&quot; was a pilot for &quot;Dr. Domingo,&quot; a proposed spin-off series starring Desi Arnaz as a crime-solving physician in a small, California town. It was written by Lane Slate, perhaps best known as the screenwriter of &quot;They Only Kill Their Masters&quot;, the James Garner movie about a small-town police chief. 
== 2013 remake ==

In 2013, a short-lived remake with the same name aired on NBC. Actor Blair Underwood took on the title role (with none of the other characters from the original series being used), while the action was relocated from San Francisco to New York City. This version of the character was more in the tough cop mold, often at odds with his superiors over his unrelenting, even violent approach to police work. The series was lambasted by critics and ignored by viewers, and was cancelled and pulled after the airing of just four episodes (of nine produced).

== Other media ==
There was a single novel based on the series by Jim Thompson. It was published in 1967 by Popular Library.

There was also a board game published by Ideal in 1967.

== Parodies ==
An episode of &quot;Get Smart&quot; that aired in March 1969 was titled &quot;Leadside&quot; and featured a wheelchair-using master criminal by that name (and his assistants). Leadside could not walk, but he was able to run. 
Leadside was directed by Gary Nelson. Nelson never directed on &quot;Ironside&quot; during its original stint as a television series but instead directed the reunion television movie &quot;The Return of Ironside&quot;.

Another &quot;Get Smart&quot; episode, called &quot;Ironhand,&quot; had a KAOS operative with a hand encased in metal hence why he was known as Ironhand.

The December 1970 issue of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine included a parody of &quot;Ironside&quot; titled &quot;Ironride.&quot;

On &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, Benny Hill played Ironside in a few sketches, most notably in a sketch called &quot;Murder on the Oregon Express,&quot; which parodied several television detective characters.

Impressionist Billy Howard included Ironside as one of the detectives parodied in his novelty hit record &quot;King of the Cops.&quot;

The 1980 television movie &quot;Murder Can Hurt You&quot; spoofs numerous television detectives from the 1970s and &#x27;80s, and includes Victor Buono playing the wheelchair-using detective Ironbottom.

&quot;American Dad&quot; has an episode, &quot;Wheels and Legman,&quot; that loosely parodies &quot;Ironside&quot; and similar programs in which Roger and Steve have a fictional detective agency.

In the &quot;Gone Efficient&quot; episode of &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, a man in a wheelchair is shown pleading a case in front of Judge Mentok (who strongly resembles Raymond Burr) as a nod to both &quot;Ironside&quot; and &quot;Perry Mason&quot;.

A promo for the adult animated sitcom &quot;Archer&quot; was made in the style of the show&#x27;s opening sequence, replacing Ironside with the character Ray Gillette, who had been temporary confined to a wheelchair after a spinal injury.

<text>Edwin Cole McCain (born January 20, 1970) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. His songs &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot; (1998) and &quot;I Could Not Ask for More&quot; (1999) were radio top-40 hits in the U.S., and five of his albums have reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. McCain has released eleven albums.

==Early life==
McCain graduated from Christ Church Episcopal School in Greenville, South Carolina, and briefly attended both the College of Charleston and Coastal Carolina University. 

==Career==
In 1994, McCain recorded his first major-label album, &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot; under the Lava Records imprint. The record was released in 1995. His second album, &quot;Misguided Roses&quot;, spawned &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot;, a major hit single in 1998. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot; also is featured on the charitable album, &quot;Live in the X Lounge&quot;, along with a live version of McCain&#x27;s &quot;Solitude&quot;. 

The summer of 1999 marked the arrival of McCain&#x27;s third album, &quot;Messenger&quot;, which included a second Top 40 hit, the Diane Warren-penned &quot;I Could Not Ask For More.&quot; &quot;I Could Not Ask For More&quot; was also featured on the soundtrack for the 1999 film &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;.

In 2002, McCain released his first DVD, &quot;Mile Marker: Songs and Stories from the Acoustic Highway&quot;. In 2003, he released a collection of acoustic versions of old and new songs called &quot;The Austin Sessions&quot;. About the same time, he hosted &quot;Inside Music With Edwin McCain&quot;, a syndicated show on the Sirius radio network. Mid-2004 saw the arrival of McCain&#x27;s studio album &quot;Scream &amp; Whisper&quot;. In late 2004, McCain released his second DVD, &quot;Tinsel and Tap Shoes&quot;. It was his first live concert DVD, recorded at The House of Blues in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

In 2005, McCain released a single, &quot;Hold Out a Hand,&quot; co-written and performed with singer/songwriter Maia Sharp. All profits from the single went to hurricane relief. McCain&#x27;s next album, &quot;Lost in America,&quot; was released on April 11, 2006. &quot;Lost in America&quot; contained three singles: &quot;Truly Believe&quot;, &quot;The Kiss&quot; and live-favorite &quot;Gramercy Park Hotel&quot;, which pays homage to the New York City landmark and its colorful patrons. A subsequent recording, a collection of R&amp;B cover songs titled &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault But Mine&quot;, was produced by Tor Hyams and released through Saguaro Road Records on June 24, 2008; it included a version of Soul Brothers Six song &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful.&quot; In 2010, McCain released &quot;The Best of Edwin McCain&quot;, a 20-year career retrospective that included a cross-section of material as well as a new single, &quot;Walk With You&quot; (produced by Don Was.) McCain&#x27;s 10th album, &quot;Mercy Bound&quot;, was released August 30, 2011.

On January 22, 2017, McCain sang the American National Anthem at Gillette Stadium for the AFC Championship Game between the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers. On November 29, 2019, McCain released his first Christmas album, &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;.

<doc id="231284" wikidata="Q728183" url="?curid=231284" title="CAN bus">
<text>A controller area network (CAN) is a vehicle bus standard designed to enable efficient communication primarily between electronic control units (ECUs). Originally developed to reduce the complexity and cost of electrical wiring in automobiles through multiplexing, the CAN bus protocol has since been adopted in various other contexts. This broadcast-based, message-oriented protocol ensures data integrity and prioritization through a process called arbitration, allowing the highest priority device to continue transmitting if multiple devices attempt to send data simultaneously, while others back off. Its reliability is enhanced by differential signaling, which mitigates electrical noise. Common versions of the CAN protocol include CAN 2.0, CAN FD, and CAN XL which vary in their data rate capabilities and maximum data payload sizes.

*CAN Bus Overview: The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a vehicle bus standard designed for efficient communication between electronic control units (ECUs) in vehicles, reducing wiring complexity and cost.
*Development and Adoption: Developed by Bosch in the 1980s, CAN was first used in the 1991 Mercedes-Benz W140. It has since become a standard in automotive and other industries.
*Versions and Standards: Versions include CAN 2.0, CAN FD, and CAN XL, each offering different data rates and payload sizes. ISO standards like ISO 11898 define the physical and data link layers.
*Applications: CAN is used in various vehicle subsystems, including engine control, autonomous driving, and diagnostics. It supports real-time communication and prioritization through arbitration.

== History ==
Development of the CAN bus started in 1983 at Robert Bosch GmbH. The protocol was officially released in 1986 at the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) conference in Detroit, Michigan. The first CAN controller chips were introduced by Intel in 1987, and shortly thereafter by Philips. Released in 1991, the Mercedes-Benz W140 was the first production vehicle to feature a CAN-based multiplex wiring system.

Bosch published several versions of the CAN specification. The latest is CAN 2.0, published in 1991. This specification has two parts. Part A is for the standard format with an 11-bit identifier, and part B is for the extended format with a 29-bit identifier. A CAN device that uses 11-bit identifiers is commonly called CAN 2.0A, and a CAN device that uses 29-bit identifiers is commonly called CAN 2.0B. These standards are freely available from Bosch along with other specifications and white papers.

In 1993, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released CAN standard ISO 11898, which was later restructured into two parts: ISO 11898-1 which covers the data link layer, and ISO 11898-2 which covers the CAN physical layer for high-speed CAN. ISO 11898-3 was released later and covers the CAN physical layer for low-speed, fault-tolerant CAN. The physical layer standards ISO 11898-2 and ISO 11898-3 are not part of the Bosch CAN 2.0 specification.

In 2012, Bosch released CAN FD 1.0, or CAN with Flexible Data-Rate. This specification uses a different frame format that allows a different data length as well as optionally switching to a faster bit rate after the arbitration is decided. CAN FD is compatible with existing CAN 2.0 networks so new CAN FD devices can coexist on the same network with existing CAN devices, using the same CAN 2.0 communication parameters. , Bosch was active in extending CAN standards.

The CAN bus is one of five protocols used in the on-board diagnostics (OBD)-II vehicle diagnostics standard. The OBD-II standard has been mandatory for all cars and light trucks sold in the United States since model year 1996. The EOBD standard has been mandatory for all petrol vehicles sold in the European Union since 2001 and all diesel vehicles since 2004.

== Applications ==
* Passenger vehicles, trucks, buses (combustion vehicles and electric vehicles)
* Agricultural equipment
* Electronic equipment for aviation and navigation
* Electric generators
* Industrial automation and mechanical control
* Elevators, escalators
* Building automation
* Medical instruments and equipment
* Pedelecs
* Model railways/railroads
* Ships and other maritime applications
* Lighting control systems
* 3D printers
* Robotics/Automation

=== Automotive ===
The modern automobile may have as many as 70 electronic control units (ECUs) for various subsystems. Usually the biggest processor is the engine control unit. Others are used for autonomous driving, advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), transmission, airbags, antilock braking/ABS, cruise control, electric power steering, audio systems, power windows, doors, mirror adjustment, battery and recharging systems for hybrid/electric cars, etc. Some of these form independent subsystems, but communication among others is essential. A subsystem may need to control actuators or receive feedback from sensors. The CAN standard was devised to fill this need. One key advantage is that interconnection between different vehicle systems can allow a wide range of safety, economy and convenience features to be implemented using software alone - functionality which would add cost and complexity if such features were &quot;hard wired&quot; using traditional automotive electrics. Examples include:

* Auto start/stop: Various sensor inputs from around the vehicle (speed sensors, steering angle, air conditioning on/off, engine temperature) are collated via the CAN bus to determine whether the engine can be shut down when stationary for improved fuel economy and emissions.
* Electric park brakes: The &quot;hill hold&quot; functionality takes input from the vehicle&#x27;s tilt sensor (also used by the burglar alarm) and the road speed sensors (also used by the ABS, engine control and traction control) via the CAN bus to determine if the vehicle is stopped on an incline. Similarly, inputs from seat belt sensors (part of the airbag controls) are fed from the CAN bus to determine if the seat belts are fastened, so that the parking brake will automatically release upon moving off.
* Parking assist systems: when the driver engages reverse gear, the transmission control unit can send a signal via the CAN bus to activate both the parking sensor system and the door control module for the passenger side door mirror to tilt downward to show the position of the curb. The CAN bus also takes inputs from the rain sensor to trigger the rear windscreen wiper when reversing.
* Auto lane assist/collision avoidance systems: The inputs from the parking sensors are also used by the CAN bus to feed outside proximity data to driver assist systems such as Lane Departure warning, and more recently, these signals travel through the CAN bus to actuate brake by wire in active collision avoidance systems.
* Auto brake wiping: Input is taken from the rain sensor (used primarily for the automatic windscreen wipers) via the CAN bus to the ABS module to initiate an imperceptible application of the brakes while driving to clear moisture from the brake rotors. Some high-performance Audi and BMW models incorporate this feature.
* Sensors can be placed at the most suitable place, and their data used by several ECUs. For example, outdoor temperature sensors (conventionally placed in the front) can be placed in the outside mirrors, avoiding heating by the engine, and data used by the engine, the climate control, and the driver display.

In recent years, the LIN bus (Local Interconnect Network) standard has been introduced to complement CAN for non-critical subsystems such as air-conditioning and infotainment, where data transmission speed and reliability are less critical.

=== Other ===
* The CAN bus protocol has been used on the Shimano DI2 electronic gear shift system for road bicycles since 2009, and is also used by the Ansmann and BionX systems in their direct drive motor.
* The CAN bus is also used as a fieldbus in general automation environments, primarily due to the low cost of some CAN controllers and processors.
* Manufacturers including NISMO aim to use CAN bus data to recreate real-life racing laps in the videogame &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot; using the game&#x27;s GPS Data Logger function, which would then allow players to race against real laps.
* Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Applied Physics Laboratory&#x27;s Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) uses a local CAN bus to facilitate communication between servos and microcontrollers in the prosthetic arm.
* Teams in the FIRST Robotics Competition widely use CAN bus to communicate between the roboRIO and other robot control modules.
* The CueScript teleprompter range uses CAN bus protocol over coaxial cable, to connect its CSSC – Desktop Scroll Control to the main unit
* The CAN bus protocol is widely implemented due to its fault tolerance in electrically noisy environments such as model railroad sensor feedback systems by major commercial Digital Command Control system manufacturers and various open-source digital model railroad control projects.
* Shearwater Research have implemented the protocol as DiveCAN to use integrating their dive computers into diving rebreathers from various manufacturers.

== Versions ==

=== CAN 2.0 (Classical CAN) ===
Due to its legacy, CAN 2.0 is the most widely used protocol with a maximum payload size of eight bytes and a typical baud rate of 500 kbit/s. Classical CAN, which includes CAN 2.0A (Standard CAN) and CAN 2.0B (Extended CAN), primarily differs in identifier field lengths: CAN 2.0A uses an 11-bit identifier, while CAN 2.0B employs a 29-bit identifier. The longer identifier in CAN 2.0B allows for a greater number of unique message identifiers, which is beneficial in complex systems with many nodes and data types. However, this increase in unique message identifiers also increases frame length, which in turn reduces the maximum data rate. Additionally, the extended identifier provides finer control over message prioritization due to more available identifier values. This, however, may introduce compatibility issues; CAN 2.0B devices can generally communicate with CAN 2.0A devices, but not vice versa, due to potential errors in handling longer identifiers. High-speed CAN 2.0 supports bit rates from 40 kbit/s to 1 Mbit/s and is the basis for higher-layer protocols. In contrast, low-speed CAN 2.0 supports bit rates from 40 kbit/s to 125 kbit/s and offers fault tolerance by allowing communication to continue despite a fault in one of the two wires, with each node maintaining its own termination.

=== CAN FD ===
CAN FD (Flexible Data-Rate), standardized as ISO 11898-1, was developed by Bosch and released in 2012 to meet the need for increased data transfer in modern high-performance vehicles. It offers variable data rates during the transmission of a single frame, allowing the arbitration phase to occur at a lower data rate for robust communication, while the data payload is transmitted at a higher data rate to improve throughput, which is particularly useful in electrically noisy environments for better noise immunity. CAN FD also introduces a flexible data field size, increasing the maximum size from 8 bytes to 64 bytes. This flexibility allows for more efficient data transmission by reducing the number of frames needed for large data transfers, which is beneficial for applications like high-resolution sensor data or software updates.

CAN FD maintains backward compatibility with CAN 2.0 devices by using the same frame format as CAN 2.0B, with the addition of a new control field to indicate whether the frame is a CAN FD frame or a standard CAN 2.0 frame. This allows CAN FD devices to coexist with CAN 2.0 devices on the same bus, while higher data rates and larger data payloads are available only when communicating with other CAN FD devices.

=== CAN XL ===
CAN XL, specified by CiA 610-1 and standardized as part of ISO11898-1, supports up to 2,048-byte payloads and data rates up to 20 Mbit/s. It bridges the gap between CAN FD and Ethernet (100BASE-T1) while maintaining CAN&#x27;s collision-resolution benefits. CAN XL controllers can also handle Classical CAN and CAN FD communication, ensuring compatibility in mixed networks. Its large data fields allow for higher layer protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) and the tunneling of Ethernet frames.

== Architecture ==
=== Physical organization ===
CAN is a multi-master serial bus standard for connecting electronic control units (ECUs) also known as nodes (automotive electronics is a major application domain). Two or more nodes are required on the CAN bus to communicate. A node may interface to devices from simple digital logic e.g. PLD, via FPGA up to an embedded computer running extensive software. Such a computer may also be a gateway allowing a general-purpose computer (like a laptop) to communicate over a USB or Ethernet port to the devices on a CAN bus.

All nodes are connected to each other through a physically conventional &quot;two-wire bus&quot;. The wires are a twisted pair with a 120 Ω (nominal) characteristic impedance.

This bus uses differential wired-AND signals. Two signals, CAN high (CANH) and CAN low (CANL) are either driven to a &quot;dominant&quot; state with CANH &gt; CANL, or not driven and pulled by passive resistors to a &quot;recessive&quot; state with CANH ≤ CANL. A 0 data bit encodes a dominant state, while a 1 data bit encodes a recessive state, supporting a wired-AND convention, which gives nodes with lower ID numbers priority on the bus.
ISO 11898-2, also called &quot;high-speed CAN&quot; (bit speeds up to 1Mbit/s on CAN, 5Mbit/s on CAN-FD), uses a linear bus terminated at each end with a 120 Ω resistor.

High-speed CAN signaling drives the CANH wire towards 3.5 V and the CANL wire towards 1.5V when any device is transmitting a dominant (0), while if no device is transmitting a dominant, the terminating resistors passively return the two wires to the recessive (1) state with a nominal differential voltage of 0V. (Receivers consider any differential voltage of less than 0.5V to be recessive.) The dominant differential voltage is a nominal 2V. The dominant common mode voltage (CANH+CANL)/2 must be within 1.5 to 3.5V of common, while the recessive common mode voltage must be within ±12 of common.
ISO 11898-3, also called &quot;low-speed&quot; or &quot;fault-tolerant CAN&quot; (up to 125kbit/s), uses a linear bus, star bus or multiple star buses connected by a linear bus and is terminated at each node by a fraction of the overall termination resistance. The overall termination resistance should be close to, but not less than, 100Ω.

Low-speed fault-tolerant CAN signaling operates similarly to high-speed CAN, but with larger voltage swings. The dominant state is transmitted by driving CANH towards the device power supply voltage (5V or 3.3V), and CANL towards 0V when transmitting a dominant (0), while the termination resistors pull the bus to a recessive state with CANH at 0V and CANL at 5V. This allows a simpler receiver that just considers the sign of CANH−CANL. Both wires must be able to handle −27 to +40V without damage.

=== Electrical properties ===
With both high-speed and low-speed CAN, the speed of the transition is faster when a recessive-to-dominant transition occurs since the CAN wires are being actively driven. The speed of the dominant-to-recessive transition depends primarily on the length of the CAN network and the capacitance of the wire used.

High-speed CAN is usually used in automotive and industrial applications where the bus runs from one end of the environment to the other. Fault-tolerant CAN is often used where groups of nodes need to be connected together.

The specifications require the bus be kept within a minimum and maximum common mode bus voltage but do not define how to keep the bus within this range.

The CAN bus must be terminated. The termination resistors are needed to suppress reflections as well as return the bus to its recessive or idle state.

High-speed CAN uses a 120 Ω resistor at each end of a linear bus. Low-speed CAN uses resistors at each node. Other types of terminations may be used such as the Terminating Bias Circuit defined in ISO11783.

A provides power and ground in addition to the CAN signaling on a four-wire cable. This provides automatic electrical bias and termination at each end of each bus segment. An ISO11783 network is designed for hot plug-in and removal of bus segments and ECUs.

=== Nodes ===

Each node requires a
*Central processing unit, microprocessor, or host processor
**The host processor decides what the received messages mean and what messages it wants to transmit.
**Sensors, actuators and control devices can be connected to the host processor.
*CAN controller- often an integral part of the microcontroller
**Receiving: the CAN controller stores the received serial bits from the bus until an entire message is available, which can then be fetched by the host processor (usually by the CAN controller triggering an interrupt).
**Sending: the host processor sends the transmit message(s) to a CAN controller, which transmits the bits serially onto the bus when the bus is free.
*Transceiver Defined by ISO 11898-2/3 Medium Access Unit [MAU] standards
**Receiving: it converts the data stream from CAN bus levels to levels that the CAN controller uses. It usually has protective circuitry to protect the CAN controller.
**Transmitting: it converts the data stream from the CAN controller to CAN bus levels.

Each node is able to send and receive messages, but not simultaneously. A message or Frame consists primarily of the ID (identifier), which represents the priority of the message, and up to eight data bytes. A CRC, acknowledge slot [ACK] and other overhead are also part of the message. The improved CAN FD extends the length of the data section to up to 64 bytes per frame. The message is transmitted serially onto the bus using a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) format and may be received by all nodes.

The devices that are connected by a CAN network are typically sensors, actuators, and other control devices. These devices are connected to the bus through a host processor, a CAN controller, and a CAN transceiver.

== Data transmission ==
CAN data transmission uses a lossless bitwise arbitration method of contention resolution. This arbitration method requires all nodes on the CAN network to be synchronized to sample every bit on the CAN network at the same time. This is why some call CAN synchronous. Unfortunately the term synchronous is imprecise since the data is transmitted in an asynchronous format, namely without a clock signal.

The CAN specifications use the terms &quot;dominant&quot; bits and &quot;recessive&quot; bits, where dominant is a logical 0 (actively driven to a voltage by the transmitter) and recessive is a logical 1 (passively returned to a voltage by a resistor). The idle state is represented by the recessive level (Logical 1). If one node transmits a dominant bit and another node transmits a recessive bit then there is a collision and the dominant bit wins. This means there is no delay to the higher-priority message, and the node transmitting the lower-priority message automatically attempts to re-transmit six-bit clocks after the end of the dominant message. This makes CAN very suitable as a real-time prioritized communications system.

The exact voltages for a logical 0 or 1 depend on the physical layer used, but the basic principle of CAN requires that each node listen to the data on the CAN network including the transmitting node(s) itself (themselves). If a logical 1 is transmitted by all transmitting nodes at the same time, then a logical 1 is seen by all of the nodes, including both the transmitting node(s) and receiving node(s). If a logical 0 is transmitted by all transmitting node(s) at the same time, then a logical 0 is seen by all nodes. If a logical 0 is being transmitted by one or more nodes, and a logical 1 is being transmitted by one or more nodes, then a logical 0 is seen by all nodes including the node(s) transmitting the logical 1. When a node transmits a logical 1 but sees a logical 0, it realizes that there is a contention and it quits transmitting. By using this process, any node that transmits a logical 1, when another node transmits a logical 0, loses the arbitration and drops out. A node that loses arbitration re-queues its message for later transmission and the CAN frame bit-stream continues without error until only one node is left transmitting. This means that the node that transmits the first 1 loses arbitration. Since the 11 (or 29 for CAN 2.0B) bit identifier is transmitted by all nodes at the start of the CAN frame, the node with the lowest identifier transmits more zeros at the start of the frame, and that is the node that wins the arbitration or has the highest priority.

For example, consider an 11-bit ID CAN network, with two nodes with IDs of 15 (binary representation, 00000001111) and 16 (binary representation, 00000010000). If these two nodes transmit at the same time, each will first transmit the start bit then transmit the first six zeros of their ID with no arbitration decision being made.

When ID bit 4 is transmitted, the node with the ID of 16 transmits a 1 (recessive) for its ID, and the node with the ID of 15 transmits a 0 (dominant) for its ID. When this happens, the node with the ID of 16 knows it transmitted a 1, but sees a 0 and realizes that there is a collision and it lost arbitration. Node 16 stops transmitting which allows the node with ID of 15 to continue its transmission without any loss of data. The node with the lowest ID will always win the arbitration and therefore has the highest priority.

Bit rates up to 1Mbit/s are possible at network lengths below 40m. Decreasing the bit rate allows longer network distances (e.g. 500m at 125kbit/s). The improved CAN FD standard allows increasing the bit rate after arbitration and can increase the speed of the data section by a factor of up to ten or more of the arbitration bit rate.

== ID allocation ==
Message IDs must be unique on a single CAN bus, otherwise two nodes would continue transmission beyond the end of the arbitration field (ID) causing an error.

In the early 1990s, the choice of IDs for messages was done simply on the basis of identifying the type of data and the sending node; however, as the ID is also used as the message priority, this led to poor real-time performance. In those scenarios, a low CAN bus use of around 30% was commonly required to ensure that all messages would meet their deadlines. However, if IDs are instead determined based on the deadline of the message, the lower the numerical ID and hence the higher the message priority, then bus use of 70 to 80% can typically be achieved before any message deadlines are missed.

== Bit timing ==
All nodes on the CAN network must operate at the same nominal bit rate, but noise, phase shifts, oscillator tolerance and oscillator drift mean that the actual bit rate might not be the nominal bit rate. Since a separate clock signal is not used, a means of synchronizing the nodes is necessary. Synchronization is important during arbitration since the nodes in arbitration must be able to see both their transmitted data and the other nodes&#x27; transmitted data at the same time. Synchronization is also important to ensure that variations in oscillator timing between nodes do not cause errors.

Synchronization starts with a hard synchronization on the first recessive to dominant transition after a period of bus idle (the start bit). Resynchronization occurs on every recessive to dominant transition during the frame. The CAN controller expects the transition to occur at a multiple of the nominal bit time. If the transition does not occur at the exact time the controller expects it, the controller adjusts the nominal bit time accordingly.

The adjustment is accomplished by dividing each bit into a number of time slices called quanta, and assigning some number of quanta to each of the four segments within the bit: synchronization, propagation, phase segment 1 and phase segment 2.

The number of quanta the bit is divided into can vary by controller, and the number of quanta assigned to each segment can be varied depending on bit rate and network conditions.

A transition that occurs before or after it is expected causes the controller to calculate the time difference and lengthen phase segment 1 or shorten phase segment 2 by this time. This effectively adjusts the timing of the receiver to the transmitter to synchronize them. This resynchronization process is done continuously at every recessive to dominant transition to ensure the transmitter and receiver stay in sync. Continuously resynchronizing reduces errors induced by noise, and allows a receiving node that was synchronized to a node that lost arbitration to resynchronize to the node which won arbitration.

== Layers ==
The CAN protocol, like many networking protocols, can be decomposed into the following abstraction layers:
; Application layer
* Application-specific logic
; Object layer
* Message filtering (mailboxes)
* Message and status handling
; Transfer layer
Most of the CAN standard applies to the transfer layer. The transfer layer receives messages from the physical layer and transmits those messages to the object layer. The transfer layer is responsible for bit timing and synchronization, message framing, arbitration, acknowledgment, error detection and signaling, and fault confinement. It performs:
* Fault confinement
* Error detection
* Message validation
* Acknowledgement
* Arbitration
* Message framing
* Transfer rate and timing
* Information routing
; Physical layer

CAN bus (ISO 11898-1:2003) originally specified the link layer protocol with only abstract requirements for the physical layer, e.g., asserting the use of a medium with multiple-access at the bit level through the use of dominant and recessive states. The electrical aspects of the physical layer (voltage, current, number of conductors) were specified in ISO 11898-2:2003, which is now widely accepted. However, the mechanical aspects of the physical layer (connector type and number, colors, labels, pin-outs) have yet to be formally specified. As a result, an automotive ECU will typically have a particular—often custom—connector with various sorts of cables, of which two are the CAN bus lines. Nonetheless, several de facto standards for mechanical implementation have emerged, the most common being the 9-pin D-sub type male connector with the following pin-out:
* pin 2: CAN-Low (CAN−)
* pin 3: GND (ground)
* pin 7: CAN-High (CAN+)
* pin 9: CAN V+ (power)

This &quot;de facto&quot; mechanical standard for CAN could be implemented with the node having both male and female 9-pin D-sub connectors electrically wired to each other in parallel within the node. Bus power is fed to a node&#x27;s male connector and the bus draws power from the node&#x27;s female connector. This follows the electrical engineering convention that power sources are terminated at female connectors. Adoption of this standard avoids the need to fabricate custom splitters to connect two sets of bus wires to a single D connector at each node. Such nonstandard (custom) wire harnesses (splitters) that join conductors outside the node reduce bus reliability, eliminate cable interchangeability, reduce compatibility of wiring harnesses, and increase cost.

The absence of a complete physical layer specification (mechanical in addition to electrical) freed the CAN bus specification from the constraints and complexity of physical implementation. However, it left CAN bus implementations open to interoperability issues due to mechanical incompatibility. In order to improve interoperability, many vehicle makers have generated specifications describing a set of allowed CAN transceivers in combination with requirements on the parasitic capacitance on the line. The allowed parasitic capacitance includes both capacitors as well as ESD protection (ESD against ISO 7637-3). In addition to parasitic capacitance, 12V and 24V systems do not have the same requirements in terms of line maximum voltage. Indeed, during jump start events light vehicle lines can go up to 24V while truck systems can go as high as 36V. New solutions are emerging, allowing the same component to be used for CAN as well as CAN FD (see ).

Noise immunity on ISO 11898-2:2003 is achieved by maintaining the differential impedance of the bus at a low level with low-value resistors (120 ohms) at each end of the bus. However, when dormant, a low-impedance bus such as CAN draws more current (and power) than other voltage-based signaling buses. On CAN bus systems, balanced line operation, where current in one signal line is exactly balanced by current in the opposite direction in the other signal provides an independent, stable 0V reference for the receivers. Best practice determines that CAN bus balanced pair signals be carried in twisted pair wires in a shielded cable to minimize RF emission and reduce interference susceptibility in the already noisy RF environment of an automobile.

ISO 11898-2 provides some immunity to common mode voltage between transmitter and receiver by having a 0V rail running along the bus to maintain a high degree of voltage association between the nodes. Also, in the de facto mechanical configuration mentioned above, a supply rail is included to distribute power to each of the transceiver nodes. The design provides a common supply for all the transceivers. The actual voltage to be applied by the bus and which nodes apply to it are application-specific and not formally specified. Common practice node design provides each node with transceivers that are optically isolated from their node host and derive a 5V linearly regulated supply voltage for the transceivers from the universal supply rail provided by the bus. This usually allows operating margin on the supply rail sufficient to allow interoperability across many node types. Typical values of supply voltage on such networks are 7 to 30 V. However, the lack of a formal standard means that system designers are responsible for supply rail compatibility.

ISO 11898-2 describes the electrical implementation formed from a multi-dropped single-ended balanced line configuration with resistor termination at each end of the bus.
In this configuration a dominant state is asserted by one or more transmitters switching the CAN− to supply 0V and (simultaneously) switching CAN+ to the +5V bus voltage thereby forming a current path through the resistors that terminate the bus. As such the terminating resistors form an essential component of the signaling system, and are included, not just to limit wave reflection at high frequency.

During a recessive state, the signal lines and resistor(s) remain in a high-impedance state with respect to both rails. Voltages on both CAN+ and CAN− tend (weakly) towards a voltage midway between the rails. A recessive state is present on the bus only when none of the transmitters on the bus is asserting a dominant state.

During a dominant state, the signal lines and resistor(s) move to a low-impedance state with respect to the rails so that current flows through the resistor. CAN+ voltage tends to +5V and CAN− tends to 0V.

Irrespective of signal state the signal lines are always in a low-impedance state with respect to one another by virtue of the terminating resistors at the end of the bus.

This signaling strategy differs significantly from other balanced line transmission technologies such as RS-422/3, RS-485, etc. which employ differential line drivers/ receivers and use a signaling system based on the differential mode voltage of the balanced line crossing a notional 0V. Multiple access on such systems normally relies on the media supporting three states (active high, active low and inactive tri-state) and is dealt with in the time domain. Multiple access on CAN bus is achieved by the electrical logic of the system supporting just two states that are conceptually analogous to a ‘wired AND’ network.

== Frames ==
A CAN network can be configured to work with two different message (or &quot;frame&quot;) formats: the standard or base frame format (described in CAN 2.0 A and CAN 2.0 B), and the extended frame format (described only by CAN 2.0 B). The only difference between the two formats is that the &quot;CAN base frame&quot; supports a length of 11 bits for the identifier, and the &quot;CAN extended frame&quot; supports a length of 29 bits for the identifier, made up of the 11-bit identifier (base identifier) and an 18-bit extension (identifier extension). The distinction between CAN base frame format and CAN extended frame format is made by using the IDE bit, which is transmitted as dominant in case of an 11-bit frame, and transmitted as recessive in case of a 29-bit frame. CAN controllers that support extended frame format messages are also able to send and receive messages in CAN base frame format. All frames begin with a start-of-frame (SOF) bit that denotes the start of the frame transmission.

CAN has four frame types:
* Data frame: a frame containing node data for transmission
* Remote frame: a frame requesting the transmission of a specific identifier
* Error frame: a frame transmitted by any node detecting an error
* Overload frame: a frame to inject a delay between data or remote frame

=== Data frame ===
The data frame is the only frame for actual data transmission. There are two message formats:
* Base frame format: with 11 identifier bits
* Extended frame format: with 29 identifier bits

The CAN standard requires that the implementation must accept the base frame format and may accept the extended frame format, but must tolerate the extended frame format.

==== Base frame format ====
The frame format is as follows: The bit values are described for CAN-LO signal.


==== Extended frame format ====
The frame format is as follows on from here in the table below:


The two identifier fields (A &amp; B) combine to form a 29-bit identifier.

=== Remote frame ===
*Generally data transmission is performed on an autonomous basis with the data source node (e.g., a sensor) sending out a data frame. It is also possible, however, for a destination node to request the data from the source by sending a remote frame.
*There are two differences between a data frame and a remote frame. Firstly the RTR-bit is transmitted as a dominant bit in the data frame and secondly in the remote frame there is no data field. The DLC field indicates the data length of the requested message (not the transmitted one). I.e.,
:RTR = 0 ; DOMINANT in data frame
:RTR = 1 ; RECESSIVE in remote frame

In the event of a data frame and a remote frame with the same identifier being transmitted at the same time, the data frame wins arbitration due to the dominant RTR bit following the identifier.

=== Error frame ===
The error frame consists of two different fields:
* The first field is given by the superposition of ERROR FLAGS (6–12 dominant/recessive bits) contributed from different stations.
* The following second field is the ERROR DELIMITER (8 recessive bits).

There are two types of error flags:
;Active Error Flag: six dominant bits – Transmitted by a node detecting an error on the network that is in error state &quot;error active&quot;.
;Passive Error Flag: six recessive bits – Transmitted by a node detecting an active error frame on the network that is in error state &quot;error passive&quot;.

There are two error counters in CAN:
# Transmit error counter (TEC)
# Receive error counter (REC)

* When TEC or REC is greater than 127 and less than 255, a Passive Error frame will be transmitted on the bus.
* When TEC and REC is less than 128, an Active Error frame will be transmitted on the bus.
* When TEC is greater than 255, then the node enters into Bus Off state, where no frames will be transmitted.

=== Overload frame ===
The overload frame contains the two bit fields: Overload Flag and Overload Delimiter. There are two kinds of overload conditions that can lead to the transmission of an overload flag:
#The internal conditions of a receiver, which requires a delay of the next data frame or remote frame.
#Detection of a dominant bit during intermission.

The start of an overload frame due to case 1 is only allowed to be started at the first bit time of an expected intermission, whereas overload frames due to case 2 start one bit after detecting the dominant bit. Overload Flag consists of six dominant bits. The overall form corresponds to that of the active error flag. The overload flag&#x27;s form destroys the fixed form of the intermission field. As a consequence, all other stations also detect an overload condition and on their part start transmission of an overload flag. Overload Delimiter consists of eight recessive bits. The overload delimiter is of the same form as the error delimiter.

== ACK slot ==
The acknowledge slot is used to acknowledge the receipt of a valid CAN frame. Each node that receives the frame, without finding an error, transmits a dominant level in the ACK slot and thus overrides the recessive level of the transmitter. If a transmitter detects a recessive level in the ACK slot, it knows that no receiver found a valid frame. A receiving node may transmit a recessive to indicate that it did not receive a valid frame, but another node that did receive a valid frame may override this with a dominant. The transmitting node cannot know that the message has been received by all of the nodes on the CAN network.

Often, the mode of operation of the device is to re-transmit unacknowledged frames over and over. This may lead to eventually entering the &quot;error passive&quot; state.

== Interframe spacing ==
Data frames and remote frames are separated from preceding frames by a bit field called interframe space. Interframe space consists of at least three consecutive recessive (1) bits. Following that, if a dominant bit is detected, it will be regarded as the &quot;Start of frame&quot; bit of the next frame. Overload frames and error frames are not preceded by an interframe space and multiple overload frames are not separated by an interframe space. Interframe space contains the bit fields intermission and bus idle, and suspend transmission for error passive stations, which have been transmitter of the previous message.

== Bit stuffing ==

To ensure enough transitions to maintain synchronization, a bit of opposite polarity is inserted after five consecutive bits of the same polarity. This practice is called bit stuffing, and is necessary due to the non-return-to-zero (NRZ) coding used with CAN. The stuffed data frames are destuffed by the receiver.

All fields in the frame are stuffed with the exception of the CRC delimiter, ACK field and end of frame which are a fixed size and are not stuffed. In the fields where bit stuffing is used, six consecutive bits of the same polarity (111111 or 000000) are considered an error. An active error flag can be transmitted by a node when an error has been detected. The active error flag consists of six consecutive dominant bits and violates the rule of bit stuffing.

Bit stuffing means that data frames may be larger than one would expect by simply enumerating the bits shown in the tables above. The maximum increase in size of a CAN frame (base format) after bit stuffing is in the case

:11111000011110000...

which is stuffed as (stuffing bits in bold):

:111110000011111000001...

The stuffing bit itself may be the first of the five consecutive identical bits, so in the worst case there is one stuffing bit per four original bits.

The size of a base frame is bounded by

:formula_1

where is the number of data bytes, a maximum of 8.

Since formula_2 is the size of the frame before stuffing, in the worst case one bit will be added every four original bits after the first one (hence the −1 at the numerator) and, because of the layout of the bits of the header, only 34 out of 44 of them can be subject to bit stuffing.

An undesirable side effect of the bit stuffing scheme is that a small number of bit errors in a received message may corrupt the destuffing process, causing a larger number of errors to propagate through the destuffed message. This reduces the level of protection that would otherwise be offered by the CRC against the original errors. This deficiency of the protocol has been addressed in CAN FD frames by the use of a combination of fixed stuff bits and a counter that records the number of stuff bits inserted.

== CAN lower-layer standards ==
ISO 11898 series specifies physical and data link layer (levels 1 and 2 of the ISO/OSI model) of serial communication category called controller area network that supports distributed real-time control and multiplexing for use within road vehicles.

There are several CAN physical layer and other standards:

ISO 11898-1:2015 specifies the data link layer (DLL) and physical signalling of the controller area network (CAN). This document describes the general architecture of CAN in terms of hierarchical layers according to the ISO reference model for open systems interconnection (OSI) established in ISO/IEC 7498-1 and provides the characteristics for setting up an interchange of digital information between modules implementing the CAN DLL with detailed specification of the logical link control (LLC) sublayer and medium access control (MAC) sublayer.

ISO 11898-2:2016 specifies the high-speed (transmission rates of up to 1Mbit/s) medium access unit (MAU), and some medium-dependent interface (MDI) features (according to ISO 8802-3), which comprise the physical layer of the controller area network. ISO 11898-2 uses a two-wire balanced signaling scheme. It is the most used physical layer in vehicle powertrain applications and industrial control networks.

ISO 11898-3:2006 specifies low-speed, fault-tolerant, medium-dependent interface for setting up an interchange of digital information between electronic control units of road vehicles equipped with the CAN at transmission rates above 40kbit/s up to 125kbit/s.

ISO 11898-4:2004 specifies time-triggered communication in the CAN (TTCAN). It is applicable to setting up a time-triggered interchange of digital information between electronic control units (ECU) of road vehicles equipped with CAN, and specifies the frame synchronization entity that coordinates the operation of both logical link and media access controls in accordance with ISO 11898-1, to provide the time-triggered communication schedule.

ISO 11898-5:2007 specifies the CAN physical layer for transmission rates up to 1Mbit/s for use within road vehicles. It describes the medium access unit functions as well as some medium-dependent interface features according to ISO 8802-2. This represents an extension of ISO 11898-2, dealing with new functionality for systems requiring low-power consumption features while there is no active bus communication.

ISO 11898-6:2013 specifies the CAN physical layer for transmission rates up to 1Mbit/s for use within road vehicles. It describes the medium access unit functions as well as some medium-dependent interface features according to ISO 8802-2. This represents an extension of ISO 11898-2 and ISO 11898-5, specifying a selective wake-up mechanism using configurable CAN frames.

ISO 16845-1:2016 provides the methodology and abstract test suite necessary for checking the conformance of any CAN implementation of the CAN specified in ISO 11898-1.

ISO 16845-2:2018 establishes test cases and test requirements to realize a test plan verifying if the CAN transceiver with implemented selective wake-up functions conform to the specified functionalities. The kind of testing defined in ISO 16845-2:2018 is named as conformance testing.

== DBC ==
CAN DBC files are standardized ASCII files used to define messages sent over a CAN bus. They define the format and purpose of each type of message, including the message IDs, signal names, scaling, offsets, and data types, and provide an interoperable aid to developing CAN bus applications.

== CAN-based higher-layer protocols ==
As the CAN standard does not include common communication features, such as flow control, device addressing, and transportation of data blocks larger than one message, and above all, application data, many implementations of higher layer protocols were created. Several are standardized for a business area, although all can be extended by each manufacturer. For passenger cars, each manufacturer has its own standard.

CAN in Automation (CiA) is the international users&#x27; and manufacturers&#x27; organization that develops and supports CAN-based higher-layer protocols and their international standardization. Among these specifications are:

=== Standardized approaches ===
* ARINC 812 or ARINC 825 (aviation industry)
* CANopen - CiA 301/302-2 and EN 50325-4 (industrial automation)

== CANopen Lift ==
The CANopen Special Interest Group (SIG) &quot;Lift Control&quot;, which was founded in 2001, develops the CANopen application profile CiA 417 for lift control systems. It works on extending the features, improves technical content and ensures that the current legal standards for lift control systems are met. The first version of CiA 417 was published (available for CiA members) in summer 2003, version 2.0 in February 2010, version 2.1.0 in July 2012, version 2.2.0 in December 2015, and version 2.3.1 in February 2020.

Jörg Hellmich (ELFIN GmbH) is the chairman of this SIG and manages a wiki of the CANopen lift community with content about CANopen lift.

== Security ==
CAN is a low-level protocol and does not support any security features intrinsically. There is also no encryption in standard CAN implementations, which leaves these networks open to man-in-the-middle frame interception. In most implementations, applications are expected to deploy their own security mechanisms; e.g., to authenticate incoming commands or the presence of certain devices on the network. Failure to implement adequate security measures may result in various sorts of attacks if the opponent manages to insert messages on the bus. While passwords exist for some safety-critical functions, such as modifying firmware, programming keys, or controlling antilock brake actuators, these systems are not implemented universally and have a limited number of seed/key pairs.

== Development tools ==
When developing or troubleshooting the CAN bus, examination of hardware signals can be very important. Logic analyzers and bus analyzers are tools that collect, analyse, decode and store signals so people can view the high-speed waveforms at their leisure. There are also specialist tools as well as CAN bus monitors.

A is an analysis tool, often a combination of hardware and software, used during development of hardware that uses the CAN bus.

Typically the CAN bus monitor will listen to the traffic on the CAN bus in order to display it in a user interface. Often the CAN bus monitor offers the possibility to simulate CAN bus activity by sending CAN frames to the bus. The CAN bus monitor can therefore be used to validate expected CAN traffic from a given device or to simulate CAN traffic in order to validate the reaction from a given device connected to the CAN bus.

== Licensing ==
Bosch holds patents on the technology, though those related to the original protocol have now expired. Manufacturers of CAN-compatible microprocessors pay license fees to Bosch for use of the CAN trademark and any of the newer patents related to CAN FD, and these are normally passed on to the customer in the price of the chip. Manufacturers of products with custom ASICs or FPGAs containing CAN-compatible modules need to pay a fee for the CAN Protocol License if they wish to use the CAN trademark or CAN FD capabilities.

<doc id="231286" wikidata="Q679020" url="?curid=231286" title="Obstetric fistula">
<text>Obstetric fistula is a medical condition in which a hole develops in the birth canal as a result of childbirth. This can be between the vagina and rectum, ureter, or bladder. It can result in incontinence of urine or feces. Complications may include depression, infertility, and social isolation.
Risk factors include obstructed labor, poor access to medical care, malnutrition, and teenage pregnancy. The underlying mechanism is poor blood flow to the affected area for a prolonged period of time. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and may be supported by use of methylene blue.
Obstetric fistulae are almost entirely preventable with appropriate use of cesarean section. Treatment is typically by surgery. If treated early, the use of a urinary catheter may help with healing. Counseling may also be useful. An estimated 2 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Arab region, and Latin America have the condition, with about 75,000 new cases developing a year. It occurs very rarely in the developed world and is considered a disease of poverty.
==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms of obstetric fistula include:
* Flatulence, urinary incontinence, or fecal incontinence, which may be continual or only happen at night
* Foul-smelling vaginal discharge
* Repeated vaginal or urinary tract infections
* Irritation or pain in the vagina or surrounding areas
* Pain during sexual activity

Other effects of obstetric fistulae include stillborn babies due to prolonged labor, which happens 85% to 100% of the time, severe ulcerations of the vaginal tract, &quot;foot drop&quot;, which is the paralysis of the lower limbs caused by nerve damage, making it impossible to walk, infection of the fistula forming an abscess, and up to two-thirds of sufferers become amenorrhoeic.

Obstetric fistulae have far-reaching physical, social, economic, and psychological consequences for the women affected. According to UNFPA, &quot;Due to the prolonged obstructed labour, the baby almost inevitably dies, and the parent is left with chronic incontinence. Unable to control the flow of urine or faeces, or both, they may be abandoned by their spouse and family and ostracized by their community. Without treatment, their prospects for work and family life are virtually nonexistent.&quot;

===Physical===

The most direct consequence of an obstetric fistula is the constant leakage of urine, feces, and blood as a result of a hole that forms between the vagina and bladder or rectum. This leaking has both physical and societal penalties. The acid in the urine, feces, and blood causes severe burn wounds on the legs from the continuous dripping. Nerve damage that can result from the leaking can cause women to struggle with walking and eventually lose mobility. In an attempt to avoid the dripping, women limit their intake of water and liquid, which can ultimately lead to dangerous cases of dehydration. Ulceration and infections can persist, as well as kidney disease and kidney failure, which can each lead to death. Further, only a quarter of women who develop a fistula in their first birth are able to have a living baby, and therefore have minuscule chances of conceiving a healthy baby later on. Some, due to obstetric fistulae and other complications from childbirth, do not survive.

===Social===
Physical consequences of obstetric fistulae lead to severe sociocultural stigmatization for various reasons. For example, in Burkina Faso, most citizens do not believe an obstetric fistula to be a medical condition, but as a divine punishment or a curse for disloyal or disrespectful behavior. Other sub-Saharan cultures view offspring as an indicator of a family&#x27;s wealth. A woman who is unable to successfully produce children as assets for her family is believed to make her and her family socially and economically inferior. A patient&#x27;s incontinence and pain also render her unable to perform household chores and childrearing as a wife and as a mother, thus devaluing her. Other misconceptions about obstetric fistulae are that they are caused by venereal diseases or are divine punishment for sexual misconduct.

As a result, many girls are divorced or abandoned by their husbands and partners, disowned by family, ridiculed by friends, and even isolated by health workers. Divorce rates for women who have an obstetric fistula range from 50% to as high as 89%. Now marginalized members of society, girls are forced to live on the edges of their villages and towns, often in isolation in a hut where they will likely die from starvation or an infection in the birth canal. The unavoidable odor is viewed as offensive, thus their removal from society is seen as essential. Accounts of women who develop obstetric fistulae proclaim that their lives have been reduced to the leaking of urine, feces, and blood because they are no longer capable or allowed to participate in traditional activities, including the duties of wife and mother. Because such consequences highly stigmatize and marginalize the woman, the intense loneliness and shame can lead to clinical depression and suicidal thoughts. Some women have formed small groups and resorted to walking to seek medical help, where their characteristic odor makes them a target for sub-Saharan predatory wildlife, further endangering their lives. This trip can take on average 12 hours to complete. Moreover, women are sometimes forced to turn to commercial sex work as a means of survival because the extreme poverty and social isolation that result from obstetric fistulae eliminate all other income opportunities. With only 7.5% of women with fistulae able to access treatment, the vast majority of women end up with the consequences of obstructed and prolonged labor simply because options and access to help is so limited.

===Psychological===
Some common psychological consequences that women with a fistula face are the despair from losing their child, the humiliation from their smell, and inability to perform their family roles. Additionally, a fear of developing another fistula in future pregnancies exists.

Obstetric fistula is not only debilitating physically, but emotionally. A woman is presented with an array of psychological trauma that she must oftentimes deal with herself unless provided with ample resources. Oftentimes ostracized by her community, a woman with obstetric fistula tends to face these issues on her own. In a study of The lived experience of Malawian women with obstetric fistula, the immense psychological trauma is addressed: &quot;For these women, internalizing this constant struggle leads to psychological morbidity.&quot; It was striking how many women discussed constant sadness and giving up hope in their interviews.&quot;

Although the psychological impacts center around the woman experiencing the fistula, others around them, and especially loved ones, feel the impact as well. The same study references this: &quot;This attitude was often shared by their family members, both husbands and female relatives.&quot;

Women with obstetric fistula face severe mental health issues. Among women with obstetric fistula from Bangladesh and Ethiopia 97% screened positive for potential mental health dysfunctions and about 30% had major depression.

==Risk factors==
In less-developed countries, obstetric fistulae usually develop as a result of prolonged labor when a cesarean section cannot be obtained. Over the course of the three to five days of labor, the unborn child presses against the mother&#x27;s vagina very tightly, cutting off blood flow to the surrounding tissues between the vagina and the rectum and between the vagina and the bladder, causing the tissues to disintegrate and rot away.

Obstetric fistulae can also be caused by poorly performed abortions, and pelvic fracture, cancer, or radiation therapy targeted at the pelvic area, inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis). Other potential causes for the development of obstetric fistulae are sexual abuse and rape, especially in conflict/postconflict areas, and other trauma, such as surgical trauma.

In the developed world, such as the US, the primary cause of obstetric fistulae, particularly rectovaginal fistulae, is the use of episiotomy and forceps. Primary risk factors include early or closely spaced pregnancies and lack of access to emergency obstetric care. For example, a 1983 study in Nigeria found that 54.8% of the women affected were under 20 years of age, and 64.4% gave birth at home or in poorly equipped local clinics. When available at all, cesarean sections and other medical interventions are usually not performed until after tissue damage has already been done.

Social, political, and economic causes that indirectly lead to the development of obstetric fistulae concern issues of poverty, malnutrition, lack of education, early marriage and childbirth, the role and status of women in developing countries, harmful traditional practices, sexual violence, and lack of good quality or accessible maternal and health care.

===Poverty===
Poverty is the main indirect cause of obstetric fistulae around the world. As obstructed labor and obstetric fistulae account for 8% of maternal deaths worldwide and &quot;a 60-fold difference in gross national product per person shows up as a 120-fold difference in maternal mortality ratio,&quot; impoverished countries produce higher maternal mortality rates and thus higher obstetric fistula rates. Furthermore, impoverished countries not only have low incomes, but also lack adequate infrastructure, trained and educated professionals, resources, and a centralized government that exist in developed nations to effectively eradicate obstetric fistulae.

According to UNFPA, &quot;Generally accepted estimates suggest that 2.0-3.5 million women live with obstetric fistulae in the developing world, and between 50,000 and 100,000 new cases develop each year. All but eliminated from the developed world, obstetric fistula continues to affect the poorest of the poor: women and girls living in some of the most resource-starved remote regions in the world.&quot;

===Malnutrition===
One reason that poverty produces such high rates of fistula cases is the malnutrition that exists in such areas. Lack of money and access to proper nutrition, as well as vulnerability to diseases that exist in impoverished areas because of limited basic health care and disease prevention methods, cause inhabitants of these regions to experience stunted growth. Sub-Saharan Africa is one such environment where the shortest women have on average lighter babies and more difficulties during birth when compared with full-grown women. This stunted growth causes expectant mothers to have skeletons unequipped for proper birth, such as an underdeveloped pelvis. This weak and underdeveloped bone structure increases the chances that the baby will get stuck in the pelvis during birth, cutting off circulation and leading to tissue necrosis. Because of the correlation between malnutrition, stunted growth, and birthing difficulties, maternal height can at times be used as a measure for expected labor difficulties.

===Lack of education===
High levels of poverty also lead to low levels of education among impoverished women concerning maternal health. This lack of information in combination with obstacles preventing rural women to easily travel to and from hospitals lead many to arrive at the birthing process without prenatal care. This can cause a development of unplanned complications that may arise during home births, in which traditional techniques are used. These techniques often fail in the event of unplanned emergencies, leading women to go to the hospital for care too late, desperately ill, and therefore vulnerable to the risks of anesthesia and surgery that must be used on them. In a study of women who had prenatal care and those who had unbooked emergency births, &quot;the death rate in the booked-healthy group was as good as that in many developed countries, [but] the death rate in the unbooked emergencies was the same as the death rate in England in the 16th and 17th centuries.&quot; In this study, 62 unbooked emergency women were diagnosed with obstetric fistulae out of 7,707 studied, in comparison to three diagnosed booked mothers out of 15,020 studied. In addition, studies find that education is associated with lower desired family size, greater use of contraceptives, and increased use of professional medical services. Educated families are also more likely to be able to afford health care, especially maternal healthcare.

===Early childbirth===

In sub-Saharan Africa, many girls enter into arranged marriages soon after menarche (usually between the ages of 9 and 15). Social factors and economic factors contribute to this practice of early marriages. Socially, some grooms want to ensure their brides are virgins when they get married, so an earlier marriage is desirable. Economically, the bride price received and having one less person to feed in the family helps alleviate the financial burdens of the bride&#x27;s family. Early marriages lead to early childbirth, which increases the risk of obstructed labor, since young mothers who are poor and malnourished may have underdeveloped pelvises. In fact, obstructed labor is responsible for 76 to 97% of obstetric fistulae.

===Lack of healthcare===

Even women who do make it to the hospital may not get proper treatment. Countries that suffer from poverty, civil and political unrest or conflict, and other dangerous public health issues such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis often suffer from a severe burden and breakdown within the healthcare system. This breakdown puts many people at risk, specifically women. Many hospitals within these conditions have shortages of staff, supplies, and other forms of medical technology that would be necessary to perform reconstructive obstetric fistula repair. There is a shortage of doctors in rural Africa, and studies find that the doctors and nurses who do exist in rural Africa often do not show up for work.

Poverty hinders women from being able to access normal and emergency obstetric care because of long distances and expensive procedures. For some women, the closest maternal care facility can be more than 50 km away. In Kenya, a study by the Ministry of Health found that the &quot;rugged landscape, long distances to health facilities, and societal preferences for delivery with a traditional birth attendant contributed to delays in accessing necessary obstetric care.&quot; Emergency cesarean sections, which can help avoid fistulae caused by prolonged vaginal deliveries, are very expensive.

===Status of women===
In developing countries, women who are affected by obstetric fistulae do not necessarily have full agency over their bodies or their households. Rather, their husbands and other family members have control in determining the healthcare that the women receive. For example, a woman&#x27;s family may refuse medical examinations for the patient by male doctors, but female doctors may be unavailable, thus barring women from prenatal care. Furthermore, many societies believe that women are supposed to suffer in childbirth, thus are less inclined to support maternal health efforts.

==Prevention==
Prevention is the key to ending fistulae. UNFPA states that, &quot;Ensuring skilled birth attendance at all births and providing emergency obstetric care for all women who develop complications during delivery would make fistula as rare in developing countries as it is in the industrialized world.&quot; In addition, access to health services and education – including family planning, gender equality, higher living standards, child marriage, and human rights – must be addressed to reduce the marginalization of women and girls. Reducing marginalization in these areas could reduce maternal disability and death by at least 20%.

Prevention comes in the form of access to obstetrical care, support from trained health care professionals throughout pregnancy, providing access to family planning, promoting the practice of spacing between births, supporting women in education, and postponing early marriage. Fistula prevention also involves many strategies to educate local communities about the cultural, social, and physiological factors of that condition and contribute to the risk for fistulae. One of these strategies involves organizing community-level awareness campaigns to educate women about prevention methods such as proper hygiene and care during pregnancy and labor. Prevention of prolonged obstructed labor and fistulae should preferably begin as early as possible in each woman&#x27;s life. For example, improved nutrition and outreach programs to raise awareness about the nutritional needs of children to prevent malnutrition, as well as improve the physical maturity of young mothers, are important fistula prevention strategies. It is also important to ensure access to timely and safe delivery during childbirth: measures include availability and provision of emergency obstetric care, as well as quick and safe cesarean sections for women in obstructed labor. Some organizations train local nurses and midwives to perform emergency cesarean sections to avoid vaginal delivery for young mothers who have underdeveloped pelvises. Midwives located in the local communities where obstetric fistulae are prevalent can contribute to promoting health practices that help prevent future development of obstetric fistulae. NGOs also work with local governments, like the government of Niger, to offer free cesarean sections, further preventing the onset of obstetric fistulae.

Promoting education for girls is also a key factor to preventing fistulae in the long term. Former fistula patients often act as &quot;community fistula advocates&quot; or &quot;ambassadors of hope&quot;, a UNFPA-sponsored initiative, to educate the community. These survivors help current patients, educate pregnant mothers, and dispel cultural myths that obstetric fistulae are caused by adultery or evil spirits. Successful ambassador programs are in place in Kenya, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Ghana, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and Liberia.

Several organizations have developed effective fistula prevention strategies. One, the Tanzanian Midwives Association, works to prevent fistulae by improving clinical healthcare for women, encouraging the delay of early marriages and childbearing years, and helping the local communities to advocate for women&#x27;s rights.

==Treatment==
===Surgery===
The nature of the injury varies depending on the size and location of the fistula, so a surgeon with experience is needed to improvise on the spot. Before the person undergoes surgery, treatment and evaluation are needed for conditions including anemia, malnutrition, and malaria. Quality treatment in low-resource settings are possible (as in the cases of Nigeria and Ethiopia).

Treatment is available through reconstructive surgery. Primary fistula repair has a 91% success rate. The corrective surgery costs about US$100–400, and the cost for the entire procedure, which includes the actual surgery, postoperative care, and rehabilitation support, is estimated to cost $300–450. Initial surgeries done by inadequately trained doctors and midwives increase the number of follow-up surgeries that must be performed to restore full continence. Successful surgery enables women to live normal lives and have more children, but it is recommended to have a cesarean section to prevent the fistula from recurring. Postoperative care is vital to prevent infection. Some women are not candidates for this surgery due to other health problems. In those cases, fecal diversion can help the patient, but not necessarily cure them.

Besides physical treatment, mental health services are also needed to rehabilitate fistula patients, who experience psychological trauma from being ostracized by the community and from fear of developing fistulae again. A study on the first formal counseling program for fistula survivors in Eritrea shows positive results, whereby counseling significantly improved the women&#x27;s self-esteem, knowledge about fistulae and fistula prevention, and behavioral intentions for &quot;health maintenance and social reintegration&quot; following surgery.

===Challenges===
Challenges with regards to treatment include the very high number of women needing reconstructive surgery, access to facilities and trained surgeons, and the cost of treatment. For many women, US$300 is a price they cannot afford. Access and availability of treatment also vary widely across different sub-Saharan countries. Certain regions also do not have enough maternal care clinics that are equipped, willing to treat fistula patients, and adequately staffed. At the Evangelical Hospital of Bemberéke in Benin, only one expatriate volunteer obstetrics and gynecology doctor is available a few months per year, with one certified nurse and seven informal hospital workers. In all of Niger, two medical centers treat fistula patients. In Nigeria, more dedicated health professionals operate on up to 1,600 women with a fistula per year. The world is currently severely under capacity for treating the problem; it would take up to 400 years to treat the backlog of patients. To prevent any new cases of obstetric fistulae, about 75,000 new emergency obstetric care facilities would have to be built in Africa alone, plus an increase in financial support and an even higher number of certified doctors, midwives, and nurses needed.

Another challenge standing between women and fistula treatment is information. Most women have no idea that treatment is available. Because this is a condition of shame and embarrassment, most women hide themselves and their condition and suffer in silence. In addition, after receiving initial treatment, health education is important to prevent fistulae in subsequent pregnancies.

Another challenge is the lack of trained professionals to provide surgery for fistula patients. As a result, nonphysicians are sometimes trained to provide obstetric services. For example, the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital has medical staff without formal degrees, and one of its top surgeons was illiterate, but she had been trained over years and now regularly successfully performs fistula surgery.

===Catheterization===
Fistula cases can also be treated through urethral catheterization if identified early enough. The Foley catheter is recommended because it has a balloon to hold it in place. The indwelling Foley catheter drains urine from the bladder. This decompresses the bladder wall so that the wounded edges come together and stay together, giving it a greater chance of closing naturally, at least in the smaller fistulae.

About 37% of obstetric fistulae that are treated within 75 days after birth with a Foley catheter resolve. Even without preselecting the least complicated obstetric fistula cases, a Foley catheter by midwives after the onset of urinary incontinence could treat over 25% of all new fistulae.

==Epidemiology==
Obstetric fistulae are common in the developing world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Benin, Chad, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia) and much of South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Nepal). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 women develop obstetric fistulae each year and over two million women currently live with an obstetric fistula. In particular, most of the two million-plus women in developing nations who develop obstetric fistulae are under the age of 30. Between 50 and 80% of women under the age of 20 in poor countries develop obstetric fistulae (the youngest patients are 12–13 years old). Other estimates indicate about 73,000 new cases occur per year.

Obstetric fistulae were very common throughout the world, but since the late 19th century, the rise of gynecology developed safe practices for childbirth, including giving birth at local hospitals rather than at home, which dramatically reduced rates of obstructed labor and obstetric fistulae in Europe and North America.

Adequate population-based epidemiological data on obstetric fistulae are lacking due to the historic neglect of this condition since it was mostly eradicated in developed nations. Available data are estimations that should be viewed with caution. About 30% of women over age 45 in developed nations are affected by urinary incontinence. The rate of obstetrical fistulae is much lower in places that discourage early marriage, encourage and provide general education for women, and grant women access to family planning and skilled medical teams to assist during childbirth.

==History==
Evidence of obstetric fistula dates back to 2050 BCE, when Queen Henhenit had a fistula.

The first acknowledgments of obstetric fistula date back to various Egyptian documents known as the papyri. These documents, including rare medical engravings, were found of the entrance of a tomb located in the necropolis of Saqquarah, Egypt. The tomb belonged to an unknown physician who lived during the 6th dynasty. The translation of this document became possible with the discovery of the Rosetta stone in 1799.

In 1872, the Ebers papyrus was discovered in a mummy from the Theban acropolis. This papyrus, 65 feet long, 14 inches wide, consisting of 108 columns each about 20 lines, now resides in the library at the University of Leipzig. The gynecological reference in this papyrus addresses uterine prolapse, but at the end of page three, there seems to be a mention of the vesicovaginal fistula, warning the physician against trying to cure it, saying, &quot;prescription for a woman whose urine is in an irksome place: if the urine keeps coming and she distinguishes it, she will be like this forever.&quot; This seems to be the oldest reference to vesicovaginal fistula, one which articulates the storied history of the problem.

James Marion Sims, in 1852 in Alabama, developed an operation for fistula. He worked at the New York Women&#x27;s Hospital.

==Society and culture==
During most of the 20th century, obstetric fistulae were largely missing from the international global health agenda. This is reflected by the fact that the condition was not included as a topic at the landmark United Nations 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). The 194-page report from the ICPD does not include any reference to obstetric fistulae. In 2000, eight Millennium Development Goals were adopted after the United Nations Millennium Summit to be achieved by 2015. The fifth goal of improving maternal health is directly related to obstetric fistula. Since 2003, obstetric fistula has been gaining awareness amongst the general public and has received critical attention from UNFPA, who has organized a global &quot;Campaign to End Fistula&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Nicholas Kristof, a Pulitzer Prize–winning writer, wrote several columns in 2003, 2005, and 2006 focusing on fistula and particularly treatment provided by Catherine Hamlin at the Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia. In 2007, Fistula Foundation, Engel Entertainment, and a number of other organizations including PBS NOVA released the documentary film, &quot;A Walk to Beautiful&quot;, which traced the journey of five women from Ethiopia who sought treatment for their obstetric fistulae at the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia. The film still airs frequently on PBS in the U.S. and is credited with increasing awareness of obstetric fistulae greatly. Increased public awareness and corresponding political pressure have helped fund the UNFPA&#x27;s Campaign to End Fistula, and helped motivate the United States Agency for International Development to dramatically increase funding for the prevention and treatment of obstetric fistulae.

Countries that signed the United Nations Millennium Declaration have begun adopting policies and creating task forces to address issues of maternal morbidity and infant mortality, including Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Uganda, Eritrea, Niger, and Kenya. Laws to increase the minimum age for marriage have also been enacted in Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Kenya. To monitor these countries and hold them accountable, the UN has developed six &quot;process indicators&quot;, a benchmark tool with minimum acceptable levels that measures whether or not women receive the services they need.

The UNFPA set out several strategies to address fistulae, including &quot;postponing marriage and pregnancy for young girls, increasing access to education and family planning services for women and men, provide access to adequate medical care for all pregnant women and emergency obstetric care for all who develop complications, and repairing physical damage through medical intervention and emotional damage through counselling.&quot; One of the UNFPA&#x27;s initiatives to reduce the cost of transportation in accessing medical care provided ambulances and motorcycles for women in Benin, Chad, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.

===Campaign to end fistula===

The Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia successfully treats women with obstetric fistulae, even in less than desirable environments. As a result, the UNFPA gathered partners in London in 2001, and officially launched an international initiative to address obstetric fistulae later in 2003. Partners in this initiative include Columbia University&#x27;s Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, and the World Health Organization. The official international partnership formed by the Campaign to End Fistula is named the Obstetric Fistula Working Group (OFWG) and its purpose is to coordinate and collaborate global efforts to eliminate obstetric fistulae.

The initiative&#x27;s first action was to quantitatively assess the issue in countries where the prevalence is suspected to be high, including nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The studies found that fistula patients are mostly illiterate, young, and poor women. Moreover, local legislators and government officials&#x27; lack of awareness exacerbate the problem. The OFWG improves awareness for prenatal and neonatal care and develops strategies for clinically managing obstetric fistula cases.

To date, the Campaign to End Fistula has involved more than 30 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, and completed rapid needs assessments in many of those countries to continually assess the needs in each country. The strategies that the campaign helps each nation to develop are three-fold: prevention of new cases, treatment for patients, and support for reintegration into society after the operation. Prevention efforts include access to maternal health services and mobilizing communities and legislators to increase awareness of maternal health problems. Training health providers and ensuring affordable treatment services, as well as providing social services such as health education and mental health services, help treat and reintegrate women into their communities. Other tasks undertaken by the campaign include fundraising and introducing new donors and gathering new partners of all perspectives, such as faith-based organizations, NGOs, and private-sector companies.

===Fistula Fortnight===
The Fistula Fortnight was a two-week initiative that took place from February 21 to March 6, 2005, where fistula experts treated fistula patients for free at four surgical camps in the northern Nigerian states of Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, and Sokoto. The initiative was collaborated by many partners such as the federal and state governments of Nigeria, 13 Nigerian fistula surgeons, the Nigerian Red Cross, and UNFPA. During the nine-month preparation period, facilities were renovated, equipment were provided, and staff were extensively trained to treat fistula. The goals of this initiative were to alleviate the backlog of patients waiting for surgery, provide treatment services at host sites, and to raise awareness for maternal health.

The Fistula Fortnight treated 569 women at no cost, with an 87.8% rate of successful closures. Follow-up treatments and services were provided, such as bed rest, analgesics, oral fluids, visual monitoring of urination by nurses, a catheter, catheter removal, and an examination and discharge from the hospital at a minimum of four weeks, with instruction to avoid sexual intercourse. The Fistula Fortnight also had preoperative and postoperative counseling provided by nurses and social workers and held health education workshops for fistula patients and their families.

=== Community organizations ===
People recovering from a fistula in the postoperative period need support to fully reintegrate into society. In particular, physical labor is limited in the first year of recovery, so women need alternative ways to earn an income. Since poverty is an indirect cause of obstetric fistulae, some community organizations aim to provide postoperative services to enhance the women&#x27;s socioeconomic situation. Delta Survie, located in Mopti, Mali, is a community center that provides skills training and helps women to produce hand-made jewelry to generate income and meet other women while they recover. Another organization, IAMANEH Suisse, identifies Malian fistula patients, facilitates operations for those without the financial means, and helps them access follow-up services to prevent recurrence of fistulae in their subsequent pregnancies.

Other organizations also help to arrange mission trips for medical personnel to visit countries with women affected by fistulae, perform surgeries, and train local doctors to give medical assistance for fistula patients. The International Organization for Women and Development (IOWD) is one such nonprofit organization. The IOWD hosts four to five mission trips per year to provide relief to obstetric fistula patients in West Africa. IOWD mission trip members have evaluated thousands of patients at no cost and performed surgeries for over a thousand women.

===Treatment centers===
A complete fistula treatment center includes investigative services like laboratory work, radiology, and a blood bank, to ensure that the medical history of patients is clearly understood before treatment options are evaluated. The surgical services would include operating theaters, postoperative wards, and anesthetic services. Physiotherapy and social-reintegration services are also necessary to arm women affected by obstetric fistula with the tools necessary to re-enter a society from which they have been ostracised. The size of the facility should be tailored to the need in the area, and the most successful centers work in collaboration with other treatment centers and organizations, forming a larger network of resources. The cost of salaries, single-use medical equipment, up to date technology and equipment, and maintenance of infrastructure, collectively provide large economic burdens to treatment centers. A barrier also arises when governments and local authorities require that approval be obtained prior to the construction of centers. There is an uneven distribution of specialized health care providers due to the below optimal training and supervision of health works and the low wages of fistula surgeons. Most fistula surgeons come from developed countries and are brought to developing countries, the nations more often affected by fistula, by a variety of organizations. An example of a well functioning treatment center is in Bangladesh where a facility has been created in association with the Dhaka Medical College Hospital with support from the United Nations Population Fund. Here, 46 doctors and 30 nurses have been trained and have successfully doubled the number of fistula cases addressed and operated on. Another example is a fistula unit in N&#x27;djamena, Chad, which has a mobile clinic that travels to rural, hard-to-reach areas, to provide services, and works in association with Liberty Hospital. The World Health Organization has created a manual articulating necessary principles for surgical and pre- and post- operative care regarding obstetric fistula, providing a beneficial outline for affected nations. Treatment centers are crucial for the survival of obstetric fistula patients and well-equipped centers help the emotional, physical, and psychological aspects of their lives.

<doc id="231287" wikidata="Q682710" url="?curid=231287" title="Extreme (band)">
<text>Extreme is an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1985, that reached the height of their popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They have released six studio albums, two EPs (in Japan) and two compilation albums since their formation. The band was one of the most successful rock acts of the early 1990s, selling over 10 million albums worldwide.

Extreme achieved their greatest success with their 1990 album &quot;Pornograffitti&quot;, which peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold in May 1991 and double platinum in October 1992. The album featured the acoustic ballad single &quot;More Than Words&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States.

==History==
===1985–1989: Formation and debut album===
Extreme was formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1985. Vocalist Gary Cherone and drummer Paul Geary were in a band together called &quot;Adrenalin&quot; in 1979. Then they were also members of a band called The Dream, in 1980. CBS Television bought the rights to the name, &quot;The Dream&quot; for a short lived television series called, &quot;Dreams.&quot; So, they had to rename the band. Guitarist Nuno Bettencourt was in a band called Sinful, and bassist Pat Badger was playing with a Berklee College-based act called In The Pink. Bettencourt joined Cherone and Geary in a new group in 1985, followed by Badger in 1986. The four chose the name &quot;Extreme&quot; as it sounded like &quot;ex-Dream,&quot; a reference to Geary &amp; Cherone&#x27;s past band, &quot;The Dream.&quot; Gary &amp; Nuno crossed paths numerous times as Gary&#x27;s brother Mark &amp; Nuno&#x27;s brother Paulo were in a well known local Boston band together called, &quot;Flesh.&quot; 

Cherone and Bettencourt began writing songs together and the band performed continuously in the New England area. Extreme grew a large regional following and were named &quot;Outstanding Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Act&quot; at the Boston Music Awards in 1986 and 1987.

The band had accumulated several original songs by the time A&amp;R director Bryan Huttenhower signed them to A&amp;M Records in 1987 (which was soon sold to PolyGram in 1988). The band recorded their self-titled debut album which was issued in March 1989. The first single was &quot;Kid Ego&quot;, a song that Cherone would later admit made him cringe. The final track on the album, &quot;Play with Me&quot;, was used as the &quot;mall chase&quot; song in the film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;.

===1990–1993: &quot;Pornograffitti&quot;, &quot;III Sides to Every Story&quot;, and mainstream success===
Sales of Extreme&#x27;s first record were sufficient to support a second release. Michael Wagener, who had previously worked with Dokken and White Lion, was hired to produce the band&#x27;s &quot;Extreme II: Pornograffitti&quot; album in 1990.

The record, which showcased Cherone&#x27;s lyrics, and Bettencourt&#x27;s guitar-playing, was a mixture of funk, pop and glam metal sounds. &quot;Decadence Dance&quot; and &quot;Get the Funk Out&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Get the Funk Out&quot; reached No. 19 in the UK charts in June 1991. Neither single was initially successful in the United States, however, and the album had fallen off the charts when A&amp;M sent the third single to a number of US radio stations.

The acoustic ballad &quot;More Than Words&quot; entered the Hot 100 on March 23, 1991, at No. 81. It later became a huge smash, hitting No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. The subsequent single, &quot;Hole Hearted&quot;, another acoustic track, was also successful, rising to No. 4 on the same pop chart.

The band began recording their third album in 1992. Their appearance at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in April 1992 interrupted the recording sessions, but it gave the band considerable exposure beyond the heavy metal fraternity. By playing a medley at the tribute, as well as &quot;Love of My Life&quot; and &quot;More Than Words&quot; acoustically, Extreme gained a considerable number of fans along with the Queen fan base. At the introductory speech before they played, Brian May noted that they were &quot;possibly more than any other group on this planet, the people that understand exactly what Queen have been about all these years, and what Freddie was about all these years&quot;.

&quot;III Sides to Every Story&quot; was released on September 22, 1992. The first single from the album, &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;, had an accompanying video clip inspired by a film short by the National Film Board of Canada called &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

===1994–1996: Lineup change and &quot;Waiting for the Punchline&quot;===
Prior to the band&#x27;s appearance at Donington&#x27;s Monsters of Rock festival in the summer of 1994, Geary left the band to pursue a career in artist management. Mike Mangini succeeded him on drums.

&quot;Waiting for the Punchline&quot;, the first record to feature Mangini on three tracks (Paul Geary played on the rest of the album before departing), was released on February 7, 1995. The singles &quot;Hip Today&quot;, &quot;Unconditionally&quot;, and &quot;Cynical&quot; were released, but the album was not a commercial sales success. Extreme disbanded after the tour in 1996, on amicable terms, when Bettencourt decided to leave to pursue a solo career.

===1997–2003: Split and separate projects===
On the recommendation of former Extreme manager Ray Danniels, in 1996, Gary Cherone joined one of the world&#x27;s most successful rock acts, Van Halen. During 1996, Van Halen&#x27;s fan-base weathered the acrimonious departures of two of rock&#x27;s most successful lead singers: first David Lee Roth, the band&#x27;s original frontman (1974-1985), and then Sammy Hagar, who had fronted Van Halen since 1985. Into this fractious, and very public, situation entered Cherone, whom guitarist Eddie Van Halen later called a &quot;musical soulmate&quot;. In 1998, the Cherone-fronted Van Halen released &quot;Van Halen III&quot;.

&quot;Van Halen III&quot; reached No. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top 200 album charts, and sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone; however, by Van Halen&#x27;s standards, it was a failure. All 12 of their previous albums had all sold over two million copies in the U.S. alone, with two selling over ten million in the U.S. alone—and the previous five studio albums had all reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts. Van Halen&#x27;s tour was successful; however, not as successful as in previous years.

In late 1999, after Van Halen&#x27;s second album with Cherone was &quot;sent back&quot; by Warner Bros. Records, Cherone left the band. He later formed Tribe of Judah, which released an album called &quot;Exit Elvis&quot; in 2002. In 2005, Cherone released a four-song sampler CD, entitled &quot;Need I Say More&quot;.

In 1997, Nuno Bettencourt released his first solo album titled &quot;Schizophonic&quot;. In 1998 he formed a group called Mourning Widows who released a self-titled album that year and a follow-up album, &quot;Furnished Souls for Rent&quot;, in 2000. Following the breakup of that band, he released another solo album under the project name of &quot;Population 1&quot; in 2002. Acquiring new members for the tour, he decided to keep the name Population 1 and the first release as a band was a five-song EP entitled &quot;Sessions from Room 4&quot; in 2004. They then changed the band&#x27;s name to DramaGods and created a follow-up CD entitled &quot;Love&quot; in 2005. Nuno, along with bandmates Kevin Figueiredo and Steve Ferlazzo, then went on to collaborate with Perry Farrell&#x27;s project Satellite Party.

&quot;The Best of Extreme: An Accidental Collocation of Atoms?&quot;, a 13-track Extreme &quot;best-of&quot; collection featuring tracks from the first three studio albums, was released in 1998. &quot;Extreme – The Collection&quot;, a later collection including 15-tracks from the first four studio albums, was released in 2002.

===2004–2010: Reformation and &quot;Saudades de Rock&quot;===

Extreme reformed for a short tour in 2004 playing in the Azores (August), in their hometown of Boston at the WAAF anniversary (September 19) as well as a few concerts in Japan (January 2005). After a hiatus during 2005, the band returned in 2006 with the &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Pornograffitti&quot; lineup (including Paul Geary) to do a small, three-show reunion tour through New England.

In July 2007, Bettencourt quit Satellite Party for another Extreme reunion with Cherone and Pat Badger. On November 26, 2007, the band announced plans for a world tour in the summer of 2008 with King&#x27;s X as well as a release date for their new album, &quot;Saudades de Rock&quot;, produced by Bettencourt. Kevin Figueiredo, who played with Bettencourt in DramaGods and Satellite Party, took over drum duties for the band. Original drummer Paul Geary would still remain involved with the band, albeit in a management position. Singles from the album have been available on MySpace including &quot;Star&quot;. The album was released on July 28, 2008, in France, August 4, 2008, in Europe, and August 12, 2008, in the United States.

The band then embarked on the Take Us Alive World Tour, supported by King&#x27;s X in the US and Hot Leg in the UK, with various other dates in Europe and Asia, through all of 2008. In 2009, the band continued to tour, co-headlining the East Meets West Tour with Ratt. The final date of this tour, in their hometown of Boston, Massachusetts, was recorded for the release of the band&#x27;s first live DVD called &quot;Take Us Alive&quot;.

===2010–2015: Hiatus, Hurtsmile, and other projects===
According to a December 2010 interview with Cherone, Extreme had been writing new material for a new album, which they planned - at the time - to release in 2011. Asked in the same interview if the band will produce the new album by themselves or get an outside producer, Cherone replied, &quot;There&#x27;s talk of a few people. It would be great to get an A-list name. I don&#x27;t know if that happens. My dream producer would probably be Rick Rubin. Here&#x27;s a guy that&#x27;s done Johnny Cash, the Chili Peppers, and, you know, Neil Diamond.&quot; But due to conflicting schedules with Bettencourt supporting Rihanna on her tour during 2011, plans to go into the studio were postponed to 2012.

Also in 2010 rumors started about possible commemorative shows for &quot;Extreme II: Pornograffitti&quot;, given the 20th anniversary of the record. Finally, in 2012, initially a small string of such shows in Japan had been confirmed, marking the full return of the band&#x27;s activities after a hiatus when Bettencourt was on tour with Rihanna, as well as other side projects by other members, most notably Cherone&#x27;s Hurtsmile. Extreme were to tour Australia in April 2013, with Richie Kotzen as support act, but the shows were cancelled due to scheduling conflicts with Rihanna&#x27;s 2013 North American tour. They then did their first show in Singapore.

===2015–present: &quot;Six&quot;===

In a May 2015 interview with Eddie Trunk, vocalist Gary Cherone said that Extreme had been writing and demoing new material for their follow-up to &quot;Saudades de Rock&quot;, and would enter the studio in the fall to begin recording.

In a September 2016 interview, guitarist Nuno Bettencourt revealed that Extreme had been working on approximately 17 songs for their new album, and added, &quot;We&#x27;re about 17 songs into it. We&#x27;re just wrapping them up. We&#x27;ve got to do vocals, some guitar. Slowly but surely.&quot; He also stated that the album was expected to be released in early 2017; however, this did not come to fruition and there had been no updates on the album until mid-2022, when Cherone reiterated the album&#x27;s slow progress in an interview with Eddie Trunk, and described the songs as &quot;some of the best stuff Nuno and [he] have written.&quot;

In 2016, the band released &quot;Pornograffitti Live 25: Metal Meltdown&quot;, an audio/video presentation of its 2015 concert at Las Vegas&#x27; Hard Rock Casino.

During the 2017 KISS Kruise, the band invited original drummer Paul Geary to join them on stage to play &quot;Hole Hearted&quot;.

In June 2018, Extreme toured Australia with Mr. Big, which marked the latter&#x27;s first tour of Australia and Extreme&#x27;s first tour of the continent since 1993. After their Australian tour, they went on to tour Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok and Taipei.

Extreme headlined Shirock 2019 alongside Scottish hard rock band Nazareth. On October 19, 2019, the band performed in India in front of over 30,000 fans in Ukhrul.

On February 17, 2023, the band began to release a different teaser each day, to end on February 28. On March 1, 2023, Extreme released the single &quot;Rise&quot; and announced that &quot;Six&quot; would be released on June 9 of the same year. On April 19, 2023, Extreme released the official videos for &quot;Banshee&quot; and &quot;#Rebel&quot; on their YouTube channel.

<doc id="231288" wikidata="Q650921" url="?curid=231288" title="Peristaltic pump">
<text>A peristaltic pump, also commonly known as a roller pump, is a type of positive displacement pump used for pumping a variety of fluids. The fluid is contained in a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing. Most peristaltic pumps work through rotary motion, though linear peristaltic pumps have also been made. The rotor has a number of &quot;wipers&quot; or &quot;rollers&quot; attached to its external circumference, which compress the flexible tube as they rotate by. The part of the tube under compression is closed, forcing the fluid to move through the tube. Additionally, as the tube opens to its natural state after the rollers pass, more fluid is drawn into the tube. This process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, there will be two or more rollers compressing the tube, trapping a body of fluid between them. The body of fluid is transported through the tube, toward the pump outlet. Peristaltic pumps may run continuously, or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid.

==History==

A form of peristaltic pump was described in &quot;The Mechanics Magazine&quot; in 1845. The pump used a leather hose which did not need to self-open when released by the rollers, instead relying on the incoming water having sufficient pressure to fill the open inlet end on each cycle. The peristaltic pump was first patented in the United States by Rufus Porter and J. D. Bradley in 1855 (U.S. Patent number 12753) as a well pump, and later by Eugene Allen in 1881 (U.S. Patent number 249285) for blood transfusions. It was developed by heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey for blood transfusions while he was a medical student in 1932 and later used by him for cardiopulmonary bypass systems. A specialized nonocclusive roller pump (US Patent 5222880) using soft flat tubing was developed in 1992 for cardiopulmonary bypass systems.

==Applications==
Peristaltic pumps are typically used to pump clean/sterile or highly reactive fluids without exposing those fluids to contamination from exposed pump components. Some common applications include pumping IV fluids through an infusion device, apheresis, highly reactive chemicals, high-solids slurries, and other materials where isolation of the product from the environment are critical. They are also used in heart–lung machines to circulate blood during bypass surgery, and in hemodialysis systems, since the pump does not cause significant hemolysis, or rupture of the blood cells.

==Key design parameters==

The ideal peristaltic pump should have an infinite diameter of the pump head and the largest possible diameter of the rollers. Such an ideal peristaltic pump would offer the longest possible tubing lifetime and provide a constant and pulsation-free flow rate.

Such an ideal peristaltic pump cannot be constructed in reality. However, peristaltic pumps can be designed to approach these ideal peristaltic pump parameters.

Careful design can offer constant accurate flow rates for several weeks together with a long tubing lifetime without the risk of tubing rupture.

===Chemical compatibility===
The pumped fluid contacts only the inside surface of the tubing. This eliminates fluid compatibility concerns with other pump components such as valves, O-rings, and seals, which must be considered for other pump designs. Therefore, only the composition of the tubing that the pumped medium travels through is considered for chemical compatibility.

The tubing needs to be elastomeric to maintain the circular cross-section after millions of cycles of squeezing in the pump. This requirement eliminates a variety of non-elastomeric polymers that have compatibility with a wide range of chemicals, such as PTFE, polyolefins, PVDF, etc. from consideration as material for pump tubing. The popular elastomers for pump tubing are nitrile (NBR), Hypalon, Viton, silicone, PVC, EPDM, EPDM+polypropylene (as in Santoprene), polyurethane and natural rubber. Of these materials, natural rubber has the best fatigue resistance, and EPDM and Hypalon have the best chemical compatibility. Silicone is popular with water-based fluids, such as in bio-pharma industry, but has a limited range of chemical compatibility in other industries.

Extruded fluoropolymer tubes such as FKM (Viton, Fluorel, etc.) have good compatibility with acids, hydrocarbons, and petroleum fuels, but have insufficient fatigue resistance to achieve an effective tube life.

There are a couple of newer tubing developments that offer broad chemical compatibility using lined tubing and fluoroelastomers.

With lined tubing, the thin inside liner is made of a chemically resistant material such as poly-olefin and PTFE that forms a barrier for the rest of the tubing wall from coming in contact with the pumped fluid. These liners are materials that are often not elastomeric, therefore the entire tube wall cannot be made with this material for peristaltic pump applications. This tubing provides adequate chemical compatibility and life to be used in chemically challenging applications. There are a few things to keep in mind when using these tubes - any pinholes in the liner during manufacturing could render the tubing vulnerable to chemical attack. In the case of stiff plastic liners like the polyolefins, with repeated flexing in the peristaltic pump they can develop cracks, rendering the bulk material again vulnerable to chemical attack. A common issue with all lined tubing is the delamination of the liner with repeated flexing that signals the end of the tube&#x27;s life. For those with the need for chemically compatible tubing, these lined tubings offer a good solution.

With fluoroelastomer tubing, the elastomer itself has the chemical resistance. In the case of e.g. Chem-Sure, it is made of a perfluoroelastomer, that has the broadest chemical compatibility of all elastomers. The two fluoroelastomer tubes listed above combine the chemical compatibility with a very long tube life stemming from their reinforcement technology but come at a pretty high initial cost. One has to justify the cost with the total value derived over the long tube life and compare with other options such as other tubing or even other pump technologies.

There are many online sites for checking the chemical compatibility of the tubing material with the pumped fluid. The tubing manufacturers may also have compatibility charts specific to their tubing production method, coating, material, and the fluid being pumped.

While these charts cover a list of commonly encountered fluids, they may not have all the fluids. If there is a fluid whose compatibility is not listed anywhere, then a common test of compatibility is the immersion testing. A 1 to 2 inch sample of the tubing is immersed in the fluid to be pumped for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours, and the amount of weight change from before and after the immersion is measured. If the weight change is greater than 10% of the initial weight, then that tube is not compatible with the fluid, and should not be used in that application. This test is still a one-way test, in the sense that there is still a remote chance that the tubing that passes this test can still be incompatible for the application since the combination of borderline compatibility and mechanical flexing can push the tube over the edge, resulting in premature tube failure.

In general, recent tubing developments have brought broad chemical compatibility to the peristaltic pump option that many chemical dosing applications can benefit over other current pump technologies.

===Occlusion===

The minimum gap between the roller and the housing determines the maximum squeeze applied on the tubing. The amount of squeeze applied to the tubing affects pumping performance and the tube life more squeezing decreases the tubing life dramatically, while less squeezing can cause the pumped medium to slip back, especially in high-pressure pumping, and decreases the efficiency of the pump dramatically, and the high velocity of the slip-back typically causes premature failure of the hose. Therefore, this amount of squeeze becomes an important design parameter.

The term &quot;occlusion&quot; is used to measure the amount of squeeze. It is either expressed as a percentage of twice the wall thickness, or as an absolute amount of the wall that is squeezed.

Let
: &quot;g&quot; = minimum gap between the roller and the housing,
: &quot;t&quot; = wall thickness of the tubing.

Then
: &quot;y&quot; = 2&quot;t&quot; − &quot;g&quot;, when expressed as the absolute amount of squeeze,
: &quot;y&quot; = 100% × (2&quot;t&quot; − &quot;g&quot;) / (2&quot;t&quot;), when expressed as a percentage of twice the wall thickness.

The occlusion is typically 10% to 20%, with a higher occlusion for a softer tube material, and a lower occlusion for a harder tube material.

Thus for a given pump, the most critical tubing dimension becomes the wall thickness. An interesting point here is that the inside diameter (ID) of the tubing is not an important design parameter for the suitability of the tubing for the pump. Therefore, it is common for more than one ID be used with a pump, as long as the wall thickness remains the same.

===Inside diameter===
For a given rotational speed of the pump, a tube with a larger inside diameter (ID) will give a higher flow rate than one with a smaller inside diameter. The flow rate is a function of the cross-section area of the tube bore.

=== Flow rate ===
The flow rate is an important parameter for a pump. The flow rate in a peristaltic pump is determined by many factors, such as:
# Tube inner diameter higher flow rate with larger inner diameter.
# Pump-head outer diameter higher flow rate with larger outer diameter.
# Pump-head rotational speed higher flow rate with higher speed.
# Inlet pulsation the pulse reduces the filling volume of the hose.

Increasing the number of rollers does not increase the flow rate, instead it will decrease the flow rate somewhat by reducing the effective (i.e. fluid-pumping) circumference of the head. Adding rollers does tend to decrease the amplitude of the fluid pulsing at the outlet by increasing the frequency of the pulsed flow.

The length of the tube (measured from the initial pinch point near the inlet to the final release point near the outlet) does not affect the flow rate. However, a longer tube implies more pinch points between inlet and outlet, increasing the pressure that the pump can generate.

The flow rate of a peristaltic pump is in most cases not linear. The effect of pulsation at the inlet of the pump changes the filling degree of the peristaltic hose. With high inlet pulsation, the peristaltic hose may become oval-shaped, resulting in less flow.
Accurate metering with a peristaltic pump is therefore only possible when the pump has a constant flow rate, or when inlet pulsation is eliminated with the use of correctly designed pulsation dampeners.

===Pulsation===
Pulsation is an important side effect of the peristaltic pump. The pulsation in a peristaltic pump is determined by many factors, such as:
# Flow rate higher flow rate gives more pulsation.
# Line length Long pipelines give more pulsation.
# Higher pump speed higher rotational frequency gives more pulsation.
# Specific gravity of the fluid higher fluid density gives more pulsation.

==Variations==

===Hose pumps===
Higher pressure peristaltic hose pumps which can typically operate against up to in continuous service, use shoes (rollers only used on low-pressure types) and have casings filled with lubricant to prevent abrasion of the exterior of the pump tube and to aid in the dissipation of heat, and use reinforced tubes, often called &quot;hoses&quot;. This class of pump is often called a &quot;hose pump&quot;.

The biggest advantage with the hose pumps over the roller pumps is the high operating pressure of up to 16 bar. With rollers, max pressure can arrive up to without any problem. If the high operating pressure is not required, a tubing pump is a better option than a hose pump if the pumped medium is not abrasive. With recent advances made in the tubing technology for pressure, life, and chemical compatibility, as well as the higher flow rate ranges, the advantages that hose pumps had over roller pumps continues to erode.

===Tube pumps===
Lower pressure peristaltic pumps typically have dry casings and use rollers along with non-reinforced, extruded tubing. This class of pump is sometimes called a &quot;tube pump&quot; or &quot;tubing pump&quot;. These pumps employ rollers to squeeze the tube. Except for a 360° eccentric pump design, these pumps have a minimum of 2 rollers 180° apart and may have as many as 8, or even 12 rollers. Increasing the number of rollers increases the pressure pulse frequency of the pumped fluid at the outlet, thereby decreasing the amplitude of pulsing. The downside to increasing the number of rollers it that it proportionately increases the number of squeezes, or occlusions, on the tubing for a given cumulative flow through that tube, thereby reducing the tubing life.

There are two kinds of roller design in peristaltic pumps:
* Fixed occlusion - In this kind of pump, the rollers have a fixed locus as it turns, keeping the occlusion constant as it squeezes the tube. This is a simple, yet effective design. The only downside to this design is that the occlusion as a percent on the tube varies with the variation of the tube wall thickness. Typically the wall thickness of the extruded tubes varies enough that the % occlusion can vary with the wall thickness (see above). Therefore, a section of tube with greater wall thickness, but within the accepted tolerance, will have higher percent occlusion, which increases the wear on the tubing, thereby decreasing the tube life. Tube wall thickness tolerances today are generally kept tight enough that this issue is not of much practical concern. For those mechanically inclined, this may be the constant strain operation.
* Spring-loaded rollers - As the name indicates, the rollers in this pump are mounted on a spring. This design is more elaborate than the fixed occlusion, but helps overcome the variations in the tube wall thickness over a broader range. Regardless of the variations, the roller imparts the same amount of stress on the tubing that is proportional to the spring constant, making this a constant stress operation. The spring is selected to overcome not only the hoop strength of the tubing, but also the pressure of the pumped fluid.

The operating pressure of these pumps is determined by the tubing and by the motor&#x27;s ability to overcome the hoop strength of the tubing and the fluid pressure.

===Microfluidic pumps===

In microfluidics, it is often desirable to minimize the circulating volume of fluid. Traditional pumps require a large volume of liquid external to the microfluidic circuit. This can lead to problems due to dilution of analytes and already dilute biological signalling molecules.
For this reason, among others, it is desirable to integrate a micro-pumping structure into the microfluidic circuit. &quot;Wu et al.&quot; presented in 2008 a pneumatically actuated peristaltic micropump which eliminates the need for large external circulating fluid volumes.

==Advantages==
* No contamination. Because the only part of the pump in contact with the fluid being pumped is the interior of the tube, it is easy to sterilize and clean the inside surfaces of the pump.
* Low maintenance needs and easy to clean; their lack of valves, seals and glands makes them comparatively inexpensive to maintain.
* They are able to handle slurries, viscous, shear-sensitive and aggressive fluids.
* Pump design prevents backflow and siphoning without valves.
* A fixed amount of fluid is pumped per rotation, so it can be used to roughly measure the amount of pumped fluid.

==Disadvantages==
* The flexible tubing will tend to degrade with time and require periodic replacement.
* The flow is pulsed, particularly at low rotational speeds. Therefore, these pumps are less suitable where a smooth consistent flow is required. In applications that require smooth flow, an alternative type of positive displacement pump should then be considered.
* Effectiveness is limited by liquid viscosity
* Decreasing potential flow rates with increasing overall lift on intake side, with a maximum theoretical lift of 33 feet

==Tubing==
Considerations for selecting peristaltic pump tubing include appropriate chemical resistance towards the liquid being pumped, whether the pump will be used continuously or intermittently, and cost. Types of tubing commonly used in peristaltic pumps include:
* Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
* Silicone rubber
* Fluoropolymer
* PharMed
* Thermoplastic
* Fluoroelastomer
For continuous use, most of the materials perform similarly over short time frames. This suggests that overlooked low cost materials such as PVC might meet the needs of a short-term, one time use medical applications. For intermittent use, compression set is important and Silicone is an optimal material choice.

<text>A ball grid array (BGA) is a type of surface-mount packaging (a chip carrier) used for integrated circuits. BGA packages are used to permanently mount devices such as microprocessors. A BGA can provide more interconnection pins than can be put on a dual in-line or flat package. The whole bottom surface of the device can be used, instead of just the perimeter. The traces connecting the package&#x27;s leads to the wires or balls which connect the die to package are also on average shorter than with a perimeter-only type, leading to better performance at high speeds.

Soldering of BGA devices requires precise control and is usually done by automated processes such as in computer-controlled automatic reflow ovens.

== Description ==

The BGA is descended from the pin grid array (PGA), which is a package with one face covered (or partly covered) with pins in a grid pattern which, in operation, conduct electrical signals between the integrated circuit and the printed circuit board (PCB) on which it is placed. In a BGA the pins are replaced by pads on the bottom of the package, each initially with a tiny solder ball stuck to it. These solder spheres can be placed manually or by automated equipment, and are held in place with a tacky flux. The device is placed on a PCB with copper pads in a pattern that matches the solder balls. The assembly is then heated, either in a reflow oven or by an infrared heater, melting the balls. Surface tension causes the molten solder to hold the package in alignment with the circuit board, at the correct separation distance, while the solder cools and solidifies, forming soldered connections between the device and the PCB.

In more advanced technologies, solder balls may be used on both the PCB and the package. Also, in stacked multi-chip modules, (package on package) solder balls are used to connect two packages.

== Advantages ==

=== High density ===
The BGA is a solution to the problem of producing a miniature package for an integrated circuit with many hundreds of pins. Pin grid arrays and dual-in-line surface mount (SOIC) packages were being produced with more and more pins, and with decreasing spacing between the pins, but this was causing difficulties for the soldering process. As package pins got closer together, the danger of accidentally bridging adjacent pins with solder grew.

=== Heat conduction ===
A further advantage of BGA packages over packages with discrete leads (i.e. packages with legs) is the lower thermal resistance between the package and the PCB. This allows heat generated by the integrated circuit inside the package to flow more easily to the PCB, preventing the chip from overheating.

=== Low-inductance leads ===
The shorter an electrical conductor, the lower its unwanted inductance, a property which causes unwanted distortion of signals in high-speed electronic circuits. BGAs, with their very short distance between the package and the PCB, have low lead inductances, giving them superior electrical performance to pinned devices.

== Disadvantages ==
=== Lack of compliance===
A disadvantage of BGAs is that the solder balls cannot flex in the way that longer leads can, so they are not mechanically compliant. As with all surface mount devices, bending due to a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between PCB substrate and BGA (thermal stress) or flexing and vibration (mechanical stress) can cause the solder joints to fracture.

Thermal expansion issues can be overcome by matching the mechanical and thermal characteristics of the PCB to those of the package. Typically, plastic BGA devices more closely match PCB thermal characteristics than ceramic devices.

The predominant use of RoHS compliant lead-free solder alloy assemblies has presented some further challenges to BGAs including &quot;head in pillow&quot; soldering phenomenon, &quot;pad cratering&quot; problems as well as their decreased reliability versus lead-based solder BGAs in extreme operating conditions such as high temperature, high thermal shock and high gravitational force environments, in part due to lower ductility of RoHS-compliant solders.

Mechanical stress issues can be overcome by bonding the devices to the board through a process called &quot;underfilling&quot;, which injects an epoxy mixture under the device after it is soldered to the PCB, effectively gluing the BGA device to the PCB. There are several types of underfill materials in use with differing properties relative to workability and thermal transfer. An additional advantage of underfill is that it limits tin whisker growth.

Another solution to non-compliant connections is to put a &quot;compliant layer&quot; in the package that allows the balls to physically move in relation to the package. This technique has become standard for packaging DRAMs in BGA packages.

Other techniques for increasing the board-level reliability of packages include use of low-expansion PCBs for ceramic BGA (CBGA) packages, interposers between the package and PCB, and re-packaging a device.

===Difficulty of inspection===
Once the package is soldered into place, it is difficult to find soldering faults. X-ray machines, industrial CT scanning machines, special microscopes, and endoscopes to look underneath the soldered package have been developed to overcome this problem. If a BGA is found to be badly soldered, it can be removed in a &quot;rework station&quot;, which is a jig fitted with infrared lamp (or hot air), a thermocouple and a vacuum device for lifting the package. The BGA can be replaced with a new one, or it can be refurbished (or &quot;reballed&quot;) and re-installed on the circuit board. Pre-configured solder balls matching the array pattern can be used to reball BGAs when only one or a few need to be reworked. For higher volume and repeated lab work, a stencil-configured vacuum-head pick-up and placement of loose spheres can be used.

Due to the cost of visual X-ray BGA inspection, electrical testing is very often used instead. Very common is boundary scan testing using an IEEE 1149.1 JTAG port.

A cheaper and easier inspection method, albeit destructive, is becoming increasingly popular because it does not require special equipment. Commonly referred to as dye and pry, the process includes immersing the entire PCB or just the BGA attached module into a dye, and after drying, the module is pried off and the broken joins are inspected. If a solder location contains the dye, then it indicates that the connection was imperfect.

=== Difficulties during circuit development ===
During development it is not practical to solder BGAs into place, and sockets are used instead, but tend to be unreliable. There are two common types of socket: the more reliable type has spring pins that push up under the balls, although it does not allow using BGAs with the balls removed as the spring pins may be too short.

The less reliable type is a ZIF socket, with spring pinchers that grab the balls. This does not work well, especially if the balls are small.

=== Cost of equipment ===
Expensive equipment is required to reliably solder BGA packages; hand-soldering BGA packages is very difficult and unreliable, usable only for the smallest packages in the smallest quantities. However, as more ICs have become available only in leadless (e.g. quad-flat no-leads package) or BGA packages, various DIY reflow methods have been developed using inexpensive heat sources such as heat guns, and domestic toaster ovens and electric skillets.

Effectively also the flip chip methods for mounting chip dies to a carrier is sort of a BGA design derivate with the functional equivalent of the balls there being called bumps or micro bumps. This is realized at an already microscopic size level.

To make it easier to use ball grid array devices, most BGA packages only have balls in the outer rings of the package,
leaving the innermost square empty.

Intel used a package designated BGA1 for their Pentium II and early Celeron mobile processors. BGA2 is Intel&#x27;s package for their Pentium III and some later Celeron mobile processors. BGA2 is also known as FCBGA-479. It replaced its predecessor, BGA1.

For example, the &quot;micro-FCBGA&quot; (flip chip ball grid array) is Intel&#x27;s current BGA mounting method for mobile processors that use a flip chip binding technology. It was introduced with the &quot;Coppermine&quot; Mobile Celeron. Micro-FCBGA has 479 balls that are 0.78 mm in diameter. The processor is affixed to the motherboard by soldering the balls to the motherboard. This is thinner than a pin grid array socket arrangement, but is not removable.

The 479 balls of the Micro-FCBGA package (a package almost identical to the 478-pin socketable micro-FCPGA package) are arranged as the 6 outer rings of a 1.27 mm pitch (20 balls per inch pitch) 26x26 square grid, with the inner 14x14 region empty.

== Procurement ==
Primary end-users of BGAs are original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). There is also a market among electronic hobbyists do it yourself (DIY) such as the increasingly popular maker movement. While OEMs generally source their components from the manufacturer, or the manufacturer&#x27;s distributor, the hobbyist will typically obtain BGAs on the aftermarket through electronic component brokers or distributors.

<text>Roadmarks is a science fantasy novel by American author Roger Zelazny, written during the late 1970s and published in 1979.

==Structure and characters==
The novel postulates a road that travels through time, with a nexus placed every few years where a handful of specially gifted people are able to get on and off. The plot involves a series of assassination attempts on the protagonist, with short vignettes on each of the would-be assassins.

The book has two poetry collections as characters. &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot; by Charles Baudelaire and &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; by Walt Whitman appear as cybernetic extensions of themselves. They are companions of the protagonist and his son Randy, and referred to as &quot;Flowers&quot; and &quot;Leaves&quot; respectively. They talk, argue and frequently quote their own content, exhibiting human-like levels of intelligence.

The novel alternates between non-linear &quot;Two&quot; and linear &quot;One&quot; chapters. According to Zelazny:

I did not decide until I was well into the book that since there was really two time-situations being dealt with (on-Road and off-Road—with off-Road being anywhen in history), I needed only two chapter headings, One and Two, to let the reader know where we are. And since the Twos were non-linear, anyway, I clipped each Two chapter into a discrete packet, stacked them and then shuffled them before reinserting them between the Ones. It shouldn&#x27;t have made any difference, though I wouldn&#x27;t have had the guts to try doing that without my experience with my other experimental books and the faith it had given me in the feelings I&#x27;d developed toward narrative.&quot;

The book&#x27;s editor was confused by the &quot;Two&quot; chapters and required Zelazny to rearrange the order of a few of them before publication.

==Plot summary==
The central theme of the novel is time travel using a highway that links all times and all possible histories. Exits from the highway lead to different times and places. Changing events in the past cause some exits further up the road, in the future, to become overgrown and inaccessible and new exits to appear, leading to different alternative futures.

The narrator and protagonist, Red Dorakeen, has vague memories of a place or time that is no longer accessible from the Road. He runs guns to the Greeks at Marathon, trying to recreate history as he remembers it in an attempt to open a new exit from the Road to his half-remembered place. The phrase &quot;Last Exit to Babylon&quot; was the manuscript title of the book and appears on the cover art; it was later used as a title for Volume Four in the &quot;Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny.&quot;

All &quot;One&quot; chapters feature Red Dorakeen, and all &quot;Two&quot; chapters feature secondary characters. These are Red&#x27;s natural son Randy, newly introduced to the Road and tired of his old life in Ohio; a series of potential assassins attempting to kill Red, some of whom are comic references to pulp characters or real people; and Leila, a woman whose destiny is closely connected to Red&#x27;s.

The &quot;One&quot; storyline is fairly linear, but the &quot;Two&quot; storyline jumps around in time and sequence, first introducing Randy and Leila without introduction, then later showing Randy&#x27;s introduction to the Road and meeting with Leila, who will/has just abandoned Red following an incident in the &quot;One&quot; timeline. The narrative becomes clear in the final chapter.

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Roadmarks&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #5, commenting that &quot;&quot;Roadmarks&quot; is a fun book – and, from anyone but Zelazny, it would be considered a &quot;tour de force&quot;. Its major difficulty would seem to be that Zelazny tried to force too many ideas into a length unsuited for them, thus being unable to exploit all of those ideas to satisfying fullness.&quot;

<text>Thomas Campbell (27 July 1777 – 15 June 1844) was a Scottish poet. He was a founder and the first President of the Clarence Club and a co-founder of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland; he was also one of the initiators of a plan to found what became University College London. In 1799 he wrote &quot;Pleasures of Hope&quot;, a traditional 18th-century didactic poem in heroic couplets. He also produced several patriotic war songs— &quot;Ye Mariners of England&quot;, &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Hohenlinden&quot; and, in 1801, &quot;The Battle of the Baltic&quot;, but was no less at home in delicate lyrics such as &quot;At Love&#x27;s Beginning&quot;.

==Early life==

Born on High Street, Glasgow in 1777, he was the youngest of the eleven children of Alexander Campbell (1710–1801), son of the 6th and last Laird of Kirnan, Argyll, descended from the MacIver-Campbells. His mother, Margaret (born 1736), was the daughter of John Campbell of Craignish and Mary, daughter of Robert Simpson, &quot;a celebrated Royal Armourer&quot;.

In about 1737, his father went to Falmouth, Virginia as a merchant in business with his wife&#x27;s brother Daniel Campbell, becoming a Tobacco Lord trading between there and Glasgow. They enjoyed a long period of prosperity until he lost his property and their old and respectable firm collapsed in consequence of the American Revolutionary War. Having personally lost nearly £20,000, Campbell&#x27;s father was nearly ruined. Several of Thomas&#x27; brothers remained in Virginia, one of whom married a daughter of Patrick Henry.

Both his parents were intellectually inclined, his father being a close friend of Thomas Reid (for whom Campbell was named) while his mother was known for her refined taste and love of literature and music. Thomas Campbell was educated at the High School of Glasgow and the University of Glasgow, where he won prizes for classics and verse-writing. He spent the holidays as a tutor in the western Highlands and his poems &quot;Glenara&quot; and the &quot;Ballad of Lord Ullin&#x27;s Daughter&quot; were written during this time while visiting the Isle of Mull.

In 1797, Campbell travelled to University of Edinburgh to attend lectures on law. He continued to support himself as a tutor and through his writing, aided by Robert Anderson, the editor of the British Poets. Among his contemporaries in Edinburgh were Sir Walter Scott, Henry Brougham, Francis Jeffrey, Thomas Brown, John Leyden and James Grahame. These early days in Edinburgh influenced such works as &quot;The Wounded Hussar&quot;, &quot;The Dirge of Wallace&quot; and the &quot;Epistle to Three Ladies&quot;.

== Career ==
In 1799, six months after the publication of the &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; of Wordsworth and Coleridge, &quot;The Pleasures of Hope&quot; was published. It is a rhetorical and didactic poem in the taste of his time, and owed much to the fact that it dealt with topics near to men&#x27;s hearts, with the French Revolution, the partition of Poland and with negro slavery. Its success was instantaneous, but Campbell was deficient in energy and perseverance and did not follow it up. He went abroad in June 1800 without any very definite aim, visited Gottlieb Friedrich Klopstock at Hamburg, and made his way to Regensburg, which was taken by the French three days after his arrival. He found refuge in a Scottish monastery. Some of his best lyrics, &quot;Hohenlinden&quot;, &quot;Ye Mariners of England&quot; and &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Dream&quot; (which was later set by Beethoven), belong to his German tour. He spent the winter in Altona, where he met an Irish exile, Anthony McCann, whose history suggested &quot;The Exile of Erin&quot;.

He had at that time the intention of writing an epic on Edinburgh to be entitled &quot;The Queen of the North&quot;. On the outbreak of war between Denmark and England he hurried home, the &quot;Battle of the Baltic&quot; being drafted soon after. At Edinburgh he was introduced to the first Lord Minto, who took him in the next year to London as occasional secretary. In June 1803 appeared a new edition of the &quot;Pleasures of Hope&quot;, to which some lyrics were added.

In 1803 Campbell married his second cousin, Matilda Sinclair, and settled in London. He was well received in Whig society, especially at Holland House. His prospects, however, were slight when in 1805 he received a government pension of £200. In that year the Campbells removed to Peak Hill, Sydenham. Campbell was at this time regularly employed on the &quot;Star&quot; newspaper, for which he translated the foreign news. In 1809 he published a narrative poem in the Spenserian stanza, &quot;Gertrude of Wyoming&quot; – referring to the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania and the Wyoming Valley Massacre – with which were printed some of his best lyrics. He was slow and fastidious in composition, and the poem suffered from overelaboration. Francis Jeffrey wrote to the author:

&quot;Your timidity or fastidiousness, or some other knavish quality, will not let you give your conceptions glowing, and bold, and powerful, as they present themselves; but you must chasten, and refine, and soften them, forsooth, till half their nature and grandeur is chiselled away from them. Believe me, the world will never know how truly you are a great and original poet till you venture to cast before it some of the rough pearls of your fancy.&quot;
In 1812 he delivered a series of lectures on poetry in London at the Royal Institution; and he was urged by Sir Walter Scott to become a candidate for the chair of literature at Edinburgh University. In 1814 he went to Paris, making there the acquaintance of the elder Schlegel, of Baron Cuvier and others. His pecuniary anxieties were relieved in 1815 by a legacy of £4000. He continued to occupy himself with his &quot;Specimens of the British Poets&quot;, the design of which had been projected years before. The work was published in 1819. It contains a selection with short lives of the poets, and prefixed to it a critical essay on poetry. In 1820 he accepted the editorship of the &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot;, and in the same year made another tour in Germany. Four years later appeared his &quot;Theodric&quot;, a not very successful poem of domestic life.

==Later life==

Campbell took an active share in the foundation of University College London (originally known as London University), visiting Berlin to inquire into the German system of education, and making recommendations which were adopted by Lord Brougham. He was elected Lord Rector of Glasgow University (1826–1829) in competition against Sir Walter Scott. Campbell retired from the editorship of the &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot; in 1830, and a year later made an unsuccessful venture with &quot;The Metropolitan Magazine&quot;. He had championed the cause of the Poles in &quot;The Pleasures of Hope&quot;, and the news of the capture of Warsaw by the Russians in 1831 affected him as if it had been the deepest of personal calamities. &quot;Poland preys on my heart night and day,&quot; he wrote in one of his letters, and his sympathy found a practical expression in the foundation in London of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland. In 1834 he travelled to Paris and Algiers, where he wrote his &quot;Letters from the South&quot; (printed 1837).

His wife died in 1828. Of his two sons, one died in infancy and the other became insane. His own health suffered, and he gradually withdrew from public life. He died at Boulogne on 15 June 1844 and was buried on 3 July 1844 Westminster Abbey at Poet&#x27;s Corner.

Campbell&#x27;s other works include a &quot;Life of Mrs Siddons&quot; (1834), and a narrative poem, &quot;The Pilgrim of Glencoe&quot; (1842).

<text>Lord of Light (1967) is a science fantasy novel by American author Roger Zelazny. It was awarded the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and nominated for a Nebula Award in the same category. Two chapters from the novel were published as novelettes in the &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; – &quot;Dawn&quot; in April 1967, and &quot;Death and the Executioner&quot; in June 1967.

Zelazny noted that &quot;Lord of Light&quot; was written so that it could be taken as a science fiction or a fantasy novel. The context of the novel is modern western characters in a Hindu-Buddhist-influenced world.

== Plot summary ==

&quot;Lord of Light&quot; is set on a planet colonized by remnants of Earth from a spaceship called the &quot;Star of India&quot;. To increase their chances of survival, the crew has used chemical treatments, biofeedback and electronics to mutate their minds and create enhanced self-images, or &quot;Aspects&quot;, that let them channel their powers. The crew has also developed a technology to transfer a person&#x27;s &quot;atman&quot;, or soul, electronically to a new body. This reincarnation by mind transfer has created a race of potential immortals and allowed the former crew members to institute the Hindu caste system, with themselves at the top.

The crew has used their now-great powers to control the native non-human races (whom they characterize as demons) while setting themselves up as gods in the eyes of the many generations of colonist progeny. Taking on the powers and names of Hindu deities, these &quot;gods&quot; maintain respect and control of the masses by maintaining a stranglehold on the access to reincarnation and by suppressing any technological advancements beyond a medieval level. The gods fear that any enlightenment or advancement might lead to a technological renaissance that would eventually weaken their power.

The protagonist, Sam, who has developed the ability to manipulate electromagnetic forces, is a renegade crewman who has rejected godhood, taking for himself the role of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha. Sam is the last &quot;Accelerationist&quot;: He believes that technology should be available to the masses, and that reincarnation should not be controlled by the elite. Sam introduces Buddhism to defeat the power of the gods with this &quot;new&quot; religion. His carefully planned revolt against the gods takes place in stages: &quot;An army, great in space, may offer opposition in a brief span of time. One man, brief in space, must spread his opposition across a period of many years if he is to have a chance of succeeding.&quot;

=== Stories ===
# In a monastery, the deathgod Yama – assisted by Tak the ape (formerly Tak the Archivist for the gods) and Ratri, Goddess of Night – assembles a clandestine radio transceiver to extract Sam&#x27;s &quot;atman&quot;, or soul, from the &quot;Bridge of the Gods&quot;, the planet&#x27;s ring system, and restore it to a body. Sam&#x27;s bodiless essence was projected by the gods into that structure after his capture in the battle of Keenset. This mode of execution was used because the last time the gods killed his body, Sam returned and stole a new one from one of the lesser gods. When Sam awakes, he claims to be horrified to be back in the flesh, having been aware of his ethereal condition the whole time, and having experienced it as a blissful Nirvana. He wants to return, to &quot;hear the song the stars sing on the shores of the great sea&quot;. Eventually, after meditation on and immersion in earthly senses, he returns fully to the world. Shortly after, an encounter with the god Mara, who had come to investigate the disturbances caused by Yama&#x27;s machinery, causes the conspirators to flee. As they proceed, Sam muses on his past.
# Prince Siddhartha, entering old age, comes down to the city of Mahartha to obtain a new body. He finds that there have been political and religious changes while he has lived on his estates. Before getting the body, he must submit to a mind-probe, operated by the &quot;Masters of Karma&quot;, which will be used to determine his fitness for reincarnation. Those judged unfit are given diseased bodies or even reincarnated as animals such as dogs. The dogs then act as spies for the Masters. Siddhartha contacts Jan Olvegg, former captain of the &quot;Star of India&quot;, and reveals himself as Sam. He talks via a videoscreen with the current Brahma, and sees that Brahma—who he remembers was originally a woman named Madeleine, incarnated into a male body—cannot stop acting like a God, even seeming to believe it himself when he begins to &#x27;curse&#x27; Sam. After this Sam cannot remain passive, and must proceed against the Gods. He raids the House of Karma, steals bodies for himself, Olvegg, and others, and causes the former Chief Master of Karma to be reincarnated as a dog. He then disappears to execute the next stage of his plan.
# The Buddha appears, preaching a philosophy of non-violence that undermines the doctrine of obedience to the gods and the struggle for a better rebirth. Instead, he emphasizes the pursuit of Nirvana and release from the illusion of the world. The goddess Kali, realizing that this is Sam&#x27;s work, sends her personal executioner, Rild, to kill Sam, but Rild falls ill and is found and tended to by the Buddhist acolytes, as well as by Sam himself. Because he owes Sam his life, Rild renounces his mission after he recovers. He becomes one of Sam&#x27;s disciples, eventually exceeding his teacher&#x27;s wisdom. He takes the name Sugata, preaching in earnest what Sam had done only calculatingly as a way to overthrow the gods. Yama descends to kill Sam. Sugata/Rild faces Yama on a treetrunk bridge over a river, knowing he cannot defeat the God of Death, but fighting him anyway. Yama kills Rild and proceeds to find Sam. However, Sam tricks Yama and escapes, promising to return with &quot;new weapons&quot;. Sam also warns Yama against the machinations of Yama&#x27;s beloved Kali, and in so doing makes a personal enemy of Yama.
# Sam enters Hellwell, a huge pit where he had bound the demons centuries earlier. He negotiates with their leader, Taraka, for allies in his struggle. He frees Taraka to see the world above, but Taraka betrays him by taking possession of Sam&#x27;s body, promising to resume the bargain &quot;later&quot;. While in control of Sam&#x27;s body, Taraka deposes a local maharajah and takes over his palace and harem. As Sam recovers control of his body, he finds himself becoming more like Taraka, enjoying the pleasures of the flesh. In turn, Taraka takes on some aspects of Sam, and ceases to revel in his life of pleasure. Sam tells him he has suffered the &quot;Curse of the Buddha&quot;, which is revealed to be a conscience and guilt. Soon after, Agni, God of Fire, arrives to kill Sam, finding instead two spirits in one body. Agni destroys the palace, while Sam/Taraka flees to Hellwell. They decide to free as many demons as possible before the gods arrive. However, even the full might of all the demons of Hellwell cannot stand against the gods. A mere four of the gods, Yama, Kali, Shiva, and Agni, are able to hold off the demons and pursue Sam. Despite his own powers, Sam is captured and Taraka leaves him. Sam is told that he is to be taken to Heaven and made an example of, lest the other gods try to emulate his rebellion.
# In the place called Heaven, Yama and Kali are to be married. Tak of the Bright Spear is the Archivist of Heaven, but is suspect because he was fathered in lifetimes past by Sam. However, Tak&#x27;s main concern is seducing comely demi-goddesses such as Maya. Sam is more or less free to wander Heaven, even trysting with Kali, who would like to have him back as her lover. He preaches to any who will listen, and the gods allow this, hoping to flush out sympathizers. However, Sam knows of some of his old gadgetry locked away in one of the museums in Heaven, and with the help of Helba, the Goddess of Thieves, he attempts an escape using a belt that amplifies his powers. This fails, and Kali, disgusted with herself and with him, persuades Brahma to order a human sacrifice, namely Helba and Sam himself, to celebrate her wedding. Sam is set free once more to flee for his life, hunted by the White Tigers of Kaniburrha, some of whom may be reincarnated gods, perhaps even Kali herself. Tak attempts to protect Sam by killing the tigers, but is struck down by Ganesha. For this, Tak is sent out of Heaven in the body of an ape. The wedding proceeds, with Sam apparently dead.
# Brahma is dead. He has been murdered by persons or gods unknown. Vishnu, Shiva, and Ganesha gather to quickly arrange a replacement. They decide that the only viable candidate is Kali. However, for her to be reincarnated as Brahma (a man), her short marriage to Yama must end. Yama is appalled at how coldly she accepts this. Next, Shiva is found murdered. Yama throws himself into investigating the deaths. His friend, Kubera, approaches the demigod Murugan and accuses him of the murders, finally addressing him as Sam. Taraka, Lord of the Rakasha, had taken a liking to Sam and &#x27;strengthened his flames&#x27; so he could exist as pure energy, and can survive without a body. He displaced Murugan&#x27;s spirit as Murugan was about to occupy a new body for the wedding feast. Kubera uncovered the deception by examining the brainwave records from the transfer. Instead of turning Sam in, Kubera offers to help him escape. Sam refuses, determined to kill as many gods as he can. Since Kubera&#x27;s friend, Yama, is the obvious next target, Kubera tricks Sam, who underestimates Kubera&#x27;s physical strength and the powers of his Attribute, and in a bout of Irish Stand-Down (in which two men take turns hitting each other until one cannot continue), knocks him out and prepares to flee on the giant bird Garuda. They recruit Ratri to stop Yama from interfering, and take her along. They flee to the city of Keenset, which is undergoing a technological revival and is marked for destruction by the gods. Eventually, Yama, feeling betrayed by Kali and the other gods, joins them. With Yama&#x27;s weaponry, and various allies, including the zombie army of Nirriti the Black, they fight a titanic battle of gods, men, and monsters, killing thousands of men, demigods, and eventually some gods as well. They go down in defeat, but not before dealing a crushing blow to the hierarchy of heaven. Yama apparently commits suicide, but some suspect that he has invented a remote reincarnation device. Ratri is exiled from heaven and condemned to wander the world in a series of homely bodies. Kubera had hidden himself in a vault, held in suspended animation. Sam, having proved himself unkillable, is instead projected into the magnetized debris ring around the planet, known as the Bridge of the Gods. However, the gods win only a Pyrrhic victory. The most powerful deities, such as Yama, Brahma, Shiva, and Agni, are now dead or sworn enemies of Heaven. Others have gone into exile rather than fight against Sam. While Brahma/Kali is exultant, Ganesha realizes that the days of Heaven are numbered, and he must look out for himself.
# In the final story, Sam has been returned from Nirvana. Sam, together with Yama, Ratri, and Kubera, plan their next move in their campaign against heaven. They are joined by the drunken god Krishna, who is a great fighter when sober, and who has wandered the world since he went into exile rather than fight at Keenset. Meanwhile, Nirriti, a Christian and the former chaplain of the original ship, has amassed great power in the southern continent. He is laying waste to cities in his attempts to stamp out the Hindu religion which he hates. He has acquired enough technology to challenge anything the gods can muster, even if they resort to &quot;the tall man of smoke who wears a wide hat&quot;, apparently a reference to a nuclear device. He is also allied with the freed demons. At first he seems to be a natural ally for Sam and Yama, but they entrust the demon Taraka with conveying a message to him, and Taraka is determined to fight Yama, to prove that Taraka is the mightiest being on the planet. Thus Taraka falsely tells them that Nirriti has refused, and instead they ally with Brahma to defeat Nirriti, if Brahma will consent to their demands. This alliance defeats Nirriti in a final battle, despite Ganesha&#x27;s attempt at betrayal, but at a huge cost. Brahma (the former Kali), fatally wounded, is conveyed from the battlefield by Yama. Later, Kubera finds Yama with his &quot;daughter&quot;, whom he calls &quot;Murga&quot;. She is mentally disabled, and Yama admits that this was due to a botched mind-transfer. Kubera, always ready to help his friend, uses his powers to stimulate Murga&#x27;s mind. Sam sees Tak and Ratri restored to young bodies. Sam then leaves, no one is sure where to; sometime later, Yama follows. Myths build up around their life and departure.

== Characters ==
The novel has a range of major and minor characters. The gods live in Heaven, an artificial plateau in the polar regions &quot;where only the mighty might make their home&quot;. It is covered by a giant dome for defense and weather control. Heaven is divided into the Celestial City and the Forest of Kaniburrha.

=== Major characters ===
* Sam is one of the crew of the &quot;Star of India&quot;, the starship which brought the colonists to the planet. Aboard the starship, he had been a botanist and operated the ship&#x27;s hydroponic gardens. He thus belongs to the group who are known as the First, a diminishing group of people. As Sam says, &quot;All the rest are dead, or are gods&quot;. He himself had been a god, styling himself Kalkin. Thanks to his several lives and exploits, he is known by many names, such as &quot;Maitreya, Lord of Light, Manjusri of the Sword, Binder of Demons&quot; and so on. His major contribution to the ascendancy of the Gods was his use of what he termed electrodirection, or mental control of electromagnetics, to control and destroy or bind the most hostile natives of the planet, beings of pure energy known to men as demons. The power can also interfere with electronics and machinery, and, if strengthened, alter gravitation. Eventually disillusioned by the rise of the Gods, he retires to the life of Prince Siddhartha, until he finally rebels. In doing so, he creates more legends, and gains more names, including &quot;Buddha, The Enlightened One, Tathagatha, Mahasamatman or Great-Souled Sam&quot; etc. After an episode of &#x27;demonic possession&#x27; by one of the planet&#x27;s original inhabitants, his &#x27;mind&#x27; can exist outside his body, even if his body is killed. His character is inspired by the Buddhist figure of Siddhartha Gautama.
* Yama, the God of Death, begins as Sam&#x27;s enemy, but later becomes his chief ally. A juvenile scientific genius, he was mortally injured in an accidental explosion, so that he had to be quickly reincarnated into the first available body, which happened to be middle-aged. He therefore was &quot;old before he was young&quot;, and did not have the same outlook as someone who has &quot;known first love in the days of spring&quot;. He is a &quot;master of arms, master of sciences&quot;, who has created much of the new technology behind the power of the Gods&#x27; regime, while himself being a peerless combatant with both medieval and technologically advanced weaponry. He also has the power of the &quot;death gaze&quot;: he can kill by looking his victim in the eyes. Asked by Sam how he can bear to serve a &quot;bunch of drunken body changers&quot; he puts forth a &quot;higher cause&quot; rationale. However he also is emotionally involved with Kali, and eventually revolts as a result of her betrayal. Ganesha assesses him as &quot;too serious, too conscientious&quot;, and &quot;emotionally unstable&quot;. He is loosely based on the Hindu god of the same name.
* Kali, Goddess of Destruction, also known as &quot;Durga&quot;, consort of Kalkin, and once called &quot;Candi the Fierce&quot;, is another of the &quot;First&quot;. Over the centuries, she has been Sam&#x27;s lover, companion, wife, comrade-in-arms, and finally enemy. She yearns for the days when the planet was still wild and unconquered. As Sam warns Yama, who loves her, she loves only &quot;those who bring her gifts of chaos&quot;. Like Yama, she has the death-gaze power, along with many others only hinted at. She also carries a weapon, the skull-wheel, which is some kind of ultrasonic emitter that causes confusion and oblivion, even to the demons. She is very loosely based on the Hindu goddess of the same name.
* Tak, of the Bright Spear, is a former demigod exiled to the world as an ape, as punishment for trying to help Sam while he was in captivity. He is also Sam&#x27;s son, possibly of Sam&#x27;s original body, a fact of which Sam may not be aware. Tak is very philosophical and practical, once rationalizing that when people have many bodies, biological parenthood becomes meaningless; and yet that kinship seems to be his motive for helping Sam.
* Kubera is Yama&#x27;s friend and companion in an order of the Gods called the &quot;Lokapalas&quot;. He loves his food and drink; no matter how he is reincarnated, his body always runs to fat. He is however, shrewdly intelligent and a master technologist, surpassing Yama in some areas. He is known as steadfastedly loyal, and has never broken his word once he has given it. He has the unique ability to invest inanimate objects with emotion and feelings, which he uses to create the &quot;Pavilion of Silence at Worldsend&quot;, a structure at the far end of the place known as Heaven in which rooms are dedicated to emotions such as Despair, Heartbreak, and Fear. This is a place of retreat for the Gods. After centuries of idleness as a God he eventually breaks with the rest and helps Sam. He is very loosely based on the Hindu god of the same name.
* Ratri, the Goddess of the Night, is Kubera&#x27;s friend who is drawn into the conflict, not altogether unwillingly. She too is disgusted by the treatment Sam received in Heaven, and goes to Kubera for advice after she witnesses Brahma&#x27;s last twitches when he is poisoned. Eventually she helps Kubera escape Heaven with Sam. Her power is to cast Night—enforced darkness—across any area, which is used in the Battle of Keenset. After that battle, because she is judged to have been merely weak-willed in helping Sam, she is expelled from Heaven to wander the world in bodies that can not express her powers, or her beauty. In spite of this she can occasionally summon the strength to become the Goddess whose &quot;radiance drives out the dark&quot;. As a character she provides an emotional counterweight to Yama&#x27;s hatred and Sam&#x27;s zeal. She is very loosely based on the Hindu goddess of the same name.

=== Minor characters ===
* Jan Olvegg, also known as &quot;Olvagga&quot;, or &quot;Janaveg&quot;, or &quot;Janagga&quot;, is another one of the &quot;First&quot;, having been the Captain of the colonists&#x27; ship. Sam encounters him in exile while still contemplating his own rebellion. He identifies himself to Olvegg with &quot;It&#x27;s a long way to Tipperary&quot;. Olvegg, who at first cannot recognize Sam because of his changing of bodies, brings Sam up to date on the rise of the Gods since Sam retired, and thus precipitates Sam&#x27;s campaign. He is later captured by, and agrees to fight for, Nirriti the Black. Nirriti remembers that Olvegg was a Christian, although far less fanatical than Nirriti in spreading his faith.
* Rild, later called &quot;Sugata&quot;, is introduced as an assassin and master swordsman, a holy disciple of Kali. He is sent to kill Sam while Sam is reviving Buddhism by playing the Buddha, but instead becomes a convert to Buddhist philosophy and eventually attains true enlightenment. This has some similarities to the tale of Aṅgulimāla. Sugata is also one of the traditional epithets for Buddha. The use of Sugata for Rild stresses his attainment of true enlightenment. Sam, whose epithet is Tathagata, a different traditional epithet for Buddha, refers to Rild as the true Buddha when conversing with Yama. 
* Trimurti, composed of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, rule in Heaven. 
** Brahma, the Creator, is weak-spirited, mostly concerned with his manliness, since he was originally a woman named Madeleine. He is very loosely based on the Hindu god of the same name.
** Shiva, the Destroyer, is an &quot;old warhorse&quot; whose main power is a trident made by Yama, which can kill or disintegrate. Shiva also uses the &quot;Thunder Chariot&quot;, a jet-powered aircraft. He is very loosely based on the Hindu god of the same name.
** Vishnu, the Preserver, was the architect of the place called Heaven, but is a passive god who goes along with Brahma&#x27;s machinations, which in turn seem to be driven by the influence of Kali and Ganesha. He is very loosely based on the Hindu god of the same name.
* Ganesha is a manipulator, an insider, the self-styled power behind the throne. He pushes the other Gods to consolidate their power, even to the extent of persuading them to allow Sam to preach while held captive in Heaven, hoping to tempt sympathizers into revealing themselves. As the power of the Gods wanes, he tries to maintain his position by betraying them to Nirriti. Asked if he trusts Ganesha, Nirriti replies &quot;Yes, but I would give him his silver afterward&quot;, a clear reference to Judas Iscariot, Nirriti being a Christian. He dies in the final battle. He is very loosely based on the Hindu god of the same name.
* Agni, the god of fire, is a fearsome character armed with a wand that emits the &quot;Universal Fire&quot;, a stream of plasma which destroys anything it touches. He and Yama were friends prior to Yama joining Sam. The wand itself can only be held by wearing a special outfit and glove, presumably to protect the holder. He also has goggles that enable him to see in infra-red and ultra-violet wavelengths, and for immense distances. It is said he scarred the faces of the moons with his wand, while standing on the ground. The original Agni replaces Shiva after the latter was killed by Sam, and was replaced himself by subsequent &#x27;lesser&#x27; Agnis who died one after another. The character is loosely based on the Vedic Hindu god bearing the same name.
* Taraka, Lord of the Rakasha, is a demon, an energy being. Like the rest of his kind he was bound by Sam in the early days, but is set free by Sam as part of a bargain to marshal the demons to oppose the gods. Taraka deceives Sam and possesses his body after his release, resulting in Sam and Taraka simultaneously living in Sam&#x27;s body. The cohabitation leads them to each gain some of the traits of the other, but the effect is more pronounced upon Taraka, as he learns to feel sorrow, remorse, and guilt. Eventually, out of respect and as a sort of recompense, Taraka &#x27;strengthens the flames&#x27; of Sam&#x27;s soul, enabling him to live as an energy being like the Rakasha do, if he should be killed. Taraka is killed by Yama&#x27;s death gaze in the final battle, despite Sam&#x27;s warnings. He is loosely based on the Hindu &quot;asura&quot; Tārakāsura.
* Nirriti the Black was originally Renfrew, the chaplain of the colonists&#x27; ship. A staunch Christian, he is disgusted by the ascendancy of Hinduism on the planet and eventually sets himself up with an army of zombie soldiers to conquer and convert the planet. Nirriti is portrayed as a solo megalomaniac, opposed to the pantheon of the Gods. This character is deeply ironic, a Christian who comes to be known as &quot;The Dark Lord&quot;, leader of an army of &quot;Soulless Ones&quot; who have no will of their own but kneel to accompany him in his prayers when so ordered. His final irony is to die in the arms of the false Buddha, Sam. As he dies, he asks for Sam&#x27;s blessing, which is freely given. He is very loosely based on the later Hindu deity Nirṛti.
* Mara, Lord of Illusion, can project complex illusions across great distances, a power that the Gods use both for entertainment and in battle. He is the one God who can stand against Sam and Yama at Keenset where both exert their full powers, being able to misdirect their attacks. Likewise he frustrates Sam&#x27;s attempt to escape Heaven by confusing him as to the way out of the dome. Despite this his character is not much in evidence in the novel, only his actions. In the first story he appears in disguise attempting to find out what Yama is doing, but when confronted, apparently unable to use his powers of illusion effectively against Yama within a limited space, the Death God breaks his neck, thus killing him. He is loosely based on the Buddhist demon bearing the same name.
* Krishna is seen only briefly, and as two different characters. He is characterized as a lord of music and dance, and he wields a power of divine drunkenness. He has enormous charisma. Krishna is mostly an apolitical libertine, but was said to be a deadly wrestler who &quot;broke the black demon Bana&quot; during the battles between the colonists and the native inhabitants of the planet, which suggests that he was one of the First. Eventually, disgusted by the abusive practices of the Gods, he joins Sam&#x27;s efforts to overthrow them. A &#x27;false Krishna&#x27; also is mentioned, as when the original Krishna went missing a replacement was found. The original Krishna was loosely based on the Hindu god of the same name. The &quot;false Krishna&quot; mentioned may have been very loosely inspired by the tale of Paundraka Vasudeva, a mortal King in the Bhagavata Purana who believed himself to be Krishna.
* Murugan, who when introduced is a god of youth in an older body and is patiently awaiting a new body during the wedding of Yama and Kali. He meets the real death when his new body is stolen by Sam during the reincarnation process. He is very loosely based on the Hindu god Kartikeya.

== Film version ==

In 1979 it was announced that &quot;Lord of Light&quot; would be made into a 50 million dollar film. It was planned that the sets for the movie would be made permanent and become the core of a science fiction theme park to be built in Aurora, Colorado. Comic book artist Jack Kirby was contracted to produce artwork for set design. Due to legal problems the project was never completed.
Parts of the unmade film project—the script and Kirby&#x27;s set designs—were subsequently acquired by the CIA as cover for the &quot;Canadian Caper&quot;: the exfiltration of six US diplomatic staff trapped by the Iranian hostage crisis (in Tehran but outside the embassy compound). The rescue team pretended to be scouting a location in Iran for shooting a Hollywood film from the script, which they had renamed &quot;Argo&quot;. The story of the rescue effort was later adapted into the 2012 film &quot;Argo&quot;.

== TV version ==
In 2017, it was announced by Universal Cable Productions that &quot;Lord of Light&quot; would be made into a television series.

<text>Rev James Grahame (22 April 1765 – 14 September 1811) was a Scottish poet. His best-known poem, &quot;The Sabbath&quot;, combines devotional feeling with vivid description of Scottish scenery.

==Early life==
He was born at Whitehill House in Glasgow, the son of Thomas Grahame, a successful lawyer. His elder brother was Robert Grahame of Whitehill. He attended University of Glasgow.

==Career==
After completing his literary course at the University of Glasgow, Grahame went in 1784 to Edinburgh, where he worked as a legal clerk, and was called to the Scottish bar in 1795. However, he had always wanted to go in for the Church, and when he was 44 he took Anglican orders, and became a curate first at Shipton, Gloucestershire, and then at Sedgefield, Durham.

His works include a dramatic poem, &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot; (1801), &quot;The Sabbath&quot; (1804), &quot;The Birds of Scotland&quot; (1806), &quot;British Georgics&quot; (1809), and &quot;Poems on the Abolition of the Slave Trade&quot; in a joint volume on the subject with Elizabeth Benger and James Montgomery (1809). His principal work, &quot;The Sabbath&quot;, a sacred and descriptive poem in blank verse, is characterized by devotional feeling and by happy delineation of Scottish scenery. In the notes to his poems he expresses enlightened views on popular education, the criminal law and other public questions. He was emphatically a friend of humanity—a philanthropist as well as a poet.

A satirical reference to &quot;Sepulchral Grahame&quot; is found in Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot;.

==Personal life==
James Grahame was married to Janet Grahame, eldest daughter of Richard Grahame, Esq. They had two sons and a daughter.

James Grahame died at Whitehill House, his brother Robert&#x27;s home in Glasgow, on 14 September 1811.

===Memorials===
A memorial to Grahame lies on the inner north wall of Glasgow Cathedral.

<text>William Allingham (19 March 1824 – 18 November 1889) was an Irish poet, diarist and editor. He wrote several volumes of lyric verse, and his poem &quot;The Faeries&quot; was much anthologised. But he is better known for his posthumously published &quot;Diary&quot;, in which he records his lively encounters with Tennyson, Carlyle and other writers and artists. His wife, Helen Allingham, was a well-known watercolourist and illustrator.

==Biography==
William Allingham was born on 19 March 1824 in Ballyshannon, a small town in the south of County Donegal in Ulster in the north of Ireland, which is now in the Republic of Ireland. He was the son of William Allingham, the manager of a local bank who was of English descent. His younger brothers and sisters were Catherine (born 1826), John (born 1827), Jane (born 1829), Edward (born 1831, and lived only a few months) and a still-born brother (born 1833). During his childhood, his parents moved twice within the town, where the boy enjoyed the country sights and gardens, learned to paint and listened to his mother&#x27;s piano-playing. When he was nine, his mother died.
He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution until the age of 14, when he obtained a post in the custom-house of his native town, and held several similar posts in Ireland and England until 1870. During this period were published his &quot;Poems&quot; (1850; which included his well-known poem, &quot;The Fairies&quot;) and &quot;Day and Night Songs&quot; (1855; illustrated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others). Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Allingham&quot; (1854–1870), edited by Birkbeck Hill, were published in 1897. &quot;Laurence Bloomfield in Ireland&quot;, his most ambitious, though not his most successful work, a narrative poem illustrative of Irish social questions, appeared in 1864. He also edited &quot;The Ballad Book&quot; for the &quot;Golden Treasury&quot; series in 1864, and &quot;Fifty Modern Poems&quot; in 1865.

In April 1870 Allingham retired from the customs service, moved to London and became sub-editor of &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, eventually becoming editor in succession to James Froude in June 1874, a post he would hold till 1879. On 22 August 1874 he married the illustrator, Helen Paterson, who was twenty-four years younger than he. His wife gave up her work as an illustrator and would become well known under her married name as a water-colour painter. At first the couple lived in London, at 12 Trafalgar Square, Chelsea, near Allingham&#x27;s friend, Thomas Carlyle, and it was there that they had their first two children: Gerald Carlyle (born November 1875) and Eva Margaret (born February 1877). In 1877 appeared Allingham&#x27;s &quot;Songs, Poems and Ballads&quot;. In 1881, after the death of Carlyle, the Allinghams moved to Sandhills near Witley in Surrey, where their third child, Henry William, was born in 1882. At this period Allingham published &quot;Evil May Day&quot; (1883), &quot;Blackberries&quot; (1884) and &quot;Irish Songs and Poems&quot; (1887).

John George Adair was known for the evictions of forty-seven families in Derryveagh, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1861. Overnight, 244 men, women and children were evicted from their homes and left to wander the roads seeking shelter. This terrible event earned him the title &quot;Black Jack Adair&quot;. It triggered William Allingham to write the poem &quot;The Eviction&quot;.

In 1888, because of Allingham&#x27;s declining health, they moved back to the capital, to the heights of Hampstead village. But on 18 November 1889, he died at Hampstead. According to his wishes, he was cremated. His ashes are interred at St. Anne&#x27;s church in his native Ballyshannon.

Posthumously, Allingham&#x27;s &quot;Varieties in Prose&quot; were published in 1893. &quot;William Allingham. A Diary&quot;, edited by Helen Allingham and Dollie Radford, was published in 1907. It contains Allingham&#x27;s reminiscences of Alfred Tennyson, Thomas Carlyle and other writers and artists.

==Assessment and influence==
Working on an un-ostentatious scale, Allingham produced much lyrical and descriptive poetry, and the best of his pieces are thoroughly national in spirit and local colouring. His verse is clear, fresh, and graceful. His best-known poem remains his early work, &quot;The Faeries&quot;.

Allingham had a substantial influence on W. B. Yeats; while the Ulster poet John Hewitt felt Allingham&#x27;s impact keenly, and attempted to revive his reputation by editing, and writing an introduction to, &quot;The Poems of William Allingham &quot;(Oxford University Press &amp; Dolmen Press, 1967). Allingham&#x27;s wide-ranging anthology of poetry, &quot;Nightingale Valley&quot; (1862) was the inspiration for the 1923 collection &quot;Come Hither&quot; by Walter de la Mare.

==Later influences==
The Allingham Arms Hotel in Bundoran, County Donegal is named after him.

&quot;We daren&#x27;t go a-hunting / For fear of little men […]&quot; was quoted by the character of The Tinker near the beginning of the movie &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, as well as in Mike Mignola&#x27;s comic book short story &quot;&quot;, plus the 1973 horror film &quot;Don&#x27;t Look in the Basement&quot;. The lines &quot;Up the airy mountain / Down the rushy glen […]&quot; form part of the character Magrat&#x27;s internal monologue in the Discworld novel &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;. Several lines of the poem are quoted by Henry Flyte, a character in issue No. 65 of the &quot;Supergirl&quot; comic book, August 2011. This same poem was quoted in Andre Norton&#x27;s 1990 science fiction novel &quot;Dare to Go A-Hunting&quot; ().

&quot;Up the Airy Mountain&quot; is the title of a short story by Debra Doyle and James D. Macdonald; while the working title of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; was &quot;For Fear of Little Men&quot;.

<doc id="231301" wikidata="Q1385603" url="?curid=231301" title="Progressing cavity pump">
<text>A progressing cavity pump is a type of positive displacement pump and is also known as a progressive cavity pump, progg cavity pump, eccentric screw pump or cavity pump. It transfers fluid by means of the progress, through the pump, of a sequence of small, fixed shape, discrete cavities, as its rotor is turned. This leads to the volumetric flow rate being proportional to the rotation rate (bidirectionally) and to low levels of shearing being applied to the pumped fluid. 

These pumps have application in fluid metering and pumping of viscous or shear-sensitive materials. The cavities taper down toward their ends and overlap. As one cavity diminishes another increases, the net flow amount has minimal variation as the total displacement is equal. This design results in a flow with little to no pulse.

It is common for equipment to be referred to by the specific manufacturer or product names. Hence names can vary from industry to industry and even regionally; examples include: &quot;Moineau&quot; (after the inventor, René Moineau).
The original 4 Manufacturing licenses were issued to; &quot;MOYNO&quot; pump [Americas], &quot;Mono&quot; pump [UK, Europe], Gardier [Belgium] and PCM. 

A progressing cavity rotor and stator can also act as a motor (mud motor) when fluid is pumped through its interior. Applications include directional well drilling.

==Theory==

The progressing cavity pump normally consists of a helical rotor and a twin helix, twice the wavelength helical hole in a stator. The rotor seals tightly against the stator as it rotates, forming a set of fixed-size cavities in between.
The cavities move when the rotor is rotated but their shape or volume does not change. The pumped material is moved inside the cavities.

The principle of this pumping technique is frequently misunderstood. Often it is believed to occur due to a dynamic effect caused by drag, or friction against the moving teeth of the screw rotor. In reality it is due to the sealed cavities, like a piston pump, and so has similar operational characteristics, such as being able to pump at extremely low rates, even to high pressure, revealing the effect to be purely positive displacement. The rotor &quot;climbs&quot; the inner cavity in an orbital manner (see pump).

At a high enough pressure the sliding seals between cavities will leak some fluid rather than pumping it, so when pumping against high pressures a longer pump with more cavities is more effective, since each seal has only to deal with the pressure difference between adjacent cavities. Pump design begins with two (to three) cavities per stage. The number of stages (currently up to 24) is only limited by the ability to machine the tooling.

When the rotor is rotated, it rolls/climbs around the inside surface of the hole. The motion of the rotor is the same as the planet gears of a planetary gears system. As the rotor simultaneously rotates and moves around, the combined motion of the eccentrically mounted drive shaft is in the form of a hypocycloid. In the typical case of single-helix rotor and double-helix stator, the hypocycloid is just a straight line. The rotor must be driven through a set of universal joints or other mechanisms to allow for the eccentricity.

The rotor takes a form similar to a corkscrew, and this, combined with the off-center rotary motion, leads to the alternative name: eccentric screw pump.

Different rotor shapes and rotor/stator pitch ratios exist, but are specialized in that they don&#x27;t generally allow complete sealing, so reducing low speed pressure and flow rate linearity, but improving actual flow rates, for a given pump size, and/or the pump&#x27;s solids handling ability.

==Operation==
In operation, progressing cavity pumps are fundamentally fixed flow rate pumps, like piston pumps and peristaltic pumps, and this type of pump needs a fundamentally different understanding than the types of pumps to which people are more commonly introduced, namely ones that can be thought of as generating pressure. This can lead to the mistaken assumption that all pumps can have their flow rates adjusted by using a valve attached to their outlet, but with this type of pump this assumption is a problem, since such a valve will have practically no effect on the flow rate and completely closing it will involve very high pressures being generated. To prevent this, pumps are often fitted with cut-off pressure switches, rupture discs (deliberately weak and easily replaced), or a bypass pipe that allows a variable amount of a fluid to return to the inlet. With a bypass fitted, a fixed flow rate pump is effectively converted to a fixed pressure one.

At the points where the rotor touches the stator, the surfaces are generally traveling transversely, so small areas of sliding contact occur. These areas need to be lubricated by the fluid being pumped (hydrodynamic lubrication). This can mean that more torque is required for starting, and if allowed to operate without fluid, called &#x27;run dry&#x27;, rapid deterioration of the stator can result.

While progressing cavity pumps offer long life and reliable service transporting thick or lumpy fluids, abrasive fluids will significantly shorten the life of the stator. However, slurries (particulates in a medium) can be pumped reliably if the medium is viscous enough to maintain a lubrication layer around the particles and so protect the stator.

==Typical design==
Specific designs involve the rotor of the pump being made of a steel, coated with a smooth hard surface, normally chromium, with the body (the stator) made of a molded elastomer inside a metal tube body. The elastomer core of the stator forms the required complex cavities. The rotor is held against the inside surface of the stator by angled link arms, bearings (immersed in the fluid) allowing it to roll around the inner surface (un-driven). Elastomer is used for the stator to simplify the creation of the complex internal shape, created by means of casting, which also improves the quality and longevity of the seals by progressively swelling due to absorption of water and/or other common constituents of pumped fluids. Elastomer/pumped fluid compatibility will thus need to be taken into account.

Two common designs of stator are the &quot;equal-walled&quot; and the &quot;unequal-walled&quot;. The latter, having greater elastomer wall thickness at the peaks allows larger-sized solids to pass through because of its increased ability to distort under pressure. The former have a constant elastomer wall thickness and therefore exceed in most other aspects such as pressure per stage, precision, heat transfer, wear, and weight. They are more expensive due to the complex shape of the outer tube.

==History==
In 1930, René Moineau, a pioneer of aviation, while inventing a compressor for jet engines, discovered that this principle could also work as a pumping system. The University of Paris awarded René Moineau a doctorate of science for his thesis on “A new capsulism”. His pioneering dissertation laid the groundwork for the progressing cavity pump.

<text>George Birkbeck Norman Hill (7 June 1835 – 24 February 1903) was an English editor and author.

==Life==
He was the son of Arthur Hill, headmaster of Bruce Castle School, and was born at Bruce Castle, Tottenham, Middlesex. He dropped his third name, Norman, publishing as just George Birkbeck Hill; to family and friends he was known as Birkbeck, not as George. His mother died when he was four years old; on her father&#x27;s side, she was related to Frederick Denison Maurice.

Arthur Hill, with his brothers Rowland Hill, the postal reformer and Matthew Davenport Hill, afterwards recorder of Birmingham had worked out a system of education which was to exclude compulsion of any kind. The school at Bruce Castle, of which Arthur Hill was head master, was founded to carry into execution their theories, known as the Hazelwood system, after Hazelwood School, Birmingham, that preceded it. George Birkbeck Hill was educated in his father&#x27;s school and at Pembroke College, Oxford, where he made lasting friendships with Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. It was also at Oxford that he began his writing career, contributing articles to William Fulford&#x27;s &quot;Oxford and Cambridge Magazine&quot;. Hill suffered a serious attack of typhoid fever in 1856 which left him in a delicate state of health. Consequently, he only received an &#x27;honorary&#x27; fourth class degree in 1858, although he was later awarded a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1866 and a Doctor of Civil Law in 1871 in recognition of his contribution to English letters.

In 1858, Hill began to teach at Bruce Castle School, and from 1868 to 1877 was headmaster, succeeding his father. He married Annie Scott, daughter of Edward Scott and the sister of a friend from his school-days, on 29 December 1858. Partly to relieve what he felt to be the tedium of running the school, Hill returned to writing and reviewing. In 1869, he became a regular contributor to the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, with which he remained in connection until 1884. 

On his retirement from teaching he devoted himself to the study of 18th-century English literature, and established his reputation as the most learned commentator on the works of Samuel Johnson. His six-volume edition for the Clarendon Press of &quot;Boswell&#x27;s Life of Johnson&quot; (1887) has remained the standard edition for scholarly use into the twenty-first century.

Remaining true to his family&#x27;s radical roots, Hill was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party and actively campaigned on behalf of Gladstone in the mid-1880s. He settled at Oxford in 1887, and in 1889 made a trip retracing the footsteps of Johnson and Boswell&#x27;s Scottish trip, but from 1891 onwards his winters were usually spent abroad for his health.

George Birkbeck Hill was editor of the published letters (1874–1879) of Charles George Gordon; this editorial role arose from a family connection. Birkbeck Hill&#x27;s wife Annie was the sister of Sir John Scott (1841–1904), who was judicial advisor to the Khedive from 1891 to 1898 and a close personal friend of Charles George Gordon. Birkbeck Hill&#x27;s sister Laura was the second wife of Sir John Scott&#x27;s father.

His wife Annie died in Aspley Guise on 30 October 1902, and he died shortly thereafter, at Hampstead, London, on 27 February 1903. 
Hill and his wife are buried at Aspley Guise, and he bequeathed his Johnsonian library to Pembroke College, Oxford. 
They had five sons and two daughters; all seven children were born at Tottenham. 
One son died in 1882. Three of their five sons were knighted: Sir Maurice Hill, a judge on the High Court, Sir Norman Hill, a well-known legal authority on shipping, and Sir Leonard Erskine Hill, a physiologist made F.R.S. Their elder Margaret daughter married Sir William James Ashley.

<text>The stator is the stationary part of a rotary system, found in electric generators, electric motors, sirens, mud motors, or biological rotors (such as bacterial flagella or ATP synthase). Energy flows through a stator to or from the rotating component of the system, the rotor. In an electric motor, the stator provides a magnetic field that drives the rotating armature; in a generator, the stator converts the rotating magnetic field to electric current. In fluid powered devices, the stator guides the flow of fluid to or from the rotating part of the system.

==Design==
Motor stators are made either from iron/steel or from a printed circuit board (PCB). Originally applied to low-power applications, PCB stators can be lighter, smaller, and less noisy.

One design embeds thin copper traces in the PCB stator that serve as the windings. The traces are interleaved with epoxy-glass laminates, that insulate each coil from its neighbors. An air core replaces the traditional iron core, saving space and weight, and allowing a smaller air gap.

Hairpin windings may be used in the construction of electric motor stators. This technology, uses windings with wires that individually, may have larger cross sections than those used in conventional windings.

==Motors==
Depending on the configuration of a spinning electromotive device the stator may act as the &quot;field magnet&quot;, interacting with the armature to create motion, or it may act as the &quot;armature&quot;, receiving its influence from moving field coils on the rotor. The first DC generators (known as dynamos) and DC motors put the field coils on the stator, and the power generation or motive reaction coils on the rotor. This is necessary because a continuously moving power switch known as the commutator is needed to keep the field correctly aligned across the spinning rotor. The commutator must become larger and more robust as the current increases.
The stator of these devices may be either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet.

An AC alternator produces power across multiple high-current power generation coils connected in parallel, eliminating the commutator.

==Fluid devices==
In a turbine, the stator element contains blades or ports used to redirect the flow of fluid. Such devices include the steam turbine and the torque converter. In a mechanical siren, the stator contains one or more rows of holes that admit air into the rotor; by controlling the flow of air through the holes, the sound of the siren can be altered. A stator can reduce the turbulence and rotational energy introduced by an axial turbine fan, creating a steady column of air with a lower Reynolds number.

<text>Matthew Davenport Hill (6 August 1792 – 7 June 1872) was an English lawyer and prison reform campaigner and MP.

==Life==
Hill was born at Birmingham, where his father, Thomas Wright Hill, for long conducted the private schools Hazelwood and Bruce Castle. He was a brother of the postal reformer Sir Rowland Hill and the prison inspector Frederic Hill. He acted as assistant in his father&#x27;s school, but in 1819 was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. In 1832 he was elected one of the Liberal Members of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull, but he lost his seat at the next election in 1834. On the incorporation of Birmingham in 1839 he was appointed as the town&#x27;s recorder (judge); and in 1851 he was appointed commissioner in bankruptcy for the Bristol district. Taking an interest in questions relating to the treatment of criminal offenders, he publicly aired opinions which were the means of introducing many important reforms in the methods of dealing with crime, drawing notably upon the theories of the Scottish penal reformer, Alexander Maconochie. His book &quot;Mettray&quot; (1855) describes the Mettray Penal Colony with its then new approach to dealing with young delinquents.

One of his principal coadjutors in these reforms was his brother Frederic Hill (1803–1896), whose &quot;Amount, Causes and Remedies of Crime&quot;, the result of his experience as inspector of prisons for Scotland. marked an era in the methods of prison discipline. Hill was one of the chief promoters of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and the originator of the &quot;Penny Magazine&quot;. He died at Stapleton, near Bristol.

In 1868 the West of England Suffrage Society, part of the National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, was formed at his house. His daughter Florence was one of the first members, and later members included Agnes Beddoe, Emily and Elizabeth Sturge.

Two of his daughters wrote an early biography in 1878.

==Family==
Hill married Margaret Bucknall on 3 November 1819. Their children were Alfred Hill (born 1821), Rosamond Davenport Hill (born in Chelsea in 1825), Florence Davenport Hill (also born in Chelsea in 1828), Matthew Berkeley Hill, and Joanna Margaret Hill (born in Hampstead in 1836/37).

==Works==
His principal works are:
*&quot;Practical Suggestions to the Founders of Reformatory Schools&quot; (1855)
*&quot;Suggestions for the Repression of Crime&quot; (1857), consisting of charges addressed to the grand juries of Birmingham
*&quot;Mettray&quot; (1855)
*&quot;Papers on the Penal Servitude Acts&quot; (1864)
*&quot;Journal of a Third Visit to the Convict Gaols, Refuges and Reformatories of Dublin&quot; (1865)
*&quot;Addresses delivered at the Birmingham and Midland Institute&quot; (1867).

<text>Charles Isaac Elton, QC (6 December 1839 – 23 April 1900) was an English lawyer, antiquary, and politician. He is most famous for being one of the authors of the bestselling book &quot;The Great Book-Collectors&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was born in Southampton. Educated at Cheltenham and Balliol College, Oxford, he was elected a fellow of Queen&#x27;s College in 1862. On 6 August 1863 he married Mary Augusta Strachey, a granddaughter of Sir Henry Strachey, 1st Baronet, in Clifton, England. He was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1865. His remarkable knowledge of old real property law and custom helped him to an extensive conveyancing practice and he took silk in 1885. He sat in the House of Commons for West Somerset in 1884–1885 and for Wellington, Somerset, from 1886 to 1892. In 1869 he succeeded to his uncle&#x27;s property of Whitestaunton Manor, near Chard, Somerset.

During the later years of his life he retired to a great extent from legal practice, and devoted much of his time to literary work. He died at Whitestaunton.

== Work ==
Elton&#x27;s principal works were
* &quot;The Great Book-Collectors&quot; (1864);
* &quot;The Tenures of Kent&quot; (1867);
* &quot;Treatise on Commons and Waste Lands&quot; (1868);
* &quot;Law of Copyholds&quot; (1874);
* &quot;Origins of English History&quot; (1882);
* &quot;Custom and Tenant Right&quot; (1882).
* &quot;William Shakespeare: His Family and Friends&quot; (1903), ed. from posthumous papers by A. Hamilton Thompson

Virginia Woolf often quotes his poem &quot;Luriana Lurilee&quot; in her novel &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; (1927), although the poem itself was not published until 1945.

<doc id="231308" wikidata="Q44286" url="?curid=231308" title="Rudolf Mössbauer">
<text>Rudolf Ludwig Mössbauer (German spelling: &quot;Mößbauer&quot;; ; 31 January 1929 – 14 September 2011) was a German physicist best known for his 1957 discovery of &#x27;recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence&#x27;, for which he was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics. This effect, called the Mössbauer effect, is the basis for Mössbauer spectroscopy.

== Career ==
Mössbauer was born in Munich, where he also studied physics at the Technical University of Munich. He prepared his Diplom thesis in the Laboratory of Applied Physics of Heinz Maier-Leibnitz and graduated in 1955. He then went to the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg. Since this institute, not part of a university, had no right to award a doctorate, Mössbauer remained under the auspices of Maier-Leibnitz, his official thesis advisor, when he passed his PhD exam in Munich in 1958.

In his PhD, he discovered the &quot;recoilless nuclear fluorescence of gamma rays in 191 iridium,&quot; the Mössbauer effect. His fame grew immensely in 1960 when Robert Pound and Glen Rebka used this effect to prove the red shift of gamma radiation in the gravitational field of the Earth; this Pound–Rebka experiment was one of the first experimental precision tests of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. However, the long-term importance of the Mössbauer effect is its use in Mössbauer spectroscopy. Along with Robert Hofstadter, Rudolf Mössbauer was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics.

On the suggestion of Richard Feynman, Mössbauer was invited in 1960 to Caltech in the USA, where he advanced rapidly from research fellow to senior research fellow; he was appointed a full professor of physics in early 1962. In 1964, his alma mater, the Technical University of Munich (TUM), convinced him to go back as a full professor. He retained this position until he became professor emeritus in 1997. As a condition for his return, the faculty of physics introduced a &quot;department&quot; system. This system, strongly influenced by Mössbauer&#x27;s American experience, was in radical contrast to the traditional, hierarchical &quot;faculty&quot; system of German universities, and it gave the TUM an eminent position in German physics.

In 1972, Rudolf Mössbauer went to Grenoble to succeed Heinz Maier-Leibnitz as the director of the Institut Laue-Langevin just when its newly built high-flux research reactor went into operation. After serving a five-year term, Mössbauer returned to Munich, where he found his institutional reforms reversed by overarching legislation. Until the end of his career, he often expressed bitterness over this &quot;destruction of the department.&quot; Meanwhile, his research interests shifted to neutrino physics.

Mössbauer was regarded as an excellent teacher. He gave highly specialized lectures on numerous courses, including &quot;Neutrino Physics,&quot; &quot;Neutrino Oscillations,&quot; &quot;The Unification of the Electromagnetic and Weak Interactions&quot; and &quot;The Interaction of Photons and Neutrons With Matter.&quot; In 1984, he gave undergraduate lectures to 350 people taking the physics course. He told his students: “Explain it! The most important thing is that you can explain it! You will have exams, there you have to explain it. Eventually, you pass them, you get your diploma and you think, that&#x27;s it! – No, the whole life is an exam, you&#x27;ll have to write applications, you&#x27;ll have to discuss with peers... So learn to explain it! You can train this by explaining to another student, a colleague. If they are not available, explain it to your mother – or to your cat!”

== Personal life ==
Mössbauer married Elizabeth Pritz in 1957. They had a son, Peter and two daughters Regine and Susi. They divorced in 1983, and he married his second wife Christel Braun in 1985.

Mössbauer died at Grünwald, Germany on 14 September 2011 at 82.

<text>Apoptygma Berzerk (; commonly abbreviated to APB or APOP) is a Norwegian band that produces a style of synth-pop and ballads backed with electronic rhythms, commonly known within the scene as &quot;futurepop&quot;. Apoptygma Berzerk has won awards and top 10 spots in Germany and Scandinavia. Apoptygma Berzerk has toured Europe, North America, South America, Israel and Australia with bands such as VNV Nation, Beborn Beton, Icon of Coil and Unheilig.

== Formation ==
The band was formed by Stephan Groth and Jon Erik Martinsen in 1989. Martinsen left the band due to creative differences. The name &quot;Apoptygma Berzerk&quot; has no particular meaning; frontman and founding member Groth claims that it was randomly picked out of a dictionary (the first word being derived from the Ancient Greek word meaning &quot;piece of a tunic&quot;).

== Influences and style ==
Groth has cited influences including Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Jean-Michel Jarre and John Carpenter. The first two albums, &quot;Soli Deo Gloria&quot; and &quot;7&quot;, were a similar style of electropop and EBM. &quot;Welcome to Earth&quot; eschewed the dark themes of &quot;7&quot; for a lighter, less aggressive sound, and included a few experimental tracks. In &quot;Harmonizer&quot; the style changed a softer, more synthpop-oriented direction, compared to previous albums, and their 2006 album, &quot;You and Me Against the World&quot;, represented an almost complete change in style for the band. It featured a more mainstream, indie rock-oriented sound, and the complete departure from the band&#x27;s traditional electric synthpop and EBM roots that started with &quot;7&quot;. In 2009, they released their album &quot;Rocket Science&quot;.

Many albums feature a hidden track that can be accessed by fast forwarding through many minutes of silence on the last album track. For instance, on &quot;7&quot;, one can hear a remix of &quot;Nonstop Violence&quot; after &quot;Love Never Dies (Part II)&quot;.

== Cover songs ==
The band has recorded cover songs for several of their albums. On the American version of &quot;7&quot; a cover of &quot;Electricity&quot; by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark is featured; similarly, &quot;Welcome to Earth&quot; features a cover of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. &quot;You and Me Against the World&quot; has a cover of &quot;Cambodia&quot; by Kim Wilde and &quot;Shine On&quot; by The House Of Love. They have also recorded covers of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;, Suede&#x27;s &quot;Trash&quot;, Keane&#x27;s &quot;Bend and Break&quot;, Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Ohm Sweet Ohm&quot; and Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;Coma White&quot;. Most recently, they have covered Peter Schilling&#x27;s &quot;Major Tom (Coming Home)&quot;.

<text>Edward Augustus Freeman (2 August 182316 March 1892) was an English historian, architectural artist, and Liberal politician, a one-time candidate for Parliament. He held the position of Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, where he tutored Arthur Evans; later he and Evans were activists in the Balkan uprising of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1874–1878) against the Ottoman Empire. 

After the marriage of his daughter Margaret to Evans, he and Evans collaborated on the fourth volume of his &quot;History of Sicily&quot;. He was a prolific writer, publishing 239 distinct works. One of his best known is his magnum opus, &quot;The History of the Norman Conquest of England&quot; (published in 6 volumes, 1867–1879).

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Freeman was born at Metchley Abbey in Harborne, Warwickshire (now a suburb of Birmingham). His parents, John and Mary Ann ( Carless) Freeman, used the Latin name of the month in which he was born as his middle name. They were a family of modest means; however, the paternal grandfather, Joseph Freeman (about 1768–1822), had been a wealthy man, and the owner of Pedmore Hall. On his death, his will was disputed, and lawyers&#x27; fees consumed the bulk of the estate. Edward&#x27;s father, the oldest son, and his two paternal uncles, Keelinge and Joseph, received little to sustain them.

Edward&#x27;s mother, Mary Anne, née Carless (or Carlos), had noble ancestry, descending through her father, William, then residing near Birmingham, from the same Colonel William Carless who had assisted the future Charles II as he hid from his enemies in the branches of the Royal Oak after the Battle of Worcester, 1651, the last of the English Civil War. Mary Anne&#x27;s family still displayed the coat of arms given to them.

The family was never in good health. They delayed baptising Edward for a year, hoping to avoid public exposure to contagious diseases. The family was struck by tragedy in November 1824, when the father died of an unknown disease, the mother died four days later of tuberculosis, and the oldest daughter, Mary Anne, then age 14, died of an unknown disease the same day, 25 November. Edward&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Emmete Freeman, immediately took charge of the three survivors, Edward and his two sisters, Sarah and Emma, aged 13 and 10 respectively, bringing them to her home at Weston-super-Mare. Emma died in 1826 when Edward was three years old.

===Education and marriage===

Freeman was educated at private schools and by a private tutor. Even as a boy, he was interested in religious matters, history and foreign politics. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford, and a second class in the degree examination, and was elected fellow of his college (1845). While at Oxford he was much influenced by the High Church movement, and thought seriously of taking orders, but abandoned the idea. He married Eleanor Gutch (1818–1903) daughter of his former tutor, the Reverend Robert Gutch, on 13 April 1847 at Seagrave, Leicestershire, and entered on a life of study.

He lived in Llanrumney Hall, Cardiff, in the mid 19th century. Freeman later bought a house called &quot;Somerleaze&quot;, near Wells, Somerset, and settled there in 1860.

===Death===

From 1886 Freeman was forced by ill health to spend much of his time abroad. In February 1892 he visited Spain in company with his wife and two younger daughters. He fell ill at Valencia on 7 March, but on the 9th went on to Alicante, where his illness proved to be smallpox. He died at Alicante on 16 March, and was buried in the Protestant cemetery there (now referred to as the &quot;British cemetery&quot; section of the Cementerio de Alicante). He left two sons and four daughters. The Latin inscription on his gravestone was written by his son-in-law, Sir Arthur Evans. 

His eldest son, Harold, married Alice Mary Wakefield. She was the daughter of Daniel Wakefield and the granddaughter of Thomas Attwood.

==Career==
===Historian===

Freeman was made D.C.L. of Oxford and LL.D. of Cambridge &quot;honoris causa&quot;, and when he visited the United States on a lecture tour was well received at various institutions of learning. In 1884 he was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, and was, for a time, a non-resident professor at Cornell University. Whilst at Oxford, he presided over the Stubbs Society, an exclusive group of high-achieving historians. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1885.

He advanced the study of history in England in two directions: by insistence on the unity of history, and by teaching the importance and right use of primary sources. Politics was at the core, for he often said, &quot;History is past politics and politics present history.&quot; He urged that history not be divided &quot;by a middle wall of partition&quot; into ancient and modern, nor broken into fragments as though the history of each nation stood apart. He declared it more than a collection of narratives, deeming it a science, &quot;the science of man in his political character.&quot; Freeman asserted that the historical student should view all history as within his range, and have his own special range within which he masters every detail (&quot;Rede Lecture&quot;).

Freeman&#x27;s range included Greek, Roman and the earlier part of English history, together with some portions of foreign medieval history, and he had a scholarly though general knowledge of the rest of the history of the European world. Freeman regarded Rome as &quot;the central truth of European history,&quot; the bond of its unity, and he undertook his &quot;History of Sicily&quot; (1891–1894) partly to illustrate this unity. He believed that all historical study is valueless unless based on a knowledge of original authorities, and explained how they should be weighed and used. He did not use manuscript authorities, however, and maintained he had no need to do so for most of his work, as the authorities he needed were already in print.
His reputation as a historian rests chiefly on his six-volume &quot;History of the Norman Conquest&quot; (1867–1879), his longest completed work. In common with his works generally, it is distinguished by exhaustiveness of treatment and research, critical ability, and general accuracy. He is almost exclusively a political historian, and his works are infused with personal insights he gained from his practical experience of people and institutions. His saying that &quot;history is past politics and politics are present history&quot; is significant of this limitation of his work, which dealt less with other subjects in a nation&#x27;s life.

J. W. Burrow proposed that Freeman, like William Stubbs and John Richard Green, was a historical scholar with little or no experience of public affairs, with views of the present which were Romantically historicised and who was drawn to history by what was in a broad sense an antiquarian passion for the past, as well as a patriotic and populist impulse to identify the nation and its institutions as the collective subject of English history, making
===Politician===
Freeman involved himself in politics, was a follower of Gladstone, and approved the Home Rule Bill of 1886, but objected to the later proposal to retain the Irish members at Westminster. To enter Parliament was one of his ambitions, and in 1868 he unsuccessfully contested Mid-Somerset. Foreign rather than domestic politics were his main interest. He expressed an antipathy for the Turks and was sympathetic with the smaller and subject nationalities of eastern Europe. He was prominent in the agitation which followed &quot;the Bulgarian atrocities&quot; of the April Uprising; his speeches were often intemperate, and he was accused of uttering the words &quot;Perish India!&quot; at a public meeting in 1876. This, however, was a misrepresentation of his words. He was made a knight commander of the Order of the Saviour by the King of Greece, and also received an order from the Prince of Montenegro.

For some years he was an active county magistrate. He served on the royal commission on ecclesiastical courts, being appointed in 1881.

Freeman was an opponent of the Imperial Federation movement. He was a proponent of Anglo-Saxonism.

===Prejudices===
Freeman&#x27;s attitude towards Jews has been described as one of disdain. His private correspondence had referred to British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli as &quot;the dirty Jew&quot;. Of Jews in America more generally, he wrote:

In a letter to a friend, describing America, Freeman wrote, &quot;This would be a grand land if only every Irishman would kill a negro, and be hanged for it&quot;.

==Works==

===Architecture===
Freeman had a particular interest in ecclesiastical architecture and visited many churches. He soon began a practice of making drawings of buildings on the spot and afterwards tracing them over in ink. His first book, except for his share in a volume of English verse, was a &quot;History of Architecture&quot; (1849). Though he had not then seen any buildings outside England, it contains a good sketch of the development of the art. In 1851 he published &quot;An Essay on the Origin and Development of Window Tracery in England&quot;, which proposed the terms &quot;Flowing&quot; and &quot;Flamboyant&quot; (the latter term already in use in France, though not with exactly the same meaning, continuing right through the English Perpendicular Period) instead of Thomas Rickman&#x27;s &quot;Decorated&quot;, which had been generally adopted since it was first published in 1817. The same year Edmund Sharpe published an alternative proposal, &quot;The Seven Periods of English Architecture&quot;, dividing the fenestration of the Decorated period between a Geometrical Period to 1315 followed by a Curvilinear Period to 1360. Though Rickman&#x27;s scheme remains in use, the subdivisions proposed by both Freeman and Sharpe are also often found in recent books.

===Historical works and journalism===
Freeman&#x27;s life was marked by a prodigious literary output. His published scholarly works include the six large volumes of &quot;Norman Conquest&quot;, his unfinished &quot;History of Sicily&quot;, and his &quot;William Rufus&quot; (1882). He wrote several others on the early Middle Ages, and produced works on Aratus, Sulla, Nicias, William the Conqueror, Thomas of Canterbury, Frederick II and many more. He was also interested in Switzerland and in comparative constitutional history. Freeman wrote articles for various other publications, including reviews for newspapers and other periodicals, and was a prolific contributor to the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; until 1878, when he ceased to write for it for political reasons.

The naturalist William Henry Hudson was dismissive of Freeman&#x27;s style of argument in his 1920 book &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Plack and an Old Thorn&quot;.

===Books and papers===
Freeman&#x27;s personal library of some 6,500 volumes was bought for Owens College, Manchester, by the trustees of Sir Joseph Whitworth, and it remains in the college&#x27;s successor institution, the University of Manchester, though no longer kept together. A catalogue was published by the college in 1894. Most of Freeman&#x27;s papers are also now held in the University of Manchester Library, including works in manuscript, correspondence and 6,200 of his architectural sketches of European churches.

<doc id="231319" wikidata="Q315822" url="?curid=231319" title="Nicias">
<text>Nicias (; ; 470–413 BC) was an Athenian politician and general, who was prominent during the Peloponnesian War. A slaveowning member of the Athenian aristocracy, he inherited a large fortune from his father, and had investments in the silver mines around Laurion, in south-east Attica.

Following the death of Pericles in 429 BC, Nicias became the principal rival of Cleon and the democrats in the struggle for political leadership of the Athenian state. Politically a moderate conservative, he opposed the aggressive imperialism of Cleon and Alcibiades. Despite his political views, Nicias served as &quot;strategos&quot; (general) during the Peloponnesian War, and led a number of expeditions which were mostly successful, although he had a reputation for being over-cautious. Nicias&#x27; goal was to conclude a peace with Sparta on terms favourable to Athens, and he was largely responsible for negotiating the short-lived Peace of Nicias in 421 BC.

In 415 BC, Nicias was appointed commander of Athens&#x27; ill-fated Sicilian Expedition. A series of disasters led to the destruction of the Athenian forces, and Nicias was executed by the Syracusans in 413 BC.

==Early life and political rise==

Nicias was born c.470 BC in Athens. His wealthy, slaveowning family was aristocratic, and strictly adhered to conservative principles politically. He inherited a fortune from his father, Niceratus, and had considerable interests in the silver mines of Laurion. Xenophon wrote of &quot;how once on a time Nicias, the son of Niceratus, owned a thousand men [slaves] in the silver mines, whom he let out to Sosias, a Thracian&quot;.

Nicias&#x27; rise to prominence occurred while Pericles was at the head of the Athenian government, and as a noted member of the aristocratic party, Nicias became a frequent military and political colleague of Pericles. After Pericles&#x27; death in 429 BC, Nicias became an important Athenian politician with the aristocratic (conservative) party looking to him as their leader and, as such, he became the rival of Cleon&#x27;s popular or democratic party. J. B. Bury wrote that Nicias lacked the ability to lead a political party, since he &quot;had not the qualities of a leader or a statesman&quot;. As for how Nicias came to wield influence, Bury referred to his honesty and integrity in that he was impervious to bribes. He was also considered respectable, given his family background, and he was acknowledged to be well acquainted with military details; but perhaps his strongest quality was his devoutly unscrupulous devotion to religion.

Public generosity was the means by which Nicias acquired popularity. He patronised various charitable causes and city services, especially if there was a religious connection. Plutarch commented on him gaining prestige by his sponsorship of both a statue of Athena and a shrine to Dionysus. Plutarch specifically mentioned Nicias&#x27; support for the annual Festival of Delos. He paid for the construction of a bridge of boats between Delos and Rheneia. This bridge, extravagantly decorated with garlands and tapestry, enabled a richly-dressed chorus to walk across to Rheneia. Nicias donated 10,000 drachma, so the Delians could continue to stage the event, and pray on his behalf. His instructions were engraved on a pillar.

==Military career to 424 BC==
Politically and militarily, Nicias was one of Athens&#x27; key figures in the Peloponnesian War. The first mention of him by Thucydides is in the &quot;Fifth Year of the War&quot; (428 BC). In the summer of that year, after Athenian forces had seized control of Lesbos, Nicias was placed in command of an expedition against Minoa, an island off Megara which had a watchtower used by the Megarians to observe Athenian shipping. Nicias desired to reverse this situation so that Athens could spy on Peloponnesian vessels, and more effectively blockade Megara. The expedition was a success and, having built additional fortifications on Minoa, Nicias left a garrison there.

Following this success, Nicias was elected to the post of &quot;strategos&quot; (general of the army) in both 427 and 425 BC. In the summer of 427 BC, he commanded a fleet of sixty ships carrying two thousand heavy artillery to carry out attacks against Melos, Tanagra, and the seaboard of Locris. The operations were a success.

The naval Battle of Pylos, in 425 BC, resulted in a victory for Athens which left some 420 Spartan hoplites stranded on the island of Sphacteria. Desperate to rescue these soldiers, Sparta sued for peace, but the negotiations failed as Sparta could not meet the Athenian terms. Athens then besieged Sphacteria, but without success as the Spartans were entrenched with adequate supplies of food and water. The stalemate caused political crisis in Athens, where many citizens argued that Sparta&#x27;s offer of peace should have been accepted. As the main pro-war spokesman, Cleon insisted the reports from Sphacteria were misleading—he believed the Spartans would soon surrender. Nicias challenged Cleon to join a commission which would visit Pylos and Sphacteria to verify the situation. Cleon responded that Nicias was wasting time and should be attacking the Spartan stronghold, not besieging it.

Nicias countered the criticism by offering to resign as &quot;strategos&quot; so Cleon could lead reinforcements to Sphacteria. Cleon tried to back down but Nicias had swayed the &quot;ecclesia&quot;, and Cleon had no choice but to accept the command. This led to the Battle of Sphacteria, in which Athens was victorious and took 292 Spartan prisoners, who became an important bargaining counter in the next few years of warfare.

Nicias suffered some loss of credibility after Cleon&#x27;s success on Sphacteria, but he quickly recovered by leading a force into Corinthian territory, where he carried out a number of raids before seizing the peninsula of Methone in the Argolis, between Troezen and Epidaurus. The isthmus was fortified and Nicias left a garrison in Methone. In 424 BC, he commanded the force which captured Cythera. This became an important base for operations against Laconia itself. The Athenians now held three key positions in the Peloponnese—Cythera, Methone, and Pylos.

During his years in command, Nicias exercised caution by refusing to take risks, and avoided significant military engagement. According to Plutarch, this was to his benefit, as Nicias was able to avoid the worst of Athens&#x27; misfortunes, both military and political. Plutarch held that &quot;Nicias declined all difficult and lengthy enterprises; if he took a command, he was for doing what was safe&quot;. However, Plutarch noted that, on the battlefield, Nicias was recognised as a fair combatant, fighting as courageously as any other soldier.

==&quot;Champion of peace&quot; (423–415 BC)==
===Truce of Laches===
In 423, after a decade of fighting had left both sides exhausted, their respective anti-war factions sought to initiate peace talks. In Athens, there was increasing concern about the success of Sparta&#x27;s most effective general, Brasidas, who was campaigning in Chalcidice, Thrace, and Macedonia. The Athenian general Laches, supported by Nicias, sought to counter this by calling on the &quot;ecclesia&quot; to seek an armistice. His motion was carried. J. B. Bury argued that this policy was misguided. He supported Cleon&#x27;s counter-argument that Athens should not have pursued peace &quot;until the success of Brasidas had been decisively checked&quot;, and some degree of prestige restored. Bury said the resolve of the Athenians was undermined by Nicias and Laches, whose case rested on &quot;the feelings of the hour&quot;, whereas Cleon called on them &quot;to weigh considerations of policy&quot;.

However, this &quot;Truce of Laches&quot; had little impact on Brasidas and collapsed within a year. The town of Scione, in Chalcidice, revolted against Athens and swore allegiance to Brasidas. Soon afterwards, the neighbouring town of Mende followed suit. Brasidas was then needed to reinforce his ally Perdiccas against hostile Illyrians in Macedonia. While Brasidas was away, Athens sent Nicias to Chalcidice in command of a large relief force which recaptured Mende and besieged Scione.

===Peace of Nicias===

The fragile truce was finally ended when Cleon resolved to restore Athenian control of the town of Amphipolis, in Macedonia. In the ensuing Battle of Amphipolis, the Spartans routed the Athenians, but both Brasidas and Cleon were killed—thereby removing the key members of the pro-war factions on both sides. Thucydides wrote that this left Pleistoanax, of Sparta, and Nicias as &quot;the foremost candidates for power in either city&quot;. Each had their reasons for desiring peace. Pleistoanax sought restoration as King of Sparta, and Nicias &quot;wished to secure his good fortune&quot;. Thucydides said Nicias wanted only to be remembered by posterity as &quot;an ever-successful statesman&quot;, and thought securing a peace would be the means to that end. 

In March 421, Nicias and Pleistoanax concluded the truce known as the Peace of Nicias, which had a fixed term of fifty years. The essence of this treaty was a partial return to the pre-war situation in that most, but not all, wartime gains were to be forfeited. For example, Amphipolis would be restored to Athens, and Pylos to Sparta, while all prisoners-of-war were to be released. Athens would continue to collect tribute from states in the Delian Confederacy, but at the rates originally agreed by Aristides in the 470s. Many of Sparta&#x27;s allies agreed to sign the peace, but Boeotia, Corinth, Elis, and Megara refused because some of their territorial claims were ignored. This meant the truce could not be expected to endure, and Bury wrote that &quot;the diplomacy of Nicias was a complete failure, so far as it aimed at ensuring an abiding peace&quot;.

Problems arose the following year when Sparta&#x27;s existing truce with Argos was about to expire, and an alliance between Argos and Athens was anticipated. Then, Amphipolis refused to accept Athenian rule. Sparta could not force Amphipolis to reconsider, and so Athens declined to meet its own treaty obligations. Sparta had a greater need for peace than Athens, and particularly desired the release of prisoners taken at the Battle of Sphacteria in 425. Nicias met with Spartan envoys and the two states agreed entrance into a defensive alliance. As a result, all captives were finally released, but Athens retained Cythera and Pylos as compensation for the loss of Amphipolis.

===Opposition to Nicias===
Cleon&#x27;s position as the leading Athenian democrat was taken by a lamp-maker called Hyperbolos who, like Cleon, was harshly criticised by Thucydides and satirised by Aristophanes. Hyperbolos, as the main opponent of Nicias and the peace party, swiftly gained support in Athens among citizens disillusioned with the peace treaty. At the same time, the anti-Athenian war party in Sparta was recovering power.

The return to conflict was hastened by the rise to prominence of Alcibiades on Athens&#x27; democratic side. Although young, and of dubious morality, he was respected as both a soldier and an orator. In 420, he stood against Nicias for election as &quot;strategos&quot;. With the peace treaty discredited, Alcibiades won the vote, and immediately urged Athens to conclude the Argive alliance. Historians A. W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey believed, as Thucydides reported, that Alcibiades was &quot;offended with the Lacedaemonians for having negotiated the treaty through Nicias and Laches, and having overlooked him on account of his youth&quot;. In 419 BC, Athens and Argos combined in an attack on Epidaurus, but Sparta intervened on behalf of Epidaurus, whereupon Athens declared that Sparta had broken the Peace of Nicias.

===Battle of Mantinea===

In 418, the political scene in Athens changed yet again, and Nicias was re-elected &quot;strategos&quot; at the expense of Alcibiades. Even so, the Argive alliance was maintained, until it was ultimately defeated in the same year at the Battle of Mantinea. Alcibiades had orchestrated an expansion of the alliance to include Elis, Mantinea, and other states in the Peloponnese, threatening Sparta&#x27;s dominance in the region. Sparta had to respond, and King Agis II led the army into Argolis during the summer of 418. He was reinforced by contingents from Boeotia and Corinth.

Various machinations occurred for several weeks until Athens sent a force under &quot;strategoi&quot; Laches and Nicostratus into Arcadia, with the intention of capturing pro-Spartan Tegea. Nicias was excluded from the expedition because he opposed the Argive alliance. The Athenians encountered Agis outside Mantinea, where a closely-fought battle ensued. The Spartans had to recover from a grave tactical error which almost caused their defeat. That they were able to recover was because the Athenians failed to capitalise on their advantage—they failed to support their Argive allies when needed. Sparta went on to win the battle, killing both Athenian commanders. Thucydides asserted that Mantinea was &quot;the greatest (battle) that had occurred for a very long while among the Hellenes&quot;.

The aftermath of the battle was equally important because an oligarchy seized power in Argos and terminated its alliance with Athens. Instead, Argos signed a new alliance with Sparta, whose military reputation had been restored. Other states including Achaea, Elis, and Mantinea followed suit, and Athens was once again isolated on the mainland.

===Ostracism of Hyperbolos===

Mantinea was a disaster for Athens and, in 417, a complex power struggle developed between Hyperbolos on one side and Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders. Plutarch was of the view that the Athenians were so angered by this cynical manoeuvring that the ostracism was never to be used again.

Bury observed that Nicias had hitherto been Athens&#x27; &quot;champion of peace&quot;, but the machinations of Hyperbolos had brought him into co-operation, if not outright collaboration, with Alcibiades. Nicias was then roused to undertake fresh military enterprises, and he led an expedition to Chalcidice with the intention of retaking Amphipolis, but the attempt failed.

==The Sicilian Expedition (415–413 BC)==

===Background===
Athens had observed the development of Greek communities in Sicily and South Italy since the early years of the 5th century BC, but had not formed any definite policy on the regions other than, as always, to uphold the interests of Ionian colonies over those of the Dorians. In Sicily, however, the Dorian cities were powerful, especially the Corinthian sea-power of Syracuse. In 416, a war broke out between the Sicilian cities of Segesta (&quot;Egesta&quot;) and Selinus. Supported by democrats in Leontini, Segesta appealed to Athens for help. An embassy was sent to assess the situation and, in 415, the &quot;ecclesia&quot; debated whether to assist.

===Preparations===
Segesta had promised to finance a military expedition and, after the Athenian embassy reported that Segesta was a rich source of silver, Alcibiades led the calls for one to be mounted. Nicias warned against it. He was wary of the enormous cost of a really efficient expedition, which would need to be large-scale, and the fact that Athens would be entering unknown territory. Alcibiades won the support of the assembly, but they did not trust him with sole command and decided that Lamachus and, disastrously in view of his opposition, Nicias should accompany him. A similar compromise had brought disaster in 418, and it would do the same in Sicily.

The expedition was ready to sail in the summer of 415. Initially, the fleet was to be sixty triremes but Nicias wanted substantially more. According to Plutarch, the increase was to &quot;140 triremes, 5,100 hoplites, and about 1,300 archers, slingers, and light armed men&quot;. However, that contradicts Thucydides a little. He says there were 134 triremes, plus a host of attendant vessels carrying food, tools and tradesmen. He agrees with Plutarch that there were 5,100 hoplites, but says the total number of combatants was 30,000. Thucydides underlined his analysis with the comment: &quot;Such was the strength of the first armament that sailed over for the war&quot;. Bury has exaggerated his translation somewhat by having Thucydides say: &quot;no armament so magnificent had ever before been sent out by a single Greek state&quot;.

On arrival in Sicily, the Athenians discovered that their envoys had been tricked because Segesta was not at all rich. Even so, Nicias and his colleagues decided against abandoning the mission. Lamachus, who was a professional soldier, called for an immediate attack on Syracuse. Alcibiades wanted a diplomatic effort first, to win support from other Ionian cities, and Nicias, exercising his usual caution, leaned towards Alcibiades—a handful of Sicilian cities agreed to support the Athenians, but little was achieved militarily.

===Recall of Alcibiades and death of Lamachus===
It was at this point, towards the end of 415, that a mandate arrived from Athens to recall Alcibiades, who had been accused of impiety, a capital offence if found guilty. Alciabides escaped his escort and went into exile. The &quot;ecclesia&quot; condemned him to death &quot;in absentia&quot;, and Alcibiades offered his services to Sparta. He convinced the Spartans that Athens planned to invade the Peloponnese after the army returned from Sicily. Sparta sent reinforcements to Syracuse under the command of their general Gylippus.

Alciabides&#x27; departure left Nicias in charge of the expedition&#x27;s diplomatic and political activities. As usual, he put caution before enterprise, and no progress was made before winter. Meanwhile, Syracuse prepared for the inevitable conflict, which began in the spring of 414. Lamachus launched a surprise attack from the coast to overrun a range of hills called the Epipolae, north and north-west of Syracuse. The plan was to circumvallate the city on its northern side while blockading the Great Harbour, a large bay to the south. The vital part of Lamachus&#x27; plan was the northern arm of the wall from the Epipolae to the coast north of Syracuse. With the hills and the harbour under Athenian control, completion of the north wall would have isolated Syracuse. Anticipating this, the Syracusans hastily built defences which the Athenians attacked and destroyed. This forced the Syracusans back into the city but, disastrously for Athens, Lamachus was killed to leave Nicias in sole command of all operations.

===&quot;Gross neglect&quot;===
Crucially, Nicias neglected the northern arm of the wall to concentrate on the southern blockade, despite knowing that aid for Syracuse was coming from Sparta and the Peloponnese. When Gylippus arrived, he saw the urgent need for support from other Dorian cities, and successfully completed alliances with Gela, Himera, and Selinus. Realising the extent of Nicias&#x27; negligence, he led his followers through the northern gap and entered Syracuse unopposed. Gylippus shared command with his Syracusan counterpart Hermocrates, and immediately ordered construction of a northern cross-wall to maintain the gap. The move was a success and left the Athenians confined to the south, unable to prevent the flow of reinforcements in the north. Next, Gylippus captured the Epipolae, which he fortified far to the west. Failure to complete the northern wall was Nicias&#x27; greatest blunder, and Bury said he was guilty of &quot;gross neglect&quot;.

Nicias compounded his error by remaining inactive through the winter of 414–413. His army and fleet held territory to the west and south of Syracuse, and Nicias was satisfied to remain in his headquarters on the fortified promontory of Plemmyrium (now Plemmirio), which is a few miles south of Syracuse. Gylippus, by contrast, was extremely busy. Knowing that the fleet was Athens&#x27; key advantage, he ordered the construction of ships throughout the winter. Over eighty were complete by spring. These Syracusan ships were smaller and more mobile than the Athenian triremes. Anticipating combat in the narrow space of the Great Harbour, the Syracusans built short, heavy vessels needing less space to manoeuvre. Meanwhile, more Sicilian and Peloponnesian contingents arrived to support Syracuse.

===Appeal for reinforcements===

Nicias was aware of the Syracusan build-up and sent an urgent appeal to Athens for extra forces. A second expedition of 73 vessels and 5,000 soldiers, under the generals Demosthenes and Eurymedon, was sent in the spring of 413. Before they arrived, Gylippus attacked Plemmyrium by land and sea. Athens won the naval clash, but lost Plemmyrium to Gylippus&#x27; army. Nicias led his land forces to their fortifications west of Syracuse and waited there for the reinforcements. Gylippus, however, was not waiting, and launched a second double offensive. This time, his army failed and his navy won—the new, mobile ships proving their suitability for the narrow waters of the Grand Harbour.

In August, the relief force arrived and Demosthenes immediately proposed a night attack on the Epipolae. This began well, but ended as a rout with heavy losses. Demosthenes declared that it was time for the Athenians to withdraw from Sicily. But, Nicias refused. He had been averse to attack Syracuse in the first place when, unprepared, it could have been easily defeated; now, with victory out of the question, he would not leave because he feared disgrace.

===Eclipse and death===
There was a delay until the arrival in Syracuse of another large contingent of reinforcements. Nicias then agreed that the Athenians must withdraw. On 27 August, the night of their proposed departure, there was an eclipse of the full moon. One characteristic of the pious Nicias was his blind faith in omens. He was foremost in pronouncing the eclipse as an evil omen, and again delayed the Athenian withdrawal, this time fatally.

On 3 September, the Syracusans and their allies attacked the Athenian fleet and won a great victory. Eurymedon was killed. With Athenian morale crushed, the Syracusans raised a boom across the mouth of the Great Harbour. The Athenians tried to break out, and the decisive battle was fought on 9 September. The fleet was comprehensively defeated, and the army had to withdraw inland. Hermocrates had managed to blockade most westward routes and, on 18 September, the Athenians were surrounded at the Assinaros river. Nicias surrendered to Gylippus, but the Spartan could not alter the intent of the Syracusans.

Large numbers of Athenians were massacred, others were enslaved, and some were imprisoned. Nicias and Demosthenes were among the latter. They died in prison, though it is uncertain if by execution, starvation, or torture.

==Final assessments==
It is held by Bury that the two main causes of Athens&#x27; Sicilian disaster were Nicias himself and the &quot;ecclesia&quot; which appointed him to command. Nicias was a pious conservative who invariably put caution first because he was indecisive, vacillating, and feared the consequences of failure. In Athens, all generals and politicians rose to power with the assent of the &quot;ecclesia&quot;, and Bury concludes his case by saying: &quot;In estimating the character of the Athenian people, we must not forget their choice of this hero of conscientious indecision&quot;.

Hugh Chisholm summarised Nicias by saying: &quot;At all events it is clear that the management of so great an enterprise was a task far beyond his powers. He was a man of conventional respectability and mechanical piety, without the originality which was required to meet the crisis which faced him&quot;.

Having considered why the Syracusans killed Nicias, Thucydides said: &quot;This or the like was the cause of the death of a man who, of all the Hellenes in my time, least deserved such a fate, seeing that the whole course of his life had been regulated with strict attention to virtue&quot;.

<text>Frank Wellington Wess (January 4, 1922 – October 30, 2013) was an American jazz saxophonist and flutist. He was renowned for his extensive solo work; however, he was also remembered for his time playing with Count Basie&#x27;s band during the early 1950s into the early 1960s. Critic Scott Yanow described him as one of the premier proteges of Lester Young, and a leading jazz flutist of his era—using the latter instrument to bring new colors to Basie&#x27;s music.

== Early Life ==
Wess was born in Kansas City, Missouri. Since he was young, Wess grew up listening to music. His mother was one of his major influences as she would take him to watch performers like Roland Hayes and Ida Cox. While speaking to his father, who was a school principal in Oklahoma, on a separate occasion, he discovered that his mother had wanted him to become a musician for a long time. Up until that pivotal moment, Wess had viewed his interactions with his mother as bonding where she emphasized the importance of being aware of culture. Before realizing that jazz was his calling, he had other interests. To name a few, Wess aspired to be a cabinetmaker and then a dentist.

Wess grew up loving the saxophone, specifically the tenor saxophone and alto saxophone. He had asked his mother for one since he was young, and she would always tell him, &quot;Wait till you&#x27;re ten years old.&quot; He believed that this life truly started when he turned ten years old as that marked the start of his lengthy music career. Wess was drawn to the instrument as it was &quot;closely related to the human voice.&quot; In his eyes, the saxophone was an instrument that was relatively easy to learn, but difficult to master. In an interview with the National Endowment for the Arts, he said, &quot;...if you can play it, it sounds good, you know. Lots of instruments, you put a whole lot into it and it still doesn&#x27;t sound too good.&quot; When he began playing the saxophone, he took influence from the sound of the horn.

Wess began with classical music training and played in Oklahoma in high school. He would travel around with the All-State High School Orchestra to perform. In 1935, Wess and his family moved to Washington D.C.. At this time, he had not been playing any longer as burnout had gotten the best of him, causing him to grow &quot;tired of the music.&quot; Having that significant change in scenery revitalized and rekindled Wess&#x27;s passion for playing music. During lunch time at his high school, students would host jam sessions in the orchestra. Billy Taylor was a student at his high school during that period of time. These sessions lit up that spark in Wess that made him start playing again. He experienced a shift in preferences as he opted to begin playing jazz. To be more specific, he played a big band style of jazz.

Living in Washington D.C. put him in proximity to Baltimore, Maryland, a city that marked a turning point in his young career. During the summer of 1938, Wess performed at a club in Baltimore with a group called the Hardy Brothers. He had two opening numbers in the same week, which gave him a boost of confidence. The next week, he performed another opening number at the Royal Theater, which only gave him more confidence to keep going.

== World War II and The 1940s ==
In 1941, Wess became a member of the U.S. Army. His ROTC bandleader had been recruiting eligible young people who could play music professionally. He would serve as an assistant bandleader that played a variety of music - Viennese waltzes, vaudeville, classical and marching band to name a few. It was a 17-piece swing band, and they were sent to Africa in 1942. During that tour, they performed in Dakar, Casablanca, Monrovia, Tlemcen, and Algiers. During their first gig, they played for a group of Americans, Germans, and British. The highlight of Wess&#x27;s time with the Army Band was accompanying Josephine Baker on tours for the Allied Power&#x27;s troops.

Shortly upon returning from his time in the Army in 1944, Wess joined the Billy Eckstine and his orchestra. They had known each other before Wess went off to the War. At one point, Wess went to go see Eckstine at the theater; during this interaction, Eckstine said, &quot;look, my tenor player is going into the army. Come on with me.&quot; This interaction was fortunate for Wess, as this orchestra was legendary for being the first big band that played a new style of jazz known as bebop. Moreover, Billy Eckstine&#x27;s Orchestra included pioneers for this new style of jazz: Fats Navarro, Miles Davis, Howard McGhee, Dexter Gordon, Gene Ammons, Leo Parker, Tommy Potter, Art Blakely. However, this stint did not last for too long as the orchestra disbanded in 1947.

As a result of the disbanding of the Billy Eckstine Orchestra, Wess would proceed to play with the orchestras of Eddie Heywood, Lucky Millinder, and Bullmoose Jackson. Like with Eckstine, these stints were also short-lived as by 1949, Wess burned out again from the stress of being on the road for so much time. In addition, he was fed up with the maltreatment from society during this time due to his race. As a result, Wess would move back to Washington D.C. to enroll at the Modern School of Music in pursuit of a Bachelor&#x27;s of Music degree. During this time, he re-discovered the flute. In high school, Wess&#x27;s orchestra teacher gave him a flute, but he did not have anyone to teach him how to properly play it. However, this school had teachers from the National Symphony, so this represented a chance to learn the flute.

== Count Basie and The &quot;New Testament&quot; Band ==
Because of Wess&#x27;s time with Billy Eckstine, he had the opportunity to interact with Count Basie. Eckstine had recommended him to Basie, and he tried recruiting Wess for a couple of years. However, he would consistently refuse to join the band as he did not want to leave school just to go back on the road as he had already grown tired of it, thus his motive for going to school in the first place. At the end of his time in school, Basie called him and said he could help get Wess more exposure. Wess&#x27;s only condition was that he needed a salary, and Basie agreed to pay him what he was asking for.

Wess played a pivotal role in the formation of Count Basie&#x27;s orchestra as he recruited the following musicians: Thad Jones, Bill Hughes, Eddie Jones, Al Aarons, and Eric Dixon. Together, this group of legendary musicians formed Count Basie&#x27;s &quot;New Testament&quot; band. Throughout the years, other musicians came and went. Wess&#x27;s versatility as an artist allowed him to play the flute, alto saxophone, and tenor saxophone. Basie&#x27;s leadership style was unorthodox as he never rehearsed with the band, but rather, he would just sit and listen. Wess and his fellow musicians were the ones who decided on the arrangements. However, this approach to leadership allowed Basie to be aware of everything. He would have an eye on everything and knew what was occurring in the musicians&#x27; personal lives. While many could not comprehend Basie&#x27;s approach, this allowed the members of the band to truly get to know each other so they could stay around long enough so that it translated into cohesive music pieces.

During his time with Count Basie&#x27;s band, Wess developed a close connection with Frank Foster. There was a lot of interplay between both of the musicians in the various performances, which displayed how they had developed a personal relationship. This flourishing friendship displayed how Basie&#x27;s leadership style had encouraged the musicians to form a deeper connection with each other.

When it came to instrumentation, Wess opted for the tenor saxophone and flute. This was critical in helping establish the swing in the orchestra&#x27;s music, a component that Count Basie highly valued. For Wess, he felt that swing was important for anyone who wanted to play jazz. There had to be a constant pulse throughout the song. The musicians have to truly play together; they need to hear each other so that their instincts can help guide them on how to play next. Again, having that sort of connection points back to how Count Basie had led the band. In 1957, Wess willingly changed to playing the alto saxophone as the band had added Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis.

In 1964, Wess departed from Count Basie&#x27;s band.

== Post Count Basie ==
Following Wess&#x27;s departure from the &quot;New Testament&quot; band, this marked a new stage in his career. He turned to Broadway and television as his next career path. For Broadway, Wess was a part of the pit bands for the shows &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, and &quot;Sugar Babies&quot;. On television, he would play for &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, &quot;The David Frost Show&quot;, and &quot;The Sammy Davis Show&quot;, among others.

Wess continued to play outside of musicals and television shows. He became a sideman that was often in high demand by all sorts of musicians. It is estimated &quot;that between 1964 and 2011, he participated in sessions with around 150 different artists or ensembles, from Benny Carter to Jaco Pastorius and from Annie Ross to Diana Ross. He was also a leader and co-leader for numerous sessions for the and Savoy record labels. Often, he would actually record sessions with his former band mates from his time with Count Basie, especially with Frank Foster. Together, they recorded two albums: &quot;Two for the Blues&quot; and &quot;Frankly Speaking&quot;. Both utilized the tenor saxophone, but played with such contrasting styles. Foster utilized a more aggressive approach while Wess focused on sounding more lyrical.

Wess was a part of some additional partnerships. He was a key part of The New York Jazz Quartet along with Sir Roland Hanna on the piano, George Mraz or Ron Carter on the bass, and either Ben Riley, Richard Pratt, or Grady Tate on drums. Wess&#x27;s key was to always find a venture to keep him occupied.

At the age of 89 Frank recorded an album named &quot;Magic 101&quot;. This album comprised seven songs played by Wess&#x27;s quartet that included pianist Kenny Barron, bassist Kenny Davis, and drummer Winard Harper. Wess played the tenor saxophone throughout the song, showcasing a slower side of jazz.

The album began with a song named &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So,&quot; that showcased the swing that Wess had built his legacy on during his time with Count Basie. The second song, &quot;The Very Thought of You,&quot; was a stark contrast to how the program started as leaned towards a ballad. The third song, &quot;Pretty Lady,&quot; and the fourth one, &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine,&quot; go down the blues path as they focused more on raw emotion. The next song, &quot;Easy Living,&quot; was a way of showing the late night in a city. The album then moves to &quot;Blue Monk,&quot; to pick up the tempo and bring vibrancy to the atmosphere. Wess brought back a steady swing throughout the duration of this song. The album end&#x27;s with Wess&#x27;s solo saxophone rendition of Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;All Too Soon,&quot; where he created an intimate feeling for the listeners.

== Death ==
On October 30, 2013, Wess was in a taxi on &quot;his way to get a dialysis treatment,&quot; when he suffered a sudden heart attack. At the age of 91, he died in that cab. His health had been in decline for months, but a month before his passing, he was still playing music with his friends. His last concert had been in April in New York at the 54 Below Club. He was survived by his companion, Sara Tsutsumi, two daughters (Michele Kane and Francine Wess), two grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

Marc Loehrwald, a saxophone player, said that music had been Wess&#x27;s life. He loved having the opportunity to play with other musicians, and he would try to invite young and moved musicians to his house for a jam session. Wess ensured that his legacy lived far beyond than the confines of his own family.

He played with Booker Ervin, Charles Mingus, John Hardee, Kenny Burrell, Johnny Coles, Blue Mitchell and Dizzy Gillespie in the late 1950s, early 1960s and in the late 1970s.

<text>Route 82 is a short state highway in Union County of the US state of New Jersey. It runs southeast from an intersection with Route 124 in Springfield Township along Morris Avenue to Route 439 in the Elizabeth general area. Along the route, it serves local businesses and the main arterial of Union Township. Near its eastern terminus at Route 439, Route 82 passes through Kean University, a state college in New Jersey. Route 82 originates as one of two Route S24 alignments designated in the 1927 state highway renumbering. A spur of Route 24, it lasted for 26 years untouched until the 1953 state highway renumbering, when Union County&#x27;s Route S-24 was designated as Route 82 and a portion of Route 439. The route&#x27;s alignment has changed little since the 1953 renumbering.

== Route description ==

Route 82 begins at a traffic light complex with Route 124 eastbound and County Route 577 (CR 577) eastbound in the community of Springfield, New Jersey. The highway progresses eastward along Morris Avenue through a large business district. A short distance after, Route 82 intersects with Maple Street, which serves Route 124 westbound and the community of Maplewood. The route continues eastward along Morris Avenue, heading through the business district of Springfield. Residential homes begin to appear in the eastbound direction before the highway crosses over the Rahway River. From there, Route 82 enters Union, where it enters a large commercial district once again. During the highway&#x27;s progression eastward, Route 82 enters more residential regions, intersecting with Liberty Avenue in the northern end of Union. Liberty Avenue connects Route 82 with U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Union. The highway continues east along Morris Avenue, entering further into Union, where it serves as the main road to the community. At a fork with Elmwood Avenue, Route 82 diverts to the east along Morris, leaving the northern portion of Union.
Route 82 continues eastward as the main arterial, passing between many residential homes in both directions. The highway then enters the center of Union Township, where it intersects with CR 619 (Stuyvesant Avenue) and to the north of Friberger Park. Morris Avenue continues through a largely residential and commercial district in Union before crossing under the westbound lanes of US 22 and the eight lanes of the Garden State Parkway. Route 82 then passes under the eastbound lanes of US 22 before continuing along Morris Avenue into Union Township. A short distance later, the route approaches an intersection with a shopping mall access road before passing to the north of the local golf club, Suburban Golf. Route 82 and Morris Avenue continue eastward, passing through the middle of residential neighborhoods as a four-lane boulevard. A short distance after the golf club, the highway intersects CR 509 (Salem Avenue). From there, Route 82 becomes a divided arterial, passing to the south of Elizabeth River Park and crossing under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Lehigh Line, which also carries NJ Transit&#x27;s Raritan Valley Line. The nearby intersection for Green Lane serves the nearby Union station along the rail line. After the intersection with Green Lane, Route 82 enters the area of Kean University, which surrounds the highway in both directions. After intersecting with the university&#x27;s access roads, Route 82 crosses through a wooded area before terminating at an intersection with Route 439 (North Avenue). Morris Avenue continues eastward as CR 629.

== History ==

The alignment along Morris Avenue through Union and Springfield was originally the alignment of a Lenape trail running from Springfield to Elizabeth. It later became part of the Morris Turnpike, chartered in 1801 to run from Elizabeth to Newton. It became State Highway Route S-24, a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 24, in the 1927 state highway renumbering. This was one of two State Highway Route S-24s designated, with the other out in Warren County. Route S-24 in Union County was designated to run from Route 24 in Springfield (now Route 124) along Morris Avenue to an intersection with Route 25 in Elizabeth. (The alignment of Route 25 is now U.S. Routes 1 and 9.) At the intersection with current-day Route 439, Route S-24 turned off of current-day Route 82 and onto Route 439 southbound towards the Goethals Bridge across the Arthur Kill. Although the route remained intact for twenty-six years, the 1953 state highway renumbering occurred on January 1, and Route S-24 was re-designated as Route 82 and Route 439, while Route 24 through Springifeld remained the same. The route&#x27;s general alignment has remained virtually unchanged since the 1953 renumbering, with the highway remaining on Morris Avenue. In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Transportation was given US$800,000 in an earmark to give Route 82 roadway and intersection improvements.

<text>Route 83 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is completely within Dennis Township, New Jersey, running from an intersection with Route 47 east to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9). The route, which passes through woodland and some residential development, is also known as the Trooper Bertram T. Zimmerman III Memorial Highway in honor of a New Jersey State Police officer who was killed along Route 83 in 2004 while responding to an armed robbery.

Between 1927 and 1953, Route 83 was a part of Route 49, which originally ran south of Millville along Route 47 between Millville and South Dennis and along the entire length of Route 83. In 1953, the route became Route 83 when Route 49 was realigned to follow what was then Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe and Route 47 was aligned to follow Route S49 between South Dennis and Wildwood. In 2007, the state completed reconstruction of the intersection with Route 47 to include a traffic signal. A school bus accident has prompted the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to install a traffic signal at the Y intersection of Route 83 and US 9.

==Route description==

Route 83 begins at a traffic light with Route 47 in South Dennis, heading to the east on a four-lane divided highway. The route crosses over the Cape May Seashore Lines railroad line and narrows to a two-lane undivided highway. After this bridge, it intersects West Avenue and then crosses over County Route 628 (Dennisville Road/School House Road). Route 83 then intersects County Road, which heads west to parallel the route to the south. It later crosses Gravel Hole Road, which provides access to County Route 657 (Court House-Dennisville Road). Past that intersection, Route 83 continues to the east through a mix of residential development and woodland. It passes under a set of power lines and comes to an intersection with County Route 608 (Kings Highway). The route continues east to its eastern terminus at a signalized intersection with US 9 in Clermont.

Route 83 is a major route that provides access to the Jersey Shore resorts of Sea Isle City and Avalon from Route 47. It also serves as part of an evacuation route for Cape May County that feeds into Route 47 to provide access to inland areas in the event of a hurricane.

==History==

Route 83 was originally legislated by the Laws of 1927, Chapter 319 as a part of Route 49, which was to run from Route 4 (now US 9) in Ocean View to Route 44 in Salem. In 1940, a bridge was built over the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines railroad tracks in South Dennis. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 49 was realigned to head along Route 47 from Millville to Tuckahoe, Route 47 was realigned to head along Route 49 between Millville and South Dennis and Route S49 from South Dennis and Wildwood, and Route 83 was created along the former alignment of Route 49 between South Dennis and Clermont.

On December 12, 2004, Route 83 was dedicated as the Trooper Bertram T. Zimmerman III Memorial Highway in honor of a New Jersey State Police trooper who was killed on the route earlier in the year while responding to an armed robbery. In the 2000s, plans were made to improve the intersections at both termini of Route 83. The intersection with Route 47 saw realignment and the installation of a traffic light, along with improvements to Route 47, that cost $6.7 million and was completed in July 2007. In 2006, reconstruction of the Y intersection of US 9 and Route 83 to a T intersection and a new traffic light was planned following a school bus accident. The reconfigured intersection was completed on June 10, 2008.

<text>Cleon (; (Kleon Kleinetou Kydathinaeis), ; died 422 BC) was an Athenian general during the Peloponnesian War. He was an early representative of the commercial class in Athenian politics; which during the early Peloponnesian war was coming into prominence – although he was an aristocrat himself. He strongly advocated for an offensive war strategy and is remembered for being ruthless in carrying out his policies. He was often depicted in a negative way, predominantly by Thucydides and the comedic playwright Aristophanes, who both represent him as an unscrupulous, warmongering demagogue. Cleon was the son of Cleaenetus.

Cleon came to notice as an opponent of Pericles in the late 430s BC through his opposition to Pericles&#x27; strategy of refusing battle against the Peloponnesian League invaders in 431 BC. As a result, he found himself acting in concert with the Athenian aristocratic parties, who stood against the &quot;leaders of the demos&quot;, which included Isagoras, Miltiades, Thucydides, Nicias, Theramenes, and Pericles. In 430 BC, after the unsuccessful expedition by Pericles to the Peloponnesus, and when the city was devastated by the plague, Cleon headed the opposition to Pericles&#x27; rule. At this time, Pericles was accused by Cleon of maladministration of public money, with the result of Pericles being found guilty and removed from office. However, Pericles&#x27; setback was temporary and he was soon reinstated.

===Rise in popularity===
The death of Pericles from the plague in 429 BC left the field clear for new leadership in Athens. Hitherto Cleon had only been a vigorous opposition speaker, a trenchant critic and accuser of state officials, but he came forward as the professed champion and leader of the democracy and rapidly came to dominate Athenian politics. By the time of the Mytilenean revolt in 428/427 BC (shortly after the death of Pericles) he is described by Thucydides as &quot;...by far the most persuasive speaker in the eyes of the people.&quot; 

Although rough and unpolished, he was charismatic, with natural eloquence and a powerful voice, and he knew how to work upon the emotions of the Athenian populace. He strengthened his support amongst the poorer citizens by increasing the pay for jury work, which provided a livelihood for many of the poorer Athenians.

The fondness of the Athenians for litigation increased his power; and the practice of &quot;sycophancy&quot; (raking up material for false charges) enabled him to remove those who were likely to endanger his ascendancy. In 426 BC, Cleon brought an unsuccessful prosecution against Laches based on his generalship in the unsuccessful first Sicilian expedition. This is one of the very few times that an Athenian general escaped civil punishment for a defeat. Having no further use for his former aristocratic associates, he broke off all connection with them, and thus felt at liberty to attack the secret combinations for political purposes, the oligarchical clubs to which they mostly belonged. He was elected one of the ten &quot;strategos&quot; for 424–423 BC. Whether he also introduced a property-tax for military purposes, and even held a high position connected with the treasury, is uncertain.

===War against Sparta, subsequent death===
Cleon&#x27;s ruling principles were an inveterate hatred of the nobility, and an equal hatred of Sparta. It was mainly through him that the opportunity of concluding an honourable peace (in 425 BC) was lost, and in his determination to see Sparta defeated, often spoke of dazzling future benefits. He insisted upon Athenian security via strategic possession of territories rather than by Spartan goodwill.

In 427 BC, Cleon urged his Athenian countrymen to put to death the whole adult male population of Mytilene, which had put itself at the head of a revolt. His proposal, though at first accepted, was soon rescinded due to a protracted rebuttal by Diodotus. Nonetheless, approximately one thousand chief leaders and prominent men of Mytilene were executed. In 425 BC, Cleon reached the summit of his fame by capturing and transporting to Athens the Spartans who had been blockaded at the Battle of Sphacteria. Much of the credit was probably due to the military skill of his colleague Demosthenes (not the orator); but it was due to Cleon&#x27;s determination that the Ecclesia sent out the additional force that was needed.

It was almost certainly due to Cleon that the tribute of the &quot;allies&quot; was doubled in 425 BC. He was not re-elected as strategos for 423–22 BC after his strategy suffered a setback when Sparta invaded Amphipolis. In 422 BC, he was sent to recapture Amphipolis. This development came with the resurgence of Athenian aggressive policy toward Sparta after the revolt of Scione, an Athenian allied city. During his campaign, however, Cleon was outmanoeuvred by the Spartan general Brasidas. He was killed by a peltast when his army was routed at the Battle of Amphipolis. Brasidas also died at Amphipolis and their deaths removed the chief obstacles to peace. Thus, in 421 BC the peace of Nicias was signed.

==Aristophanes and Thucydides on Cleon==
The character of Cleon is represented by Aristophanes and Thucydides in a very unfavourable light. Their portrayals may be justified considering he instilled a feeling of mistrust within Athens through a kind of Athenian &quot;McCarthyism&quot;, caused by the excessive number of informants he employed to keep watch on the city. Yet, both have been suspected of being prejudiced witnesses: The playwright Aristophanes had a grudge against Cleon, who may have accused him before the Council of having ridiculed (in his lost play &quot;Babylonians&quot;) the policy and institutions of his city in the presence of foreigners and at the time of a great national danger. Thucydides, believing in the shortcomings of democratic government, had also been prosecuted (unjustly, his ships arriving two days after a town was occupied by Spartan forces) for military incapacity and exiled by a decree proposed by Cleon. Indeed, of all the persons who appear in Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History&quot;, Cleon is treated with the least impartiality. It is therefore possible that Cleon has had injustice done to him in the portraits handed down by these two writers.

His influence lay in his forceful and bullying style of oratory, anti-intellectual and anti-aristocratic in tone, and his populism. This might have brought him many enemies. He seems to have aimed at short-term goals, but Athens&#x27; poor stood to benefit by his policies, at the expense of heavy taxes levied onto her allies.

==In popular culture==

Cleon is featured as a major antagonist in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot;. He appears as a political adversary to Pericles using the phrase “I will make Athens great again!” He later becomes the ruler of Athens after Pericles&#x27; death, using his new position to prolong the Peloponnesian War against Sparta. It is later revealed that this is in service to the goals of the Cult of Kosmos, a secret society of which Cleon is a member that seeks to control all of Greece. The player character, together with an inner circle of allies, including Aristophanes and Herodotos, works to discredit Cleon, prompting him to personally lead the Athenian forces during the Battle of Amphipolis in order to restore his reputation, only to be killed by the protagonist in the effort.

<doc id="231339" wikidata="Q825062" url="?curid=231339" title="New Jersey Route 87">
<text>Route 87 is a state highway located in Atlantic County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs , heading north from Atlantic City at an intersection with U.S. Route 30 (US 30) to Brigantine, where it terminates at the end of the Brigantine Bridge over the Absecon Inlet, continuing as County Route 638 (CR 638). In Atlantic City, the route runs through the Marina District, which contains a few casinos, along Huron Avenue and Brigantine Boulevard. Here, Route 87 intersects with Route 187 and the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector, the latter providing a limited-access route between Route 87 and the Atlantic City Expressway. Route 87 is the only road to and from Brigantine.

What is now Route 87 was initially proposed as Route S4A in 1927, running from Tuckerton south through Brigantine to Atlantic City. The portion of this route south of Little Beach was to be built by Atlantic County; however, the state took over plans of building the road in 1938. Despite this, Route S4A was never completed between Brigantine and Little Beach, and the portion of the road that existed in Ocean County was removed from the state highway system by 1941. In 1945, Route S56 was proposed to run from Atlantic City to Brigantine along Brigantine Boulevard. Route 87 was created on its current alignment in 1953 as an unsigned route, replacing the other two routes. Previously, Route 87 split into two alignments in Atlantic City along Huron Avenue and Brigantine Boulevard; the Brigantine Boulevard alignment eventually became Route 187.

==Route description==
Route 87 begins at an intersection with US 30 in Atlantic City, heading to the northeast on Huron Avenue, an undivided road with two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. Immediately after beginning, it passes under the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector and comes to a ramp that provides access from southbound Route 87 to the southbound connector. From here, the route widens to seven lanes, with two northbound lanes and five southbound lanes. It passes by the Borgata casino, with a ramp from the casino to the northbound direction. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes under a ramp from the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector to the Borgata before heading under northbound direction of the connector. Here, a ramp from the connector provides access to Route 87. A short distance later, the route comes to the northern terminus of Route 187 and turns north to follow Brigantine Boulevard, which is a four-lane divided highway.

The route passes to the west of the Golden Nugget Atlantic City casino and comes to a ramp that provides access from northbound Route 87 to both the Golden Nugget Atlantic City and Harrah&#x27;s Atlantic City casinos before passing under the northbound Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector again. Immediately after, the route has a ramp from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound US 30. The northbound Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector parallels Route 87 to the east as it turns northeast and comes to a right-in/right-out in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah&#x27;s and Borgata. From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah&#x27;s. The northbound Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector merges onto northbound Route 87 before the route comes to a ramp that provides access to the northbound direction of the route from Harrah&#x27;s. Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge and runs along the border of Atlantic City to the northwest and Brigantine to the southeast. After crossing the Absecon Channel, the route arrives on Brigantine Island and passes through wetlands, with U-turn ramps in both directions. A short distance later, Route 87 ends and CR 638 continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Brigantine.

==History==
In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was proposed as a route running from Route 4 (now US 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach to be built by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed extension of Route S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County, known as Great Bay Boulevard, was removed from the state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now US 30), was proposed to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 between US 30 in Atlantic City and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along Brigantine Boulevard between US 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the casinos in the Marina District, and Brigantine with the Atlantic City Expressway.

<text>Route 88 is a state highway in the northern part of Ocean County, New Jersey, United States. It runs from an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9)/County Route 547 (CR 547) in Lakewood Township to an intersection with Route 35 in Point Pleasant. It is a two-lane undivided road that passes through mostly residential and commercial areas. The route intersects CR 549 in Lakewood, Route 70 in Brick Township at the former Laurelton Circle, and CR 549 Spur in Point Pleasant. The road is mentioned in the lyrics of the 1973 song &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot; by Bruce Springsteen.

The route was built as a gravel county road in 1903 and became part of pre-1927 Route 4, a route that was to run from Absecon to Rahway, in 1916. US 9 was designated along this stretch of road in 1926 when the U.S. Highway System was created. A year later, in 1927, this portion of pre-1927 Route 4 became a part of Route 35, a route from Lakewood to South Amboy. By the 1940s, US 9 was moved off this road to follow its current alignment between Lakewood and South Amboy. In 1953, Route 35 was realigned to follow a portion of Route 37 between Point Pleasant and Seaside Heights, and Route 88 was designated along the former alignment of Route 35 between Lakewood and Point Pleasant. The Laurelton Circle at Route 70, built in 1937, was replaced with the current intersection by the 1990s.

==Route description==

Route 88 begins at an intersection with US 9 and CR 547 in Lakewood Township, and heads eastward on Main Street, a two-lane undivided road. The road heads through the downtown, passing south of NJ Transit&#x27;s Lakewood Bus Terminal and crossing the Southern Secondary railroad line operated by the Delaware and Raritan River Railroad, before heading into wooded residential areas, where it becomes Ocean Avenue at the Pearl Street intersection before coming to a junction with CR 20. Past this intersection, the route heads through a mix of residences and businesses with some woodland. Route 88 intersects CR 623, where it heads through a commercial district, crossing CR 549. A short distance later, the route passes under the Garden State Parkway without an interchange before crossing the Metedeconk River into Brick Township. Here, the road heads through a mix of residential and commercial areas, intersecting CR 64, CR 44, CR 40, and CR 16. It turns south and passes west of Ocean University Medical Center, intersecting CR 40 before crossing Route 70.
Past this intersection, Route 88 briefly splits into a one-way pair. Here, the eastbound direction follows Princeton Avenue southeast before turning north onto Post Road, with CR 630 continuing along Princeton Avenue, while westbound Route 88 follows Princeton Post Road. Past the one-way pair, the route continues northeast on Princeton Post Road, which passes by numerous businesses. Along this stretch of road Route 88 intersects several county routes, including CR 64 again, CR 42, CR 10, and CR 54. The route heads into Point Pleasant, where it intersects CR 56 before crossing Beaver Dam Creek and becoming Sea Avenue. From here, the road crosses CR 632 before heading east and intersecting CR 549 Spur and CR 630. After this intersection, Route 88 crosses the Point Pleasant Canal (part of the Intracoastal Waterway) on the Veterans Memorial Bridge, a lift bridge, before heading east through residential areas with some businesses. Here, the road intersects CR 633/CR 10, CR 6, and CR 604. A short distance later, Route 88 ends at an intersection with Route 35 on the border of Point Pleasant and Point Pleasant Beach.

==History==

What is modern-day Route 88 was first built as a hard gravel county road back in 1903, the first such road in Ocean County. This road was incorporated into the Camp Dix Way, an auto trail running from Camden to Seaside Heights. In 1916, this road was designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 4, a state road that was to run from Absecon north to Rahway. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 9 was also designated along this route, running concurrent with Route 4. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering a year later, Route 35 replaced this portion of pre-1927 Route 4 as part of its route from Lakewood to South Amboy. By the 1940s, US 9 was moved off this portion of Route 35 to follow its current alignment along Route 4 between Lakewood and South Amboy. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 35 was realigned to follow what was a part of Route 37 between Point Pleasant and Seaside Heights, and Route 88 was designated along the former alignment of Route 35 between Lakewood and Point Pleasant. A traffic circle called the Laurelton Circle, built in 1937, once existed at the intersection with Route 70; it was replaced with its current configuration by the 1990s. The current lift bridge that crosses the Point Pleasant Canal, the Veterans Memorial Bridge, opened in 1986 replacing an obsolete bascule lift bridge completed in 1928.

Route 88 was referred to in the 1973 song &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot; by Bruce Springsteen on his debut album &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot;.

<text>Lavrio, Lavrion or Laurium (; (later ); from Middle Ages until 1908: Εργαστήρια &quot;Ergastiria&quot;) is a town in southeastern part of Attica, Greece. It is part of Athens metropolitan area and the seat of the municipality of Lavreotiki. Laurium was famous in Classical antiquity for its silver mines, which was one of the chief sources of revenue of the Athenian state. The metallic silver was mainly used for coinage. The Archaeological Museum of Lavrion shows much of the story of these mines.

It is located about 60 km SE of Athens city center, SE of Keratea and N of Cape Sounio. Laurium is situated on a bay overlooking the island of Makronisos (ancient times: Helena) in the east. The port is in the middle and gridded streets cover the residential area of Lavrio. GR-89 runs through Lavrio and ends south in Sounio.

==History==


The modern town of Lavrio is at the site of the ancient village of Thoricus; its name is taken from that of the entire region of the Mines of Laurium.

The earliest evidence for mining dates to the beginning of the Bronze Age, ca. 3200 BC.

Systematic exploitation of mineral resources seem to have begun in the 6th century BC under Peisistratus. 
After the battle of Marathon, Themistocles persuaded the Athenians to devote the anticipated revenue derived from a major silver vein strike in the mines of Laurion circa 483 BC to expanding the Athenian fleet to 200 triremes, and thus laid the foundation of the Athenian naval power. The mines, which were the property of the state, were usually farmed out for a certain fixed sum and a percentage on the working; slave labour was exclusively employed. An unrecorded number were children. It was a miserable, dangerous, and brief life. As many as 20,000 slaves were employed at the height of the mining. A silver mint (Argyrocopeum) was at Laurion.

Towards the end of the 5th century, the output fell, partly owing to the Spartan occupation of Decelea. But the mines continued to be worked, though Strabo records that in his time the tailings were being worked over, and Pausanias speaks of the mines as a thing of the past. The ancient workings, consisting of shafts and galleries for excavating the ore, and washing tables for concentrating the ore, may still be seen at many locations. There were well engineered tanks and reservoirs to collect rainwater for washing the ore since abundant supplies from streams or rivers was impossible at the site.

The mines were reworked in the late 19th century by French and Greek companies, but mainly for lead, manganese and cadmium. In 1896 a strike from the miners was violently confronted by the mining company&#x27;s guards resulting in the death of two workers. The miners responded by destroying the company&#x27;s offices and killing the guards. The government then sent police forces to support the company&#x27;s interests against the strikers. Further clashes between workers and the police occurred to which the government replied by sending the military against the striking workers resulting in more workers&#x27; deaths. The strike ended violently with most of the strikers&#x27; demands not being fulfilled and with a military force being permanently established to patrol the miners. 

The Mineralogical Museum of Lavrion comprises samples of minerals from the region of Lavrion.
==Climate==

Lavrio, owing to its location in the southern tip of the Athens Riviera, has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;), closely bordering a hot-summer mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;) climate. It has mild winters and hot summers, with particularly warm summer nights. The summer highs are 2 °C lower than in Piraeus and 4 °C lower than in downtown Athens. The driest months are July and August while the rainiest period is during December and January. Lavrio falls in hardiness zone 10b. According to the station of the National Observatory of Athens, Lavrio has never recorded an air frost.

==Facilities==

The Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport is 35 km away from Lavrio or about 30 minutes drive. 
Lavrio is connected to Athens by car using the Lavrio/Sounio Leoforos (Highway) and then Attiki Odos. This trip takes about an hour. 
A quite convenient solution to go to Athens is to &quot;park and drive&quot;. Drive from Lavrio to Koropi Train Station and there take the suburban railway or metro that goes straight to Athens center. (30 minutes drive + 30 minutes train)

Lavrio was the terminal station of the Athens-Lavrion Railway, which was abandoned in 1957.

The mining town of Laurium, Michigan was named after the famous Greek Laurium.

==Sports==
Laurium hosts the football club Olympiacos Laurium, which played in the Gamma Ethniki in the past, and the basketball club Lavrio B.C., which plays in the Basket League.

<text>The Mishnah Berurah ( &quot;Clear Teaching&quot;) is a work of &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (Poland, 1838–1933, also known as &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;). It is a commentary on &quot;Orach Chayim&quot;, the first section of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; which deals with laws of prayer, synagogue, Shabbat and holidays, summarizing the opinions of the &quot;Acharonim&quot; (post-Medieval rabbinic authorities) on that work.

The title comes from Talmud Bavli Masechet Shabbat 138b-139a, &quot;They will rove, seeking the word of the LORD, but they will not find it (Amos 8:12) -- they will not find clear teaching and clear law in one place.&quot;

==Contents==

The &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; is traditionally printed in 6 volumes alongside selected other commentaries. The work provides simple and contemporary explanatory remarks and citations to daily aspects of &quot;halakha&quot;. It is widely used as a reference and has mostly supplanted the Chayei Adam and the Aruch HaShulchan as the primary authority on Jewish daily living among Ashkenazi Jews, particularly those closely associated with &quot;haredi&quot; &quot;yeshivas&quot;. The &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; is accompanied by additional in-depth glosses called &quot;Be&#x27;ur Halakha&quot;, a reference section called &quot;Sha&#x27;ar Hatziyun&quot; (these two were also written by the &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;), and additional commentaries called &quot;Be&#x27;er Hagolah&quot;, &quot;Be&#x27;er Heitev&quot;, and &quot;Sha&#x27;arei Teshuvah&quot;.

The Mishnah Berurah&#x27;s &quot;literary style can be described as follows: In relation to a given law of the &quot;Shulhan Aruch&quot;, he raises a particular case with certain peculiarities that may change the law; then, he enumerates the opinions of the &quot;Ahronim&quot; (the later authorities, of the 16th century and on) on that case, from the most lenient to the most stringent ; and finally, he decides between them... Having displayed what we may call the &quot;leniency-stringency spectrum&quot;, [he] actually offers the reader an array of conduct options from which he may &quot;pick&quot; the one that seems right for him. This choice is not altogether free, since [he] shows a clear inclination to one side of the spectrum - the stringent - and encourages the reader to follow it, but still, the soft language of the ruling suggests that if one follows the other side of the spectrum, the lenient, he will not sin, since there are trustworthy authorities that may back his choice.&quot;

Not all of the Mishnah Brurah was written by Kagan: some parts were instead written by his son or various students, which accounts for the existence of several contradictions between different rulings in the text.

==Impact==
&quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; has come to play a significant role in the study and practice of contemporary Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews. According to some, it is the &quot;posek acharon&quot; whose rulings are the last word on halachic issues it addresses. As such, the &quot;yeshivish&quot; community tends to follow its rulings almost exclusively. However, R&#x27; Yosef Eliyahu Henkin ruled that the Aruch haShulchan should be regarded as more authoritative for a number of reasons: it is the later of the two codes; it covers the entire Shulchan Aruch and not just Orach Chaim; it takes Jewish custom into account; it was written by a practicing rabbi who thus had more experience with halachic dilemmas. R&#x27; Moshe Feinstein also preferred the &quot;Aruch Hashulchan&quot;, for the last of these reasons. Indeed, on a number of key issues, common Orthodox practice does not follow the Mishnah Berurah&#x27;s stringencies.

&quot;Mishnah Berurah Yomit&quot; is a daily study programme initiated by &quot;Vaad Daas Halacha&quot; and the Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation. The study program proceeds either on a 2½-year cycle (&quot;Daf a Day&quot;) or a 5-year cycle (&quot;Amud a Day&quot;) and includes a focus on each &quot;Yom Tov&quot; (festival) in the 30 preceding days.

<text>1,837 Seconds of Humor is the debut album of Ray Stevens, released in 1962. The front of the album shows a sheik that rides a camel, which is a reference to Stevens&#x27; song &quot;Ahab the Arab.&quot; All of the material on the album was written by Ray Stevens and published by Lowery Music Co., Inc. (BMI). The back of the album cover contains an essay of biographical information of Stevens from his youth in his hometown of Clarkdale, Georgia to the time of this album&#x27;s release and gives brief descriptions of all the songs on the album. Four singles were lifted from the album: &quot;Jeremiah Peabody&#x27;s Poly Unsaturated Quick Dissolving Fast Acting Pleasant Tasting Green and Purple Pills&quot; (his first Top 40 hit), &quot;Scratch My Back (I Love It)&quot; (which failed to chart), &quot;Ahab the Arab&quot; (his major breakthrough hit and his biggest until his 1970 hit &quot;Everything Is Beautiful&quot;), and &quot;Further More.&quot;

The album was re-released by Pickwick Records in 1971 under the title &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Show&quot;. This version of the album has a rearrangement of the track listing and does not include the songs &quot;The Rockin&#x27; Boppin&#x27; Waltz&quot; and &quot;Further More.&quot; The front of this album cover contains two faces of Stevens making a huge smile, one on the top left and the other on the top right; the center of the front album shows a sketch of Stevens making the exact smile along with references to a few of the songs on the album. The back of the album cover for the re-released version also contains exactly the same essay as the original album.

<doc id="231349" wikidata="Q12410157" url="?curid=231349" title="Sephardic law and customs">
<text>Sephardic law and customs are the law and customs of Judaism which are practiced by Sephardim or Sephardic Jews ( &quot;Jews of Spain&quot;); the descendants of the historic Jewish community of the Iberian Peninsula, what is now Spain and Portugal. Many definitions of &quot;Sephardic&quot; also include Mizrahi Jews, most of whom follow the same traditions of worship as those which Sephardic Jews follow. The Sephardi Rite is not a denomination nor a movement like Orthodox Judaism, Reform Judaism, and other Ashkenazi Rite worship traditions. Sephardim are communities with distinct cultural, juridical and philosophical traditions.
Sephardim are the descendants of Jews from the Iberian Peninsula. They may be divided into the families that left Spain during the Expulsion of 1492 and those families that remained in Spain as crypto-Jews, fleeing in the following few centuries. In religious parlance as well as in modern Israel, the term is broadly used for all Jews who have Ottoman or other Asian or North African backgrounds, whether or not they have any historical link to Spain, but some prefer to distinguish Sephardim proper from Mizraḥi Jews.
Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews have similar religious practices. Whether or not they are &quot;Spaniard Jews,&quot; they are all &quot;Jews of the Spanish rite.&quot; There are three reasons for this convergence, which are explored in more detail below:
*Both groups follow the Halakha, without those customs specific to the Ashkenazi tradition.
*The Spanish rite was an offshoot of the Babylonian-Arabic family of Jewish rites and retained a family resemblance to the other rites of that family.
*Following the expulsion the Spanish exiles took a leading role in the Jewish communities of Western Asia (the Middle East) and North Africa, who modified their rites to bring them still nearer to the Spanish rite, which by then was regarded as the standard.

==Law==

Jewish law is based on the Torah, as interpreted and supplemented by the Talmud. The Babylonian Talmud in its final form dates from the Sasanian Empire and was the product of the Talmudic academies in Babylonia.
===The Gaonic period===
The two principal colleges of Sura and Pumbedita survived well into the Muslim world. Their presidents, known as Geonim, together with the Exilarch or Leader of the Jews of Lower Mesopotamia, were recognised by the Abbasid Caliphate as the supreme authority over the Jews of the Arab world. The Geonim provided written answers to questions on Halakha worldwide published in collections of responsa and enjoyed high authority. The Geonim also produced handbooks such as the &quot;Halachot Pesuqot&quot; by Yehudai ben Nahman  and the &quot;Halachot Gedolot&quot; by Simeon Kayyara.
===Spain===
The learning of the Geonim was transmitted through the scholars of Kairouan, notably Chananel ben Chushiel and Nissim ben Jacob, to Spain, where it was used by Isaac Alfasi in his &quot;Sefer ha-Halakhot&quot; (code of Jewish law), which took the form of an edited and abridged Talmud. This, in turn, formed the basis for the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides. A feature of these early Tunisian and Spanish schools was a willingness to use the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian.
Developments in France and Germany were somewhat different. They respected the rulings of the Geonim but also had strong local customs. The Tosafists did their best to explain the Talmud in a way consistent with these customs. A theory grew that custom trumps law (see minhag): this had some Talmudic support but was not nearly so prominent in Arabic-speaking countries as it was in Europe. Books on Ashkenazi custom were written by authors such as Yaakov Moelin. Further instances of Ashkenazi custom were contributed by the penitential manual of Eleazar of Worms and some additional stringencies on sheḥitah (the slaughter of animals) formulated in Jacob Weil&#x27;s &quot;Sefer Sheḥitot u-Bediqot&quot;.

The learning of the Tosafists, but not the literature on Ashkenazi customs as such, was imported into Spain by Asher ben Jehiel, a German-born scholar who became chief rabbi of Toledo and the author of the &quot;Hilchot ha-Rosh&quot; - an elaborate Talmudic commentary, which became the third of the great Spanish authorities after Alfasi and Maimonides. A more popular résumé, known as the Arba&#x27;ah Turim, was written by his son, Jacob ben Asher, though he did not agree with his father on all points.
The Tosafot were also used by scholars of the Catalan school, such as Nahmanides and Solomon ben Adret, who were also noted for their interest in Kabbalah. For a while, Spain was divided between the schools: in Catalonia the rulings of Nahmanides and ben Adret were accepted, in Castile those of the Asher family, and in Valencia those of Maimonides. (Maimonides&#x27; rulings were also accepted in most of the Arab world, especially Yemen, Egypt and the Land of Israel.)

===After the expulsion===
Following the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, Jewish law was codified by Yosef Karo in his &quot;Bet Yosef&quot;, which took the form of a commentary on the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;, and &quot;Shulḥan Arukh&quot;, which presented the same results in the form of a practical abridgement. He consulted most of the authorities available to him but generally arrived at a pragmatic decision by following the majority among the three great Spanish authorities Alfasi, Maimonides, and Asher ben Yeḥiel, unless most of the other authorities were against them.
Karo did not consciously intend to exclude non-Sephardi authorities. Still, he considered that the Ashkenazi school, so far as it had anything to contribute to Halakha as opposed to purely Ashkenazi custom, was adequately represented by Asher. However, since Alfasi and Maimonides generally agree, the overall result was overwhelmingly Sephardi in flavour, though in several cases, Karo set the result of this consensus aside and ruled in favour of the Catalan school (Nahmanides and Solomon ben Adret), some of whose opinions had Ashkenazi origins. Today, the &quot;Bet Yosef&quot; is accepted by Sephardim as the leading authority in Jewish law, subject to minor variants drawn from the rulings of later rabbis accepted in particular communities.

The Polish rabbi Moses Isserles, while acknowledging the merits of the &quot;Shulḥan Arukh,&quot; felt that it did not do justice to Ashkenazi scholarship and practice. He accordingly composed a series of glosses setting out all respects in which Ashkenazi practice differs, and the composite work is today accepted as the leading work on Ashkenazi halakha. Isserles felt free to differ from Karo on particular points of law. In principle, he accepted Karo&#x27;s view that the Sephardic practice set out in the &quot;Shulḥan Arukh&quot; represents standard Jewish law while the Ashkenazi practice is essentially a local custom.
So far, then, it is meaningless to speak of &quot;Sephardic custom&quot;: all that is meant is Jewish law without the particular customs of the Ashkenazim. For this reason, the law accepted by other non-Ashkenazi communities, such as the Italian and Yemenite Jews, is basically similar to that of the Sephardim. There are of course customs peculiar to particular countries or communities within the Sephardic world, such as Syria and Morocco.

An important body of customs grew up in the Kabbalistic circle of Isaac Luria and his followers in Safed, and many of these have spread to communities throughout the Sephardi world: this is discussed further in the Liturgy section below. In some cases they are accepted by Greek and Turkish Sephardim and Mizrahi Jews but not by Western communities such as the Spanish and Portuguese Jews. These are customs in the true sense: in the list of usages below they are distinguished by an L sign.
==Liturgy==
===Origins===
For the outline and early history of the Jewish liturgy, see the articles on Siddur and Jewish services. At an early stage, a distinction was established between the Babylonian ritual and that used in the land of Israel, as these were the two main centres of religious authority: there is no complete text of the Palestinian rite, though some fragments have been found in the Cairo Genizah.

Most scholars maintain that Sephardic Jews are inheritors of the religious traditions of the great Babylonian Jewish academies, and that Ashkenazi Jews are descendants of those who initially followed the Judaean or Galilaean Jewish religious traditions. Others, such as Moses Gaster, maintain precisely the opposite. To put the matter into perspective it must be emphasized that all Jewish liturgies in use in the world today are in substance Babylonian, with a small number of Palestinian usages surviving the process of standardization: in a list of differences preserved from the time of the Geonim, most of the usages recorded as Palestinian are now obsolete. (In the list of usages below, Sephardic usages inherited from Palestine are marked P, and instances where the Sephardic usage conforms to the Babylonian while the Ashkenazi usage is Palestinian are marked B.) By the 12th century, as a result of the efforts of Babylonian leaders such as Yehudai ben Nahman and Pirqoi ben Baboi, The communities of Palestine, and Diaspora communities such as Kairouan that had historically followed Palestinian usages, had adopted Babylonian rulings in most respects, and Jews accepted Babylonian authority throughout the Arabic-speaking world.

Early attempts at standardizing the liturgy that have been preserved include, in chronological order, those of Amram Gaon, Saadia Gaon, Shelomoh ben Natan of Sijilmasa (in Morocco) and Maimonides. All of these were based on the legal rulings of the Geonim but show a recognisable evolution towards the current Sephardi text. The liturgy in use in Visigothic Spain is likely to have belonged to a Palestinian-influenced European family, together with the Italian and Provençal, and more remotely the Old French and Ashkenazi rites, but as no liturgical materials from the Visigothic era survive we cannot know for certain. From references in later treatises such as the &quot;Sefer ha-Manhig&quot; by Rabbi Abraham ben Nathan ha-Yarḥi (c. 1204), it appears that even at that later time the Spanish rite preserved certain European peculiarities that have since been eliminated in order to conform to the rulings of the Geonim and the official texts based on them. (Conversely the surviving versions of those texts, in particular that of Amram Gaon, appear to have been edited to reflect some Spanish and other local usages.) The present Sephardic liturgy should therefore be regarded as the product of gradual convergence between the original local rite and the North African branch of the Babylonian-Arabic family, as prevailing in Geonic times in Egypt and Morocco. Following the Reconquista, the specifically Spanish liturgy was commented on by David Abudirham (c. 1340), who was concerned to ensure conformity with the rulings of halakha, as understood by the authorities up to and including Asher ben Yehiel. Despite this convergence, there were distinctions between the liturgies of different parts of the Iberian peninsula. For example, the Lisbon and Catalan rites were somewhat different from the Castilian rite, which formed the basis of the later Sephardic tradition. The Catalan rite was intermediate between the Castilian rite and that of the Hachmei Provence: Hakham Moses Gaster classified the rites of Oran and Tunis in this group.

===Post-expulsion===
After the expulsion from Spain, the Sephardim took their liturgy with them to countries throughout the Arab and Ottoman Empire, where they soon assumed rabbinic and communal leadership positions. They formed communities, often maintaining differences based on their places of origin in the Iberian peninsula. In Saloniki, for instance, there were more than twenty synagogues, each using the rite of a different locality in Spain or Portugal (as well as one Romaniote and one Ashkenazi synagogue).

In a process lasting from the 16th through the 19th century, the native Jewish communities of most Arab and Ottoman countries adapted their pre-existing liturgies, many of which already had a family resemblance with the Sephardic, to follow the Spanish rite in as many respects as possible. Some reasons for this are:
#The Spanish exiles were regarded as an elite and supplied many of the Chief Rabbis to the countries in which they settled so that the Spanish rite tended to be favoured over any previous native rite;
#The invention of printing meant that Siddurim were printed in bulk, usually in Italy, so that a congregation wanting books generally had to opt for a standard &quot;Sephardi&quot; or &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; text: this led to the obsolescence of many historic local rites, such as the Provençal rite;
#Yosef Karo&#x27;s Shulḥan Arukh presupposes a &quot;Castilian rite&quot; at every point, so that that version of the Spanish rite had the prestige of being &quot;according to the opinion of Maran&quot;;
#The Hakham Bashi of Constantinople was the constitutional head of all the Jews of the Ottoman Empire, further encouraging uniformity. The North Africans in particular were influenced by Greek and Turkish models of Jewish practice and cultural behaviour. For this reason, many of them to this day pray according to a rite known as &quot;minhag Ḥida&quot; (the custom of Chaim Joseph David Azulai).
#The influence of Isaac Luria&#x27;s Kabbalah, see the next section.

===Lurianic Kabbalah===
The most important theological, as opposed to practical, motive for harmonization was the Kabbalistic teachings of Isaac Luria and Ḥayim Vital. Luria himself always maintained that it was the duty of every Jew to abide by his ancestral tradition, so that his prayers should reach the gate in Heaven appropriate to his tribal identity. However he devised a system of usages for his own followers, which were recorded by Vital in his &quot;Sha&#x27;ar ha-Kavvanot&quot; in the form of comments on the Venice edition of the Spanish and Portuguese prayer book. The theory then grew up that this composite Sephardic rite was of special spiritual potency and reached a &quot;thirteenth gate&quot; in Heaven for those who did not know their tribe: prayer in this form could therefore be offered in complete confidence by everyone.

Further Kabbalistic embellishments were recorded in later rabbinic works such as the 18th century &quot;Ḥemdat Yamim&quot; (anonymous, but sometimes attributed to Nathan of Gaza). The most elaborate version of these is contained in the Siddur published by the 18th century Yemenite Kabbalist Shalom Sharabi for the use of the Bet El yeshivah in Jerusalem: this contains only a few lines of text on each page, the rest being filled with intricate meditations on the letter combinations in the prayers. Other scholars commented on the liturgy from both a halachic and a kabbalistic perspective, including Ḥayim Azulai and Ḥayim Palaggi.

The influence of the Lurianic-Sephardic rite extended even to countries outside the Ottoman sphere of influence such as Iran (Persia). (The previous Iranian rite was based on the Siddur of Saadia Gaon.) The main exceptions to this tendency were:
*Yemen, where a conservative group called &quot;Baladi&quot; maintained their ancestral tradition based on the works of Maimonides (and therefore do not regard themselves as Sephardi at all), and
*the Spanish and Portuguese Jews of Western countries, who adopted a certain number of Kabbalistic usages piecemeal in the 17th century but later abandoned many of them because it was felt that the Lurianic Kabbalah had contributed to the Shabbetai Tzevi disaster.
*Some Moroccan communities did not accept certain Kabbalistic practices because they said that they had old traditions that they did not need to change.

There were also Kabbalistic groups in the Ashkenazi world, which adopted the Lurianic-Sephardic ritual, on the theory of the thirteenth gate mentioned above. This accounts for the &quot;Nusach Sefard&quot; and &quot;Nusach Ari&quot; in use among the Hasidim, which is based on the Lurianic-Sephardic text with some Ashkenazi variations.

===19th century===

From the 1840s on, a series of prayer books was published in Livorno, including &quot;Tefillat ha-Ḥodesh&quot;, &quot;Bet Obed&quot; and &quot;Zechor le-Abraham&quot;. These included notes on practice and the Kabbalistic additions to the prayers, but not the meditations of Shalom Sharabi, as the books were designed for public congregational use. They quickly became standard in almost all Sephardic and Oriental communities, with any local variations preserved only by oral tradition. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many more Sephardic prayer books were published in Vienna. These were primarily aimed at the Judaeo-Spanish communities of the Balkans, Greece and Turkey, and therefore had rubrics in Judeo-Spanish, but also had a wider distribution.

A significant influence on Sephardic prayer and custom was the late 19th century Baghdadi rabbi Yosef Hayyim, whose work of that name contained both halachic rulings and observations on Kabbalistic custom based on his correspondence with Eliyahu Mani of the Beit El synagogue. These rulings and observations form the basis of the Baghdadi rite: both the text of the prayers and the accompanying usages differ in some respects from those of the Livorno editions. The rulings of the Ben Ish Ḥai have been accepted in several other Sephardic and Oriental communities, such as that of the Jews of Djerba.

===Present day===
In the Sephardic world today, particularly in Israel, many popular prayer books contain the Baghdadi rite, and this is what is currently known as &quot;Minhag Edot ha-Mizraḥ&quot; (the custom of the Oriental congregations). Other authorities, especially older rabbis from North Africa, reject these in favour of a more conservative Oriental-Sephardic text as found in the 19th century Livorno editions; and the &quot;Shami&quot; Yemenite and Syrian rites belong to this group. Others again, following Ovadia Yosef, prefer a form shorn of some of the Kabbalistic additions and nearer to what would have been known to Joseph Karo, and seek to establish this as the standard &quot;Israeli Sephardi&quot; rite for use by all communities. The liturgy of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews differs from all these (more than the Eastern groups differ from each other), as it represents an older form of the text, has far fewer Kabbalistic additions and reflects some Italian influence. The differences between all these groups, however, exist at the level of detailed wording, for example the insertion or omission of a few extra passages: structurally, all Sephardic rites are very similar.

==Instances of Sephardic usage==

=== Tefillin ===
*Most Sephardi groups do not put on tefillin during Chol HaMoed, the middle days of festivals. L
*They say only one blessing to cover the tefillin of the arm and the head, rather than one for each. However, they say the second blessing if interrupted and have to say something after placing the arm tefillin.
*Sephardim wind the tefillin strap anti-clockwise (for a right-handed person). The form of the knot and the wrappings round the hand are also different from that of the Ashkenazim.
*The letter shin on the head tefillin has a different calligraphy than on the Ashkenazi tefillin.
*The script used in Torah scrolls, tefillin and mezuzot differs from the Ashkenazi and nearer to the printed square characters. This script is called &quot;Velsh&quot; or &quot;Veilish&quot; (the Yiddish equivalent of German Wälsch) and comes from Italy. The &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; uses the traditional Ashkenazi script instead. A third script, associated with Isaac Luria, is used by Hasidim.
=== Tzitzit ===
*It&#x27;s not a Sephardi practice to let the tzitziyot of the tzitzit katan hang out.
*In the tzitzit, each winding loops through the preceding one, and the pattern of windings between the knots is either 10-5-6-5 (in some communities, L) or 7-8-11-13 (in others, per &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;).
=== Mezuzah ===
*Mezuzot are placed vertically rather than slanting, except among Spanish and Portuguese Jews in western countries.
=== Liturgy ===
*In many of the prayers, Sephardim preserve Mishnaic Hebrew vocalization and have mostly not altered them to conform with the rules of Biblical Hebrew: examples are &quot;Naqdishakh&quot; (not &quot;Naqdishkha&quot;) and &quot;ha-Gefen&quot; (not &quot;ha-Gafen&quot;).
*Sephardim read/chant most of the prayers end to end out loud, unlike the Ashkenazi practice that the Hazan reads the first line out loud, followed by silent reading, and finishing up by reading the last few lines out loud before moving to the next prayer.
*Sephardim start Mincha with Patach Eliyahu, Leshem Yihud, Ma Yedidot,L Korban HaTamid, and Parashat HaKtoret before Ashrei. While Patach Eliyahu is sometimes omitted, the other prayers are standard practice by most Sephardim.
*Friday evening, most Sephardi groups (but not the Spanish and Portuguese) sing the Shir hashirim between Minha and Kabbalat Shabbat. L
*The order of the prayers in the pesukei dezimra differs from the Ashkenazi practice and includes some additional prayers.
*Close to the end of the zemirot, the Sephardi Hazan doesn&#x27;t sing Shoken ad. Instead, Shavat aniyim is sung. It has many melodies that vary by the weekly maqam in the Eastern communities.
*Before the Amida, they don&#x27;t say &quot;Tzur Yisrael.&quot;
*The second blessing before the Shema begins &quot;Ahavat ʿOlam&quot; (and not &quot;Ahavah Rabbah&quot;) in all services.
*Many Sephardim don&#x27;t take three steps back and three steps forward before the Amidah nor bend their knees.
*In the summer months they use the words &quot;Morid ha-Ṭal&quot; in the second blessing of the Amida. P
*The &quot;Qedushah&quot; of the morning service begins &quot;Naqdishakh ve-Naʿariṣakh&quot;, and the &quot;Qedushah&quot; of musaf (the additional service for Shabbat and festivals) begins &quot;Keter Yitenu L&#x27;kha&quot;.
*There are separate summer and winter forms for the &quot;Birkat ha-Shanim&quot;.
*There is no Priestly Blessing in minḥa (the afternoon service) on any day. P
*In most communities, Kohanim say the Priestly Blessing daily during Shaharit and Musaf, even outside of Israel, unlike the Ashkenazi practice of saying it only on the major Festivals. However, in Spanish and Portuguese communities, it is recited only on festivals like Ashkenazim, and in some communities, it is done on Shabbat but not during the week.
*The last blessing of the Amida is &quot;Sim Shalom&quot; (and not &quot;Shalom Rav&quot;) in all services.
* In most communities (except for Spanish and Portuguese) since the times of the Ari, the short Tahanun includes the Vidui, the Thirteen Attributes, and Psalm 25, among others.L The order of the long Tahanun varies based on the particular rite and includes three additional Thirteen Attributes. Most communities stand for the beginning of Tahanun (including the Vidui, the Thirteen Attributes) and sit erect (without resting their head on their arm) for Psalm 25, but customs vary between communities. 
*When removing the Torah from the Ark on Shabbat, most Sephardic communities recite &quot;Ata horeta ladaat.&quot;
*Some of the haftara readings are different than the Ashkenazi practice.
*Close to the end of the Musaf service, Sephardim read Kol Yisrael before Ein Keloheinu.
*The Hazan calls Barechu before the ʿAleinu.
*After Aleinu, some Sephardim say Uvtorateha Hashem Elokeinu katuv leimor Shemaʿ ...
*Most Sephardim sit for Kaddish unless they were standing previously.
*The Kaddish is longer and the congregation responds &quot;amen&quot; after &quot;berikh hu.&quot;
*Adon Olam has an extra stanza, and is longer still in Oriental communities.
*Shalom aleichem has an extra stanza.
*The verses recited at the beginning of Havdala differ from the Ashkenazi practice.
*The blessing before Hallel concludes with לגמור את ההלל, rather than לקרא את ההלל.

=== Torah scroll ===
*In many communities (mostly Mizrahi rather than Sephardi proper) the Torah scroll is kept in a &quot;tiq&quot; (wooden or metal case) instead of a velvet mantle.
*They lift the Torah scroll and display it to the congregation before the Torah reading rather than after. B

=== Synagogue ===
*Typically, the Torah reading platform, which Sephardim generally call Teva/Teba, is traditionally not in the front of the sanctuary but in the center or back of it.
*In Middle Eastern communities, the Torah is read on a horizontal box also called the Teva/Teba rather than a slanted table as the Ashkenazi or Western Sephardic tradition.
*The ark where the Torah scrolls are stored is called Hekhal (also Hekhal kodesh in the Greek and Turkish communities), rather than Aron kodesh.

=== Torah service ===
*The blessing after the ʿAliya may include Torato before Torat emet.
*After an ʿAliya, the ʿoleh is congratulated by other congregants with Hazak uvaruch rather than Yasher koach and the ole responds with Hazak ve&#x27;ematz.
*Most Sephardim remain seated when the 10 Commandments are being read. However Western Sephardim (UK and the Netherlands) stand, similar to Ashkenazim.

=== Kashrut ===
* Sephardim distinguish rice from kitniyyot.
** While Mizrachi Jews generally eat rice on Passover, many Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, Turkish, and North African Sephardim do not.
** Most Sephardim regard it as permissible to eat fresh Kitniyot (legumes and seeds such as green beans and fresh peas or maize) on Passover.
** The custom of eating dried legumes on Passover varies between communities, it is independent of the custom of eating rice.
** Some Greek and Turkish Sephardim have the custom to also avoid potatoes on Passover.
* Many Sephardim avoid eating fish with milk, as in Eastern Mediterranean countries this is widely considered to be unhealthy (by non-Jews as well as Jews). Ashkenazim and Western Sephardim argue that this practice originated from a mistake in the Bet Yosef, and that the prohibition really concerned the eating of fish with meat.
* The laws of sheḥitah are in some respects stricter and in other respects less strict than those of Ashkenazim (modern kashrut authorities try to ensure that all meat complies with both standards).
* The Sephardi definition of bread is significantly stricter than the Ashkenazi one. Many challot consumed by Ashkenazim on Shabbat contain too much egg, sugar, raisin, even chocolate to Sephardi standards and are considered cake (uga, עוגה) rather than bread (lechem, לחם). Therefore the hamotzi lechem (המוציא לחם) blessing cannot be said over it and in turn the kiddush is not valid. Ashkenazi hosts are encouraged to be sensitive to this difference when having Sephardi guests over.

=== Holidays ===

*Seliḥot are said throughout Elul in the morning rather than at night.
*Around Rosh Hashanah, the typical new year greeting is &quot;Tizku leshanim rabot&quot; (תזכו לשנים רבות). The answer is &quot;Neʿimot vetovot&quot; (נעימות וטובות).
*Sephardic Rishonim (medieval scholars) reject the customs of Tashlikh and Kapparot, though they were re-introduced by the Lurianic Kabbalah. Spanish and Portuguese Jews still do not observe them.

*Only one set of Hanukkah lights is lit in each household.
*The &quot;shammash&quot; is generally lit after the other Hanukkah lights and after singing &quot;Hannerot hallalu&quot;, instead of being used to light them (which would be impractical, given that the lights are traditionally oil lamps rather than candles).

*Sephardim only say blessings over the first and third cups of Passover wine, instead of over all four.
*The items on the Seder plate are arranged in a fixed hexagonal order (except among Spanish and Portuguese Jews: this usage is increasingly popular among Ashkenazim). L
*During the Counting of the ʿOmer period, observant Sephardi men avoid cutting their hair and shaving/cutting their beard for 34 days, rather than 33, as the Ashkenazi practice.
=== Life cycle ===
==== Birth and naming ====
* The naming ceremony of a girl is called &quot;Zebed habbat&quot;/&quot;Zeved habbat&quot; in Hebrew and &quot;las Fadas&quot; in Spanish and Judeospanyol. In some communities (e.g., Hamburg) it happens on the 30th day after birth. The core elements are Shir hashirim 2:14 (and for a first-born girl, 6:9) and a &quot;Mi shebberakh&quot; referring to the matriarchs for the naming of the girl. Each community has various additional elements to the ceremony.
==== Marriage ====
* The bride does not traditionally circle the groom.
==== Bereavement ====
*The Sephardi term of commemorating a close relative&#x27;s death is nahala (נחלה) or meldado. Ashkenazim use the Yiddish term Yahrzeit instead. 
*The common Sephardi greeting to express a condolence is Min hashamayim tenuhamu (מן השמים תנוחמו).
*If a relative passed away in the month of Adar, in a leap year, most Sephardim commemorate it in Adar II rather than the Ashkenazi practice of Adar I or both.
*The Sephardi memorial prayers (Hashkabot) serve a similar role to the Ashkenazi Yizkor.
=== Given names ===
*Sephardim often name their children after living grandparents, which is a great respect. On the other hand, Ashkenazim never name their children after a living person.

<doc id="231350" wikidata="Q1129382" url="?curid=231350" title="Low-noise block downconverter">
<text>A low-noise block downconverter (LNB) is the receiving device mounted on satellite dishes used for satellite TV reception, which collects the radio waves from the dish and converts them to a signal which is sent through a cable to the receiver inside the building. Also called a low-noise block, low-noise converter (LNC), or even low-noise downconverter (LND), the device is sometimes inaccurately called a &quot;low-noise amplifier&quot; (&quot;LNA&quot;).

The LNB is a combination of low-noise amplifier, frequency mixer, local oscillator and intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier. It serves as the RF front end of the satellite receiver, receiving the microwave signal from the satellite collected by the dish, amplifying it, and downconverting the block of frequencies to a lower block of intermediate frequencies (IF). This downconversion allows the signal to be carried to the indoor satellite TV receiver using relatively cheap coaxial cable; if the signal remained at its original microwave frequency it would require an expensive and impractical waveguide line.

The LNB is usually a small box suspended on one or more short booms, or feed arms, in front of the dish reflector, at its focus (although some dish designs have the LNB on or behind the reflector). The microwave signal from the dish is picked up by a feedhorn on the LNB and is fed to a section of waveguide. One or more metal pins, or probes, protrude into the waveguide at right angles to the axis and act as antennas, feeding the signal to a printed circuit board inside the LNB&#x27;s shielded box for processing. The lower frequency IF output signal emerges from a socket on the box to which the coaxial cable connects.


The LNB gets its power from the receiver or set-top box, using the same coaxial cable that carries signals from the LNB to the receiver. This &quot;phantom power&quot; travels to the LNB; opposite to the signals from the LNB.

A corresponding component, called a block upconverter (BUC), is used at the satellite earth station (uplink) dish to convert the band of television channels to the microwave uplink frequency.

==Amplification and noise==
The signal received by the LNB is extremely weak and it has to be amplified before downconversion. The low-noise amplifier section of the LNB amplifies this weak signal while adding the minimum possible amount of noise to the signal.

The low-noise quality of an LNB is expressed as the noise figure (or sometimes noise temperature). This is the signal-to-noise ratio at the input divided by the signal-to-noise ratio at the output. It is typically expressed as a decibels (dB) value. The ideal LNB, effectively a perfect amplifier, would have a noise figure of 0 dB and would not add any noise to the signal. Every LNB introduces some noise but clever design techniques, expensive high-performance low-noise components such as HEMTs and even individual tweaking of the LNB after manufacture, can reduce some of the noise contributed by the LNB&#x27;s components. Active cooling to very low temperatures can help reduce noise too, and is often used in scientific research applications.

Every LNB off the production line has a different noise figure because of manufacturing tolerances. The noise figure quoted in the specifications, important for determining the LNB&#x27;s suitability, is usually representative of neither that particular LNB nor the performance across the whole frequency range, since the noise figure most often quoted is the &quot;typical&quot; figure averaged over the production batch.
==Block downconversion==
Satellites use comparatively high radio frequencies (microwaves) to transmit their TV signals. As microwave satellite signals do not easily pass through walls, roofs, or even glass windows, it is preferable for satellite antennas to be mounted outdoors. However, plastic glazing is transparent to microwaves and residential satellite dishes have successfully been hidden indoors looking through acrylic or polycarbonate windows to preserve the external aesthetics of the home.

The purpose of the LNB is to use heterodyning to take a block (or band) of relatively high frequencies and convert them to similar signals carried at a much lower frequency (called the intermediate frequency or IF). These lower frequencies travel through cables with much less attenuation, so there is much more signal left at the satellite receiver end of the cable. It is also much easier and cheaper to design electronic circuits to operate at these lower frequencies, rather than the very high frequencies of satellite transmission.

The frequency conversion is performed by mixing a fixed frequency produced by a local oscillator inside the LNB with the incoming signal, to generate two signals equal to the sum of their frequencies and the difference. The frequency sum signal is filtered out and the frequency difference signal (the IF) is amplified and sent down the cable to the receiver:

;C-band: formula_1
;Ku-band: formula_2

where formula_3 is a frequency.

The local oscillator frequency determines what block of incoming frequencies is downconverted to the frequencies expected by the receiver. For example, to downconvert the incoming signals from Astra 1KR, which transmits in a frequency block of 10.70–11.70 GHz, to within a standard European receiver&#x27;s IF tuning range of 950–2,150 MHz, a 9.75 GHz local oscillator frequency is used, producing a block of signals in the band 950–1,950 MHz.

For the block of higher transmission frequencies used by Astra 2A and 2B (11.70–12.75 GHz), a different local oscillator frequency converts the block of incoming frequencies. Typically, a local oscillator frequency of 10.60 GHz is used to downconvert the block to 1,100–2,150 MHz, which is still within the receiver&#x27;s 950–2,150 MHz IF tuning range.

In a C-band antenna setup, the transmission frequencies are typically 3.7–4.2 GHz. By using a local oscillator frequency of 5.150 GHz the IF will be 950–1,450 MHz which is, again, in the receiver&#x27;s IF tuning range.

For the reception of wideband satellite television carriers, typically 27 MHz wide, the accuracy of the frequency of the LNB local oscillator need only be in the order of ±500 kHz, so low cost dielectric oscillators (DRO) may be used. For the reception of narrow bandwidth carriers or ones using advanced modulation techniques, such as 16-QAM, highly stable and low phase noise LNB local oscillators are required. These use an internal crystal oscillator or an external 10 MHz reference from the indoor unit and a phase-locked loop (PLL) oscillator.

==Low-noise block feedhorns (LNBFs) ==

With the launch of the first DTH broadcast satellite in Europe (Astra 1A) by SES in 1988, antenna design was simplified for the anticipated mass market. In particular, the feedhorn (which gathers the signal and directs it to the LNB) and the polarizer (which selects between differently polarized signals) were combined with the LNB itself into a single unit, called an LNB-feed or LNB-feedhorn (LNBF), or even an &quot;Astra type&quot; LNB. The prevalence of these combined units has meant that today the term LNB is commonly used to refer to all antenna units that provide the block-downconversion function, with or without a feedhorn.
The Astra type LNBF that includes a feedhorn and polarizer is the most common variety, and this is fitted to a dish using a bracket that clamps a collar around the waveguide neck of the LNB between the feedhorn and the electronics package. The diameter of the LNB neck and collar is usually 40mm although other sizes are also produced. In the UK, the &quot;minidish&quot; sold for use with Sky Digital and Freesat uses an LNBF with an integrated clip-in mount.

LNBs without a feedhorn built-in are usually provided with a (C120) flange around the input waveguide mouth which is bolted to a matching flange around the output of the feedhorn or polarizer unit.

==Polarization==

It is common to polarize satellite TV signals because it provides a way of transmitting more TV channels using a given block of frequencies. This approach requires the use of receiving equipment that can filter incoming signals based on their polarization. Two satellite TV signals can then be transmitted on the same frequency (or, more usually, closely spaced frequencies) and provided that they are polarized differently, the receiving equipment can still separate them and display whichever one is currently required.

Throughout the world, most satellite TV transmissions use vertical and horizontal linear polarization, but in North America, DBS transmissions use left- and right-hand circular polarization. Within the waveguide of a North American DBS LNB a slab of dielectric material is used to convert left and right circular polarized signals to vertical and horizontal linearly polarized signals so the converted signals can be treated the same as in systems that use linear polarization for transmission.
The probe inside the LNB waveguide collects signals that are polarized in the same plane as the probe. To maximise the strength of the wanted signals (and to minimise reception of unwanted signals of the opposite polarization), the probe is aligned with the polarization of the incoming signals. This is most simply achieved by adjusting the LNB&#x27;s &quot;skew&quot;; its rotation about the waveguide axis. To remotely select between the two polarizations, and to compensate for inaccuracies of the skew angle, it used to be common to fit a &quot;polarizer&quot; in front of the LNB&#x27;s waveguide mouth. This either rotates the incoming signal with an electromagnet around the waveguide (a magnetic polarizer) or rotates an intermediate probe within the waveguide using a servo motor (a mechanical polarizer) but such adjustable skew polarizers are rarely used today.

The simplification of antenna design that accompanied the first Astra DTH broadcast satellites in Europe to produce the LNBF extended to a simpler approach to the selection between vertical and horizontal polarized signals too. Astra type LNBFs incorporate two probes in the waveguide, at right angles to one another so that, once the LNB has been skewed in its mount to match the local polarization angle, one probe collects horizontal signals and the other vertical, and an electronic switch (controlled by the voltage of the LNB&#x27;s power supply from the receiver: 13 V for vertical and 18 V for horizontal) determines which polarization is passed on through the LNB for amplification and block-downconversion.

Such LNBs can receive all the transmissions from a satellite with no moving parts and with just one cable connected to the receiver, and have since become the most common type of LNB produced.

== Common LNBs ==

=== C-band LNB ===
Here is an example of a North American C-band LNB:
* Local oscillator: 5.15 GHz
* Frequency: 3.40–4.20 GHz
* Noise temperature: 25–100 kelvins (uses kelvin ratings as opposed to dB rating).
* Polarization: Linear

=== K-band LNB ===
==== Standard North America Ku band LNB ====
Here is an example of a standard linear LNB:
* Local oscillator: 10.75 GHz
* Frequency: 11.70–12.20 GHz
* Noise figure: 1 dB typical
* Polarization: Linear

==== Universal LNB (&quot;Astra&quot; LNB) ====
In Europe, as SES launched more Astra satellites to the 19.2°E orbital position in the 1990s, the range of downlink frequencies used in the FSS band (10.70–11.70 GHz) grew beyond that catered for by the standard LNBs and receivers of the time. Reception of signals from Astra 1D required an extension of receivers&#x27; IF tuning range from 950–1,950 MHz to 950–2,150 MHz and a change of LNBs&#x27; local oscillator frequency from the usual 10 GHz to 9.75 GHz (so-called &quot;enhanced&quot; LNBs).

The launch of Astra 1E and subsequent satellites saw the first use by Astra of the BSS band of frequencies (11.70–12.75 GHz) for new digital services and required the introduction of an LNB that would receive the whole frequency range 10.70–12.75 GHz, the &quot;universal&quot; LNB.

A universal LNB has a switchable local oscillator frequency of 9.75/10.60 GHz to provide two modes of operation: low band reception (10.70–11.70 GHz) and high band reception (11.70–12.75 GHz). The local oscillator frequency is switched in response to a 22 kHz signal superimposed on the supply voltage from the connected receiver. Along with the supply voltage level used to switch between polarizations, this enables a universal LNB to receive both polarizations (vertical and horizontal) and the full range of frequencies in the satellite under the control of the receiver, in four sub-bands:

Here is an example of a universal LNB used in Europe:
* Noise figure: 0.2 dB typical
* Polarization: Linear

==== North America DBS LNB ====

Here is an example of an LNB used for DBS:
* Local oscillator: 11.25 GHz
* Frequency: 12.20–12.70 GHz
* Noise figure: 0.7 dB
* Polarization: Circular

=== K band LNB ===
Here are examples of K band LNBs:

Here is an example of a Norsat K band LNB:

=== S band LNB ===
Here is an example of an S band LNB:
* Local oscillator: 1.57 GHz
* Frequency: 2.52-2.67 GHz
* Noise temperature: Maximum of 50 kelvins (uses kelvin ratings as opposed to dB rating)
* Polarization: Linear

This frequency range of LNB is quite rare as the only direct broadcast satellites that work with the S-band frequency are IndoStar-1 and IndoStar-2, both utilized by Indonesian direct-to-home provider MNC Vision. S-band was chosen for these satellites because its frequencies efficiently penetrate the atmosphere and provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80 cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. A similar Ku- or C-band reception performance requires greater transmission power or much larger dish to penetrate the moist atmosphere.

==Multi-output LNBs==

=== Dual, twin, quad, and octo LNBs ===

An LNB with a single feedhorn but multiple outputs for connection to multiple tuners (in separate receivers or within the same receiver in the case of a twin-tuner PVR receiver). Typically, two, four or eight outputs are provided. Each output responds to the tuner&#x27;s band and polarization selection signals independently of the other outputs and appears to the tuner to be a separate LNB. Such an LNB usually may derive its power from a receiver connected to any of the outputs. Unused outputs may be left unconnected (but waterproofed for the protection of the whole LNB).

Note: In the US an LNB with two outputs is termed a &quot;dual LNB&quot;, but in the UK the term &quot;dual LNB&quot; historically described an LNB with two outputs, each producing only one polarisation, for connection to a multiswitch (the term and the LNBs fell out of use with the introduction of the universal LNB and the multiswitch equivalent, the quattro LNB – see below). Today &quot;dual LNB&quot; (and &quot;dual feed&quot;) describes antennas for reception from two satellite positions, using either two separate LNBs or a single monoblock LNB with two feedhorns. In the UK, the term &quot;twin-output LNB&quot;, or simply &quot;twin LNB&quot;, is usually used for an LNB with a single feedhorn but two independent outputs.

=== Quattro LNBs ===
A special type of LNB (not to be confused with Quad LNB) intended for use in a shared dish installation to deliver signals to any number of tuners. A quattro LNB has a single feedhorn and four outputs, which each supply just one of the Ku sub-bands (low band/horizontal polarization, high band/vertical polarization, low/vertical and high/horizontal) to a multiswitch or an array of multiswitches, which then delivers to each connected tuner whichever sub-band is required by that tuner.

Although a quattro LNB typically looks similar to a quad LNB, it cannot (sensibly) be connected to receivers directly. Note again the difference between a quad and a quattro LNB: A quad LNB can drive four tuners directly, with each output providing signals from the entire Ku band. A quattro LNB is for connection to a multiswitch in a shared dish distribution system and each output provides only a quarter of the Ku band signals.

===Satellite channel router (SCR), or unicable LNBs===
Multiple tuners may also be fed from a satellite channel router (SCR) or unicable LNB in a single cable distribution system. A Unicable LNB has one output connector but operates in a different way to standard LNBs so it can feed multiple tuners daisy-chained along a single coax cable.

Instead of block-downconverting the whole received spectrum, an SCR LNB downconverts a small section of the received signal (equivalent to the bandwidth of a single transponder on the satellite) selected according to a DiSEqC-compliant command from the receiver, to output at a fixed frequency in the IF. Up to 32 tuners can be allocated a different frequency in the IF range and for each, the SCR LNB downconverts the corresponding individually requested transponder.

Most SCR LNBs also include either a legacy mode of operation or a separate legacy output which provides the received spectrum block-downconverted to the whole IF range in the conventional way.

===Wideband LNB===
ASTRA Universal Wideband LNBs with an oscillator frequency of 10.40 or 10.41 GHz are entering the market. The intermediate frequency band is much wider than in a conventional LNB, as the high and low band are not split up.

Wideband LNB signals can be accepted by new wideband tuners, and by new SCR systems (e.g., Inverto/Fuba, Unitron, Optel, GT-Sat/Astro), with or without optical transmission. Wideband signals can be converted to conventional quattro signals and vice versa.

In February 2016, Sky (UK) launched a new LNB only compatible with their new wideband tuner. This LNB has one port for all vertical polarised channels both low and high band, and another port for all low and high band horizontal channels. The basic model has only 2 connections and presumably has a local oscillator of 10.41 GHz with an intermediate frequency of 290–2340 MHz from an input of 10.7–12.75 GHz. This LNB seems to be the same as Unitron&#x27;s ASTRA Universal Wideband LNB. Two cables minimum are needed to access all channels. In the Sky Q box, multiple tuners can select multiple channels, more than the usual two for dual coax systems. This type of LNB is incompatible with the more common Astra Universal LNB used in the UK meaning the LNB is changed during upgrade. There is a model of the LNB with 6 connections, 2 for Sky Q and 4 Astra Universal LNB for users with multiple legacy systems such as Freesat in addition to Sky Q. In cases where only a single cable is possible, such as apartment blocks, Sky Q compatible multiswitches can be used, which instead use BSkyB SCR.

==Optical-fibre LNBs==
LNBs for fibre satellite distribution systems operate in a similar way to conventional electrical LNBs, except that all four of the sub-bands in the entire K band spectrum of 10.70–12.75 GHz across two signal polarisations are simultaneously block-downconverted (as in a quattro LNB). The four sub-bands’ IFs are stacked to create one IF with a range of 0.95–5.45 GHz (a bandwidth of 4.5 GHz), which is modulated on an optical signal using a semiconductor laser, to send down the fibre cable.

At the receiver, the optical signal is converted back to the traditional electrical signal to &quot;appear&quot; to the receiver as a conventional LNB.

== Monoblock LNBs ==
A monoblock (or monobloc) LNB is a single unit comprising two, three or four LNBs and a DiSEqC switch, designed to receive signals from two, three or four satellites spaced close together and to feed the selected signal to the receiver. The feedhorns of the two LNBs are at a fixed distance apart for reception of satellites of a particular orbital separation (often 6°, but also 4°). Although the same functionality can be achieved with separate LNBs and a switch, a monoblock LNB, constructed in one unit, is more convenient to install and enables the two feedhorns to be closer together than individually cased LNBs (typically 60mm diameter). The distance between the feedhorns depends on the orbital separation of the satellites to be received, the diameter and focal length of the dish used, and the position of the reception site relative to the satellites. So monoblock LNBs are usually a compromise solution designed to operate with standard dishes in a particular region. For example, in parts of Europe, monoblocks designed to receive the Hot Bird and Astra 19.2°E satellites are popular because they enable reception of both satellites on a single dish without requiring an expensive, slow and noisy motorised dish. A similar advantage is provided by the duo LNB for simultaneous reception of signals from both the Astra 23.5°E and Astra 19.2°E positions.

There are also available triple monoblock LNB units, which enable users to receive three satellites:

for example Hotbird 13°E, Eutelsat 16°E and Astra 19.2°E
or the same can be used for positions: Eutelsat 7°E, Eutelsat 10°E and Hotbird 13°E. This monoblock can be used for other positions with the same spacing (3°+3°=6°spacing).

Other very popular example for different spacing is: Astra 1: 19.2°E, Astra 3: 23.5°E and Astra 2: 28.2°E (4.3°+4.7°=9°spacing).

And there are also available four feed monoblock LNB units, which enable users to receive signals from four satellites, for example Eurobird 9°E, Hotbird 13°E, Astra 19.2°E and Astra 23.5°E (4°+6.2°+4.3°=14.5°spacing).

Most receivers sold nowadays are compatible with at least DiSeqC 1.0 which allows to switch automatically between 4 satellites (all of contemporary Monoblock LNBs), as user changes channel on remote control.

== Cold temperatures ==
It is possible for moisture in an LNB to freeze, causing ice to build-up at very low temperatures. This is only likely to occur when the LNB is not receiving power from the satellite receiver (i.e., no programmes are being watched). To combat this, many satellite receivers provide an option to keep the LNB powered while the receiver is on standby. In fact, most LNBs are kept powered because this helps to stabilise the temperature and, thereby, the local oscillator frequency by the dissipated heat from the circuitry of LNB. In the case of UK BSkyB receivers, the LNB remains powered while in standby so that the receiver can receive firmware updates and Electronic Programme Guide updates. In the United States, the LNB connected to a Dish Network receiver remains powered so the system can receive software and firmware updates and guide information over the air at night. In Turkey, another LNB type Digiturk MDUs are kept powered to receive VOD content, STB firmware, EPG data, and pay-TV keys in order to watch encrypted content.

<doc id="231352" wikidata="Q15395690" url="?curid=231352" title="Citrus cavaleriei">
<text>Citrus cavaleriei, the Ichang papeda (Chinese: ), is a slow-growing species of papeda that has characteristic lemon-scented foliage and flowers.

It is native to southwestern and west-central China and is likely named for the city of Yichang (宜昌), in China&#x27;s Hubei province.

The Ichang papeda is notable for its unusual hardiness. With the exception of &quot;Poncirus trifoliata&quot;, it is the hardiest citrus plant, tolerating both moderate frost and damp conditions.

==Description==
Relatively rare in cultivation, the Ichang papeda is a large shrub or small tree, growing to , and produces a small, mandarin-like fruit. Leaves feature a broad petiole, and resemble the leaves of the yuzu and the kaffir lime in appearance. The fruit has a fragrant, but rugged rind, and may be oval, spherical, or flattened in shape, ripening to yellow or orange. It contains many large monoembryonic seeds and a small quantity of bitter or sour juice; some fruits lack juice entirely and are instead filled with a mass of pith and seeds.

The Ichang papeda is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant.

==Hybrids==
The Ichang papeda has been hybridised with many other citrus varieties, notably to produce hybrids that are relatively cold-hardy. Many of these hybrids also have many culinary applications:
* Kabosu - An Ichang papeda x Bitter orange cross.
* Shangjuan (also known as the Ichang lemon) - A cross between an Ichang papeda and a Pomelo.
* Yuzu - A naturally occurring hybrid between an Ichang papeda and a Mandarin orange.
** Hyuganatsu - A Yuzu x Pomelo cross.
*** Haruka - A Hyuganatsu x Natsudaidai cross.
** Jabara - Yuzu x Mandarin orange cross.
** Sudachi - A cross between a Yuzu and a Koji/Tachibana orange.

<text>The Hospitallers of St Thomas of Canterbury at Acre, usually called the Knights of [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas]], was a Christian military order of the Catholic Church. Membership was restricted to Englishmen.

The emblem of the order was a red cross with a white scallop in the centre and the Knights wore a white habit.

==History==
===Foundation===
It was established in 1191, at Acre, after the capture of that city by Richard I of England and Philip II of France. After the capture of the city, William, Chaplain to the Dean of St. Pauls Cathedral at London, formed a small religious order, its members taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. The purpose of the Order was tending to the sick and wounded, and burying the Christian knights who fell in battle in the Holy Land. To that, William, as Prior of the Order, added the purpose of raising funds to ransom captives from the Muslim armies of Saladin. The success of the Order enabled it to establish a church and hospital which was dedicated to St Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. Becket had been murdered in 1170. He was declared a martyr and canonised in 1173.

===Property of the Hospital of St Thomas===
Like other religious orders, the Hospital of St Thomas acquired a range of properties including St Thomas&#x27;s Mill, a watermill in the Bow Back Rivers area, Stratford. Previously known as Fote&#x27;s Mill, around 1245 the Hospital was recorded as paying an annual rent of 9s. 6d for the use of this mill.

===Militarisation===
It was militarised by Peter of Roche, Bishop of Winchester, during the Sixth Crusade 1227–1229. According to Pope Gregory IX this was done thanks to the indulgence of the existing canons of the Hospital of St Thomas in Acre. Peter contributed to the defences of Jaffa and Sidon. In 1236, Pope Gregory IX granted Papal confirmation to the Order, which became known as the Knights of St Thomas Acon (Acre being Anglicised to Acon). It adopted the rule of the Teutonic Knights. 

For the next 100 years, the crusaders held and defended the city of Acre. During this period, about the year 1279, as the purposes of the Knights of St Thomas shifted from that of religious hospitallers to a more military role, the position of Prior, the Order&#x27;s religious head, lost its pre-eminent position to the Masters of the Order who acquired property and privileges, and created a provincial organisation in the British Isles, with its headquarters in Cheapside London and a subordinate preceptory in Kilkenny. In 1257 Alexander IV noted that the foundation did not have adequate resources. By 1279 it appealed to Edward I for funds, and their financial problems seem to have prompted the proposal to merge with the Knights Templar. However, there was opposition to this from the knights both in the Levant and England. In 1316 members successfully appealed to Edward I against a Templar takeover and also opposed an attempt takeover by the convent of Bonhommes at Ashridge

At the fall of Acre, 12 May 1291, the Master and nine knights of the Order were killed. Following the battle, the Holy Land was lost to the Saracens, the Order of St Thomas, along with the Order of Knights Templar, moved their Priory to the island of Cyprus where they erected the beautiful St. Nicholas Church at Nicosia. (The ruins of the Church are still standing and have been recently restored.) However divisions arose between the master in Cyprus and the master of the London headquarters. By 1320, with a deteriorating situation in the Levant, Henry of Bedford, the master in Cyprus, came to London and ousted the incumbent master there. When he then appointed a deputy to handle the situation in Cyprus, the brothers there resisted this move. Although this resistance was overcome, within a few years control of the organisation had once more reverted to Nicosia. However the financial situation continued to deteriorate with reports of the London premises being reported as being in ruins by 1330 and the order ceased to be a viable military organisation with nothing more being heard of the master in Nicosia after 1360.

===The end and dissolution===
Having abandoned a military role, they also abandoned the rule of the Teutonic Knights, adopting that of the Augustinians and carrying out charitable work and running a grammar school. Links developed with the Mercers livery company at this time – Becket&#x27;s father, Gilbert had been a mercer. The latter became their patrons, holding meetings there and using the chapel for prayers. The Order was dissolved in 1538, along with other monastic orders in England, by Henry VIII.

===The Worshipful Mercers&#x27; Company of London===
After the dissolution of the Order, the King offered the hospital and chapel for sale. It was purchased by the Mercers. But the buildings were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The Mercers Company is the premier livery company of London, ranking first in the order of precedence of the &quot;Great Twelve City Livery Companies&quot;.

The second hall, opened in 1676, was destroyed in 1941 during the Blitz. The present-day Mercer&#x27;s Hall and Chapel, opened in 1958, are built on the site. It incorporates some of the fixtures, 17th-century woodwork and Victorian stained glass from the second hall. All that remains of the original Chapel is the recumbent statue of Christ which lies at the entrance to the Mercer&#x27;s Chapel. The Worshipful Company of Mercers is one of the few London Livery Companies to have its own private chapel.

<text>Joel Teitelbaum (, ; 13 January 1887 – 19 August 1979) was the founder and first Grand Rebbe of the Satmar dynasty. The Satmar Rebbe is also known as the Krula Rav.

A major figure in the post-war renaissance of Hasidism, he espoused a strictly conservative and isolationist line, rejecting modernity. Teitelbaum was a fierce opponent of Zionism, which he decried as inherently heretical.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Teitelbaum was born on January 13, 1887. He was the second son of the Grand Rabbi of Sighet Chananyah Yom Tov Lipa Teitelbaum and his second wife, Chana Ashkenazi. The couple married in 1878, after receiving a special dispensation for him to take a second wife, as his first wife Reitze—daughter of Rebbe Menashe Rubin of Ropshitz—was unable to bear children. Joel was the youngest child; he had four older siblings.

The rabbis of the Teitelbaum family were known for their highly conservative stances and their opposition to the Enlightenment, Neolog Judaism, and Zionism. Chananyah was the great-grandson of Moshe Teitelbaum, a disciple of the Seer of Lublin, who was, in turn, one of the main promulgators of Hasidism in Hungary. He served as a rabbi in Técső. In 1883, after his father&#x27;s death, Chananyah arrived in Máramarossziget (shortened to Siget in Yiddish; today Sighet, Romania), where he began to serve as a rabbi. He became dean of the local rabbinical seminary and the leader of the eponymous Hasidic movement based in the city.

Joel was renowned for his intellectual capacities from a young age. At his bar mitzvah, he delivered a sermon of several hours concerning an issue from tractate &quot;Shabbat&quot; in the Talmud. He was stringent in matters regarding ritual purity and would lengthily prepare for prayer by meticulously cleaning himself.

Even before marrying, he received &quot;semikhah&quot; from eight prominent rabbis, including Moshe Greenwald. In 1904, just several days before his father&#x27;s February 15 death, the 17-year-old married Chavah Horowitz, the daughter of Abraham Chaim Horowitz of Połaniec. They had three daughters, none of whom survived their father or had any children. The first, Esther, died in her youth on September 14, 1921; Rachel died on March 19, 1931, shortly after her wedding. The youngest, Chaya Roisa (or Reysel), died on October 23, 1953.

Teitelbaum&#x27;s older brother, Chaim Tzvi Teitelbaum, succeeded their father in all three of his posts. Their mother and a small faction of the Hasidim regarded the younger brother (i.e. Joel) as the appropriate heir. The newly-wedded Joel and Chava then moved to her father&#x27;s residence in Radomyśl Wielki and remained there for over a year.

On 8 September 1905, the Teitelbaums settled in Szatmárnémeti, or Satmar in Yiddish. Despite his youth, supporters opened a study hall for him. He gradually began to attract a local following. Journalist Dezső David Schön, who researched the Teitelbaum dynasty, wrote that Teitelbaum started to refer to himself as the &quot;Rebbe of Satmar&quot; around this point. Subsequently, he had tense relations with the first to claim the title: Yisaschar Dov Leifer, the son of Mordechai of Nadvorna. Leifer died on 12 September 1906.

=== Rabbinical career ===
In 1911, Teitelbaum was invited by the Jewish community in Ilosva (or Iršiva) to serve as their town&#x27;s rabbi. Although then part of Austria-Hungary, the town is now Irshava, Ukraine. During Teitelbaum&#x27;s residency, he established a local seminary and spread the ideas of Hasidism among the populace. Upon the outbreak of World War I, he returned to Satu Mare, where his former study hall gradually developed into a full-fledged seminary.

As a young rabbi, he clung to the positions of his father and grandfather. He forbade any contact with Zionists, including the Mizrachi (Religious Zionists), and supported Chaim Elazar Spira, the Rebbe of Munkacs, in his opposition to World Agudath Israel. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon (1920) following the war, Satu Mare, Partium, and Transylvania became part of the Kingdom of Romania.

The then-chief Orthodox rabbi of Satmar, Yehudah Greenwald, died on 9 March 1920. Several of Teitelbaum&#x27;s supporters advanced his name as a possible candidate for the vacant office, but he was opposed by the non-Hasidic Ashkenazi majority, modernists, and Zionists in the community (not to mention by many other Hasidim). Eventually, Eliezer David Greenwald (no relation to the former) was chosen. In 1922, after eight years outside the town, Teitelbaum returned to his community, Iršiva, then in Czechoslovakia.

On 29 March 1925, he was appointed chief rabbi of Krula. He moved to the city about a year afterward. On 21 January 1926, his older brother, Chaim Tzvi, died unexpectedly of an intracranial hemorrhage. Tzvi&#x27;s oldest son, Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum (II), was just fourteen years old. Although many of his followers suggested Joel succeed his brother, the custom prevailed, and the boy was given his father&#x27;s three posts. Yekusiel Judah Gross of Berbești was brought to serve as his tutor and &quot;de facto&quot; chief rabbi of Sighet.

Regardless, most of the Hasidim turned to Joel, who became the dynasty&#x27;s rebbe in all but title. When he grew older, Yekusiel established a following of his own from among his father&#x27;s loyal supporters, but his influence as rebbe never exceeded the city&#x27;s limits.

On 20 May 1928, Eliezer David Greenwald of Satmar died, and Teitelbaum ran for the municipal rabbi&#x27;s office again. An election committee established by the Orthodox community&#x27;s board chose him for the post on June 11, with nineteen members in favor, five against, and two abstentions. After a prolonged dispute with his opponents, the parties decided to hold an election among all members of the congregation. It occurred on August 9, and Teitelbaum received 437 votes in favor and 331 against.

The opposition did not accept the results. On 27 September, 779 approved Teitelbaum in a second vote, and only one member rejected him. Chaim Freund, the community&#x27;s president, and several other members of the board were close supporters of the rabbi, and his opponents accused them of rigging the vote throughout the election process by various means, including granting and withdrawing the right to participate according to criteria which benefited their candidate. Both sides sued their opponents in rabbinical courts and complained to the civilian authorities. The parties presented their claims in lengthy pamphlets printed in 1929: Freund&#x27;s faction issued a book under the name &quot;Milkhemes Mitzve haKhudosh&quot; (&quot;The New Commanded War&quot;), and the other one published &quot;Sfas Emes&quot; (&quot;Words of Truth&quot;).

Finally, following the continued refusal of many to accept Teitelbaum, his supporters established their own independent community on 10 December 1929, where he could serve as a rabbi. The fear of losing members&#x27; fees motivated the other party to negotiate. An agreement was reached on 11 June 1930, and Joel was invited to serve as Satmar&#x27;s chief rabbi. He chose not to accept the nomination until he was certain of support from the community council, which took three and a half years. Only then did he move, arriving on 27 February 1934. With 334 students, his rabbinical seminary became Satmar&#x27;s largest, having more pupils than the other three combined.

In August 1932, Teitelbaum visited Jerusalem. A small party there sought to appoint him as the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city in the wake of Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld&#x27;s death, but Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky eventually received the post. On 29 January 1936, Teitelbaum&#x27;s first wife, Chava, died. On 20 August 1937, he remarried with Alte Faige Shapiro, the orphaned 25-year-old daughter of Avigdor Shapiro from Częstochowa, who was half his age.
==== Incident with King Carol II of Romania ====
In the winter of 1936, the Romanian king Carol II visited the city of Satmar. A large parade consisting of thousands of soldiers and courtiers accompanied his arrival. The municipality prepared a large stage upon which all its religious and municipal leaders stood. Teitelbaum was accompanied by his son-in-law, Chananya Yom-Tov Lipa Teitelbaum, rabbi of Szemihály, and community leader Shmuel Rosenberg, and standing beside them were rabbis of the status quo and neolog communities, as well as other religious leaders.

When the king approached the stage, he surveyed all the people who stood on it and started walking toward Teitelbaum, who was holding his rabbinical stick in one hand and his hat in the other. Two priests began walking towards the king, but he ignored them. Teitelbaum, suddenly noticing what was happening, saluted and said the blessing &quot;Shenatan MiChvodo LiVnei Adam&quot; (lit. who gave from His (God&#x27;s) honor to human beings) - the Jewish blessing said when one meets a king. The king gave Teitelbaum his hand. The moment was documented by a Jewish photographer and was published in the Romanian press. Several days later, the king was asked why he approached the Orthodox rabbi first, and he responded: &quot;Immediately when I walked toward the stage, I surveyed all those who were standing on it. My heart was attracted to this rabbi due to his appearance that radiated spirituality (lit., Yiddishen geistlichen rabbiner).&quot; The king&#x27;s response was published in the country&#x27;s Jewish press.

=== World War II ===
In 1940, following the Second Vienna Award, Satmar again became part of Hungary.

Prior to the Holocaust, Teitelbaum ignored the threats to the Jews of Transylvania and failed to engage in the preparation of rescue and aid plans. As the situation of Hungarian Jews became dangerous, Teitelbaum equipped himself and his closest circle with certificates or visas that would facilitate their escape to Mandatory Palestine or the United States. At the same time, he thwarted all attempts at cooperation between the heads of the ultra-Orthodox communities and the Zionist organizations, which could have helped the rest of the Jewish community to escape. His daughter settled in Jerusalem, while he openly called on his followers to avoid immigrating.
Teitelbaum&#x27;s attempts to leave Hungary were part of a broader general phenomenon, which attracted criticism, even then, of rabbis and other public figures fleeing the country. When the Germans invaded Hungary, Teitelbaum&#x27;s closest associates sought a safer way to smuggle him out by bribing two junior officers, drivers of a Red Cross ambulance, who agreed to drive a group of Jews to Kolozsvár (today Cluj-Napoca) in return for money. The travelers included his family and several wealthy families who paid most of the costs. The attempt failed, and Teitelbaum was arrested and sent to Kolozsvár Ghetto. Faced with harsh living conditions, he asked his followers to try to transfer him to Budapest or back to the ghetto of Satmar, where Jews were housed in residential buildings, but they were unable to fulfill his requests. Baron Fülöp von Freudiger, director of the Orthodox congregation in Budapest, selected eighty rabbis and other prominent figures and paid for their inclusion in the passengers&#x27; list of the Kastner train, which was to depart the state for a neutral country. Teitelbaum put himself on the list even though a Zionist group organized the evacuation.

On 30 June 1944, once negotiations with the Germans had been concluded, the passengers boarded a freight train that was planned to proceed to Switzerland but was eventually diverted to Bergen Belsen. The group was held in a special section, in better conditions than those of other groups. Although the group included several notable figures, Teitelbaum was given special consideration. The group&#x27;s physician exempted him from roll calls, and volunteers performed the tasks imposed on him.

With the help of Kasztner and SS officer Herman Krumey, the final arrangements were made, and Teitelbaum was transferred to Switzerland with some Jews from the group. Upon his arrival in Switzerland, he was accorded preferential treatment by the authorities.

Eventually, he decided to immigrate to Mandatory Palestine. In August 1945, several hundreds of the Kastner train&#x27;s passengers, Teitelbaum among them, left Switzerland for the port of Taranto in Italy. On the 30th, they boarded the ship &quot;Ville d&#x27;Oran&quot;, which arrived in Haifa on the morning of 2 September. Teitelbaum resided in Jerusalem at the house of his nephew and son-in-law, Lipa Meir Teitelbaum.

When Joel Teitelbaum&#x27;s institutions became bankrupt after a year, he emigrated to the United States.

=== United States ===
The Satmar Rebbe arrived in New York on the second day of Rosh HaShana (27 September) 1946, aboard the motor vessel &quot;Vulcania&quot;. He settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with a small group of supporters.

In late April 1948, the Satmar Hasidim established &quot;Congregation Yetev Lev&quot;, named after his grandfather, which was registered as a religious corporation. The community&#x27;s regulations, accepted in April 1952, decreed that Teitelbaum was not a salaried officeholder but the supreme spiritual authority over the members.

In 1951, although not a resident of Israel, Teitelbaum was appointed to the ceremonial office of President of the anti-Zionist Edah HaChareidis (Congregation of God-Fearers) in Jerusalem. After the death of Zelig Reuven Bengis on 21 May 1953, he also succeeded him as the Chief Rabbi and Grand Patriarch of Edah HaChareidis Rabbinical Court. He visited Israel every few years.

In 1955, Teitelbaum founded the Central Rabbinical Congress, which he headed for the remainder of his life. From the early 1960s, Teitelbaum&#x27;s envoys sought to establish a rural settlement where the congregants could be secluded from the outside world. They eventually managed to purchase territory in Monroe, New York, where they built Kiryas Joel (Town of Joel). The first families settled there in 1974.

On 23 February 1968, Teitelbaum suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralyzed and barely functioning. His wife, backed by several sextons and other functionaries, became the behind-the-scenes power in Satmar. In the early hours of 19 August 1979, he complained of aches and was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he suffered a myocardial infarction and died at approximately 8am. Over 100,000 people attended his funeral in Kiryas Joel. He was succeeded by his nephew, Moshe Teitelbaum, the second son of his older brother.

== Opinions ==
=== Opposition to Zionism ===
Teitelbaum was well-known for his spoken and written opposition to Zionism. He encouraged his followers living in Israel to form self-sufficient communities without assistance from the State of Israel and forbade any official engagement with it.

Before World War II, most Hasidic rabbis—as well as many other prominent Orthodox rabbis and leaders—believed that God had promised to return the Jewish people to the Land of Israel under the leadership of the Messiah, who would arrive when the Jewish people had merited redemption. While awaiting the Messiah, the Jewish people were to perform the &quot;mitzvot&quot; and were not to antagonize or rebel against the Gentile nations of the world. In the years following the Holocaust, Teitelbaum strengthened this position.

In Teitelbaum&#x27;s view, the founding of the State of Israel by secular and religious Jews, rather than the Messiah, violated a Jewish commandment that Jews should wait for the Messiah. Moreover, Teitelbaum taught that the existence of the State of Israel was actually preventing the Messiah from coming.

==== Three oaths ====

The core citations from classical Judaic sources cited by Teitelbaum in his arguments against Zionism are based on a passage in the Talmud. Rabbi Jose bar Hanina explains in &quot;Ketubot&quot; 111a that God imposed &quot;three oaths&quot; on the nation of Israel: a) Israel should not return to the Land together using by force; b) Israel should not rebel against the nations (i.e., non-Jewish peoples); and c) the nations (i.e., non-Jews) should not subjugate Israel &quot;too harshly.&quot;

Teitelbaum argues that the second oath relates to the wars between Israel and neighboring Arab countries. He views the establishment of the State of Israel as an act of &quot;impatience,&quot; echoing the Talmud&#x27;s warning about the dangers of seeking God″s love with impatience. The Satmar Hasidim posit that the frequent wars the State of Israel is in are a result of ignoring this oath.

Teitelbaum saw his opposition to Zionism as a way of protecting Jews and preventing bloodshed. Apart from his opposition to the founding and existence of Israel as being violations of the &quot;Three Oaths&quot; and his opposition to Zionism as an idolatrous replacement of or addition to rabbinic Judaism, Teitelbaum held that participating in the Israeli government - especially voting in the elections - was prohibited. To do so, in his opinion, would make one a &quot;partner&quot; in all of the state&#x27;s &quot;anti-Torah&quot; policies and contribute to the spiritual and physical destruction of innocent people. Although many Haredi rabbis agree with the first two ideas, the general view of Agudat Yisrael and other Haredi rabbis is that the third idea - participating in the Israeli government - is permitted in order to rescue whatever is possible (in his words, &quot;saving from the mouth of the lion.&quot;) Teitelbaum, however, was openly opposed to the views of Agudath Israel, and, until the present time, Satmar Hasidim refused to become members of the organization. The Satmar view is that only the Moshiach can bring about a Jewish government in the Land of Israel. Even if a government declaring itself religious would be formed before the arrival of the Moshiach, it would be illegitimate due to its &quot;improper arrogation of power.&quot;

Although the Satmar Hasidim are opposed to the present government of Israel, many of them live in and visit Israel. Teitelbaum resided in Jerusalem for roughly one year after escaping from Europe and before the establishment of the State of Israel. He also visited Israel after moving to the United States.

=== Other opinions ===

Teitelbaum was very stringent in many particulars of Jewish law. He argued with Moshe Feinstein over the proper height of a &quot;mechitza&quot; (the partition between the sexes in the synagogue). Feinstein held that the &quot;mechitza&quot; needed to go only up to the shoulders of the average woman; Teitelbaum opined that the &quot;mechitza&quot; should not allow women to be seen at all.

Teitelbaum was strongly opposed to the use of a tube for &quot;metzitzah&quot; during circumcision of a baby boy and felt that this change in the procedure would spiritually lead to more promiscuity.

Teitelbaum encouraged all married Hasidic men to wear ceremonial fur hats. Although most Hasidic men in Hungary did not wear these before the war, Teitelbaum felt that in America, it was more important for people to look very different from the rest of the population to prevent assimilation, which was more rampant in America than in Hungary. He held that young men and women should not meet more than two or three times before getting engaged.

Teitelbaum stressed the importance of &quot;tznius&quot;. He was a strong proponent of the Hungarian Hasidic custom for married women to shave their heads every month before immersion in the &quot;mikveh&quot; (ritual bath). He recommended against wearing wigs by married women as he felt that the halakha prohibited this. Instead, Teitelbaum wanted women to cover their hair with something else, such as a turban. He insisted that all Satmar women and girls wear thick brown stockings with seams. The stockings had to be at least 90 deniers long. Due to the lack of such stockings, Teitelbaum encouraged one of his followers to manufacture the stockings. The stockings are called &quot;palm&quot; –the English translation of Teitelbaum&#x27;s last name.

Teitelbaum prohibited the ownership of a television. This was in the 1950s when TV was still heavily censored for promiscuous content. He bought and oversaw his own Yiddish-language newspaper, &quot;Der Yid&quot;, for two reasons: First, he felt that the other Yiddish newspapers at the time contained articles that were prohibited from reading because of their promiscuous content and lack of respect for Haredi leaders. Additionally, Teitelbaum wanted a platform from which to spread his ideas.

== Works ==
Some of the works Teitelbaum authored himself, or otherwise compiled by students:
* &quot;Vayoel Moshe&quot; (1958), explaining his belief that Zionism is prohibited by &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law)
* &quot;Al HaGeulah VeAl HaTemurah&quot; (1967, with N. Y. Meisels), further explaining his belief that Zionism is prohibited, in light of the Six-Day War
* &quot;Divrei Yoel&quot;, on the Chumash, Talmud, and Jewish festivals
* &quot;Kuntres Chidushai Torah&quot;, on the Chumash
* &quot;Kuntres Chidushai Torah&quot;, on the festivals
* &quot;Shu&quot;t Divrei Yoel&quot;, responsa on &quot;halakha&quot;
* &quot;Dibros Kodesh&quot;, sermons given at shalosh Seudos
* &quot;Agados Maharit&quot;, on the Talmud
* &quot;Tiv Levav&quot;, on the Chumash
* &quot;Rav Tuv&quot;, on the Chumash

Teitelbaum authored a brief introduction to the Talmudic tractate Shabbat for a Holocaust-era printing in Romania. There are collections of his speeches entitled &quot;Hidushei Torah MHR&quot;I Teitelbaum&quot;.
