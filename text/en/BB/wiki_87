<text>Apolo Anton Ohno (; born May 22, 1982) is an American retired short track speed skating competitor and an eight-time medalist (two gold, two silver, four bronze) in the Winter Olympics. Ohno is the most decorated American at the Winter Olympics and was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2017 and the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 2019.

Raised by his father, Ohno began training full-time in 1996. At the age of 14, he became the youngest U.S. national champion in 1997 and was the reigning champion from 2001 to 2009, winning the title a total of 12 times. In December 1999, he became the youngest skater to win a World Cup event title, and became the first American to win a World Cup overall title in 2001, which he won again in 2003 and 2005. Ohno has been the face of short track in the United States since winning his medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He won his first overall World Championship title at the 2008 championships.

Ohno&#x27;s accolades and accomplishments include the United States Olympic Committee&#x27;s Male Athlete of the Month in October 2003 and March 2008, U.S. Speedskating&#x27;s Athlete of the Year for 2003, and a finalist for the 2002, 2003, and 2006 Sullivan Award, which recognizes the best amateur athlete in the United States.

Since gaining recognition through his sport, Ohno has worked as a motivational speaker, philanthropist, started a nutritional supplement business, and won the 2007 season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Ohno later became host of a revival of &quot;Minute to Win It&quot; on Game Show Network and served as a commentator for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi and the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. Outside of competing, he has been an entrepreneur in the health, wellness, and technology industries.

==Early life==
Ohno was born in Seattle, Washington, to a Japanese-born father, and a European-American mother, Jerrie Lee. Ohno&#x27;s parents divorced when he was an infant, and he was raised in Seattle by his father. He has had little contact with his biological mother and as of 2002 had expressed no interest in knowing her or his older half-brother. Ohno&#x27;s father, a hair stylist and owner of the salon Yuki&#x27;s Diffusion, often worked 12-hour shifts, and with no extended family in the United States, found it hard to balance his career with raising a child. His father chose to name his son Apolo after the Greek words &quot;apo&quot;, which means to &quot;steer away from&quot; and &quot;lo&quot;, which means &quot;look out; here he comes.&quot;

When Ohno was very young, his father meticulously researched childcare providers to care for his son during his long work hours. As Apolo grew older, his father became concerned his son would become a latchkey kid, so Yuki got his son involved with competitive swimming and quad-speed roller skating at age 6. He later switched from the instruction of Benton Redford, a National Champion, to a team in Federal Way, Washington, called Pattison&#x27;s Team Extreme and became a national inline speedskating champion and record holder himself. His father used inline speed skating to fill his spare time. Ohno&#x27;s days were spent with morning swimming practices, followed by schooling, and finally skating practices in the afternoon.

When Ohno was 12, he won the Washington state championship in the breaststroke, but preferred inline speed skating over swimming. He has stated that by the time he turned 13, he attended parties with older teenagers if he did not have competitions on the weekends. His father has stated that it was a struggle balancing his son&#x27;s desire for independence while helping him reach his potential as a young athlete.

==Skating career==

===Beginnings===
When he was 13 years old, Ohno became interested in short track speed skating after seeing the sport during the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer. His father capitalized on this interest by driving him to short track competitions throughout the northwest United States and Canada, and Ohno won several competitions in his age divisions. His father wanted to encourage Ohno to develop his skills and, although Ohno was underage, he got him admitted to the Lake Placid Olympic Training Center in 1996 to train full-time for short track. At 13, Ohno was the youngest skater admitted to the center.

At first, Ohno&#x27;s commitment at Lake Placid was low until his teammates nicknamed him &quot;Chunky&quot;, which motivated him to train harder. In January, he failed to make the 1997 U.S. Junior World Team. Ohno adjusted his training and made a comeback winning the 1997 U.S. Senior Championships overall title, taking a gold medal in the 1500 m, a silver in the 300 m, and came in fourth in the 500 m races. At the age of 14, he became the youngest person to win the title. Ohno then relocated to the Colorado Springs Olympic Training Center to begin training with the senior level skaters, despite being only 14 years old.

However, Ohno would struggle at the 1997 World Championships in Nagano, Japan, finishing 19th overall. After this disappointing defeat at his first appearance at a world championships, Ohno returned home to Seattle. He did not train from April to August 1997, so he gained weight and was ill-prepared for the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics. As a result, he finished last in the Olympic trials and did not qualify for the Olympic team. Because of his losses at the World Championships and his failure to qualify for the Olympic team, Ohno recommitted himself to the sport and returned to junior-level skating at Lake Placid, rather than at Colorado Springs.

At the 1999 World Junior Championships, Ohno won first overall, placing first in the 1000 m and 1500 m, and winning silver in the 500 m. He won his second senior U.S. national championship in 1999. He finished fourth overall at the 1999 World Championships and earned a silver medal in the 500 m. At the 2000 U.S. Championships, Ohno was unable to defend his title and finished third overall. At the 2000 World Championships, Ohno finished ninth overall. In the 2000–2001 season, Ohno won his first World Cup overall title, regained his National title, and finished second overall in the World Championships, losing to Chinese skater Li Jiajun.

===2002 Winter Olympics===
====Qualification race controversy====
In December 2001, during the U.S. Short Track Speed Skating 2002 Olympic Trials, speed skater Shani Davis was racing for a position on the short track team. Ohno and fellow skater Rusty Smith had already earned slots on the six-man team due to points earned from earlier races. In order for Davis to qualify, he had to place first in the final race—the 1000 m—by overcoming stronger skaters Ohno, Smith, and Ron Biondo. Since Ohno had been dominant in the meet to this point by winning every race he entered, a win by Davis seemed to be unlikely.

Though Ohno, Smith, and Biondo were heavily favored to win the 1000 m, the race ended with Ohno finishing third, Smith second, and Davis at the top of the podium. Prior to crossing the finish line, Ohno started celebrating for Davis and Smith. Davis&#x27; first-place finish earned enough points to move past Tommy O&#x27;Hare in the final point standings and to qualify for sixth place. By finishing second, Smith earned the opportunity to skate individually in the 1000 m. The victory celebration was short-lived as rumors began that Ohno and Smith, both good friends of Davis, intentionally threw the race so Davis would win.

After returning to Colorado Springs, O&#x27;Hare, who did not skate in the 1000 m, filed a formal complaint. The complaint was founded on Ohno&#x27;s seemingly deliberate attempt to stop Biondo from being able to pass Smith. Because of that blocking move on Biondo, Smith finished in second place and Davis finished first. For three days, Ohno, Smith, and Davis stood before an arbitration panel of the United States Olympic Committee. During the hearing, Davis was never accused of being at fault and Smith made the statement: &quot;Any allegation that there was a fix, conspiracy, or understanding between Apolo and me, or anyone else, to let Shani win the race is completely false. Shani is a great athlete, skated a great race, and deserves to be on the team.&quot; The final verdict was that O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s claims went unproven, all three were absolved of guilt, and the claim was dismissed. After the dismissal, Ohno stated, &quot;I am thrilled that the arbitration process has officially vindicated me... As I&#x27;ve said since the moment of these accusations, they were untrue and I did nothing wrong&quot;.

====Games====
At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, Ohno emerged as the face of short-track speed skating among American fans. He was a medalist in two events but there was controversy associated with the results.

After a disqualification in the 500 m race, he was leading the skaters in the 1000 m race. During a turn around the final corner, Ohno, Ahn Hyun Soo, Li Jiajun, and Mathieu Turcotte all fell in a series of collisions. The last man standing was Steven Bradbury from Australia, who was trailing behind at the time, and skated through to win the gold medal, becoming the first person from the southern hemisphere to win a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. Ohno quickly got to his feet and crossed the finish line to win silver with Turcotte winning the bronze. Ohno, coincidentally, was wearing skates made by Bradbury&#x27;s own boot company, Revolutionary Boot Company. Bradbury emailed Ohno, saying &quot;If you win gold, make sure you give me a mention!&quot;
In the 1500 m final race A, with one lap remaining and currently in second place, Ohno attempted to make a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung of South Korea, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno raised his arms to imply he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno, but the Australian referee James Hewish disqualified Kim for what appeared to be impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. The South Korean team immediately protested the decision, appealing to the International Skating Union (ISU), the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The challenges were all denied after video review. South Korean media accused Ohno of simulating a foul, using the Konglish word &quot;Hollywood action&quot;.

The disqualification of Kim upset South Korean supporters, many of whom directed their anger at Ohno and the IOC. A large number of e-mails protesting the race results crashed the IOC&#x27;s email server, and thousands of accusatory letters, many of which contained death threats, were sent to Ohno and the IOC. Ohno shared his thoughts on the Koreans&#x27; hostile reaction by saying, &quot;I was really bothered by it. I grew up around many Asian cultures, Korean one of them. A lot of my best friends were Korean growing up. I just didn&#x27;t understand. Later on I realized that was built up by certain people and that was directed at me, negative energy from other things, not even resulting around the sport, but around politics, using me to stand on the pedestal as the anti-American sentiment&quot;.

===After Salt Lake===
Ohno continued to perform well in the sport after the 2002 Winter Games. He declined to participate in a 2003 World Cup short-track event in Korea for security reasons. Despite the absence, he successfully defended his World Cup title during the 2003 season. He continued his dominance by winning the World Cup title again in the 2004–2005 season.

At the first event of the 2005 World Cup event in China, Ohno severely sprained his ankle and withdrew from the event. At the second event in South Korea, an estimated 100 riot police stood guard at Incheon International Airport to prevent harm from happening to Ohno. Their concern stemmed from a possible lingering negative reaction from the 2002 Olympic Games disqualification controversy.

Ohno won two gold medals, as well as the overall title at the meet despite suffering from a severe stomach illness, and was surprised when the Korean crowd cheered his victories, saying, &quot;I was really happy with the crowd&#x27;s reaction. It was pretty positive right from the time we landed. I was really happy it wasn&#x27;t (hostile). Everything went really smooth. We were happy.&quot; He was unable to defend his World Cup title from the previous three seasons, finishing third in the 2005–2006 overall standings. At the 2005 World Championships, he finished second overall, winning the 1000 m and 3000 m races.

===2006 Winter Olympics===

In the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Ohno stumbled during a semifinal heat in the 1500 m. Finishing fifth, he was unable to defend his 2002 gold medal in the event. Ohno was able to win the bronze medal in the 1000 m, with Korean skaters Ahn Hyun Soo and Lee Ho-suk finishing before him.

After two false starts from other skaters, Ohno won gold in the 500 m when he took the lead with an explosive start and held it until the finish. Despite criticism that he appeared to move before the start, a violation of the rules, the race start was validated by the officials. Afterward, Ohno said, &quot;I was in the moment at the time. I thought I timed the start just perfect. The starter had been pretty quick all day, so that&#x27;s why there were so many false starts at the beginning. But that was really good for me.&quot;

On the same day as his 500 m gold win, he earned a bronze medal in the men&#x27;s 5000 m relay, with an inside pass on Italian skater Nicola Rodigari on the final leg to put the United States in third position. Later, during the medals ceremony for the event, the winning South Korean team and the Americans embraced, followed by a group picture featuring the medalists.

===Post-Olympic hiatus and return===
Having taken a year off from competitive skating when the 2006 Winter Olympics ended, Ohno returned to win his eighth national title, placing first in every event during the U.S. Championships held from February 23–25, 2007. On April 26, 2007, he was inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame, an award which honors achievements of Asian Americans.

From March 9–11, 2007, he competed at the 2007 World Championships held in Milan, Italy, winning gold in the 1500 m due to the disqualification of Song Kyung-Taek, who had blocked a passing attempt made by Ohno. He won bronze in the 1000 m, 3000 m, and the 5000 m relay with teammates, Jordan Malone, Travis Jayner, and Ryan Bedford. Because of his wins, he became the overall bronze medalist, behind silver medalist Charles Hamelin and Ahn Hyun Soo, who became the first man to become a five-time World Champion.

On December 24, 2007, in Kearns, Utah, Ohno won his ninth national title, finishing first in the 1000 m and the 1500 m. He also finished first in the 500 m, but was disqualified for crosstracking. In the 3000 m, he finished second. At the 2008 World Championships in Gangneung, South Korea, Ohno won his first overall title, placing first place in the 500 m, second in the 1000 m, and third place in the 3000 m. He defeated South Koreans Lee Ho-Suk, silver medalist and Song Kyung-Taek who finished third in points. He was initially met with loud booing by the crowd, but managed to earn their applause with a clean skate in the 500 m.

In 2009, he won his 10th national title and qualified for the world team. Unable to defend his championship, he finished fifth in the overall rankings at the 2009 World Championships in Vienna, Austria, placing second at the 1000 m, and winning gold with the 5000 m relay team.

===2010 Winter Olympics===

In preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over from his weight at the 2002 Winter Games. He went down to a bodyframe and a 2.5% body fat percentage, enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: &quot;Come these Games, there&#x27;s no one who&#x27;s going to be fitter than me. There&#x27;s just no way. Whether I can put it together on the ice or not and feel good, that&#x27;s a different story. But I know, from a physical training standpoint, nobody&#x27;s even close... I&#x27;ve never prepared like this in my life—for anything. I want to leave nothing on the table.&quot;

====Trials====
During the U.S. Olympic Trials held September 8–12, 2009, in Marquette, Michigan, Ohno won the overall meet title and defended his national title. He won the finals during the 500 m, 1000 m, and 1500 m races. However, during the 1000 m time trial, Ohno came in second to J. R. Celski despite skating a personal best of 1:24.500 to Celski&#x27;s personal best of 1:23.981. Celski, who finished second overall and was leading in points after the first two nights of the trials, was injured during a crash in the semifinals of the 1000 m race when his right skate sliced into his left leg; he did not skate in the 1000 m finals. Ohno had a narrow victory in the 500 m, beating out the silver place finisher Jeff Simon by only .039 of a second. Ohno, Celski, Jordan Malone, Travis Jayner, and Simon Cho were the top five finishers at the trials. Afterwards, Ohno said of the nominated team: &quot;This is the strongest team we&#x27;ve ever had. I feel really good about how we will do in the next Olympics.&quot;

====Games====
In the 1500 m final, Ohno placed second after two Korean skaters, Lee Ho-Suk and Sung Si-Bak, made contact and crashed into the wall during the final turn of the final lap. He was in fourth place leading into the crash, and moved into second place as a result, earning the silver. Fellow American skater J. R. Celski finished with the bronze medal. The gold medal went to South Korea&#x27;s Lee Jung-Su. Lee Jung-Su criticized Ohno as &quot;too aggressive&quot; in a post-race news conference. Ohno stated in an interview that he was held by one of the Korean skaters, which possibly prevented him from winning gold. He drew anger in South Korea after adding, &quot;I was hoping for another disqualification, kind of like what happened in Salt Lake City.&quot; Ohno&#x27;s silver pushed his tally to six career Olympic medals, tying Bonnie Blair for most medals ever won by a U.S. Winter Olympian.

Heading into the 1000 m final, Ohno had won the overall silver medal for the 1000 m during the 2009–10 World Cup by competing in three of the four competitions during the season. During the finals of the 1000 m, Ohno finished in third place, making a comeback from a slip with less than three laps remaining. With the bronze medal win, he became the most decorated American athlete ever at the Winter Games with seven career medals. Bonnie Blair, the former record holder, said she was happy for his accomplishment, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s a great feat for him, U.S. speedskating, and the United States of America. We hope that more kids will see his accomplishments and want to try our great sport that has been so good to us and taught us so much about what it takes to be successful in life.&quot;

In the 500 m final, Ohno finished the race in second place behind Canada&#x27;s Charles Hamelin. However, he was disqualified after impeding François-Louis Tremblay of Canada around the final turn. The silver medal went to Sung Si-Bak, with Tremblay taking the bronze.

The 5000 m relay team for the United States finished with the bronze medal. The team, consisting of J. R. Celski, Simon Cho, Travis Jayner, Jordan Malone, and Ohno, were in the fourth position for the majority of the race. With a strong push from Celski with two laps to go, Ohno as the anchor leg was able to pass the Chinese team for third place; Canada won the gold and South Korea took silver. This bronze medal was the eighth Olympic medal of his career.

===Sponsorships===

Using his recognition and fame from his sport, he has accumulated a list of sponsors that includes McDonald&#x27;s, General Electric, The Century Council, Vicks, and Coca-Cola. Ohno&#x27;s father, Yuki, said about sponsorships: &quot;He&#x27;s not like a professional athlete who has a multi-million-dollar contract with a team... He has to have sponsorships to pay the bills&quot;. Capitalizing on Ohno&#x27;s fame, Alaska Airlines was his primary sponsor for the 2010 Winter Games and designed a Boeing 737-800 jet with his image on the side.

On the other hand, Ohno has criticized the lack of support for athletes who are not at the very pinnacle of their sport. In the HBO documentary &quot;The Weight Of Gold&quot; (2020), Ohno characterized the attitude of potential sponsors as &quot;How many golds do you have because if you&#x27;re silver, you&#x27;re not making money. You&#x27;re bronze? You&#x27;re not making money. You didn&#x27;t medal? I don&#x27;t even know your name, pal. Go back to the end of the line, OK?&quot;

He was critical of the leaders of the U.S. Speedskating Organization when a donation of $250,000 was raised by viewers of the Comedy Central show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; for the organization after their largest commercial sponsor, the Dutch DSB Bank, declared bankruptcy and was unable to donate its $300,000 in November 2009. In an email to &quot;Time&quot;, he wrote it was &quot;a bit embarrassing that our leadership couldn&#x27;t secure other sponsors three months before the Olympic Games&quot; but credited the show&#x27;s host Stephen Colbert for &quot;his willingness to help out our nation&#x27;s greatest athletes&quot;. In return for &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; donation, long track and short track skaters had the &quot;Colbert Nation&quot; logo on their uniforms for World Cup events leading up to the 2010 Winter Games. Ohno did not wear the logo because Alaska Airlines was his primary sponsor for the 2010 Games. He was also part of Oreo&#x27;s Team DSRL sketch in 2011.

==Legacy==
During his skating career in the United States, Ohno is credited with popularizing and being the face of his sport. He said it is amazing being able to be a role model to younger skaters since growing up, he did not have that influence within his sport, but looked up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. After the 2010 Winter Games, he created the Apolo Anton Ohno Foundation and partnered with the Century Council&#x27;s Ask, Listen, Learn Program to discourage underage drinking of alcohol and to promote a healthy lifestyle.

===Retirement===

Ohno retired after the 2010 Olympics and appeared on NBC as a commentator for the 2014 Sochi Games and 2018 Pyeongchang Games. In November 2014 Ohno sponsored a speedskating race in Salt Lake City, Utah, that featured the four top men and women skaters from the US, China, Canada and the Netherlands. He has appeared in a number of television shows as a host, actor and guest star since his retirement.

In 2019, he was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. Also in 2019, he announced he is writing a book that chronicles his transition from Olympic athlete to entrepreneur. He says the book will &quot;...pull back the curtain, in a sense, and showcases all the inner workings that go into making an Olympic athlete and then also the other side of what happens after day 17 of the Games when you&#x27;re no longer competing. You&#x27;re at the top of your game, you&#x27;re in top physical condition, top mental condition, and now you&#x27;re thrust into a world that is very unfamiliar to you and you feel like an alien&quot;. The book, &quot;Hard Pivot&quot; is scheduled for a winter 2022 release.

===Activism===
Ohno has supported several causes. He participated in GAP&#x27;s campaign to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa by joining Product Red. Half of the proceeds went to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Besides working with The Salvation Army and the Clothes off our Back Foundations, he used his fame to help raise funds for a Ronald McDonald House in Seattle after the 2002 Winter Games. He helped raise $20,000 for Nikkei Concerns, a provider of care and services for Japanese elders living in the Pacific Northwest. Later that year, Ohno joined Senator Ted Kennedy in Washington, D.C. to show the importance of math and science education by helping launch the &quot;Math Moves U Hippest Homework Happening&quot; program, which gave students the opportunity to do math homework online with celebrities and athletes.

He has also volunteered with the Special Olympics and taken part in Unified Sports, which brings together athletes with intellectual disabilities and without on the same team. Ohno served as a Special Olympics Global Ambassador ahead of the 2015 World Summer Games in Los Angeles, California. He continues to serve as a Special Olympics Global Ambassador.

==Television career==
Ohno has had an interest in pursuing a career in the entertainment world. He participated and won the fourth season of the U.S. reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with his partner Julianne Hough. He returned for the 15th season which featured all-star celebrities. Ohno&#x27;s interests in fashion led him to be a guest judge on the fashion reality show &quot;Project Runway&quot; in 2008, and to an endorsement deal with Omega, the maker of luxury watches, in 2010. Omega president Stephen Urquhart said, &quot;We are very proud to support Apolo here in Vancouver and congratulate him on his outstanding performance. He is poised to make history of his own here and we are thrilled that he is part of the Omega family&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Minute to Win It&quot; as the host of the GSN revival in 2013 since he is a fan of the show.

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===
====Season 4 (with Julianne Hough)====
Ohno participated on the fourth season of the reality show, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was paired with professional dancer Julianne Hough, and both appeared on the show for the first time on March 19, 2007. Together, they received the competition&#x27;s first perfect score of 30 for their samba routine on April 16, 2007. They were crowned the champions in May 22, 2007.


====Season 15 (with Karina Smirnoff)====
In July 2012, it was announced Ohno would return for the fifteenth season, which was an All-Star season made up entirely of stars who had previously competed. This time, he was paired with season 13 champion Karina Smirnoff. They were voted off during the ninth week of the competition.


===Other appearances===
Ohno has appeared in a number of television shows as a guest star, an actor and as a host. He guest-starred in the 17th episode of the 2nd season of &quot;Hawaii Five-0,&quot; (2012) as a suspect and guest starred in &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; in Season 12, Episode 9 and Season 15, Episode 12. He appeared as the live guest during the season finale of NBC&#x27;s live variety show &quot;Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris&quot; in 2015. The following year, Ohno appeared as a guest star on &quot;Hollywood Game Night&quot; hosted by Jane Lynch on NBC. Ohno also appeared in the Nick Jr. series Ryan&#x27;s Mystery Playdate.

<text>Badlands are a type of dry terrain where softer sedimentary rocks and clay-rich soils have been extensively eroded. They are characterized by steep slopes, minimal vegetation, lack of a substantial regolith, and high drainage density. Ravines, gullies, buttes, hoodoos and other such geologic forms are common in badlands.

Badlands are found on every continent except Antarctica, being most common where there are unconsolidated sediments. They are often difficult to navigate by foot, and are unsuitable for agriculture. Most are a result of natural processes, but destruction of vegetation by overgrazing or pollution can produce anthropogenic badlands.

==Badlands topography==

Badlands are characterized by a distinctive badlands topography. This is terrain in which water erosion has cut a very large number of deep drainage channels, separated by short, steep ridges (&quot;interfluves&quot;). Such a drainage system is said to have a very fine drainage texture, as measured by its &quot;drainage density&quot;. Drainage density is defined as the total length of drainage channels per unit area of land surface. Badlands have a very high drainage density of . The numerous deep drainage channels and high interfluves creates a stark landscape of hills, gullies, and ravines.
In addition to a dense system of drainages and interfluves, badlands often contain buttes and hoodoos. These are formed by resistant beds of sandstone, which form the caprock of the buttes and hoodoos.

==Origin==
Badlands arise from a combination of an impermeable but easily eroded ground surface, sparse vegetation, and infrequent but heavy rainfall. The surface bedrock is typically mudrock, sometimes with evaporites, with only occasional beds of more resistant sandstone. Infrequent heavy rains lead to heavy erosional dissection. Where sudden precipitation cannot penetrate impermeable clays, it is channeled into a very dense system of streamlets that erode a dense system of ever-enlarging, coalescing gulleys and ravines. Erosion is enhanced by pelting raindrops that dislodge soft sediments. The presence of bentonite clay further increases erodibility, as can rejuvenation of the drainage system from regional uplift, as occurred at Badlands National Park.

In addition to surface erosion, badlands sometimes have well-developed &quot;piping&quot;, which is a system of pipes, joints, caverns, and other connected void spaces in the subsurface through which water can drain. However, this is not a universal feature of badlands. For example, the Henry Mountains badlands show very little piping.

The precise processes by which the erosion responses take place vary depending on the precise interbedding of the sedimentary material. However, it has been estimated that the badlands of Badlands National Park erode at the relatively high rate of about per year. The White River draining Badlands National Park was so named for its heavy load of bentonite clay eroded from the badlands.

===Regolith===
Badlands are partially characterized by their thin to nonexistent regolith layers. The regolith profiles of badlands in arid climates are likely to resemble one another. In these regions, the upper layer (~) is typically composed of silt, shale, and sand (a byproduct of the weathered shale). This layer can form either a compact crust or a looser, more irregular aggregation of &quot;popcorn&quot; fragments. Located beneath the top layer is a sublayer (~), below which can be found a transitional shard layer (~), formed largely of loose disaggregated shale chips, which in turn eventually gives way to a layer of unweathered shale. Badlands such as those found in the Mancos Shale, the Brule Formation, the Chadron Formation, and the Dinosaur Provincial Park can be generally said to fit this profile.

In less arid regions, the regolith profile can vary considerably. Some badlands have no regolith layer whatsoever, capping instead in bare rock such as sandstone. Others have a regolith with a clay veneer, and still others have a biological crust of algae or lichens.

In addition to lacking significant regolith, they also lack much vegetation. The lack of vegetation could very well be a result of the lack of a substantial regolith.

===Anthropogenic badlands===

Although most badland topography is natural, badlands have been produced artificially by destruction of vegetation cover, through overgrazing, acid rain, or acid mine drainage. The Cheltenham Badlands in Caledon, Ontario are an example of badlands produced by poor farming practices. In the early 1900s, the area was used for agricultural purposes, predominantly cattle grazing. Agricultural use ceased by 1931 and natural recovery of the majority of the property began. Once established, however, this type of erosion can continue rapidly, if land clearing, overgrazing, and increased foot traffic by humans persists, as the shale is highly susceptible to erosion.

An example of badlands created by mining is the Roman gold mine of Las Médulas in northern Spain.

The word &quot;badlands&quot; is a calque from the Canadian French phrase , as the early French fur traders called the White River badlands or &#x27;bad lands to traverse&#x27;, perhaps influenced by the Lakota people who moved there in the late 1700s and who referred to the terrain as , meaning &#x27;bad land&#x27; or &#x27;eroded land&#x27;.

The term &quot;malpaís&quot; means &#x27;badlands&#x27; in Spanish, but refers to a terrain of lava flows that is unlike the eroded badlands of the White River.

==Human impact==
Badlands are generally unsuitable for agriculture, but attempts have been made to remediate badlands. For example, reforestation is being attempted in the Garbeta badlands of Eastern India. Revegetation and reforestation have been studied in the black marl badlands of the French Alps. Austrian black pine can become established and then be gradually replaced by native deciduous species. However, the time scale for this process is many decades.

==Locations==

Badlands are found on all the continents except Antarctica. The presence of unconsolidated sediments is a strong control on their locations.

===Argentina===
The Valle de la Luna (&quot;Valley of the Moon&quot;) is one of many examples of badland formations in midwestern Argentina.

===Canada===

The Cheltenham Badlands are in Caledon, Ontario, not far from Canada&#x27;s largest city Toronto.

The Big Muddy Badlands in Saskatchewan gained notoriety as a hideout for outlaws.

There is a large badland area in Alberta, particularly in the valley of the Red Deer River, where Dinosaur Provincial Park is located, as well as in Drumheller, where the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology is located.

===China===
Zhangye National Geopark is a badlands area known for its colorful rock formations. It was voted by Chinese media outlets as one of the most beautiful landforms in China and became a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2019.

===India===
Garbeta, Eastern India is a badlands located in a monsoon climate. Chambal spread across northern parts of Madhya Pradesh, southeastern Rajasthan and southern parts of Uttar Pradesh known for its lawlessness and dacoity is another example of badlands. A small strip of badlands is also found in western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.

===Italy===
In Italy, badlands are called &quot;calanchi&quot;. Some examples are Aliano (Basilicata), Crete Senesi (Tuscany) and Civita di Bagnoregio (Lazio).

===New Zealand===
A well-known badlands formation in New Zealand – the Pūtangirua Pinnacles, formed by the erosion of the conglomerate of an old alluvial fan – is located at the head of a small valley near the southern tip of the North Island.

===Spain===
The Bardenas Reales near Tudela, Navarre, the Tabernas Desert in Tabernas, Almería, parts of the Granada Altiplano near Guadix and possibly Los Monegros in Aragon are examples of Spanish badlands.

===Turkey===
Turkey has extensive badlands, including Göreme National Park.

===United States===

In the U.S., Makoshika State Park in Montana and Badlands National Park in South Dakota are examples of extensive badland formations. Also located in this region is Theodore Roosevelt National Park, a United States National Park composed of three geographically separated areas of badlands in western North Dakota named after former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona which is part of Navajo County encompasses numerous badlands that also abuts the Navajo Indian Reservation and is directly north of Joseph City, Arizona. Many dinosaurs are believed to be buried in the immediate area and exploration has been ongoing since the early 20th century.

Among the Henry Mountains area in Utah, about above sea level, Cretaceous- and Jurassic-aged shales are exposed. Another popular area of badland formations is Toadstool Geologic Park in the Oglala National Grassland located in northwestern Nebraska. Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah are also badlands settings, along with several other areas in southern Utah, such as the Chinle Badlands in Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument. A small badland called Hell&#x27;s Half-Acre is present in Natrona County, Wyoming. Additional badlands also exist in various places throughout southwest Wyoming, such as near Pinedale and in the Bridger Valley near the towns of Lyman and Mountain View, near the high Uintah Mountains. Pinnacles National Park in California also has areas of badlands, as does the Mojave Desert in eastern California.

==Culture and media==
Badlands have become a popular trope inside various media, particularly westerns.

<text>I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got is the second studio album by Irish singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, released in March 1990 by Ensign/Chrysalis Records. It contains O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s version of the Prince song &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, which was released as a single and reached number one in multiple countries. The album was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 1991, including Record of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Best Music Video, Short Form for &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, winning the award for Best Alternative Music Performance. However, O&#x27;Connor refused to accept the nominations and award. The album has sold over seven million copies worldwide. 

==Content==
The critically-acclaimed album contains O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s most famous single, &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, which was one of the best-selling singles in the world in 1990, topping the charts in many countries including the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada. This rendition of the Prince song reflected on O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s mother, who had died in an auto accident five years earlier. The single &quot;Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; found moderate success, although it did top the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the US.

The first song on the album, &quot;Feel So Different&quot;, starts with &quot;&quot; by Reinhold Niebuhr. The album also includes O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s rendition of &quot;I Am Stretched on Your Grave&quot;, an anonymous 17th-century poem that was written in Irish, translated into English by Frank O&#x27;Connor, and composed by musician Philip King in 1979.

<doc id="239026" wikidata="Q578742" url="?curid=239026" title="Ich Troje">
<text>Ich Troje (&quot;The Three of Them&quot;) is a Polish pop band. Ich Troje was founded in 1996 by songwriter Michał Wiśniewski and composer Jacek Łągwa. Since 2000, Ich Troje has been one of the most successful Polish groups. They have sold more than 1.5 million records since June 2001. Their songs are typically about love, betrayal and break-ups. They represented Poland in the Eurovision Song Contest twice: with &quot;Keine Grenzen – Żadnych granic&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Follow My Heart&quot; in 2006.

==Members==
Former members are Magdalena Pokora (a.k.a. Magda Femme, 1996–2000), Justyna Majkowska (2000–2003), Elli Mücke (2003) and Ania Wisniewska (2003–2010). After a series of auditions including fan votes, Norwegian singer Jeanette Vik was in December 2010 chosen as the band&#x27;s next lead singer.

==Eurovision 2003==
On 25 January 2003, Polish TV viewers chose Ich Troje to represent them in 2003 Eurovision Song Contest by televoting. The band took part in the contest with the song &quot;Keine Grenzen – Żadnych granic&quot; (English translation: &quot;No Borders&quot;), a trilingual song performed in German, Polish and Russian. The song is a dramatic ballad, in which the singers express their desire to be astronauts, gazing down from space at the earth. As well as the beauty of the spectacle, they sing that from that distance it is impossible to see borders, flags and warfare. The theme of the need for peace is underscored by the multilingual lyrics, in which Polish is performed alongside the languages of two neighbouring states which have historically fought with Poland. The song received the maximum 12 points from Germany but none from Russia. The song finished 7th in a field of 26 entries.

A fully German version of the song was recorded as well. Another trilingual version (French, English, Esperanto) was recorded in 2016.

==Eurovision 2006==
The group setup was arranged to add a fifth member when taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, by adding the German rapper O-Jay (Olaf Jeglitza) of the German Eurodance act, Real McCoy. For Eurovision, credit was Ich Troje featuring Real McCoy and the song was &quot;Follow My Heart&quot;. Their music was castigated by critics. The song finished 11th in the semi-final failing to qualify to the final.

<doc id="239027" wikidata="Q2394508" url="?curid=239027" title="Superstar Car Wash">
<text>Superstar Car Wash is the fourth studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls, released on February 23, 1993 on Warner Bros. John Rzeznik wrote the song &quot;We Are the Normal&quot; with his idol, The Replacements&#x27; singer Paul Westerberg. The two corresponded by mail but never sat in a studio together. The song &quot;Fallin&#x27; Down&quot; was featured in the 1993 Pauly Shore movie &quot;Son In Law&quot;. Also, the song &quot;So Far Away&quot; was originally written and recorded with the title &quot;Dancing In Your Blood&quot;; the song had the same basic structure, but different lyrics, more minimal instrumentation, and a slightly different melody.

Superstar Car Wash was an actual car washing business on William Street just outside the downtown region of Buffalo, the hometown of the band.

Remixed versions of songs &quot;Fallin&#x27; Down&quot;, &quot;Another Second Time Around&quot;, &quot;Cuz You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, &quot;We Are The Normal&quot;, &quot;Girl Right Next To Me&quot;, &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, and &quot;On The Lie&quot; appear in the 2001&#x27;s compilation What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art &amp; Commerce. These mixes sound slightly different from their original versions, with crisper and clearer background noises, such as accompanying acoustic guitars and choruses which have been emphasized.

==Musical style==
&quot;Billboard&quot; described the album&#x27;s sound as a mix of punk rock, pop and metal. &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought that the album mostly &quot;[remained] in familiar power-pop territory&quot;, but also had &quot;occasional ventures toward metal or punk.&quot; &quot;Buffalo News&quot; called the album an &quot;alternative-pop masterpiece&quot;, stating that the band had &quot;taken their heavy metal, punk and garage rock roots and combined them with a softer pop style.&quot; &quot;Vice&quot; described the album as simply hard rock.

==Reception==
The album was met with highly positive critical reception. AllMusic gave the album four-out-of-five stars saying that the band let loose and channeled their playful immaturity throughout the attractive impurity of this album.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album an &#x27;A&#x27; rating. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; rated the album 8-out-of-10, saying that the band &quot;have an arrow in their quiver that might hit the mark this time.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the album a 3.5/4.

<text>Cat Scratch Fever is the third studio album by American rock musician Ted Nugent. It was released on May 13, 1977, by Epic Records.

<doc id="239032" wikidata="Q3267963" url="?curid=239032" title="Cultural control">
<text>In agriculture cultural control is the practice of modifying the growing environment to reduce the prevalence of unwanted pests. Examples include changing soil pH or fertility levels, irrigation practices, amount of sunlight, temperature, or the use of beneficial animals (e.g. chickens) or insects (e.g. ladybugs) (biological control). Cultural control can help avoid pest population build-up, strengthen the overall resilience of a farming system and thereby reduce a need for curative interventions e.g., chemical pesticide applications. As such, a systematic implementation of cultural control practices can avert pesticide-induced detrimental effects on farmland biodiversity and the environment. Cultural control is the use of crops rotation, resistant varieties, tillage practice, regular weeding, fallowing, timeless planting, uprooting and burning infected crops.

<text>Nose piercing is the piercing of the skin or cartilage which forms any part of the nose, normally for the purpose of wearing jewelry, called a nose-jewel. Among the different varieties of nose piercings, the nostril piercing is the most common.

==History==
Nose piercing is recorded in various parts of the world, including in some indigenous societies of Americas and Australia.

Earliest written evidence of nose piercing appears in the Book of Genesis. According to Barry Ladizinski et al. 2013 &quot;The practice, which is performed for symbolic or beautification purposes, originated more than 4000 years ago in the Middle East, migrating to India in the 1500s and reaching Western civilization by the 20th century.&quot;

Nose piercing remains a significant cultural and aesthetic practice, symbolizing beauty, identity, and tradition across diverse societies worldwide.
In Americas, nose piercing can be dated through pre-Columbian and colonial times throughout North and South America. Numerous status ceremonies are carved into the North Temple of the Great Ballcourt at Chichin Itza. One of these ceremonies is a nose piercing ritual that is illustrated on the North Temple vault. Rather than depicting sacrifice, the common theme of the temple&#x27;s carvings, the central figure is shown aiming what most likely is a bone awl to pierce the figure&#x27;s nose. The ritual of the nostril piercing signified the elevated status of this figure. His place in society is symbolized by his nose piercing. Similarly, nose piercing signified elevated status in Colonial Highland Maya. The two prominent lords, Ajpop and the Ajpop K&#x27;ama, of the K&#x27;iche were pierced through the nose at the pinnacle of an elaborate ceremony. Similar to a crowning of a king, the nose piercing was to show their newfound leadership of the K&#x27;iche.

In Yucatán, explorers Oviedo y Valdes, Herrera y Tordesillas, Diego de Landa, and Jeronimo de Aguilar all noted different nose piercings that they observed in Mayans and other cultures in Yucatán in general. They reported that different stones could have different meaning within each civilization. In addition, they believed the different placement and size and shape of beads could denote the specific society the person came from. The Toltecs were believed to have piercings through the ala of the nose that was adorned with a bead. While the Mayans pierced through the septum and consisted of an oblong bead rather than spherical.

Since the introduction and diffusion in western culture in the 1960s, punks and subsequent youth cultures of the 1980s and 1990s adopted nostril piercing. Today, nostril piercing is popular in the wider world including South America, United States of America, Canada, the Caribbean, Australia, Africa, Japan and Europe, with piercings being performed on either the left or right nostril. For some cultures, this practice is simply for ornament, while for others it is for religious practices. Initially in America, this practice was for subcultures and was seen to be associated with minority youth.

In the United States, nose piercings may have negative connotations. For example, in a 2006 survey done in the hospitality industry, 81% of hiring managers stated that piercings and tattoos affect their perception of the candidate negatively.

==Nostril piercing==
Nostril piercing is a body piercing practice that allows the insertion of jewelry into the nostrils. The historical record in Egypt only indicates nose piercings being worn by women. The specifics of jewelry in Egypt are regional, though some form of nose piercing has been known throughout Egypt, by urban and desert dwelling women. An exception is Siwa- while other women in Marsa Matruh wore nose rings, Siwi women do not. In Upper Egypt the nose ring is commonly called a Khuzam, a name used since the 1830s. According to Lane, the nose rings of his time were an inch to an inch and a half diameter of brass, strung with beads, and worn on the right side of the nose.

In Bahariya, the nose piercing is called the gatar or qatrah, made from 12 carat gold, with filigree and granulation. Commonly, the design is a ring with decoration around the lower half (on some nose rings, this extends to decorating inside the circle, creating a circle where half is empty and half is filled in with filigree), and a flat circle of gold applied to hide the end of the wire that goes through the nose. It is never made of silver, and women believe that the area of nose they pierce has fine blood vessels that would be harmed by silver. It is only worn by married women and is worn on the left. Traditionally the women of the region believe the nose ring, while worn, will prevent pains and headaches. 

In Sinai, the nose piercing is called the shenaf, and like much of the region&#x27;s jewelry, bears a resemblance to Palestinian examples. It is typically made of gold and sometimes will have colored beads worked into the design. Pieces that dangle from the main ring are common.
In Nubian Egypt and Sudan, the nose ring is called a &quot;zimam&quot;. The Rashayda call it by the same name and make it from 21 carat gold. The Bishariya also wear a nose ring- there is some overlap between the three groups jewelry, as they live in proximity and would buy jewelry from the same cities. The nose rings of the Rashayda have a similar shape to the small nose rings of Bahariya with a thickened decoration around the lower half, but do not employ filigree. Some nose rings in the region are similar to Lane&#x27;s drawing from 1836, being just a wire with some beads strung on it.

In Central Asia, nose piercings are called Arawak or Arabek and were introduced to the region during Arab conquests. Uzbek women traditionally wore nose piercing called Arawak as part of traditional attire. In Eastern Europe, some Nogai and Tatar women were also known to wear similar nose rings.

In South Asia, nose piercings were introduced as early as 10th century and by 15th century they were common across South Asia. Historian A.S Altekar suggests nose piercings does not find mention in Indian literature before 8th century and was likely introduced after this period. According to historian Benoytosh Bhattacharya the 12th century text Manasollasa mentions various ornaments worn by women but does not mention ornaments for nose, and was likely introduced by Mohammadans after the 12th century. Jewelry historian Oppi Utrecht suggests nose piercings were introduced during 13th century by Muslims and was quickly established over the years.

==Septum piercing==
The nasal septum is the cartilaginous dividing wall between the nostrils. Generally, the cartilage itself is not pierced, but rather the small gap between the cartilage and the bottom of the nose (sometimes called the &quot;sweet spot&quot; by piercers), typically at 16g (1.2 mm) although it is often stretched to a larger gauge (size). This piercing heals within a month and a half to three months also depending on the individual. It should only be stretched by 1mm at a time, and waiting at least a month between stretches is advisable. If a certain point is exceeded, usually about 8mm, the cartilage gets forced towards the top of the nose, which can be uncomfortable.

Many types of jewelry generally are worn in a septum piercing, such as: Captive bead rings (CBRs), rings that close with a bead held in the center by the tension of the ring, circular barbells (as shown in the picture), a circular bar with a bead that screws onto either end, a &quot;tusk&quot; that is a straight or shaped piece of material generally tapered on either end, or pinchers. For large gauge septums, many individuals choose to wear plugs, as the plugs do not weigh their noses down, which is helpful in healing. This measure allows the piercing not to be damaged by the sudden movement of the jewelry.

Another option is a septum retainer, which is staple-shaped. This type of nose piercing is particularly easy to hide when desired, for example to comply with a dress code. A septum retainer makes possible turning the jewelry up into the nose, thus concealing it. With black jewelry flipped up into the nostrils, this piercing can be made practically invisible. A circular barbell can also be hidden by pushing it to the back into the nose, but it may be uncomfortable.

In ancient Carthage, septum piercings were worn by both Carthaginian men and women. These were commonly made of gold, some examples in silver are also known.

Septum piercing is noted in several Native American peoples in history; the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, for example, had such piercings.

The septum piercing is popular in countryside of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In India such piercing is called the &#x27;Nathori&#x27; and &quot;Bulak&quot;. Septum piercing is also worn by Kuchipudi and Bharatnatyam dancers. Bengali women traditionally would wear the &quot;Nathori&quot; as a sign of being a married woman. The &quot;Nathori&quot; would be gold with a tear drop that would move along the ring. Many lower-class women in rural Bengal still keep this tradition. This practice is now declining as many women prefer the nose studs.

In hilly region of Nepal, the septum piercing is known as &quot;Bulaki&quot; and is worn by women of multiple ethnic groups. In Southern region of Nepal the septum piercing is still common. Many older women still adorn their noses with both the septum and left nostril rings. Many women have gold nose piercings to show their social, tribal, and religious status in society.

In Central Australia, nose piercing was central to the development of a boy to a man. The Arunta, an aboriginal tribe in Central Australia, rite of passage for a boy. The rite of passage began with dancing ceremonies and developed into the boy moving to the men&#x27;s camp and learning to hunt. The boys are usually between the ages of eleven and thirteen. The women at first throw the boy into the air and then is handed the men to throw him into the air to symbolize the boy belonging to the men from then on after. The boy learns to hunt larger animals that requires a tactful skill set that was not needed for smaller game. After some time, the boy&#x27;s nasal septum was pierced and inserted with a bone by his father or grandfather to flatten his nose according to aesthetics.

Likewise, girls&#x27; symbol of coming of age was a nose piercing, but was done by her husband after marriage. Culturally, the piercings signified the social status of the individual and their right to access other ceremonies. For women, it displayed their ability to acquire a husband. For the husband, it displayed his ownership and right to his wife. For men, it presented the boy now as a man and his place is society with men. He no longer belonged to the children and the women who raised him. In addition, he now had the right to ceremonies such as circumcision, subincision and an elevated position in society.

===Risks===
The septum or nasal septum is the cartilaginous wall that separates the two nostrils. The cartilage is generally not penetrated. It is the slim segment of extremely delicate and adaptable skin, just between the cartilage and the lower part of the nose, where the septum is generally pierced. Puncturing the skin rather than the cartilage can extraordinarily limit the aggravation, as well as different inconveniences related with this sort of piercing. This piercing ought to be done exclusively with a needle. Taking everything into account, captive bead rings, circular barbells, plugs, tusks, twists, and septum retainers can be utilized. Risk of bacterial contamination is additionally present in pools, waterways and showers.

All types of body piercings, including septum piercings, are associated with the risk of contracting certain blood borne diseases, like hepatitis, from the needles and piercing guns used in the procedure. This risk can be reduced by getting the piercing done by a reputable piercer and making sure that the piercer uses only sterile single-use needles. The next most common risk associated with almost all types of piercing is the risk of infection and pain. These issues can be minimized greatly if piercing is done on the soft and flexible skin that lies between the cartilage and bottom of the nose. As far as infection risks are concerned, they can be managed with proper piercing aftercare.

This piercing can sometimes lead to &#x27;septal hematoma&#x27; – an injury to the soft tissue within the septum that can disrupt the blood vessels to cause the accumulation of blood and fluid under the lining. Nasal septum hematoma can eventually cause nasal congestion and interfere with breathing along with causing pain and inflammation. If not treated immediately, the condition can ultimately cause formation of a hole in the septum, leading to nasal congestion. Sometimes, that part of the nose may collapse, resulting in a cosmetic deformity, known as &#x27;saddle nose&#x27;.

==Bridge piercing==
Bridge piercings are inserted through the skin at the top of the nose, between the eyes. Curved barbells and straight barbells are the most commonly used in this piercing, while seamless and captive rings are not recommended. Getting a bridge piercing done is somewhat riskier than other nose piercings. Like other surface piercings, the jewelry may migrate or cause scarring if not taken care of correctly. Bridge piercings require very specific anatomy, careful maintenance, and often many jewelry changes. A bridge piercing is pierced through the loose skin at the bridge of the nose. It is often pierced with a 14-gauge needle, depending on the preference of the piercer and the client&#x27;s anatomy.

Rhino Piercings

Rhino Piercings are inserted through the tip of the nose. This piercing gives the look of the horn on a rhinoceros. Rhino piercings are distinct from other nose piercings because they are placed through the tip of the nose instead of on the sides or middle of the nose. Due to the fact that this piercing is inserted through the nose&#x27;s cartilage, it can take up to a full year for the piercing to completely heal. The Rhino piercing is a usually safe procedure to perform as long as the nose is properly cleaned and sanitized.

<doc id="239034" wikidata="Q127548" url="?curid=239034" title="Dweezil Zappa">
<text>Dweezil Zappa (born Ian Donald Calvin Euclid Zappa; September 5, 1969) is an American rock guitarist and occasional actor. He is the son of musical composer and performer Frank Zappa. Exposed to the music industry from an early age, Zappa developed a strong affinity for playing the guitar and producing music. Able to learn directly from guitarists such as Steve Vai and Eddie Van Halen, Zappa released his first single (produced by Eddie Van Halen) at the age of 12.

In addition to writing and recording his own music, Zappa has carried on the legacy of his father&#x27;s music by touring with the group Zappa Plays Zappa. The band features renditions of Zappa&#x27;s original material and the lineup has often included Zappa alumni such as Napoleon Murphy Brock, Steve Vai, Terry Bozzio and others.

==Early life==
Dweezil Zappa was born on September 5, 1969, in Los Angeles, California, to Frank Zappa and Gail Zappa. He is the second of four siblings: his older sister, Moon, younger sister Diva and younger brother Ahmet, and is the cousin of actress Lala Sloatman. Zappa&#x27;s father was of Sicilian, Greek, Arab, and French descent, and his mother was of German and Portuguese ancestry.

Dweezil&#x27;s registered birth name was Ian Donald Calvin Euclid Zappa. The nurse at the hospital at which he was born refused to register him under the name Dweezil, to the point of arguing with Gail in the delivery room about it. Rattled at this turn of events, Frank rapidly listed the names of several musician friends, and the nurse added all of them to the birth certificate. &quot;Dweezil&quot; was a nickname coined by Frank for a funny-looking pinky toe of Gail&#x27;s. At the age of five years, Dweezil learned that his legal name was different, and he insisted on having his nickname become his legal name. Gail and Frank hired an attorney and soon the name Dweezil was official.

==Career==
In the 1980s, Zappa worked as an MTV VJ and was promptly fired after badmouthing MTV on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. He also recorded some solo albums, as well as playing for other artists. Zappa can be heard playing lead guitar on the Fat Boys&#x27; &quot;Wipe Out&quot; (1987) and can be seen in the music video for Don Johnson&#x27;s top 40 song, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. He also played co-lead guitar (along with Reb Beach) on Winger&#x27;s cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. He also had a part in the futuristic Arnold Schwarzenegger film &quot;The Running Man&quot; as Stevie (&quot;Don&#x27;t touch that dial!&quot;), and gave his most famous cameo role in John Hughes&#x27;s Brat Pack film, &quot;Pretty in Pink,&quot; as Andie&#x27;s friend, Simon.

Since the 1990s, Zappa has been working on a piece of music named &quot;What the Hell Was I Thinking?&quot;, a 75-minute piece featuring guitar solos by dozens of famous guitar players. The project has suffered from numerous difficulties and has been reworked several times since the &#x27;90s. Zappa said in September 2004: &quot;I started recording it on analog tape almost 13 years ago... There are probably about 35 guest guitar players on it, everybody from Brian May to Eddie Van Halen, Eric Johnson, Angus and Malcolm Young—it&#x27;s quite a crazy project. I&#x27;m still waiting and hoping to record Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page as some of my final guests on there.&quot;

For his 1991 album &quot;Confessions&quot;, Zappa recorded a cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; which featured vocals by Ozzy Osbourne. However, due to Osbourne&#x27;s label refusing to allow the feature, the vocals were re-recorded by Donny Osmond, who was signed to the same label as Zappa. The version with Osbourne&#x27;s vocals later appeared on Osbourne&#x27;s box set &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Zappa voiced the character Ajax Duckman on the animated series &quot;Duckman&quot;. He also briefly appeared in the television sitcom &quot;Normal Life&quot; with sister Moon Unit Zappa and former &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; star Cindy Williams. He composed and performed the theme music for &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; (the solo from Spinal Tap&#x27;s &quot;Break Like the Wind&quot;). In 1998, Zappa played music agent John Kaplan in the Warner Bros. family comedy &quot;Jack Frost&quot;. In 1999, Dweezil, alongside his brother, Ahmet Zappa, starred in a show featuring celebrities, bands and dance troupe called &quot;Happy Hour&quot; which debuted April 3, 1999, on the USA Network. The show lasted for one season despite its success due to a copyright dispute over the title of the show. To promote the show, he and Ahmet appeared briefly on the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s Rage Party, held the night prior to WrestleMania XV.
In &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s 2003 eleventh studio album &quot;Poodle Hat&quot;, Zappa performs the opening guitar solo and sings on the track, &quot;Genius in France&quot;. In 2006, Zappa organized the &quot;Zappa Plays Zappa&quot; tour. He assembled a band of young musicians with a view to bring the music of Frank Zappa to a younger audience. The tour also featured guest appearances by Steve Vai, Napoleon Murphy Brock and Terry Bozzio. The tour began in Europe in May with dates in the U.S. from June. After a break it continued in the U.S. on October 18, 2006. The 2007 version of the tour ran from July, finishing in Australia in early December, and featured Ray White as special guest. The shows ended with the promise: &quot;There are so many songs we want to learn to play ... see y&#x27;all next year...&quot;, and further tours have followed each year since 2007. In 2009, Ray White left Zappa Plays Zappa for an undisclosed reason.

Zappa lent his voice to one of the characters in one episode of &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; on Adult Swim.

In 2016, Zappa went on tour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of Frank Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; The tour was titled &quot;50 Years of Frank: Dweezil Zappa Plays Whatever the F@%k He Wants – The Cease and Desist Tour&quot;. The tour title was inspired by Zappa&#x27;s feud with his brother Ahmet over the use of the &quot;Zappa Plays Zappa&quot; moniker, which resulted in Ahmet sending Zappa a cease-and-desist letter through the family trust.
==Personal life==

In the 1980s, Zappa dated actresses Molly Ringwald and Demi Moore, and journalist Katie Wagner. 

From 1998 to 2004, Zappa dated musician Lisa Loeb. Zappa and Loeb wrote and performed music together, and Zappa toured with Loeb&#x27;s band. The couple co-hosted the cooking show &quot;Dweezil &amp; Lisa&quot; on Food Network in 2004.

Zappa married fashion stylist Lauren Knudsen on September 3, 2005, in Los Angeles. They have two daughters: Zola Frank Zappa (b. 2006) and Ceylon Indira Zappa (b. 2008). In March 2010 Knudsen filed for divorce in L.A. County Superior Court. According to the documents, she applied to share legal custody of their two daughters. In March 2012, with the divorce case still unresolved, Zappa&#x27;s former lawyer made a public issue of his unpaid legal bills.

Following the death of Zappa&#x27;s mother, Gail, in October 2015, it was revealed that his siblings Ahmet and Diva were given control of the Zappa Family Trust with shares of 30% each, while Dweezil and his sister Moon were given smaller shares of 20% each. As beneficiaries only, Moon and Dweezil will not receive any distributions from the trust until it is profitable—in 2016, it was &quot;millions of dollars in debt&quot;—and must seek permission from Ahmet, the trustee, to make money off of their father&#x27;s music or merchandise bearing his name. Dweezil received a cease and desist letter from the trust after he announced that he was being forced to perform his upcoming tour as &quot;Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa&quot; instead of using &quot;Zappa Plays Zappa&quot;. In response to the trust&#x27;s action, he renamed his performance series &quot;50 Years of Frank: Dweezil Zappa Plays Whatever the F@%k He Wants—the Cease and Desist Tour&quot;.

In May 2018, the four siblings announced that they had reconciled. But as of August 2024, Dweezil was no longer speaking with his siblings.

<doc id="239035" wikidata="Q815128" url="?curid=239035" title="Siege of Boston">
<text>The siege of Boston (April 19, 1775 – March 17, 1776) was the opening phase of the American Revolutionary War. In the siege, American patriot militia led by newly-installed Continental Army commander George Washington prevented the British Army, which was garrisoned in Boston, from moving by land. Both sides faced resource, supply, and personnel challenges during the siege. British resupply and reinforcement was limited to sea access, which was impeded by American vessels. The British ultimately abandoned Boston after eleven months, moving their troops and equipment north to Nova Scotia. 

The siege began on April 19 after the Revolutionary War&#x27;s first battles at Lexington and Concord, when Massachusetts militias blocked land access to Boston. The Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, formed the Continental Army from the militias involved in the fighting and appointed George Washington as commander in chief. In June 1775, the British seized Bunker Hill and Breed&#x27;s Hill, which Washington and the Continental Army was preparing to bombard, but their casualties were heavy and their gains insufficient to break the Continental Army&#x27;s control over land to Boston. After this, the Americans laid siege to Boston; no major battles were fought during this time, and the conflict was limited to occasional raids, minor skirmishes, and sniper fire. British efforts to supply their troops were significantly impeded by the smaller but more agile Continental Army and patriot forces that were operating on land and sea. The British suffered from a continual lack of food, fuel, and supplies.

In November 1775, George Washington sent Henry Knox on a mission to bring the heavy artillery that had recently been captured at Fort Ticonderoga. In a technically complex and demanding operation, Knox brought the cannons to Boston in January 1776, and this artillery fortified Dorchester Heights which overlooked Boston harbor. This development threatened to cut off the British supply lifeline from the sea. British commander William Howe saw his position as indefensible, and he withdrew his forces from Boston to Halifax, Nova Scotia on March 17.

==Background==


Before 1775, the British imposed taxes and import duties on the American colonies, to which the Americans objected since they lacked British Parliamentary representation. In response to the Boston Tea Party and other acts of protest, 4,000 British troops were sent to occupy Boston under the command of General Thomas Gage and to pacify the restive Province of Massachusetts Bay. Parliament authorized Gage to disband the government of Massachusetts Bay, led by John Hancock and Samuel Adams, among numerous other powers, but the Americans formed the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and continued to meet. The Provincial Congress called for the organization of local militias and coordinated the accumulation of weapons and other military supplies. Under the terms of the Boston Port Act, Gage closed the Boston port, which caused much unemployment and discontent.

British forces went to seize military supplies from the town of Concord on April 19, 1775, but militia companies from surrounding towns opposed them at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. At Concord, some of the British forces were routed in a confrontation at the North Bridge. The British troops were then engaged in a running battle during their march back to Boston, suffering heavy casualties. All of the New England colonies raised militias in response to this alarm and sent them to Boston.

==Siege==

Immediately after the battles of April 19, the Massachusetts militia formed a siege line extending from Chelsea, around the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown, to Roxbury, effectively surrounding Boston on three sides. The siege line was under the loose leadership of William Heath, who was superseded by General Artemas Ward late on April 20. They particularly blocked the Charlestown Neck, the only land access to Charlestown, and the Boston Neck, the only land access to Boston, which was then a peninsula, leaving the British in control only of the harbor and sea access.

The size of the colonial forces grew in the following days, as militias arrived from New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. General Gage wrote of his surprise at the number of Patriots surrounding the city: &quot;The rebels are not the despicable rabble too many have supposed them to be... In all their wars against the French they never showed such conduct, attention, and perseverance as they do now.&quot;

General Gage turned his attention to fortifying easily defensible positions. He ordered lines of defenses with ten 24-pound guns in Roxbury. In Boston proper, four hills were quickly fortified. They were to be the main defense of the city. Over time, each of these hills was strengthened. Gage also decided to abandon Charlestown, removing the beleaguered forces that had retreated from Concord. The town of Charlestown itself was entirely vacant, and Bunker Hill and Breed&#x27;s Hill were left undefended, as were the heights of Dorchester, which had a commanding view of the harbor and the city.

The British at first greatly restricted movement in and out of the city, fearing infiltration of weapons. Besieged and besiegers eventually reached an informal agreement allowing traffic on the Boston Neck, provided that no firearms were carried. Residents of Boston turned in almost 2,000 muskets, and most of the Patriot residents left the city. Many Loyalists who lived outside the city of Boston left their homes and fled into the city. Most of them felt that it was not safe to live outside of the city, because the Patriots were now in control of the countryside. Some of the men arriving in Boston joined Loyalist regiments attached to the British army.

The siege did not blockade the harbor and the city remained open for the Royal Navy to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the superiority of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant that the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information about what was happening in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of American activities.

===Early skirmishes===
On May 3, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized Benedict Arnold to raise forces for taking Fort Ticonderoga near the southern end of Lake Champlain in the Province of New York, which was known to have heavy weapons and only lightly defended. Arnold arrived in Castleton, New Hampshire on the 9th, where he joined with Ethan Allen and a militia company from Connecticut, all of whom had independently arrived at the idea of taking Ticonderoga. This company captured Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point under the joint leadership of Arnold and Allen. They also captured the one large military vessel on Lake Champlain in a raid on Fort Saint-Jean. They recovered more than 180 cannons and other weaponry and supplies that the Continental Army used to tighten their grip on Boston.
Boston lacked a regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered a party to go to Grape Island in the outer harbor and bring hay to Boston. The Continentals on the mainland noticed this and called out the militia. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the militia. The militia set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of hay and preventing the British from taking more than three tons.

Continental forces worked to clear the harbor islands of livestock and supplies useful to the British. The Royal Marines attempted to stop removal of livestock from some of the islands on May 27 in the Battle of Chelsea Creek. The Americans resisted and the British schooner &quot;Diana&quot; ran aground and was destroyed. Gage issued a proclamation on June 12 offering to pardon all of those who would lay down their arms, with the exception of John Hancock and Samuel Adams, but this merely ignited anger among the Patriots, and more people began to take up arms.

===Breed&#x27;s Hill===
The British had been receiving reinforcements throughout May until they reached a strength of about 6,000 men. On May 25, generals William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Henry Clinton arrived on , and Gage began planning to break out of the city.

The British plan was to fortify Bunker Hill and Dorchester Heights. They fixed the date for taking Dorchester Heights at June 18, but the colonists&#x27; committee of safety learned of the British plans on June 15. In response, they sent instructions to General Ward to fortify Bunker Hill and the heights of Charlestown, and he ordered Colonel William Prescott to do so. On the night of June 16, Prescott led 1,200 men over the Charlestown Neck and constructed fortifications on Bunker Hill and Breed&#x27;s Hill.

British forces under General Howe took the Charlestown peninsula on June 17 in the Battle of Bunker Hill. The British succeeded in their tactical objective of taking the high ground on the Charlestown peninsula, but they suffered significant losses with some 1,000 men killed or wounded, including 92 officers killed. The British losses were so heavy that there were no further direct attacks on American forces. The Americans lost the battle but had again stood against the British regulars with some success, as they successfully repelled two assaults on Breed&#x27;s Hill during the engagement.

===Stalemate===
General George Washington arrived at Cambridge on July 2. He set up his headquarters at the Benjamin Wadsworth House at Harvard College and took command of the newly formed Continental Army the following day. By this time, forces and supplies were arriving, including four independent companies of riflemen (not part of any state line) from Maryland and Virginia. Washington began the work of molding the militias into an army, appointing senior officers (the militias had typically elected their leaders), and introducing more organization and disciplinary measures.

Washington required officers of different ranks to wear differentiating apparel so that they might be distinguished from their underlings and superiors. On July 16, he moved his headquarters to the John Vassall House in Cambridge, that became well known as the home of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Toward the end of July, about 2,000 riflemen arrived in units raised in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia by Congressional mandate. The accuracy of the rifle was previously unknown in New England, and these forces were used to harass the besieged forces.
Washington also ordered the defenses to be improved, so the army dug trenches on Boston Neck and then extended toward Boston. However, these activities had little effect on the British occupation. The working parties were fired on from time to time, as were sentries guarding the works. The British pushed back an American advanced guard on July 30, and they burned a few houses in Roxbury. An American rifleman was killed on August 2, and the British hung his body by the neck. In retaliation, American riflemen marched to the lines and began to attack the British troops. They continued their sharpshooting all day, killing and wounding many of the British while losing only one Patriot.

On August 30, the British made a surprise breakout from Boston Neck, set fire to a tavern, and withdrew to their defenses. On the same night, 300 Americans attacked Lighthouse Island and burned the lighthouse, killing several British soldiers and capturing 23, with the loss of only one American. On another August night, Washington sent 1,200 men to dig entrenchments on a hill near the Charlestown Neck. Despite a British bombardment, the Americans successfully dug the trenches.

In early September, Washington began drawing up plans for two moves: to dispatch 1,000 men from Boston to invade Quebec, and to launch an attack on Boston. He felt that he could afford to send some troops to Quebec, as he had received intelligence from British deserters and American spies that the British had no intention of launching an attack from Boston until they were reinforced. On September 11, about 1,100 troops under the command of Benedict Arnold left for Quebec. Washington summoned a council of war and made a case for an amphibious assault on Boston by sending troops across Back Bay in flat-bottomed boats which could hold 50 men each. He believed that it would be extremely difficult to keep the men together when winter came. His war council unanimously rejected the plan, and the decision was not to attack &quot;for the present at least&quot;.
In early September, Washington authorized the appropriation and outfitting of local fishing vessels for intelligence-gathering and interdiction of supplies to the British. This activity was a precursor to the Continental Navy, which was established in the aftermath of the British Burning of Falmouth in Portland, Maine. The provincial assemblies of Connecticut and Rhode Island began arming ships and authorized privateering.

In early November, 400 British soldiers went to Lechmere&#x27;s Point on a raiding expedition to acquire some livestock. They made off with 10 head of cattle but lost two lives in the skirmish with colonial troops sent to defend the point. On November 29, colonial Captain John Manley commanding the schooner &quot;Lee&quot; captured one of the most valuable prizes of the siege: the British brigantine &quot;Nancy&quot; just outside Boston Harbor. She was carrying a large supply of ordnance and military stores intended for the British troops in Boston.

As winter approached, the Americans were so short of gunpowder that some of the soldiers were given spears instead of guns. Many of the American troops remained unpaid and many of their enlistments were set to expire at the end of the year. 

Howe had replaced Gage in October as commander of the British forces, and was faced with different problems. Firewood was so scarce that British soldiers resorted to cutting down trees and tearing down wooden buildings, including the Old North Meeting House. The city had become increasingly difficult because of winter storms and the rise in American privateers. An improvised American war fleet of about 12 converted merchant ships captured 55 British ships over the course of the winter. Many of the captured ships had been carrying food and supplies to the British troops. The British troops were so hungry that many were ready to desert as soon as they could, and scurvy and smallpox had broken out in the city. Washington&#x27;s army faced similar problems with smallpox, as soldiers from rural communities were exposed to the disease. He moved infected troops to a separate hospital, the only option available given the public stigma against inoculation.

Washington again proposed to assault Boston in October, but his officers thought it best to wait until the harbor had frozen over. In February, the water froze between Roxbury and Boston Common, and Washington thought that he would try an assault by rushing across the ice in spite of his shortage in powder; but his officers again advised against it. Washington&#x27;s desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and he knew that Howe could easily break the lines of his army in its present condition. He abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan of fortifying Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.

British major general, Henry Clinton, and a small fleet set sail for the Carolinas in mid-January with 1,500 men. Their objective was to join forces with additional troops arriving from Europe, and to take a port in the southern colonies for further military operations. In early February, a British raiding party crossed the ice and burned several farmhouses in Dorchester.

==End of the siege==

Between November 1775 and February 1776, Colonel Henry Knox and a team of engineers used sledges to retrieve 60 tons of heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga, bringing them across the frozen Hudson and Connecticut rivers in a difficult, complex operation. They arrived back at Cambridge on January 24, 1776.

===Fortification of Dorchester Heights===

Some of the Ticonderoga cannons were of a size and range not previously available to the Americans. They were placed in fortifications around the city, and the Americans began to bombard the city on the night of March 2, 1776, to which the British responded with cannonades of their own. The American guns under the direction of Colonel Knox continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4. The exchange of fire did little damage to either side, although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.

On March 5, Washington moved more of the Ticonderoga cannon and several thousand men overnight to occupy Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston. The ground was frozen, which made it impossible to dig trenches, so Rufus Putnam developed a plan to fortify the heights using defenses made of heavy timbers and fascines. These were prefabricated out of sight of the British and brought in overnight. General Howe is said to have exclaimed, &quot;My God, these fellows have done more work in one night than I could make my army do in three months.&quot; The British fleet was within range of the American guns on Dorchester Heights, putting it and the troops in the city at risk.

The immediate response of the British was a two-hour cannon barrage at the heights, which had no effect because the British guns could not reach the American guns. After the failure of the barrage, Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must be removed from the heights if they were to hold Boston. They planned an assault on the heights, but the attack never took place because of a storm, and the British elected instead to withdraw.

On March 8, some prominent Bostonians sent a letter to Washington, stating that the British would not destroy the town if they were allowed to depart unmolested. Washington formally rejected the letter, as it was not addressed to him by either name or title. However, the letter had the intended effect; when the evacuation began, there was no American fire to hinder the British departure. On March 9, the British saw movement on Nook&#x27;s Hill in Dorchester and opened a massive artillery barrage that lasted all night. It killed four men with one cannonball, but that was all the damage that was done. The next day, the colonists went out and collected the 700 cannonballs that had been fired at them.

===Evacuation===
On March 10, 1776, General Howe issued a proclamation ordering the inhabitants of Boston to give up all linen and woolen goods that could be used by the colonists to continue the war. Loyalist Crean Brush was authorized to receive these goods, in return for which he gave certificates that were effectively worthless. Over the next week, the British fleet sat in Boston harbor waiting for favorable winds, while Loyalists and British soldiers were loaded onto the ships. During this time, American naval vessels outside the harbor successfully captured several British supply ships.

On March 15, the wind became favorable for the British, but it turned against them before they could leave. On March 17, the wind once again turned favorable. The troops were authorized to burn the town if there were any disturbances while they were marching to their ships; they began to move out at 4:00 a.m. By 9:00 a.m., all ships were underway. The fleet departing from Boston included 120 ships, with more than 11,000 people on board. Of those, 9,906 were British troops, 667 were women, and 553 were children.

==Aftermath==
Once the British fleet sailed away, the Americans moved to reclaim Boston and Charlestown. At first, they thought that the British were still on Bunker Hill, but it turned out that the British had left dummies in place. Initially, Artemas Ward led a troop of men into Boston who had already been exposed to smallpox, out of fear that others might be exposed who had no resistance to the disease. More of the colonial army entered on March 20, 1776, once the risk of disease was judged to be low. Washington had not hindered the British departure from the city by land, but he did not make their escape easy from the outer harbor. He directed Captain Manley to harass the departing British fleet, in which he had some success, capturing the ship carrying Crean Brush and his plunder, among other prizes.

General Howe left in his wake a small contingent of vessels whose primary purpose was to intercept any arriving British vessels. They redirected numerous ships to Halifax that were carrying British troops originally destined for Boston. Some unsuspecting British troop ships landed in Boston, only to fall into American hands.

The British departure ended major military activities in the New England colonies. Washington feared that the British were going to attack New York City and so departed on April 4 with his army for Manhattan, beginning the New York and New Jersey campaign.

There are six units of the Army National Guard derived from American units that participated in the siege of Boston: 101st Eng Bn, 125th MP Co, 181st Inf, 182nd Inf, 197th FA, and 201st FA. There are 30 units in the U.S. Army with lineages that go back to the colonial era.

&quot;Had Sir William Howe fortified the hills round Boston, he could not have been disgracefully driven from it,&quot; wrote his replacement Sir Henry Clinton. General Howe was severely criticized in the British press and Parliament for his failures in the Boston campaign, but he remained in command for another two years for the New York and New Jersey campaign and the Philadelphia campaign. General Gage never received another combat command. General Burgoyne saw action in the Saratoga campaign, a disaster that resulted in the capture of Burgoyne and 7,500 troops under his command. General Clinton commanded the British forces in America for four years (1778–1782).

Many Massachusetts Loyalists left with the British when they evacuated Boston. Some went to England to rebuild lives there, and some returned to America after the war. Many went to Saint John, New Brunswick.

Following the siege, Boston ceased to be a military target but continued to be a focal point for revolutionary activities, with its port acting as an important point for fitting ships of war and privateers. Its leading citizens had important roles in the development of the United States. Boston and other area communities mark March 17 as Evacuation Day.

<doc id="239036" wikidata="Q1125266" url="?curid=239036" title="Confessions (Usher album)">
<text>Confessions is the fourth studio album by American singer Usher. It was released on March 23, 2004, by Arista Records. Recording sessions for the album took place from 2003 to 2004, with its production on the album being handled by his longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri, along with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Lil Jon, among others. Primarily an R&amp;B album, &quot;Confessions&quot; showcases Usher as a crooner through a mixture of ballads and up-tempos, incorporating musical genres of dance-pop, hip hop, and crunk. The album&#x27;s themes generated controversy about Usher&#x27;s personal relationships. However, the album&#x27;s primary producer Jermaine Dupri claimed the album reflects Dupri&#x27;s own personal story.

In the United States, the album sold 1.1 million copies in its first week. To boost sales amid threats of bootlegging, the special edition for the album was issued, in which includes the single, &quot;My Boo&quot; (a duet with Alicia Keys). &quot;Confessions&quot; earned Usher various awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, it is the second-best selling album of the 2000s decade in the United States, behind NSYNC&#x27;s &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;. With over eight million copies sold in 2004, the album was viewed as a sign of recovering album sales in the United States, following three years of decline. It was also exemplary of urban music&#x27;s commercial peak and dominance of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 2004. &quot;Confessions&quot; has been certified fourteen-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of 2006, the album has sold over 10.3 million copies in the US and over 15 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling R&amp;B album of the 21st century by a male artist. Usher would also promote it with the Truth Tour the same year as the album&#x27;s release, marking his first international tour. &quot;Confessionsconcept, production and Usher&#x27;s vocal delivery received acclaim since upon its release, and in 2020 the album was ranked number 432 on [[Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|&quot;Rolling Stone]]s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.

==Background and recording==
When he began recording &quot;Confessions&quot; in 2003, Usher claimed he did not want to work with any new producers. Production began between Usher and Jermaine Dupri, who produced his last two albums, &quot;My Way&quot; (1997) and &quot;8701&quot; (2001). In spite of his vision, Usher stated, &quot;With this album I chose some new producers who I figured would definitely allow me to really articulate myself in a different way ... Every album you gotta grow. You gotta look for something different.&quot; Dupri also invited his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox. The album features productions by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Just Blaze, Usher&#x27;s brother James Lackey, Dre and Vidal, among others.

When Usher felt that the album was completed, with forty recorded songs, he submitted the album to his record label, Arista. However, he and the company&#x27;s then-president, L. A. Reid, who listened to the record, thought something was missing in it. &quot;You know what, there&#x27;s like one or two more records that we just gotta get.&quot; Usher was displeased with the decision; he felt returning to the studio was the hardest part and needed to re-motivate himself. He went on recording a few more tracks with help from fellow Atlantans Lil Jon and Ludacris. Eventually, the team was able to produce songs like &quot;Red Light&quot; and &quot;Yeah!&quot;. He also recorded songs with P. Diddy and The Neptunes during one of those sessions, but those songs were not released.

==Composition==
One of Usher&#x27;s first steps in recording &quot;Confessions&quot; was deciding to reveal &quot;his own little secrets&quot;. Friend and former A&amp;R rep named Kawan &quot;KP&quot; Prather thought the album would let the public know Usher personally. Prather said, &quot;The music has never been the question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they&#x27;re there with you.&quot; Primarily because of the album&#x27;s personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album &quot;Confessions&quot; because he felt it is his most personal record to date: &quot;All of us have our Pandora&#x27;s boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I&#x27;ve got a lot to say. I&#x27;ve got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of.&quot; He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.

Several of the songs in this album were conceptually based on a situation. For instance, &quot;Burn&quot; was built around the winding down of Usher&#x27;s two-year relationship with Rozonda &quot;Chilli&quot; Thomas from American R&amp;B-Hip hop girl group TLC. Dupri and Cox were talking and felt that there was a song in it, and started writing. Similarly, with the title track &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;, they were conversing about an impregnated mistress, and its concept was written down. Usher recorded &quot;Confessions Part II&quot; during July 2003 recording sessions in New York City. When Usher sang the song&#x27;s lyrics, the theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri to create two parts; &quot;Confessions Part I&quot; and &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;. &quot;Confessions Part I&quot; can be heard at the beginning of the video for &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;.

===Music and style===

&quot;Confessions&quot; falls mainly in the R&amp;B genre. Usher commented that he chose to work with collaborators who know &quot;... how to interpret R&amp;B from a jazz standpoint, an old school throwback standpoint, a new school point, a traditional classic standpoint ...&quot; With producers and Usher set to produce such an album, however, other musical genres including hip hop were incorporated. While he wanted to do R&amp;B, Usher also wanted his fans to experience hip hop at the same time: &quot;I try to think outside the box.&quot; When Lil Jon came on the scene, crunk was introduced to the R&amp;B-centered album, specifically on the Sean Garrett-penned song &quot;Yeah!&quot;. Usher said, &quot;&#x27;Yeah!&#x27; could be called the first consciously styled &quot;crunk R&amp;B&quot; record.&quot; The album also includes various slow jams.

This record also introduces a new style for Usher, focusing on his voice and technique. Andre &quot;Dre&quot; Harris and Vidal Davis listened to &quot;8701&quot; and felt that &quot;Usher really needs to sing hard and let people know his vocal ability&quot;. With efforts focused on the record to demonstrate his vocal ability to listeners, songs such as &quot;Superstar&quot; and &quot;Follow Me&quot; exhibited Usher in a type of &quot;crooner mode&quot;. The ballad-oriented &quot;Burn&quot; also showcases his vocal aptitude. 

Usher credits Eminem with the album&#x27;s reputation of being transparent, and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony with the hip-hop sound of the album, stating in an interview with Sway: 

==Release==

&quot;Confessions&quot; was slated to be released on November 6, 2003. However, due to marketing issues, the scheduled date was moved to March 23 of the following year. With several songs recorded, Usher faced the challenge of determining the final track listing. Usher, Dupri, Reid, and then-A&amp;R rep Mark Pitts each had their favorites among the forty, but decided to choose those which &quot;came up consistently more&quot;. The collective was able to settle on fifteen of them, with two interludes completing the seventeen track list. Many songs were set aside for future use, including &quot;Red Light&quot; and a remix of &quot;Yeah!&quot;. Usher and Arista held advance listenings for the album, a few months before its actual release; he also appeared on TV guestings to promote &quot;Confessions&quot;.

With strategies to boost the album&#x27;s sales albeit threats of stealing music in the internet, Usher and his management readied a follow-up release of &quot;Confessions&quot; with an additional marketing blitz. The idea was considered &quot;musically driven&quot; after Zomba, who absorbed Arista, management was excited about &quot;My Boo&quot;, a song that was recorded for the original version of the album but failed to meet deadline. However, it actually began when American R&amp;B and soul singer Alicia Keys, who is featured on the track, &quot;brought in that the talk of repackaging started&quot;. With the inclusion of &quot;My Boo&quot;, they thought of the album as complete. While they knew of other artists releasing special editions of their albums, the label felt that &quot;Confessions&quot; had the edge because of its previous success and its physical changes, including new cover art, an expanded CD booklet, a pullout poster and a letter to fans from Usher. The new version includes &quot;My Boo&quot; and &quot;Red Light&quot;, which were leaked alongside other songs that did not appear in the album, and a remix of &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;, and &quot;Seduction&quot;; original tracks were also improved like the extended version of &quot;Confessions Part I&quot; and a rap added by American rapper Jadakiss in &quot;Throwback&quot;. The label itself treated the version a new album, with full media advertisements. The album was re-issued in October 2004, seven months after its initial release.

Another expanded edition of the album, commemorating its 20th anniversary, is scheduled for release on November 1, 2024.

===Marketing===
In selecting which single to release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies. With many potential lead singles that could fare well in music markets, they were choosing between &quot;Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot;. Even though &quot;Burn&quot; was just what the label was looking for, they believed that &quot;Yeah!&quot; would be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, they felt &quot;Burn&quot; also failed to meet their expectations: &quot;&#x27;Burn&#x27; being a great song is one thing, but it&#x27;s one of them things where people said, &#x27;It&#x27;s strong, but can we make history with that?&#x27; At the end of the day, you want an event.&quot;

Usher was skeptical about whether &quot;Yeah!&quot;—which is largely composed around crunk—would be a good choice, given his mindset envisioning &quot;Confessions&quot; as an R&amp;B record. KP recalled, &quot;Everybody was scared to make that first step.&quot;

With much debate between two songs, &quot;Burn&quot; was originally chosen as the lead single, with plans of filming its music video in late 2003. Meanwhile, Lil Jon leaked &quot;Yeah!&quot; to DJs across the United States in November 2003. Originally, the label did not intend &quot;Yeah!&quot; as a proper single. Released to street DJs and mixtapes, it was meant to cultivate fans who waited for three years since the release of &quot;8701&quot;. While record labels stayed idle during the Christmas season, &quot;Yeah!&quot; was getting favorable and quick response from radio stations though nobody was promoting; it was finally released as the lead single.

To keep the album atop the chart, &quot;My Boo&quot; was targeted for release after &quot;Confessions Part II&quot; was diminishing on the Hot 100. The B-side of the UK release includes &quot;Red Light&quot; and &quot;Sweet Lies&quot;. The single again topped the Hot 100, giving the album its fourth consecutive number-one. &quot;Caught Up&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fifth and final single, and reached number eight in the United States.

===Tour===
Usher supported the album with a two-month concert tour called &quot;The Truth Tour&quot;. The tour set featured a small stage up on top of the main stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it—which lowered to the main stage—and had two big staircases on both sides of it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West, who had finished his own headlining tour for his 2004 album &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, was the opening act for &quot;The Truth Tour&quot;.

Preceding Usher&#x27;s entrance was a short movie showing him getting dressed, following on with him performing the opening song &quot;Caught Up&quot;, with Usher dressed in all white. The second song performed was &quot;You Make Me Wanna...&quot;, where two dancers stayed on the top stage with Usher while two male dancers came out to the lower level with two chairs each in their hands. Each dancer threw one chair up to the top, with Usher already in hand with his own chair, with everyone following a set dance routine. Following this, Usher performed &quot;U Remind Me&quot;, where he danced by himself during a breakdown of the track. He then sang &quot;That&#x27;s What It&#x27;s Made For&quot;, following on with the song &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, where Usher was dressed up in a lavender suit and came out in a chrome chair. During the song, Usher picked out a female from the crowd, transitioning to &quot;Superstar&quot;, singing to the fan. Usher continued singing to the fan, performing &quot;Can U Handle It?&quot;, closing the song by kissing the fan who then left the stage. Usher closed his performance with &quot;Confessions&quot;″ lead single &quot;Yeah!&quot;.

The American leg of the tour commenced on August 5, 2004, in Hampton, Virginia and concluded on October 7, 2004, in New York. It was ranked as one of the highest-grossing tours of 2004, grossing $29.1 million.

== Public reaction ==
After Usher and his label held a few listening parties for the album, controversies spread about the mistress-impregnating concept of &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;. Although Usher did not foresee such a reaction to the album, Dupri already guessed, while making the album, what the public&#x27;s reaction would be: &quot;People are gonna question [Usher] on a couple of little lyrics ...&quot; Coincidentally, Usher ended his relationship with Chilli early in 2004. People speculated about their breakup given the content of the album and Usher&#x27;s early interviews about its themes. With lyrics Usher admitted to have written because of his guilty conscience, people assumed that he and Chilli broke up because he was unfaithful. In a February 2004 radio interview, Chilli claimed that Usher &quot;cheated&quot; on her, and that caused their relationship to split.

Amidst widespread rumors, Usher stated, &quot;People assume things, because as I said, I pull from my personal experiences to make my music.&quot; He added that he loved Chilli, however, &quot;... it just didn&#x27;t work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash ...&quot; Although &quot;Burn&quot; is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: &quot;... it&#x27;s just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it.&quot; In early 2006, Dupri revealed that the story behind the album is his: &quot;... me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Confessions&quot; was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews.

Matt Cibula of PopMatters wrote that it &quot;might be the best English-language pop album of the year&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Jem Aswad said that Usher &quot;reveals his new-found maturity by opening with the grittiest song he&#x27;s ever done.&quot; Laura Checkoway of &quot;Vibe&quot; said that, &quot;Though &quot;Confessions&quot; doesn&#x27;t bring Usher all the way to the artistic maturity one might hope for, tracking this star&#x27;s progression definitely has its satisfactions.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine observed &quot;addictive R&amp;B hooks and all-dancin&#x27;, all-lovin&#x27; subject matter boosted with hot production tweaks.&quot; Amy Linden of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; commented that &quot;Usher&#x27;s (alleged) character flaws are easily forgiven, though, because he can sing his cheating ass off,&quot; and concluded, &quot;Like 2002&#x27;s big-selling but underrated &quot;8701&quot;, &quot;Confessions&quot; is a top-of-the-line pop-soul showcase that ... manages to be commercially savvy without coming off as too desperate. Sorta like Usher himself.&quot; Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that near the end, the songwriting &quot;fails&quot; Usher on a &quot;heavily front-loaded&quot; R&amp;B album, but felt that his performance is solid throughout:

In a mixed review, Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized its &quot;production gloss&quot; and said that, although Usher&#x27;s &quot;fluid delivery&quot; redeems weak tracks, there are only two &quot;great songs&quot;—&quot;Yeah!&quot; and the title track—and &quot;17 less so.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Laura Sinagra said that he &quot;is coming of age, again&quot;, but &quot;still doesn&#x27;t quite cut it as a horny roughneck&quot;. Jon Caramanica of &quot;Blender&quot; viewed that Usher&#x27;s songwriting &quot;isn&#x27;t a strength, and his ballads often drown in their own inanity&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Elizabeth Mendez Berry called &quot;Confessions&quot; &quot;Usher&#x27;s strongest recording to date&quot; but found the more sexual songs mundane. Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; cited &quot;Confessions Part II&quot; and &quot;Bad Girl&quot; as &quot;choice cuts&quot;, indicating &quot;a good song on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money&quot;.

=== Accolades ===

The album earned Usher numerous accolades. At the 47th Grammy Awards, he was nominated for eight categories and won three: Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album, Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (for &quot;My Boo&quot;) and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (for &quot;Yeah!&quot;). Usher won awards at the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards: R&amp;B/Soul Album, Male (for &quot;Confessions&quot;); R&amp;B/Soul Single, Male for (&quot;Confessions Part II&quot;); R&amp;B/Soul Single, Group, Band or Duo (for &quot;My Boo&quot;); and R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Dance Cut (for &quot;Yeah!&quot;). At the 2004 American Music Awards, he won four, including Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album and Favorite Male Soul/R&amp;B Artist. At the 2004 Billboard Music Awards, Usher racked up eleven awards, more than any other artist in one night at the time. These include Artist of the Year, Male Artist of the Year, and Hot 100 Song of the Year for &quot;Yeah!&quot;. In December 2009 it was ranked as the best solo album and second best overall album of the 2000–2009 decade. Its singles &quot;Yeah!&quot;, &quot;Burn, and &quot;My Boo&quot; were all ranked as some of the best songs of the 2000–2009 decade, respectively placing in order at number two, number 21, and number 36.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Confessions&quot; was commercially successful, selling 1.096 million copies in the United States in its first week of release. It became the highest-ever first week sales by an R&amp;B artist, the second-highest first week sales for a male artist, and the seventh-highest first week sales of the recorded album charts history by SoundScan at the time of its release. It also equates the combined first-week sales of his four previous album releases, including his live album called &quot;Live&quot;. The feat also carved history in Arista records having the first in any of their released albums to reach such sales. The success of the thirty-year-old record label, however, was attributed to its merging with Zomba Records. As of March 2013 it has the tenth highest first week album sales in history.

The album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Usher&#x27;s first number-one album. &quot;Confessions&quot; also hit number-one on the Canadian Albums Chart and the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Its early, and successive, progress on the chart was said to be partly sustained by its strong single releases and plenty of press appearances and promotions. With &quot;Yeah!&quot; propelling the album&#x27;s debut atop the chart, &quot;Burn&quot;, the second single off the album, facilitated &quot;Confessions&quot; continuing dominance as well. The first two released singles were competing on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; the latter ended the twelve-week number-one chart run of the former. As the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;, was about to top the chart and Usher to join with English pop and rock group The Beatles as the only acts to achieve three consecutive number-one singles, American R&amp;B singer Fantasia Barrino&#x27;s debut single &quot;I Believe&quot; prevented it from happening. Despite this, Usher became the first artist to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay with three consecutive number-one singles. &quot;Burn&quot; achieved only eight non-consecutive weeks on the Hot 100 after &quot;Confessions Part II&quot; topped the chart; it became Usher&#x27;s second time to replace his own single at the top. &quot;Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot; were 2004&#x27;s top best-selling singles in the United States, placing at number one and two respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart Year-Ender. Again, it honored Usher being the first act to achieve the feat since 1964 with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot;.

The album continued its dominance on the chart. &quot;D12 World&quot; by D12 ended its five consecutive weeks run at the top spot; however, &quot;Confessions&quot; reclaimed the position the following week. The album spent a total 9 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the longest-running number one album of the millennium until 2009, when country singer Taylor Swift spent 11 weeks atop the charts with &quot;Fearless&quot;. Over one month after its release, &quot;Confessions&quot; was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for three million US shipments. &quot;Confessions&quot; topped the list of the most-shipped albums of 2004 in the United States and was the best selling album of the year with 7,978,594 copies sold. &quot;Confessions&quot; was the sixth best-selling album of the 2000s decade in the US. In February 2024, it reached 14 million shipments in the US, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.&quot;Confessions&quot; sold over 15 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album by a Black artist in the 21st century.

==Legacy==
=== Music industry ===

With sales of nearly eight million in 2004, &quot;Confessions&quot; was the most-shipped album of the year in the US. Along with the success of the American singer Norah Jones&#x27;s second album, &quot;Feels like Home&quot; (2004), as well as breakthroughs albums by many new and old artists, it was seen as a sign that US record sales were slowly recovering after three straight years of decline due to competing DVDs and video games and the prevalent music piracy. By the end of 2004, the industry had sold 667 million albums, an increase of about 1.6 percent, as recorded by Nielsen SoundScan. Compared with sales records in 2003, the figures showed eight percent increase. The album&#x27;s success also exemplified urban music&#x27;s commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts by R&amp;B and hip hop artists. In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 were by African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&amp;B hits that year. Along with Usher&#x27;s streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&amp;B charts were topped by OutKast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot;, Terror Squad&#x27;s &quot;Lean Back&quot;, and Ciara&#x27;s &quot;Goodies&quot;. Chris Molanphy of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; later remarked that &quot;by the early 2000s, urban music &quot;was&quot; pop music.&quot;

In a year-end article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writer Ben Sisario dubbed 2004 &quot;the year of Usher&quot;. The success of the album put Usher in the mainstream, becoming the biggest artist of 2004. Others also said that Usher might be the successor of Michael Jackson. Uproxx says &quot;Confessions&quot; &quot;has gone on to establish itself as one of the landmark albums in pop culture&quot;, describing it as &quot;an irreplaceable pillar in R&amp;B lore&quot;. According to Vibe magazine, the album is credited for having &quot;birthed&quot; many contemporary albums such as Adele&#x27;s &quot;21&quot;, Miguel&#x27;s &quot;Kaleidoscope Dream&quot;, Drake&#x27;s &quot;So Far Gone&quot;, Omarion&#x27;s &quot;O&quot;, Jason Derulo&#x27;s self-titled debut and others.

Bryan-Michael Cox, who co-wrote and co-produced &quot;Burn&quot;, earned credibility in the music industry for his role in the album. Cox had been producing records for several American artists, including Alicia Keys, B2K, Mariah Carey and Destiny&#x27;s Child, among others, but he considered &quot;Burn&quot; as his crowning moment, which earned him two Grammy Award nominations. With 2004 deemed to be his introduction to a larger, more mainstream audience, Cox stated in an interview for MTV that many people were starting to recount what he had done. A songwriter was awarded $44 million in a lawsuit involving a song from Usher&#x27;s diamond-certified album &quot;Confessions&quot; after a jury sided with Daniel Marino in a claim that his &quot;Club Girl&quot; became Usher&#x27;s hit &quot;Bad Girl&quot;

&quot;Confessions&quot; ranked 2nd best album of the 2000s on the &quot;Billboard Top 200 Albums of the Decade&quot; 2000s list, higher than any other solo album. The album is also ranked as the 16th best album on the &quot;Billboard Top 200 Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2020, the album was ranked number 432 on the &quot;Top 500 Albums of All-Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. With global sales exceeding 15 million, &quot;Confessions&quot; is the best-selling album by a black artist in the 21st century. &quot;Confessions&quot; makes Usher the only male solo R&amp;B artist to sell 10 million copies of a single album in the United States during the Soundscan era and the first of only two black artists to reach this mark since the year 2000. (The other black artist being American rapper Nelly with his debut album &quot;Country Grammar&quot;.) After &quot;Confessions&quot; was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of 10 million copies in the US, no new album was certified diamond until Adele&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;21&quot; reached diamond-status, the longest between any two new diamond albums since the inception of the association.

=== Pop culture ===
In 2020, music industry magazine &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27; ranked Usher the &quot;Greatest Pop Star of 2004&quot;. Referring to a 2008 article from MTV, writer Shaheem Reid declared that &quot;with Confessions, Usher has made the Big Connection [...]. That connection our parents felt when Marvin Gaye sang on the &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; album.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; pointed out how most of the secrets revealed and storytelling in the album was inspired by Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s situation, but they also noted Usher&#x27;s marketing and &quot;dalliances outside of his public relationship with TLC&#x27;s Chilli that provided the material for &quot;Confessions&quot;.&quot; The writer praised Usher&#x27;s commercial power during the &quot;Confessions&quot; era, as he would influence future pop stars: &quot;Even if you didn&#x27;t listen to R&amp;B, you knew this album. And if you did listen to R&amp;B, this was the blueprint for all your favorite stars to come: Drake, Justin Bieber, Miguel, Chris Brown and Omarion have all cited Usher&#x27;s influence. And though Beyoncé spoke about &quot;Thriller&quot; as the touchstone for her career-defining self-titled release in 2013, the way the lyrics tease revelations about her personal life with her husband, both good and bad, feels more indebted to &quot;Confessions&quot; than anything Michael Jackson wrote.&quot;

15 years after the album was released, A. Harmony of &quot;Bustle&quot; wrote it was &quot;the catalyst that propelled him to superstardom&quot; and &quot;forever changed the landscape of music&quot;. Harmony noted the album&#x27;s impact on R&amp;B and pop music with the success of &quot;Yeah!&quot; leading &quot;countless R&amp;B stars, from Ciara to T-Pain, to launch careers on the foundation of Crunk&amp;B&quot;. Te writer also noted the album&#x27;s influence on trap music and future generations of R&amp;B and hip-hop artists. Think of trap soul as Crunk&amp;B&#x27;s mellowed, more subdued successor. Like crunk, it&#x27;s punchy and heavily steeped in hip-hop influences. But like Usher&#x27;s take on songs like &quot;Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Follow Me,&quot; trap soul has contoured edges and smoother textures. From 6LACK&#x27;s acerbic laments on love to H.E.R.&#x27;s dark, smoky vocals, current trends in R&amp;B can be traced back to Usher&#x27;s techniques. In this regard, Usher&#x27;s mark on R&amp;B is indelible; he not only inspired countless artists in the early 2000s, but also charted a course for today&#x27;s stars. Harmony also pointed out the album&#x27;s influence on the music industry and pop culture as a whole, as &quot;Confessions&quot; changed how albums are marketed and &quot;proved that gossip can sell records&quot;. Later albums such as Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Lemonade&quot;, which was fueled by infidelity and divorce rumors with her rapper husband Jay-Z, relationship rumors around Janelle Monáe&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Computer&quot;, and Ariana Grande&#x27;s &quot;Thank U, Next&quot; coming off the heels of her public break up with comedian Pete Davidson were used as examples of how Usher&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; brought &quot;the relationship between the gossip pages and the album charts... stronger than before&quot;.

<text>Construction is a general term meaning the art and science of forming objects, systems, or organizations. It comes from the Latin word &quot;constructio&quot; (from &quot;com-&quot; &quot;together&quot; and &quot;struere&quot; &quot;to pile up&quot;) and Old French &quot;construction&quot;. To &#x27;construct&#x27; is a verb: the act of building, and the noun is construction: how something is built or the nature of its structure.

In its most widely used context, construction covers the processes involved in delivering buildings, infrastructure, industrial facilities, and associated activities through to the end of their life. It typically starts with planning, financing, and design that continues until the asset is built and ready for use. Construction also covers repairs and maintenance work, any works to expand, extend and improve the asset, and its eventual demolition, dismantling or ing.

The construction industry contributes significantly to many countries&#x27; gross domestic products (GDP). Global expenditure on construction activities was about $4 trillion in 2012. In 2022, expenditure on the construction industry exceeded $11 trillion a year, equivalent to about 13 percent of global GDP. This spending was forecasted to rise to around $14.8 trillion in 2030.

The construction industry promotes economic development and brings many non-monetary benefits to many countries, but it is one of the most hazardous industries. For example, about 20% (1,061) of US industry fatalities in 2019 happened in construction.

==History==

The first huts and shelters were constructed by hand or with simple tools. As cities grew during the Bronze Age, a class of professional craftsmen, like bricklayers and carpenters, appeared. Occasionally, slaves were used for construction work. In the Middle Ages, the artisan craftsmen were organized into guilds. In the 19th century, steam-powered machinery appeared, and later, diesel- and electric-powered vehicles such as cranes, excavators and bulldozers.

Fast-track construction has been increasingly popular in the 21st century. Some estimates suggest that 40% of construction projects are now fast-track construction.

==Construction industry sectors==

Broadly, there are three sectors of construction: buildings, infrastructure and industrial:
* Building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential.
* Infrastructure, also called &#x27;heavy civil&#x27; or &#x27;heavy engineering&#x27;, includes large public works, dams, bridges, highways, railways, water or wastewater and utility distribution.
* Industrial construction includes offshore construction (mainly of energy installations), mining and quarrying, refineries, chemical processing, mills and manufacturing plants.

The industry can also be classified into sectors or markets. For example, &quot;Engineering News-Record&quot; (&quot;ENR&quot;), a US-based construction trade magazine, has compiled and reported data about the size of design and construction contractors. In 2014, it split the data into nine market segments: transportation, petroleum, buildings, power, industrial, water, manufacturing, sewage/waste, telecom, hazardous waste, and a tenth category for other projects. &quot;ENR&quot; used data on transportation, sewage, hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors.

The Standard Industrial Classification and the newer North American Industry Classification System classify companies that perform or engage in construction into three subsectors: building construction, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. There are also categories for professional services firms (e.g., engineering, architecture, surveying, project management).

===Building construction===
Building construction is the process of adding structures to areas of land, also known as real property sites. Typically, a project is instigated by or with the owner of the property (who may be an individual or an organisation); occasionally, land may be compulsorily purchased from the owner for public use.

====Residential construction====
Residential construction may be undertaken by individual land-owners (self-built), by specialist housebuilders, by property developers, by general contractors, or by providers of public or social housing (e.g.: local authorities, housing associations). Where local zoning or planning policies allow, mixed-use developments may comprise both residential and non-residential construction (e.g.: retail, leisure, offices, public buildings, etc.).

Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to local building authority&#x27;s regulations and codes of practice. Materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used (e.g.: brick versus stone versus timber). Costs of construction on a per square meter (or per square foot) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions, access routes, local regulations, economies of scale (custom-designed homes are often more expensive to build) and the availability of skilled tradespeople.

====Non-residential construction====

Depending upon the type of building, non-residential building construction can be procured by a wide range of private and public organisations, including local authorities, educational and religious bodies, transport undertakings, retailers, hoteliers, property developers, financial institutions and other private companies. Most construction in these sectors is undertaken by general contractors.

===Infrastructure construction===
Civil engineering covers the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, tunnels, airports, water and sewerage systems, pipelines, and railways. Some general contractors have expertise in civil engineering; civil engineering contractors are firms dedicated to work in this sector, and may specialise in particular types of infrastructure.

===Industrial construction===

Industrial construction includes offshore construction (mainly of energy installations: oil and gas platforms, wind power), mining and quarrying, refineries, breweries, distilleries and other processing plants, power stations, steel mills, warehouses and factories.

==Construction processes==
Some construction projects are small renovations or repair jobs, like repainting or fixing leaks, where the owner may act as designer, paymaster and laborer for the entire project. However, more complex or ambitious projects usually require additional multi-disciplinary expertise and manpower, so the owner may commission one or more specialist businesses to undertake detailed planning, design, construction and handover of the work. Often the owner will appoint one business to oversee the project (this may be a designer, a contractor, a construction manager, or other advisors); such specialists are normally appointed for their expertise in project delivery and construction management and will help the owner define the project brief, agree on a budget and schedule, liaise with relevant public authorities, and procure materials and the services of other specialists (the supply chain, comprising subcontractors and materials suppliers). Contracts are agreed for the delivery of services by all businesses, alongside other detailed plans aimed at ensuring legal, timely, on-budget and safe delivery of the specified works.

Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use. The financial structure must be adequate to build the design provided and must pay amounts that are legally owed. Legal structures integrate design with other activities and enforce financial and other construction processes.

These processes also affect procurement strategies. Clients may, for example, appoint a business to design the project, after which a competitive process is undertaken to appoint a lead contractor to construct the asset (design–bid–build); they may appoint a business to lead both design and construction (design-build); or they may directly appoint a designer, contractor and specialist subcontractors (construction management). Some forms of procurement emphasize collaborative relationships (partnering, alliancing) between the client, the contractor, and other stakeholders within a construction project, seeking to ameliorate often highly competitive and adversarial industry practices. DfMA (design for manufacture and assembly) approaches also emphasize early collaboration with manufacturers and suppliers regarding products and components.

Construction or refurbishment work in a &quot;live&quot; environment (where residents or businesses remain living in or operating on the site) requires particular care, planning and communication.

===Planning===
When applicable, a proposed construction project must comply with local land-use planning policies including zoning and building code requirements. A project will normally be assessed (by the &#x27;authority having jurisdiction&#x27;, AHJ, typically the municipality where the project will be located) for its potential impacts on neighbouring properties, and upon existing infrastructure (transportation, social infrastructure, and utilities including water supply, sewerage, electricity, telecommunications, etc.). Data may be gathered through site analysis, site surveys and geotechnical investigations. Construction normally cannot start until planning permission has been granted, and may require preparatory work to ensure relevant infrastructure has been upgraded before building work can commence. Preparatory works will also include surveys of existing utility lines to avoid damage-causing outages and other hazardous situations.

Some legal requirements come from &quot;malum in se&quot; considerations, or the desire to prevent indisputably bad phenomena, e.g. explosions or bridge collapses. Other legal requirements come from &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; considerations, or factors that are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses from a business district or residences from a residential district. An attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built, either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable (the bridge design will not cause a collapse), or that the custom is no longer needed (acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community).

During the construction of a building, a municipal building inspector usually inspects the ongoing work periodically to ensure that construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code. Once construction is complete, any later changes made to a building or other asset that affect safety, including its use, expansion, structural integrity, and fire protection, usually require municipality approval.

===Finance===
Depending on the type of project, mortgage bankers, accountants, and cost engineers may participate in creating an overall plan for the financial management of a construction project. The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely, even in relatively small projects since the owner&#x27;s equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project. Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process. Professionals including cost engineers, estimators and quantity surveyors apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation.

Financial planning ensures adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started, and ensures that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project. Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems. Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project. Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials; such problems may arise even when the overall budget is adequate, presenting a temporary issue. Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid. Fraud is also an issue of growing significance within construction.

Large projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with a conceptual cost estimate performed by a building estimator. As portions of a project are completed, they may be sold, supplanting one lender or owner for another, while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and materials available for each stage of the building construction project carry forward. Public–private partnerships (PPPs) or private finance initiatives (PFIs) may also be used to help deliver major projects. According to McKinsey in 2019, the &quot;vast majority of large construction projects go over budget and take 20% longer than expected&quot;.

===Legal===

A construction project is a complex net of construction contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, and provides structures to manage issues. For example, construction delays can be costly, so construction contracts set out clear expectations and clear paths to manage delays. Poorly drafted contracts can lead to confusion and costly disputes.

At the start of a project, legal advisors seek to identify ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structures, and to present options for preventing problems. During projects, they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise. In each case, the lawyer facilitates an exchange of obligations that matches the reality of the project.

===Procurement===
====Traditional or Design-bid-build====
Design-bid-build is the most common and well-established method of construction procurement. In this arrangement, the architect, engineer or builder acts for the client as the project coordinator. They design the works, prepare specifications and design deliverables (models, drawings, etc.), administer the contract, tender the works, and manage the works from inception to completion. In parallel, there are direct contractual links between the client and the main contractor, who, in turn, has direct contractual relationships with subcontractors. The arrangement continues until the project is ready for handover.

====Design-build====

Design-build became more common from the late 20th century, and involves the client contracting a single entity to provide design and construction. In some cases, the design-build package can also include finding the site, arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory consents. Typically, the client invites several Design &amp; Build (D&amp;B) contractors to submit proposals to meet the project brief and then selects a preferred supplier. Often this will be a consortium involving a design firm and a contractor (sometimes more than one of each). In the United States, departments of transportation usually use design-build contracts as a way of progressing projects where states lack the skills or resources, particularly for very large projects.

====Construction management====

In a construction management arrangement, the client enters into separate contracts with the designer (architect or engineer), a construction manager, and individual trade contractors. The client takes on the contractual role, while the construction or project manager provides the active role of managing the separate trade contracts, and ensuring that they complete all work smoothly and effectively together. This approach is often used to speed up procurement processes, to allow the client greater flexibility in design variation throughout the contract, to enable the appointment of individual work contractors, to separate contractual responsibility on each individual throughout the contract, and to provide greater client control.

===Design===
In the industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality. Most commonly (i.e.: in a design-bid-build project), the design team is employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Depending upon the type of project, a design team may include architects, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural engineers, fire protection engineers, planning consultants, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. A &#x27;lead designer&#x27; will normally be identified to help coordinate different disciplinary inputs to the overall design. This may be aided by integration of previously separate disciplines (often undertaken by separate firms) into multi-disciplinary firms with experts from all related fields, or by firms establishing relationships to support design-build processes.

The increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained in all phases of a project&#x27;s life-cycle and develop an appreciation of the asset as an advanced technological system requiring close integration of many sub-systems and their individual components, including sustainability. For buildings, building engineering is an emerging discipline that attempts to meet this new challenge.

Traditionally, design has involved the production of sketches, architectural and engineering drawings, and specifications. Until the late 20th century, drawings were largely hand-drafted; adoption of computer-aided design (CAD) technologies then improved design productivity, while the 21st-century introduction of building information modeling (BIM) processes has involved the use of computer-generated models that can be used in their own right or to generate drawings and other visualisations as well as capturing non-geometric data about building components and systems.

On some projects, work on-site will not start until design work is largely complete; on others, some design work may be undertaken concurrently with the early stages of on-site activity (for example, work on a building&#x27;s foundations may commence while designers are still working on the detailed designs of the building&#x27;s internal spaces). Some projects may include elements that are designed for off-site construction (see also prefabrication and modular building) and are then delivered to the site ready for erection, installation or assembly.

===On-site construction===

Once contractors and other relevant professionals have been appointed and designs are sufficiently advanced, work may commence on the project site. Some projects require preliminary works, such as land preparation and levelling, demolition of existing structures (see below), or laying foundations, and there are circumstances where this work may be contracted for in advance of finalising the contract and costs for the whole project.

Typically, a construction site will include a secure perimeter to restrict unauthorised access, site access control points, office and welfare accommodation for personnel from the main contractor and other firms involved in the project team, and storage areas for materials, machinery and equipment. According to the &quot;McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Architecture and Construction&#x27;s&quot; definition, construction may be said to have &quot;started&quot; when the first feature of the permanent structure has been put in place, such as pile driving, or the pouring of slabs or footings.

===Commissioning and handover===

Commissioning is the process of verifying that all subsystems of a new building (or other assets) work as intended to achieve the owner&#x27;s project requirements and as designed by the project&#x27;s architects and engineers.

===Defects liability period===
A period after handover (or practical completion) during which the owner may identify any shortcomings in relation to the building specification (&#x27;defects&#x27;), with a view to the contractor correcting the defect.

===Maintenance, repair and improvement===

Maintenance involves functional checks, servicing, repairing or replacing of necessary devices, equipment, machinery, building infrastructure, and supporting utilities in industrial, business, governmental, and residential installations.

===Demolition===

Demolition is the discipline of safely and efficiently tearing down buildings and other artificial structures. Demolition contrasts with deconstruction, which involves taking a building apart while carefully preserving valuable elements for reuse purposes (recycling – see also circular economy).

==Industry scale and characteristics==
===Economic activity===

The output of the global construction industry was worth an estimated $10.8 trillion in 2017, and in 2018 was forecast to rise to $12.9 trillion by 2022, and to around $14.8 trillion in 2030. As a sector, construction accounts for more than 10% of global GDP (in developed countries, construction comprises 6–9% of GDP), and employs around 7% of the total employed workforce around the globe (accounting for over 273 million full- and part-time jobs in 2014). Since 2010, China has been the world&#x27;s largest single construction market. The United States is the second largest construction market with a 2018 output of $1.581 trillion.

* In the United States in February 2020, around $1.4 trillion worth of construction work was in progress, according to the Census Bureau, of which just over $1.0 trillion was for the private sector (split roughly 55:45% between residential and nonresidential); the remainder was public sector, predominantly for state and local government.
* In Armenia, the construction sector experienced growth during the latter part of 2000s. Based on National Statistical Service, Armenia&#x27;s construction sector generated approximately 20% of Armenia&#x27;s GDP during the first and second quarters of 2007. In 2009, according to the World Bank, 30% of Armenia&#x27;s economy was from construction sector.
* In Vietnam, the construction industry plays an important role in the national economy. The Vietnamese construction industry has been one of the fastest growing in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. The market was valued at nearly $60 billion in 2021. In the first half of 2022, Vietnam&#x27;s construction industry growth rate reached 5.59%. In 2022, Vietnam&#x27;s construction industry accounted for more than 6% of the country&#x27;s GDP, equivalent to over 589.7 billion Vietnamese dong. The industry of industry and construction accounts for 38.26% of Vietnam&#x27;s GDP. At the same time, the industry is one of the most attractive industries for foreign direct investment (FDI) in recent years.

Construction is a major source of employment in most countries; high reliance on small businesses, and under-representation of women are common traits. For example:
* In the US, construction employed around 11.4m people in 2020, with a further 1.8m employed in architectural, engineering, and related professional services – equivalent to just over 8% of the total US workforce. The construction workers were employed in over 843,000 organisations, of which 838,000 were privately held businesses. In March 2016, 60.4% of construction workers were employed by businesses with fewer than 50 staff. Women are substantially underrepresented (relative to their share of total employment), comprising 10.3% of the US construction workforce, and 25.9% of professional services workers, in 2019.
* The United Kingdom construction sector contributed £117 billion (6%) to UK GDP in 2018, and in 2019 employed 2.4m workers (6.6% of all jobs). These worked either for 343,000 &#x27;registered&#x27; construction businesses, or for &#x27;unregistered&#x27; businesses, typically self-employed contractors; just over one million small/medium-sized businesses, mainly self-employed individuals, worked in the sector in 2019, comprising about 18% of all UK businesses. Women comprised 12.5% of the UK construction workforce.

According to McKinsey research, productivity growth per worker in construction has lagged behind many other industries across different countries including in the United States and in European countries. In the United States, construction productivity per worker has declined by half since the 1960s.

===Employment===

Some workers may be engaged in manual labour as unskilled or semi-skilled workers; they may be skilled tradespeople; or they may be supervisory or managerial personnel. Under safety legislation in the United Kingdom, for example, construction workers are defined as people &quot;who work for or under the control of a contractor on a construction site&quot;; in Canada, this can include people whose work includes ensuring conformance with building codes and regulations, and those who supervise other workers.

Laborers comprise a large grouping in most national construction industries. In the United States, for example, in May 2023, the construction sector employed just over 7.9 million people, of whom 859,000 were laborers, while 3.7 million were construction trades workers (including 603,000 carpenters, 559,000 electricians, 385,000 plumbers, and 321,000 equipment operators). Like most business sectors, there is also substantial white-collar employment in construction - out of 7.9 million US construction sector workers, 681,000 were recorded by the United States Department of Labor in May 2023 as in &#x27;office and administrative support occupations&#x27;, 620,000 in &#x27;management occupations&#x27; and 480,000 in &#x27;business and financial operations occupations&#x27;.

Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines. A project manager normally manages the budget on the job, and a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or architect supervises it. Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements and legal issues, environmental impact of the project, scheduling, budgeting and bidding, construction site safety, availability and transportation of building materials, logistics, and inconvenience to the public, including those caused by construction delays.

Some models and policy-making organisations promote the engagement of local labour in construction projects as a means of tackling social exclusion and addressing skill shortages. In the UK, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported in 2000 on 25 projects which had aimed to offer training and employment opportunities for locally based school leavers and unemployed people. The Foundation published &quot;a good practice resource book&quot; in this regard at the same time. Use of local labour and local materials were specified for the construction of the Danish Storebaelt bridge, but there were legal issues which were challenged in court and addressed by the European Court of Justice in 1993. The court held that a contract condition requiring use of local labour and local materials was incompatible with EU treaty principles. Later UK guidance noted that social and employment clauses, where used, must be compatible with relevant EU regulation. Employment of local labour was identified as one of several social issues which could potentially be incorporated in a sustainable procurement approach, although the interdepartmental &quot;Sustainable Procurement Group&quot; recognised that &quot;there is far less scope to incorporate [such] social issues in public procurement than is the case with environmental issues&quot;.

There are many routes to the different careers within the construction industry. There are three main tiers of construction workers based on educational background and training, which vary by country:

====Unskilled and semi-skilled workers====
Unskilled and semi-skilled workers provide general site labor, often have few or no construction qualifications, and may receive basic site training.

====Skilled tradespeople====

Skilled tradespeople have typically served apprenticeships (sometimes in labor unions) or received technical training; this group also includes on-site managers who possess extensive knowledge and experience in their craft or profession. Skilled manual occupations include carpenters, electricians, plumbers, ironworkers, heavy equipment operators and masons, as well as those involved in project management. In the UK these require further education qualifications, often in vocational subject areas, undertaken either directly after completing compulsory education or through &quot;on the job&quot; apprenticeships.

====Professional, technical or managerial personnel====
Professional, technical and managerial personnel often have higher education qualifications, usually graduate degrees, and are trained to design and manage construction processes. These roles require more training as they demand greater technical knowledge, and involve more legal responsibility. Example roles (and qualification routes) include:
* Architect – Will usually have studied architecture to degree level, and then undertaken further study and gained professional experience. In many countries, the title of &quot;architect&quot; is protected by law, strictly limiting its use to qualified people.
* Civil engineer – Typically holds a degree in a related subject and may only be eligible for membership of a professional institution (such as the UK&#x27;s ICE) following completion of additional training and experience. In some jurisdictions, a new university graduate must hold a master&#x27;s degree to become chartered, and persons with bachelor&#x27;s degrees may become Incorporated Engineers.
* Building services engineer – May also be referred to as an &quot;M&amp;E&quot; or &quot;mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineer&quot; and typically holds a degree in mechanical or electrical engineering.
* Project manager – Typically holds a 4-year or greater higher education qualification, but are often also qualified in another field such as architecture, civil engineering or quantity surveying.
* Structural engineer – Typically holds a bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree in structural engineering.
* Quantity surveyor – Typically holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in quantity surveying. UK chartered status is gained from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

== Safety ==
Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union. In the US in 2019, 1,061, or about 20%, of worker fatalities in private industry occurred in construction. In 2017, more than a third of US construction fatalities (366 out of 971 total fatalities) were the result of falls; in the UK, half of the average 36 fatalities per annum over a five-year period to 2021 were attributed to falls from height. Proper safety equipment such as harnesses, hard hats and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution, transportation accidents, and trench cave-ins.

Other safety risks for workers in construction include hearing loss due to high noise exposure, musculoskeletal injury, chemical exposure, and high levels of stress. Besides that, the high turnover of workers in construction industry imposes a huge challenge of accomplishing the restructuring of work practices in individual workplaces or with individual workers. Construction has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues. A study conducted in 2022 found “significant effect of air pollution exposure on construction-related injuries and fatalities”, especially with the exposure of nitrogen dioxide.

=== Sustainability ===

Sustainability is an aspect of &quot;green building&quot;, defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as &quot;the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building&#x27;s life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction.&quot;

=== Decarbonising construction ===
The construction industry may require transformation at pace and at scale if it is to successfully contribute to achieving the target set out in The Paris Agreement of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C above industrial levels. The World Green Building Council has stated the buildings and infrastructure around the world can reach 40% less embodied carbon emissions but that this can only be achieved through urgent transformation.

Conclusions from industry leaders have suggested that the net zero transformation is likely to be challenging for the construction industry, but it does present an opportunity. Action is demanded from governments, standards bodies, the construction sector, and the engineering profession to meet the decarbonising targets.

In 2021, the National Engineering Policy Centre published its report &quot;Decarbonising Construction: Building a new net zero industry,&quot; which outlined key areas to decarbonise the construction sector and the wider built environment. This report set out around 20 different recommendations to transform and decarbonise the construction sector, including recommendations for engineers, the construction industry and decision makers, plus outlined six-overarching ‘system levers’ where action taken now will result in rapid decarbonisation of the construction sector. These levels are:
* Setting and stipulating progressive targets for carbon reduction
* Embedding quantitative whole-life carbon assessment into public procurement
* Increasing design efficiency, materials reuse and retrofit of buildings
* Improving whole-life carbon performance
* Improving skills for net zero
* Adopting a joined up, systems approach to decarbonisation across the construction sector and with other sectors

Progress is being made internationally to decarbonise the sector including improvements to sustainable procurement practice such as the CO2 performance ladder in the Netherlands and the Danish Partnership for Green Public Procurement. There are also now demonstrations of applying the principles of circular economy practices in practice such as Circl, ABN AMRO&#x27;s sustainable pavilion and the Brighton Waste House.

<doc id="239039" wikidata="Q3063461" url="?curid=239039" title="FUBU">
<text>FUBU (, ) is an American hip hop apparel company. FUBU stands for &quot;For Us, By Us&quot; and was created when the founders were brainstorming for a catchy four-letter word following other big brands such as Nike and Coke. It includes casual wear, sports wear, a suit collection, eyewear, belts, fragrances, and shoes.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1992 when Daymond John mortgaged his home for $100,000, and with that seed money, the company&#x27;s co-founders rebuilt half of his home as a factory while the other half remained living space. The clothing store Montego Bay, on Queens&#x27; Jamaica Avenue, was the first to carry the FUBU line. In the mid-1990s, high-end department store retailer Macy&#x27;s started stocking FUBU apparel and, at one point, featured the four FUBU founders in a live, interactive window display in its flagship store on 34th Street.

FUBU founders attended the MAGIC men’s apparel show in Las Vegas with samples and got $300,000 worth of orders, but had no idea how to fulfill them. John’s mother suggested they advertise in the New York Times for an investor. In 1995, South Korean company Samsung answered a classified ad and invested in FUBU.

At its peak in 1998, FUBU grossed over $350 million in annual worldwide sales. FUBU has received several honors for their entrepreneurial achievements. These include two Congressional Awards, two NAACP Awards, the Pratt Institute Award, the Christopher Wallace Award, the Online Hip-Hop Award and a Citation of Honor from the Queens Borough President.

In 1997, LL Cool J starred in a commercial for Gap Inc. in which he wore a FUBU hat and incorporated the phrase “For Us, By Us” into his rap lyrics. The commercial&#x27;s production team was unaware of the meaning behind LL&#x27;s FUBU references until the advertisement aired. The subsequent controversy proved to be a tremendous publicity boost for both companies by simultaneously establishing FUBU in the mainstream, while giving Gap street credibility.

In 2003, FUBU mostly withdrew from the U.S. market, concentrating its efforts in Saudi Arabia, China, Korea, Japan and South Africa, while acquiring other apparel brands. In 2009, the company&#x27;s annual revenue was around $200 million.

In 2010, FUBU relaunched its collection in the U.S., re-branding itself as FB Legacy.

In 2018, Puma, a footwear brand, began a collaboration with FUBU to create a number of shoes.

According to &quot;Complex&quot;, FUBU&#x27;s decline occurred due to its over saturating the market, as John has publicly stated, &quot;The biggest mistake we made with the brand was buying more inventory than we needed. This was around 2001.&quot; Since then, FUBU has continued to collaborate with various brands, including Pyer Moss and Urban Outfitters. In March 2019, FUBU announced a new partnership with Century 21.

In September 2020, Eye Candy Creations USA and FUBU announced their collaboration to design, create, produce and sell FUBU FRAMES, a sunglasses and optical collection worldwide.

=== Collection ===
The FUBU collection consists of T-shirts, rugby shirts, hockey and football jerseys, baseball caps, shoes, and denim jeans. All are embroidered with the FUBU logo. Most of the products, such as the jeans, are imported from around the world. FUBU has now expanded to include various lines such as Platinum FUBU, FUBU footwear for men and women, intimate apparel, active wear, swimwear, watches, FUBU suits, and FUBU tuxedos. The Platinum FUBU collection also includes the Fat Albert line where the FUBU founders first got approval from Bill Cosby.

== FUBU Records ==

From 2001 to 2003, FUBU established a record label, first releasing a compilation album entitled &quot;The Good Life&quot; in 2001 and then an album by the 54th Platoon entitled &quot;All or Nothin&#x27;&quot; in 2003. Both albums made it on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.
== In popular media ==
A FUBU shirt was an important plot element of the episode &quot;FUBU&quot; of the television series &quot;Atlanta&quot;.

In the film &quot;&quot;, Sarah Silverman states that Jewish people driving German cars is &quot;the opposite of FUBU&quot;.

<doc id="239041" wikidata="Q1763297" url="?curid=239041" title="Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales">
<text>The Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales (or more commonly the Stanford–Binet) is an individually administered intelligence test that was revised from the original Binet–Simon Scale by Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon. It is in its fifth edition (SB5), which was released in 2003. 

It is a cognitive-ability and intelligence test that is used to diagnose developmental or intellectual deficiencies in young children, in contrast to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). The test measures five weighted factors and consists of both verbal and nonverbal subtests. The five factors being tested are knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, working memory, and fluid reasoning.

The development of the Stanford–Binet initiated the modern field of intelligence testing and was one of the first examples of an adaptive test. The test originated in France, then was revised in the United States. It was initially created by the French psychologist Alfred Binet and the French psychiatrist Théodore Simon, who, following the introduction of a law mandating universal education by the French government, began developing a method of identifying &quot;slow&quot; children, so that they could be placed in special education programs, instead of labelled &quot;sick&quot; and sent to the asylum. As Binet and Simon indicated, case studies might be more detailed and helpful, but the time required to test many people would be excessive. In 1916, at Stanford University, the psychologist Lewis Terman released a revised examination that became known as the &quot;Stanford–Binet test&quot;.

== Development ==
As discussed by Fancher &amp; Rutherford in 2012, the Stanford–Binet is a modified version of the Binet–Simon Intelligence scale. The Binet–Simon scale was created by the French psychologist Alfred Binet and the French psychiatrist Theodore Simon. Due to the introduction of compulsory education at that time, questions were raised about children unfit for regular education, and a proposal was made to build boarding schools in asylums for them. Binet and Simon were part of a learned society that opposed the proposal and advocated the creation of remedial tracks in regular schools. They created the first intelligence test to objectively measure the intellectual functioning of primary school children. Binet and Simon believed that intelligence is malleable and that intelligence tests would help target children in need of extra attention to advance their intelligence.

To create their test, Binet and Simon first created a baseline of intelligence. A wide range of children were tested on a broad spectrum of measures in an effort to discover a clear indicator of intelligence. Failing to find a single identifier of intelligence, Binet and Simon instead compared children in each category by age. The children&#x27;s highest levels of achievement were sorted by age and common levels of achievement considered the normal level for that age. Because this testing method merely compares a person&#x27;s ability to the common ability level of others their age, the general practices of the test can easily be transferred to test different populations, even if the measures used are changed.

One of the first intelligence tests, the Binet–Simon test quickly gained support in the psychological community, many of whom further spread it to the public. Lewis M. Terman, a psychologist at Stanford University, was one of the first to create a version of the test for people in the United States, naming the first localized version the Stanford revision of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale (1916) and the second version the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale (1937). Terman used the test not only to help identify children with learning difficulties but also to find children and adults who had above average levels of intelligence. In creating his version, Terman also tested additional methods for his Stanford revision, publishing his first official version as The Measurement of Intelligence: An Explanation of and a Complete Guide for the Use of the Stanford Revision and Extension of the Binet–Simon Intelligence Scale (Fancher &amp; Rutherford, 2012) (Becker, 2003).

=== Historical use ===
One hindrance to widespread understanding of the test is its use of a variety of different measures. In an effort to simplify the information gained from the Binet–Simon test into a more comprehensible and easier to understand form, German psychologist William Stern created the well known Intelligence Quotient (IQ). By comparing the mental age a child scored at to their biological age, a ratio is created to show the rate of their mental progress as IQ. Terman quickly grasped the idea for his Stanford revision with the adjustment of multiplying the ratios by 100 to make them easier to read.

As also discussed by Leslie, in 2000, Terman was another of the main forces in spreading intelligence testing in the United States (Becker, 2003). Terman quickly promoted the use of the Stanford–Binet for schools across the United States where it saw a high rate of acceptance. Terman&#x27;s work also had the attention of the U.S. government, who recruited him to apply the ideas from his Stanford–Binet test for military recruitment near the start of World War I. With over 1.7 million military recruits taking a version of the test and the acceptance of the test by the government, the Stanford–Binet saw an increase in awareness and acceptance (Fancher &amp; Rutherford, 2012).

Given the perceived importance of intelligence and with new ways to measure intelligence, many influential individuals, including Terman, began promoting controversial ideas to increase the nation&#x27;s overall intelligence. These ideas included things such as discouraging individuals with low IQ from having children and granting important positions based on high IQ scores. While there was significant opposition, many institutions proceeded to adjust students&#x27; education based on their IQ scores, often with a heavy influence on future career possibilities (Leslie, 2000).

==Revisions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale==

Since the first publication in 1916, there have been four additional revised editions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, the first of which was developed by Lewis Terman. Over twenty years later, Maud Merrill was accepted into Stanford&#x27;s education program shortly before Terman became the head of the psychology department. She completed both her master&#x27;s degree and Ph.D. under Terman and quickly became a colleague of his as they started the revisions of the second edition together. There were 3,200 examinees, aged one and a half to eighteen years, ranging in different geographic regions as well as socioeconomic levels in attempts to comprise a broader normative sample (Roid &amp; Barram, 2004). This edition incorporated more objectified scoring methods, while placing less emphasis on recall memory and including a greater range of nonverbal abilities (Roid &amp; Barram, 2004) compared to the 1916 edition.

When Terman died in 1956, the revisions for the third edition were well underway, and Merrill was able to publish the final revision in 1960 (Roid &amp; Barram, 2004). The use of deviation IQ made its first appearance in third edition, however the use of the mental age scale and ratio IQ were not eliminated. Terman and Merrill attempted to calculate IQs with a uniform standard deviation while still maintaining the use of the mental age scale by including a formula in the manual to convert the ratio IQs with means varying between age ranges and nonuniform standard deviations to IQs with a mean of 100 and a uniform standard deviation of 16. However, it was later demonstrated that very high scores occurred with much greater frequency than what would be predicted by the normal curve with a standard deviation of 16, and scores in the gifted range were much higher than those yielded by essentially every other major test, so it was deemed that the ratio IQs modified to have a uniform mean and standard deviation, referred to as &quot;deviation IQs&quot; in the manual of the third edition of the Stanford–Binet (Terman &amp; Merrill, 1960), could not be directly compared to scores on &quot;true&quot; deviation IQ tests, such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scales, and the later versions of the Stanford–Binet, as those tests compare the performance of examinees to their own age group on a normal distribution (Ruf, 2003). While new features were added, there were no newly created items included in this revision. Instead, any items from the 1937 form that showed no substantial change in difficulty from the 1930s to the 1950s were either eliminated or adjusted (Roid &amp; Barram, 2004).

Robert Thorndike was asked to take over after Merrill&#x27;s retirement. With the help of Elizabeth Hagen and Jerome Sattler, Thorndike produced the fourth edition of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale in 1986. This edition covers the ages two through twenty-three and has some considerable changes compared to its predecessors (Graham &amp; Naglieri, 2003). This edition was the first to use the fifteen subtests with point scales in place of using the previous age scale format. In an attempt to broaden cognitive ability, the subtests were grouped and resulted in four area scores, which improved flexibility for administration and interpretation (Youngstrom, Glutting, &amp; Watkins, 2003). The fourth edition is known for assessing children that may be referred for gifted programs. This edition includes a broad range of abilities, which provides more challenging items for those in their early adolescent years, whereas other intelligence tests of the time did not provide difficult enough items for the older children (Laurent, Swerdlik, &amp; Ryburn, 1992).

Gale Roid published the most recent edition of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale. Roid attended Harvard University where he was a research assistant to David McClelland. McClelland is well known for his studies on the need for achievement. While the fifth edition incorporates some of the classical traditions of these scales, there were several significant changes made.

==Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale: Fifth Edition==
Just as it was used when Binet first developed the IQ test, the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale: Fifth Edition (SB5) is based in the schooling process to assess intelligence. It continuously and efficiently assesses all levels of ability in individuals with a broader range in age. It is also capable of measuring multiple dimensions of abilities (Ruf, 2003).

The SB5 can be administered to individuals as early as two years of age. There are ten subsets included in this revision including both verbal and nonverbal domains. Five factors are also incorporated in this scale, which are directly related to Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) hierarchical model of cognitive abilities. These factors include fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, and working memory (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). Many of the familiar picture absurdities, vocabulary, memory for sentences, and verbal absurdities still remain from the previous editions (Janzen, Obrzut, &amp; Marusiak, 2003), however with more modern artwork and item content for the revised fifth edition.

For every verbal subtest that is used, there is a nonverbal counterpart across all factors. These nonverbal tasks consist of making movement responses such as pointing or assembling manipulatives (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). These counterparts have been included to address language-reduced assessments in multicultural societies. Depending on age and ability, administration can range from fifteen minutes to an hour and fifteen minutes.

The fifth edition incorporated a new scoring system, which can provide a wide range of information such as four intelligence score composites, five factor indices, and ten subtest scores. Additional scoring information includes percentile ranks, age equivalents, and a change-sensitive score (Janzen, Obrzut, &amp; Marusiak, 2003). Extended IQ scores and gifted composite scores are available with the SB5 in order to optimize the assessment for gifted programs (Ruf, 2003). To reduce errors and increase diagnostic precision, scores are obtained electronically through the use of computers now.

The standardization sample for the SB5 included 4,800 participants varying in age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and socioeconomic level (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005).

===Reliability===
Several reliability tests have been performed on the SB5 including split-half reliability, standard error of measurement, plotting of test information curves, test-retest stability, and inter-scorer agreement. On average, IQ scores for this scale have been found quite stable across time (Janzen, Obrzut, &amp; Marusiak, 2003). Internal consistency was tested by split-half reliability and was reported to be substantial and comparable to other cognitive batteries (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). The median interscorer correlation was .90 on average (Janzen, Obrzut, &amp; Marusiak, 2003). The SB5 has also been found to have great precision at advanced levels of performance meaning that the test is especially useful in testing children for giftedness (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). There have only been a small amount of practice effects and familiarity of testing procedures with retest reliability; however, these have proven to be insignificant. Readministration of the SB5 can occur in a six-month interval rather than one year due to the small mean differences in reliability (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005).

===Validity===
Content validity has been found based on the professional judgments Roid received concerning fairness of items and item content as well as items concerning the assessment of giftedness (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005). With an examination of age trends, construct validity was supported along with empirical justification of a more substantial &quot;g&quot; loading for the SB5 compared to previous editions. The potential for a variety of comparisons, especially for within or across factors and verbal/nonverbal domains, has been appreciated with the scores received from the SB5 (Bain &amp; Allin, 2005).

===Score classification===
The test publisher includes suggested score classifications in the test manual.

The classifications of scores used in the Fifth Edition differ from those used in earlier versions of the test.

== Recent use ==
Since its inception, the Stanford–Binet has been revised several times. The test is in its fifth edition, called the &quot;Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition&quot;, or SB5. According to the publisher&#x27;s website, &quot;The SB5 was normed on a stratified random sample of 4,800 individuals that matches the 2000 U.S. Census&quot;. By administering the Stanford–Binet test to large numbers of individuals selected at random from different parts of the United States, it has been found that the scores approximate a normal distribution. The revised edition of the Stanford–Binet over time has devised substantial changes in the way the tests are presented. The test has improved when looking at the introduction of a more parallel form and more demonstrative standards. For one, a non-verbal IQ component is included in the tests whereas in the past, there was only a verbal component. It evolved to have equally balanced verbal and non-verbal content. It is also more animated than the other tests, providing the test-takers with more colourful artwork, toys and manipulatives. This allows the test to have a higher range in the age of the test takers. This test is purportedly useful in assessing the intellectual capabilities of people ranging from young children all the way to young adults. However, the test has come under criticism for not being able to compare people of different age categories, since each category gets a different set of tests. Furthermore, very young children tend to do poorly on the test because they lack the ability to concentrate long enough to finish it.

Uses for the test include clinical and neuropsychological assessment, educational placement, compensation evaluations, career assessment, adult neuropsychological treatment, forensics, and research on aptitude. Various high-IQ societies also accept this test for admission into their ranks; for example, the Triple Nine Society accepts a minimum qualifying score of 151 for Form L or M, 149 for Form L-M if taken in 1986 or earlier, 149 for SB-IV, and 146 for SB-V; in all cases the applicant must have been at least 16 years old at the date of the test. Intertel accepts a score of 135 on SB5 and 137 on Form L-M.

<text>Shampoohorn is an album by Dweezil and Ahmet Zappa, under the group name Z, released in 1993.

The European version of the album was released months before the American version. Between the release of the two versions, Dweezil Zappa fired longtime Zappa bassist Scott Thunes due to inter-band conflicts, and hired bassist Bryan Beller, a Berklee honors graduate based on the recommendation of drummer Joe Travers (who had played extensively with Beller at Berklee) and an exhausting 5-day audition. After this change, the band continued to record. As a result, the European version of the album differs from the American version, which replaces &quot;What Went Wrong In The Real World?&quot;, and &quot;Bellybutton&quot; with &quot;In My Mind&quot; and &quot;My Beef Mailbox&quot;, both featuring Beller on bass.

<text>A project manager is a professional in the field of project management. Project managers have the responsibility of the planning, procurement and execution of a project, in any undertaking that has a defined scope, defined start and a defined finish; regardless of industry. Project managers are first point of contact for any issues or discrepancies arising from within the heads of various departments in an organization before the problem escalates to higher authorities, as project representative.

Project management is the responsibility of a project manager. This individual seldom participates directly in the activities that produce the result, but rather strives to maintain the progress, mutual interaction and tasks of various parties in such a way that reduces the risk of overall failure, maximizes benefits, and minimizes costs.

== Overview ==
A project manager is the person responsible for accomplishing the project objectives. Key project management responsibilities include 
* defining and communicating project objectives that are clear, useful and attainable
* procuring the project requirements like workforce, required information, various agreements and material or technology needed to accomplish project objectives
* managing the constraints of the project management triangle, which are &quot;cost&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;scope&quot; and quality
A project manager is a client representative and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the organization they are representing. An expertise is required in the domain the project managers are working to efficiently handle all the aspects of the project. The ability to adapt to the various internal procedures of the client and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that the key issues of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realized.

== Project management key topics ==
Important areas of project management may include:

* specifying reasons for the importance of a project
* specifying the quality of deliverables
* resource-estimation
* estimating timescales
* negotiating investment, corporate agreement and funding
* implementation of a management plan in a project
* team-building and motivation
* risk assessments and changes in a project
* maintain sustaining projects
* monitoring progress against plans
* stakeholder management
* provider-management
* closing the project

George Roth and Hilary Bradbury identify a desire for more non-authoritarian leadership in project work.

=== Project tools ===
Some tools, knowledge and techniques for managing projects may be unique to project management - for example: work-breakdown structures, critical-path analysis and earned-value management. Understanding and applying the tools and techniques which are generally recognized as good practices are not sufficient alone for effective project management. Effective project management requires that the project manager understands and uses the knowledge and skills from at least four areas of expertise. Examples are PMBOK, Application Area Knowledge: standards and regulations set forth by ISO for project management, General Management Skills and Project Environment Management There are many options for project-management software to assist in executing projects for project managers and any associated teams.

=== Project teams ===
If recruiting and building an effective team, the manager must consider not only the technical skills of each team member, but also the critical roles of and chemistry between workers. A project team has mainly three separate components: project manager, core team and contracted team.

=== Risk ===
Most of the project-management issues that influence a project arise from risk, which in turn arises from uncertainty. Successful project managers focus on this as their main concern and attempt to reduce risk significantly, often by adhering to a policy of open communication, ensuring that project participants can voice their opinions and concerns.

== Responsibilities ==

The project manager is accountable for ensuring that everyone on the team knows and executes his or her role, feels empowered and supported in the role, knows the roles of the other team members and acts upon the belief that those roles will be performed. The specific responsibilities of the project manager may vary depending on the industry, the company size, the company maturity, and the company culture. However, there are some responsibilities that are common to all project managers, noting:

* Developing the project plans
* Managing the project stakeholders
* Managing communication
* Managing the project team
* Managing the project risks
* Managing the project schedule
*Managing the project budget
* Managing the project conflicts
* Managing the project delivery
*Contract administration

== Types ==

=== Architectural project manager ===
Architectural project manager are project managers in the field of architecture. They have many of the same skills as their counterpart in the construction industry. And will often work closely with the construction project manager in the office of the general contractor (GC), and at the same time, coordinate the work of the design team and numerous consultants who contribute to a construction project, and manage communication with the client. The issues of budget, scheduling, and quality control are the responsibility of the project manager in an architect&#x27;s office.

=== Construction manager ===

Construction managers are primarily involved in the areas of design, bidding, contact management and construction of a project, as well as the in-between phases and post-construction. 

Until recently, the American construction industry lacked any level of standardization, with individual States determining the eligibility requirements within their jurisdiction. However, several trade associations based in the United States have made strides in creating a commonly accepted set of qualifications and tests to determine a project manager&#x27;s competency.

* The Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) maintains the Certified Construction Manager (CCM) designation. The purpose of the CCM is to standardize the education, experience and professional understanding needed to practice construction management at the highest level.
* The Project Management Institute has made some headway into being a standardizing body with its creation of the Project Management Professional (PMP) designation.
* The Constructor Certification Commission of the American Institute of Constructors holds semiannual nationwide tests. Eight American Construction Management programs require that students take these exams before they may receive their Bachelor of Science in construction management degree, and 15 other universities actively encourage their students to consider the exams.
* The Associated Colleges of Construction Education and the Associated Schools of Construction have made considerable progress in developing national standards for construction education programs.

The profession has recently grown to accommodate several dozen construction management Bachelor of Science programs.
Many universities have also begun offering a master&#x27;s degree in project management. These programs generally are tailored to working professionals who have project management experience or project related experience; they provide a more intense and in depth education surrounding the knowledge areas within the project management body of knowledge.

The United States Navy construction battalions, nicknamed the SeaBees, puts their command through strenuous training and certifications at every level. To become a chief petty officer in the SeaBees is equivalent to a BS in construction management with the added benefit of several years of experience to their credit. See ACE accreditation.

=== Engineering project manager ===
In engineering, project management involves seeing a product or device through the developing and manufacturing stages, working with various professionals in different fields of engineering and manufacturing to go from concept to finished product. Optionally, this can include different versions and standards as required by different countries, requiring knowledge of laws, requirements and infrastructure.

=== Insurance claim project manager ===
In the insurance industry project managers often oversee and manage the restoration of a client&#x27;s home/office after a fire, flood, or other disaster, covering the fields from electronics through to the demolition and construction contractors.

=== IT project manager ===
IT project management generally falls into two categories, namely software (development) project manager and infrastructure project manager.

====Software project manager====
A software project manager has many of the same skills as their counterparts in other industries. Beyond the skills normally associated with traditional project management in industries such as construction and manufacturing, a software project manager will typically have an extensive background in software development. Many software project managers hold a degree in computer science, information technology, management of information systems or another related field.

In traditional project management a heavyweight, predictive methodology such as the waterfall model is often employed, but software project managers must also be skilled in more lightweight, adaptive methodologies such as DSDM, Scrum and XP. These project management methodologies are based on the uncertainty of developing a new software system and advocate smaller, incremental development cycles. These incremental or iterative cycles are time boxed (constrained to a known period of time, typically from one to four weeks) and produce a working subset of the entire system deliverable at the end of each iteration. The increasing adoption of lightweight approaches is due largely to the fact that software requirements are very susceptible to change, and it is extremely difficult to illuminate all the potential requirements in a single project phase before the software development commences.

The software project manager is also expected to be familiar with the software development life cycle (SDLC). This may require in-depth knowledge of requirements solicitation, application development, logical and physical database design and networking. This knowledge is typically the result of the aforementioned education and experience. There is not a widely accepted certification for software project managers, but many will hold the Project Management Professional (PMP) designation offered by the Project Management Institute, PRINCE2 or an advanced degree in project management, such as a MSPM or other graduate degree in technology management.

====IT infrastructure project management====
An infrastructure IT PM is concerned with the nuts and bolts of the IT department, including computers, servers, storage, networking, and such aspects of them as backup, business continuity, upgrades, replacement, and growth. Often, a secondary data center will be constructed in a remote location to help protect the business from outages caused by natural disasters or weather. Recently, cyber security has become a significant growth area within IT infrastructure management.

The infrastructure PM usually has an undergraduate degree in engineering or computer science, while a master&#x27;s degree in project management is required for senior-level positions. Along with the formal education, most senior-level PMs are certified, by the Project Management Institute, as Project Management professionals. PMI also has several additional certification options, but PMP is by far the most popular.

Infrastructure PMs are responsible for managing projects that have budgets from a few thousand dollars up to many millions of dollars. They must understand the business and the business goals of the sponsor and the capabilities of the technology in order to reach the desired goals of the project. The most difficult part of the infrastructure PM&#x27;s job maybe this translation of business needs / wants into technical specifications. Oftentimes, business analysts are engaged to help with this requirement. The team size of a large infrastructure project may run into several hundred engineers and technicians, many of whom have strong personalities and require strong leadership if the project goals are to be met.

Due to the high operations expense of maintaining a large staff of highly skilled IT engineering talent, many organizations outsource their infrastructure implementations and upgrades to third-party companies. Many of these companies have strong project management organizations with the ability to not only manage their clients projects, but to also generate high quality revenue at the same time.

=== Social science research project manager ===
Project managers in the field of social science have many of the same skills as their counterparts in the IT industry. For example, project managers for the 2020 United States Census followed program and project management policies, framework, and control processes for all projects established within the program. They managed projects designed as part of the program to produce official statistics, such as projects in systems engineering, questionnaire design, sampling, data collection, and public communications. Project managers of qualitative research studies must also manage scope, schedule, and cost related to research design, participant recruitment, interviewing, reporting, as well as stakeholder engagement.

With Camilla Ottesen and Remee as the presenters, the contest was won by the then eleven-year-old Dino Jelusić, who represented with his song &quot;Ti si moja prva ljubav&quot; (You are my first love) while second and third place went to and the respectively. The next time that a country would win on its first attempt was in .

It was the first Eurovision contest to be broadcast in the 16:9 widescreen and high definition, but was also offered to broadcasters in the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio. It was also the first Eurovision Song Contest where a DVD of the contest would be released. It was decided that the country that won the contest would not necessarily host the next contest, to reduce the pressure on the contestants. It was announced before the contest took place that the next edition would be held in the United Kingdom (although in the end this did not happen).

== Origins and history ==

The origins of the contest date back to 2000 when Danmarks Radio held a song contest for Danish children that year and the following year. The idea was extended to a Scandinavian song competition in 2002, known as MGP Nordic, with Denmark, Norway and Sweden as participants. The EBU picked up the idea for a song contest featuring children and opened the competition to all EBU member broadcasters making it a pan-European event. The working title of the programme was &quot;Eurovision Song Contest for Children&quot;, branded with the name of the EBU&#x27;s long-running and already popular song competition, the Eurovision Song Contest.

== Location ==

Denmark was asked to host the first programme after their experience with their own contests and the MGP Nordic. Copenhagen was confirmed as the host city in November 2002. In January 2003, it was announced that the Danish broadcaster would host the inaugural contest at the 8,000 capacity Forum venue in the Danish capital.

===Venue===

Forum Copenhagen () is a large multi-purpose, rentable indoor arena located in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, Denmark. It hosts a large variety of concerts, markets, exhibitions and other events. The venue can hold up to 10,000 people depending on the event. The Forum operates as a convention center, concert hall and indoor arena.

It was opened in February 1926 to host a car exhibition and was last renovated in 1996–97. Over two storeys there is a combined exhibition floor area of 5,000 m2 and a separate restaurant for up to 250 seated guests. The Metro station Forum is adjacent to the building. Forum Copenhagen was designed by Oscar Gundlach-Pedersen, and the lighting was from Poul Henningsen&#x27;s brand new PH-lamp. In 1929 it held an architecture exhibition, which was one of the first presentations of functionalism in Denmark, namely the Housing and Building Exhibition in Forum. It was at this exhibition that Arne Jacobsen and Flemming Lassen exhibited their subscription to the cylindrical &quot;House of the Future&quot;.

== Participating countries ==

In May 2003, the EBU released the initial list of participants with 16 competing countries, in the first edition of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. In an original press release for the contest, then entitled the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest for Children&quot;, a draw was held to select 15 countries to take part in the inaugural contest, with Slovakian broadcaster Slovenská televízia (STV) and German broadcaster ARD being drawn to compete along with 13 other countries.

These countries would eventually be replaced by entries from , (added as 16th country before Germany and Slovakia withdrew) and , in their first ever Eurovision event. There were also reports that Finnish broadcaster Yle had planned to enter in the contest, but went on to just broadcast it instead.

Prior to the event, a compilation album featuring all the songs from the 2003 contest, along with karaoke versions, was put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by Universal Music Group in November 2003.

==Format==
===Presenters===
In February 2003, there was speculation regarding the potential host of the first ever Eurovision Song Contest for Children. Initially, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organizer of the show, announced the possible allocation of this role to Irish vocalist and Eurovision Song Contest 1997 co-host Ronan Keating although no contract had yet been signed. On 10 October 2003, however, it was officially announced that the contest would be hosted by the Danish duo consisting of Camilla Ottesen and rapper Remee.

===Voting===
All countries used televoting to decide on their top ten. In normal Eurovision fashion, each country&#x27;s favourite song was given 12 points, their second favourite 10, and their third to tenth favourites were given 8–1 points.

===Postcards===
The postcards featured all of the participants (and their backing dancers/singers) exploring different parts of Copenhagen. The postcard&#x27;s audio would be an instrumental version of the opening theme. The following list shows the various places they visited:
# The Tivoli Gardens
# Forum Copenhagen
# Royal Danish Theatre
# Danish Aquarium
# Strøget
# Copenhagen Lakes
# A hotel in Copenhagen
# Hairdressers in Copenhagen
# Parken
# Copenhagen Skatepark
# Copenhagen Zoo
# A hotdog stand in Copenhagen
# The Round Tower
# A riding school in Copenhagen
# An internet café in Copenhagen
==Contest overview==
The event took place on 15 November 2003 at 20:00 CET. Sixteen countries participated, with the running order published on 6 October 2003. All the countries competing were eligible to vote by televote. Croatia won with 134 points, with Spain, the United Kingdom, Belarus, and Denmark, completing the top five. Macedonia, Norway, Cyprus, Sweden, and Poland, occupied the bottom five positions.

The show was opened by Danish boy band and dance crew Dance Faction. The interval act included two British acts: the Sugababes performed &quot;Hole in the Head&quot;, while Busted, with the exception of Charlie Simpson absent due to illness, performed &quot;Crashed the Wedding&quot;.

== Detailed voting results ==

=== 12 points ===
Below is a summary of the maximum 12 points each country awarded to another:

== Other countries ==
For a country to be eligible for potential participation in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, it needs to be an active member of the EBU. It is currently unknown whether the EBU issue invitations of participation to all 56 active members like they do for the Eurovision Song Contest.

* Finnish broadcaster Yle expressed an interest in participating in the contest. However, it was unsuccessful and they went on to broadcast it instead.
* The EBU announced that they would hold a draw to determine which countries would participate in the contest. German broadcaster KiKa was one of the countries drawn. However, they announced their withdrawal from the contest and went on to broadcast it instead. Germany wouldn&#x27;t debut at Junior Eurovision until 2020.
* After Germany and Slovakia withdrew, the EBU sent an invitation to Irish broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) who then submitted preliminary applications, but in the end declined to participate or broadcast the contest. Ireland did, however, debut with TG4 as the broadcaster in 2015.
* The EBU also sent an invitation to the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA), but they declined to participate and also did not broadcast it. Ireland and Israel would later be replaced by Poland and Belarus, who received the final spot.
* Slovakian broadcaster Slovenská televízia (STV), along with KiKa, was drawn to participate in the contest, however declined to participate and did not broadcast the show either.

== Broadcasts ==
The rights to broadcast the contest were also acquired by broadcasters in Iceland (RÚV), Finland (Yle), Serbia and Montenegro (RTS/RTCG), Estonia (ETV), Germany (KI.KA), Australia (SBS) and Kosovo (RTK). Some of the participating broadcasters also transmitted the programme live on radio.

<doc id="239053" wikidata="Q5164449" url="?curid=239053" title="Construction delay">
<text>Construction delays are situations where project events occur at a later time than expected due to causes related to the client, consultant, and contractor etc. In residential and light construction, construction delays are often the result of miscommunication between contractors, subcontractors, and property owners. These types of misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations are usually avoided through the use of detailed critical path schedules, which specify the work, and timetable to be used, but most importantly, the logical sequence of events which must occur for a project to be completed.

==Incidence and impact of delays==
In more complex projects, problems will arise that are not foreseen in the original contract, and so other legal construction forms are subsequently used, such as change orders, lien waivers, and addenda. In construction projects, besides other projects where a schedule is being used to plan work, delays are likely to happen all the time. Delays in construction projects are frequently expensive, since there is usually a construction loan involved which charges interest, management staff dedicated to the project whose costs are time dependent, and ongoing inflation in wage and material prices.

==Analysis of delays==
What is being delayed determines if a project, or some other deadline such as a milestone, will be completed late. Before analyzing construction delays, a clear understanding of the general types is necessary. There are four basic ways to categorize delays:

* Critical or Non-Critical
* Excusable or Non-Excusable
* Concurrent or Non-Concurrent
* Compensable or Non-Compensable

Before determining the impact of a delay on the project, one must determine whether the delay is critical or non-critical. Additionally, all delays are either excusable or non-excusable. Both excusable and non-excusable delays can be defined as either concurrent or non-concurrent. Delays can be further broken down into compensable or non-compensable delays.

==Management solutions to delays==
Construction supply chain plays a major role in construction market competition. Construction supply chain management assists enterprises by helping to improve competitiveness, increase profits and have more control over the different factors and variables within the project. A. Cox and P. Ireland illustrated the myriad of construction supply chains which constitute the main flows within the construction supply chain. In his research, Ghaith Al-Werikat analysed delays in relation to the myriad of construction supply chains. In particular, material flow, equipment flow, information flow, labour flow and client&#x27;s information flow, offering a quantification of the impact of supply chain delays on construction projects performance. On the other hand, Economic historian Robert E. Wright argues that construction delays are caused by bid gaming, change order artistry, asymmetric information, and post contractual market power. Until those fundamental issues are confronted and resolved, many custom construction projects will continue to come in over budget, past due, or below contract specifications, he claims.

<doc id="239055" wikidata="Q184355" url="?curid=239055" title="Mojave Desert">
<text>The Mojave Desert (; ; ) is a desert in the rain shadow of the southern Sierra Nevada mountains and Transverse Ranges in the Southwestern United States. Named for the indigenous Mohave people, it is located primarily in southeastern California and southwestern Nevada, with small portions extending into Arizona and Utah.

The Mojave Desert, together with the Sonoran, Chihuahuan, and Great Basin deserts, form a larger North American desert. Of these, the Mojave is the smallest and driest. It displays typical basin and range topography, generally having a pattern of a series of parallel mountain ranges and valleys. It is also the site of Death Valley, which is the lowest elevation in North America. The Mojave Desert is often colloquially called the &quot;high desert&quot;, as most of it lies between . It supports a diversity of flora and fauna.

The desert supports a number of human activities, including recreation, ranching, and military training. The Mojave Desert also contains various silver, tungsten, iron and gold deposits.

The spelling &quot;Mojave&quot; originates from the Spanish language, while the spelling &quot;Mohave&quot; comes from modern English. Both are used today, although the Mojave Tribal Nation officially uses the spelling &quot;Mojave&quot;, which is a shortened form of , an endonym in their native language, meaning &quot;beside the water&quot;.

==Geography==

The Mojave Desert is a desert bordered to the west by the Sierra Nevada mountain range and the California montane chaparral and woodlands, and to the south and east by the Sonoran Desert. The boundaries to the east of the Mojave Desert are less distinctive than the other boundaries because there is no presence of an indicator species, such as the Joshua tree (&quot;Yucca brevifolia&quot;), which is endemic to the Mojave Desert. The Mojave Desert is distinguished from the Sonoran Desert and other deserts adjacent to it by its warm temperate climate, as well as flora and fauna such as ironwood (&quot;Olneya&quot; &quot;tesota&quot;), blue Palo Verde (&quot;Parkinsonia florida&quot;), chuparosa (&quot;Justicia californica&quot;), spiny menodora (&quot;Menodora spinescens&quot;), desert senna (&quot;Cassia armata&quot;), California dalea (&quot;Psorothamnus arborescens&quot;), California fan palm (Washingtonia filifera) and goldenhead (&quot;Acamptopappus shockleyi&quot;). Along with these other factors, these plants differentiate the Mojave from the nearby Sonoran Desert.

The Mojave Desert is bordered by the San Andreas Fault to the southwest and the Garlock fault to the north. The mountains elevated along the length of the San Andreas fault provide a clear border between the Mojave Desert and the coastal regions to the west. The Garlock fault separates the Mojave Desert from the Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi mountains, which provide a natural border to the Mojave Desert. There are also abundant alluvial fans, which are called bajadas, that form around the mountains within the Mojave Desert and extend down toward the low altitude basins, which contain dried lake beds called playas, where water generally collects and evaporates, leaving large volumes of salt. These playas include Rogers Dry Lake and China Lake. Dry lakes are a noted feature of the Mojave landscape. The Mojave Desert is also home to the Devils Playground, about of dunes and salt flats going in a northwest-southeasterly direction. The Devil&#x27;s Playground is a part of the Mojave National Preserve and is between the town of Baker, California and the Providence Mountains. The Cronese Mountains are within the Devil&#x27;s Playground.

There are very few surface rivers in the Mojave Desert, but two major rivers generally flow underground. One is the intermittent Mojave River, which begins in the San Bernardino mountains and disappears underground in the Mojave Desert. The other is the Amargosa River, which flows partly underground through the Mojave Desert along a southward path. The Manix, Mojave, and the Little Mojave lakes are all large but shallow. Soda Lake is the principal saline basin of the Mojave Desert. Natural springs are typically rare throughout the Mojave Desert, but there are two notable springs, Ash Meadows and Oasis Valley. Ash Meadows is formed from several other springs, which all draw from deep underground. Oasis Valley draws from the nearby Amargosa River.

=== Climate ===
Extremes in temperatures throughout the seasons characterize the climate of the Mojave Desert. Freezing temperatures and strong winds are not uncommon in the winter, as well as precipitation such as rain and snow in the mountains. In contrast, temperatures above are not uncommon during the summer months. There is an annual average precipitation of , although regions at high altitudes such as the portion of the Mojave Desert in the San Gabriel mountains may receive more rain. Most of the precipitation in the Mojave comes from the Pacific Cyclonic storms that are generally present passing eastward in November to April. Such storms generally bring rain and snow only in the mountainous regions, as a result of the effect of the mountains, which creates a drying effect on its leeward slopes.

During the late summer months, there is also the possibility of strong thunderstorms, which bring heavy showers or cloudbursts. These storms can result in flash flooding.

The Mojave Desert has not historically supported a fire regime because of low fuel loads and connectivity. However, in the last few decades, invasive annual plants such as some within the genera &quot;Bromus&quot;, &quot;Schismus&quot; and &quot;Brassica&quot; have facilitated fires by serving as a fuel bed. This has significantly altered many areas of the desert. At higher elevations, fire regimes are regular but infrequent.



===Cities and regions ===


While the Mojave Desert is generally sparsely populated, it has increasingly become urbanized in recent years. The metropolitan areas include Las Vegas, the largest urban area in the Mojave and the largest urban area in Nevada with a population of about 2.3 million. St. George, Utah, is the northeasternmost metropolitan area in the Mojave, with a population of around 180,000 in 2020, and is located at the convergence of the Mojave, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau. The Los Angeles exurban area of Lancaster-Palmdale has more than 400,000 residents, and the Victorville area to its east has more than 300,000 residents. Smaller cities or micropolitan areas in the Mojave Desert include Helendale, Lake Havasu City, Kingman, Laughlin, Bullhead City and Pahrump. All have experienced rapid population growth since 1990. The California portion of the desert also contains Edwards Air Force Base and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, noted for experimental aviation and weapons projects.

The Mojave Desert has several ghost towns. The most significant are the silver and copper-mining town of Calico, California, and the old railroad depot of Kelso, California. Some of the other ghost towns are more modern, created when U.S. Route 66 (and the lesser-known U.S. Route 91) was abandoned in favor of the construction of Interstates. CA SR 14, Interstate 15, Interstate 40, CA SR 58, CA SR 138, US Route 95, and US Route 395 are the main highways that traverse the Mojave Desert.

The exposed geology of the Death Valley presents a diverse and complex set of at least 23 formations of sedimentary units, two major gaps in the geologic record called unconformities, and at least one distinct set of related formations geologists call a group. The oldest rocks in the area that now includes Death Valley National Park are extensively metamorphosed by intense heat and pressure and are at least 1700 million years old. These rocks were intruded by a mass of granite 1400 Ma (million years ago) and later uplifted and exposed to nearly 500 million years of erosion.

The rock that forms the Mojave Desert was created under shallow water in the Precambrian, forming thick sequences of conglomerate, mudstone, and carbonate rock topped by stromatolites, and possibly glacial deposits from the hypothesized Snowball Earth event. Rifting thinned huge roughly linear parts of the supercontinent Rodinia enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A passive margin developed on the edges of these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two margins only to be subsided as the continental crust thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new ocean basin. An accretion wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate at the base of the submerged precipice, entombing the region&#x27;s first known fossils of complex life.

During the Paleozoic era, the area that is now the Mojave was again likely submerged under a greater sea. The passive margin switched to active margin in the early-to-mid Mesozoic when the Farallon Plate under the Pacific Ocean started to dive below the North American Plate, initiating a subduction zone; volcanoes and uplifting mountains were produced as a result. Erosion over many millions of years formed a relatively featureless plain. 

Stretching of the crust under western North America started around 16 Ma and is thought to be caused by upwelling from the subducted spreading-zone of the Farallon Plate. This process continues into the present and is thought to be responsible for producing the Basin and Range province. By 2 to 3 million years ago this province had spread to the Death Valley area, ripping it apart and giving birth to Death Valley, Panamint Valley and surrounding ranges. These valleys partially filled with sediment and, during colder periods during the current ice age, with lakes. Lake Manly was the largest of these lakes; it filled Death Valley during each glacial period from 240,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago. By 10,500 years ago these lakes were increasingly cut off from glacial melt from the Sierra Nevada, starving them of water and concentrating salts and minerals. The desert environment seen today developed after these lakes dried up.

The Mojave Desert is a source of various minerals and metallic materials. Due to the climate, there is an accumulation of weathered bedrock, fine sand and silt, both sand and silt sediments becoming converted into colluvium. The deposits of gold, tungsten, and silver have been mined frequently prior to the Second World War. Additionally, there have been deposits of copper, tin, lead-zinc, manganese, iron, and various radioactive substances but they have not been mined for commercial use.

==Ecology==

===Flora===
The flora of the Mojave Desert consists of various endemic plant species, notably the Joshua Tree, which is a notable endemic and indicator species of the desert. There is more endemic flora in the Mojave Desert than almost anywhere in the world. Mojave Desert flora is not a vegetation type, although the plants in the area have evolved in isolation because of the physical barriers of the Sierra Nevadas and the Colorado Plateau. Predominant plants of the Mojave Desert include all-scale (&quot;Atriplex polycarpa&quot;), creosote bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;), brittlebush (&quot;Encelia farinosa&quot;), desert holly (&quot;Atriplex hymenelytra&quot;), white burrobush (Hymenoclea salsola), and most notably, the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia). Additionally, the Mojave Desert is also home to various species of cacti, such as silver cholla (&quot;Cylindropuntia echinocarpa&quot;), Mojave prickly pear (&quot;O. erinacea&quot;), beavertail cactus (&quot;O. basilaris&quot;), and many-headed barrel cactus (&quot;Echinocactus polycephalus&quot;). Less common but distinctive plants of the Mojave Desert include ironwood (&quot;Olneya&quot; &quot;tesota&quot;), blue Palo Verde (&quot;Parkinsonia Florida&quot;), chuparosa (&quot;Justicia californica&quot;), spiny menodora (&quot;Menodora spinescens&quot;), desert senna (&quot;Cassia armata&quot;), California dalea (&quot;Psorothamnus arborescens&quot;), and goldenhead (&quot;Acamptopappus shockleyi&quot;). The Mojave Desert is generally abundant in winter annuals. The plants of the Mojave Desert each generally correspond to an individual geographic feature. As such, there are distinctive flora communities within the desert.

===Fauna===

Notable species of the Mojave Desert include bighorn sheep (&quot;Ovis canadensis&quot;), mountain lions (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), black-tailed jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;), and desert tortoises (&quot;Gopherus agassizii&quot;). Various other species are particularly common in the Mojave Desert, such as the LeConte&#x27;s thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma lecontei&quot;), banded gecko (&quot;Coleonyx variegatus&quot;), desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), chuckwalla (&quot;Sauromalus obesus&quot;), and regal horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma solare&quot;). Species of snake include the rosy boa (&quot;Lichanura trivirgata&quot;), Western patch-nosed snake (&quot;Salvadora hexalepis&quot;), and Mojave rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus scutulatus&quot;). These species can also occur in the neighboring Sonoran and Great Basin deserts.

The animal species of the Mojave Desert have generally fewer endemics than its flora. However, endemic fauna of the Mojave Desert include Kelso Dunes jerusalem cricket (&quot;Ammopelmatus kelsoensis),&quot; the Kelso Dunes shieldback katydid (&quot;Eremopedes kelsoensis&quot;), the Mohave ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus Mohavensis&quot;) and Amargosa vole (&quot;Microtus californicus scirpensis&quot;). The Mojave fringe-toed lizard (&quot;Uma Scopari&quot;a) is not endemic, but almost completely limited to the Mojave Desert. There are also aquatic species that are found nowhere else, such as the Devils Hole pupfish, limited to one hot spring near Death Valley.

== In society ==

=== History ===
Before the European colonization of North America, tribes of Native Americans, such as the Mohave, were hunter-gatherers living in the Mojave Desert.

European explorers started exploring the deserts beginning in the 18th century. Francisco Garcés, a Franciscan friar, was the first explorer of the Mojave Desert in 1776. Garcés recorded information about the original inhabitants of the deserts.

Later, as American interests expanded into California, American explorers started probing the California deserts. Jedediah Smith traveled through the Mojave Desert in 1826, finally reaching the San Gabriel Mission.

=== Human development ===

In recent years, human development in the Mojave Desert has become increasingly present. Human development at the major urban and suburban centers of Las Vegas and Los Angeles has had an increasingly damaging effect on the wildlife of the Mojave Desert. An added demand for landfill space as a result of the large metropolitan centers of Las Vegas and Los Angeles also has the real potential to drastically affect flora and fauna of the Mojave Desert. Agricultural development along the Colorado river, close to the Eastern boundary of the Mojave Desert, also causes habitat loss and degradation. Areas that are particularly affected by human development include Ward Valley and Riverside county. The United States military also maintains installations in the Mojave Desert, making the Mojave a critical training location for the United States Department of Defense. The Mojave Desert has long been a valuable resource for people, and as its human population grows, its importance will only grow. Miners, ranchers, and farmers rely on the desert for a living. The Mojave is also used by the state of California to meet renewable energy objectives. Large tracts of the desert are owned by federal agencies and are leased at low cost by wind and solar energy companies, although these renewable developments can cause their own environmental impact and disturb cultural landscapes and visual resources. Desert Sunlight Solar Farm, one of the largest solar farms in the world, was built approximately five miles from Joshua Tree National Park. An endangered Yuma clapper rail was found dead at the site in 2014, spurring efforts from conservation groups to protect birds from the so-called lake effect, a phenomenon in which birds can mistake the reflective glare of solar panels for a body of water.

=== Tourism ===

The Mojave Desert is one of the most popular spots for tourism in North America, primarily because of the international destination of Las Vegas. The Mojave is also known for its scenery, playing host to Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve. Lakes Mead, Mohave, and Havasu provide water sports recreation, and vast off-road areas entice off-road enthusiasts. The Mojave Desert also includes three California State Parks, the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, in Lancaster, Saddleback Butte State Park, in Hi Vista and Red Rock Canyon State Park. Mojave Narrows Park, operated by San Bernardino County, is a former ranch along the Mojave River.

Several attractions and natural features are in the Calico Mountains. Calico Ghost Town, in Yermo, is administered by San Bernardino County. The ghost town has several shops and attractions and inspired Walter Knott to build Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. The Bureau of Land Management also administers Rainbow Basin and Owl Canyon. 

=== Conservation status ===

The Mojave Desert has a relatively stable and intact conservation status. The Mojave Desert is one of the best protected distinct ecoregions in the United States, as a result of the California Desert Protection Act, which designated 69 wilderness areas and established Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve. However, the southwest and central east portions of the Mojave Desert are particularly threatened as a result of off-road vehicles, increasing recreational use, human development, and agricultural grazing. The World Wildlife Fund lists the Mojave Desert as relatively &quot;stable/intact&quot;.

Various habitats and regions of the Mojave Desert have been protected by statute. Notably, Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve by the California Desert Protection Act of 1994. (Pub.L. 103–433). Various other federal and state land agencies have protected regions within the Mojave Desert. These include Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, which protects the fields of California poppies, Mojave Trails National Monument, Desert Tortoise Natural Area, Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park, Desert National Wildlife Refuge, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Providence Mountains State Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, Red Rock Canyon State Park, Saddleback Butte State Park, Snow Canyon State Park and Valley of Fire State Park. In 2013, the Mojave Desert was further protected from development by the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP), in which the Bureau of Land Management designated 4.2 million acres of public land as protected wilderness as part of the National Conservation Lands of the California Desert.

=== Cultural significance ===
The Mojave Desert has served as a backdrop for a number of films. The 2010 video game &quot;&quot; takes place in the Mojave Desert, or &quot;Mojave Wasteland&quot; as it is known in its post-apocalyptic future. At least eight music videos were recorded in the Mojave Desert:
* &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; by the Spice Girls
* &quot;Goodbye&quot; by Mimi Webb
* &quot;Bodies&quot; by Robbie Williams
* &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot; by Soundgarden
* &quot;Breathless&quot; by The Corrs
* &quot;What Took You So Long?&quot; by Emma Bunton
* &quot;Desert Rose&quot; by Sting
* &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot; by Shania Twain

Photographs related to U2&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; were taken in the Mojave Desert.

<text>A construction foreman is the worker or skilled tradesperson who is in charge of a construction crew. This role is generally assumed by a senior worker who is seasoned and competent in their field, but also capable of project leadership (oversight and control over subordinate laborers). In a military context, a foreman is a non-commissioned officer.

==Duties and functions==
Normally the foreman is a construction worker with many years of experience in a particular trade who is charged with organizing the overall construction of a particular project for a particular general contractor. Typically the foreman is a person with specialist knowledge of a given trade who has moved into the position and is now focused on an overall management of their trade on the job site. They are responsible for providing proper documentation to their workers so they can proceed with tasks.

Specifically, a foreman may train employees under their supervision, ensure appropriate use of equipment by employees, communicate progress on the project to a supervisor and maintain the employee schedule. Foremen may also arrange for materials to be at the construction site and evaluate plans for each construction job.

This job is not to be confused with a project manager.

<doc id="239057" wikidata="Q1018174" url="?curid=239057" title="Butthole Surfers">
<text>Butthole Surfers are an American rock band formed in San Antonio, Texas, by singer Gibby Haynes and guitarist Paul Leary in 1981. The band has had numerous personnel changes, but its core lineup of Haynes, Leary, and drummer King Coffey has been consistent since 1983. Teresa Nervosa served as second drummer from 1983 to 1985, 1986 to 1989, and 2009. The band has also employed a variety of bass players, most notably Jeff Pinkus.

Emerging from the 1980s hardcore punk scene, Butthole Surfers quickly became known for their chaotic live shows, black comedy, and a sound that incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise rock, and punk as well as their use of sound manipulation and tape editing.

Although they were respected by their peers and attracted a devoted fanbase, Butthole Surfers had little commercial success until 1996&#x27;s &quot;Electriclarryland&quot;. The album contained the hit single &quot;Pepper&quot;, which climbed to number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart that year.

== History ==

=== Formation (1976–1981) ===
Butthole Surfers formed at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas during the late 1970s, when students Gibson &quot;Gibby&quot; Haynes and Paul Leary Walthall (later just Paul Leary) met for the first time. Though it was their shared taste in non-mainstream music that caused them to become friends, both appeared to be headed for very conventional careers. Haynes, as captain of Trinity&#x27;s basketball team, as well as the school&#x27;s &quot;Accountant of the Year&quot;, soon graduated to a position with a respected Texas accounting firm, while Leary remained in school working on his MBA degree.

In 1981, Haynes and Leary published the magazine &quot;Strange V.D.&quot;, which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous explanations for the diseases. After being caught with one of these pictures at work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, dropped out of college and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.

=== Early years (1981–1984) ===
Haynes and Leary played their debut show at a San Antonio night club, The Bonham Exchange, in 1981; at that time, they had not yet settled on the band name &quot;Butthole Surfers&quot;. By 1982, the band was backed by the sibling rhythm section composed of bassist Quinn Mathews and his brother, drummer Scott Mathews. The band did not gain a following in San Antonio, and purchased a van to return to California later that summer.

During a brief concert at the Tool and Die club in San Francisco, Dead Kennedys frontman and Alternative Tentacles overseer Jello Biafra witnessed their performance and became a fervent fan. Biafra invited the group to open for Dead Kennedys and T.S.O.L. at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, and soon made an offer that would launch their recording career; if they could get someone to lend them studio time, Alternative Tentacles would reimburse the studio when the album was complete. The band then returned to San Antonio to record at BOSS Studios (a.k.a. Bob O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Sound Studios, a.k.a. the Boss). However, the Mathews brothers did not enter the studio with Haynes and Leary; the two had quit following a physical altercation between Scott Mathews and Haynes. The bass position was taken over by Bill Jolly, who would play on Butthole Surfers&#x27; next two releases, and a number of drummers participated. The last of these, King Coffey (born Jeffrey Coffey), is still with the band to this day.

Released on Alternative Tentacles in July 1983, the resulting EP, &quot;Butthole Surfers&quot; (also known as &quot;Brown Reason to Live&quot; and &quot;Pee Pee the Sailor&quot;), offered songs with provocatively absurd titles like &quot;The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey&#x27;s Grave&quot; and &quot;Bar-B-Q Pope&quot;, alternately sung by Haynes and Leary. (Haynes would become the band&#x27;s primary singer by the time of their first LP.) The album cover, like the many bizarre illustrations that would accompany Surfers&#x27; succeeding work, was designed by the band itself. Teeming with humor, &quot;Butthole Surfers&quot; laid the foundation for what was to come. It influenced at least one future superstar in Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who listed it as one of his ten favorite albums in his &quot;Journals&quot;. Cobain later went on to list the album &quot;Pee Pee the Sailor&quot; by Butthole Surfers as one of the fifty most influential albums for Nirvana&#x27;s sound. Cobain would later meet his wife, Courtney Love of Hole, at a Butthole Surfers/L7 concert in 1991.

Soon after the release of &quot;Butthole Surfers&quot;, the band recruited a second drummer, Teresa Nervosa (born Teresa Taylor), who had played with Coffey in a number of high school marching bands in the Texas&#x27; Fort Worth and Austin areas. She and Coffey would drum in unison on separate, stand-up kits, adding to the spectacle of Surfers&#x27; ever-evolving stage show. Though Nervosa and Coffey repeatedly referred to themselves, and were referred to, as siblings, it has since been revealed that the two only presented themselves as such due to their similar appearances, and are not actually related. With her arrival, the band&#x27;s core &quot;classic lineup&quot;—Haynes, Leary, Coffey, and Nervosa—was in place. With the exception of a number of different bass players and Nervosa&#x27;s brief sabbatical from late 1985 to 1986, it remained largely unchanged until her final departure in 1989. In 2008, she returned to the band—their website announced 2009 tour dates including &quot;Teresa Taylor&quot;.

In 1984, the band returned to BOSS Studios to record enough material for two full-length albums. Both were originally offered to Alternative Tentacles, with the first being &quot;Psychic... Powerless... Another Man&#x27;s Sac&quot;. Before either album could be released, though, Alternative Tentacles had to acquire the master tapes from Bob O&#x27;Neill, BOSS Studios&#x27; namesake and owner. He refused to release them until he&#x27;d been reimbursed for the sessions, and Alternative Tentacles couldn&#x27;t immediately afford to pay. After months of waiting, the band issued the concert recording &quot;Live PCPPEP&quot; on Alternative Tentacles out of financial desperation in September 1984. Mostly made up of live performances of songs from their debut, it prompted some critics and fans to joke that they had released the same album twice. Meanwhile, Bob O&#x27;Neill was preparing to release &quot;Psychic...&quot; on his own Ward 9 label to recoup his expenses.

=== Legend grows (1984–1987) ===

With some members working as dishwashers, the group was unhappy about the album being released on Ward 9. Terry Tolkin, a friend and their East Coast booking agent, signed the band to Corey Rusk&#x27;s then-nascent Touch and Go Records in Detroit. &quot;Psychic...Powerless...Another Man&#x27;s Sac&quot; was released in 1984. Building on their first EP, the band made psychedelia a much bigger part of their sound on this release, which made full use of the tape editing, non-traditional instrumentation, and sound modulation that came to define their studio recordings.

Just before the release of &quot;Psychic...&quot;, and with new bassist Terence Smart in tow (the first of many through 1986), the band commenced their first nationwide tour. It was on this outing that they truly established a national presence, starting at Touch and Go&#x27;s early headquarters in Detroit before heading to New York City, where they impressed members of Sonic Youth, as well as Shockabilly member (and future Butthole Surfers bassist) Kramer. They then crisscrossed the country for several months, including a show in Seattle, that made a fan of future Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil. While in San Francisco at the end of the tour, and without a place to live, the band collectively decided to move to Winterville (a small town outside Athens, Georgia), where they admittedly made a hobby of stalking members of R.E.M. They purportedly planned to leave a van parked in front of Michael Stipe&#x27;s house, with &quot;Michael Stipe/Despite the Hype/I Still Wanna Suck/Your Big Long Pipe&quot; painted on the side. Smart quit after falling in love with a friend of the band, and Trevor Malcolm, a young Canadian musician recommended by Touch and Go, replaced him on bass.

Word was spreading about the band&#x27;s bizarre stage show by the time they hit the road again, resulting in ever-larger audiences at their concerts. Not long after Malcolm&#x27;s arrival, the band recorded their act for posterity by filming two concerts at Detroit&#x27;s Traxx club. Some of this footage was eventually packaged as &quot;Blind Eye Sees All&quot;, their only official video release to date. They purchased their first 8-track recorder at this time, and used it to record two songs later used on the A-side of &quot;Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis&quot;.

Reportedly unhappy with life in the band, Malcolm quit in mid-1985. A friend of the band&#x27;s from Athens, Juan Molina, was brought in for a brief U.S. tour, but was not interested in becoming a full-time member. Without a permanent bassist and a quickly approaching European tour looming—the band&#x27;s first—they contacted Kramer, who quickly agreed to join. Meanwhile, their second LP, which had been submitted to Alternative Tentacles as &quot;Rembrandt Pussy Horse&quot;, was still in limbo. The reasons for Alternative Tentacles&#x27; actions are unclear, but it is known that the label delayed a decision for about a year before ultimately refusing to publish it. While waiting, the band released the four-song &quot;Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis&quot; EP on Touch and Go in late 1985. Once Alternative Tentacles finally declined, the group went back into Kramer&#x27;s Noise New York studio to record two new tracks to replace &quot;To Parter&quot; and &quot;Tornadoes&quot;, which were originally intended for &quot;Rembrandt...&quot; before appearing on the &quot;Cream Corn...&quot; EP&#x27;s B-side.

Following the European tour, Butthole Surfers experienced more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, as she was tired of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be with family. She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers&#x27; infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by Jeff Pinkus, who gave the band&#x27;s bass position its longest period of stability by staying until 1994.

Their second LP was finally issued as &quot;Rembrandt Pussyhorse&quot; on Touch and Go in April 1986. Coming out some two years after the original sessions, it featured a different mix and song selection than Alternative Tentacles&#x27; unreleased version. Best known for its minimalist reworking of The Guess Who&#x27;s &quot;American Woman&quot;, it is one of the most experimental albums in Butthole Surfers&#x27; heavily experimental career. Following a particularly out-of-control tour, even by Butthole Surfers&#x27; standards, the band semi-settled in Winterville in the summer of 1986. Nervosa rejoined them (Cabbage having been fired months earlier), and they went to work on crafting their first home studio in a rental house on the outskirts of Athens. Before long, they started a leisurely recording session for their third full-length project. Released in March 1987, &quot;Locust Abortion Technician&quot; is one of the heaviest Butthole Surfers albums, and it is often considered their finest to date. Harnessing aspects of punk, heavy metal, and psychedelia, its unique sound produced a number of grinding, slower-paced songs, arguably making it an early precursor of grunge.

=== Evolution (1987–1991) ===

Around the time of &quot;Locust Abortion Technician&quot;&#x27;s debut, the group bought a home in Driftwood, Texas, approximately outside Austin. It was a ranch house built into the side of a hill, with of surrounding property. As with the rental home near Athens, the compound was turned into a &quot;de facto&quot; recording studio. They did not live together in the new house for long, though, with Coffey being the first to move out and get his own place. They all had separate residences by 1991.

In early 1988, Butthole Surfers were ready to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, choosing a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album&#x27;s blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.

&quot;Hairway to Steven&quot; was issued in April and marked a midway point between the band&#x27;s experimental roots and the more accessible recordings that would follow. While half of the material is as extreme sounding as their earlier work, other songs are more conventional. This was the first Butthole Surfers album to make extensive use of acoustic guitar. &quot;Hairway to Steven&quot; did not have song titles when first released and instead represented each track with an absurdist, often scatological, cartoon. The band traveled widely in support of the album over the next year, including a very successful tour of Europe (helped in part by the influence of new UK distributor Blast First). Like their studio recordings, their live shows were beginning to lose much of their earlier chaos.

While touring during the winter of 1988, Butthole Surfers used a portable DAT recorder to tape various concerts. The strongest of these recordings were packaged as &quot;Double Live&quot;, a limited edition double album released on vinyl and cassette in 1989, and on CD the following year. This was the first release on the band&#x27;s Latino Buggerveil label. Although the album, as of spring 2007, is out of print, its songs are available as free MP3 downloads on the band&#x27;s official website. Issued in response to widespread, for-profit bootlegging of their live shows, it contained performances of songs from all of their previous studio albums and EPs.

&quot;Double Live&quot; was to be the last Butthole Surfers album to feature Nervosa, who left early in 1989. Shortly after leaving, she was diagnosed with an aneurysm, and was forced to undergo brain surgery. She further began to suffer from strobe light-induced seizures. In 1991, Nervosa (who has gone by Teresa Taylor since her retirement) had a small role in Richard Linklater&#x27;s film &quot;Slacker&quot;. She was employed at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired as recently as 1995.

Butthole Surfers did not seek to replace her at the time, and opted to continue as a quartet. Following a final EP for Touch and Go—1989&#x27;s &quot;Widowermaker&quot;—the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also brought them to Touch and Go, for a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP&#x27;s debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot;, which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued &quot;Digital Dump&quot; by The Jackofficers, Haynes and Pinkus&#x27;s psychedelic house music side project.

&quot;piouhgd&quot; (pronounced &quot;p.o.-ed&quot;, as in &quot;pissed off&quot;) was the band&#x27;s fifth full-length studio album, and their first for Rough Trade. Released in April 1991, it featured more electronic instrumentation, but was largely viewed as a disappointment in comparison to past recordings. Both Haynes and Leary have since expressed displeasure with the album. Regardless, the band was invited to be part of that summer&#x27;s inaugural Lollapalooza tour. Around this time, Haynes collaborated with Ministry, contributing vocals on their 1991 single &quot;Jesus Built My Hotrod&quot;, which was later included on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs&quot;.

=== Mainstream recognition (1991–1999) ===
Rough Trade filed for bankruptcy in 1991, but not before releasing Leary&#x27;s solo project, &quot;The History of Dogs&quot;. The following year, Butthole Surfers shocked many fans and critics by signing with the major label Capitol Records. In 2017, Paul Leary reflected: &quot;I grew up listening to The Beatles and Grand Funk Railroad and Dean Martin, and the thought of being on the same record label that they were on was too fucking weird, really weird. A lot of people gave us grief for doing that, but fuck: I wasn&#x27;t going to turn that down.&quot;

Capitol immediately reissued &quot;piouhgd&quot; and paired the band with their first big-name producer, John Paul Jones, best known as the bassist for Led Zeppelin. The fruit of their partnership, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Independent Worm Saloon&quot;, featured a more straightforward rock approach at Jones&#x27;s insistence. This paid off for Butthole Surfers, giving them their first minor radio hit, &quot;Who Was in My Room Last Night?&quot;. It reached number 24 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks singles chart, while the album peaked at number 124 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Two of the new songs were featured on episodes of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. Guitarist and huge influence on Butthole Surfers, Helios Creed played guitar on two of the songs from the record, &quot;The Annoying Song&quot; and &quot;Clean It Up&quot;.

When Pinkus left in 1994, the remaining members enlisted a series of fill-in musicians, and continued to tour sporadically, even as all three pursued side projects. Haynes was working with Johnny Depp, Bill Carter, Sal Jenco, Flea, and others in a new group, P. In 1993, Haynes played with this band in Los Angeles&#x27; Viper Room, on the night the actor River Phoenix died of a drug overdose. Meanwhile, Leary was building a reputation as a skilled music producer, while Coffey set up his own record label Trance Syndicate. According to Leary and industry insiders, Haynes was increasingly dependent on hard drugs at this time, although Haynes has downplayed their concerns.

In 1995, the band contributed a cover of the &quot;Underdog&quot; theme song to be included on the tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA. Later that year, Haynes&#x27;s side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey&#x27;s Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album. Titled &quot;The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt&quot;, it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991. In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with Touch and Go. At first, they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion. The case quickly became a fight for all ownership rights that dragged on for more than three years.

In 1996, Capitol released Butthole Surfers&#x27; &quot;Electriclarryland&quot;, which climbed to number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; the single &quot;Pepper&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. Their songs started appearing on the soundtracks of major Hollywood movies, including Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; and John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; Despite improved sales with their second Capitol album, the group&#x27;s relationship with the label was increasingly troubled. A planned 1998 project, &quot;After the Astronaut&quot;, was scrapped and Butthole Surfers acrimoniously split with their manager, Tom Bunch. In 1999, Butthole Surfers won their lawsuit against Touch and Go. Despite the outcome, several of Butthole Surfers&#x27; peers in the alternative music community, including Fugazi and Minor Threat lead singer Ian MacKaye, criticized them for having pursued the lawsuit. Haynes and others said they wouldn&#x27;t have initiated the proceedings if they felt Rusk&#x27;s dealings had been honorable. Rusk provided the band with indecipherable accounting statements. Rusk continued to insist his actions were honest even though the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found otherwise. With the case resolved, the band reissued &quot;Psychic... Powerless... Another Man&#x27;s Sac&quot;, &quot;Rembrandt Pussyhorse&quot; (with the &quot;Cream Corn...&quot; EP), &quot;Locust Abortion Technician&quot;, and &quot;Hairway to Steven&quot; on their Latino Buggerveil label.

=== Recent years (2000–present) ===

In 2000, the band hired Nathan Calhoun as bassist. Having resolved their dispute with Capitol, Butthole Surfers re-recorded most of &quot;After the Astronaut&quot;&#x27;s songs for &quot;Weird Revolution&quot;, on the Hollywood Records/Surfdog Records imprint. The album was released in August 2001, and reached number 130 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was their most electronic album to date and had a hip hop sound. The single &quot;The Shame of Life&quot; peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Since then, the group has released two compilations on Latino Buggerveil: 2002&#x27;s &quot;Humpty Dumpty LSD&quot; is a compilation of studio outtakes, while 2003&#x27;s &quot;Butthole Surfers/Live PCPPEP&quot;, combines their first two Alternative Tentacles EPs. In 2004, Haynes formed Gibby Haynes and His Problem, who released an eponymous album on Surfdog Records later that year. While promoting the side project, Haynes indicated that another Butthole Surfers studio album was likely, and remarked that it would be &quot;noisy&quot;. However, no release date has been announced.

The band reunited with Jeff Pinkus and Teresa Nervosa for a tour of the East Coast and Europe in Summer 2008 with the Paul Green School of Rock All Stars. It was the first time the reunited line up played together since 1989. The group performed at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival curated by Melvins and Mike Patton of Faith No More. The group&#x27;s appearance at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties led to a dispute with ATP founder and organizer Barry Hogan, who told a reporter for the Village Voice that Butthole Surfers (along with Killing Joke and The Black Lips) would never play the festival again. The reunited 1986-1989 &quot;classic&quot; lineup continued to tour into 2009, with stops in the United States and Canada.

In Austin, Texas, during their last scheduled show for the North American/Canada 2008–2009 tour on October 31, 2009, Haynes said &quot;We played our first show as the Butthole Surfers in Austin. And this may be our last.&quot; Haynes has not yet clarified this statement. Recently, Paul Leary and King Coffey have both stated that the band will tour again if they can pull off another album. Butthole Surfers played two shows in Austin at Scoot Inn during Halloween 2010. A report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that, even though Butthole Surfers had not released an album of new material since 2001, the &quot;songs are practically incidental to the spectacle&quot; after seeing them perform along with psychedelic band Lumerians in Brooklyn.

The line-up of Haynes, Leary, Pinkus, and Coffey did a 12-show tour of mostly western U.S. states and one appearance in Canada from August 26, 2011, to September 11, 2011.

As of 2016, the group are on hiatus, with Leary saying: &quot;I just don&#x27;t want to play live anymore. It&#x27;s not fun, I don&#x27;t like touring. That hour on stage is a whole lot of fun, but the other 23 hours off stage just fucking suck.&quot;

They performed at the Day for Night music festival in Houston, Texas, which ran December 17–18, 2016.

In an interview with &quot;The Quietus&quot; in March 2017, Leary talked about the group possibly making a new album, their first in 16 years: &quot;We&#x27;ve all been busy with our own separate things, and I&#x27;ve done a lot of producing in the past few years, and I&#x27;ve got to the point now where I feel like I&#x27;ve done doing that for a while, so it&#x27;s time to make a new Butthole Surfers album. Especially now that Trump is president, jeez! If there was ever a time for a Butthole Surfers album it&#x27;s fucking now. It just doesn&#x27;t get any weirder than that.&quot;

In March 2019, the band released a visual history coffee table book, &quot;Butthole Surfers: What Does Regret Mean?&quot;, with author Aaron Tanner.

== Name ==
The band did not begin as Butthole Surfers, although they did have a song of that title, possibly an early version of 1984&#x27;s &quot;Butthole Surfer&quot;. This changed at their first paid concert, when an announcer forgot what the band was called and used the song title for the group&#x27;s name. They decided to keep the moniker, and have largely been billed as such ever since. Prior to that, Butthole Surfers performed under a different name at every live show. Early aliases included The Dick Clark Five, Nine cm Worm Makes Own Food, The Vodka Family Winstons, Ashtray Babyheads, Ed Asner Is Gay, Fred Astaire&#x27;s Asshole, The Right to Eat Fred Astaire&#x27;s Asshole, The Inalienable Right to Eat Fred Astaire&#x27;s Asshole, Zipgun, and many others.

The name has long been a source of trouble for the band. Many clubs, newspapers, radio, and TV stations refuse to print or mention their full name, and instead opt to use &quot;B.H. Surfers&quot; or other abbreviations. In a 1996 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, when asked if he could go back and choose a more culturally acceptable name for the band, Haynes replied, &quot;I would name the band: I&#x27;m Going to Shit in Your Mother&#x27;s Vagina.&quot;

== Live performances ==

In the 1980s, Butthole Surfers earned a reputation for their disturbing live performances that were both decadent and violent. As a result, they began to attract a wide range of curiosity seekers within a few years of their debut, in addition to traditional fans of punk rock who had supported them from the beginning. A staged reproduction of the band&#x27;s live show was filmed for 1988&#x27;s &quot;Bar-B-Que Movie&quot;, a short Super 8 mm film movie directed by Alex Winter, who is best known as &quot;Bill S. Preston, Esq.&quot; from &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;. Bar-B-Que Movie is a spoof of 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;, and the film ends with a music video-style performance of the song &quot;Fast&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Fart Song&quot;), featuring Haynes, Leary, Coffey, Nervosa, and Jeff Pinkus, as well as dancer Kathleen Lynch. The track displayed many of the band&#x27;s stage gimmicks, such as the burning cymbal, strobe lights, films, and smoke.

By the time Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers&#x27; stage show had become more predictable, with previously random shockers being done at the same point in each night&#x27;s performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band&#x27;s sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes&#x27; burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.

=== Appearance ===
Lead vocalist and saxophonist Haynes (who sometimes sang through a bullhorn), guitarist Paul Leary, dual drummers Coffey and Nervosa (the latter briefly replaced by Cabbage), and whichever bassist happened to be filling in at the time, had a visual aspect. As with their music, their appearance was exceptionally non-conventional in the early days, including sideways mohawks, dreadlocks, unnaturally colored hair, and the like.

Known for taking the stage at early concerts with hundreds of clothespins attached to his hair and clothes, Haynes would often strip throughout a show until he was down to his underwear, or less, by the end. Other attire included flasher-style trench coats over his nakedness, ridiculously home-styled wigs and cross-dressing; often employing a skirt made of an American flag and a large &#x27;60s torpedo-style stuffed bra. At other times he would hide condoms full of stage blood in his clothes and repeatedly fall to the floor, appearing to bleed profusely. Some of Haynes&#x27; other favorite tricks involved throwing handfuls of photocopied cockroach images into the crowd, rolls and rolls of toilet paper tossed across the audience, as well as filling an inverted cymbal with lighter fluid, setting it (and sometimes his hand) on fire, and repeatedly hitting it with a mallet. As previously mentioned he would sing through almost anything that would alter his voice, including toilet paper rolls and megaphones early on, which eventually evolved into &quot;Gibby&#x27;s kit&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Gibbytronix&quot;, a rack of vocal effects stacked as high as he could reach, before which he would often stand for the majority of the show in later performances. He also often utilized various foot switches which would be used to activate certain vocal effects, and when thought to be dancing during some performances he would actually be stepping on his various pedals. Adding to the spectacle were Coffey and Nervosa, who played in unison on stand-up drum kits; behind which they would collapse onto the floor and out of eyeshot, to collect their breath and strength before rising just in time to play the next song. Finally, the whole band would often tear apart stuffed animals while on stage, throwing the stuffing through the air, creating a rather disturbing throbbing effect, caused by the stroboscopes that were always on.

In 1986, they first met Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady), who was then working at a strip club called Sex World in New York City. Though never an official member, she became Butthole Surfers&#x27; famous &quot;naked dancer&quot;, performing intermittently with them through 1989. One show in Washington, D.C., with GWAR saw Kathleen take the stage to dance in nothing but gold body paint and antique wooden snow shoes. At another particularly wild concert in 1986, Haynes and Lynch, by now completely bald, reportedly engaged in sexual intercourse while on stage, as Leary used a screwdriver to vandalize the club&#x27;s speakers. This came after only five songs, during which time Haynes had started a small fire.

=== Equipment ===
Butthole Surfers began to take the collection of visual equipment seriously following Coffey&#x27;s recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band&#x27;s propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies at the same time which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.
The films&#x27; subject matter were often as disturbing as the manner in which they were played; with images of accidents, nuclear explosions, meat processing, spiders and scorpions stalking prey, gory driver&#x27;s education films, and penis reconstruction surgery. Not all of the movies were horrific, and they often included nature, wildlife, and aquatic footage; as well as a color negative of a &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; episode.

<doc id="239059" wikidata="Q2588761" url="?curid=239059" title="Tradesperson">
<text>A tradesperson or tradesman/woman is a skilled worker that specialises in a particular trade. Tradespeople (tradesmen/women) usually gain their skills through work experience, on-the-job training, an apprenticeship program or formal education.

As opposed to a master craftsman or an artisan, a tradesperson (tradesman/woman) is not necessarily restricted to manual work.

==History==
In Victorian England, The terms &quot;skilled worker,&quot; &quot;craftsman,&quot; &quot;artisan,&quot; and &quot;tradesman&quot; were used in senses that overlap. All describe people with specialized training in the skills needed for a particular kind of work. Some of them produced goods that they sold from their own premises (e.g. bootmakers, saddlers, hatmakers, jewelers, glassblowers); others (e.g. typesetters, bookbinders, wheelwrights) were employed to do one part of the production in a business that required a variety of skilled workers. Still others were factory hands who had become experts in some complex part of the process and could command high wages and steady employment. Skilled workers in the building trades (e.g. carpenters, masons, plumbers, plasterers, glaziers, painters etc.) were also referred to by one or another of these terms.

One study of Caversham, New Zealand, at the turn of the century notes that a skilled trade was considered a trade that required an apprenticeship to entry. Skilled tradesmen worked either in traditional handicraft workshops or newer factories that emerged during the Industrial Revolution. Traditional handicraft roles included, for example: &quot;sail-maker, candle-maker, cooper, japanner, lapidary and taxidermist, canister-maker, furrier, cap-maker, dobbin-maker, french-polisher, baker, miller, brewer, confectioner, watch-maker, tinsmith, glazier, maltster, wood-turner, saddler, shipwright, scale-maker, engraver and cutler.&quot;

==Modern use and list of skilled trades==
Tradesmen/women are contrasted with laborers, agricultural workers, and professionals (those in the learned professions). Skilled tradesmen are distinguished:
* from &quot;laborers&quot; such as bus drivers, truck drivers, cleaning laborers, and landscapers in that the laborers &quot;rely heavily on physical exertion&quot; while those in the skilled trades rely on and are known for &quot;specific knowledge, skills, and abilities.&quot; Both types of work, however, are considered blue-collar. 
* from &quot;professionals&quot; in that the professionals require more education and have a higher duty of care and routinely make decisions &quot;on the basis of expertise and ability in complex situations where there may be no, or little, previous history.&quot;

==Earnings and social standing==
A British study found that, after taking student loan repayments into account, a higher apprenticeship (at level 5 in the national qualifications frameworks) delivered higher lifetime median earnings than a degree from a university outside the Russell Group. Despite this, polling for the report found that apprenticeships have a lower perceived value than bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

Data from the United States shows that vocational education can provide a respectable income at a lesser cost in time and money for training. Even ten years after graduation, there are many people with a certificate or associate degree who earn more money than those with a B.A.

The average taxable income for the top trades in Australia can be up to $100,000, while the average for all Australians is $85,800.

<text>Captain Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, (27 July 1882 – 21 May 1965) was an English aviation pioneer and aerospace engineer. The aircraft company he founded produced the Mosquito, which has been considered the most versatile warplane ever built, and his Comet was the first jet airliner to go into production.

== Early life ==
Born at Magdala House, Terriers, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, de Havilland was the second son of The Reverend Charles de Havilland (1854–1920) and his first wife, Alice Jeannette (née Saunders; 1854–1911). He was educated at Nuneaton Grammar School, St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford and the Crystal Palace School of Engineering (from 1900 to 1903).

Upon graduating from engineering training, de Havilland pursued a career in automotive engineering, building cars and motorcycles. He took an apprenticeship with engine manufacturers Willans &amp; Robinson of Rugby, after which he worked as a draughtsman for The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company Limited in Birmingham, a job from which he resigned after a year. He then spent two years working in the design office of Motor Omnibus Construction Company Limited in Walthamstow. While there he designed his first aero engine and had the first prototype made by Iris Motor Company of Willesden.

He married in 1909 and almost immediately embarked on the career of designing, building and flying aircraft to which he devoted the rest of his life.

== Aviation career ==


Built with money borrowed from his maternal grandfather, de Havilland&#x27;s first aircraft took two years to complete. Unfortunately, he crashed it during its first very short flight at Seven Barrows near Litchfield, Hampshire in December 1909. He built a fresh biplane, making his first flight in it from a meadow near Newbury in September 1910. A memorial plaque presently marks the event. Subsequent designs were even more successful: in 1912 he established a new British altitude record of 10,500 feet (3,200 m) in an aircraft of his design, the B.E.2. Geoffrey was the designer and his brother Hereward was the test pilot.

In December 1910, de Havilland joined HM Balloon Factory at Farnborough, which was to become the Royal Aircraft Factory. He sold his second aeroplane (which he had used to teach himself to fly) to his new employer for £400. It became the F.E.1, the first aircraft to bear an official Royal Aircraft Factory designation. For the next three years, de Havilland designed, or participated in the design of, a number of experimental types at the &quot;Factory&quot;. He was commissioned a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Royal Flying Corps on 2 September 1912, was appointed a reserve officer in the RFC on 24 November and was confirmed in his rank on 25 December.

In December 1913, de Havilland was appointed an inspector of aircraft for the Aeronautical Inspection Directorate. Unhappy at leaving design work, in May 1914 he was recruited to become the chief designer at Airco, in Hendon. He designed many aircraft for Airco, all designated by his initials, DH. Large numbers of de Havilland-designed aircraft were used during the First World War, flown by the Royal Flying Corps/Royal Air Force. De Havilland continued to serve in the RFC during the war.

On 5 August 1914, he was promoted to lieutenant and appointed a flying officer in the RFC from the same date. He was briefly stationed in Montrose on the east coast of Scotland as an officer on war duty. Flying a Blériot, he was to protect British shipping from German U-boats. After a few weeks, he was released from this duty and returned to Airco. However, he nominally remained in the service until the end of the war. On 30 April 1916, he was promoted to captain and appointed a flight commander.

His employer, Airco, was bought in early 1920 by armaments group Birmingham Small Arms Company but discovering it was less than worthless BSA shut down Airco in July 1920. With the help of former Airco owner George Holt Thomas he formed de Havilland Aircraft Company employing some former colleagues. Pleased and impressed by the aircraft they built for him, Alan Butler, thereafter company chairman, provided the capital to buy premises and then the airfield at Stag Lane Aerodrome, Edgware, where he and his colleagues designed and built a large number of aircraft, including the &quot;Moth&quot; family. One of his roles was as a test pilot for the company&#x27;s aircraft.

In 1928, the subsidiary company De Havilland Canada was created to build Moth aircraft in North America. When World War II arrived, production expanded to augment British aircraft factories, without any possible threat from enemy bombers. After the Second World War, De Havilland Canada went on to design and produce a number of indigenous types, some of which proved highly successful.

In 1933, the company moved to Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire.

In 1944, he bought out his friend and engine designer Frank Halfords&#x27;s consultancy firm, forming the de Havilland Engine Company with Halford as the head. Halford had previously designed a number of engines for de Havilland, including the de Havilland Gipsy and de Havilland Gipsy Major. Halford&#x27;s first gas turbine design entered production as the de Havilland Goblin powering de Havilland&#x27;s first jet, the Vampire.

De Havilland controlled the company until it was bought by the Hawker Siddeley Company in 1960. His financial backer, Alan Butler, remained a very involved chairman until he retired in 1950.

== Retirement and death ==
De Havilland retired from active involvement in his company in 1955, though remaining as president. He continued flying up to the age of 70 making his final flight in a DH85 Leopard Moth, G-ACMA. He died aged 82, of a cerebral haemorrhage, on 21 May 1965 at Watford Peace Memorial Hospital, Hertfordshire.

== Honours ==

De Havilland was made an OBE (Military Division) in the 1918 Birthday Honours, and was honoured with a CBE (Civil Division) in the 1934 Birthday Honours. He was decorated with the Air Force Cross (AFC) in the 1919 New Year Honours, in recognition of his service in the First World War. He was knighted in the 1944 New Year Honours, and was invested with his knighthood by George VI at Buckingham Palace on 15 February 1944. He was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM) in November 1962. He received numerous national and international gold and silver medals and honorary fellowships of learned and engineering societies, including the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club in 1947 and again in 1963.

In 1972 de Havilland was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

A statue of de Havilland was erected in July 1997 near the entrance to the College Lane campus of the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield. He was a benefactor of the university, having given land adjoining the A1 to Hertfordshire County Council in 1951 for its precursor, the Hatfield Technical College. The statue was unveiled by the Duke of Edinburgh. The De Havilland campus (also known as De Hav) at the university was also named in his honour.

== Family ==

The actresses Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine were de Havilland&#x27;s first cousins; his father, Charles, and their father, Walter, were half-brothers. His younger brother, Hereward de Havilland, was also a noted pioneer aviator and test pilot. Sir Anthony de Havilland (born 1969) is a direct descendent of James de Havilland (1553–1613) who migrated from Guernsey to Poole in Dorset and was granted the trade license for Poole.

In 1909, Geoffrey de Havilland married Louise Thomas, who had formerly been governess to de Havilland&#x27;s sisters. They had three sons, Peter, Geoffrey and John. Two of the sons died as test pilots in de Havilland aircraft. His youngest son, John, died in an air collision involving two Mosquitoes in the vicinity of St Albans in 1943.

Geoffrey Jr carried out the first flights of the Mosquito and Vampire and was killed in 1946 flying the jet-powered DH 108 Swallow while diving at or near the speed of sound. Louise suffered a nervous breakdown following these deaths and died in 1949. De Havilland remarried in 1951, to Joan Mary Frith (1900–1974). They remained married until his death.







== Posthumous publication ==

In 1975, de Havilland&#x27;s 1961 autobiography, &quot;Sky Fever&quot;, was republished by Peter and Anne de Havilland. It was originally published by Hamish Hamilton.

<doc id="239062" wikidata="Q4699061" url="?curid=239062" title="Airwaves (Badfinger album)">
<text>Airwaves is the eighth studio album released by British rock band Badfinger in 1979 on the Elektra label (a sister label to Warner Bros. Records, their previous label), the seventh album released that was credited to Badfinger. Anticipated as a comeback album for the group at the time, expectations were not quite realised, as the &quot;group&quot; now consisted of just the duo of Tom Evans and Joey Molland, accompanied by guitarist Joe Tansin and various session musicians.

== History ==

Following the &quot;hold&quot; placed on the last Badfinger album, &quot;Head First&quot;, and the suicide of group co-founder Pete Ham in 1975, Badfinger disbanded, and the remaining members joined various other groups or dropped out of music for the next two years.

At the behest of Chicago musicians Joe Tansin (guitar/vocals) and Kenny Harck (drums), the then-unemployed Joey Molland formed a new group with the duo in Los Angeles. Molland later enticed his fellow former Badfinger member Tom Evans to join the unnamed band.

After the band shopped demonstration records around the L.A. area, they discovered they would have more marketing power if they revived the Badfinger moniker. Although the name helped the group open doors to potential record labels, it also caused an inequality and friction between old and new Badfinger members within the band. As recordings commenced for the album, Harck was released by the band. Former Badfinger drummer Mike Gibbins auditioned for the group but was not hired, and session musician Andy Newmark was finally brought in for the drum tracks. Tansin, whose songs were largely bypassed during production in favour of Evans and Molland tunes, quit the group immediately upon the album&#x27;s completion.

With a short running time and basically only eight songs, &quot;Airwaves&quot; did not leave a strong impression on music reviewers upon its release. Critics also complained about the album&#x27;s &quot;West coast&quot; production and the loss of the famous Badfinger sound. Molland, however, has often defended the album and its production. The band toured frequently in support of the album, but sales figures failed to garner optimism with Elektra and the label passed on issuing a follow-up LP.

Two singles were released from the album. &quot;Lost Inside Your Love&quot; did not enter the US charts, &quot;Love Is Gonna Come at Last&quot; managed a peak position at number 69 on &quot;Billboard&quot;. The actual album peaked at number 125 on the US charts.

<doc id="239064" wikidata="Q628" url="?curid=239064" title="Bergamo">
<text>Bergamo (; ) is a city in the alpine Lombardy region of northern Italy, approximately northeast of Milan, and about from the alpine lakes Como and Iseo and 70 km (43 mi) from Garda and Maggiore. The Bergamo Alps () begin immediately north of the city. 

With a population of around 120,000, Bergamo is the fourth-largest city in Lombardy. Bergamo is the seat of the province of Bergamo, which counts more than 1,103,000 residents (2020). The metropolitan area of Bergamo extends beyond the administrative city limits, spanning over a densely urbanized area with slightly fewer than 500,000 inhabitants. The Bergamo metropolitan area is itself part of the broader Milan metropolitan area, home to more than 8 million people.

The city of Bergamo is composed of an old walled core, known as (&#x27;Upper Town&#x27;), nestled within a system of hills, and the modern expansion in the plains below. The upper town is encircled by massive Venetian defensive systems that are a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 9 July 2017. 

Bergamo is well connected to several cities in Italy, thanks to the motorway A4 stretching on the axis between Milan, Verona, and Venice. The city is served by Il Caravaggio International Airport, the third-busiest airport in Italy with 12.3 million passengers in 2017. Bergamo is the second most visited city in Lombardy after Milan.

==Toponymy==
In classical Latin, the toponym is attested as &quot;Bergomum&quot;, while in late Latin &quot;Bergame&quot;. The toponym in the local Bergamasque dialect of the Lombard language is instead &quot;Bèrghem&quot;. There are various hypotheses put forward to trace the origin of the name of the city.

Local historian and politician Bortolo Belotti compared the toponym to previous Celtic and pre-Celtic names, of which &quot;Bergomum&quot; would then only be the Latinisation; the word &quot;berg&quot; in Celtic means a protection, fortification or abode. In the writings of early Roman period, the toponym &quot;Bergomum&quot; appears to be associated with &quot;Bergimus&quot;, the Celtic god of mountains or dwellings. 

Historian Antonio Tiraboschi argued instead that the toponym stemmed from the Proto-Germanic language. The Bergamo toponym is similar to toponyms in various Germanic-speaking areas, and might be associated with *&quot;berg +*heim&quot;, or the &quot;mountain home&quot;. The hypothesis of a Germanic derivation clashes however with the absence of documents regarding Germanic settlements in the area prior to the settlement of the Lombards who settled in the northern part of the Italian peninsula after the collapse of the Roman Empire.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Bergomum (as it was known in classical Latin) was first settled by the Ligurian tribe of the Orobii, during the Iron Age period. During the Celtic invasion of northern Italy, around the year of 550 BC, the city was conquered by the Celtic tribe of Cenomani. 

In 49 BCE, it became a Roman municipality, containing inhabitants at its peak. An important hub on the military road between Friuli and Raetia, it was destroyed by Attila in the 5th century.

===Middle Ages===
From the 6th century, Bergamo was the seat of one of the most important Lombard duchies of northern Italy, together with Brescia, Trento, and Cividale del Friuli: its first Lombard duke was Wallaris.

After the conquest of the Lombard Kingdom by Charlemagne, it became the seat of a county under one Auteramus (died 816). An important Lombardic hoard dating from the 6th to 7th centuries was found in the vicinity of the city in the 19th century and is now in the British Museum.

From the 11th century onwards, Bergamo was an independent commune, taking part in the Lombard League which defeated Frederick I Barbarossa in 1165. The local Guelph and Ghibelline factions were the Colleoni and Suardi, respectively.

Feuding between the two initially caused the family of Omodeo Tasso to flee north , but he returned to Bergamo in the later 13th century to organize the city&#x27;s couriers: this would eventually lead to the Imperial Thurn und Taxis dynasty generally credited with organizing the first modern postal service.

===Early modern===
After a short period under the House of Malatesta starting from 1407, Bergamo was ceded in 1428 by the Duchy of Milan to the Republic of Venice in the context of the Wars in Lombardy and the aftermath of the 1427 Battle of Maclodio.

Despite the brief interlude granted by the Treaty of Lodi in 1454, the uneasy balance of power among the northern Italian states precipitated the Italian Wars, a series of conflicts from 1494 to 1559 that involved, at various times, also the Papal States, France, and the Holy Roman Empire.

The wars, which were both a result and cause of Venetian involvement in the power politics of mainland Italy, prompted Venice to assert its direct rule over its mainland domains.

As much of the fighting during the Italian Wars took place during sieges, increasing levels of fortification were adopted, using such new developments as detached bastions that could withstand sustained artillery fire.

The Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797) formally recognized the inclusion of Bergamo and other parts of northern Italy into the Cisalpine Republic, a &quot;sister republic&quot; of the French First Republic that was superseded in 1802 by the short-lived Napoleonic Italian Republic and in 1805 by the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.

===Late modern and contemporary===
At the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Bergamo was assigned to the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, a crown land of the Austrian Empire. The visit of Ferdinand I in 1838 coincided with the opening of the new boulevard stretching into the plains, leading to the railway station that was inaugurated in 1857. Austrian rule was at first welcomed, but later challenged by Italian independentist insurrections in 1848.

Giuseppe Garibaldi conquered Bergamo in 1859, during the Second Italian War of Independence. As a result, the city was incorporated into the newly founded Kingdom of Italy.

For its contribution to the Italian unification movement, Bergamo is also known as &quot;Città dei Mille&quot; (&#x27;City of the Thousand&#x27;), because a significant part of the rank-and-file supporting Giuseppe Garibaldi in his expedition against the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies came from Bergamo and its environs.

During the twentieth century, Bergamo became one of Italy&#x27;s most industrialized areas.

In 1907, Marcello Piacentini devised a new urban master plan that was implemented between 1912 and 1927, in a style reminiscent of Novecento Italiano and Modernist Rationalism.

The 2017 43rd G7 summit on agriculture was held in Bergamo, in the context of the broader international meeting organized in Taormina.

The &quot;Charter of Bergamo&quot; is an international commitment, signed during the summit, to reduce hunger worldwide by 2030, strengthen cooperation for agricultural development in Africa, and ensure price transparency.

In early 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, Bergamo&#x27;s healthcare system was overwhelmed by patients with COVID-19. There were reports of doctors confronted with ethical dilemmas with too few ICU beds and mechanical ventilation systems. Morgues were overwhelmed, and images of military trucks carrying the bodies of COVID-19 victims out of the city were shared worldwide. An investigative report by &quot;The New York Times&quot; found that faulty guidance and bureaucratic delays rendered the toll in Bergamo far worse than it had to be.

==Geography==

===Climate===
==Cityscape==
The town has two centres: &quot;Città Alta&quot; (&#x27;Upper City&#x27;), a hilltop medieval town, surrounded by 16th-century defensive walls, and the &quot;Città Bassa&quot; (&#x27;Lower City&#x27;). The two parts of the town are connected by funicular, roads, and footpaths.

===Upper city===
The upper city, surrounded by Venetian walls built in the 16th century, forms the historic centre of Bergamo.
Walking along the narrow medieval streets, you can visit numerous places of interest including:
*&quot;Cittadella&quot; (Citadel), built under the rule of the Visconti in the mid-14th century.
*&quot;Piazza Vecchia&quot;
*&quot;Palazzo della Ragione&quot;. This was the seat of the administration of the city in the medieval municipal period. Built in the 12th century, it was revamped in the late 16th century by Pietro Isabello. The façade has the Lion of Saint Mark over a mullioned window, testifying to the long period of Venetian rule. The atrium has a well-preserved 18th-century sundial.
*&quot;Palazzo Nuovo&quot; (Biblioteca Civica Angelo Mai). It was designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi in the early 17th century and completed in 1928.
*Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. It was built from 1137 on the site of a previous religious edifice of the 7th century. Construction continued until the 15th century. Of this first building the external Romanesque structure and the Greek cross plan remain. The interior was extensively modified in the 16th and 17th centuries. Noteworthy are the great Crucifix and the tomb of Gaetano Donizetti.
*&quot;Cappella Colleoni&quot;, annexed to Santa Maria Maggiore, is a masterwork of Renaissance architecture and decorative art. It contains the tomb of Bartolomeo Colleoni.
*&quot;Battistero&quot; (Baptistry), an elegant octagonal building dating from 1340.
*Bergamo Cathedral. It was built in the late 17th century with later modifications.
*&quot;Rocca&quot;. It was begun in 1331 on the hill of Sant&#x27;Eufemia by William of Castelbarco, vicar of John of Bohemia, and later completed by Azzone Visconti. A wider citadel was added, but is now partly lost.
*&quot;San Michele al Pozzo Bianco&quot;. Built in the 12th century, this church contains several frescoes from the 12th to the 16th centuries, including paintings by Lorenzo Lotto.
*&quot;Tempietto di Santa Croce&quot;. Small 12th century octagonal Romanesque chapel.
*&quot;Museo Civico Archeologico&quot;. It is housed in the Cittadella.
*&quot;Museo di Scienze Naturali Enrico Caffi&quot;. It is housed in the Cittadella.
*&quot;Orto Botanico di Bergamo &quot;Lorenzo Rota&quot;&quot; (botanical garden).
===Lower city===

The lower city is the modern centre of Bergamo. At the end of the 19th century, &quot;Città Bassa&quot; was composed of residential neighborhoods built along the main roads that linked Bergamo to the other cities of Lombardy. The main boroughs were Borgo Palazzo along the road to Brescia, Borgo San Leonardo along the road to Milan and Borgo Santa Caterina along the road to Serio Valley. Borgo Santa Caterina is one of (&#x27;The most beautiful villages of Italy&#x27;).

The city rapidly expanded during the 20th century. In the first decades, the municipality erected major buildings such as the new courthouse and various administrative offices in the lower part of Bergamo in order to create a new city center. After World War II, many residential buildings were constructed in the lower part of the city which are now divided into twenty-five neighborhoods:

*Boccaleone
*Borgo Palazzo
*Borgo Santa Caterina
*Campagnola
*Carnovali
*Celadina
*Centro-Papa Giovanni XXIII
*Centro-Pignolo
*Centro-Sant&#x27;Alessandro

<text>A plumber is a tradesperson who specializes in installing and maintaining systems used for potable (drinking) water, hot-water production, sewage and drainage in plumbing systems.

==History==

The origin of the word &quot;plumber&quot; dates from the Roman Empire. Roman roofs used lead in conduits and drain pipes and some were also covered with lead; lead was also used for piping and for making baths. The Latin for lead is &quot;&quot;. In medieval times, anyone who worked with lead was referred to as a plumber; this can be seen from an extract about workmen fixing a roof in Westminster Palace; they were referred to as plumbers: &quot;To Gilbert de Westminster, plumber, working about the roof of the pantry of the little hall, covering it with lead, and about various defects in the roof of the little hall&quot;.

==Plumbing activities ==

Years of training and/or experience are needed to become a skilled plumber; some jurisdictions also require that plumbers be licensed.

Common plumbing tasks and skills include:

* Reading drawings and specifications, to determine the layout of water supply, waste, and venting systems
* Detecting faults in plumbing appliances and systems, and correctly diagnosing their causes
* Installing, repairing and maintaining domestic, commercial, and industrial plumbing fixtures and systems
* Locating and marking positions for pipe connections, passage holes, and fixtures in walls and floors
* Measuring, cutting, bending, and threading pipes using hand and power tools or machines
* Joining pipes and fittings together using soldering techniques, compression fittings, threaded fittings, solvent weld, crimp and push-fit fittings.
* Testing pipes for leaks using air or water pressure gauges
* Paying attention, in all work undertaken, to legal regulations and safety issues
* Ensuring that all safety standards and building regulations are met.

=== Australia ===
Plumbing work is defined in the Australian Standards (AS3500) Regulations 2013 and refers to any operation, work or process in connection with installation, removal, demolition, replacement, alteration, maintenance or repair to the system of pipes and fixtures that conveys clean water into and liquid waste out of a building.

To become a licensed plumber a four year apprenticeship and a Certificate III in Plumbing is required. As part of this course, instruction in the basics of gas fitting will be undertaken. Upon completion, these basics in gas fitting will allow the plumber to not only apply for their plumbing license but also an interim gas license, and carry out gas work under the supervision of a fully qualified gas fitter.

To obtain a full gas license from the Department of Mines and Energy, the plumber will need to have worked on an interim gas license for a minimum period of twelve months and successfully completed a Certificate IV in Plumbing.

===Canada===
In Canada, licensing requirements differ by province; however, the provinces have pooled resources to develop an Interprovincial Program Guide that developed and now maintains apprenticeship training standards across all provinces. The Red Seal Program, formally known as the Interprovincial Standards Red Seal Program, is a program that sets common standards to assess the skills of tradespeople across Canada. The Red Seal, when affixed to a provincial or territorial trade certificate, indicates that a tradesperson has demonstrated the knowledge required for the national standard in that trade.

=== Colombia ===
Plumbing is not regulated in Colombia, so anyone can provide this service. Plumbers usually learn the trade because their families work in the construction industry, and they specialize in this field, but anyone can legally offer plumbing services. The most popular training institution for trades is SENA, a public school that provides high-quality education, though it is not mandatory.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, a four-year apprenticeship plus qualification exam was necessary for someone to practice professionally. Accreditation of businesses is of great help in order to show their credibility and experience in the job.

===United Kingdom===

National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) remained the main form of plumbing qualification until they were superseded in 2008 by the Qualification and Credit Framework (QCF) and then again, in 2015, into the National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom. The terms NVQ and SVQ (Scottish Vocational Qualification) are still widely used.

Plumbers in the United Kingdom are required to pass Level 2 and Level 3 vocational requirements of the City and Guilds of London Institute. There are several regulatory bodies in the United Kingdom providing accredited plumbing qualifications, including City and Guilds of London Institute and Pearson PLC.

===United States===

Each state and locality may have its own licensing and taxing schemes for plumbers. Some states license journeymen and master plumbers separately, while others license only master plumbers. To become licensed, plumbers must meet standards for training and experience, and in most cases, pass a certification exam. There is no federal law establishing licenses for plumbers.

== Dangers ==

There are many types of dangers to a plumber. These include electric shock, strains and sprains, cuts and lacerations, bruises and contusions, fractures, burns and scalds, foreign bodies in the eye, and hernias. Working at height or in confined spaces, or working with lead and asbestos are all on-site dangers that plumbers can face.

===Infectious disease risks===
Plumbers risk infections when dealing with human waste while repairing sewage systems. Microbes can be excreted in the faecal matter or vomit of the sufferer onto the toilet or sewage pipes. Human waste can contain infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, polio, cryptosporidiosis, ascariasis, and schistosomiasis.

==Other uses==
The term &quot;White House Plumbers&quot; was a popular name given to the covert White House Special Investigations Unit established on July 24, 1971, during the presidency of Richard Nixon. Their job was to plug intelligence &quot;leaks&quot; in the U.S. Government relating to the Vietnam War (i.e. the Pentagon Papers); hence the term &quot;plumbers&quot;.

<text>A welder is a person or equipment that fuses materials together. The term welder refers to the operator, the machine is referred to as the welding power supply. The materials to be joined can be metals (such as steel, aluminum, brass, stainless steel etc.) or varieties of plastic or polymer. Welders typically have to have good dexterity and attention to detail, as well as technical knowledge about the materials being joined and best practices in the field.

==Safety issues==
Welding, without the proper precautions appropriate for the process, can be a dangerous and unhealthy practice. However, with the use of new technology and proper protection, the risks of injury and death associated with welding can be greatly reduced. Because many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or a flame, the risk of burns is significant. To prevent them, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye in which ultraviolet light causes the inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Full face welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a faceplate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, opaque welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.

Welders are also often exposed to dangerous gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded metal arc welding produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides, which in some cases can lead to medical conditions like metal fume fever. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, many processes produce fumes and various gases, most commonly carbon dioxide and ozone, that can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Furthermore, because the use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes pose an explosion and fire risk, some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace. Welders with expertise in welding pressurized vessels, including submarine hulls, industrial boilers, and power plant heat exchangers and boilers, are generally referred to as boilermakers.

A lot of welders relate to getting small electrical shocks from their equipment. Occasionally, welders might work in damp crowded environments and they consider it to be a &quot;part of the job.&quot; Welders can be shocked by faulty conditions in the welding circuit, or, from the work lead clamp, a grounded power tool that is on the bench (the workpiece or the electrode). All of these types of shocks come from the welding electrode terminal. Often these shocks are minor and are misdiagnosed as being an issue with a power tool or the power supply to the welder&#x27;s area. However, the more likely cause is from stray welding current which occurs when current from the welding cables leaks into the welder&#x27;s work area. Often this is not a serious problem, however, under the right circumstances, this can be fatal to the welder or anyone else inside the work area. When a welder feels a shock, they should take a minute to inspect the welding cables and ensure that they are clean and dry, and, that there are no cracks or gouges out of the rubber casing around the wire. These precautions may be life-saving to the welders.

<doc id="239076" wikidata="Q1992360" url="?curid=239076" title="Shielded metal arc welding">
<text>Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA or MMAW), flux shielded arc welding or informally as stick welding, is a manual arc welding process that uses a consumable electrode covered with a flux to lay the weld.

An electric current, in the form of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.

Because of the versatility of the process and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world&#x27;s first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.

==Development==
After the discovery of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, there was little development in electrical welding until Auguste de Méritens developed a carbon arc torch that was patented in 1881.

In 1885, Nikolay Benardos and Stanisław Olszewski developed carbon arc welding, obtaining American patents from 1887 showing a rudimentary electrode holder. In 1888, the consumable metal electrode was invented by Nikolay Slavyanov. Later in 1890, C. L. Coffin received for his arc welding method that utilized a metal electrode. The process, like SMAW, deposited melted electrode metal into the weld as filler.

Around 1900, Arthur Percy Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg released the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating to stabilize the arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, the development of an extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.

In 1945 Karl Kristian Masden described an automated variation of SMAW, now known as gravity welding. It briefly gained popularity in the 1960s after receiving publicity for its use in Japanese shipyards though today its applications are limited. Another little used variation of the process, known as firecracker welding, was developed around the same time by George Hafergut in Austria. In 1964 laser welding was developed in Bell Laboratory with the intention of using this technology as a communication tool. Due to the large force of energy coupled with the small area of focus, this laser became a powerful heat source for cutting and tooling.

==Operation==
To strike the electric arc, the electrode is brought into contact with the workpiece by a very light touch of the electrode to the base metal. The electrode is then pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble; if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece, the tip will likely stick to the metal, which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece, causing it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler as it travels from electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces the amount of time that the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator&#x27;s time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.

The actual welding technique utilized depends on the electrode, the composition of the workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed. Flat welds require the least operator skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.

Sloped, vertical or upside-down welding requires more operator skill, and often necessitates the use of an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool. However, this generally means that the electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing the time required to lay the weld.

===Quality===
The most common quality problems associated with SMAW include weld spatter, porosity, poor fusion, shallow penetration, and cracking.

Weld spatter, while not affecting the integrity of the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. Secondary finishing services are often required due to the aesthetic appearance caused by the occurrence of molten splatter. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.

Defects to weld strength make welds prone to cracking. Porosity of the weld bead can cause serious weakening and is often detectable only via advanced nondestructive testing methods. Porosity occurs when the gases produced by the weld flux insufficiently shield the molten weld metal. An overexposed weld bead absorbs nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen from the atmosphere; these gases form tiny voids in the weld bead and are released while the weld cools. Poor fusion also affects the strength of the weld and is often easily visible. This is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode. Shallow welds are weaker and can be mitigated by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current, or using a smaller electrode.

Other factors in cracking propensity include high content of carbon, alloy, or sulfur in the base material, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, workpieces should not be excessively constrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the workpieces (and specifically into the weld) as they expand and contract due to heating and cooling. As the weld cools and contracts, this residual stress can cause cracking in the weld.

===Safety===

SMAW welding, like other welding methods, can be a dangerous and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye or flash burn, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.

In addition, the vaporizing metal and flux materials expose welders to dangerous gases and particulate matter. The smoke produced contains particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, gases like carbon dioxide and ozone can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Some of the latest welding masks are fitted with an electric powered fan to help disperse harmful fumes.

===Application and materials===
Shielded metal arc welding is one of the world&#x27;s most popular welding processes, accounting for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and gas metal arc welding has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.

SMAW is often used to weld carbon steel, low and high alloy steel, stainless steel, cast iron, and ductile iron. While less popular for non-ferrous materials, it can be used on nickel and copper and their alloys and, in rare cases, on aluminium. The thickness of the material being welded is bounded on the low end primarily by the skill of the welder, but rarely does it drop below . No upper bound exists: with proper joint preparation and use of multiple passes, materials of virtually unlimited thicknesses can be joined. Furthermore, depending on the electrode used and the skill of the welder, SMAW can be used in any position.

==Equipment==

Shielded metal arc welding equipment typically consists of a constant current welding power supply and an electrode, with an electrode holder, a ground clamp, and welding cables (also known as welding leads) connecting the two. 

===Power supply===
The power supply used in SMAW has constant current output, ensuring that the current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.
The preferred polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily upon the electrode being used and the desired properties of the weld. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) causes heat to build up in the parent material, increasing the electrode melting rate and decreasing the depth of the weld. Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and penetration.

Typically, the equipment used for SMAW consists of a step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45 V at currents up to 600 A. A number of different types of transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.

Electrical generators and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, but because of lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also tends to be more difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.

In some units the alternator is essentially the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60 Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400 Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.

===Electrode===

The choice of electrode for SMAW depends on a number of factors, including the weld material, welding position and the desired weld properties. The electrode is coated in a metal mixture called flux, which gives off gases as it decomposes to prevent weld contamination, introduces deoxidizers to purify the weld, causes weld-protecting slag to form, improves the arc stability, and provides alloying elements to improve the weld quality. Electrodes can be divided into three groups—those designed to melt quickly are called &quot;fast-fill&quot; electrodes, those designed to solidify quickly are called &quot;fast-freeze&quot; electrodes, and intermediate electrodes go by the name &quot;fill-freeze&quot; or &quot;fast-follow&quot; electrodes. Fast-fill electrodes are designed to melt quickly so that the welding speed can be maximized, while fast-freeze electrodes supply filler metal that solidifies quickly, making welding in a variety of positions possible by preventing the weld pool from shifting significantly before solidifying.

The composition of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical to that of the base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions similar to those of the base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.

Electrode coatings can consist of a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases the rate at which the electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.

To identify different electrodes, the American Welding Society established a system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix &quot;E&quot;, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand pounds per square inch (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.

Common electrodes include the E6010, a fast-freeze, all-position electrode with a minimum tensile strength of which is operated using DCEP, and provides deep weld penetration with a forceful arc capable of burning through light rust or oxides on the workpiece. E6011 is similar except its flux coating allows it to be used with alternating current in addition to DCEP. E7024 is a fast-fill electrode, used primarily to make flat or horizontal fillet welds using AC, DCEN, or DCEP. Examples of fill-freeze electrodes are the E6012, E6013, and E7014, all of which provide a compromise between fast welding speeds and all-position welding.

===Process variations===
Though SMAW is almost exclusively a manual arc welding process, one notable process variation exists, known as gravity welding or gravity arc welding. It serves as an automated version of the traditional shielded metal arc welding process, employing an electrode holder attached to an inclined bar along the length of the weld. Once started, the process continues until the electrode is spent, allowing the operator to manage multiple gravity welding systems. The electrodes employed (often E6027 or E7024) are coated heavily in flux, and are typically in length and about thick. As in manual SMAW, a constant current welding power supply is used, with either negative polarity direct current or alternating current. Due to a rise in the use of semiautomatic welding processes such as flux-cored arc welding, the popularity of gravity welding has fallen as its economic advantage over such methods is often minimal. Other SMAW-related methods that are even less frequently used include firecracker welding, an automatic method for making butt and fillet welds, and massive electrode welding, a process for welding large components or structures that can deposit up to of weld metal per hour.

<doc id="239086" wikidata="Q18428" url="?curid=239086" title="Amarcord">
<text>Amarcord () is a 1973 comedy-drama film directed by Federico Fellini, a semi-autobiographical tale about Titta, an adolescent boy growing up among an eccentric cast of characters in the village of Borgo San Giuliano (situated near the ancient walls of Rimini) in 1930s Fascist Italy.

The film&#x27;s title is a univerbation (multiple words combined to form a single word) of the Romagnol phrase (), &#x27;I remember&#x27;. Fellini elaborated further by suggesting that the Italian words (&#x27;to love&#x27;), (&#x27;heart&#x27;), (&#x27;to remember&#x27;) and (&#x27;bitter&#x27;) could be expressed simultaneously through the Romagnol word. The title then became a neologism of the Italian language, with the meaning of &#x27;nostalgic revocation&#x27;, &#x27;fond memory&#x27;. 

The central role of Titta is based on Fellini&#x27;s childhood friend from Rimini, Luigi Titta Benzi. Benzi became a lawyer and remained in close contact with Fellini throughout his life. Titta&#x27;s sentimental education is emblematic of Italy&#x27;s &quot;lapse of conscience&quot;. Fellini skewers Mussolini&#x27;s ludicrous posturings and those of a Catholic Church that &quot;imprisoned Italians in a perpetual adolescence&quot; by mocking himself and his fellow villagers in comic scenes that underline their incapacity to adopt genuine moral responsibility or outgrow foolish sexual fantasies.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and was nominated for two more Academy Awards: Best Director and Best Original Screenplay the following year.

In 2008, the film was included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage’s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that &quot;have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.&quot;

==Plot==
In Borgo San Giuliano, a village near Rimini, the arrival of fluffy poplar seeds floating on the wind heralds the arrival of spring. As night falls, the inhabitants make their way to the village square for the , a traditional bonfire in which the , an effigy of an old woman, is ritually burned. The townspeople play pranks on one another, explode fireworks, cavort with loose women and make lewd noises when the civically minded lawyer lectures on the history of the region.

School under Fascism is a tedious cavalcade of dry facts recited by instructors of varying levels of engagement and skill. All Titta and his fellow students can do is goof off or skip class when not called upon to solve math problems or identify obscure historical details. When Titta goes to confession, he manages to avoid telling Don Balosa about his masturbatory activities and attempt to seduce Gradisca, a glamorous older woman, because the priest is more concerned with floral arrangements.

Fascist officials come for a tour, and the schoolchildren are required to perform athletic routines for their approval. Titta&#x27;s friend Ciccio daydreams about being married to his crush, Aldina, by a giant papier-mâché rendering of Mussolini&#x27;s face. Surreptitiously wired into the bell tower of the town church, a gramophone plays a recording of &quot;The Internationale&quot;, but it is soon shot at and destroyed by gun-crazy Fascists. Owing to his anarchist past, Titta&#x27;s father Aurelio is brought in for questioning and forced to drink castor oil. He limps home in a nauseous state to be washed by his wife, Miranda.

One summer afternoon, the family visits Uncle Teo, Aurelio&#x27;s brother, confined to an insane asylum. They take him out for a day in the country, but he escapes into a tree, repeatedly yelling, &quot;Voglio una donna!&quot; (&quot;I want a woman!&quot;). All attempts to bring him down are met with stones that Teo carries in his pockets. A dwarf nun and two orderlies finally arrive on the scene. Marching up the ladder, the nun reprimands Teo, who obediently agrees to return to the asylum.

Fall arrives. The town&#x27;s inhabitants embark in small boats to meet the passage of the SS &quot;Rex&quot;, the regime&#x27;s proudest technological achievement. By midnight they have fallen asleep waiting for its arrival. Awakened by a foghorn, they watch in awe as the liner sails past, capsizing their boats in its wake. Titta&#x27;s grandfather wanders lost in a disorienting fog so thick it seems to smother the house and the autumnal landscape. Walking out to the town&#x27;s Grand Hotel, Titta and his friends find it boarded up. Like zombies, they waltz on the terrace with imaginary female partners enveloped in the fog.

The annual car race provides the occasion for Titta to daydream of winning the grand prize, Gradisca. One evening he visits the buxom tobacconist at closing time. She becomes aroused when he demonstrates he is strong enough to lift her, but is annoyed when he becomes overwhelmed as she presses her breasts into his face. She gives him a cigarette then coldly sends him home.

Winter brings with it record snowfall. Miranda nurses a sick Titta to health, then as spring arrives again, dies of an illness herself. Titta is devastated. Later, the village attends the reception for Gradisca&#x27;s marriage to a Fascist officer. As Gradisca drives off with her &quot;Carabiniere&quot;, someone notices that Titta has gone too.

==Cast==
==Deleted scene==
A scene was shot that was later cut from the film by Fellini. The scene was shot without sound. It is described, however, in the novelization published by Rizzoli in 1973 and involves the contessa&#x27;s loss of a diamond ring down her toilet. Carlini, or &quot;Eau de cologne&quot;, the man who empties the town&#x27;s cesspits, is called to retrieve it. This scene is available on the Criterion release of the film.

Released in Italy on 18 December 1973, &quot;Amarcord&quot; was an &quot;unmitigated success&quot;. Critic Giovanni Grazzini, reviewing for the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, described Fellini as &quot;an artist at his peak&quot; and the film as the work of a mature, more refined director whose &quot;autobiographical content shows greater insight into historical fact and the reality of a generation. Almost all of &quot;Amarcord&quot; is a macabre dance against a cheerful background&quot;.

The film screened at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.

Russell Davies, British film critic and later a BBC radio host, compared the film to the work of Thornton Wilder and Dylan Thomas: &quot;The pattern is cyclic ... A year in the life of a coastal village, with due emphasis on the seasons, and the births, marriages and deaths. It is an &quot;Our Town&quot; or &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; of the Adriatic seaboard, concocted and displayed in the Roman film studios with the latter-day Fellini&#x27;s distaste for real stone and wind and sky. The people, however, are real, and the many non-actors among them come in all the shapes and sizes one cares to imagine without plunging too deep into Tod Browning freak territory.&quot;

Rapidly picked up for international distribution after winning an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1975, the film was destined to be Fellini&#x27;s &quot;last major commercial success&quot;. In 2008, the film was voted at number 50 on the list of the &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;.

===United States===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Amarcord&quot; holds an approval rating of 87%, based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Ribald, sweet, and sentimental, &quot;Amarcord&quot; is a larger-than-life journey through a seaside village and its colorful citizens.&quot;

When &quot;Amarcord&quot; opened in New York City, critic Vincent Canby lauded it as possibly &quot;Fellini&#x27;s most marvelous film ... It&#x27;s an extravagantly funny, sometimes dreamlike evocation of a year in the life of a small Italian coastal town in the nineteen-thirties, not as it literally was, perhaps, but as it is recalled by a director with a superstar&#x27;s access to the resources of the Italian film industry and a piper&#x27;s command over our imaginations. When Mr. Fellini is working in peak condition, as he is in &quot;Amarcord&quot; (the vernacular for &#x27;I remember&#x27; in Romagna), he somehow brings out the best in us. We become more humane, less stuffy, more appreciative of the profound importance of attitudes that in other circumstances would seem merely eccentric if not lunatic.&quot;

Rating the film four out of four stars, critic Roger Ebert discussed Fellini&#x27;s value as a director: &quot;It&#x27;s also absolutely breathtaking filmmaking. Fellini has ranked for a long time among the five or six greatest directors in the world, and of them all, he&#x27;s the natural. Ingmar Bergman achieves his greatness through thought and soul-searching, Alfred Hitchcock built his films with meticulous craftsmanship, and Luis Buñuel used his fetishes and fantasies to construct barbed jokes about humanity. But Fellini ... well, moviemaking for him seems almost effortless, like breathing, and he can orchestrate the most complicated scenes with purity and ease. He&#x27;s the Willie Mays of movies.&quot; Ebert ranked the film fourth on his &quot;10 Best Films of 1973&quot; list. He later included the film on his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. Jay Cocks of &quot;Time&quot; magazine considered it &quot;some of the finest work Fellini has ever done—which also means it stands with the best that anyone in film has ever achieved.&quot;

In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made, &quot;Amarcord&quot; was ranked 30th among directors.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
In 1984, &quot;Amarcord&quot; became the first film released for home video fully letterboxed, as implemented by RCA for their Capacitance Electronic Disc videodisc format. The film was later released on DVD twice by The Criterion Collection, first in 1998, then re-released in 2006 with an anamorphic widescreen transfer and additional supplements. Criterion re-issued the 2006 release on Blu-ray Disc in 2011.

<text>Parking is the act of stopping and disengaging a vehicle and usually leaving it unoccupied. Parking on one or both sides of a road is often permitted, though sometimes with restrictions. Some buildings have parking facilities for use of the buildings&#x27; users. Countries and local governments have rules for design and use of parking spaces.

Car parking is essential to car-based travel. Cars are typically stationary around 95 per cent of the time. The availability and price of car parking may support car dependency. Significant amounts of urban land are devoted to car parking; in many North American city centers, half or more of all land is devoted to car parking.

== Parking facilities ==


Parking facilities can be divided into public parking and private parking.

* Public parking is managed by local government authorities and available for all members of the public to drive to and park in. 
* Private parking is owned by a private entity. It may be available for use by the public or restricted to customers, employees or residents.

Such facilities may be on-street parking, located on the street, or off-street parking, located in a parking lot or parking garage.

=== On-street parking ===
On-street parking can come in the form of curbside or central parking.

Curbside parking may be parallel, angled or perpendicular parking. Parallel parking is often considered a complicated maneuver for drivers, however uses the least road width.

On-street parking can act as inexpensive traffic calming by reducing the effective width of the street.

On-street parking may be restricted for a number of reasons. Restrictions could include waiting prohibitions, which ban parking in certain areas; time restrictions; requirements to pay, e.g. at a Parking meter or using a pay by phone facility, or a permit zone, restricting parking to permit holders - often residents - only. Parking restrictions may be applied across a whole zone using a controlled parking zone or similar.

On-street parking is often criticised for being a bad use of high-value public space, especially where parking is free. In some cities, authorities have replaced parking spaces with Parklets.

=== Parking lots and garages ===
Parking lots (or car parks) generally come in either a structured or surface regime.

Structured regimes are buildings in which vehicles can be parked, including multi-storey parking garages, underground parking or a hybrid of the two. Such structures may be incorporated into a wider structure.

In the U.S., after the first public parking garage for motor vehicles was opened in Boston, May 24, 1898, livery stables in urban centers began to be converted into garages. In cities of the Eastern US, many former livery stables, with lifts for carriages, continue to operate as garages today.

Surface regimes involve using a clear lot to provide a single level of parking. This may be a stand-alone car park or located around a building.

There is a wide international vocabulary for multi-storey parking garages. In the Midwestern United States, they are known as parking ramp. In the United Kingdom, they are known as multi-storey car parks. In the Western US, they are called parking structures. In New Zealand, they are known as parking buildings. In Canada and South Africa, they are known as parkades.

=== Fringe parking ===
Fringe parking is an area designated for parking, typically located on the outskirts of a central business district (CBD) or just outside a city centre. It is primarily used by suburban residents who commute to urban areas for work, shopping, or other activities. 

These parking areas help reduce congestion in downtown areas by encouraging park-and-ride systems, where commuters leave their vehicles in fringe car parking lots and continue their journey using public transport, shuttles, or walking routes.

=== Park and ride ===

Park and ride is a concept of parking whereby people drive or cycle to a car park away from their destination and use public transport or another form of transport, such as bicycle hire schemes, to complete their journey. This is done to reduce the amount of traffic congestion and the need for parking in city centres and to connect more people to public transport networks who may not be otherwise.

=== Bicycle parking ===
Parking lots specifically for bicycles are becoming more prevalent in many countries. These may include bicycle parking racks and locks, as well as more modern technologies for security and convenience. For instance, one bicycle parking lot in Tokyo has an automated parking system.

Certain parking lots or garages may contain parking facilities for other vehicles, such as bicycle parking. Underneath Utrecht Central station, there is a three-storey underground bicycle park which can store 12,656 bicycles.

=== Types of parking ===
In addition to basic car parking, variations of serviced parking types exist. Common serviced parking types are:
* Carport (open-air single-level covered parking)
* Valet parking
* Meet and Greet Parking
* Park and Fly Parking
* Peer-to-peer shared parking

Parking spaces within car parks may be variously arranged.

== Economics ==

Parking is one of the most important Intermediate goods in the modern market economy. Early economic analysis treated parking only as an end-of-trip cost. However, later work has recognised that parking is a major use of land in any urban area. According to the International Parking Institute, &quot;parking is a $25 billion industry and plays a pivotal role in transportation, building design, quality of life and environmental issues&quot;. Annual parking revenue in the US alone is $10 billion.

In urban areas, car parks compete with each other and curbside parking spaces. Drivers do not want to walk far from where they have parked, giving car parks local monopoly power.

Urban parking spaces can have a high value where the price of land is high. The prices in Boston for parking spaces have always been high; in August 2020, the asking price ranged just under US$39,000 in the West End to almost $250,000 in the South End. According to Parkopedia&#x27;s 2019 Global Parking Index, the cost for 2 hours of parking in USD$ for the top 25 global cities is as follows:

In the graph to the right or below the value above the line represents the out-of-pocket cost per trip, per person for each mode of transportation; the value below the line shows subsidies, environmental impact, social and indirect costs. When cities charge market rates for on-street parking and municipal parking garages for motor vehicles, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled for these modes, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs compared to other modes of transportation. When municipal motor vehicle parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, the shortfall in tax expenditures by drivers, through fuel tax and other taxes might be regarded as a very large subsidy for automobile use: much greater than common subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.

=== Parking price elasticity ===

The average response in parking demand to a change in price (parking price elasticity) is -0.52 for commuting and -0.62 for non-commuting trips. Non-commuters also respond to parking fees by changing their parking duration if the price is per hour.

=== Performance parking ===

Donald C. Shoup in 2005 argued in his book, &quot;The High Cost of Free Parking&quot;, against the large-scale use of land and other resources in urban and suburban areas for motor vehicle parking. Shoup&#x27;s work has been popularized along with market-rate parking and performance parking, both of which raise and lower the price of metered street parking with the goal of reducing cruising for parking and double parking without overcharging for parking.

&quot;Performance parking&quot; or variable-rate parking is based on Shoup&#x27;s ideas. Electronic parking meters are used so that parking spaces in desirable locations and at desirable times are more expensive than less desirable locations. Other variations include rising rates based on duration of parking. More modern ideas use sensors and networked parking meters that &quot;bid up&quot; (or down) the price of parking automatically with the goal of keeping 85–90% of the spaces in use at any given time to ensure perpetual parking availability. These ideas have been implemented in Redwood City, California and are being implemented in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

One empirical study supports performance-based pricing by analyzing the block-level price elasticity of parking demand in the SFpark context. The study suggests that block-level elasticities vary so widely that urban planners and economists cannot accurately predict the response in parking demand to a given change in price. The public policy implication is that planners should utilize observed occupancy rates in order to adjust prices so that target occupancy rates are achieved. Effective implementation will require further experimentation with and assessment of the tâtonnement process.

==Geography==
The management of parking as a land use is an aspect of urban planning.

Municipal parking regulation introduced controls for parking on public land, often funded through parking meters. However, with the growth of car use, the supply of on-street parking became insufficient to meet demand. City centre merchants called on municipalities to subsidise car parking in the city centre to facilitate competition against new forms of car-centric commercial development.

Parking is a heavy land use. The total land area of parking in the US is at least the size of Massachusetts.

Off-street parking can be a temporary usage for a land owner to extract value from a vacant lot.

== Parking restrictions ==

During the winter of 2005 in Boston, the practice of some people saving convenient roadway for themselves became controversial. At that time, many Boston districts had an informal convention that if a person shoveled the snow out of a roadspace, that person could claim ownership of that space with a marker. However, city government defied that custom and cleared markers out of spaces. 

=== Parking minimums and maximums ===

In congested urban areas parking of motor vehicles is time-consuming and often expensive. Urban planners who are in a position to override market forces must consider whether and how to accommodate or &quot;demand manage&quot; potentially large numbers of motor vehicles in small geographic areas. Usually, the authorities set minimum, or more rarely maximum, numbers of motor vehicle parking spaces for new housing and commercial developments, and may also plan their location and distribution to influence their convenience and accessibility. The costs or subsidies of such parking accommodations can become a heated point in local politics. For example, in 2006 the San Francisco Board of Supervisors considered a controversial zoning plan to limit the number of motor vehicle parking spaces available in new residential developments.

Tradeable parking allowances have been proposed for dense residential areas to reduce inequity and increase urban livability. In summary, each resident would receive an annual, fractional allowance for on-street parking. To park on the street, one must assemble a whole parking allowance by purchasing fractional allowances from others who do not own cars.

==Parking by country==

=== Germany ===
German municipalities have variegated transport cultures and policies, however common federal laws govern the use of street space and the rights of motorists. German law privileges parked cars as traffic and constrains the ability of municipal governments to implement diverse parking policies.

German legal principles determine that the use of public streets is for traffic, including car parking. Consequently, German motorists tend to assert a right to park for free on the public highway.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, since 1962, to buy a car, one is required to obtain a &quot;garage certificate&quot; (&quot;shako shomeisho&quot;) from their local prefecture&#x27;s police, providing proof of their own off-street parking space that they either buy or rent, that is not located more than 2 kilometers from their place of residence. Kei cars can be exempted from parking space requirement in some sparsely-populated areas. Overnight street parking is not allowed.

=== United Kingdom ===
=== United States ===
In some jurisdictions, those in possession of the proper ID tags or license plates are also free from parking violation tickets for running over their metered time or parking in an inappropriate place, as some disabilities may prohibit the use of regular spaces. Illegally parking in a disabled parking space or fraudulent use of another person&#x27;s permit is heavily fined.

=== South Korea ===
====Shortage of parking lots====
In South Korea, there are many more vehicles than there are parking lots in the country, so parking lots are sometimes created as a way to utilize empty spaces where people are playing.

====Discount system====
There are not many compact cars in Korea, so the government is providing a lot of support for them, and the parking lot discount system for them is an example of that. 
*Full discounts on eco-friendly cars are also active.
*Electric &amp; Hydrogen &amp; Hybrid vehicles: 50% Off
*Compact cars: 50% to 60% off

As the number of users of large supermarket chain increased in Korea, the utilization rate of the traditional market sharply decreased. Accordingly, each local government has a large-scale parking lots near the traditional market and provides discounts to users.
*Traditional market users: 1 hour exemption &amp; 50% off additional 1 hour afterwards

The low birth rate problem in Korea is serious, and there is a lot of support for them.
*Multi-child households: 50% off
*Disabled person: 1 hour exemption / 50% off additional 1 hour afterwards
*Persons of national merit and persons eligible for veterans benefits: 1 hour exemption / 50% discount for additional 1 hour afterwards

==Parking at various destinations==

=== Hospitals ===

In England, NHS hospitals are permitted to charge patients, staff and visitors for parking at the hospital. This has been criticised for adding extra costs to accessing healthcare. In Scotland and Wales, all hospital parking charges have been abolished.

=== Airports ===

Most airports provide parking for patrons. Parking is normally split into short-stay parking, intended for those dropping off or picking up passengers, and long-stay parking, intended for staff and passengers who choose to drive to the airport. At larger airports, long-stay parking may be located further away from the terminal, while parking at the terminal will be more expensive. Some airports charge more for parking cars than for parking aircraft. Airports may be reluctant to discourage passengers from arriving at the airport by car due to the revenues generated.

At UK airports, it is rare for employees to pay for their car parking. Generally, the airports authority will charge for staff permits, but these permits will be purchased by employers and the cost not passed on to staff. Staff are generally more willing to park at a site away from the airport than passengers too.

==Statistics==

Parking Generation is a document produced by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) that assembles a vast array of parking demand observations predominately from the United States. It summarizes the amount of parking observed with various land uses at different times of the day/week/month/year including the peak parking demand. While it has been assailed by some planners for lack of data in urban settings, it stands as the single largest accumulation of actual parking demand data related to land use. Anyone can submit parking demand data for inclusion. The report is updated approximately every 5 to 10 years.

==Finding parking==

When the supply of kerbside parking in a particular area is less than the demand for parking, a phenomenon known as &quot;cruising&quot; occurs, where drivers drive on streets in search of a parking space. It can also occur where there is supply of kerbside space, but parking restriction or payment costs discourage drivers from parking there.

Cruising is an economic decision, with the cost of parking dominant in determining cruising behaviour. This is grounded in the principle that drivers will only cruise if the cost of cruising is lower than the savings of not parking in available chargeable spaces. Drivers are more likely to cruise if on-street parking is cheaper than off-street parking, the costs of fuel are cheap, the driver wishes to park for longer, the driver is alone in the car and the driver&#x27;s time is not valuable to them. Cruising can be diminished if the cost of on-street parking is set equal to the cost of off-street parking.

Automated Parking Guidance systems present drivers with dynamic information on parking within controlled areas (like parking garages and parking lots). The systems combine traffic monitoring, communication, processing and variable message sign technologies to provide the service.

Mobile apps and parking booking platforms that help drivers find parking take different approaches have emerged.

Some connected cars have mobile apps associated with the in-car system, that can locate the car or indicate the last place it was parked. Cars with Internavi communicate to each other indicating recently vacated spots.

San Francisco uses a system called SFpark, which has sensors embedded in the roadway. It allows drivers to find parking via mobile app, website, or SMS, and includes &quot;smart&quot; parking meters and garages that use variable pricing based on time and location to keep approximately 15% of parking spaces open.
Some South Boston spots also have sensors, so users of an app called Parker can find vacancies.

Ford Motor Company is developing a system called Parking Spotter, which allows vehicles to upload parking spot information into the cloud for other drivers to access.

Parking guidance and information system provides information about the availability of parking spaces within a controlled area. The systems may include vehicle detection sensors that can count the number of available spaces and display the information on various signs. There may be indicator lights that can lead drivers to an exact available spot.

An amusing alliterative slang term for finding an ideal parking spot directly in front of ones destination is &quot;Doris Day parking&quot; named for the American singer and actor who in numerous romantic comedy films was shown to immediately drive into the perfect spot time after time.

Statistically, the optimal strategy is to drive past the first empty spot and park in the next available spot.

<text>In chemistry, a halide (rarely halogenide) is a binary chemical compound, of which one part is a halogen atom and the other part is an element or radical that is less electronegative (or more electropositive) than the halogen, to make a fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, astatide, or theoretically tennesside compound. The alkali metals combine directly with halogens under appropriate conditions forming halides of the general formula, MX (X = F, Cl, Br or I). Many salts are halides; the &quot;hal-&quot; syllable in &quot;halide&quot; and &quot;halite&quot; reflects this correlation.

A halide ion is a halogen atom bearing a negative charge. The common halide anions are fluoride (), chloride (), bromide (), and iodide (). Such ions are present in many ionic halide salts. Halide minerals contain halides. All these halide anions are colorless. Halides also form covalent bonds, examples being colorless TiF4, colorless TiCl4, orange TiBr4, and brown TiI4. The heavier members TiCl4, TiBr4, TiI4 can be distilled readily because they are molecular. The outlier is TiF4, m.p. 284 °C, because it has a polymeric structure. Fluorides often differ from the heavier halides.

==Reactions==
===Redox===
Halides cannot be reduced under the usual laboratory conditions, but they all can be oxidized to the parent halogens, which are diatomic. Especially for iodide and less so for the lighter halides, intermediates can be observed and isolated. Best characterized is triiodide. Many related species are known, including a host of polyiodides.

===Protonation===
Halides are conjugate bases of hydrogen halides, which are all gases. When the protonation is conducted in aqueous solution, hydrohalic acids are produced.

===Reaction with silver ions===
Halide salts such as ,  and  are highly soluble in water to give colorless solutions. The solutions react readily with a solution of silver nitrate . These three halides form solid precipitates:
* : white
* : pale yellow
* : yellow
Similar but slower reactions occur with alkyl halides in place of alkali metal halides, as described in the Beilstein test.

==Uses==
Metal halides are used in high-intensity discharge lamps called metal halide lamps, such as those used in modern street lights. These are more energy-efficient than mercury-vapor lamps, and have much better colour rendition than orange high-pressure sodium lamps. Metal halide lamps are also commonly used in greenhouses or in rainy climates to supplement natural sunlight.

Silver halides are used in photographic films and papers. When the film is developed, the silver halides which have been exposed to light are reduced to metallic silver, forming an image.

Halides are also used in solder paste, commonly as a Cl or Br equivalent.

Synthetic organic chemistry often incorporates halogens into organohalide compounds.

<text>BitTorrent is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P), which enables users to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet in a decentralized manner. The protocol is developed and maintained by Rainberry, Inc., and was first released in 2001.

To send or receive files, users use a BitTorrent client on their Internet-connected computer, which are available for a variety of computing platforms and operating systems, including an official client. BitTorrent trackers provide a list of files available for transfer and allow the client to find peer users, known as &quot;seeds&quot;, who may transfer the files. BitTorrent downloading is considered to be faster than HTTP (&quot;direct downloading&quot;) and FTP due to the lack of a central server that could limit bandwidth.

BitTorrent is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, such as digital video files containing TV shows and video clips, or digital audio files. BitTorrent accounted for a third of all internet traffic in 2004, according to a study by Cachelogic. As recently as 2019 BitTorrent remained a significant file sharing protocol according to Sandvine, generating a substantial amount of Internet traffic, with 2.46% of downstream, and 27.58% of upstream traffic, although this share has declined significantly since then.

== History ==

Programmer Bram Cohen, a University at Buffalo alumnus, designed the protocol in April 2001, and released the first available version on 2 July 2001. Cohen and Ashwin Navin founded BitTorrent, Inc. (later renamed Rainberry, Inc.) to further develop the technology in 2004.

The first release of the BitTorrent client had no search engine and no peer exchange. Up until 2005, the only way to share files was by creating a small text file called a &quot;torrent&quot;, that they would upload to a torrent index site. The first uploader acted as a &quot;seed&quot;, and downloaders would initially connect as &quot;peers&quot;. Those who wish to download the file would download the torrent, which their client would use to connect to a tracker which had a list of the IP addresses of other seeds and peers in the swarm. Once a peer completed a download of the complete file, it could in turn function as a seed. These files contain metadata about the files to be shared and the trackers which keep track of the other seeds and peers.

In 2005, first Vuze and then the BitTorrent client introduced distributed tracking using distributed hash tables which allowed clients to exchange data on swarms directly without the need for a torrent file.

In 2006, peer exchange functionality was added allowing clients to add peers based on the data found on connected nodes.

In 2017, BitTorrent, Inc. released the BitTorrent v2 protocol specification. BitTorrent v2 is intended to work seamlessly with previous versions of the BitTorrent protocol. The main reason for the update was that the old cryptographic hash function, SHA-1, is no longer considered safe from malicious attacks by the developers, and as such, v2 uses SHA-256. To ensure backwards compatibility, the v2 .torrent file format supports a hybrid mode where the torrents are hashed through both the new method and the old method, with the intent that the files will be shared with peers on both v1 and v2 swarms. Another update to the specification is adding a hash tree to speed up time from adding a torrent to downloading files, and to allow more granular checks for file corruption. In addition, each file is now hashed individually, enabling files in the swarm to be deduplicated, so that if multiple torrents include the same files, but seeders are only seeding the file from some, downloaders of the other torrents can still download the file. In addition, file hashes can be displayed on tracker, torrent indexing services, to search for swarms by searching for hashes of files contained in them. These hashes are different from the usual SHA-256 hash of files and can be obtained using tools. Magnet links for v2 also support a hybrid mode to ensure support for legacy clients.

== Design ==
The BitTorrent protocol can be used to reduce the server and network impact of distributing large files. Rather than downloading a file from a single source server, the BitTorrent protocol allows users to join a &quot;swarm&quot; of hosts to upload and download from each other simultaneously. The protocol is an alternative to the older single source, multiple mirror sources technique for distributing data, and can work effectively over networks with lower bandwidth. Using the BitTorrent protocol, several basic computers, such as home computers, can replace large servers while efficiently distributing files to many recipients. This lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes in internet traffic in a given area, keeping internet speeds higher for all users in general, regardless of whether or not they use the BitTorrent protocol.

The file being distributed is divided into segments called &quot;pieces&quot;. As each peer receives a new piece of the file, it becomes a source (of that piece) for other peers, relieving the original seed from having to send that piece to every computer or user wishing a copy. With BitTorrent, the task of distributing the file is shared by those who want it; it is entirely possible for the seed to send only a single copy of the file itself and eventually distribute to an unlimited number of peers. Each piece is protected by a cryptographic hash contained in the torrent descriptor. This ensures that any modification of the piece can be reliably detected, and thus prevents both accidental and malicious modifications of any of the pieces received at other nodes. If a node starts with an authentic copy of the torrent descriptor, it can verify the authenticity of the entire file it receives.

Pieces are typically downloaded non-sequentially, and are rearranged into the correct order by the BitTorrent client, which monitors which pieces it needs, and which pieces it has and can upload to other peers. Pieces are of the same size throughout a single download (for example, a 10 MB file may be transmitted as ten 1 MB pieces or as forty 256 KB pieces).
Due to the nature of this approach, the download of any file can be halted at any time and be resumed at a later date, without the loss of previously downloaded information, which in turn makes BitTorrent particularly useful in the transfer of larger files. This also enables the client to seek out readily available pieces and download them immediately, rather than halting the download and waiting for the next (and possibly unavailable) piece in line, which typically reduces the overall time of the download. This eventual transition from peers to seeders determines the overall &quot;health&quot; of the file (as determined by the number of times a file is available in its complete form).

The distributed nature of BitTorrent can lead to a flood-like spreading of a file throughout many peer computer nodes. As more peers join the swarm, the likelihood of a successful download by any particular node increases. Relative to traditional Internet distribution schemes, this permits a significant reduction in the original distributor&#x27;s hardware and bandwidth resource costs. Distributed downloading protocols in general provide against system problems, reduce dependence on the original distributor, and provide sources for the file which are generally transient and therefore there is no single point of failure as in one way server-client transfers.

Though both ultimately transfer files over a network, a BitTorrent download differs from a one way server-client download (as is typical with an HTTP or FTP request, for example) in several fundamental ways:
* BitTorrent makes many small data requests over different IP connections to different machines, while server-client downloading is typically made via a single TCP connection to a single machine.
* BitTorrent downloads in a random or in a &quot;rarest-first&quot; approach that ensures high availability, while classic downloads are sequential.

Taken together, these differences allow BitTorrent to achieve much lower cost to the content provider, much higher redundancy, and much greater resistance to abuse or to &quot;flash crowds&quot; than regular server software. However, this protection, theoretically, comes at a cost: downloads can take time to rise to full speed because it may take time for enough peer connections to be established, and it may take time for a node to receive sufficient data to become an effective uploader. This contrasts with regular downloads (such as from an HTTP server, for example) that, while more vulnerable to overload and abuse, rise to full speed very quickly, and maintain this speed throughout. In the beginning, BitTorrent&#x27;s non-contiguous download methods made it harder to support &quot;streaming playback&quot;. In 2014, the client Popcorn Time allowed for streaming of BitTorrent video files. Since then, more and more clients are offering streaming options.

=== Searching ===
The BitTorrent protocol provides no way to index torrent files. As a result, a comparatively small number of websites have hosted a large majority of torrents, many linking to copyrighted works without the authorization of copyright holders, rendering those sites especially vulnerable to lawsuits. A BitTorrent index is a &quot;list of .torrent files, which typically includes descriptions&quot; and information about the torrent&#x27;s content. Several types of websites support the discovery and distribution of data on the BitTorrent network. Public torrent-hosting sites such as The Pirate Bay allow users to search and download from their collection of torrent files. Users can typically also upload torrent files for content they wish to distribute. Often, these sites also run BitTorrent trackers for their hosted torrent files, but these two functions are not mutually dependent: a torrent file could be hosted on one site and tracked by another unrelated site. Private host/tracker sites operate like public ones except that they may restrict access to registered users and may also keep track of the amount of data each user uploads and downloads, in an attempt to reduce &quot;leeching&quot;.

Web search engines allow the discovery of torrent files that are hosted and tracked on other sites; examples include The Pirate Bay and BTDigg. These sites allow the user to ask for content meeting specific criteria (such as containing a given word or phrase) and retrieve a list of links to torrent files matching those criteria. This list can often be sorted with respect to several criteria, relevance (seeders to leechers ratio) being one of the most popular and useful (due to the way the protocol behaves, the download bandwidth achievable is very sensitive to this value). Metasearch engines allow one to search several BitTorrent indices and search engines at once.

The Tribler BitTorrent client was among the first to incorporate built-in search capabilities. With Tribler, users can find .torrent files held by random peers and taste buddies. It adds such an ability to the BitTorrent protocol using a gossip protocol, somewhat similar to the eXeem network which was shut down in 2005. The software includes the ability to recommend content as well. After a dozen downloads, the Tribler software can roughly estimate the download taste of the user, and recommend additional content.

In May 2007, researchers at Cornell University published a paper proposing a new approach to searching a peer-to-peer network for inexact strings, which could replace the functionality of a central indexing site. A year later, the same team implemented the system as a plugin for Vuze called Cubit and published a follow-up paper reporting its success.

A somewhat similar facility but with a slightly different approach is provided by the BitComet client through its &quot;Torrent Exchange&quot; feature. Whenever two peers using BitComet (with Torrent Exchange enabled) connect to each other they exchange lists of all the torrents (name and info-hash) they have in the Torrent Share storage (torrent files which were previously downloaded and for which the user chose to enable sharing by Torrent Exchange). Thus each client builds up a list of all the torrents shared by the peers it connected to in the current session (or it can even maintain the list between sessions if instructed).

At any time the user can search into that Torrent Collection list for a certain torrent and sort the list by categories. When the user chooses to download a torrent from that list, the .torrent file is automatically searched for (by info-hash value) in the DHT Network and when found it is downloaded by the querying client which can subsequently create and initiate a downloading task.

=== Downloading and sharing ===
Users find a torrent of interest on a torrent index site or by using a search engine built into the client, download it, and open it with a BitTorrent client. The client connects to the tracker(s) or seeds specified in the torrent file, from which it receives a list of seeds and peers currently transferring pieces of the file(s). The client connects to those peers to obtain the various pieces. If the swarm contains only the initial seeder, the client connects directly to it, and begins to request pieces. Clients incorporate mechanisms to optimize their download and upload rates.

The effectiveness of this data exchange depends largely on the policies that clients use to determine to whom to send data. Clients may prefer to send data to peers that send data back to them (a &quot;tit for tat&quot; exchange scheme), which encourages fair trading. But strict policies often result in suboptimal situations, such as when newly joined peers are unable to receive any data because they do not have any pieces yet to trade themselves or when two peers with a good connection between them do not exchange data simply because neither of them takes the initiative. To counter these effects, the official BitTorrent client program uses a mechanism called &quot;optimistic unchoking&quot;, whereby the client reserves a portion of its available bandwidth for sending pieces to random peers (not necessarily known good partners, or &quot;preferred peers&quot;) in hopes of discovering even better partners and to ensure that newcomers get a chance to join the swarm.

Although &quot;swarming&quot; scales well to tolerate &quot;flash crowds&quot; for popular content, it is less useful for unpopular or niche market content. Peers arriving after the initial rush might find the content unavailable and need to wait for the arrival of a &quot;seed&quot; in order to complete their downloads. The seed arrival, in turn, may take long to happen (this is termed the &quot;seeder promotion problem&quot;). Since maintaining seeds for unpopular content entails high bandwidth and administrative costs, this runs counter to the goals of publishers that value BitTorrent as a cheap alternative to a client-server approach. This occurs on a huge scale; measurements have shown that 38% of all new torrents become unavailable within the first month. A strategy adopted by many publishers which significantly increases availability of unpopular content consists of bundling multiple files in a single swarm. More sophisticated solutions have also been proposed; generally, these use cross-torrent mechanisms through which multiple torrents can cooperate to better share content.

=== Creating and publishing ===

The peer distributing a data file treats the file as a number of identically sized pieces, usually with byte sizes of a power of 2, and typically between 32 KB and 16 MB each. The peer creates a hash for each piece, using the SHA-1 hash function, and records it in the torrent file. Pieces with sizes greater than 512 KB will reduce the size of a torrent file for a very large payload, but is claimed to reduce the efficiency of the protocol. When another peer later receives a particular piece, the hash of the piece is compared to the recorded hash to test that the piece is error-free. Peers that provide a complete file are called seeders, and the peer providing the initial copy is called the initial seeder. The exact information contained in the torrent file depends on the version of the BitTorrent protocol.

By convention, the name of a torrent file has the suffix codice_1. Torrent files use the Bencode file format, and contain an &quot;announce&quot; section, which specifies the URL of the tracker, and an &quot;info&quot; section, containing (suggested) names for the files, their lengths, the piece length used, and a SHA-1 hash code for each piece, all of which are used by clients to verify the integrity of the data they receive. Though SHA-1 has shown signs of cryptographic weakness, Bram Cohen did not initially consider the risk big enough for a backward incompatible change to, for example, SHA-3. As of BitTorrent v2 the hash function has been updated to SHA-256.

In the early days, torrent files were typically published to torrent index websites, and registered with at least one tracker. The tracker maintained lists of the clients currently connected to the swarm. Alternatively, in a &quot;trackerless system&quot; (decentralized tracking) every peer acts as a tracker. Azureus was the first BitTorrent client to implement such a system through the distributed hash table (DHT) method. An alternative and incompatible DHT system, known as Mainline DHT, was released in the Mainline BitTorrent client three weeks later (though it had been in development since 2002) and subsequently adopted by the μTorrent, Transmission, rTorrent, KTorrent, BitComet, and Deluge clients.

After the DHT was adopted, a &quot;private&quot; flag – analogous to the broadcast flag – was unofficially introduced, telling clients to restrict the use of decentralized tracking regardless of the user&#x27;s desires. The flag is intentionally placed in the info section of the torrent so that it cannot be disabled or removed without changing the identity of the torrent. The purpose of the flag is to prevent torrents from being shared with clients that do not have access to the tracker. The flag was requested for inclusion in the official specification in August 2008, but has not been accepted yet. Clients that have ignored the private flag were banned by many trackers, discouraging the practice.

=== Anonymity ===
BitTorrent does not, on its own, offer its users anonymity. One can usually see the IP addresses of all peers in a swarm in one&#x27;s own client or firewall program. This may expose users with insecure systems to attacks. In some countries, copyright organizations scrape lists of peers, and send takedown notices to the internet service provider of users participating in the swarms of files that are under copyright. In some jurisdictions, copyright holders may launch lawsuits against uploaders or downloaders for infringement, and police may arrest suspects in such cases.

Various means have been used to promote anonymity. For example, the BitTorrent client Tribler makes available a Tor-like onion network, optionally routing transfers through other peers to obscure which client has requested the data. The exit node would be visible to peers in a swarm, but the Tribler organization provides exit nodes. One advantage of Tribler is that clearnet torrents can be downloaded with only a small decrease in download speed from one &quot;hop&quot; of routing.

i2p provides a similar anonymity layer although in that case, one can only download torrents that have been uploaded to the i2p network. The bittorrent client Vuze allows users who are not concerned about anonymity to take clearnet torrents, and make them available on the i2p network.

Most BitTorrent clients are not designed to provide anonymity when used over Tor, and there is some debate as to whether torrenting over Tor acts as a drag on the network.
Private torrent trackers are usually invitation only, and require members to participate in uploading, but have the downside of a single centralized point of failure. Oink&#x27;s Pink Palace and What.cd are examples of private trackers which have been shut down.

Seedbox services download the torrent files first to the company&#x27;s servers, allowing the user to direct download the file from there. One&#x27;s IP address would be visible to the Seedbox provider, but not to third parties.

Virtual private networks encrypt transfers, and substitute a different IP address for the user&#x27;s, so that anyone monitoring a torrent swarm will only see that address.

== Associated technologies ==
=== Distributed trackers ===
On 2 May 2005, Azureus 2.3.0.0 (now known as Vuze) was released, utilizing a distributed database system. This system is a distributed hash table implementation which allows the client to use torrents that do not have a working BitTorrent tracker. A bootstrap server is instead utilized. The following month, BitTorrent, Inc. released version 4.2.0 of the Mainline BitTorrent client, which supported an alternative DHT implementation (popularly known as &quot;Mainline DHT&quot;, outlined in a draft on their website) that is incompatible with that of Azureus. In 2014, measurement showed concurrent users of Mainline DHT to be from 10 million to 25 million, with a daily churn of at least 10 million.

Current versions of the official BitTorrent client, μTorrent, BitComet, Transmission and BitSpirit all share compatibility with Mainline DHT. Both DHT implementations are based on Kademlia. As of version 3.0.5.0, Azureus also supports Mainline DHT in addition to its own distributed database through use of an optional application plugin. This potentially allows the Azureus/Vuze client to reach a bigger swarm.

Another idea that has surfaced in Vuze is that of &quot;virtual torrents&quot;. This idea is based on the distributed tracker approach and is used to describe some web resource. Currently, it is used for instant messaging. It is implemented using a special messaging protocol and requires an appropriate plugin. Anatomic P2P is another approach, which uses a decentralized network of nodes that route traffic to dynamic trackers. Most BitTorrent clients also use peer exchange (PEX) to gather peers in addition to trackers and DHT. Peer exchange checks with known peers to see if they know of any other peers. With the 3.0.5.0 release of Vuze, all major BitTorrent clients now have compatible peer exchange.

=== Web seeding ===
Web &quot;seeding&quot; was implemented in 2006 as the ability of BitTorrent clients to download torrent pieces from an HTTP source in addition to the &quot;swarm&quot;. The advantage of this feature is that a website may distribute a torrent for a particular file or batch of files and make those files available for download from that same web server; this can simplify long-term seeding and load balancing through the use of existing, cheap, web hosting setups. In theory, this would make using BitTorrent almost as easy for a web publisher as creating a direct HTTP download. In addition, it would allow the &quot;web seed&quot; to be disabled if the swarm becomes too popular while still allowing the file to be readily available. This feature has two distinct specifications, both of which are supported by Libtorrent and the 26+ clients that use it.

The first was created by John &quot;TheSHAD0W&quot; Hoffman, who created BitTornado. This first specification requires running a web service that serves content by info-hash and piece number, rather than filename.

The other specification is created by GetRight authors and can rely on a basic HTTP download space (using byte serving).

In September 2010, a new service named Burnbit was launched which generates a torrent from any URL using webseeding. There are server-side solutions that provide initial seeding of the file from the web server via standard BitTorrent protocol and when the number of external seeders reach a limit, they stop serving the file from the original source.

=== RSS feeds ===
A technique called broadcatching combines RSS feeds with the BitTorrent protocol to create a content delivery system, further simplifying and automating content distribution. Steve Gillmor explained the concept in a column for Ziff-Davis in December 2003. The discussion spread quickly among bloggers (Ernest Miller, Chris Pirillo, etc.). In an article entitled &quot;Broadcatching with BitTorrent&quot;, Scott Raymond explained:

The RSS feed will track the content, while BitTorrent ensures content integrity with cryptographic hashing of all data, so feed subscribers will receive uncorrupted content. One of the first and popular software clients (free and open source) for &quot;broadcatching&quot; is Miro. Other free software clients such as PenguinTV and KatchTV are also now supporting broadcatching. The BitTorrent web-service MoveDigital added the ability to make torrents available to any web application capable of parsing XML through its standard REST-based interface in 2006, though this has since been discontinued. Additionally, Torrenthut is developing a similar torrent API that will provide the same features, and help bring the torrent community to Web 2.0 standards. Alongside this release is a first PHP application built using the API called PEP, which will parse any Really Simple Syndication (RSS 2.0) feed and automatically create and seed a torrent for each enclosure found in that feed.

=== Throttling and encryption ===
Since BitTorrent makes up a large proportion of total traffic, some ISPs have chosen to &quot;throttle&quot; (slow down) BitTorrent transfers. For this reason, methods have been developed to disguise BitTorrent traffic in an attempt to thwart these efforts. Protocol header encrypt (PHE) and Message stream encryption/Protocol encryption (MSE/PE) are features of some BitTorrent clients that attempt to make BitTorrent hard to detect and throttle. As of November 2015, Vuze, BitComet, KTorrent, Transmission, Deluge, μTorrent, MooPolice, Halite, qBittorrent, rTorrent, and the latest official BitTorrent client (v6) support MSE/PE encryption.

In August 2007, Comcast was preventing BitTorrent seeding by monitoring and interfering with the communication between peers. Protection against these efforts is provided by proxying the client-tracker traffic via an encrypted tunnel to a point outside of the Comcast network. In 2008, Comcast called a &quot;truce&quot; with BitTorrent, Inc. with the intention of shaping traffic in a protocol-agnostic manner. Questions about the ethics and legality of Comcast&#x27;s behavior have led to renewed debate about net neutrality in the United States. In general, although encryption can make it difficult to determine &quot;what&quot; is being shared, BitTorrent is vulnerable to traffic analysis. Thus, even with MSE/PE, it may be possible for an ISP to recognize BitTorrent and also to determine that a system is no longer downloading but only uploading data, and terminate its connection by injecting TCP RST (reset flag) packets.

=== Multitrackers ===
Another unofficial feature is an extension to the BitTorrent metadata format proposed by John Hoffman and implemented by several indexing websites. It allows the use of multiple trackers per file, so if one tracker fails, others can continue to support file transfer. It is implemented in several clients, such as BitComet, BitTornado, BitTorrent, KTorrent, Transmission, Deluge, μTorrent, rtorrent, Vuze, and Frostwire. Trackers are placed in groups, or tiers, with a tracker randomly chosen from the top tier and tried, moving to the next tier if all the trackers in the top tier fail.

Torrents with multiple trackers can decrease the time it takes to download a file, but also have a few consequences:
* Poorly implemented clients may contact multiple trackers, leading to more overhead-traffic.
* Torrents from closed trackers suddenly become downloadable by non-members, as they can connect to a seed via an open tracker.

=== Peer selection ===
 BitTorrent, Inc. was working with Oversi on new Policy Discover Protocols that query the ISP for capabilities and network architecture information. Oversi&#x27;s ISP hosted NetEnhancer box is designed to &quot;improve peer selection&quot; by helping peers find local nodes, improving download speeds while reducing the loads into and out of the ISP&#x27;s network.

== Implementations ==
The BitTorrent specification is free to use and many clients are open source, so BitTorrent clients have been created for all common operating systems using a variety of programming languages. The official BitTorrent client, μTorrent, qBittorrent, Transmission, Vuze, and BitComet are some of the most popular clients.

Some BitTorrent implementations such as MLDonkey and Torrentflux are designed to run as servers. For example, this can be used to centralize file sharing on a single dedicated server which users share access to on the network. Server-oriented BitTorrent implementations can also be hosted by hosting providers at co-located facilities with high bandwidth Internet connectivity (e.g., a datacenter) which can provide dramatic speed benefits over using BitTorrent from a regular home broadband connection. Services such as ImageShack can download files on BitTorrent for the user, allowing them to download the entire file by HTTP once it is finished.

The Opera web browser supports BitTorrent natively. Brave web browser ships with an extension which supports WebTorrent, a BitTorrent-like protocol based on WebRTC instead of UDP and TCP. BitLet allowed users to download Torrents directly from their browser using a Java applet (until browsers removed support for Java applets). An increasing number of hardware devices are being made to support BitTorrent. These include routers and NAS devices containing BitTorrent-capable firmware like OpenWrt. Proprietary versions of the protocol which implement DRM, encryption, and authentication are found within managed clients such as Pando.

== Adoption ==
A growing number of individuals and organizations are using BitTorrent to distribute their own or licensed works (e.g. indie bands distributing digital files of their new songs). Independent adopters report that BitTorrent technology reduces demands on private networking hardware and bandwidth, an essential for non-profit groups with large amounts of internet traffic.

Many major open source and free software projects encourage BitTorrent as well as conventional downloads of their products (via HTTP, FTP etc.) to increase availability and to reduce load on their own servers, especially when dealing with larger files. In addition, some video game installers, especially those whose large size makes them difficult to host due to bandwidth limits, extremely frequent downloads, and unpredictable changes in network traffic, will distribute instead a specialized, stripped down BitTorrent client with enough functionality to download the game from the other running clients and the primary server (which is maintained in case not enough peers are available).

Some uses of BitTorrent for file sharing may violate laws in some jurisdictions (see legislation section).

=== Popularity and traffic statistics ===
, BitTorrent was utilized by 150 million active users. Based on this figure, the total number of monthly users could be estimated to more than a quarter of a billion (≈ 250 million). BitTorrent was responsible for 3.35% of all worldwide bandwidth—more than half of the 6% of total bandwidth dedicated to file sharing. , BitTorrent had 15–27 million concurrent users at any time.

=== Film, video, and music ===
* BitTorrent Inc. has obtained a number of licenses from Hollywood studios for distributing popular content from their websites.
* Sub Pop Records releases tracks and videos via BitTorrent Inc. to distribute its 1000+ albums. Babyshambles and The Libertines (both bands associated with Pete Doherty) have extensively used torrents to distribute hundreds of demos and live videos. US industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails frequently distributes albums via BitTorrent.
* Podcasting software has integrated BitTorrent to help podcasters deal with the download demands of their MP3 &quot;radio&quot; programs. Specifically, Juice and Miro (formerly known as Democracy Player) support automatic processing of .torrent files from RSS feeds. Similarly, some BitTorrent clients, such as μTorrent, are able to process web feeds and automatically download content found within them.
* DGM Live previously used BitTorrent to distribute music purchases.
* VODO was a platform for promoting and distributing freely licensed films. It used BitTorrent for distribution and encouraged downloaders to donate to content creators.

=== Broadcasters ===
* The CBC distributed the show &quot;Canada&#x27;s Next Great Prime Minister&quot; via BitTorrent after the broadcast, becoming the first major broadcaster in North America to do so.
* The NRK distributes a few past shows via BitTorrent.
* VPRO released CC-licensed documentaries in 2009 and 2010 via BitTorrent.

=== Cloud Service Providers ===
* Amazon S3 previously supported seeding public objects via the BitTorrent protocol.

=== Software ===
* Blizzard Entertainment previously distributed content and patches for &quot;Diablo III&quot;, &quot;StarCraft II&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; via BitTorrent.
* Wargaming uses BitTorrent in their popular titles &quot;World of Tanks&quot;, &quot;World of Warships&quot; and &quot;World of Warplanes&quot; to distribute game updates.
* Resilio Sync is a BitTorrent-based folder-syncing tool which can act as an alternative to server-based synchronisation services such as Dropbox.

=== Government ===
* The British government used BitTorrent to distribute details about how the tax money of British citizens was spent.

=== Education ===
* Florida State University uses BitTorrent to distribute large scientific data sets to its researchers.
* Many universities that have BOINC distributed computing projects have used the BitTorrent functionality of the client-server system to reduce the bandwidth costs of distributing the client-side applications used to process the scientific data. If a BOINC distributed computing application needs to be updated (or merely sent to a user), it can do so with little impact on the BOINC server.
* The developing Human Connectome Project uses BitTorrent to share their open dataset.
* Academic Torrents is a BitTorrent tracker for use by researchers in fields that need to share large datasets

=== Others ===
* Facebook uses BitTorrent to distribute updates to Facebook servers.
* Twitter uses BitTorrent to distribute updates to Twitter servers.
* The Internet Archive added BitTorrent to its file download options for over 1.3 million existing files, and all newly uploaded files, in August 2012. This method is the fastest means of downloading media from the Archive.

By early 2015, AT&amp;T estimated that BitTorrent accounted for 20% of all broadband traffic.

Routers that use network address translation (NAT) must maintain tables of source and destination IP addresses and ports. Because BitTorrent frequently contacts 20–30 servers per second, the NAT tables of some consumer-grade routers are rapidly filled. This is a known cause of some home routers ceasing to work correctly.

== Legislation ==
Although the protocol itself is legal, problems stem from using the protocol to traffic copyright infringing works, since BitTorrent is often used to download otherwise paid content, such as movies and video games. There has been much controversy over the use of BitTorrent trackers. BitTorrent metafiles themselves do not store file contents. Whether the publishers of BitTorrent metafiles violate copyrights by linking to copyrighted works without the authorization of copyright holders is controversial. Various jurisdictions have pursued legal action against websites that host BitTorrent trackers.

As a result the use of BitTorrent may sometimes be limited by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) due to legal or copyright grounds. Users may choose to run seedboxes or virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent these restrictions.

High-profile examples include the closing of Suprnova.org, TorrentSpy, LokiTorrent, BTJunkie, Mininova, Oink&#x27;s Pink Palace and What.cd. BitTorrent search engine The Pirate Bay torrent website, formed by a Swedish group, is noted for the &quot;legal&quot; section of its website in which letters and replies on the subject of alleged copyright infringements are publicly displayed. On 31 May 2006, The Pirate Bay&#x27;s servers in Sweden were raided by Swedish police on allegations by the MPAA of copyright infringement; however, the tracker was up and running again three days later. In the study used to value NBC Universal in its merger with Comcast, Envisional examined the 10,000 torrent swarms managed by PublicBT which had the most active downloaders. After excluding pornographic and unidentifiable content, it was found that only one swarm offered legitimate content.

In the United States, more than 200,000 lawsuits have been filed for copyright infringement on BitTorrent since 2010. In the United Kingdom, on 30 April 2012, the High Court of Justice ordered five ISPs to block The Pirate Bay.

== Security ==
One concern is the UDP flood attack. BitTorrent implementations often use μTP for their communication. To achieve high bandwidths, the underlying protocol used is UDP, which allows spoofing of source addresses of internet traffic. It has been possible to carry out denial-of-service attacks in a P2P lab environment, where users running BitTorrent clients act as amplifiers for an attack at another service. However this is not always an effective attack because ISPs can check if the source address is correct.

Several studies on BitTorrent found files available for download containing malware. In particular, one small sample indicated that 18% of all executable programs available for download contained malware. Another study claims that as much as 14.5% of BitTorrent downloads contain zero-day malware, and that BitTorrent was used as the distribution mechanism for 47% of all zero-day malware they have found.

<doc id="239101" wikidata="Q4303" url="?curid=239101" title="Autofellatio">
<text>Autofellatio is a form of masturbation involving the oral stimulation of one&#x27;s own penis. Only a limited number of males are physically capable of performing fellatio on themselves due to the flexibility required.

==History==
Egyptologist David Lorton says that many ancient texts refer to autofellatio within the religion of Egypt, both in the realm of the gods and among the followers performing religious rituals. According to Lorton, in the Papyrus Bremner-Rhind 28, 20–24, in a document called &quot;Book of Overthrowing Apophis&quot;, there is a poem narrating how the sun god Ra had created the god Shu and goddess Tefnut by fellating himself and spitting out his own semen onto the ground. In ancient Egyptian texts, this act is usually performed by the god Atum, and most texts depict only the spitting of the semen or only the masturbation, but not both.

Michel Foucault cites Artemidorus&#x27; &quot;Oneirocritica&quot; as identifying the act of &quot;taking [one&#x27;s] sex organ into one&#x27;s [own] mouth&quot; as one of three ways to commit &quot;relations with oneself.&quot; Artemidorus thought that dreams of this &quot;unnatural&quot; act portended the death of one&#x27;s children, loss of one&#x27;s mistresses, or extreme poverty.

==Physical aspects==
Few people possess sufficient flexibility and penis length to perform the necessary frontbend. However, increased flexibility achieved via gravity-assisted positions, and physical training such as gymnastics, contortion, or yoga may make it possible for some. American biologists Craig Bartle and Alfred Charles Kinsey reported that fewer than 1% of males can successfully orally contact their own penis and that only 2 or 3 men in a thousand could perform a full autofellatio. Previously, autofellatio was considered by behavioristic science a problem rather than as a variety in sexual practice.

==Health risks==
Risk factors are primarily related to muscle strain. In a &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; publication, sex counselor Eric Garrison says pulled muscles are not uncommon. Another sex counselor, Cam Fraser, in an ABC report: &quot;The only things that I could think of that could potentially go wrong could be if you&#x27;re not limbered up enough, maybe pulling a muscle and hurting your back.&quot; Both men remark that STIs, such as herpes, can be transferred from the mouth to penis, and vice versa. Additionally, Garrison has encountered a few cases of men accidentally biting themselves.

Autofellatio is a niche in pornography. While relatively few pornographic films involve autofellatio, some pornographic actors are noted for this skill, including Ron Jeremy for his 1970s examples on film. Other actors, including Scott O&#x27;Hara, Cole Youngblood, Steve Holmes, and Ricky Martinez, have also been featured performing autofellatio. In Brian W. Aldiss&#x27; 1970 semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Hand-Reared Boy&quot;, he describes group masturbation practices at a British boys&#x27; boarding school. One boy with an especially large penis is capable of fellating himself, a fact which the narrator, Horatio Stubbs, verifies.

Comedian Bill Hicks elaborated an oft-quoted riff on the subject of fellatio, &quot;A woman one night yelled out, &#x27;Yeah, you ever try it?&#x27; I said &#x27;Yeah. Almost broke my back. Kevin Smith later developed a similar theme (&quot;He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick&quot;) in his 1994 debut film &quot;Clerks&quot;. Writer/director Larry David, in his 1998 film &quot;Sour Grapes&quot;, used autofellatio as a recurring plot device with several mentions and muted shots of a lead actor fellating himself (back trouble allowing) throughout the movie. In a 26th season (2000–2001) &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch, Will Ferrell plays a character who joins a yoga class with the sole purpose of developing the ability to fellate himself as a part of reaching Samadhi. In the 2001 film &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;, Professor Dwight Hartman (David Cross) performs autofellatio after rebuffing Theo&#x27;s (Kathleen Robertson) offer to perform oral sex on him.

The opening sequence of the 2006 film &quot;Shortbus&quot; shows James (Paul Dawson) fellating himself on videotape; like all of &quot;Shortbus&quot;s sexual content, the scene was unsimulated.

In 1993, American feminist artist Kiki Smith created a beeswax life-size sculpture titled &quot;Mother/Child&quot; which included a depiction of a man performing autofellatio.

In 2017, the concept of autofellatio was employed by a former White House Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, towards other senior White House officials in Donald Trump&#x27;s administration:
&quot;I&#x27;m not Steve Bannon, I&#x27;m not trying to suck my own cock&quot;.

<text>A sleeping bag is an insulated covering for a person, essentially a lightweight quilt that can be closed with a zipper or similar means to form a tube, which functions as lightweight, portable bedding in situations where a person is sleeping outdoors (e.g. when camping, hiking, hill walking or climbing). It is also commonly used indoors for people who do not have beds or at sleepovers. Its primary purpose is to provide warmth and thermal insulation through its synthetic or down insulation. It also typically has a water-resistant or water-repellent cover that protects, to some extent, against wind chill and light precipitation, but a tent is usually used in addition to a sleeping bag, as it performs those functions better. The bottom surface also provides some cushioning, but a sleeping pad or camp cot is usually used in addition to that purpose. The bottom surface of a sleeping bag may be moderately water repellent, but a plastic tarp or groundsheet is often used to protect against moist ground.

There are a range of sleeping bag models designed for different purposes. Very lightly insulated sleeping bags are designed for summer camping use or indoor use by children during slumber parties. Well-insulated bags are designed for cold weather use. The most well-insulated and lightweight sleeping bags, which are designed for serious hikers and adventurers, are more expensive than lightly insulated sleeping bags. One subcategory of cold-weather sleeping bags, the mummy bag, is so named because it has an insulated hood for the head. A bivouac sack (&quot;bivy&quot;) is a waterproof cover for a sleeping bag that may be used in place of a tent by minimalist, experienced hikers. A bivy bag may also be carried by day hikers as a backup or emergency shelter, to be used if they cannot make it back to their starting point by nightfall due to inclement weather or getting lost.

==History==

In the 1850s, Elverys Sports in Ireland marketed a proto-sleeping bag known as the &quot;Crimea Wrapper&quot; towards soldiers being posted to the Crimean War.

The &quot;Euklisia Rug&quot;, from Ancient Greek εὖ (well) and κλισία (cot, sleeping-place), patented by mail-order pioneer Pryce Pryce-Jones in 1876, was also a forerunner of the modern sleeping bag. Pryce-Jones, a Newtown, Montgomeryshire Welsh entrepreneur developed the bag and exported it around the world in the late 19th century. Documents show he sold 60,000 of these rugs to the Russian army – and the British Army also bought them. There are records of civilian uses among missionaries in Africa and pioneers in the Australian outback.

==Design types==

A basic sleeping bag is simply a square blanket or quilt, fitted with a zipper on two or three sides, which enables users to get into the bag and then close it up. A sleeping bag of this type is packed by being folded in half or thirds, rolled up, and bound with straps or cords with cord locks. The basic design works well for most camping needs but is inadequate under more demanding circumstances.
The second major type of sleeping bag, sometimes called a mummy bag because of its shape, is different in several important ways. It tapers from the head end to the foot end, reducing its volume and surface area, and improving its overall heat retention properties. Some bags are designed especially to accommodate women&#x27;s body shapes. Most mummy bags do not unzip to the feet, because the zipper is a weak point in any sleeping bag&#x27;s insulating qualities. Together with the tapered shape, this design feature helps protect the feet, which are more vulnerable to heat loss than other parts of the body. Another design feature is a drawstring, equipped with a cord lock, at the head end to help prevent the escape of warm air. A mummy bag often cannot be rolled neatly like a rectangular bag. Instead, it is simply stuffed into a stuff sack or compression sack.

The bottom of a sleeping bag typically does not provide significant insulation, because body weight crushes the loft of the insulation material. It is therefore necessary to use a pad or other less crushable insulation underneath the sleeper, especially in cold weather. Due to this, some sleeping bags do not include insulation on the bottom. Some include a sleeve for holding a sleeping pad. Additionally, some campers, especially ultralight backpackers or hammock campers, have started to use a top quilt, essentially a sleeping bag without a back. Some top quilts include a foot box, while others are just simple blankets.

==Fill==

Many insulating materials are available for sleeping bags. Inexpensive sleeping bags for warm weather use or use by children indoors typically have a layer of synthetic quilt insulation. Outdoor professionals and serious amateur adventurers usually prefer either synthetic fill (e.g. PrimaLoft), or natural fill (e.g. down), and they have debated the merits of these materials for years.

Synthetic fill does not readily absorb water, dries easily, and provides some warmth even when thoroughly soaked. These properties may save the user&#x27;s life if, for example, the sleeping bag is accidentally dropped into water on a cold day. Synthetic material is also firm and resilient, so it insulates well even underneath a person&#x27;s weight. However, synthetic fill cannot be compressed as much and is heavier, so the load volume and weight are greater with synthetic fill bags. Furthermore, synthetic insulation tends to break down faster than its natural counterpart.

Down fill weighs less than synthetic and retains heat better, but usually costs more. Down must be kept dry; a soaked down sleeping bag may provide even less insulation than no sleeping bag at all, leading to hypothermia. Newer, more technically advanced sleeping bags often have water-resistant shells and can be used in damper conditions. It is also recommended to keep a sleeping bag in a larger sack (storage sack) as opposed to a small traveling sack (compression bag) during long periods of storage. However, many regular backpackers and hikers agree that hanging a sleeping bag, and taking care to move the position of the bag on the hanger at intervals to not create a &quot;dead spot&quot; (a spot where the fill has been crushed so that it is no longer useful), is the best method of storing a bag for long periods.

Other materials, notably cotton and wool, have also been used for sleeping bags. Wool repels water nicely and also resists compression, but it weighs much more than any alternative. Cotton suffers from high water retention and significant weight, but its low cost makes it an attractive option for uses like stationary camping or car camping where these drawbacks are of less consequence. Cotton insulation does not provide warmth if it becomes wet (due, for example, to the sleeping bag falling into water), so cotton-insulated sleeping bags are not used by professionals or serious hikers.

===Types of thermal insulation===
* PrimaLoft
* Thinsulate
* Down feathers
* Polyester

==Temperature ratings==

In Europe, the EN 13537 standard (introduced in 2005) normalizes the temperatures at which a sleeping bag is rated for use. In March 2010, REI began requiring American manufacturers to follow the EN 13537 standard, and in October 2016, ISO 23537-1:2016 standard replaced the EN 13537 standard.

The test, relying on a heated mannequin, provides four temperatures:
* the upper limit is the highest temperature at which a &#x27;standard&#x27; adult man can have a comfortable night&#x27;s sleep without excess sweating.
* the comfort rating is based on a &#x27;standard&#x27; adult woman having a comfortable night&#x27;s sleep.
* the lower limit is based on the lowest temperature at which a &#x27;standard&#x27; adult man with a rolled-curled up body posture is globally in thermal equilibrium and just not feeling cold.
* the extreme rating is a survival-only rating for a &#x27;standard&#x27; adult man. This is an extreme survival rating only and it is not advisable to rely on this rating for general use.

The &quot;transition zone&quot;, in between the comfort and lower temperature, is usually considered as the best purchase guideline.

A sleeping bag&#x27;s rating typically indicates the lowest temperature at which it will keep the average sleeper warm. For example, with a 0 °C bag, a person should be able to sleep in 0 °C temperature, but not necessarily comfortably. A sleeping bag&#x27;s test rating is based on a person who is wearing long underwear, socks and hat, and is sleeping on an insulated pad with an R-value of approximately 5.5.

There is no standard measurement rating in the U.S., so a bag from one company may not provide the same warmth as a from another company. Other important variables include what the user plans to wear while sleeping, what type of sleeping pad is used, and how well the user holds heat in the bag.

It has been shown that moisture (either externally, or from sweating) severely decreases the insulating effect of sleeping bags.

==Indoor sleeping bags==

Indoor sleeping bags, sometimes called slumber bags, are widely available, often for use, particularly by children. These are usually not designed to be weatherproof and are often made of natural fabrics instead of synthetic fabrics commonly used for outdoor sleeping bags. Children&#x27;s sleeping bags in particular often feature elaborate, brightly colored printed designs, such as images of popular media characters. Slumber bags make floor sleeping more comfortable, and are often used for sleepovers, family visits, and other situations where there are not enough beds for everyone or someone does not feel comfortable sharing a bed.
The Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi, Sweden provides polar-tested sleeping bags for use while sleeping on their beds, which are bedded with reindeer furs and have frames carved from ice.

== Infant use ==

An infant sleeping bag is a bag-like garment or covering worn by infants for sleeping in. Infant sleeping bags differ from regular sleeping bags in design and purpose, being designed primarily for indoor rather than outdoor use, and usually featuring either arm holes or sleeves.

In the market, there are available for winter and summer baby sleeping bags. Also, some brands make all-season baby sleeping bags.

The definition used in the British Standard For the safety of children sleep bags are &quot;sleep bags for the use of children with a minimum weight of 4  kg designed to provide sufficient warmth to remove the need for additional bedding when sleeping in a cot or similar product in which a child is contained.&quot; It goes on to exclude &quot;garments with sleeves and feet, i.e. sleep suits or baby grows, or to products designed primarily for outdoor use or to keep children warm when in a pushchair.&quot;

The male-only planet Taraak and the female-only planet Mejeer have been at war with each other for decades. During a military presentation of the Taraak space forces, their new combat ship, the Ikazuchi, is attacked and annexed by female pirates from Mejeer. Not wanting to lose, the commander of the Taraakian forces prefers to remotely destroy his ship with the intruders on board. However, a surprising event occurs. The Taraakian vessel and that of the pirates merge under the impulse of the Praksis crystal, a source of mysterious energy, to create a new vessel, which is later baptized NirVana. The Praksis energy ends up sending the newly formed vessel to the depths of space.

This merge also affects Mejeerian combat shuttles, known as Dreads, and a Taraakian mobile &quot;armor&quot;, the Vanguard, transforming their appearance and giving the Dreads the ability to combine with the Vanguard, forming the Vandread units. Three men, a third-class worker and two officers who remained on board and were taken prisoner by the pirates, will have to collaborate and learn to coexist with the women pirates of Mejeer, because their survival depends on it.

<doc id="239109" wikidata="Q5708511" url="?curid=239109" title="President of Peru">
<text>The president of Peru (), officially the constitutional president of the Republic of Peru (), is the head of state and head of government of Peru. The president is the head of the executive branch and is the supreme head of the Armed Forces and National Police of Peru. The office of president corresponds to the highest magistracy in the country, making the president the highest-ranking public official in Peru.

Due to broadly interpreted impeachment wording in the 1993 Constitution of Peru, the Congress of Peru can impeach the president without cause, effectively making the executive branch subject to the legislature.

The president is elected to direct the general policy of the government, work with the Congress of the Republic and the Council of Ministers to enact reform, and be an administrator of the state, enforcing the constitution, which establishes the presidential requirements, rights, and obligations. The executive branch is located at the Palacio de Gobierno, located in the historic center of Lima. The building has been used and occupied by the heads of state of Peru, dating back to Francisco Pizarro and the viceroys of Peru.

The current president is Dina Boluarte, who succeeded Pedro Castillo on 7 December 2022.

== Presidential terms and transitions ==

=== Constitutional limits ===
Ordinarily, the president is elected to a five-year term, and is barred from immediate reelection. A former president can run again after being out of office for a full term. The change of government takes place on 28 July, which is the date of independence from Spain and thus a national holiday.

The Congress of the Republic has the power to end a president&#x27;s term prematurely through impeachment. Under Article 113 of the Constitution of 1993, the president can be removed due to death, &quot;permanent moral or physical disability&quot; determined by Congress, resignation, fleeing national territory without permission from Congress, or dismissal for committing infractions outlined in Article 117 of the Constitution.

Four presidents of Peru have attempted to resign: Guillermo Billinghurst (forced resignation), Andrés Avelino Cáceres, Alberto Fujimori, and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. Three presidents have been impeached unsuccessfully, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Martín Vizcarra (first impeachment), and Pedro Castillo (first and second impeachments) while the impeachments of Billinghurst, Fujimori, Vizcarra (second impeachment), and Castillo (third impeachment) have been successful.

The president is elected to a term of five years without immediate re-election. A presidential inauguration is held every five years on 28 July in Congress. The last directly elected president was Pedro Castillo, who was elected for a term from 2021 to 2026. His Vice President, Dina Boluarte, a former civil servant, succeeded him as president following his impeachment after a failed coup attempt.

There have also been a number of unrecognized presidents. In 1992 and 2019, after the dissolution of the Congress, the legislative body unsuccessfully removed the president from office and swore in vice presidents as the de facto president.

There are 14 presidents that became presidents through a coup d&#x27;état. The last successful coup d&#x27;état was carried out by Alberto Fujimori in 1992, who was later imprisoned for human rights violations and corruption.

== Inauguration ==

=== Setting and attendees ===
Presidential inaugurations take place in the Congress of the Republic of Peru in the capital city of Lima. Presidential inaugurations always take place on 28 July of its respective year, although in the case of constitutional succession, an inauguration is on the day that the presidential successor arrives in Lima, Peru. The presidential inauguration precedes the National Parade of the Military of Peru.

Foreign dignitaries have often assisted the democratic transition of power in Peru.

=== Presidential oath ===
The contemporary placed presidential oath in Spanish is as follows:Yo, Martín Alberto Vizcarra Cornejo, juro por Dios, por la patria, y por todos los peruanos que ejerceré fielmente el cargo de Presidente de la República que me ha confiado el nación para el periodo 2018 a 2021, que defenderé la soberanía nacional y la integridad física y moral de la República, que cumpliré y hare cumplir la constitución política y las leyes del Perú, y que reconocerá, respetando la libertad de corto, la importancia de la Iglesia Católica en la formación cultural y moral de los peruanos.

Martín Alberto Vizcarra Cornejo, &quot;Presidential Oath of Office&quot; July 28, 2018 In EnglishThe English translation is as follows:I, [&quot;complete name of presidential elect&quot;], swear to God, to the Homeland, and to all Peruvians that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the Republic of Peru that has been entrusted to me by the Nation for the period [&quot;start of mandate&quot;] to [&quot;end of mandate&quot;], that I will defend the sovereignty of the nation as well as the physical and moral integrity of the Nation, that I will comply and enforce the political constitution and laws of Peru, and that I will recognize, respecting freedoms, the importance of the Roman Catholic Church in the cultural and moral formation of Peruvians. The president of Congress conventionally holds the presidential sash before the president-elect takes the oath of office. Once the president-elect has taken the oath of office, the president is recognized by all branches of the government of Peru as the democratic president of the Republic of Peru, symbolized by the president of the Congress passing the presidential sash. The nominee is recognized as the president of Peru with and only with the presidential sash.

As of 2019, there have been two illegitimate presidential inaugurations performed by the Congress of Peru, but not recognized by either the executive branch or the armed forces: one in 1995 and the inauguration of Mercedes Aráoz in 2019 amidst a confrontation between the executive and legislative powers of Peru.

There is also an emphasis on Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church in the oath of office. All presidents of Peru have been Catholic and have taken the oath of office alongside the Christian Bible, and in front of a Catholic Crucifix.

== Origin ==

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
The first state recognizable as such under current concepts in the central Andes was the Wari civilization, whose system of government has not yet been fully unraveled. Later, between the thirteenth century and the sixteenth century, the Inca civilization developed, whose State, based on the political management of reciprocity and alien to all European conceptions of then and now, had the Sapa Inca at its head.

The modern Peruvian state is the heir of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1532, the Spanish conquerors arrived in the territory, imposed their dominion and managed to establish a Spanish dependency. This dependence began as governorships corresponding to the conquerors, with the title of Governor. The Governorate of the New Toledo (Diego de Almagro) – which otherwise never consolidated – had as its capital the city of Cusco, the current historical capital of Peru. The Governorate of the New Castile (Francisco Pizarro) had as its capital the City of Kings, as Lima was also called initially and it was on this that the viceroyalty was instituted after the civil wars.

In 1542, the Viceroyalty of Peru was established, whose government was held by the representative of the king of Spain (head of state) with the title of Viceroy of Peru (head of government). The true organizer of the viceregal state was Francisco de Toledo.

This period had only two stages corresponding to the two Spanish dynasties, the houses of Habsburg and Bourbon, and lasted 282 years from its establishment in 1542 to the Capitulation of Ayacucho in 1824, despite the independence of Peru in 1821.

José Fernando de Abascal was in charge of centralizing Spanish political and military power in Peru. His successors, the last viceroys of Peru were parallel to Jose de San Martin and his first successors. Joaquín de la Pezuela and José de la Serna faced the liberating armies and the last of them signed the capitulation. Finally, Pío Tristán was the interim viceroy in charge of transferring power to the patriots.

=== Republic era ===
In July 1821, during the Peruvian War of Independence, the autonomous states lying in the viceroyalty of Peru declared themselves as independent and sovereign from influence and mediation from the Spanish Empire. Recognizing the impending threat of Spanish backlash to regain their lost colonies, the autonomous viceroyalty began to draft a constitution on which they would decide to base the sovereign nation. Working closely with the Constituent Congress of Peru in 1822, a formal constitution was created, named the Constitution of 1823. Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro, a Peruvian politician, presided and led the Constituent Congress of Peru, leading to him being subjectively regarded as the first informal President of Peru.

The first articles of the 1823 Constitution consisted of 24 items, known as the &quot;Bases&quot;. These bases formally defined the borders of the Andean nation and formally created the First Republic of Peru, which still holds until the present day. The governing board, led by Luna Pizarro, declared Peruvian autonomy from Spain and a Catholic state. Additionally, the Constitution defined the three powers of the government, the executive, judicial and the legislative power. The governing board, a colloquial terminology that was used to classify the ten politicians that devised these 24 items, was the first representation of executive power and the executive branch in Peruvian history.

Later, issues arose around the bases which granted the protectorate of Peru, Simon Bolivar, overwhelming power over the legislative and executive organs of the Peruvian government. At the same time, Bolivar was already undergoing a campaign to establish a dictatorship around Andean Latin American nations. As a precursor, this incentivized the initial drafters of the constitution and the Governing Board to accelerate the process of defining reasonable executive powers, balance the three branches of power, and begin to draft an idea for the roles and powers of the official position of state leader of Peru.

The Act of Independence was signed in Lima on 15 August 1821, and soon after the government was left under the charge of José de San Martín with the title of Protector. Later, the legislative branch occupied the executive branch. In 1823 the Congress appointed José de la Riva Agüero as the first President of the Republic of the history of Peru. Since then, that has been the main denomination that has held the great majority of the rulers of Peru. The same first Political Constitution of 1823 (after the appointment of Riva Agüero) recognizes the position, and says ex officio: &quot;Article 72. Resides exclusively the exercise of executive power in a citizen with the name of President of the Republic.&quot;

Only two constitutions have been contrary, partially, to the presidential republican system, the Lifetime Political Constitution of 1826 emanating from Simón Bolívar and expressing:&quot;The exercise of the Executive Power resides in a Life President, a Vice President, and four Secretaries of State.&quot;By 1827, an outline of an executive along with the executive branch had been drawn out to prevent a Bolivarian dictatorship which would be seen by the populace as a general return to Spanish tyrannical rule. As a result, on 28 July 1827, Manuel Salazar assumed the formal office of the presidency and became the first president of Peru to be elected by the populace, marking the start of the Presidency of Peru.

The Constitution of 1993, a product of the Presidency of Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000), is the constitution that is currently in place.

== Presidential symbols ==

=== Presidential sash ===

The presidential sash is the most distinctive feature that the President wears and has been used since the beginning of the Republic. It was inherited from the last Viceroys. The placement and delivery of the presidential sash symbolize a democratic transition of power. The band is used by the President of Congress until the new president is sworn in.

It is a bicolor band that carries the national colors (red and white). This band is worn diagonally from the right shoulder to the left side of the waist. At the waist, like a brooch, the band was embroidered in golden thread the Coat of arms of Peru. There is a Lima family that has traditionally made them. They are made to measure for each President and have been used normally with formal suit: suit, tuxedo or military uniform. Since 2006, the Shield was moved up to chest height.

A symbolic act narrated by Ricardo Palma in his famous &quot;Peruvian Traditions&quot; was made during the confused first half of the 1840s, by President Justo Figuerola. This, in front of the protests made by the pope in front of his home, he asked his daughter to take the presidential band out of the dresser drawer and give it to the people from the balcony. The crowd left happy and alive to Figuerola and went to find someone to impose the garment, which, so many times coveted, this time did not find who wanted to stick it.

The Ministers of State wear a red-and-white sash; Supreme Members, Congressmen of the Republic, Magistrates of the Constitutional Court, Members of the National Council of the Magistracy, Supreme Prosecutors, the Ombudsman, etc., wear red-and-white collars with medals that recognize them as such.

=== Grand Necklace of Brilliance ===
The necklace is the symbol of the highest authority in the country. It is composed of gold and encrusted with diamonds, bearing at the center a medal that contains the coat of arms of Peru. Presidents Oscar R. Benavides Larrea, Manuel Prado y Ugarteche and Jose Luis Bustamante y Rivero notably used the large necklace and other insignias. Its use disappeared after the administration of Fernando Belaúnde Terry. Recently its use was &#x27;revived&#x27; by Alan García Pérez in the European Union Summit held precisely in Lima in May 2008.

=== Plaque ===
The President of the Republic carries a plaque in the left upper pocket of the bag in the manner of a lanyard with the insignia of the military command that recognizes them as the Supreme Chief of the Armed Forces. It is the heir of the distinctive and military honors worn by presidents belonging to the Armed Forces throughout the history of the country. It is golden and has the shape of a radiant sun.

=== Staff ===
The staff originates from the Spanish custom of symbolizing power with a cane. The custom was introduced in the eighteenth century in the Andes, after the rebellion of José Gabriel Túpac Amaru and Túpac Catari in 1780 to represent the dignity of mayor of Incas. Unlike Argentina, the use of a cane that symbolizes the power and office of President (symbolically, varayoc), has not been common in the history of the Peruvian presidency and has been replaced innumerable times by the saber or the sword of the military presidents. There is only a handful of remarkable cases. Mariano Ignacio Prado, José Balta and Augusto B. Leguía used it in pictures and presidential photographs. Recently, Alejandro Toledo, made use of the cane in his symbolic assumption to the charge in Cusco and also on a few other occasions. Its most recent use corresponds to 29 July 2008, the date of the traditional military parade, when Alan García carried a small presidential staff, the same one used by Ollanta Humala in the military parade on 29 July 2011.

== Eligibility ==

The Constitution of 1823, the first constitution of this country, indicates that to be the President of Peru one must:

* Be a person born in Peru.
* Gather the same qualities as to be a leader.
* Be a citizen in practice.
* Be over 35 years old.
* Be from Peru.
* Have a property or income of eight hundred soles at least, or exercise any industry that yields them annually, or be a public professor of some science.

The Constitution of 1826, on the other hand, incorporating some subjective concepts, requires the following:

* Be over thirty years of age.
* Have done important services to the Republic.
* Have well-known talents in the administration of the State.
* Never have been convicted by the Courts, even for minor offenses.

The Constitution of 1856 states the requirements to be president: be Peruvian by birth, citizen in office and thirty-five years of age and ten of domicile in the Republic, which will remain virtually unchanged until today. As of 1979, the requirement of having resided in the country for the last ten years is eliminated.

=== Constitution of 1993 (contemporary) ===

* A President must be Peruvian by birth (those who are Peruvians by naturalization cannot access the position). They must be more than thirty-five years of age at the time they are applying for a job and fully exercising their civil rights, that is, they must not bear any penal sanction or civil declaration of disability, which includes the right to vote.

**The Ministers and Deputy Ministers of State, the Comptroller General.
**The members of the Constitutional Court, the National Council of the Judiciary, the Judicial Power, the Public Ministry, the National Elections Jury, and the Ombuds.
**The President of the Central Reserve Bank, the Superintendent of Banking, Insurance and Private Administrators of Pension Funds and the National Superintendent of Tax Administration.

**The other cases that the Constitution provides.

According to the Organic Law of Elections, they cannot run for the Presidency or Vice Presidencies of the Republic:

* The Ministers and Deputy Ministers of State, the Comptroller General of the Republic and the regional authorities, if they have not resigned at least six months before the election.
* The members of the Constitutional Court, of the National Council of the Judiciary, of the Judicial Power, of the Public Ministry, of the organisms that comprise the Electoral System and the Ombudsperson, if they have not left office 6 (six) months before the election

== History ==

During its more than 190 years of independence, Peru has been ruled by the military leaders who fought for independence, the leaders of the War of the Pacific, representatives of the aristocracy, and democratically elected leaders. Also, the history of the presidency has involved civil wars, coups and violence. More than once, several individuals claimed the right to be president at the same time.

Different titles have been used, such as &quot;Protector of Peru&quot; (used by José de San Martín), and &quot;Supreme Protector&quot; (by Andrés de Santa Cruz).

=== List of presidents of Peru ===
==Post-presidency==
All former elected presidents of Peru since 1985 have been prosecuted since leaving office:
*Prior to his resignation in 2000, Alberto Fujimori escaped to Japan seeking political refuge. He unsuccessfully attempted to run for a parliamentary position in the Parliament of Japan, and ultimately returned to Latin America in 2006 to run for the 2006 presidential elections. The refugee president&#x27;s flight diverted to Chile, where he stayed for six days. Peruvian officials and the President of Peru during the time expressed discontent at Chilean officials for allowing the indicted former president into the continent without repercussion. Ultimately, Fujimori flew back to Peru for unstated reasons and was arrested. Fujimori was convicted of corruption, bribery, human rights violations, crimes against humanities, murder, and other charges, for 25 years of prison until 2031. Fujimori served his sentence until 2017, where then Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski issued a presidential pardon, clearing Fujimori of his conviction. Following the resignation of Kuczynski, the pardon was declared illegitimate in 2019 and Fujimori was arrested and returned to confinement. The pardon was reinstated in 2023 and Fujimori was ultimately again released in December of that year, nine months before his death.
*Following the end of his term in 2006, Alejandro Toledo abruptly withdrew from Peruvian politics. Toledo and his spouse, Eliane Karp, both moved to California, in the United States, where they have resided since, to avoid prosecution. Toledo and his wife were charged with multiple offenses of corruption and probing, and have been summoned to Peru for a trial. Toledo ignored this warning and proceeded to remain in the United States. Toledo claimed to have been a professor at Stanford University, but the university verified that Toledo was solely invited as a one-time guest speaker to the institution. Many efforts have been made by former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and President Martin Vizcarra to extradite Toledo, but no responses have been heard from the United States government. In March 2019, Toledo was temporarily arrested for public drunkenness in California, and was released later that night. Via a call in, Toledo denied that he was arrested. There is currently a $25,000 reward for the ex-president. In August 2019, Toledo was arrested in Northern California as part of an extradition request from the Ministry of Justice of Peru. He was held in custody until he was extradited in June 2023.
*Ollanta Humala and his wife, Nadine Heredia, were abruptly arrested following the end of his term. Both of them were detained for 6 months for investigation on the means of corruption, but were later released. There were no conclusions or evidence provided by the investigation. Humala continues to reside in Lima awaiting his trial.
*Following his resignation in March 2018, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski quietly left the Government Palace and returned to his home in the district of San Isidro. Kuczynski remained out of the public eye for the following ten months, but was then summoned to the Department of Justice. All of Kuczynski&#x27;s bank accounts were frozen and he was prohibited from leaving the country. Kuczynski made few public appearances, but on the first anniversary of his resignation, Kuczynski made his first major public appearance on El Comercio, a major Peruvian newspaper. The former president mentioned his present financial ruins and the amounts of loans he was forced to make. Additionally, Kuczynski mentioned that he felt betrayed by Martin Vizcarra, the incumbent President of Peru who succeeded Kuczynski following his resignation. On 10 April 2019, Kuczynski was arrested for primary corruption charges on the basis of an ongoing investigation into his connections with Odebrecht, money laundering, and bribery. At the end of his detention, Kuczynski was sentenced to three years of house imprisonment until 2022.
*Martín Vizcarra faced several allegations of corruption following his impeachment and was banned from public office for ten years in 2021 due to his involvement in Vacunagate.
*Manuel Merino was president for five days from 10 to 15 November 2020, following the impeachment and removal of Martín Vizcarra by the Peruvian Congress, before stepping down amid widespread protests resulting in casualties. He was inaugurated as president following the line of succession established in the constitution. After his presidency, he was investigated for human rights violations that occurred during mass protests.
*Alan García faced an investigation due to his involvement in the Odebrecht scandal. While police attempted to arrest him in April 2019, Garcia committed suicide.
*Pedro Castillo was removed from office following a failed self-coup attempt and was arrested while attempting to flee towards the Mexican embassy in Lima. Currently, Castillo is imprisoned for charges of rebellion, while also facing several corruption investigations.
*Current President Dina Boluarte is facing an investigation for genocide and crimes against humanity due to her administration&#x27;s harsh response to social unrest.
*In addition, Francisco Morales Bermudez, who was president from 1975 to 1980, was sentenced to life in prison by an Italian court in January 2017.

== Demographics of the presidents ==
In contemporary history, two presidents are known not to have been of direct Peruvian descent, being Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000) and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016–2018). Fujimori is of Japanese descent and Kuczynski is of German, Jewish, French and Polish descent. A majority of presidents have been born in Lima.

Three presidents have been assassinated in Peru&#x27;s history—Felipe Santiago Salaverry, Tomás Gutiérrez, and Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro. One president, Alan García (1985–1990, 2006–2011), committed suicide.

The tallest recorded president is Alan García, who stood at 1.93 m. The shortest is Alejandro Toledo (2001–2006), who stands at 1.65 m. The oldest person to assume the presidency was Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016–2018) who assumed the presidency at 78 years and 217 days, with the second being Fernando Belaunde Terry (1963–1968, 1980–1985) who assumed his second presidency at 78 years and 39 days.

The president who has reached the longest life span is Francisco Morales Bermúdez (1975–1980), who lived to be 100. Three Peruvian presidents lived into their nineties:

*Francisco Morales Bermúdez (4 October 1921 – 14 July 2022) (age ), the longest-lived Peruvian President and Prime Minister
*José Luis Bustamante y Rivero (15 January 1894 – 11 January 1989) (aged )

<text>Mathematical tables are lists of numbers showing the results of a calculation with varying arguments. Trigonometric tables were used in ancient Greece and India for applications to astronomy and celestial navigation, and continued to be widely used until electronic calculators became cheap and plentiful in the 1970s, in order to simplify and drastically speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks, and specialized tables were published for numerous applications.

==History and use==
The first tables of trigonometric functions known to be made were by Hipparchus (c.190 – c.120 BCE) and Menelaus (c.70–140 CE), but both have been lost. Along with the surviving table of Ptolemy (c. 90 – c.168 CE), they were all tables of chords and not of half-chords, that is, the sine function. The table produced by the Indian mathematician Āryabhaṭa (476–550 CE) is considered the first sine table ever constructed. 
Āryabhaṭa&#x27;s table remained the standard sine table of ancient India. There were continuous attempts to improve the accuracy of this table, culminating in the discovery of the power series expansions of the sine and cosine functions by Madhava of Sangamagrama (c.1350 – c.1425), and the tabulation of a sine table by Madhava with values accurate to seven or eight decimal places.

Tables of common logarithms were used until the invention of computers and electronic calculators to do rapid multiplications, divisions, and exponentiations, including the extraction of &quot;n&quot;th roots.

Mechanical special-purpose computers known as difference engines were proposed in the 19th century to tabulate polynomial approximations of logarithmic functions – that is, to compute large logarithmic tables. This was motivated mainly by errors in logarithmic tables made by the human computers of the time. Early digital computers were developed during World War II in part to produce specialized mathematical tables for aiming artillery. From 1972 onwards, with the launch and growing use of scientific calculators, most mathematical tables went out of use.

One of the last major efforts to construct such tables was the Mathematical Tables Project that was started in the United States in 1938 as a project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), employing 450 out-of-work clerks to tabulate higher mathematical functions. It lasted through World War II.

Tables of special functions are still used. For example, the use of tables of values of the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution – so-called standard normal tables – remains commonplace today, especially in schools, although the use of scientific and graphical calculators as well as spreadsheet and dedicated statistical software on personal computers is making such tables redundant.

Creating tables stored in random-access memory is a common code optimization technique in computer programming, where the use of such tables speeds up calculations in those cases where a table lookup is faster than the corresponding calculations (particularly if the computer in question doesn&#x27;t have a hardware implementation of the calculations). In essence, one trades computing speed for the computer memory space required to store the tables.

==Trigonometric tables==
Trigonometric calculations played an important role in the early study of astronomy. Early tables were constructed by repeatedly applying trigonometric identities (like the half-angle and angle-sum identities) to compute new values from old ones. 

===A simple example===
To compute the sine function of 75 degrees, 9 minutes, 50 seconds using a table of trigonometric functions such as the Bernegger table from 1619 illustrated above, one might simply round up to 75 degrees, 10 minutes and then find the 10 minute entry on the 75 degree page, shown above-right, which is 0.9666746.

However, this answer is only accurate to four decimal places. If one wanted greater accuracy, one could interpolate linearly as follows:

From the Bernegger table:
:sin (75° 10′) = 0.9666746
:sin (75° 9′) = 0.9666001

The difference between these values is 0.0000745.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute of arc, we multiply the difference by 50/60 to get a correction of (50/60)*0.0000745 ≈ 0.0000621; and then add that correction to sin (75° 9′) to get :

:sin (75° 9′ 50″) ≈ sin (75° 9′) + 0.0000621 = 0.9666001 + 0.0000621 = 0.9666622

A modern calculator gives sin(75° 9′ 50″) = 0.96666219991, so our interpolated answer is accurate to the 7-digit precision of the Bernegger table.

For tables with greater precision (more digits per value), higher order interpolation may be needed to get full accuracy. In the era before electronic computers, interpolating table data in this manner was the only practical way to get high accuracy values of mathematical functions needed for applications such as navigation, astronomy and surveying.

To understand the importance of accuracy in applications like navigation note that at sea level one minute of arc along the Earth&#x27;s equator or a meridian (indeed, any great circle) equals one nautical mile (approximately ).

==Tables of logarithms==

Tables containing common logarithms (base-10) were extensively used in computations prior to the advent of electronic calculators and computers because logarithms convert problems of multiplication and division into much easier addition and subtraction problems. Base-10 logarithms have an additional property that is unique and useful: The common logarithm of numbers greater than one that differ only by a factor of a power of ten all have the same fractional part, known as the &quot;mantissa&quot;. Tables of common logarithms typically included only the mantissas; the integer part of the logarithm, known as the &quot;characteristic&quot;, could easily be determined by counting digits in the original number. A similar principle allows for the quick calculation of logarithms of positive numbers less than 1. Thus a single table of common logarithms can be used for the entire range of positive decimal numbers. See common logarithm for details on the use of characteristics and mantissas.

===History===

In 1544, Michael Stifel published &quot;Arithmetica integra&quot;, which contains a table of integers and powers of 2 that has been considered an early version of a logarithmic table.

The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by John Napier in 1614, in a book entitled &quot;Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio&quot; (&quot;Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms&quot;). The book contained fifty-seven pages of explanatory matter and ninety pages of tables related to natural logarithms. The English mathematician Henry Briggs visited Napier in 1615, and proposed a re-scaling of Napier&#x27;s logarithms to form what is now known as the common or base-10 logarithms. Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table. In 1617, they published &quot;Logarithmorum Chilias Prima&quot; (&quot;The First Thousand Logarithms&quot;), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a table for the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place. Prior to Napier&#x27;s invention, there had been other techniques of similar scopes, such as the use of tables of progressions, extensively developed by Jost Bürgi around 1600.

The computational advance available via common logarithms, the converse of powered numbers or exponential notation, was such that it made calculations by hand much quicker.

<text>A calculation is a deliberate mathematical process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more outputs or &quot;results&quot;. The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite arithmetical calculation of using an algorithm, to the vague heuristics of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people.

For example, multiplying 7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. Extracting the square root or the cube root of a number using mathematical models is a more complex algorithmic calculation.
Statistical estimations of the likely election results from opinion polls also involve algorithmic calculations, but produces ranges of possibilities rather than exact answers.

To &quot;calculate&quot; means to determine mathematically in the case of a number or amount, or in the case of an abstract problem to deduce the answer using logic, reason or common sense. The English word derives from the Latin , which originally meant a pebble (from Latin ), for instance the small stones used as a counters on an abacus (, ). The abacus was an instrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the slide-rule and the electronic calculator, and consisted of perforated pebbles sliding on iron bars.

<text>Abrus precatorius, commonly known as jequirity bean or rosary pea, is a herbaceous flowering plant in the bean family Fabaceae. It is a slender, perennial climber with long, pinnate-leafleted leaves that twines around trees, shrubs, and hedges.

The plant is best known for its seeds, which are used as beads and in percussion instruments, and which are toxic because of the presence of abrin. Ingestion of a single seed, well chewed, can be fatal to both adults and children. The plant is native to Asia and Australia. It has a tendency to become weedy and invasive where it has been introduced.

==Names==
&quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; is commonly known as jequirity, Crab&#x27;s eye, or rosary pea, paternoster pea, love pea, precatory pea or bean, prayer bead, John Crow Bead, coral bead, red-bead vine, country licorice, Indian licorice, wild licorice, Jamaica wild licorice, olinda (In Sri Lanka/Sinhala), kundumani (in Tamil), coondrimany, gidee gidee, Jumbie bead, ratti (in Hindi) / rettee / retty, or weather plant.

In Africa, &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; is known as Ojuologbo (Yoruba), Oto-berebere (Igbo), Idonzakara (Hausa) and Nneminua (Ib) in southwestern Nigeria and obirekuaiura in Ghana.

==Ecology and invasiveness==
&quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; is a severely invasive plant in warm temperate to tropical regions, so much so that it has become effectively pantropical in distribution. It had been widely introduced by humans, and the brightly coloured and hard-shelled seeds had been spread by birds. By the end of the twentieth century, it had been proclaimed as an invasive weed in many regions including some in Belize, Caribbean Islands, Hawaii, Polynesia and parts of the mainland United States. In Florida in particular, the plant has invaded undisturbed pinelands and hammocks, including the vulnerable pine rocklands.

Once &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; plants have grown to maturity under favourable conditions, their deep roots are extremely difficult to remove, and the plants&#x27; aggressive growth, hard-shelled seeds, and ability to sucker, renders an infestation extremely difficult to eradicate and makes it very difficult to prevent re-infestation. Herbicides such as glyphosate are effective, but need skilled application if they are not to do more harm than good.

==Toxin==
The toxin abrin is a dimer consisting of two protein subunits, termed A and B. The B chain facilitates abrin&#x27;s entry into a cell by bonding to certain transport proteins on cell membranes, which then transport the toxin into the cell. Once inside the cell, the A chain prevents protein synthesis by inactivating the 28S RNA of the ribosome. One molecule of abrin will inactivate up to 1,500 ribosomes per second.

Symptoms are identical to those of ricin, except abrin is more toxic by almost two orders of magnitude; the fatal dose of abrin is approximately 1/75 that of the fatal dose of ricin (though the abrin in ingested seeds may be absorbed much more slowly than the ricin in &quot;Ricinus communis&quot; even if the seeds are chewed and the coat penetrated, allowing time for successful rescue efforts in at least some cases.) Abrin has an of only 0.56 μg/kg in mice, and Kingsbury lists a toxic dose in humans at 0.00015% body weight, or approximately 0.1 mg for a 150 lb human. Ingesting intact seeds may result in no clinical findings, as they can pass undigested through the gastrointestinal tract because of their hard shell.

This plant is also poisonous to horses.

Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, convulsions, liver failure, and death, usually after several days.

==Uses==
=== Jewelry ===
The seeds of &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; are much valued in native jewelry for their bright coloration. Most beans are black and red, reminiscent of a ladybug, though other colors exist. Jewelry-making with jequirity seeds is rumored to be somewhat hazardous. There are persistent reports that the workers who pierce the seeds in order to thread them can suffer poisoning or even death from a pinprick, but there seems to be little evidence. An online search found 265 scientific papers referring to &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot;, but not one of them dealt with occupational poisoning.

In Trinidad in the West Indies the brightly colored seeds are strung into bracelets and worn around the wrist or ankle to ward off jumbies or evil spirits and &quot;mal-yeux&quot;—the evil eye. The Tamils use &quot;Abrus&quot; seeds of different colors. The red variety with black eye is the most common, but there are black, white and green varieties as well.

In December 2011 a recall was issued for bracelets made using jequirity beans sold by the Eden Project and other outlets in the UK.

=== Unit of measure ===
The seeds of &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; are very consistent in weight, even under different moisture conditions due to the water-impermeable seed-coat. Formerly Indians used these seeds to weigh gold using a measure called a &quot;Ratti&quot;, where 8 Ratti = 1 Masha; 12 Masha = 1 Tola (11.6 Grams).

=== As a weapon ===
According to the 1898 King&#x27;s American Dispensatory,
Abrus seeds are the agents by which the Chamàr or &quot;Native Skinner&quot; caste of India carry on the felonious poisoning of cattle for the purpose of securing their hides. This is done by means of small spikes, called &quot;sui&quot; (needles) or &quot;sutari&quot; (awls), which are prepared by soaking the awl in a thin paste of the water-soaked, pounded seeds, and then drying the weapon in the sun, after which it is oiled and sharpened upon stone, affixed in a handle, and then used to puncture the skin of the animal.

An 1881 work by the District Superintendent of Police for British-occupied Bengal details the preparation and use of the &quot;sutari&quot; for the killing of cattle and in at least six murder cases. A native, promised a reduced sentence for the poisoning of a fellow villager&#x27;s bullock in exchange for his testimony, demonstrated the technique. First the outer shells of red or white seeds were cracked between stones, then the two cotyledons from within thirty or forty seeds were soaked in water for ten minutes. These seeds were ground to a paste and rolled up into six sharp-ended one-inch cones, which were inserted into either end of three pieces of straw and &quot;exposed to the moderate influence of the sun&quot; to dry, whereupon they regained some of the original hardness of the seed. In this account, the sutaries were described as being these cones, entirely made up of the hardened seed paste. The dried cones were checked for sharpness, and if need be, whetted with a brick and re-set. Finally, to prevent softening, they were waterproofed by &quot;burying them for a night in some sort of animal grease.&quot; For testing, which Major Ramsay asked to be done exactly like a surreptitious killing, the prisoner set two sutaries into a 1.5-inch wooden handle meant to be held in the hand by pressing them into a rag stretched over sockets in the wood. A wandering &quot;Brahmanee bull&quot; was procured, and the prisoner brought the sutari down in one direction and away in the other, so as to break off the cones inside the animal&#x27;s flesh behind the horn, then pressed the skin over the broken ends leaving no obvious trace of the injury. This process was repeated with two more cones to the base of the animal&#x27;s tongue. The bull died after 34.5 hours, leaving no visible trace of the sutaries but a small amount of pus at the wound site, whose swelling had mostly subsided by the time of death.

The 1890 &quot;Pharmacographia Indica&quot; gives an account, based in part on the above work, describing the sutaris or suis (the terms being equivalent, depending on district, with the former based on the object&#x27;s resemblance to the point of a cobbler&#x27;s awl). It describes the sutaris as 3/4 inch long and weighing 1.5 to 2 grains, varying in color from dirty white to black, and describes the handle as 3 to 3.5 inches long and frequently made from two joints of bamboo wood, with sockets 1/4 to 3/8 inch deep and with the cavity exposed at one end for storage of additional sutaris. The weapons were sometimes made with the milky juice of &quot;Calotropis gigantea&quot; instead of water, which was said to speed the effect, and were sometimes supplemented with metallic mercury, dhatura, aconite, and/or arsenic. It is added that &quot;any attempt to withdraw the sutari by pulling at the pieces sticking out, invariably breaks it, a portion being left in the wound.&quot; One man murdered by a single blow with a pair of sutaris died after three days; another, from whom the material had been successfully excised, died three days later of tetanus. The price of one of these killings was said to total 16.5 rupees; the killers were punished by transportation for life.

=== In traditional medicine ===
&quot;Abrus precatorius&quot;, called &quot;Gulaganji&quot; in Kannada, &quot;kundu mani&quot; in Tamil, &quot;Guruvinda ginja&quot; in Telugu and &#x27;Kunni kuru&#x27; in Malayalam, has been used in Siddha medicine for centuries. The white variety is used to prepare oil that is claimed to be an aphrodisiac. A tea is made from the leaves and used for fevers, coughs and colds. Seeds are poisonous and therefore are only consumed after heat treatment. The Tamil Siddhars knew about the toxic effects in plants and suggested various methods which is called &quot;suththi seythal&quot; or purification. This is done by boiling the seeds in milk and then drying them. Like with castor oil, the protein toxin is denatured when subjected to high temperatures rendering it innocuous.

The 1889 book &#x27;The Useful Native Plants of Australia&#x27; records that &quot;The roots of this plant are used in India as a substitute for liquorice, though they are somewhat bitter. In Java the roots are considered demulcent. The leaves, when mixed with honey, are applied to swellings, and in Jamaica are used as a substitute for tea. Under the name of &quot;Jequirity&quot; the seeds have recently been employed in cases of ophthalmia, a use to which they have long been put in India and Brazil.&quot;

The plant is also used in Ayurveda and is said to promote hair growth. It is sometimes used as an ingredient in Indian hair products.

The leaves of &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; are used by the indigenous communities of the Western region of Ghana as an anti-diabetic medicine.

==Laboratory study of extracts==

A variety of pharmacological effects have been observed in rodents, but have not been demonstrated clinically in humans, including:
* An ethanolic extract of &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; was found to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential in rodents.
* A methanolic extract of &quot;A. precatorius&quot; seeds causes reversible alterations in the estrous cycle pattern and completely blocked ovulation in Sprague-Dawley rats.
* Studies on aqueous, methanolic and chloroform extracts of &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; showed greater inhibitory activity against a number of disease-causing bacteria such as &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot;, and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.
* A dried ethanolic leaf extract of &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; showed pancreato-protective effects and glucose lowering effects in Sprague-Dawley rats. This was found in another study to be through modulation of insulin and GLP-1 inversely with glucagon, noncompetitive inhibition of &quot;α&quot;-amylase and &quot;α&quot;-glucosidase, free radical scavenging, and recovery of damaged/necro-apoptosized pancreatic &quot;β&quot;-cells.

==Cultural significance==
In Rajasthan, India, Chirmi song is associated with this plant. There is also evidence that this plant has significant economic value to the traditional Zulu people, due to the fact that it is a form of income for Zulu people that make and sell crafts that were made from the seeds of this plant.

During the Tang dynasty, Wang Wei wrote a poem titled &quot;One-hearted&quot; (&quot;Xiāng Sī&quot; / 相思), which most likely refers to &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot; as a &quot;red bean&quot; (&quot;hóng dòu&quot; / 红豆).

In Mathura, India, the god Vishnu and Krishna is associated with the seeds of the plant. Lord Krishna is sometimes depicted wearing the seeds on a mala (rosary).

<text>A privet is a flowering plant in the genus Ligustrum. The genus contains about 50 species of erect, deciduous or evergreen shrubs, sometimes forming small or medium-sized trees, native to Europe, north Africa, Asia, many introduced and naturalised in Australasia, where only one species, &quot;Ligustrum australianum&quot;, extends as a native into Queensland. Some species have become widely naturalized or invasive where introduced. &quot;Privet&quot; was originally the name for the European semi-evergreen shrub &quot;Ligustrum vulgare&quot;, and later also for the more reliably evergreen &quot;Ligustrum ovalifolium&quot; and its hybrid &quot;Ligustrum × ibolium&quot; used extensively for privacy hedging, though now the name is applied to all members of the genus. The generic name was applied by Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) to &quot;L. vulgare&quot;. It is often suggested that the name &quot;privet&quot; is related to &quot;private&quot;, but the OED states that there is no evidence to support this.

==Description==
Privet is a group of shrubs and small trees of southern and eastern Asia, from the Himalayas extending into Australia. They may be evergreen or deciduous, and are tolerant of different soil types. They often have conspicuous heads of white flowers followed by black berries.

==Uses and cultivation==
In addition to being cultivated to create ornamental hedges and foliage, privet is also widely used in horticulture and flower arrangements. The oval leaf privet &quot;Ligustrum ovalifolium&quot; is used for hedges, while its flexible twigs are sometimes used as cords for lashing. The tree species, especially Chinese privet is frequently used as a street tree in Europe, while other species including &quot;Ligustrum japonicum&quot; and &quot;Ligustrum quihoui&quot; are among the others also sometimes used as ornamental plants in gardens.
Privet became very popular in Britain as a replacement for ornamental railings around properties, which had been lost to the 1941 Government compulsorily requisitioning of all post-1850 iron gates and railings for the war effort the idea being that the donated metal would be melted down for use in the manufacture of armaments in WWII, although this ultimately did not happen. The remaining stubs of sawn-off railings can still be seen on many garden walls in the UK, often partly obscured by privet bushes.

Chinese privet is used in traditional herbal medicine. The decoction of privet leaves or bark helps to treat diarrhea, stomach ulcers, chronic bowel problems, chapped lips, sore mouths and throats, and a wash for skin problems. Privet leaves and bark have bitter properties that make a useful tea for improving appetite and digestion in chemotherapy patients. Kuding is a Chinese tea made from either a &quot;Ligustrum&quot; or &quot;Ilex&quot; species.

Some species produce a fruit, which is mildly toxic to humans. Symptoms from eating privet fruit include nausea, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, low blood pressure, and low body temperature. At least some privet species are known to be toxic to horses.

==Ecology==
A plant may produce thousands of fruits, most of which are eaten by birds.
Privet is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the common emerald, common marbled carpet, copper underwing, engrailed, mottled beauty, scalloped hazel, small angle shades, v-pug, privet hawk moth and willow beauty.

===Invasiveness===
Privet is a successful invasive species because of its ability to outcompete and therefore displace native vegetation, due to its adaptability. Various species are now a problem in North America, Australia and New Zealand.

<text>William Jones, FRS (16751 July 1749) was a Welsh mathematician best known for his use of the symbol (the Greek letter &quot;Pi&quot;) to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. He was a close friend of Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Edmund Halley. In November 1711, Jones became a fellow of the Royal Society, and later served as the Royal Society&#x27;s vice-president.

==Early life==
William Jones was born as the son of Siôn Siôr (John George Jones) and Elizabeth Rowland in the parish of Llanfihangel Tre&#x27;r Beirdd, about west of Benllech on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales. He attended a charity school at Llanfechell, also on the Isle of Anglesey, where his mathematical talents were spotted by the local landowner Lord Bulkeley, who arranged for him to work in a merchant&#x27;s counting-house in London. His main patrons were the Bulkeley family of north Wales, and later the Earl of Macclesfield.

==Early mathematical career==
Jones initially served at sea, teaching mathematics on board Navy ships between 1695 and 1702, where he became very interested in navigation and published &quot;A New Compendium of the Whole Art of Navigation&quot; in 1702, dedicated to a benefactor John Harris. In this work he applied mathematics to navigation, studying methods of calculating position at sea. After his voyages were over he became a mathematics teacher in London, both in coffee houses and as a private tutor to George Parker, the son of the future Earl of Macclesfield, and also the future Baron Hardwicke. He also held a number of undemanding posts in government offices with the help of his former pupils.
==Later career==
Jones published &quot;Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos&quot; in 1706, a work which was intended for beginners and which included theorems on differential calculus and infinite series. This used for the ratio of circumference to diameter, following earlier abbreviations for the Greek word &quot;periphery&quot; (περιφέρεια) by William Oughtred and others. His 1711 work &quot;Analysis per quantitatum series, fluxiones ac differentias&quot; introduced the dot notation for differentiation in calculus. 

He was noticed and befriended by two of Britain&#x27;s foremost mathematicians – Edmund Halley and Sir Isaac Newton – and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1711. He later became the editor and publisher of many of Newton&#x27;s manuscripts and built up an extraordinary library that was one of the greatest collections of books on science and mathematics ever known, and only recently fully dispersed. Jones&#x27; Last Will and Testament left his library, along with his gold watch, to Earl of Macclesfield in acknowledgement of his support. 
==Personal life==
He married twice, firstly the widow of his counting-house employer, whose property he inherited on her death, and secondly, in 1731, Mary, the 22-year-old daughter of cabinet-maker George Nix, with whom he had two surviving children. His son, also named William Jones and born in 1746, was a renowned philologist who established links between Latin, Greek and Sanskrit, leading to the concept of the Indo-European language group.

<text>A pentaprism is a five-sided reflecting prism used to deviate a beam of light by a constant 90°, even if the entry beam is not at 90° to the prism.
The beam reflects inside the prism &quot;twice&quot;, allowing the transmission of an image through a right angle without inverting it (that is, without changing the image&#x27;s handedness) as an ordinary right-angle prism or mirror would.

The reflections inside the prism are not caused by total internal reflection, since the beams are incident at an angle less than the critical angle (the minimum angle for total internal reflection). Instead, the two faces are coated to provide mirror surfaces. The two opposite transmitting faces are often coated with an antireflection coating to reduce spurious reflections. The fifth face of the prism is not used optically but truncates what would otherwise be an awkward angle joining the two mirrored faces.

== In cameras ==

A variant of this prism is the roof pentaprism which is commonly used in the viewfinder of single-lens reflex cameras. The camera lens renders an image that is both vertically and laterally reversed, and the reflex mirror re-inverts it leaving an image laterally reversed. In this case, the image needs to be reflected left-to-right as the prism transmits the image formed on the camera&#x27;s focusing screen. This lateral inversion is done by replacing one of the reflective faces of a normal pentaprism with a &quot;roof&quot; section, with two additional surfaces angled towards each other and meeting at 90°, which laterally reverses the image back to normal. Reflex cameras with waist-level finders (viewed from above), including many medium format cameras, display a laterally reversed image directly from the focusing screen which is viewed from above.
=== Compared to the pentamirror ===
The same optical paths can be realized with three mirrors, in an arrangement called the pentamirror. While substantially lighter, the light enters and exits the mirrors&#x27; glass several times, each time losing brightness and instead scattering. The pentaprism is typically much heavier, but only has one entrance and one exit, providing a notably superior optical performance. Additionally, pentamirrors can conceivably go out of alignment while a pentaprism&#x27;s facets are perfectly aligned until it is destroyed. 


==In surveying==
In surveying a double pentaprism (two pentaprisms stacked on top of each other) and a plumb-bob are used to stake out right angles, e.g. on a construction site.

<doc id="239138" wikidata="Q18748" url="?curid=239138" title="Reliability (statistics)">
<text>In statistics and psychometrics, reliability is the overall consistency of a measure. A measure is said to have a high reliability if it produces similar results under consistent conditions:It is the characteristic of a set of test scores that relates to the amount of random error from the measurement process that might be embedded in the scores. Scores that are highly reliable are precise, reproducible, and consistent from one testing occasion to another. That is, if the testing process were repeated with a group of test takers, essentially the same results would be obtained. Various kinds of reliability coefficients, with values ranging between 0.00 (much error) and 1.00 (no error), are usually used to indicate the amount of error in the scores. For example, measurements of people&#x27;s height and weight are often extremely reliable.

==Types==
There are several general classes of reliability estimates:
*Inter-rater reliability assesses the degree of agreement between two or more raters in their appraisals. For example, a person gets a stomach ache and different doctors all give the same diagnosis.
*Test-retest reliability assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent from one test administration to the next. Measurements are gathered from a single rater who uses the same methods or instruments and the same testing conditions. This includes intra-rater reliability.
*Inter-method reliability assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent when there is a variation in the methods or instruments used. This allows inter-rater reliability to be ruled out. When dealing with forms, it may be termed parallel-forms reliability.
*Internal consistency reliability, assesses the consistency of results across items within a test.

== Difference from validity ==
Reliability does not imply validity. That is, a reliable measure that is measuring something consistently is not necessarily measuring what is supposed to be measured. For example, while there are many reliable tests of specific abilities, not all of them would be valid for predicting, say, job performance.

While reliability does not imply validity, reliability does place a limit on the overall validity of a test. A test that is not perfectly reliable cannot be perfectly valid, either as a means of measuring attributes of a person or as a means of predicting scores on a criterion. While a reliable test may provide useful valid information, a test that is not reliable cannot possibly be valid.

For example, if a set of weighing scales consistently measured the weight of an object as 500 grams over the true weight, then the scale would be very reliable, but it would not be valid (as the returned weight is not the true weight). For the scale to be valid, it should return the true weight of an object. This example demonstrates that a perfectly reliable measure is not necessarily valid, but that a valid measure necessarily must be reliable.

==General model==

In practice, testing measures are never perfectly consistent. Theories of test reliability have been developed to estimate the effects of inconsistency on the accuracy of measurement. The basic starting point for almost all theories of test reliability is the idea that test scores reflect the influence of two sorts of factors:

# Consistency factors: stable characteristics of the individual or the attribute that one is trying to measure.
# Inconsistency factors: features of the individual or the situation that can affect test scores but have nothing to do with the attribute being measured.

These factors include:
* Temporary but general characteristics of the individual: health, fatigue, motivation, emotional strain
* Temporary and specific characteristics of individual: comprehension of the specific test task, specific tricks or techniques of dealing with the particular test materials, fluctuations of memory, attention or accuracy
* Aspects of the testing situation: freedom from distractions, clarity of instructions, interaction of personality, etc. 
* Chance factors: luck in selection of answers by sheer guessing, momentary distractions

The goal of estimating reliability is to determine how much of the variability in test scores is due to measurement errors and how much is due to variability in &quot;true scores&quot; (&quot;true value&quot;).

A &quot;true score&quot; is the replicable feature of the concept being measured. It is the part of the observed score that would recur across different measurement occasions in the absence of error.

Errors of measurement are composed of both random error and systematic error. It represents the discrepancies between scores obtained on tests and the corresponding true scores.

This conceptual breakdown is typically represented by the simple equation:

formula_1 where X is the observed test score, T is the true score, and E is the measurement error

==Classical test theory==
The goal of reliability theory is to estimate errors in measurement and to suggest ways of improving tests so that errors are minimized.

The central assumption of reliability theory is that measurement errors are essentially random. This does not mean that errors arise from random processes. For any individual, an error in measurement is not a completely random event. However, across a large number of individuals, the causes of measurement error are assumed to be so varied that measure errors act as random variables.

If errors have the essential characteristics of random variables, then it is reasonable to assume that errors are equally likely to be positive or negative, and that they are not correlated with true scores or with errors on other tests.

It is assumed that:

# Mean error of measurement = 0
# True scores and errors are uncorrelated
# Errors on different measures are uncorrelated

Reliability theory shows that the variance of obtained scores is simply the sum of the variance of &quot;true scores&quot; plus the variance of &quot;errors of measurement&quot;.

: formula_2

This equation suggests that test scores vary as the result of two factors:

# Variability in true scores
# Variability due to errors of measurement.

The reliability coefficient formula_3 provides an index of the relative influence of true and error scores on attained test scores. In its general form, the reliability coefficient is defined as the ratio of &quot;true score&quot; variance to the total variance of test scores. Or, equivalently, one minus the ratio of the variation of the &quot;error score&quot; and the variation of the &quot;observed score&quot;:

: formula_4

Unfortunately, there is no way to directly observe or calculate the true score, so a variety of methods are used to estimate the reliability of a test.

Some examples of the methods to estimate reliability include test-retest reliability, internal consistency reliability, and &quot;parallel-test reliability&quot;. Each method comes at the problem of figuring out the source of error in the test somewhat differently.

==Item response theory==
It was well known to classical test theorists that measurement precision is not uniform across the scale of measurement. Tests tend to distinguish better for test-takers with moderate trait levels and worse among high- and low-scoring test-takers. Item response theory extends the concept of reliability from a single index to a function called the &quot;information function&quot;. The IRT information function is the inverse of the conditional observed score standard error at any given test score.

==Estimation==

The goal of estimating reliability is to determine how much of the variability in test scores is due to errors in measurement and how much is due to variability in true scores.

Four practical strategies have been developed that provide workable methods of estimating test reliability:

=== Test-rest reliability ===
The test-retest reliability method directly assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent from one test administration to the next. It involves:

* Administering a test to a group of individuals
* Re-administering the same test to the same group at some later time
* Correlating the first set of scores with the second

The correlation between scores on the first test and the scores on the retest is used to estimate the reliability of the test using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient: see also item-total correlation.

=== Parallel-forms method ===
The key to this method is the development of alternate test forms that are equivalent in terms of content, response processes and statistical characteristics. For example, alternate forms exist for several tests of general intelligence, and these tests are generally seen equivalent.

With the parallel test model it is possible to develop two forms of a test that are equivalent in the sense that a person&#x27;s true score on form A would be identical to their true score on form B. If both forms of the test were administered to a number of people, differences between scores on form A and form B may be due to errors in measurement only. It involves:

* Administering one form of the test to a group of individuals
* At some later time, administering an alternate form of the same test to the same group of people
* Correlating scores on form A with scores on form B

The correlation between scores on the two alternate forms is used to estimate the reliability of the test.

This method provides a partial solution to many of the problems inherent in the test-retest reliability method. For example, since the two forms of the test are different, carryover effect is less of a problem. Reactivity effects are also partially controlled; although taking the first test may change responses to the second test. However, it is reasonable to assume that the effect will not be as strong with alternate forms of the test as with two administrations of the same test.

However, this technique has its disadvantages:

* It may be very difficult to create several alternate forms of a test
* It may also be difficult if not impossible to guarantee that two alternate forms of a test are parallel measures

=== Split-half method ===
This method treats the two halves of a measure as alternate forms. It provides a simple solution to the problem that the parallel-forms method faces: the difficulty in developing alternate forms. It involves:

* Administering a test to a group of individuals
* Splitting the test in half
* Correlating scores on one half of the test with scores on the other half of the test

The correlation between these two split halves is used in estimating the reliability of the test. This halves reliability estimate is then stepped up to the full test length using the Spearman–Brown prediction formula.

There are several ways of splitting a test to estimate reliability. For example, a 40-item vocabulary test could be split into two subtests, the first one made up of items 1 through 20 and the second made up of items 21 through 40. However, the responses from the first half may be systematically different from responses in the second half due to an increase in item difficulty and fatigue.

In splitting a test, the two halves would need to be as similar as possible, both in terms of their content and in terms of the probable state of the respondent. The simplest method is to adopt an odd-even split, in which the odd-numbered items form one half of the test and the even-numbered items form the other. This arrangement guarantees that each half will contain an equal number of items from the beginning, middle, and end of the original test.

=== Internal consistency ===
Internal consistency assesses the consistency of results across items within a test. The most common internal consistency measure is Cronbach&#x27;s alpha, which is usually interpreted as the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Cronbach&#x27;s alpha is a generalization of an earlier form of estimating internal consistency, Kuder–Richardson Formula 20. Although the most commonly used, there are some misconceptions regarding Cronbach&#x27;s alpha.

These measures of reliability differ in their sensitivity to different sources of error and so need not be equal. Also, reliability is a property of the &quot;scores of a measure&quot; rather than the measure itself and are thus said to be &quot;sample dependent&quot;. Reliability estimates from one sample might differ from those of a second sample (beyond what might be expected due to sampling variations) if the second sample is drawn from a different population because the true variability is different in this second population. (This is true of measures of all types—yardsticks might measure houses well yet have poor reliability when used to measure the lengths of insects.)

Reliability may be improved by clarity of expression (for written assessments), lengthening the measure, and other informal means. However, formal psychometric analysis, called item analysis, is considered the most effective way to increase reliability. This analysis consists of computation of item difficulties and item discrimination indices, the latter index involving computation of correlations between the items and sum of the item scores of the entire test. If items that are too difficult, too easy, and/or have near-zero or negative discrimination are replaced with better items, the reliability of the measure will increase.

<text>Validity is the main extent to which a concept, conclusion, or measurement is well-founded and likely corresponds accurately to the real world. The word &quot;valid&quot; is derived from the Latin validus, meaning strong. The validity of a measurement tool (for example, a test in education) is the degree to which the tool measures what it claims to measure. Validity is based on the strength of a collection of different types of evidence (e.g. face validity, construct validity, etc.) described in greater detail below.

In psychometrics, validity has a particular application known as test validity: &quot;the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores&quot; (&quot;as entailed by proposed uses of tests&quot;).

It is generally accepted that the concept of scientific validity addresses the nature of reality in terms of statistical measures and as such is an epistemological and philosophical issue as well as a question of measurement. The use of the term in logic is narrower, relating to the relationship between the premises and conclusion of an argument. In logic, validity refers to the property of an argument whereby if the premises are true then the truth of the conclusion follows by necessity. The conclusion of an argument is true if the argument is sound, which is to say if the argument is valid and its premises are true. By contrast, &quot;scientific or statistical validity&quot; is not a deductive claim that is necessarily truth preserving, but is an inductive claim that remains true or false in an undecided manner. This is why &quot;scientific or statistical validity&quot; is a claim that is qualified as being either strong or weak in its nature, it is never necessary nor certainly true. This has the effect of making claims of &quot;scientific or statistical validity&quot; open to interpretation as to what, in fact, the facts of the matter mean.

Validity is important because it can help determine what types of tests to use, and help to ensure researchers are using methods that are not only ethical and cost-effective, but also those that truly measure the ideas or constructs in question.

==Test validity==
=== Validity (accuracy) ===
Validity of an assessment is the degree to which it measures what it is supposed to measure. This is not the same as reliability, which is the extent to which a measurement gives results that are very consistent. Within validity, the measurement does not always have to be similar, as it does in reliability. However, just because a measure is reliable, it is not necessarily valid. E.g. a scale that is 5 pounds off is reliable but not valid. A test cannot be valid unless it is reliable. Validity is also dependent on the measurement measuring what it was designed to measure, and not something else instead. Validity (similar to reliability) is a relative concept; validity is not an all-or-nothing idea. There are many different types of validity.

=== Construct validity ===

Construct validity refers to the extent to which operationalizations of a construct (e.g., practical tests developed from a theory) measure a construct as defined by a theory. It subsumes all other types of validity. For example, the extent to which a test measures intelligence is a question of construct validity. A measure of intelligence presumes, among other things, that the measure is associated with things it should be associated with (convergent validity), not associated with things it should not be associated with (discriminant validity).

Construct validity evidence involves the empirical and theoretical support for the interpretation of the construct. Such lines of evidence include statistical analyses of the internal structure of the test including the relationships between responses to different test items. They also include relationships between the test and measures of other constructs. As currently understood, construct validity is not distinct from the support for the substantive theory of the construct that the test is designed to measure. As such, experiments designed to reveal aspects of the causal role of the construct also contribute to constructing validity evidence.

=== Content validity ===
Content validity is a non-statistical type of validity that involves &quot;the systematic examination of the test content to determine whether it covers a representative sample of the behavior domain to be measured&quot; (Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997 p. 114). For example, does an IQ questionnaire have items covering all areas of intelligence discussed in the scientific literature?

Content validity evidence involves the degree to which the content of the test matches a content domain associated with the construct. For example, a test of the ability to add two numbers should include a range of combinations of digits. A test with only one-digit numbers, or only even numbers, would not have good coverage of the content domain. Content related evidence typically involves a subject matter expert (SME) evaluating test items against the test specifications. Experts should pay attention to any cultural differences. For example, when a driving assessment questionnaire adopts from England (e. g. DBQ), the experts should consider right-hand driving in Britain. Some studies found how this will be critical to get a valid questionnaire. Before going to the final administration of questionnaires, the researcher should consult the validity of items against each of the constructs or variables and accordingly modify measurement instruments on the basis of SME&#x27;s opinion.

A test has content validity built into it by careful selection of which items to include (Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997). Items are chosen so that they comply with the test specification which is drawn up through a thorough examination of the subject domain. Foxcroft, Paterson, le Roux &amp; Herbst (2004, p. 49) note that by using a panel of experts to review the test specifications and the selection of items the content validity of a test can be improved. The experts will be able to review the items and comment on whether the items cover a representative sample of the behavior domain.

==== Face validity ====
Face validity is an estimate of whether a test appears to measure a certain criterion; it does not guarantee that the test actually measures phenomena in that domain. Measures may have high validity, but when the test does not appear to be measuring what it is, it has low face validity. Indeed, when a test is subject to faking (malingering), low face validity might make the test more valid. Considering one may get more honest answers with lower face validity, it is sometimes important to make it appear as though there is low face validity whilst administering the measures.

Face validity is very closely related to content validity. While content validity depends on a theoretical basis for assuming if a test is assessing all domains of a certain criterion (e.g. does assessing addition skills yield in a good measure for mathematical skills? To answer this you have to know, what different kinds of arithmetic skills mathematical skills include) face validity relates to whether a test appears to be a good measure or not. This judgment is made on the &quot;face&quot; of the test, thus it can also be judged by the amateur.

Face validity is a starting point, but should never be assumed to be probably valid for any given purpose, as the &quot;experts&quot; have been wrong before—the Malleus Malificarum (Hammer of Witches) had no support for its conclusions other than the self-imagined competence of two &quot;experts&quot; in &quot;witchcraft detection&quot;, yet it was used as a &quot;test&quot; to condemn and burn at the stake tens of thousands men and women as &quot;witches&quot;.

=== Criterion validity ===
Criterion validity evidence involves the correlation between the test and a criterion variable (or variables) taken as representative of the construct. In other words, it compares the test with other measures or outcomes (the criteria) already held to be valid. For example, employee selection tests are often validated against measures of job performance (the criterion), and IQ tests are often validated against measures of academic performance (the criterion).

If the test data and criterion data are collected at the same time, this is referred to as concurrent validity evidence. If the test data are collected first in order to predict criterion data collected at a later point in time, then this is referred to as predictive validity evidence.

==== Concurrent validity ====
Concurrent validity refers to the degree to which the operationalization correlates with other measures of the same construct that are measured at the same time. When the measure is compared to another measure of the same type, they will be related (or correlated). Returning to the selection test example, this would mean that the tests are administered to current employees and then correlated with their scores on performance reviews.

==== Predictive validity ====
Predictive validity refers to the degree to which the operationalization can predict (or correlate with) other measures of the same construct that are measured at some time in the future. Again, with the selection test example, this would mean that the tests are administered to applicants, all applicants are hired, their performance is reviewed at a later time, and then their scores on the two measures are correlated.

This is also when measurement predicts a relationship between what is measured and something else; predicting whether or not the other thing will happen in the future. High correlation between ex-ante predicted and ex-post actual outcomes is the strongest proof of validity.
== Experimental validity ==
The validity of the design of experimental research studies is a fundamental part of the scientific method, and a concern of research ethics. Without a valid design, valid scientific conclusions cannot be drawn.

===Statistical conclusion validity===
Statistical conclusion validity is the degree to which conclusions about the relationship among variables based on the data are correct or &#x27;reasonable&#x27;. This began as being solely about whether the statistical conclusion about the relationship of the variables was correct, but now there is a movement towards moving to &#x27;reasonable&#x27; conclusions that use: quantitative, statistical, and qualitative data.

Statistical conclusion validity involves ensuring the use of adequate sampling procedures, appropriate statistical tests, and reliable measurement procedures. As this type of validity is concerned solely with the relationship that is found among variables, the relationship may be solely a correlation.

=== Internal validity ===
Internal validity is an inductive estimate of the degree to which conclusions about &quot;causal&quot; relationships can be made (e.g. cause and effect), based on the measures used, the research setting, and the whole research design. Good experimental techniques, in which the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable is studied under highly controlled conditions, usually allow for higher degrees of internal validity than, for example, single-case designs.

Eight kinds of confounding variable can interfere with internal validity (i.e. with the attempt to isolate causal relationships):
#History, the specific events occurring between the first and second measurements in addition to the experimental variables
#Maturation, processes within the participants as a function of the passage of time (not specific to particular events), e.g., growing older, hungrier, more tired, and so on.
#Testing, the effects of taking a test upon the scores of a second testing.
#Instrumentation, changes in calibration of a measurement tool or changes in the observers or scorers may produce changes in the obtained measurements.
#Statistical regression, operating where groups have been selected on the basis of their extreme scores.
#Selection, biases resulting from differential selection of respondents for the comparison groups.
#Experimental mortality, or differential loss of respondents from the comparison groups.
#Selection-maturation interaction, etc. e.g., in multiple-group quasi-experimental designs

=== External validity ===
External validity concerns the extent to which the (internally valid) results of a study can be held to be true for other cases, for example to different people, places or times. In other words, it is about whether findings can be validly generalized. If the same research study was conducted in those other cases, would it get the same results?

A major factor in this is whether the study sample (e.g. the research participants) are representative of the general population along relevant dimensions. Other factors jeopardizing external validity are:

#Reactive or interaction effect of testing, a pretest might increase the scores on a posttest
#Interaction effects of selection biases and the experimental variable.
#Reactive effects of experimental arrangements, which would preclude generalization about the effect of the experimental variable upon persons being exposed to it in non-experimental settings
#Multiple-treatment interference, where effects of earlier treatments are not erasable.

==== Ecological validity ====
Ecological validity is the extent to which research results can be applied to real-life situations outside of research settings. This issue is closely related to external validity but covers the question of to what degree experimental findings mirror what can be observed in the real world (ecology = the science of interaction between organism and its environment). To be ecologically valid, the methods, materials and setting of a study must approximate the real-life situation that is under investigation.

Ecological validity is partly related to the issue of experiment versus observation. Typically in science, there are two domains of research: observational (passive) and experimental (active). The purpose of experimental designs is to test causality, so that you can infer A causes B or B causes A. But sometimes, ethical and/or methological restrictions prevent you from conducting an experiment (e.g. how does isolation influence a child&#x27;s cognitive functioning?). Then you can still do research, but it is not causal, it is correlational. You can only conclude that A occurs together with B. Both techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.

====Relationship to internal validity====
On first glance, internal and external validity seem to contradict each other – to get an experimental design you have to control for all interfering variables. That is why you often conduct your experiment in a laboratory setting. While gaining internal validity (excluding interfering variables by keeping them constant) you lose ecological or external validity because you establish an artificial laboratory setting. On the other hand, with observational research you can not control for interfering variables (low internal validity) but you can measure in the natural (ecological) environment, at the place where behavior normally occurs. However, in doing so, you sacrifice internal validity.

The apparent contradiction of internal validity and external validity is, however, only superficial. The question of whether results from a particular study generalize to other people, places or times arises only when one follows an inductivist research strategy. If the goal of a study is to deductively test a theory, one is only concerned with factors which might undermine the rigor of the study, i.e. threats to internal validity. In other words, the relevance of external and internal validity to a research study depends on the goals of the study. Furthermore, conflating research goals with validity concerns can lead to the mutual-internal-validity problem, where theories are able to explain only phenomena in artificial laboratory settings but not the real world.

==Diagnostic validity==
In psychiatry there is a particular issue with assessing the validity of the diagnostic categories themselves. In this context:
*content validity may refer to symptoms and diagnostic criteria;
*concurrent validity may be defined by various correlates or markers, and perhaps also treatment response;
*predictive validity may refer mainly to diagnostic stability over time;
*discriminant validity may involve delimitation from other disorders.

Robins and Guze proposed in 1970 what were to become influential formal criteria for establishing the validity of psychiatric diagnoses. They listed five criteria:
* distinct clinical description (including symptom profiles, demographic characteristics, and typical precipitants)
* laboratory studies (including psychological tests, radiology and postmortem findings)
* delimitation from other disorders (by means of exclusion criteria)
* follow-up studies showing a characteristic course (including evidence of diagnostic stability)
* family studies showing familial clustering

These were incorporated into the Feighner Criteria and Research Diagnostic Criteria that have since formed the basis of the DSM and ICD classification systems.

Kendler in 1980 distinguished between:

*antecedent validators (familial aggregation, premorbid personality, and precipitating factors)
*concurrent validators (including psychological tests)
*predictive validators (diagnostic consistency over time, rates of relapse and recovery, and response to treatment)

Nancy Andreasen (1995) listed several additional validators – molecular genetics and molecular biology, neurochemistry, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and cognitive neuroscience – that are all potentially capable of linking symptoms and diagnoses to their neural substrates.

Kendell and Jablinsky (2003) emphasized the importance of distinguishing between validity and utility, and argued that diagnostic categories defined by their syndromes should be regarded as valid only if they have been shown to be discrete entities with natural boundaries that separate them from other disorders.

Kendler (2006) emphasized that to be useful, a validating criterion must be sensitive enough to validate most syndromes that are true disorders, while also being specific enough to invalidate most syndromes that are not true disorders. On this basis, he argues that a Robins and Guze criterion of &quot;runs in the family&quot; is inadequately specific because most human psychological and physical traits would qualify - for example, an arbitrary syndrome comprising a mixture of &quot;height over 6 ft, red hair, and a large nose&quot; will be found to &quot;run in families&quot; and be &quot;hereditary&quot;, but this should not be considered evidence that it is a disorder. Kendler has further suggested that &quot;essentialist&quot; gene models of psychiatric disorders, and the hope that we will be able to validate categorical psychiatric diagnoses by &quot;carving nature at its joints&quot; solely as a result of gene discovery, are implausible.

In the United States Federal Court System validity and reliability of evidence is evaluated using the Daubert Standard: see Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals. Perri and Lichtenwald (2010) provide a starting point for a discussion about a wide range of reliability and validity topics in their analysis of a wrongful murder conviction.

<doc id="239142" wikidata="Q1780164" url="?curid=239142" title="Poldark">
<text>Poldark is a series of historical novels by Winston Graham, initially published from 1945 to 1953 and continuing from 1973 to 2002. The first novel, &quot;Ross Poldark&quot;, was named for the protagonist of the series. The novel series was adapted for television by the BBC in 1975 and again in 2015. 

==Historical setting==
The series comprises 12 novels: the first seven are set in the 18th century, concluding in Christmas 1799; the remaining five are concerned with the early years of the 19th century and the lives of the descendants of the previous novels&#x27; main characters. Graham wrote the first four &quot;Poldark&quot; books during the 1940s and 1950s. Following a long hiatus, he decided to resume the series and published &quot;The Black Moon&quot; in 1973.

==Novels==
Each of the novels is subtitled &quot;A Novel of Cornwall&quot;. In a preface to &quot;The Black Moon&quot;, Graham explained his decision to revive the series after a two-decade hiatus.

==Main characters==

===Ross Poldark===
Ross Poldark is the eponymous protagonist of the series. He is a British Army officer who returns to his home in Cornwall from the American War of Independence only to find that Elizabeth Chynoweth, having told him she believed him dead, is about to marry his cousin Francis Poldark. Ross attempts to restore his own fortunes by reopening one of the family&#x27;s derelict copper mines.

Gradually reconciled to the loss of Elizabeth&#x27;s love, four years later Ross marries Demelza Carne, an urchin he has taken in as a servant. Although he did not marry her for love he falls in love with her six weeks afterwards. Despite this it is for some time that Ross has unresolved feelings for Elizabeth. A night with Elizabeth after she has become a widow causes Ross to eventually declare that Demelza was not second best and his real love is for her and not Elizabeth. 

Over 20 years, Ross and Demelza have five children: Julia, Jeremy, Clowance, Isabella-Rose (called Bella), and Henry (called Harry).

===Demelza Poldark, née Carne===
Taken home from Redruth Fair by Ross, miner&#x27;s daughter Demelza and her dog Garrick have an unpromising start. However, she soon develops into a charming, amusing, lovely young woman, eventually winning Ross&#x27;s affection. Dark and earthy, she is the total opposite of the fragile Elizabeth. The two women are wary but polite towards each other. Demelza shows courage and fierce loyalty to Ross but is somewhat impulsive, causing trouble for both of them. She has six brothers.

===Dr. Dwight Enys===
A young physician who arrives in Cornwall after medical training in London. He strikes up a firm friendship with Ross which proves strong and enduring. He is conscientious and generous, often not charging his poorest patients for his services. He becomes involved with a young miner&#x27;s wife with tragic results. After his rescue from a French prison camp in late 1794, he eventually marries a young heiress, Lady Caroline Penvenen, and they become parents to a frail daughter named Sarah Caroline who had died in 1798. In the eleven-year time gap, they have two more daughters named Sophie and Meliora.

===Caroline Enys, née Penvenen===
Caroline is an orphan, taken in and brought up by her rich uncle, Ray. Strong-willed and independent, she begins a romance with Dwight Enys against her uncle&#x27;s wishes, culminating in a disastrous plan to elope. They eventually marry after Dwight&#x27;s rescue from a prison camp in France. Caroline and Dwight&#x27;s first daughter, Sarah, has a congenital heart defect and dies in infancy. Two more daughters, Sophie and Meliora, follow.

=== Elizabeth Poldark (née Chynoweth) now Warleggan ===

She was Ross Poldark&#x27;s very first love and he hers. Whilst they were both teenagers she agreed to wait for him to return from the war in America so that they would marry. Whilst away Elizabeth began a courtship with Ross&#x27;s cousin Francis. Believing herself to be in love with Francis and alongside unconfirmed rumours of Ross&#x27;s death at war, she accepted Francis&#x27;s proposal of marriage. Ross is disappointed to return to Cornwall on the night of her engagement party. The marriage to Francis became a failure. After 10 years of marriage Francis dies and Elizabeth struggles with poverty and loneliness. She eventually accepts Ross&#x27;s worst enemy, a very rich man, George Warleggan as her husband. She has two sons: one with Francis (Geoffrey Charles), and the other supposedly with George (Valentine). She later has a daughter with George called Ursula, but Elizabeth dies days after giving birth to her. 

Between Elizabeth&#x27;s betrothal to George and the wedding, Ross in anger pays her a visit and has sex with her. The incident is controversial as she maintained it was against her wishes whilst he takes the view it was no so much against her wishes after the initial shock. It was established in &quot;The Angry Tide&quot; that Valentine was Ross&#x27;s son although Elizabeth always led George to believe Valentine was his. Valentine&#x27;s paternity proves to be a source of tension in her 6-year marriage to George.

&quot;Though Elizabeth had been constitutionally strong enough, perhaps some exhaustion in the ancient Chynoweth strain was to be the cause of this virtual obliteration of her personal appearance in any of her children, and the dominance of the three fathers. Geoffrey Charles was already like Francis. Valentine would grow ever more like the man who had just left the house. And little Ursula would become sturdy and strong and thick-necked and as determined as a blacksmith.&quot;

Graham, Winston. &quot;The Angry Tide: A Novel of Cornwall 1798–1799&quot; (Poldark Book 7) (p. 602). Pan Macmillan. Kindle Edition.

===George Warleggan===
Ross&#x27;s arch-enemy is of a new class of industrialists and bankers. Although regarded as an upstart by the aristocracy, through ruthlessness and cunning he becomes increasingly powerful. Always impeccably dressed and elegantly behaved, he constantly schemes to increase his own wealth at the expense of others, including the Poldarks. He becomes enamoured of Elizabeth, eventually marrying her after she is widowed, and they have two children, Valentine and Ursula. He also becomes a member of Parliament. Eventually, several years after Elizabeth&#x27;s death, he remarries a wealthy woman named Harriet (who is very fond of her large pet dogs, much to George&#x27;s disdain), and they have twin daughters.

===Francis Poldark===
Ross&#x27;s cousin Francis has a tendency to be flippant but his feelings are strong and he can be very obstinate. The two cousins were friends as boys but their relationship is tested severely when Francis marries Elizabeth, with lasting repercussions for them all. He has one son with Elizabeth - Geoffrey Charles Poldark, and later dies in a tragic accident in his mine.

===Verity Blamey, née Poldark===
Francis&#x27;s sister and Ross&#x27;s cousin Verity is described as plain, with fluffy hair and a mobile mouth. She has been a dutiful, unmarried daughter who looks after the affairs of her father, Charles Poldark, and his estate. She meets and falls in love with Andrew Blamey, a sea captain. Unfortunately he has a terrible secret that is soon revealed, and she seems to lose her chance of happiness. Eventually Andrew and Verity marry, and she becomes friends with his first children - Esther and James, Andrew and Verity later have one child - a son named Andrew.

===The Reverend Osborne Whitworth===
Osborne Whitworth appears briefly in the first &quot;Poldark&quot; series of novels, but comes to feature prominently in the second series when he marries Morwenna Chynoweth, Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin, who is in love with Drake Carne, Demelza&#x27;s brother. Whitworth&#x27;s main preoccupations are money and women. He is loud and arrogant, delivering sermons which intimidate his parishioners more than inspire them. He also sexually abuses his wife; when he is no longer able to force himself upon her during her pregnancy, he begins an affair with her fifteen-year-old sister, Rowella, which proves to be his undoing. He has a son, named John Conan, and two daughters with his first wife.

===Drake Carne===
The brother of Demelza Poldark and Sam Carne, he comes to stay with Ross and Demelza after his father&#x27;s death and encounters Geoffrey Charles Poldark and his governess Morwenna Chynoweth. He forms a close friendship with Geoffrey Charles and falls in love with Morwenna yet she is forced by George Warleggan to marry Osborne Whitworth. He becomes a blacksmith and later when Osborne Whitworth dies he does marry Morwenna and they have a child named Loveday, when Geoffrey Charles returns to Cornwall from Spain they continue their friendship with him.

===Jeremy Poldark===
Jeremy Poldark is the second child of Ross and Demelza Poldark, he features heavily in the later books, having interests in his fathers&#x27;s mines and in early forms of cars. He falls in love with a local noblewoman, Cuby Trevanion, who continuously rejects him as she is expected to marry into a richer family, but eventually she realises she loves him and they run away together. Jeremy and Cuby then go to France where he fights in the army and then dies at Waterloo, leaving Cuby devastated and a pregnant widow.

===Valentine Warleggan===
The son of Elizabeth Warleggan (née Chynoweth &amp; Poldark) and George Warleggan, although it is later acknowledged that he is likely the illegitimate son of Elizabeth and Ross Poldark when he had assaulted her upon their argument over her engagement to George. In the later novels he goes about drinking and gambling and being an all round rather bad influence especially on Andrew Blamey (the son of Verity Blamey (née Poldark) and Andrew Blamey). He also marries a rich widow (Selina Pope) and has many secret affairs. He does eventually ask Ross if he is his father, but gets no direct answer from him. However, Valentine is clever enough to deduce some things, but things continue as before. He ultimately dies in a fire trying to save his chimpanzee companion.

===Clowance Poldark===
The third child of Ross and Demelza, she has flirtations with the miner Ben Carter (son of Jim and Jinny (née Martin) Carter) and various noblemen, yet she marries the mysterious Stephen Carrington, the title character of &quot;The Stranger from the Sea,&quot; while unaware of his history of murder of his ex-wife Violet and son Jason. Eventually his so-called ex-wife was still alive when he married Clowance, making him a bigamist and the marriage invalid.

===Stephen Carrington===
A character who first appears in &quot;The Stranger from the Sea&quot;. He&#x27;s a rather suspicious character who marries Clowance Poldark, despite his history of murder and first wife he announces is dead, but it is later found that his wife was alive when he married Clowance- rendering their marriage void. He embarks on various schemes including one he enacts with Jeremy Poldark and Paul Kellow in which they break into a carriage and steal some jewels and money - some of it belonging to George Warleggan and his new wife Harriet Warleggan. He then becomes involved in trading vessels and missions to Europe. His undoing is a flirtation with Harriet Warleggan which ends in him falling off his horse into a ditch and breaking his back.

===Geoffrey Charles Poldark===
The first son of Elizabeth Poldark and only child of Francis Poldark. He almost dies of the &#x27;putrid throat&#x27; (diphtheria) as an infant and is nursed back to health by Demelza at the cost of Demelza and Ross Poldark&#x27;s first child - Julia. Later he forms a close friendship with Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin Morwenna and Demelza&#x27;s brother Drake. He is sent away to school by his new step-father George Warleggan and later joins the army. He encounters his uncle Ross Poldark at war in Portugal and eventually returns to Cornwall and his home at Trenwith. He marries a woman named Amadora who he met in Spain and they eventually have two daughters, Joanna &quot;Juana&quot; and Carla.

===Isabella &quot;Bella&quot; Rose Poldark===
The fourth child and youngest daughter of Ross and Demelza Poldark. She has a love of music and singing and gains a reputation for being musically talented.

==Television adaptations of the novels==

*The BBC adapted the first seven books of the novel sequence as &quot;Poldark&quot;, first broadcast in 1975 (a series of 16 episodes) and in 1976–77 (a second series of 13 episodes). Robin Ellis portrayed Ross and Angharad Rees was featured as Demelza.
*In 1996, HTV produced a pilot episode of &quot;The Stranger from the Sea&quot;, written by Robin Mukherjee, which became a controversial adaptation using a new cast featuring John Bowe as Ross Poldark and Mel Martin as Demelza. Fans protested, and over fifty members of the Poldark Appreciation Society picketed HTV&#x27;s headquarters in Bristol wearing 18th-century costumes. The pilot was unsuccessful, and no further episodes were made.
*The BBC began broadcasting a new adaptation of the novels (the first seven books) in 2015, again titled &quot;Poldark&quot;, with Aidan Turner in the title role and Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza. Like the original 1975 BBC adaptation, this new series has been taken up by the PBS network for broadcast in the United States. This adaptation was broadcast by the BBC in five series, with the last episode of series 5 broadcast on 26 August 2019.

==People who inspired the characters==

* Graham mentions in his autobiography &quot;Memoirs of a Private Man&quot; that the character of Demelza is based on his own wife Jean, at least in part.
* Graham states in &quot;Poldark&#x27;s Cornwall&quot; that the Bodmin Moor hamlet of Demelza, in the parish of St Wenn, was the inspiration for his character&#x27;s first name.
* In &quot;Poldark&#x27;s Cornwall&quot;, Graham reveals that the name &quot;Poldark&quot; is a product of his imagination. He initially named the character after his friend, a chemist named Polgreen. However, Polgreen did not sound strong or mysterious enough for the character, so Graham changed Polgreen to Poldark.
* In his autobiography, Graham states that Ross Poldark&#x27;s physical characteristics are based upon those of an injured flying officer whom Graham met on a train during the Second World War.
* Regarding Elizabeth&#x27;s character Graham told &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine &quot;She&#x27;s not really a very nice character so, although there was a model for her, I&#x27;d prefer not to say who.&quot;

==Allusions to historical events and real places==
In his autobiography &quot;Memoirs of a Private Man&quot;, Graham explains that some of the stories and plots in the book draw from actual people and events from Cornish history. According to Graham, the names of the original people and places (and sometimes the dates) have been adapted or changed, but essentially the material facts remain the same.
Some examples that Winston Graham used are:
*The story of the physician (Dr. Enys) who was called out to attend a young girl&#x27;s (Caroline Penvenen) dog.
*The incident with the fishbone where (Caroline) believes she has the putrid throat, and eventually Dr Enys is called out to her, removing a fishbone to cure her.
*The fifth Poldark novel, &quot;Black Moon&quot;, is set between 1794 and 1795. A total lunar eclipse visible from the UK occurred on 14 February 1794 and is the inspiration for the title. The &quot;black moon&quot; occurs on the day of Valentine Warleggan&#x27;s birth and he is named after 14 February, Valentine&#x27;s Day. The ending of the lunar eclipse is erroneously depicted. Astronomically, the Earth&#x27;s shadow is concave towards the dark portion of the Moon&#x27;s surface, throughout the eclipse. In the &quot;Black moon&quot; episode, as the eclipse ends, the Earth&#x27;s shadow is concave towards the light portion of the Moon&#x27;s surface.
*Hendrawna is his name for Perranporth.
*Graham&#x27;s source material for his description of Launceston Gaol was taken from John Howard&#x27;s &quot;The State of Prisons in England and Wales&quot; published in 1777. Graham used the reissued 1784 edition.
Real historical characters are woven into the narrative, for example Ross and Demelza&#x27;s son Jeremy becomes besotted with Cuby, the fictional sister of John Bettesworth-Trevanion, a real Cornish politician who fled the debts he accumulated rebuilding Caerhays Castle. Trevanion&#x27;s struggles with debt, efforts to marry his sisters to money and flight to Paris are all detailed plot points in the text.

==Publication history==
* The first novel &quot;Ross Poldark&quot;, was published in the UK in 1945. Upon re-publication in the US in 1951, it was retitled &quot;The Renegade&quot;, and significantly shortened by approximately 12%, with most editions since then using the shorter, revised text.
* The second novel, &quot;Demelza&quot;, was published in the UK in 1946. Upon re-publication in the US in 1953, it was also significantly shortened, by approximately 14%, with editions since then using the shorter text.

<text>Isaac Watts (17 July 1674 – 25 November 1748) was an English Congregational minister, hymn writer, theologian, and logician. He was a prolific and popular hymn writer and is credited with some 750 hymns. His works include &quot;When I Survey the Wondrous Cross&quot;, &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, and &quot;O God, Our Help in Ages Past&quot;. He is recognised as the &quot;Godfather of English Hymnody&quot;; many of his hymns remain in use today and have been translated into numerous languages.

==Life==

Watts was born in Southampton, Hampshire, England, in 1674 and was brought up in the home of a committed religious nonconformist; his father, also Isaac Watts, had been incarcerated twice for his views. Watts had a classical education at King Edward VI School, Southampton, learning Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

Watts displayed a propensity for rhyme from an early age. He was once asked why he had his eyes open during prayers, to which he responded:
He received corporal punishment for this, to which he cried:
Watts could not attend Oxford or Cambridge because he was a nonconformist and these universities were restricted to Anglicans—as were government positions at the time. He went to the Dissenting Academy at Stoke Newington in 1690. Much of the remainder of his life centred on that village, which is now part of Inner London.

Following his education, Watts was called as pastor of a large independent chapel in London, Mark Lane Congregational Chapel, where he helped train preachers, despite his poor health. He held religious opinions that were more nondenominational or ecumenical than was common for a nonconformist Congregationalist. He had a greater interest in promoting education and scholarship than preaching for any particular sect.

Watts took work as a private tutor and lived with the nonconformist Hartopp family at Fleetwood House on Church Street in Stoke Newington. Through them, he became acquainted with their immediate neighbours Sir Thomas Abney and Lady Mary. He eventually lived for a total of 36 years in the Abney household, most of the time at Abney House, their second residence. (Lady Mary had inherited the manor of Stoke Newington in 1701 from her late brother Thomas Gunston.)

On the death of Sir Thomas Abney in 1722, his widow Lady Mary and her unmarried daughter Elizabeth moved all her household to Abney House from Hertfordshire, and she invited Watts to continue with them. He particularly enjoyed the grounds at Abney Park, which Lady Mary planted with two elm walks leading down to an island heronry in the Hackney Brook, and he often sought inspiration there for the many books and hymns that he wrote.

Watts lived at Abney Hall in Stoke Newington until his death in 1748; he was buried in Bunhill Fields. He left an extensive legacy of hymns, treatises, educational works, and essays. His work was influential amongst nonconformist independents and religious revivalists of the 18th century, such as Philip Doddridge, who dedicated his best-known work to Watts.

==Watts and hymnody==
Sacred music scholars Stephen Marini, Denny Prutow and Michael LeFebvre describe the ways in which Watts contributed to English hymnody and the previous tradition of the Church. Watts led the change in practice by including new poetry for &quot;original songs of Christian experience&quot; to be used in worship, according to Marini. The older tradition was based on the poetry of the Bible: the Psalms. According to LeFebvre, Psalms had been sung by God&#x27;s people from the time of King David, who with a large staff over many years assembled the complete book of Psalms in a form appropriate for singing (by the Levites, during Temple sacrifices at the time). The practice of singing Psalms in worship was continued by Biblical command in the New Testament Church from its beginnings in Acts through the time of Watts, as documented by Prutow. The teachings of 16th-century Reformation leaders such as John Calvin, who translated the Psalms in the vernacular for congregational singing, followed this historic worship practice. Watts was not the first Protestant to promote the singing of hymns; however, his prolific hymn writing helped usher in a new era of English worship as many other poets followed in his path.

Watts also introduced a new way of rendering the Psalms in verse for church services, proposing that they be adapted for hymns with a specifically Christian perspective. As Watts put it in the title of his 1719 metrical Psalter, the Psalms should be &quot;imitated in the language of the New Testament.&quot; Besides writing hymns, Isaac Watts was also a theologian and logician, writing books and essays on these subjects. Isaac Watts is credited by many with introducing hymns to the English churches when his Hymns and Spiritual Songs was first published in 1707. They are extensively used today due to his poetic gifts, but also because he interpreted the Old Testament using knowledge of the New. This set an example for later hymn writers. Isaac Watts explained his methods as follows:
“Where the Psalmist describes religion by the fear of God, I have often joined faith and love to it. Where he speaks of pardon of sin through the mercies of God, I have added the merits of a Saviour. Where he talks of sacrificing goats and bullocks, I rather mention the sacrifice of Christ, the Lamb of God. When he attends the ark with shouting into Zion, I sing of the ascension of my Saviour into heaven, or His presence in His church on earth. Where he promises abundance of wealth, honour, and long life, I have changed some of these typical blessings for grace, glory, and life eternal, which are brought to light in the Gospel, and promised in the New Testament.”

== Logic and science ==

Watts wrote a textbook on logic which was particularly popular; its full title was, &quot;Logick, or The Right Use of Reason in the Enquiry After Truth With a Variety of Rules to Guard Against Error in the Affairs of Religion and Human Life, as well as in the Sciences&quot;. This was first published in 1724, and it was printed in twenty editions.

Watts wrote this work for beginners of logic, and arranged the book methodically. He divided the content of his elementary treatment of logic into four parts: perception, judgement, reasoning, and , which he treated in this order. Each of these parts is divided into chapters, and some of these chapters are divided into sections. The content of the chapters and sections is subdivided by the following devices: divisions, distributions, notes, observations, directions, rules, illustrations, and remarks. Every contentum of the book comes under one or more of these headings, and this methodical arrangement serves to make the exposition clear.

In Watts&#x27; &quot;Logic,&quot; there are notable departures from other works of the time, and some notable innovations. The influence of British empiricism may be seen, especially that of contemporary philosopher and empiricist John Locke. &quot;Logic&quot; includes several references to Locke and his &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, in which he espoused his empiricist views. Watts was careful to distinguish between judgements and propositions, unlike some other logic authors. According to Watts, judgement is &quot;to compare... ideas together, and to join them by affirmation, or disjoin then by negation, according as we find them to agree or disagree&quot;. He continues, &quot;when mere ideas are joined in the mind without words, it is rather called a judgement; but when clothed with words it is called a proposition&quot;. Watts&#x27; &quot;Logic&quot; follows the scholastic tradition and divides propositions into universal affirmative, universal negative, particular affirmative, and particular negative.

In the third part, Watts discusses reasoning and argumentation, with particular emphasis on the theory of syllogism. This was considered a centrally important part of classical logic. According to Watts, and in keeping with logicians of his day, Watts defined logic as an art (see liberal arts), as opposed to a science. Throughout &quot;Logic,&quot; Watts revealed his high conception of logic by stressing the practical side of logic, rather than the speculative side. According to Watts, as a practical art, logic can be really useful in any inquiry, whether it is an inquiry in the arts, or inquiry in the sciences, or inquiry of an ethical kind. Watts&#x27; emphasis on logic as a practical art distinguishes his book from others.

By stressing a practical and non-formal part of logic, Watts gave rules and directions for any kind of inquiry, including the inquiries of science and the inquiries of philosophy. These rules of inquiry were given in addition to the formal content of classical logic common to textbooks on logic from that time. Watts&#x27; conception of logic as being divided into its practical part and its speculative part marks a departure from the conception of logic of most other authors. His conception of logic is more akin to that of the later, nineteenth-century logician, C. S. Peirce.

Isaac Watts&#x27; &quot;Logic&quot; became the standard text on logic at Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and Yale, being used at Oxford for well over 100 years. Charles Sanders Peirce, the nineteenth-century logician, wrote favourably of Watts&#x27; &quot;Logic&quot;. When preparing his own textbook, titled &quot;A Critick of Arguments: How to Reason&quot; (also known as the &quot;Grand Logic&quot;), Peirce wrote, &quot;I shall suppose the reader to be acquainted with what is contained in Dr Watts&#x27; &quot;Logick&quot;, a book... far superior to the treatises now used in colleges, being the production of a man distinguished for good sense.&quot;

Watts followed the &quot;Logic&quot; in 1741 by a supplement, &quot;The Improvement of the Mind.&quot; This also went through numerous editions and later inspired Michael Faraday. It was also widely used as a moral textbook in schools.

=== &quot;Element&quot; vs. &quot;compound&quot; ===

In &quot;Logic&quot;, Watts gave an early definition of chemical element, and contrasted &quot;element&quot; with chemical &quot;compound&quot; in clear, modern terms. He also provided an early list of elements then recognized by chemists—five in number—as he understood it. Watts did also, however, note the lack of consensus among chemists.

==Legacy, honours and memorials==


On his death, Isaac Watts&#x27; papers were given to Yale University in the Colony of Connecticut, which nonconformists (Puritans/Congregationalists) had established. King Edward VI School, Southampton, which he attended, named one of its houses &quot;Watts&quot; in his honour.

The Church of England and Lutheran Church remember Watts (and his ministerial service) annually in the Calendar of Saints with a commemoration on 25 November.

The earliest surviving monument to Watts is in Westminster Abbey; this was completed shortly after his death. His much-visited chest tomb at Bunhill Fields dates from 1808, replacing the original that had been paid for and erected by Lady Mary Abney and the Hartopp family.

Another early memorial may be lost: a bust to Watts commissioned on his death for the London chapel with which he was associated. The chapel was demolished in the late 18th century: remaining parts of the memorial were rescued at the last minute by a wealthy landowner for installation in his chapel near Liverpool, but it is not known whether the bust survives. Another bust is installed at the nonconformist Dr Williams&#x27;s Library, in central London.

The first public statue stands at Abney Park, where Watts lived for more than 30 years at the manor house, and where he also died. The park later became Abney Park Cemetery, opened in 1840; and the statue of Watts was erected here by public subscription in 1845. It stands in Dr Watts&#x27; Walk, in front of the Abney Park Chapel, and was designed by the leading British sculptor, Edward Hodges Baily. A scheme for a commemorative statue on this spot had been promoted in the late 1830s by George Collison, who in 1840 published an engraving as the frontispiece of his book about cemetery design in Europe and America, and at Abney Park in particular. Collison&#x27;s proposal was never commissioned, and Baily&#x27;s design was adopted instead.

A later, rather similar statue was also funded by public subscription and erected in a new Victorian public park named after Watts in Southampton, the city of his birth. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Congregational Dr Watts Memorial Hall was built in Southampton and also named after him. It was lost to redevelopment after the Second World War, but the Isaac Watts Memorial United Reformed Church was built on the site.

In 1974, the City of Southampton commemorated the tercentenary of Watts&#x27; birth by commissioning the biography &quot;Isaac Watts Remembered&quot;, written by David G. Fountain, who like Watts, was a nonconformist minister from Southampton. The clock on Southampton Civic Centre chimes the tune of the opening line of &#x27;Our God, our help in ages past&#x27;, three times a day, at 8am, 12noon and 4pm.

==Cultural or contemporary influences==
In his novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), Charles Dickens has school master Dr. Strong quote from Watts&#x27; &quot;Against Idleness and Mischief&quot;.

In Herman Melville&#x27;s epic novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851), a minor investor in the whaling ship &quot;Pequod&quot; is Charity Bildad, &quot;a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted&quot; (chapter 20). Her brother, the captain, had forbidden the sailors to sing &quot;profane songs&quot; such as sea shanties, so she &quot;placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth&quot; (chapter 22).

One of Watts&#x27; best-known poems was an exhortation &quot;&quot; in &quot;Divine Songs for Children.&quot; This was parodied by Lewis Carroll in the poem &quot;How Doth the Little Crocodile&quot;, included in Chapter 2 of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865). His parody is better known than Watts&#x27; original poem. The poem was also featured in the segment on the cartoon programme &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; called &quot;Bullwinkle&#x27;s Corner&quot;, in which Bullwinkle Moose recites poetry. In this case, the poem was titled &quot;The Bee&quot;, with no author credit. A second example appears in Chapter 10 of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, the poem &quot;&#x27;Tis the Voice of the Lobster&quot;, which parodies the opening lines of &quot;&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Tis the voice of the sluggard; I heard him complain, / &#x27;You have waked me too soon, I must slumber again.&#x27;&quot;

The 1884 comic opera &quot;Princess Ida&quot; includes a punning reference to Watts in Act I. At Princess Ida&#x27;s women&#x27;s university, no men are allowed. Her father King Gama says that &quot;She&#x27;ll scarcely suffer Dr. Watts&#x27; &#x27;hymns&#x27;&quot;.

A poem often referred to as &quot;False Greatness&quot; by Joseph Merrick (&quot;The Elephant Man&quot;), which was used in writing or &quot;signature block&quot; by Merrick, starting &quot;Tis true, my form is something odd/but blaming me, is blaming God...&quot; is often (incorrectly) quoted or cited as a work by Isaac Watts. In fact only the last few sentences were penned by Watts (&quot;False Greatness&quot;, book II-Horae lyricae 1743) starting &quot;Mylo, forbear to call him bless&#x27;d/That only boasts a large estate...&quot;

*&quot;This Is the Day the Lord Hath Made&quot;
*&quot;&#x27;Tis by Thy Strength the Mountains Stand&quot;
*&quot;When I Can Read My Title Clear&quot;
*&quot;I Sing the Mighty Power of God&quot; (originally entitled &quot;Praise for Creation and Providence&quot; from &quot;Divine Songs Attempted in Easy Language for the Use of Children&quot;)
*&quot;My Shepherd Will Supply My Need&quot; (based on Psalm 23)
*&quot;Bless, O My Soul! the Living God&quot; (based on Psalm 103)

Many of Watts&#x27; hymns are included in the Anglican Hymns Ancient and Modern, the Oxford Book of Common Praise, the United Reformed Church&#x27;s Mission Praise, the Christadelphian hymnal, the Episcopal Church&#x27;s &quot;Hymnal 1982&quot;, &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot;, the Baptist Hymnal, the Presbyterian Trinity Hymnal, and the Methodist Hymns and Psalms. Many of his texts are also used in the American hymnal, &quot;The Sacred Harp,&quot; using what is known as the shape note notation used for teaching non-musicians. Several of his hymns are used in the hymnals of the Church of Christ, Scientist and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<text>Maria Antonietta Beluzzi (26 July 1930 – 6 August 1997) was an Italian actress who appeared in a number of films in her native country. She is probably best known as the large and huge-breasted tobacconist in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Amarcord&quot;, whose sexual arousal by the male teenager protagonist ends with ironic results. This casting occurred ten years after Fellini first cast her in an uncredited role (as a screen test candidate for &quot;La Saraghina&quot;) in &quot;8½&quot;.

In a minor plot point, her performance in &quot;Amarcord&quot; is discussed fondly by the characters in John Irving&#x27;s &quot;Until I Find You&quot; (2005).
